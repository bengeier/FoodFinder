{"text":"Waited an hour to be seated after being told 20-30 minutes. Then it took another hour from being asked for drinks to receiving our food. The waiter seems to be overwhelmed with work while the 5 greeters just just fooled around. First and last time at this location."}
{"text":"Been waiting 40 min for 1 Sirloin Steak. ..at lunch...they are not busy....looks good inside..but my wife and I will not be returning.  Sad for a beautiful place...customer service is poor"}
{"text":"I went here on friday night because I was celebrating my graduation with my family. We had to wait like 45 minutes but, it was expected for a friday night. When we got seated, we got seated by a very nice hostess. She was polite and talkative. She seated us in a nice booth. We waited a little while before we were helped by our waitress but when she did help us she gave us what we wanted. She seemed very distracted and like she didn't give us all of her attention but its understandable she was busy so no worries. The food was excellent! better than I expected. I had the Terriyaki sirloin and it was a great! I loved it because it was sweet, and I was still able to taste the meat. I will come back again."}
{"text":"We waited patiently for 45 min to get seated for our table. It then took over 30 min to order are drinks. After we ordered our food it took 45 min to bring it out. But they brought the appetizer AND our food at the same time.... Kinda defeats the purpose huh? It was a Friday night and it was a little busy. BUT it doesn't take 30 min to order a drink and common sense to bring the appetizer and the food at the same time. Extremely disappointed..."}
{"text":"Black Angus is a great stop for a nice family steak dinner. Have always had consistency at this location. Friendly and attentive staff.  We often dine in the lounge because we take our time and don't want to occupy a dinning room table excessively.  Never rushed in the lounge but have dinned in the main restaurant many times with equal pleasure.  It's a nice place.  The value is reasonable. Food good.  Try it.

One addition.  It's 44 outside.  Turn the A/C down!   Someone in management should be aware of this.  That I have to put a jacket on to eat dinner is just wrong. Pay attention and adjust accordingly!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a couple of weeks ago.  The Friday night (6pm) we visited, the place was pretty empty.  

Anyhow, we used one of those coupons we got through the mail, in which we can get a complete meal for two for $38.  Since there were four of us, the waitress said we can apply the coupon for two complete meals; fine by us!

With the coupon, we got:
* Jumbo Prawn Cocktail ($9.99); the prawns were cooked and chilled just right and the cocktail sauce had quite a kick to it (very good)

* Wagon Wheel Sampler Platter ($12.99); the only things I liked off this platter were the shrimp cocktail and buffalo chicken tenders

* Three orders of 1/2 Pound Cut Prime Rib ($17.99 each); I ordered mine medium rare, and it was juicy and cooked perfectly

* Top Sirloin , Center Cut ($16.99); my sister ordered hers medium well and felt it was overcooked

* Two orders of Big Mountain Chocolate Fudge Cake ($5.99 each); the actual cake tasted cold, like it was a few days old, but once we poured the chocolate sauce on it, the dessert tasted better.  

If we didn't have the coupon, the above listed items would total $105.92.  With the coupon, the total was $76 (a discount of $29.92)...not too shabby.  

I also ordered \"The Gold Strike Margarita\", which was delicious!  

Our bill (pretax) came to $97.01, so I felt we got a pretty good deal.

Oh yeah, our waitress was really sweet and attentive...and didn't treat us any different because we used the coupon.  ;-P"}
{"text":"The beer prices are ridiculously high. Cost is $7 for 25 oz draft beer!!  I am a coupon keeper and had one for Black Angus. Unfortunately I forgot it  but Tony (our bartender/server) had some extras and we got the lunch \"special\" for $7.99 each. WITH a coupon discount food prices were comparable to other places' prices.  We won't eat here WITHOUT a discount. Hubby had French dip, that he said was good. When I asked him he said it was as good as where we usually eat. (Gallaghers) I had chicken,avacado,&bacon sandwich that was pretty good too. We were looking for Buzztime Trivia (as always) and wanted somewhere different. We come here maybe once every 2-3 months."}
{"text":"I intentionally walked in to this place on a Friday night with a wait list. Much to my surprise, the list was gone through very efficiently, and the staff was attentive to the needs of those waiting. I ordered a NY Strip med which came back a little more like Mid-Well. Although for the quality I found it to be a little overpriced, but aside from, the visit was acceptable.

{"text":"We went there on Valentine's day, late afternoon with no reservation and only had to wait an hour for a table.   We shopped nearby to pass the time and were seated when we came back in 45 minutes.  The restaurant was very busy for the holiday, but service was good, the food was prepared well and the serving sizes were very large.   We had the two for $58 special which included a full size appetizer, (a steak quesadilla prepared very well with lots of steak and cheese), a sizable entr√©e and two sides and dessert to share.  Our salads were large and well prepared.   The loaded baked potato was very tasty with all the trimmings.   I had the 12oz pork chop which was very lean and expertly broiled.   My wife had a 12 oz new your strip which she found cooked exactly as she wanted.   The steak seemed to have a large amount of fat along one side fat and perhaps should have trimmed the steak prior to cooking but overall she found it very tasty and quite good.   The Mud Pie desert was the full size desert, and quite plentiful for two to split.  This was our first experience at this restaurant and will come back."}
{"text":"We came here for my mothers 55th birthday. We called a week ahead of time to make the reservation to be sure we would be seated appropriately. When arrived a bit early before our reservation time, which was 5pm. They refused to seat us until we were all present. After everyone arrive at 5:10, they took another ten minutes to seat us. They seated us in the middle of restaurant at a makeshift table. After we asked if they had anything other than two four-people tables for our party of 9, they explained that someone had seated a party of two people, who had NOT had a reservation, at the table they had reserved for us. When the table was available again, they seated another two person party at this table and kept is into the center if the restaurant. They gave us a couple free appetizers and kissed our butts for the rest of the night, probably hoping for a decent tip. The food was okay, but the appetizers where the best part, which is sad for a \"nice\" restaurant. The steaks were tough and bland and the mashed potatoes, which were supposed to taste garlicky, tasted like the boxed potatoes you buy for a buck at Walmart. Overall, I was unimpressed. Next birthday, we'll head over to Longhorn Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Expensive and not very good. Not a great combo. Def use the coupons that come in the mail I ur even considering it"}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely lost its touch, the food was unappetizing and the experience was super boring. I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Another good meal here.  I had a coupon for a free appetite for my birthday and they gave me the free lobster tail special and brought me a desert for free. Everyone enjoyed their meal an we had excellent service.  I'm not a chain fan, but this place is very good.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Hey...it's a chain restaurant with good food.  We had the campfire feast and split it among my wife and son and I.  It was good food and good service...what more could you ask for a meal at a reasonable price with the campfire deal.

Not sure why some expect 5 star experience from a chain restaurant, but this was good all the way around.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Updating my old post::

This post is for the bar area, not the actual dining portion of the restaurant. I will not critique the menu or food, but will say that it is slightly expensive and nothing spectacular. If you are going to eat here, get the prime rib, it is delicious.

The happy hour has changed from 1/2 price drinks to a tiered structure. Off hand, I know that bottles of beer and beers on tap are $3, but I do not know the other items. Beers on tap include Bud, Bud light, Coors Light, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, Bass Ale, Guinness stout, and shock top. The bar atmosphere is relaxing, and the staff is very friendly. They are converting the bar to something they call a \"bulls-eye bar\", which is focused on sports. They will have multiple TV's around the walls, and introduce a new bar menu for dinner. 

This isn't a bad place if you're looking to go somewhere nice."}
{"text":"Went there with my Wife on a Friday eve to treat her a little, unfortunately it turned out to be a bust.

The food was not great, much worse than I expected for a dinner for two which ended up costing us $100 without even having desserts.

My steak ended up being overcooked, I ordered medium-rare and it barely had any pink so it was over medium, my wife's was under-cooked, I believe they may have switched the instruction on the order. Food was pretty boring and bland and I wanted to order an extra sauce to save it but I was hungry and the server did not come round for 20 min so I just gave up.

Service was generally poor and we waited forever for our order to come out.

My wife does not like tequila so ordered a Margarita with no tequila in it which was delivered with tequila :( My drink looked awesome but tasted pretty bland in the end, what a disappointment ...

We were also seated at an awkwardly placed large table with lots of traffic which kind of spoiled the little romantic evening we had in mind.

Couple of weeks later we went to the Keg across at the fashion mall, ended up having a fantastic time there, excellent food and it cost less, so in comparison this was actually quite terrible.

After complaining to my friends about it I got a pretty unanimous response, they have all been there and had I asked they would have warned me not to go."}
{"text":"Went there with my daughter and I had a coupon for the free lobster with any steak.  They were very accommodating.   She ordered the steak and I got the lobster plus one of her sides.  Her steak was delicious as was my lobster and loaded baked potato.    She did complain her side of onion rings was only 4 rings...very small for a small side.    Anyway we both left full but won't be coming back because of the price.  Only tried it because of the coupon.  We can get just as tasty steak at Outback or Texas Roadhouse for a fraction of the price as B.A.      I gave it 4 stars as the food and service was good but the price is way to high."}
{"text":"Our server was less than great but the manager Paul brought out our food, got us refills, cleared plates from the table and checked on us multiple times. His personality and service made this such a great Saturday night family dinner!"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service.  Much less noisy than roadhouse that's down the road. If you get the coupons in the money mailer packs, you get a huge meal for 2 for only $40"}
{"text":"I think people over the years forgot how good this place is . Being a native I know better, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I like Black Angus, but this time we had the worst experience. First off, they gave my fiancee a Bud light when he asked for Coors Light on tap. The appetizer ( teriyaki steak lettuce wraps) had a good taste, but the steak was tough. we ordered two steak dinners.The first one, was a New York (it was not a New York and it was tough).The second one was a Teriyaki Top Sirloin (this steak had too much teriyaki-way too strong, I could only eat about four pieces). The green beans were tough and too much pepper WOW. Also,  they were completely out of Prime Rib, which is really why we went to black Angus."}
{"text":"We had a coupon and was craving steak so we went here. Let's start with at 6pm on a Saturday it was empty but for an older group. The decor would make you think you where at grandmas house. The place was dark and was not very inviting. We decided to share the filet and I wanted it rare it was raw cold and fatty. I know they are not a high end place but it was just cheap. Chewy and tasted like it was thrown in a broiler. They offered to bring something else, so I had potato soup and it was bland, boring, and lacking anything that would make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, perfectly cooked steak, great apps, great house brew. Will return often."}
{"text":"I have had enjoyable experiences at other Black Angus restaurants, however,  due to poor service I will not be coming back for quite some time. First, the waitress was not very friendly or interactive. She was late on refills as well. After we finished our meal we noticed that we did not receive bread like all the other tables. I had the baby back ribs and they were good, not great. Overall would have been a much better review rating had there been adequate service. Would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. My wife had the salmon and I had the French dip. Hers was sent back for being to dry and unflavored. My dipping sauce tasted like a dogs bath water. And the samich sucked too."}
{"text":"Came in tonight 30min before closing and expected below average service but boy was I wrong, everyone from the hostess to our server Richard was great and didn't make us feel rushed at all. We ordered their campfire feast for 2 and had enough to take home for lunch the next day. Great first impression, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First of all we arrived just before closing and It took a very long time to get seated. Then waited approximately 20 mins. To place our order. Our waitress was preoccupied washing bar glasses.Service was slow the sides were o.k salad and baked potatoes .The meat on the other hand terrible my wife had 8 oz. sirlon cooked med. tough as shoe leather.I had there world famous prime rib at best cooked med well  I ordered rare.The 12 oz. piece may have started out rare but the microwave destroyed that in re-heating.Restaurant filthy ,dirty silver wear  had food stuck on it . We will deffinetly not return to Black Angus arrowhead ."}
{"text":"I am enjoying the offer given by Black Angus to us veterans, a very tasty bacon cheeseburger. Everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.... food OK. Prices were extremely high, could have looked past but service was horrible."}
{"text":"I am trying to like Black Angus because I love steak and their sweet potato fries are delicious - when dining in... but every single to go order I've placed in the past year and a half has been a failure. I would give them 0 stars if I could.

1. Their steak is either overcooked (one time it was burnt!!!) or way undercooked. Last week I ordered a medium and a medium rare and they both came rare!!! 
2. Their fillet mignion is nothing but cartilage and fat... I guess that's what I get for ordering their $15 fillet mignion special... I can't believe they even have the gutts to call it steak!!! 
3. If you order sweet potato fries as part of your to go order, more often than not you will get their left overs - burnt, bits and pieces of sweet potatoes. Unacceptable!
4. Their lobster is like rubber.
5. Several times they did not add bread to my order because they ran out... how about trying to make it up to me? Isn't complimentary bread included in the overall cost of the food?!
6. Stay away from their side caesar salad! It's whilted. 

I would never place a to go order with Black Angus - they take advantage of the fact that you can't check what they pack up for you and then charge you up for premium steak dinner! Save your money and go to The Keg or Firebird's. They are a little pricier but the food is top notch. Given that my to go experience with Black Angus has been so disappointing, I will definitely not dine in there again either. Their dining experience has not been much better in terms of food quality, and the last time we went there we were left standing for 10 minutes before anyone even ackowledged us."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Black Angus. My experience was horrible. My food was not fresh. It was cold, disgusting and nothing was season! It was like they gave me leftover food. And to be honest I almost threw up. Ugh!!! NEVER AGAIN! 

I wouldn't recommend this place to a dog!"}
{"text":"I am a little mixed on this review, as i have had mediocre steak there, and just recently, one of the best ribeyes I have ever had.  The campfire feast is a great value, and has really good entrees included.  Service has always been good, from the bar, down to the wait staff.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had Dinner there last night with my Wife and Oldest Son, meal was great along with the service. Ordered a To Go plate and it was great. Parking Lot was full but we still got seated as soon as we walked in. I'll be visiting again, Great Job."}
{"text":"I've had very good meals here.  Look for their coupons in flyers or the newspaper for specials--such as steak, lobster, and shrimp with two sides for under twenty dollars.  You can't beat that.  And there's fresh bread for each table.  Have found this particular restaurant to be a bit nicer inside than other Black Angus restaurants.  My experiences there have all been very good."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this black Angus for 19 yrs and always had a wonderful time.
Omg tonight was completely different. It started with rude hostess setting 4 people at a bar table. We asked to change then out of jack daniel. What restaurant runs out of a premier brand. 
Next prime rib ordered med we get rare.
They offered mud pie free of change and we thx them but asked for cookie dessert. It wasn't the dessert change it was the facial expressions that was disturbing.
The customer service was awful by the manager!!!!
The waitress was sweet and wonderful!
By the way the new menus are also awful.
With the lack if customers this place will be closed in 6 months!!!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and pass on this place..horrible apathetic service!
 I didnt get a set up,no bread, salad came same time as steak...some of the worst service i have ever had,go to The Keg or even The Outback before here!!"}
{"text":"The most important thing I can tell you is to read these reviews!  Everything said is accurate.  The last time I had dinner at a Black Angus was in the late 70's--didn't like it then and nothing much has changed in 30 years.

Dark, dingy and outdated interior.  Service was slow. 

My nephew loves this place and we had a coupon for the Campfire Feast for Two, so I tried it once again.

I don't eat red meat much so I had the chicken--dry, flavorless and overcooked.  Broccoli was great, steamed to perfection.  The appetizer dish was a sampler of all appetizers--everything fried, over cooked, dried out  like jerky--not good.

We also were given a choice of dessert, chocolate layer cake is what we selected--it was okay, but nothing special.

Sad to say but Black Angus has left a big black hole in my memory---no shining star here........"}
{"text":"We haven't been here for about a year so decided to give it a try again.
Again the quality of food at this location, for the price is terrible. We've gone to other Black Angus's and this is not even close.
For a quality steak at a good price Texas Roadhouse beats them hands down."}
{"text":"Service was good, could have been a little faster but the waitress was nice and quickly refilled all drinks at the table. 

The kids at the table had fun and enjoyed their meals. The two adults I went with couldn't finish all their chicken so they boxed it to go. I had an 8 ounce teryiyaki steak with sweet potato fries and sauteed green beans and the portion size was just right for me. The flavor of the fries was good, the steak and green beans were nice as well. I gave specific directions on how to cook the steak, and they followed through.

It's not Nobu, but it was a good, family friendly experience with food that isn't remarkable, but more than adequate for the type of joint it is. I can imagine that the quality of the service can vary, and impact the score quite a bit more than the quality of the chefs in the kitchen. On this night, we had good service, I hope you will too if you go there."}
{"text":"The bad reviews are spot on. STAY AWAY!!! Very nice service and it's a shame the food is so very disappointing! Bug on the menu and empty booths should have been our clue."}
{"text":"Excellent service from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave. Food was good with the exception of the appetizer that were a little bit overcooked/burned. The main entree was good and the Garlic Mashed Potatoes really good."}
{"text":"Me and my father have had steaks here a couple times. Everytime we have had prompt, friendly service. Never a problem. The Filet Mignon is absolutely delectable, tender, and oh-so-flavorful. My father has Top Sirloin, which he also enjoys.

With Asparagus and the sauteed Mushrooms & Onions - god, it is SOOOO GOOD!

Recommend this place highly. However, the problem is that the prices are kinda steep, so it needs to be for a semi-special occasion. For very special occasions, Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is tops (and $$$$)."}
{"text":"I visited here a couple weeks ago. We were celebrating my husband's birthday. Worse mistake ever!!!!! If I could give zero stars I would. We waited and hour for our food. Which was pretty sad being that they were super slow the night we went. I have a 2 1/2 yr old  and if anyone else has kids they know it's pretty hard to keep them patient especially when it's dinner time and there hungry. When we finally received our dinner my husband had ordered salmon and broccoli as a side he literally had a 1 stem of broccoli! I then asked for a manager who asked if he wanted more and if she could get him something else. He said no by that time we were pretty fed up with the wait time and getting that in return. I had him take our daughter out since it was taking a while to get the bill. I can say I honestly was looking for the manager to compensate for all of that, what we got was sorry about the wait have a good night. That really pissed me off and I will never return to that restaurant. I paid over $60 for that dinner and it was not worth a penny."}
{"text":"here for my little cousins proposal dinner, first time being to black angus in years..... and first time to this location.
because of how many people in our party we are at separate tables, there are 3 waitresses assigned to this party to say the least.....
absolute worst experience i've ever had or seen.
this is a prime example of why i never bring my family here......
way better service, food, and pricing @ texas road house......"}
{"text":"We were at the restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday.  The server was very nice and quick to bring drinks and refills.  It took a long time for our steaks to arrive.  I ordered the New York strip steak cooked medium.  When the steak finally came, it was very rare.  It was also the fattiest New York strip I have ever seen.  When our server came to check on us, I showed her that my steak was not cooked properly and mentioned the amount of fat on it.  She agreed that the steak was undercooked, apologized and took it back to the kitchen.  It took longer to get the steak the second time than it did the first time.  By the time it arrived, my wife and son were both already done eating their meals.  They had brought me the same fatty steak that I had sent back (I know since I had cut it in half to show the server how red it was).  It was brought out by the manager who then stood over me and waited for me to check that it was cooked properly.  When I asked why it took so long, he gave me a smart remark about making sure it was done right this time.  If that steak had been on the grill the whole time that I was waiting, it would have been super-well done.  At least 25% of the steak was fat and was left on the plate when I was done.  At the conclusion of the meal, our server did bring a birthday dessert for my wife.  That was nice, but the meal was a failure.  No offer of a discount from the manager for the poor preparation of the steak, the long wait or the quality of the steak.  There are plenty of steak restaurants around this location and we will be taking our business to one of those restaurants in the future.  If you really want to eat at Black Angus, do yourself a favor and take the extra 10 minutes to drive to the Metro Center (Phx) location.  Perhaps that one is managed better than this location."}
{"text":"If you request Roy for your waiter when you make your reservation your dining experience will be exceptional!!!"}
{"text":"Was pretty slow for a Wednesday but nice and quiet.  My husband, son and I went for dinner.  Ordered the 2  for $58 meal and I got the top sirloin and prawns.  Appetizer was cold!! Flat bread is supposed to be hot.  Salads were good and a good size.  Dinner came out nice and hot and cooked great! The two Ribeye's were kind of fatty but cooked as asked, hot and good.  Service was ok, kind of slow and far between but ok.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Tried this place because we had a coupon.  Wow.  Very pricey for what you get and very dirty.  Carpet stains and sticky furniture.  But, what do we know.   The place seems to have customers every night. 

Just not us."}

{"text":"My mom was raving about the grilled artichoke app she had here & said my hubby & I had to join her & my dad for dinner sometime. We went on Friday night at 7:30. The place wasn't busy but it wasn't dead either. The decor is pretty dated & not really my style, but I did like the taller booths for added privacy. 

My dad started off with a martini (which is so unlike him), my hubby opted for an appletini, I decided to try the cowboy sangria & my mom got a virgin pina colada. The boys enjoyed their martinis (hard to mess those up), mom also enjoyed her pina colada & my sangria was pretty good (too many seeds from the blackberries though). My hubby & I also tried their cranberry iced tea, he didn't like it but I did & drank both of ours. The bread & butter they bring out is yummy, I believe it was a pumpernickel. For an app we tried the grilled artichokes my mom kept talking up (she even ordered 1 to have with her entree, so that's 3 total!). 3 halves came on 1 order with a couple mayo-based dipping sauces, all I tasted was the mayo so I didn't care for them. The artichokes were pretty good but the server who brought them out told us that they grill them ahead of time & then microwave them before they bring them out, ew. My parents shared the steak & lobster special, dad chose the 8oz top sirloin (med-rare) & upgraded to the 9-10oz lobster tail for $3 more. For sides they chose the wedge salad & baked potato. Hubby went with the steak & seafood & had the filet mignon (med) with fried shrimp, for sides he chose the wild rice & broccoli. I decided on the 6oz bacon wrapped filet mignon (med-rare), with the garlic mashed potatoes & broccoli. The lobster was bland & needed seasoning, the sides were all generic tasting & my steak was very rare (dad's was also but he enjoys bloody red, I prefer more of a pink). For dessert we all split the chocolate fudge cake. It was seriously enough for 6 people it was huge, but pretty good. 

Total (not including tip) was about $160, which isn't bad considering all the food & drinks we ordered, but the food was boring & tasteless. Service was great though, which is why I gave 2 stars, the food deserved only 1!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. She had 3 tables and felt overwhelmed. Manager was just as bad, vary rude, and does not now how to serve with a smile. Would not recommend this restaurant, because of the service. When you pay a lot for a meal you should get good service. Your not getting what you pay for. Walks right by not even asking how you doing, can I get you another drink."}
{"text":"We frequent this particular restaurant quite often and find that we always receive both excellent service and food.  Last week I forgot my receipt that I needed for reimbursement.  I called the restaurant and spoke with Nicole who helped identify my server and was able to retrieve my receipt, she then went above and beyond her job description and mailed the receipt to me.  That speaks highly for the service there."}
{"text":"The service and food is nothing but top notch.  I am fortunate to live close by.  Matt runs a tight ship.  If you want quality food with a friendly face, this is the place to go.  The bar staff is the friendliest that I have ever met.  Servers remember your name and what you like.  I don't have enough great things to say about Paulino.  If anyone knows how to finesse a quality cut, it is him.  Be certain to pop in at the bar and say hi to Ryan and Jordan.  They are down to earth great people.  Love the food here.  The Keg or anyone around has nothing on the meat.  And be certain to come in for Prime Rib Wednesday."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to this location 2 or 3 times a month because the food (usually the lunch feast or Campfire Feast  of Prime Rib for two) has always been very good and  we are happy with how it is prepared.  We became unhappy with our last two visits because our server made our dining experience less than pleasant - seemed not very experienced and not friendly (almost bossy) and negligent about refilling our drinks, serving the bread without plates or knife  - it was in the bar area and she spent most of the time at the bar talking!!!
We decided to wait for a couple of weeks to go back and I was prepared to object if we were taken to the bar area - but thankfully, we were seated in the dining room.  We
had such a pleasant lunch with Amber as our server and we'll definitely go back and request her!!!"}
{"text":"Got the wheel sampler: Was not impressed. Chicken was ok. Shrimp was ok but for three shrimps the sauce was too much. Zuccini was not too good.Loaded potato skin was good, thanks to the sour cream on it. 

Filet mignon was cooked too perfection. Au gratin potatoes was good. As far as the steak soup, too salty and heavy,not really a fan. 

Bread pudding with icecream was delicious but then I have to yet have a dessert that I don't like with icecream. Overall I had a good experience. However I'd recommend using coupons since the price was a bit steep for such an experience. The other star was deducted because food gave me a ...  I am not sure what was the reason.

I'd recommend them to change/tweak their sides... Definitely steak soup should be replaced with another type of soup."}
{"text":"With a heavy heart i have to say i will not be coming back here. This place used to be so good before. Last August for my birthday I decided to come here for dinner. They sat us really quick, however NOBODY ever came to ask us for our drinks, etc. My husband and I were just sitting there looking around. However, there were a few waiters that walked by and saw we were waiting for somebody to come to our table, and they didn't bother to come ask if we had been helped already. After 15 minutes of waiting i told my husband we were leaving. Im usually not a complainer but i was so upset, i talked to the manager on my way out. He was very apologetic and gave me a gift card. This past Sunday we finally went back after 8 months, thinking it would be good service/food. I asked the waitress to bring my drink with my food, and halfway being done she came over and asked me if i wanted my drink now. I replied umm no thanks im almost done. She didn't apologize. The loaded baked potatoe was so dry and stiff. The sweet potatoe fries were not even hot, as if they had just been sitting there. I used to love this place, but that definitely made me realize this place has gone downhill. I'm never coming back"}
{"text":"Waited an hour tonight for a table...when we finally got seated the table was dirty! Food all over the bench and a bit on the table itself! Gross! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"First and last time eating here.  Service and atmosphere were great.  However, ordered the 14oz New York Strip steak.  After sawing off 13oz of gristle and fat the last ounce needed steak sauce to help out the taste.  Usually if I'm paying this much for a steak I number 1 don't want to have to carve out more than half of the steak in fat and gristle and 2 don't want to have to use steak sauce.  They don't serve Dr. Pepper or Mr. Pibb.  Who does that?  I believe Walmart sells better steak for a fraction of the price and they sell whatever beverage you would like.  Bottom line, this place is overpriced for the quality of food you receive."}
{"text":"I love everything about Black Angus. The steaks are great, bread is amazing, and the campfire meal for 2 is a great deal. They also have anniversary Moscow Mule cups for only $7.00!"}
{"text":"I go to the B.A. at arrowhead every time the 2 for $39 coupon comes out but this time decided to go to the one in Goodyear. Big mistake. We ordered the Loaded potato skins for our appetizer and when they came we still had not recieved our bread so I asked as she was bringing the appetizer she said it was not ready yet and walked away then I look down at the potato skins and  they were extremely burnt and hard as a rock. Not even a minute later waitress comes by and quickly sets bread down and walks away. Then the manager comes to the table behind us and the lady at the table was complaining that she received shrimp instead of prawns and wanted the meal for free. The manager was trying to talk her into a $1 discount and a remake(can you believe? a frickin dollar) The lady became louder and louder and started cussing because the manager was not bending so this went on for 10 minutes and she starts dropping F bombs. BOOM free meal. So we were subjected to this obnoxious convo for 10 minutes just so he could give her what she asked for all along. Then our meals came. Steak was excellent but onion rings like the appetizer were burnt to a crisp. I do not like confrontation and after seeing what the lady behind me had to do to get action I paid the bill and left. The next day I filed a complaint on their website and within a hour that store manager called apologizing profusely and saying I should have brought it to their immediate attention. So she ends the convo by asking me \"did she address my concerns and could she do anything to make me come back... I could not believe she was going to put it on me to ask for a discounted or free meal instead of saying, \"this is what I'm going to do for this horrible experience\" NO, I have to tell her what to do. so I said nothing because I figured the other lady wanted free and was offered $1 off if they said that to me I would end up cussing her out. It should not be up to me to tell her how I want it resolved. From now on I will go to Longhorn."}
{"text":"Good meal, excellent service. We had a large group for dinner. We had 1 waitress, and a second who was assisting. The food was all good, and came out to the table correctly (3 tables, 15 people) so kudos. Stop by and enjoy a good cut of steak. One individual quite enjoyed their pork chops, as well."}
{"text":"The food was great after a long day in the car, but the highlight of our dining experience was our waitress! Kalli's service was super quick and she was so helpful, cheery, and attentive that she really made our evening delightful.  We'll be back next week!"}
{"text":"It's bad enough when you get poor service, but when the manager lies about sending the waitress home? That's just tacky. Two coworkers and I had dinner this evening at this location and will not be returning. 

Drinks (water and a beer) took a good ten minutes to arrive after our waitress took the order. Food was likewise slow- partly because she made a second trip to the table to re-write the orders again. When food did arrive, one buddy didn't get his steak. At all. It was comp'd but still...

At the end, our waitress came by and asked about to go boxes, water, etc. She ignored the checks and cards on the edge of the table and left. I had to take the bills up front so we could pay and leave. ."}
{"text":"worst servers ever. Our family dinner of 7 easy $300 and you would think that we should have had great service. RUINED RUINED by staff. Did not check in on us, drinks took 10 min. to refill, asked for more bread and we get 1 cause our waitress clearly pointed out to me it's against policy to even give us bread before we place an order. I would STRONGLY suggest go somewhere else for any special occasion."}
{"text":"So, I took the family here for my birthday dinner with with the expectation of a decent steak and contentment all around.  Now, it's been years since I last experienced a Black Angus and I remember that experience being rather decent, return-worthy even.

As mentioned in a previous review - the place was kind of a ghostown, albeit a Sunday night, but still.

The staff was nice enough, and since it was my birthday I had gotten an email with a buy one get one free deal.  Well, I forgot the email and with and iPhone in my pocket I hoped I would be able to show them the email and they'd honor it - no such luck - the waiter stated something about corporate policy requiring that email on paper - this is not Seth Godin in action.

My wife and I both ordered the Ribeye as part of the $50 for 2 meal with an appetizer and two sides each, one desert to split.  The kiddos each order the mac and cheese (Kraft, out of the box, $6, reallY!?!)

The zucchini appetizer was decent enough - even the kids ate a piece each - and plenty to share.

The steaks sucked - I've had better steak from room service that cost the same.  Rather dry, not very well seasoned - the only thing going for them was that I was hungry!

As a token of good faith - the waiter offered up a second desert for free in lieu of my birthday email offer - let's see - a $5 desert in place of a $25 meal - nice try - FAIL!

So it became obvious after the fact that there was a reason this place was a ghostown - regardless of the Sunday night or not - We will not be returning to Stuart Anderson's - probably ever."}
{"text":"We go here from time to time for a special treat and this time it was my husbands birthday. They were so incredibly generous giving us free steak dinner and large cookie skillet with ice cream as a birthday gift. The service was impecible and our waiter even broght us a hot towel to wipe our hands on. You really cant go wrong with the food and service of this place. We made our reservations for Easter!!! I can't forget to mention this Philly cheese type sandwich they make with filet Mignon. Speechless. Bravo staff at Black Angus in Goodyear."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a late lunch and we were craving Prime Rib - we left another restaurant because they didn't serve Prime Rib until after 4:00pm.  We were very thankful we came here!!!  Ambiance soothing, noise level terrific, service (Lacey (?))  impeccable, and food was fantastic!!!  We definitely will be returning time after time. Also presentation of the food was spot on!!!"}
{"text":"Had not been to a black angus in a long time and was near by and went in for dinner. We got the pork chops and garlic mashed potatoes and union rings. The only thing with any flavor was the onion rings. The potatoes were flavorless crap. I'm never going back. You can get a much better meal at Waffel House"}
{"text":"I usually get the filet which is excellent!  However, I made the mistake of ordering the crispy shrimp, which I would have sent back except that I was with 5 others and it was my sisters birthday so I did not want to make a fuss. I ate the overdone, small shrimp while I watched the others eat their excellent steaks. I will go back for the steak but will never order anything else. The rest of the food was very good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We had a Campfire Feast coupon for $40; which was a great deal so we decided to go on a Friday night for date night.The food, service and atmosphere was fabulous at Black Angus. I took reviewers advice and ordered the baked potato soup and it was awesome as promised! Teriyaki chicken was delightful, as was the cowboy sangria. My man had prime rib which tasted great and came still mooing just like he likes, with a great au jus and hot raw horseradish. We finished with the chocolate chip cookie which was gooey and delish. Overall, it was a fantastic meal and we will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Decided to have a family dinner there Saturday night.  Got there at 5:00 with NO reservations for 9 people.  They were very accommodating and sat us in 5 minutes.  We had two waitresses watching over us and even though 2 in our party came in late and ordered after us, our meals came out at the same time.  Everyone in our party raved about the food.  Must say it was a great experience and we would not hesitate to go back SOON!"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous, but the service is what will ensure that we come back. Lovely experience. The food came to our table within minutes of ordering it. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised how delicious the prime rib seasoning and creamy horseradish sauce tasted."}
{"text":"Seems like each time we go to this Black Angus it gets worse and worse. The service has always been slow but at our last visit it took 2 hours for dinner. The portions keep getting smaller and the staff is less than helpful. Flagging someone down for drink refills and to pay our bill is unacceptable especially considering the cost of the dinner."}
{"text":"I must say I am super disappointed with this place. My brother got dry, dark, artificial tasting mash potatoes. My wild rice was super dry. My asparagus was super burnt. Enough said. I will not be returning. I expected more for the prices. Actually I don't ever expect dry and burnt food no matter what the price is."}
{"text":"Mediocre taste. Prime rib was dry and didn't have much flavor. Shrimp cocktail were small, wife ordered 9 oz lobster and it was dry and looked more like a 6 oz tail. Flourless chocolate cake was also mediocre. Disappointed,  not going back. Prices are high for mediocre flavored dishes. Outback steakhouse is much much better. Sorry Black Angus."}
{"text":"We always have a great meal at Black Angus. The Bullseye Bar has very reasonable happy hour specials. The shrimp cocktail is excellent- love the sauce. Clip the coupon for the dinner for two - a wonderful deal. Service is superb ask; for Terrance. Manager Jason goes out of his way to make your visit a pleasant one. Lover the atmosphere. We are never disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was pretty good but the setting, furniture was dated, had a slight smell of old, at least at the arrowhead location. I would not return to that location."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it it was very good and is my favorite place in town now.  Next time I'm in town I will be sure to visit the service was great."}
{"text":"Did not appreciate the tough, thin, tiny steak. The shrimp were good, but this is supposed to be a steak house, right? Wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"My mom and i come to black angus about once a week.   We come back because we can get exactly what we want.   Our steaks are cooked to perfection and  so are the potatoes, not to mention we start our meal with a delicious salad. 
Cheerful little Lori in the front always greats is with a smile and knows we won't sit anywhere but in Lori the bartenders section. Lori beings my mom's glass of wine and my tea as sioon as we sit down. ...she is the best.   She always remembers exactly what we like from the cut of our steak  to our cookies.  Sitting in Lori's area it is so oblivious she cares about all her guests the same,  she is very attentive and equally friendly. 
Lori is always neat, professional , courteous and most of all a great server.   We look forward to our lunches and our visits with her."}
{"text":"Worst experience at Black Angus ever, steaks weren't cooked right and they were really thin, waitress wasn't attentive at all. She even forgot the next tables salads until they were done eating. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite eatery!! Never had a bad meal and always leave very full. Great food love the prime rib and their teriyaki steak is to die for. Sign up for their emails and get specials you can get great deals like lunch for $8.99 !!! Where else can you get a steak , potato and a salad for that price?  You can't and its black angus meat too!! They have awesome drinks too!!! Oh yea they have birthday specials also.  Hurry and try it you won't be sorry!!!!!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and are used to go have lunch there on Friday. About a couple times a month we also go have dinner. They recognize us as regular. It is usually good except once once in a while when my husband's steak comes undercook. Bloody is NOT medium well. I order chicken because who can mess up chicken, right?
The manager comps his lunch every time it happens, although we never asked for anything. 
But we stopped going because it makes me uncomfortable.

Today, we had some shopping to do in the area and we decided to give it another shot. My husband promised he would not say anything...
I felt totally unwelcome. Our waitress was unpleasant and sarcastic. The manager himself brought our plates and insisted my husband checks his meat. I bet he has his photo in the kitchen ;)  

Overall the atmosphere was hostile and I left with the clear impression that we were not welcome. Bottom line, we won't ever go back to this unfriendly place and will take our business elsewhere.

If you plan to go there, just know it's kind of a hit and miss with both the food and the service. At times, the food is good and/or the service great. Other times, food is less than average and/or the service lousy. I do not think the place is dirty, except for the bathroom."}
{"text":"I really like this steak house it's one of my favorites. The steak is cooked perfectly (accurately cooked according to your request) juicy, tender and simply delicious. The sides are just as delicious and I absolutely LOVE their fried zucchini appetizer. Oh and yes it is a great place for a date night, in fact the first time I ever came here was one a first date! lol Anyway, definitely a go-to place if you are in the Goodyear/Avondale area."}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars, flame broiled steak was so delicious and the steak and shrimp duo was a perfect deal. The steak was cooked perfectly and the brussel sprouts were so amazing!! Carlye was a wonderful waitress, she made us all feel welcome and took great care of us. I love it when servers treat my son like a person too. Nicole the general manager came to see us to ensure our dinner was good, she's so awesome! I felt as if it anything went wrong (which it didn't) they would have gone above and beyond to correct it. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I think this place is kind of outdated and better steaks can be had at a lot of other places. We went there because we're mexican and we had a coupon. Seriously, we laught about it, old people and mexicans go there because we have a coupon. It's all about the coupon. We ordered the Chelada. Wow, pretty terrible. Leave the chelada making to a Mexican. Steak was actually not bad. Artichoke appetizer rocks. The waitress, who was twelve at the most, was the queen of the upsell, but she graciously gave us the birthday freebie cookie and ice cream. We left a good tip (20%, is that still considered good?). IMO, if you want a great steak, go to Firebirds."}
{"text":"The food and service is excellent. I had the teriyaki beef for lunch with a side of steak soup and broccoli and enjoyed every bite. I recommend this place for a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"We at there while waiting to hit the Apple Store in the mall. The food was good but not overly memorable, really just like any chain restaurant is what it reminded us of. The waitress was a server- not a good waitress at all. She asked if we wanted more bread and we did........ She never brought it. As we were getting ready to pay the check it took forever and then we asked for to go cups as we hadn't finished the lemonades ......... You guessed right.........by the time she finally brought the check back with no cups we left. 
Would not go there again"}
{"text":"Sad, just sad. my prime rib was 90% fat the atmosphere is just miserable for twenty dollars I could of got a better prime rib at the grocery store not happy! It was my birthday and I wanted a steak and all I got was a piece of fat."}
{"text":"I took my husband here yesterday because I got mailer coupon for a free lobster tail with the purchase of a steak.  My hub ordered the New York and I got the Teriyaki.  
1. The New York steak had so much fat on it and was grisly
2. The \"loaded baked potato\" was this tiny potato with about a teaspoon of sour cream and a few sprinkles of cheese, bacon and chives
3. The \"lobster tail' for both of us was this tiny medallion of lobster about 2inches around
4. The bread served was just a bigger single roll with less than a teaspoon of butter on the side
5. I used the pepper and the lid was not even screwed on and it poured all over my food and the table.  The waiter wasn't that concerned and said he'd check the other tables. What the heck?  Didn't offer to replace the food or help clean up the mess
6. We asked about Happy Hour and were told we HAD to sit at the bar. I guess we could have gone over and gotten drinks and come back.
Needles to say we won't be coming back.  It was a very disappointing experience.  
They need to bust up their game because if they don't -- they'll go by the way side because there are too many places that don't offer this much expensive disappointment.  The least the waiter could have done is offered 10% off our $60+ bill for the pepper incident.   Never again."}
{"text":"I have not been to Black Angus for several years. Tonight we participated in the San Tan Brewery event that was hosted at the Chandler Black Angus. It was amazing. This special event paired San Tan beer with each course of the four course meal. It was exceptional. From the appetizer to the dessert the food was awesome. I will definitely be returning and am so joyful that I participated in this special event. Kathy S. Tempe"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good except my salad wedge. I ordered balsamic vinegarette, but got some kind of atomic garlic dressing. I was so hungry that I just started wolfing it down before realizing I could kill vampires at 50 feet. I have suffered now ( my wife too) all weekend with laser breath and sour stomach.
Service was fine. I am sure that the salad would have been fixed if I had said something. The salad dressing was subtle, until later.
Next time I will be more careful."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite steakhouses. We usually get the fireside feast for 2. For once a steakhouse that asks how I want my steak cooked because they're actually going to cook it that way."}
{"text":"We had a very good waitress. It was a birthday dinner and she helped make it special. We had prime rib and lobster which they made sure were done just right!  I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago to this restaurant as we had heard from a couple of people that it was a good place to go to. Maybe we just went on a \"bad day\" because it wasn't that great. We went on a Friday evening and the place was nearly empty. Our drinks arrived pretty quick and our order was taken, but I noticed that other people had the \"loaf\" of bread We seriously asked about 4 different waiters where our bread was and they all said the same \"I'll get it for you right now\". They would walk off and 10 minutes later..nothing. Well we never got the bread and when our food finally arrived. It was bland, cold, and dry. We did order a dessert to split and that was actually the only good thing about the experience..."}
{"text":"my family and i came 30 minutes before they closed...but they still gave us great customer service! the food was brought out fast which is always a plus. our waitress was nice and had no problem with our request for sauces, utensils, napkins etc. it's a little on the pricey side but it's a steakhouse what to you expect?"}
{"text":"The 3 pieces of shrimp cocktail that came with the sampler platter were good & the twice baked potatoes were mostly dry but the rest of the ingredients on them  were good. My son's blackberry ginger ale was good it was 25oz for 2.99 where as regular sodas are 2.59 after tax she told me but I guess she forgot to tell me it does not come with refills like the regular soft drinks do. My son is 13 years & 11mths He gets a soda 2 times a month so yea it kinda pissed me off that I paid almost the same price for 1. The steak had ZERO seasoning, The artichoke appetizer was kinda bland the green sauce that came with it was nasty but the white one was ok, It must be noted my son loved the green sauce. We asked for extra butter & sour cream for both of our baked potatoes & as she turned around half way through our request she didnt hear the for both part & only brought 1 side each. At that point we were pretty pissed & just asked for to go boxes. They had a radio special going for the campfire combo which eliminated our ability to use our coupon for a free app. The waitress told us the blue cheese wedge salad was life-changing.... um no, not even a little bit. It was just  drowned in sauce. Over all Im so much happier to go to Outback Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Service was pretty decent but the portions were very small. We went for lunch. we would go back. 
 I ordered a side of french fries and when they came out there was maybe a 11 french fries on the plate you can see the plate through the fries. The dressings were not all that great salad sandwich was good. And our server she actually was really good."}
{"text":"My grandma loves Black Angus. More importantly, she loves this location. We've been coming here for Mother's Day the past few years at her request. It was a packed night! I believe she also goes a couple of other times throughout the year. 

Everyone who works here treats her sooooo well. (FYI, my grandma is one difficult woman to please at times, LOL.) She knows the manager and we had her favorite server last night. They even know her by name and I believe call her sometimes to see if she wants to make a reservation.. Manager even came outside as we were taking pictures to thank her. Great service! It truly makes her feel so special and she talks about Black Angus often lol. This is Esther's granddaughter :) 

They also have great deals on food. We all ordered appetizers and entrees which came with two sides each. So much food for a reasonable price and everything was so good! My mom loved the prime rib, I had top sirloin and that was also delicious. My favorite thing is the loaded baked potato.. Yummmm!!

Overall, it was nice to see my family and I love the atmosphere that Black Angus has. Even better when I have a happy & satisfied grandma. Thank you so much!! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and two of us ordered the grilled salmon and the other two ordered the grilled chicken.   One of the chicken order was slightly overcooked along with one salmon.    Justin, our server, was very attentive and help even after we accidently spilled one of our drinks.    The salad they served was huge and quite tasty.   Will return!"}
{"text":"While Black Angus may not be at the top of the food chain when it comes to steakhouses, the food at this location is consistently good every time that we come here.

The portions are huge and you can't beat the $39 campfire special coupon that comes out in every weeks paper or mailer insert.  Included in the special is:

One appitizer to share - Wagonwheel Sampler is the best deal by far and can easily share 4 ways no problem. 
Two entree selections: they are off a pre-fixe menu - however there are a couple steak options as well as fish and chicken. While the fillet isn't offered at the $39 price, you can have one for an additional $3. Finish it off with your choice of any dessert on their dessert list. 

I get the fillet every time and it has always been awesome. I also recommend the mushroom & onion add on as it is also quite delish. 

This is one of the chain restaurants that still accepts reservation and not just call ahead seating most offer now. 

The bottom line:

Great for groups and last minute dinner plans. Service is good, staff seems to be knowledgeable and the food is consistently the same quality wise."}
{"text":"We frequently go to the Black Angus for their great Happy Hour specials and delicious food! I love their prime rib.  We are always seated quickly and the servers are very attentive."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of mediocre which in this case is not necessary bad. You know that you need to go in with low expectations but your wallet won't be hurt.

Service is hit an miss but today I had a great waitress. Alex was awesome (and she's gorgeous, so it can't go any better service wise per my opinion).

I've tried several dishes and most of them are pretty decent.

So if you're driving around and nothing in the area sounds good to you, here you know what you're going to get. And if you're super lucky, you might have Alex as your waitress :)

Cheers"}
{"text":"Was very happy coming here. Didn't want much, just a drink and an order of potato skins. But the bartender Mike treated me great, made it a very fun relaxing experience. Left you alone if you wanted and engaged in friendly conversation the whole time if you wanted. Saw everyone around me with a smile because of this guy. Keep it up."}
{"text":"We had delicious potato skins for an appetizer, and then did the couples deal if two entrees for dinner. My steak was nice and juicy. We had the big mountain chocolate cake for dessert, which was sooooo good! This place is still great food after all these years. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have not been to Black Angus in about maybe 6 or 7 years. To be honest , I did not think they were even around any more. So I was surprised when I was over in Chandler at Mimi's & saw there was a Black Angus there.
A few nights later we came here for dinner. We came about 5:30pm. There were just a few tables in there dining. About 6 people in the Bar.
Our Hostess was really perky and sat us right away in a booth,with our menus. We waited so long to be greeted that we actually were ready to completely order by the time our Server came over. 
The menus are nice well laid out. However, The first thing I noticed was how high the prices all are. This is not the Black Angus I remember . I remember decent food at a good price.
Our server was not interested in waiting on us at all. As if she had better things to do. 
I promise, they were not busy in there at all.
With the Tip our bill was about $100.00,so I really thought for that kind of $$$ I would rather go to The Keg, or Somewhere with a nicer ambiance. 

The dishes were very plain, almost looked plastic. The Tables were not set high end at all.
The food was good! I really liked it. But, I thought it was priced too high.
If you look at my photos, the food is just put on this really plain dish. was not appealing at all.

We had to wait far too long for our bill as well. I don't know where our Server was because, I did not see her anywhere. I can honestly say we won't be back.
I did like the Ladies Room, it was decorated nicely with great old adverts that were framed. That was a plus!"}
{"text":"Came in here today after a horrific service/kitchen experience from Social Box on Alma School and Knox & David, the bartender made my day! Perfect, attentive service and actually got my food in few minutes which is more than I can say for Social Box. You can tell they actually care about their patrons here."}
{"text":"Poor and slow service. Salads came just before the dinners. Could have died from thirst in this place. Went to the bar my self to get a drink. They did comp deserts which was nice but you would think the manager would have stopped by. Never saw them. Really over priced for what you get. Last time I let a advertisement drag me in."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today and had an awesome experience. Staff was friendly, our waitress, I wish I could remember her name, was very attentive and polite and the food was great. So with that 5 stars..... 

Thanks Black Angus."}
{"text":"Scratch my prior review.  We went back because we had a gift card, just like in October when we thought it was way overpriced.  When I made the online reservation under \"Special Requests\" I wrote: A table please rather than a booth along the wall.  We were marched right past two or three tables and placed in a booth in the far back corner by the kitchen.  We ordered steak and lobster, mine medium and my husband's medium rare.  When served we weren't given, as normal, a plate for the lobster shells so we had to place them on our bread plate with the loaf of bread.  My husband's steak was barely pink and mine was well-well done.  Our bottle of Cab wine was served so warm I think it was stored in the kitchen next to the stove.  I actually had to put the remaining ice from my water glass in the wine.  YUCK!!  All this and we left with a tab like we'd have gotten in a fine restaurant in Scottsdale.  Never again - lesson learned."}
{"text":"Went to the bar at Black Angus to have some drinks and pubbish food for my birthday.  (remember when it was called Square Cow Fun Bar and there was all you can eat buffet?  Me neither - but my mother does).

Got three apps, six adult beverages for $30 - superfast service - also brought the warm bread (even though we didn't end up eating entrees).  Nice ambiance, squeaky clean, good prices and decent apps.  Will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Meh..  stopped by to grab a quick bite for dinner. Sat at the bar, and the service was average. The entire restaurant was getting orders filled at the bar, and that caused the bar service to suffer. I ordered a 14 OZ NY strip that was supposedly dry aged at least 29 days etc etc....it was average. About a step below Outback, and a step above Sizzler. The baked potato and salad, along with a coke cost about $32. I think that is way too high. To be fair, Arizona steaks are never really that great, even at the high end places in Scottsdale.  There were only about 2 -3 salads on the menu, no real healthy menu, and no specials. I am tired of all these chains claiming to be \"steak houses\"......far from it."}
{"text":"Food was good but service wasn't. We were sat in bar area which was busy so our waitress seemed frazzled. Took 4ever to get food & then when it came lobster was forgotten. Wasn't told no refills on strawberry lemonade & was nvr offered another drink till floor mngr advised no refills so asked 4 an ice tea & he refilled same glass with strawberries still floating in glass & it looked absolutely disgusting. Also asked 4 more bread but it never came."}
{"text":"This review is for the Nov 23, 2017 Thanksgiving Feast. I usually prepare our Thanksgiving meal myself but this year my adult daughter had just started chemotherapy and with all the running around we had been doing for all her tests and appointments, I just didn't feel up to the task. In addition to my daughter and myself, our party included my two grandsons, ages 11 and 8. Our waitress was Tamara who was very attentive despite being very busy. I was prepared for a mediocre meal of convenience but was pleasantly surprised at the quality. We all loved the molasses bread and asked for seconds. Price included a garden salad or soup as a starter. The dinner plates were filled with white and dark meat turkey over tasty dressing of perfect consistency, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes with gravy, broccoli and whole berry cranberry sauce. All except the latter was hot and very good. The pumpkin pie didn't compare to mine, but was certainly acceptable. Although the price for the boys' dinner was half that of an adult portion, they received generous amounts of everything. We all took leftovers enough for another meal and celebrated having no dishes to clean! I wouldn't hesitate having another holiday meal at this location."}
{"text":"My first visit was decent, but didn't quite live up to my expectations.

The food just wasn't that good for a steakhouse. Neither my wife and I cared for our appetizer. We got the Fire-Grilled Fresh Artichoke. They say it is a popular choice, but I didn't like it at all. My burger was very plain and lacked good taste. It made me wish I had gone to Five Guys instead. My wife got the steak and thought it was OK, but later she ended up getting sick. She ordered off the gluten-free menu as she has sensitivities, so this place may have issues with cross-contamination.

One positive was our friendly server. Cassie was excellent and we were very pleased because we rarely get good service when we go out. She kept up with refills and offered to replace anything we didn't like. I also wrote about my visit and explained how I didn't like the food. The manager said he would send us a coupon, so I can appreciate that they are reaching out to their customers.

I got good vibes from sitting at the restaurant. I like their tables and seats. I think I will give it a second chance, but the food has to be better if they want to win me over as a customer."}
{"text":"Average food for the prices you pay. But ¬°wow! the service is spectacular. The manager (Roger I think?) has always managed to make time to see us. The wait staff as well are incredibly friendly. The food gets to the table fast and the place has got a good vibe. Best thing on the menu is the Sky High Mud Pie."}
{"text":"The food is just ok... A little over priced compared to what you get. WIll choose a better steakhouse, at the same price point, before coming here again... very disappointed in quality, portion size, and price point."}
{"text":"We came to Black Angus for our anniversary dinner.  My husband and I called ahead just to make sure we didn't have to wait long.  We were seated fairly quickly but we did arrived after the rush for sure (7:30pm).  We sat down and immediately asked for our order.  We hadn't even opened the menu yet...   We asked for waters first followed by a glass of wine.  We decided on the Campfire feast which included an appetizer, 2 entrees with 2 sides for each entree and dessert.  We anticipated our steaks to come out a little more done than we ordered which was true when our steaks arrived.  I would go back however would make sure I have the coupon for reducing the Campfire feast from $58 to $43.  If we didn't have that I'd just make my way to Outback."}
{"text":"I want to say the service we got there tonight was actually really good. Normal service is more than a little slow. With that being said the food was less than okay. The steak was tough and even though they replaced it the second one wasn't much better, but the dogs will enjoy it. What really made me write this review is there were soooo many little bugs crawling and flying all over the place, it was quite unappetizing trying to eat and a bug crawling on the table or your arm. We've tried multiple times to give this location a chance and every time we leave asking \"why?\" So again nothing against our server tonight she was great, but everything else was less than okay. 
I guess if we go back to a Black Angus it will have to be to the Metro location"}
{"text":"Havent done a long review in a while, but this was needed. We haven't been back here for a little over a year. The only time we ever go is when my parents get a gift card for their birthdays because of the holiday deal where you buy a $100 dollar gift card and receive $20 extra coupon cards. We also had coupons from the mail that we used. We sat down ordered our drinks, I ordered the top sirloin with giant prawns, and my parents ordered the two for $42 with coupon (normally $52) that comes with an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert.

We sat there eating our free molasses bread, and then the appetizer came out, but wait where's our drinks? Our server had forgotten about them, we quickly flagged him down and reminded him then he promptly got the drinks for us. Shortly after our entrees arrived. Tasting my steak I felt it was under seasoned; I'm not sure how others eat their steaks but I generally don't add salt and steak sauce to mine. In this case I had to add salt to gift it that extra kick. When biting my first prawn it was definitely under cooked so I put it a side to take home. Eating the prawns next day as I'm writting this reveiew they were delicious, just had to cook them a bit more. My dad complained about his baked potatoe was not rightand my mom said her chicken was over cooked and dry. This is the most inconsistent cooking I've seen in a long time at any establishment.

Finally, we ordered the giant cookie with vanilla ice cream to finish off my parents two for $42, but by then we were full so we had our waiter pack the cookie to go and eat the ice cream there. He ended up packing both up and handed us the bill. We handed him the gift card and coupons to process and also asked for some spoons to eat the ice cream. He came back with just the bill...this guy I swear...his mind was somewhere else that night. The one plus was since he had forgotten about our drinks; he took them off our bill. Overall, I don't think I would come back here and spend my own money for dinner."}
{"text":"Never can go wrong at the Metro Black Angus.  They are courteous and if you don't like they make good.   Outstanding staff and managerial staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"At the Black Angus steakhouse our party of eight received the worst service I have experienced in quite some time. We had a 5:30 reservation on a Saturday night. Our server did not take our order until after 6:30. She kept walking by and promising to return, she commented she was dealing with a difficult table. We would have gotten up and left but we were celebrating birthdays. We did not want to go to another restaurant and wait another hour to get a table or order our dinner. I did speak with the manager after dinner who apologized. We eat out often, we will not return to this restaurant. We will spend our dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious food, tasty steak done to our liking, crispy shrimp. The new strawberry mojito was great and our server Kelsey was attentive and full of positive personality.  We never felt rushed to finish our meal to turn the table over.  Food was served at a nice pace. One star less only due to ladies bathroom being out of hand soap. After advising hostesses, later found only one of the two soap dispensers were filled."}
{"text":"We went to Black Angus in Glendale tonight & it was great! We had the steak quesadilla appetizer, entrees: grilled salmon & ribeye, & mud pie for dessert..everything honestly was wonderful! But what put it over the top was our server Travis. So kind, helpful & friendly. They are lucky to have him! Black Angus does reservations. I recommend asking for Travis. I know we will the next time & we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really don't like having to write a bad review, because it means (in this case) that I spent my money to be stressed out.  The waiter was in a world of his own, forgetting one thing after another.  When I spoke to the manager as I was leaving, his alibi was that the waiter is new.  Then the manager told me that he is also new.

So a new waiter was put on the floor without proper training ... overseen by a new manager.  This isn't Jack In The Box.  It's a steak house.  I've lived in the Valley for 39 years and have been here many times.  But there are other steak houses and I won't return to Blank Angus again.

Neither the manager nor the wait staff seems to know that alibis aren't the end of the story.  They should be the beginning.  Nothing can be expected to change with that attitude.  I didn't even get an \"I'm sorry\".

It is a shame!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner with family and friends for my birthday, my nieces artichoke duo had a long black hair in it and her steak was cooked med rare on one side and well done on the other, my prime rib was dry and had a crust from sitting. Had to go to the bathroom had to go quickly didn't look at the floor my shorts hit the floor when I pulled them up they were wet I was so upset ... what a horrible experience $30+ dollars for food I didn't eat and nasty facilities very disappointed"}
{"text":"Black Angus in Chandler is ok, I did see some patrons dressed like bums. The prices were really high too almost $120 for two people. I wouldnt recommend it for the price,"}
{"text":"The food here is really good! And they give decent portion sizes for the price. We were seated right away and our waitress was extremely good. She would constantly check on us and made sure everything was to our liking. Nothing to complain about here!"}
{"text":"Went here for valentine's dinner the first nice one without our kids.  We were seated within 10 minutes which was nice but that is where it ended.  Took a while to get service ordered then waited a while for the food, the food well Texas Roadhouse is better, the steaks had no seasoning had to send one back to be cooked more , the baked potato was under cooked and the brussel sprouts did not even taste cooked.  The waiter kept forgetting things.  They ran out of prime rib and take out containers.  I think we will not be going back. For the money we paid it was not worth it we should have just stayed home but I wanted a nice one since our kids have grown up."}
{"text":"A decent place. Good food. Great value with a coupon. Service is less than stellar as the place is always packed. Wait staff mainly mechanical. Make a reservation ahead of time during peak season. Prime rib was quite good. Good once or twice a month."}
{"text":"Good meal and service. The filet was good, salmon excellent and, better yet, all the extras were exceptional."}
{"text":"First time ever trying this chain.  Finally.  
Lovely steak.  Great chicken avocado sandwich.  Service was great especially when I explain my needs for being I weight loss patient and having the need for smaller portion sizes.  Black Angus was very accommodating which is hard to come by these days.

The fries were not shoestring nor were they steak fries..... they were right in the middle and they were so exquisite.."}
{"text":"Mixed thoughts about coming here based on some mixed reviews. But this will def be one of our go to places every year we come back. For $35 o got a 6 oz filet and just about the best king crab legs I've ever had. They were fantastic!  And for the price you can't beat what I got. Also loved their homemade blueberry ginger ale!  
Huge menu, very friendly service, and def a local favorite for is now. Thanks and GO REDS!!!"}
{"text":"Have been a loyal Black Angus customer for over 20 years. Our visit today was a huge disappointment. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because our waitress was so nice. I ordered the 12 oz Ribeye Pink. When it arrived at my table it was as flat as the thin breakfast steaks you see in the grocery store was was as well done as can be. Cutting through it was like leather. The waitress kindly offered a replacement which wasn't much better. I took 2 bites and brought the rest home as microwaving it tomorrow won't hurt the quality of this steak. My husband ordered the Porterhouse Pork Chop which was tiny and his Mac and Cheese was like cheese soup with noodles in it. The bill for my husband and I was over $80.00 and to be honest I would have been happier walking across the street for a BigMac at McDonalds. Below is a picture of the 12 oz paper thin well done Ribeye. Thank goodness our waitress was so nice or else one star would have been a reach."}
{"text":"I wish I could actually rate the food,  but we didn't get the chance to order.   We read the whole menu,  chatted a while,  griped that nobody had come to our table yet and still nobody had even said hi to us.   The hostess was nice,  but that's not enough to give 2 stars to a business that CLEARLY doesn't want our business.   

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"With a name BLACK ANGUS, you expect a *quality* steak, right? Not!! More like Ponderosa or Sizzler with Outback prices. The restaurant was clean, but outdated. Our server was sweet, and that's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars!! 

Never again."}
{"text":"I had the new chili rubbed New York strip and I honestly expected more for a steak worth 27$"}
{"text":"Super disappointed! My friend's birthday and I have ordered a Rib eye steak, when the server bring out the steak, I wasnt really aware what steak I have got, since we are in the middle of a conversation. When I was digging in 1/3 of the steak, and I start questioning my self did I ordered a New York strip or Rib eye. I asked the server I did I order, and he told me Rib eye, and I asked him do you think this is Rib eye or New York steak? He was new and said he dont have experience, and need to ask the chef. When he came out he told me Rib eye have bone, and New York Strip dont. I have Rib Eye at black Angus couple times and never had a bone in Rib eye..... I will never go back ! be careful guys, they are no honest! DC steak house is better !"}
{"text":"Great steaks, and seafood.... They have the best teriyaki sauce for steak or chicken.... 
my husbands favorite steak house"}
{"text":"New Manager is amazing.  Very professional, engaging, up beat and friendly.   Service and food was amazing today.   We haven't been here since January, so glad we stopped in today.  If you guys had a bad experience on your previous visit.  You have to try this place again."}
{"text":"Had a large group, service was great. Food was spot on, good stuff, chef had prepared everything perfect. I have been coming to this location for over 15 years and can say I don't ever remember having a bad experience."}
{"text":"They have large wrap around booths that can accommodate a lot of people. They have a wide and open space so it feels really spacious.

Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. He told us that the chef has been here for over 20 years, which tells me that the staff really enjoy working here. 

I tried the veggie salad which was amazing. On top of a bed of lettuce comes asparagus, goat cheese, grilled opinions, mushrooms and tomatoes. It was so nicely seasoned with a zesty dressing.

They also have an excellent dessert list!"}
{"text":"OK! I find it expensive for a steak house. We had a gift card and hope to not have another. They overcooked my wife's steak. I had too much fat on the prime rib. Franchise is slipping. Closed 4 places in Northern CA where my $10 extra gift card expired before i could find another place to use."}
{"text":"We went for Thanksgiving since no one wanted to cook. All the food was good, service was extremely slow and they weren't busy enough for it to be as slow as it was. Service was good, kept our drinks full. I had prime rib, cooked great, but no any kind of seasoning or spices. The french fries were not good at all, tasted old. The soup was amazing, best part of the meal! Everyone else in our party said same thing, it was ok."}
{"text":"My very first visit to Black Angus and a love love relationship definitely began. Not only was my steak WONDERFUL tasting, it was cooked to order and served with panache! I had the cowboy ribeye. Sheesh, the thing was huge! Larger than advertised I'm betting. Anyway, our waiter was attentive without driving us nuts, the manager was the one to drop by when it was dessert time, dare I tell you we had dessert then took two home? Well we did and took enuf food home to have two more meals!
If you like steak you have GOT to give Black Angus a try, personally I can't wait for my next visit, I'm having their world famous ribs!"}
{"text":"Went in on Tuesday night with my family and I had a pretty good experience. I ordered the chicken fingers (I don't like steak) and they were good! My husband got the filet mignon sandwich and he said it was great. It was ok for the price I suppose. Our server was super accommodating and friendly!  The manager also came to our table and asked how everything was and I was happy to see that. The only complaint I have is the pushy-ness of the paper to sign up for the email club or whatever. I'm pretty sure we were asked 3 times to fill those out. She even said \"the manager was on her case about them\" which yeah I get. I worked in retail and had to get customers to sign up for stuff but I never was allowed to say that or ask multiple times. That's the only thing that I felt was odd and unprofessional."}
{"text":"We went to this same restaurant when in AZ last year and had a fantastic meal.  Since then we went back twice and tonight took visiting family there because they remembered it from last year and wanted to return. Sadly, we were all disappointed. 

On Valentines Day I actually had to send my steak back when I cut through some gristle in my filet mignon. The broccoli was over cooked. Tonight my top sirloin was tough and undercooked. I considered sending it back but by the time I saw the waiter again I was about done with my meal. The waiter forgot to bring our mushrooms. We got one small loaf of bread for 5 people and had to ask for a second loaf.  

We'll be looking for a new steakhouse for next year."}
{"text":"Let's say 3.5 stars rounded up. Went here with my mom for her birthday because she suggested it and we had a coupon. Had an appetizer sampler to share, prime rib (for me) with onion rings and grilled asparagus, \"ribeye\" (for mom) with Caesar salad and broccoli. The pro's: very personable staff, attentive service, flavorful food. The meat was well seasoned and cooked to the correct doneness that we asked for. Also The ranch sauce for the fried zucchini was really good. Lighter than what you get at most places. The place was quiet, casual atmosphere which I prefer over a loud and rowdy place. The cons: mom ordered ribeye but what came out on the plate was clearly a New York, but she liked it so a big deal was not made of it and we weren't over charged. Fried items on the sampler were on the greasy side. All in all it was a good meal with good service. I say 3.5 stars because I know I can get food and service just as good elsewhere for less money (ie. Texas Roadhouse) and would only come back with a groupon or special deal."}
{"text":"Their coupons dinner for two could feed 3-4 people. Other than using a coupon for this restaurant, nothing really luring me here. I live nearby, so when I crave for prime rib, my first thought would be Texas Roadhouse but it's too far for instant gratification.  They do not have good salad nor appetizer, the shrimp cocktail is ridiculously small (3?). The side kicks aren't appealing. Maybe I'm just too damn picky on how to spend $50."}
{"text":"Just not a good experience. Waited a long time for our food and the service was lackluster. 

Seriously - the leadership seems to be the issue here. The people working here seem capable and I'm sure they can do more and do it better. They just don't have the inspiration to make the experience better, faster and enjoyable. 

We tried it and won't be back. There are better places within 1/2 mile for the same fare with a better delivery and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Sarah O. Was the best server I've had in long time. The food was great, especially with my bday coupon. 35.00 w tip included an appetizer, 2 prime rib dinners with sides, and a huge chocolate chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream. The meat had quit a bit of fat, but that's my only complaint. Otherwise, we left stuffed to the gills. Even had to take home half my prime rib!"}
{"text":"This visit was odd.
We have not been to a black Angus in yrs, and never to this location.
The drinks were good. Tasty blackberry mojito, and a peach mule.
The salad greens were fresh and not just plain ol' iceberg.
The baked potato was so loaded and full! 
My filet at 1st was overdone so they refired it.
The second time it came out very rare.
The manager took it back and seared it off for a couple min. It came back a perfect medium. It was delicious! Melt in your mouth tender.
The manager was so accommodating, he even surprised us with a free dessert. We tried the mudpie. It was very good, minus the almonds...could have lived without that part."}
{"text":"Great dinner menu and drinks.  I had the Salmon which was great and my Brother had Prime rib that did not stay long on his plate. Surprised to see this restaurant as most have gone into bankruptcy."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. We have been going to this location for the last 4 years. But this year was the worst experience we have encountered. The appetizer was cold all the way through. When our main course came out the prime rib was barely warm. And had 90% fat on it. I had to continually ask for my baked potato that was supposed to come with my meal. After everything was said and done. I asked to see a manger about the issue with our meal and all he offered is a second dessert. Sorry but for $70 for 2 meals. I expect that food to be done right. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Customers were early on a Sunday. Were was nice to let wait inside but after 10 minutes after opening time were seated. Waiter was polite and friendly. Problem was that my New York steak was so tough it was inedible. When i informed waiter he apologized and said he was so sorry. Told him my dog could could chew it and would take it to him. He said ok. 80 dollars for 2   Never go back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Wife order Cobb salad. I order prime rib open face sandwich. Slow but food finally came. Wife looked salad and said no eggs or avocados  waiter said they were out. I could not cut prime rib with steak knife  did bring another. Worse than first. Left hungry"}
{"text":"Their steaks are a weee-bit salty for me but pretty tasty nonetheless.  Good food, nice ambiance and decent service.  Not much to complain about!"}
{"text":"For a Sunday evening dinner, the inexpensive \"Fireside for 2\" served us well.  We decided to try the newest addition to the appetizer family, the sweet and sour cauliflower and of course the traditional molasses bread.   To our surprise, the cauliflower arrived coated and deep fried.  It was hot and tasty.  My prime rib was tender but less compelling than this cut at other places but hey, the price was right in line for the quality of meat.    We decided on the \"Big mountain fudge cake\" for dessert, which was a tad dry but the vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate syrup remedied this issue. Our server was spot on polite and efficient with offering to refill our water and wine glasses.  In a nutshell, I believe you get what you pay for and this meal for two with their coupon cost $45.00."}
{"text":"I brought my girlfriend to dinner to celebrate her passing her real estate license exam. We both ordered the $39.99 bone in ribeye with a free lobster tail coupon from Wednesdays coupons. Our steak was marginal at best and for almost $40, what a ripoff!!! We could have gone to Arrowhead Grill for that price!! Then lets talk about the POS lobster tail. They were both a dried piece of leather! Disgusting. The best parts of our $120 dinner were the bread and salads. STAY AWAY IF YOU WANT A GOOD STEAK DINNER!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely dinner tonight for our 9 year anniversary. This is definitely my top choice for a nice steak dinner. You can't beat their campfire feast for 2 meal and we got a coupon in the mail just about a week ago so we've been looking forward to our dinner date to celebrate. The wait was a little longer than quoted and we hadn't made reservations being that it's a Wednesday night, but it happens. Our waitress Hannah, was quick to greet us and was so pleasant. She just had the sweetest smile and positive energy. Appetizer was unbelievable (nachos), the steaks were so tender and juicy and the bread was so fresh. Seriously like it just came out of the oven. We were so full we didn't even eat our dessert, we took it to go for later. The food was all around delicious but Hannah really made the dinner date so much more enjoyable with her friendly demeanor, probably the best waitress I've ever had! Thank you for a wonderful setting and meal for our dinner date this evening. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Go to Frys. Buy some steak. Cook at home. You'll get better food than at this place. Steaks are not top quality and service was HORRIFIC! Stay away."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and always receive great service. This last time took a lot longer than usual, but our food was made fresh and perfectly so the wait was worth it.

I usually get the ribeye or chicken, but decided to try the salmon this time.  It was perfect!  Deliciously flavored, a generous portion, and fresh from the grill.  Hubby had a steak and our little one shared with us.  We had mac and cheese, salad, baked potato, and Mashed potatoes for the sides.  Wagon wheel appetizer and bread pudding dessert. 

Absolutely no complaints.  Will return soon, waiting to see if the 7% cash back is legit.

Bathrooms have always been clean and were still clean this time around."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I went to Black Angus to use our gift certificate my father gave to us over the holidays. A background - I have only been here for lunch and took to go, my husband has never been here. So we should have realized when we got there that this may not be a good idea when there is hardly ANYONE in the place. So we sat down... The atmosphere was a little dated and no real propaganda on the tables which I though was weird. It almost made the place feel like it was closing its doors soon. So we ordered... App was their fried zucchini which was amazing. I also ordered the bacon wrapped filet mignon (medium well) and my husband ordered a ribeye (medium rare). When our order came out, the presentation lacked that of a $30 plate of food. I honestly felt like I was at Dennys. My filet was bleeding and waaaay under cooked. My husband was way over cooked. His piece looked like some tri tips where pushed together surrounded by some fat. It was not appealing at all. So we sent our steaks back. The waitress was nice but not over the moon trying to help. We got our food again... and now my piece was over cooked and my husband received a new piece that looked like it was ran over by a freight train. So I began to naw away at my meat. As sides, the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese- worth NOT getting. I took a bite of each and that was it. Honestly tasted like soap and I have no idea why. I asked for a refill of my strawberry lemonade since my empty glass was sitting there for so long however there are NO refills on lemonade (weird). So i got a water... Then time passed she came back with a lemonade (as we almost were wrapping up) and said here you go for all of your problems tonight. It was just weird and awkward. Our bill was still $65 as we left and I am thankful it didn't come out of our pocket. If you are craving steak, I would recommend heading somewhere else."}
{"text":"Recently went there to celebrate my boyfriends birthday with his family and everything started out great.  The drinks were good and our server K.C. was very pleasant and entertaining.  But our food took forever, not sure why when the restaurant did not look too busy.  Once we finally got our food we enjoyed it.  Although my steak was pretty overcooked, I kept my mouth shut and ate it anyways."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised by the reviews and wished I would have read them before going.  What I am surprised about is how many negative reviews there are going back several years and the same problems remain...hello?

This was our first and last visit.  There's no \"Steak House\" apeal at all.  It more resembles a nursing home.  Not only the cliental but the decor as well.  Even when the phone rings, it seems to be amplified so everyone has an opportunity to hear it.  Management seemed very out of touch not only with the guests but the employees as well.  

The portions on the sides were very small and the 16 oz Ribeye I had ordered medium rare...half, yes half of the steak they praise was medium well and the other half was RARE, very very rare.  They forgot to bring out my mashed potatoes and once they did after I said something they were very dry.  Everything I had lacked flavor and care.  I could go on about the other 3 dishes my family had and didn't care for, however I really want to put this behind us. 

Once a week my family and I try something new...we will not be back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you want steak, and you want better than Sizzler, but don't want to shell out the big bucks for Durant's or some such either. That's where Black Angus fits the bill. Two adults can get a decent slab of beef with all the sides, and your kid can get a meal too, for well under a bill. 

The staff here is always very smiley and nice, and we've never had much of a wait. Though we usually go at \"off\" times. We barely  beat the grey tide on Sunday, by arriving around 4pm.

The decor is mellow and somewhat dim. The booths are freakishly tall, forming a comfy little cocoon to eat in. The piped in music isn't too horrible either -- usually consisting of some mellow 80s tunes and chill 90s rock."}
{"text":"Think twice. This place is really mediocre   Steak is probably select grade;without marbeling meat is very chewy"}
{"text":"My wife and 3 kids love this restaurant for a few reasons. The first that comes to mind is the atmosphere and general mood of the staff. Jason the manager very welcoming and genuinely friendly both to us*my wife and I* and our children. Our server Sam was energetic and attentive to our needs and request. After ordering we got our food in a timely manner while also being fully satisfied with the meal outcome. This brings me to the next point, the food. It is divine, my top sirloin cooked to utter perfection not to mention the salads with their homemade dressing and to top it off the broccoli they serve needs to be packaged and sent to my home on a weekly basis. The food here is by far the best tasting, thank you chef, and looking then I've seen over the last 17yrs of dining. So a huge thank you to this place and it's staff for an amazing and delightful experience."}
{"text":"So I'm mixed on this one. Our first experience was Valentine's Day. We called and were told it would be 3 hours for a reservation and they don't do call ahead so just to come. We get there and there's 1.5 hr wait. Since it took us 45 min to get there, they could have saved us 45 min by putting our name down when we called. We left. Second time was 20 min wait and as we sit there waiting, all these people keep coming in and getting seated immediately because they had called ahead. Either you do call ahead or you don't, but don't lie to me. The food was good but it's expensive. Our service wasn't great. If I spend $80 on a meal for 2 I want good service, which we didn't get. I have it 3 stars for the food, but will change my review if the service isn't good again next time. We'll see. It's worth a try but I recommend calling ahead, as apparently they do take call ahead seating. Or not. I don't know, maybe it depends on who answers the phone?"}
{"text":"was pretty disappointed as I was taking a friend here for his birthday. His food came out not cooked to order and the price for the quality just doesn't match up. The server took her sweet time with checking on us and giving us our bill. They were NOT busy either , very disappointing. I know it sounds petty but RESTROOMS are something I notice when im paying $70+ for 2 ppls meals, and they were by far up to par. I have seen fast food paces with cleaner restrooms. Will not be back"}
{"text":"My dads birthday was Saturday and he decided on having his bday lunch here. We arrived around 2pm and we were a party of 8.

The hostess greets us and tells us it would be a few minutes for her to set up the table. We wait and then she takes us back. Our server was already waiting at our table and we noticed that nothing had been done to them to accommodate our big group. The two tables were still separated down the middle and we were supposed to split up. (Four on each side) 

I tell him no that we would like to sit together. He says \"okay\" and so we actually help him move the tables together.. He takes our drink orders and and brings them out right away. 

We tell him we are ready to order and so he writes the orders all down..

Salmon with a loaded potato soup and green beans

Grilled chicken breast w a potato soup and mashed potatoes 

Two orders of Tri tip steak with loaded baked potatos and french fries

Two orders of pork chops with broccoli and green beans

Two orders of a rib eye steak (one with rice and potatoes and the other was a salad and baked potato)

Kids cheeseburger sliders. Kids meal comes with a scoop of ice cream!

Our server was very friendly and attentive throughout! For being a big group, he made sure to always keep our drinks refilled and made sure we were doing okay. 

My sister n law actually found a long piece of hair deep into her salad. She told the server right away and he kindly brought us out a new one. Other then finding that long hair, the food was great. 

The cookie my Dad was given for his bday was SO good! Sign up for their rewards club as you can get yourself a free meal (valued up to $21 I believe) for your birthday! 

We spent about $150 but it was well worth it. The food is usually always good and the service was great as well. 

Three stars because seeing that hair was gross."}
{"text":"First visit 9/9/14 aprox 5:30pm. The place was almost empty. We both ordered steak, thirteen minutes from order to delivery on table. Everything was cooked properly, to order. Service was good but slightly pushy.

Some advice for Black Angus wait staff:

As always, keeping my water glass from being empty and not assuming that we've come to your restaurant to make friends with wait staff are keys to a larger tip. Lastly, I am not an eating machine so wasting my time pushing appetizers and dessert always lowers the tip. We've come to your restaurant to eat, converse, and have a nice time without intrusions, more interruptions do not equal better service, especially when the place is practically empty and staff are easy to alert. When you come to my table to check on our satisfaction with the food interrupting us, forcing us to speak with a mouth full of food is embarassing."}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited here to fill a meat craving, we each wanted an 8 oz steak so our options were pretty limited. I got the top sirloin, she got the tri tip. We both ordered mushrooms on top (additional $2.50) and baked potatoes. We also ordered a Mai Tai and an orange margarita. When our meals came my daughter's steak had three pieces of mushrooms, mine had at least 20. Her plate had a baked potato, mine had about a teaspoon of something like mashed potatoes that appeared to have fallen from someone else's plate ( I hope before they ate from it). Then we tasted our drinks and both made a face, the waitress had switched our drinks! We complained about the lack of mushrooms and potato and mentioned the mystery substance. The waitress was not very apologetic but did bring more mushrooms and my potato. The sirloin was OK but the tri tip was extremely tough. We topped this off with some OK chocolate cake for dessert. While our meal wasn't terrible, it wasn't up to par for $77. I will probably take my meat craving elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Friday for lunch. We sat down at 1:30 and didn't get our food till 2:15.  For a rare steak that wasn't rare enough and for a chicken breast- thats too long. Our waitress Carlee was the bright spot of our lunch. Don't think we'll be back which is too bad because this place used to be amazing"}
{"text":"30 min waiting and still waiting,  and no silverware....the waitress said they ran out.   Seriously,  that's a first, and will be the last."}
{"text":"For what it is... Affordable steakhouse where you can have a conversation.  Look for a coupon to make it even more affordable.  My wife and I like to go here with friends when someone wants a steak and we all want a non-rushed atmosphere.   There is a full bar, but the service can be spotty.  This time the service was spot on.  Be sure to make a reservation on the weekend.

The ribs and chicken dinner also came with two side kicks.  The chicken is skinless, boneless and flat.  The Caesar salad was above average and the ribs and onion rings were good."}
{"text":"Had the steak and shrimp to go.  While at the bar they brought me additional bread and butter for while I was waiting.  The service was reasonably fast.  The steak was perfectly cooked.  It wasn't tough and stringy like the one I had gotten from Outback.  The baked potato was a bit over cooked and they never give you enough sour cream.  Best steak I've had in Mesa so far."}
{"text":"This is the second time to this locale. Ambiance is fairly descent with the high back booths offering privacy. Appetizers were really good, zucchini and cheese bread. The Rib eye steak was tasty however, still too much fat on the meat,  disproportionately too much if I have to cut off 20% for fat. The waitress was initially slow to serve and keep the glasses full
Which should not have been a huge tasks with only 3 tables to wait on. Also, the place charges for refills. Paid more for food and service than it was worth."}
{"text":"It'd been five or six years since visiting here. I'm sure that was pre-yelp era. We stopped in early around 4:00 and there was actually quite a few patrons there. We was promptly greeted and seated and drinks were brought right out along with the delicious bread. The wife ordered sirloin steak, salad and green beans. I had the ribeye, salad and au gratin potatoes. The waitress asked us to cut the meat to make sure it was cold as ordered. I had to send mine back as it wasn't done enough for my medium well liking. The manager brought it back out and awaited my approval. Perfect!!
Everything was excellent. We will return and hopefully it won't be on another 5-6 years."}
{"text":"This is my third time here in a few weeks, and have always enjoyed the filet mignon. It is usually perfectly prepared. Sat in the bar area (not very busy) this time and ordered the filet mignon again, however this time it had a lot of fat and gristle in it. I was initially disappointed with that as a filet mignon is supposed to be a lean and better cut and you certainly pay extra for filet mignon. After my feedback, the manager offered the replace it right away, which is definitely great service in my book!  I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"The worst steak I have ever eaten. Applebees has better steak. This place was absolutely terrible. The prices are extremely ridiculous for what you get. Go out of business already."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us from a friend who used to live in the area. Let's just say we weren't disappointed! The food was excellent! From our appetizers to our steaks and finally the desserts. The crown jewel of our experience was the steaks. Cooked to perfection! A must have. The service was great as well. I highly recommend checking this place out when in the area."}
{"text":"My friend & I celebrated my birthday tonight at Black Angus on Chandler Blvd.

The potato soup and shrimp cocktail were so yummy...

Brandon - our server- made my birthday special with his super service,
friendly personality and his strawberry shortcake surprise with a candle.

Very pleasant dinner"}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is great, but they've raised their prices so high you might as well go to Fleming's!!"}
{"text":"Madilynn was great at the bar , super smile, made us feel comfortable and welcome as soon as we came in.  We have been receiving some marketing lately and glad we decided to come in 3 times in the last 10 days and honestly haven't been in here for several years. Very clean, great beer selection, 12 to choose from, several local craft beers. Michael is the manager, he actually has followed up with us on every visit. Food served quickly and was as good as the pictures...Well done, come try them if it's been awhile..."}
{"text":"I heard from the manager Shawn, shortly after my first reply.  Very genuine guy whom you can tell truly cares about your experience at his restaurant.  I also felt our concerns were listened too, and would be addressed.  Shawn, has made everything right with us and we will return.  I truly believe sometimes things happen, it is how you handle the oops really matters. Shawn hit a home run with us!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night for an early dinner. I had been out of town for several days so wanted to spend some qt with him and eat a real meal.

I love Black Angus for their booths. Not sure why, but I am always seated in the booth in the back corner. Maybe I look like trouble?

We sat down and the table was set but clearly not wiped down. The hostess said she would clean it and it took a while but it got done.

The waitress came and tried to take our drink and food order with in moments of sitting down. Throughout the night she seemed to be rushing us along but it was evident she was new to the restaurant and likely the position. 

My hubby asked if they had the Sam Adams summer ale and she had no idea what he was asking. She asked him if that was different then the lager. Yikes!

She got the manager who was friendly and knew what beer they had. The waitress ended up being really fun and we are laid back so we enjoyed ourselves. There were a few issues that could have ruined the night but the manager  addressed them quickly with humor.

The low points: dirty table, waitress who needs knowledge of product and a Cesar salad that tasted like wet lettuce.

The high points: Awesome steaks (N.Y. and Ribeye)and sides , great atmosphere and a manager who was able to address issues appropriately."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in years so we thought we would try it. I will say the service was excellent! But that was about it. The food was pretty mediocre . Shrimp tasted like it was cooked in old oil and mashed potatoes were flavorless . For the price you're better off going to Outback"}
{"text":"Had a coupon for my birthday.  Dinner was so good. Lamb chops salad and dessert.  Thank you for my birthday gift.   We will be back.  Our waitress was awesome,  her name wasRachel she was on the ball and took very good care of us.  Thank you Rachel."}
{"text":"Party of 19 at 530p on a Wednesday evening celebrating a graduation received pleasant welcome and two server assistance throughout the evening. Service was  slow to get started and everyone was quite hungry. It seemed food orders were moving at a turtles pace. Including our party of 19, the restaurant could not have had more than 15 other diners; so perhaps our table could have had at least one more server. Our servers were friendly, and engaging, but perhaps a little overwhelmed. Once drinks orders were taken, it took so long before food orders got going. Warm bread was constantly being brought to the table which is a plus, but we were ready for FOOD.
We decided to order appetizers, although no one initially really wanted appetizer due to not wanting to spoil our appetites for 8, 12, & 16oz steaks with all the trimmings. Well after being so famished, eating bread, sipping drinks of mixed liquor & sodas & lemon water; we reluctantly but readily ordered four cheese bread sticks, buffalo wings, chicken tenders, steak quesadillas, potatoes skins and various other appetizers for the table to share in. I personally enjoyed all I tasted. The meal salads were delivered shortly thereafter; and as predicted, by the time entrees were ready and being delivered to the table, it was a bit past 720pm most of our party was restless and had taken leave from the table to  stretch their legs outside. My 10oz New York Strip with caramelized mushrooms & onions was a tad dry and not as tender as I'd like, but the portion that I tasted before getting a To-Go container, was seasoned well & was tasty enough. All in all, the food was ok. The service was fun and friendly and made the wait not worth bitching about. The persons in the party near me, seemed to enjoy their food. My husband who is a picky eater, has had a salmon dish and he wasn't doing his usual complaining about his dish not being prepared correctly, and he finished it, so that means it was a hit! My nephew had a 10oz Ribeye that he said was juicy and cooked to perfection. He enjoyed his loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli side. I'd say we would give Black Angus a thumbs up and recommend them as stop in town for good eats in casual dining."}
{"text":"I moved to the area 4 years ago and after eating at many places and being sick a few times...(I have a picky stomach) I only go here now. I'm a prime rib and filet eater and no place anywhere from east coast to here gives me such a pleasant dining experience. The food is great. ALL the staff are friendly and the manager is especially nice. Remembers us every time we come in. No where have I had this kind of experience. Having been a commercial pilot-I have eaten just about everywhere. I don't know why anyone but a total snob would draw a negative response from the staff. You get back what you give out...  They are generous and go out of their way to please you. I encourage all my friends to go there and they also have been pleased. I've never heard a negative word. If you can't enjoy this wonderful restaurant....you were raised in a barn and need to stay home. Outback, Longhorn... Can't hold a candle compared to Black Angus. I drive 8 miles past 4 other steak houses to go here. It's a happy place. I'm not a drunk so this is a sober review. I have a glass of wine with the best dinner ever. I can only imagine negative reviews come from drunks at the bar. I feel sorry for the servers who have to deal with those people. I've seen those patrons. Sad. So...if you want a nice quiet wonderful dinner...biggest desserts ever (takes 2 people to eat one) go here. It's absolutely wonderful. If you want to go get drunk...go to a bar in the desert. Jeez . Right now the Lamb and Key Lime pie is to die for!!!! Enjoy THIS IS A GREAT PLACE!"}
{"text":"Went here sat 5/13 for Mothers Day dinner.  There were 8 of us and our total bill was near $300.  I wish I could give no stars as the food was less than sub par.  The waiter however was very sweet and attentive.  This place is no longer a high quality steak house but still charging like they are.  Save your money and go elsewhere.  Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to the Black Angus on the east side (mesa I think) and it was terrible!! The service, the food, all of it. We swore we would never go back! Boy, am I glad we did we came to this location and had a vampire feast with a coupon might I add and it was unbelievable! The bread alone I could have made a meal out of, the steaks were perfect, and the service outstanding.... Thank you Black Angus on the west side!!!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. I mentioned to the waitress that's my sons steak was undercooked and all she said was that's the way steak is suppose to be eaten. Will never and I mean never go back ! Spend your money somewhere else .. it's a shame that the only good thing about this location is the name ."}
{"text":"Lovely meal at Black Angus! My husband had a birthday email that invited him to buy one steak entree and get one free. Our server was friendly and warm and so was the hot black bread with butter. I love the texture of the oats sprinkled on top. I think we shared three loves between the two of us.

Our house salads were fresh and crisp. They were generous with the light and dark bread croutons with mine, but hubby had to ask for more croutons. They make all their dressings in-house except for the Caesar Salad dressing. I loved my thick and creamy Ranch.

Hubby and I both ordered ribeye steaks medium-rare. The steaks were done to perfections with just the right amount of grill on the outside, pink and then a tinge of red. Because of the marbling of my steak, it melted in my mouth. My loaded baked potato was on the small side. It was the size of my child's fist. When I asked the server, she said that was the standard size. They were a little skimpy on the bacon, chives and cheddar as well.

Hubby's garlic butter on top of his ribeye was tasty, but as good as the cut of the steak was, I thought it detracted a little from the tasty meat. He had the tator tots which were okay.

They surprised us with a Cowboy Cookie a la mode. Wow! That was a big chocolate chip cookie, all warm and gooey baked in a metal pan. It came with a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum! Thank you, Black Angus."}
{"text":"First first of all when you walk in the place looks dirty it smells like old shoes but we had a coupon so oh well my mistake I asked for medium well steak when it came it was overcooked almost burnt and everything else was horrible I don't know why they're still open coupon or not I will not go back there and the prime rib that you get with the coupon is so thin that you could see through it yuk"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at black Angus for a change the one at arrowhead sucks so we went here and it was great clean restaurant had a burger it was great and really good so I would recommend this if you want to eat so eat at black Angus go to this one"}
{"text":"The first two tables we went to were dirty. We ended up at a clean third table. My Honeybunch received a free birthday steak so we stayed. The food and out waiter were wonderful."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times for various celebrations, and have enjoyed it every time. 
The waiters are very friendly, and always recommend the best things on the menu. The last time we went, our waitress recommended the Campfire Feast, and it was wonderful! We ordered the appetizer sampler, two steak dinners, and the chocolate cake (we had to get the cake to go, because we were so full!) for a great price. 
The steaks are cooked just how you ask, and servers ask you to cut into your steak before you eat to make sure it is done to your liking. 
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Will never go to this place ever drinks bad and food is horrible . Never ever never again can not make a good drink dam shrimp microwave rice was horrible and to top it off they really think  there  food is good well guess what u suck"}
{"text":"I come here with my family often. I usually get the campfire deal. The food is always delicious and fresh. The service is outstanding!! When you eat here ask for Kieth. He always gives fantastic service! I will always return here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 5 to 7 years ago, and was not impressed. I recently wanted a steak and our usual place was closed, it was about 9:30 pm. It was pretty empty, as a matter of fact, everytime we go it's usually empty. But better for us. I always order the filet mignon steak, medium. Everytime, it's perfection. It's always done just to my liking and its still juicy and very tender. Not chewy and hard like other places. The broccolli is to die for, they serve it steamed with parmesean cheese on it. Yum. I haven't ever tried anything else on the menu, (why go to a steak place and not order steak? duh.) but I do always make sure to order the mud pie dessert. I get it to go, the portion is so big I eat a little then take it home and can eat the rest of it a couple days later. They always have coupons floatig around, but even without one, this place is still an affordable steak restraunt."}
{"text":"Please, actually cook the green beans! Yes they're special saut√©ed blanched wonders, but steam them first, al denti green beans just means you feel healthy eating then but they're not actually edible! All else as expected. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Our food was delicious! We were surprised by how good it was. Our waiter Timothy was amazing. He was incredibly polite and on point. He made our night out extra special! The cheesecake was very good. Glad we choose to come here tonight."}
{"text":"Was a very good experience I would recommend this location to any of my friends and family.  The food and service was excellent.  Staff members went above and beyond to keep us full an accommodated.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"On point! Our server Elizabeth was truly concerned to make our experience great. My wife and I wanted a moderate priced great tasting lunch that was a little closer to a dinner experience. This place met that requirement solidly. We love the Black Angus Bread and started with that. People you've got to try their lunch specials. Five items to choose. My wife went with 1/2 rack of baby backs, loaded bake potato. Tried the green beans (only item not so good so don't order) but, Elizabeth changed it for a very nice asparagus. I pondered filet mignon, but decided on an end cut of prime rib. Awesome! Lunch comes with a drink. I left a little over 20% tip. The total bill tax, tip was $49.00! No coupon! Just can't beat this deal for the quality."}
{"text":"Since coming to Chandler for business in April, I have been here many times - it is right by work. I have never been disappointed with the meals, drinks or service. I often sit at the bar and almost every occasion I have been served by Ryan, who goes out of his way to make you feel welcome and to answer any questions or provide suggestions. I would most wholeheartedly recommend this establishment to anyone in the Chandler area, whether a local or visiting the area for business or pleasure."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! Katie was our server. Very kind and professional. I'll tell you about me, I am a drinker...not that kind! Lol. I'm a water drinker and most of the tip depends on whether or not you can keep up with my thirst. Mean, I know, but hey I can't help it! She brought me two waters right away , one with ice and one without.  I guzzled the one without ice and she quickly replaced it. She actually came back to check often enough that both glasses were full throughout the entire meal. She brought us a cowboy cookie for our anniversary. My first time ever coming here. Will return soon. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation through OpenTable for a 6:15pm and wasn't seated until 7:15pm. It was explained to me that there was a problem with their system and it booked too many reservations for 5:45p which made my party have to wait over an hour for our table. We finally sit down and wait almost an hour and a half for our food. The manager came to the table and instead Of apologizing for the long wait he decides to blame our waitress for everything! I will NOT come back here if someone paid me!"}
{"text":"They served ok steaks for us. But previously they gave us better steaks so I would like to know why they have changed their quality compared to before. I was shocked to eat their steak today."}
{"text":"Good lean steak! Medium rare still a bit too dry. But my friend and two seniors likes their medium well steak Betty much. Great service! Just a little slow :) love their complementary bread the most!"}
{"text":"One of the things I like at Black Angus is the booths. They are taller and it blocks a lot of the sound which lets you hold conversations without yelling. The restaurant has lights that are dimmed a bit. It looks nice inside and fells homely. They have a moderately priced menu with steaks being the high priced items and there primary dishes but everything we tried was great! I got the chicken tenders with chipotle-buffalo sauce and blue cheese and it was amazing. I really liked it.

Our server seemed new and continued to forget many of our requests when we were missing silverware, needing refills or sauces. But he was really nice, considerate and a lot of fun.

This is a busy area and parking can fill up in the evening on weekends. You might need to park a ways from the restaurant.

Black Angus is a good restaurant. You should come and check it out!"}
{"text":"Ive been to this location three times so far and the food has always been good.  Each time I ordered something different, and each time the food tasted fresh and was fairly flavorful.  

The service is also very good. Each time the waiter/waitress has been friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Visited on Monday, April 30th we waited 1 hour for the food when it finally arrived it was overcooked and cold. The manager said they had a new cook and that he was sorry, he said the general manager would call, however this didn't happen.  We saw 6 other tables  have similar situations. Second time we tried this location, both times really bad experiences. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Got here for dinner at 6:30 And asked for a table for 4. Hostess told us the wait was 45 minutes.  Ok, inconvenient, but whatever. Went to use the bathroom, walked through the restaurant and counted 18 open tables. When I asked the waitress why the wait was so long, when there are so many open tables, she said that they don't have enough servers.  That, to me, is terrible management. So you have to wait outside,  can't have a cocktail cuz we have grandma and kids who can't sit on bar stools. Lame!"}
{"text":"Friday night dinner with my family was perfect! 

Stellar service from our regular server Dani and her protege. The manager was very helpful, and I appreciate the entire staff's dedication to keeping people's drinks filled. 

Steak was cooked to request, and the salads were super chilled and fresh."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service at this location.   Found myself in the area and decided to stop in for dinner  older location, plenty of parking .   Warmly greeted and promptly seated   Jeremy was our waiter and he is a  5 star server.    We began with the wagon wheel sampler, awesome for those that can't agree or want variety.  Top sirloin 8oz perfectly cooked and dining companion has end cut prime rib.  Both come with your choice of 2 sides.  I enjoyed side salad, friend had caesars with nice portion of shaved parmigiano.   Sunday is all day happy hour, so great time to take a break and enjoy a drink and apps.    Booths are nice, large with tall backs, keeps conversations intimate with low noise level.   If you go be sure to ask to be seated with Jeremy, nice young man who is on the top of his game."}
{"text":"I ate at Black Angus Steakhouse for the first time yesterday evening with some friends for dinner.  Even though the waiter was pleasant, the food was marginsl.  I had a filet and it was definitely not a higher end cut of meat.  It was cooked okay and the bake potato tasted as though it had been reheated from earlier baking. I csn definitely say there are too many other steak places to est and definitely get your monies worth.  Probably won't go back there."}
{"text":"Food was great when we finally got it! Our drink order was messed up the first time and took over 20 minutes to come out. The app took just as long and then when were finally done eating management argued with me about a coupon instead of just honoring what it actually said. There was almost nobody else there so I'm not sure why the food took so long but I understand why it was empty. Server was great but good took too long and management was rude."}
{"text":"I LUV Black Angus.  The Food is GREAT and the Service EXCELLENT.  

The Prime Rib is Great
The Ribs are very good
The Hamburgers are thick and juicy.

I LUV wedge salads, and they supply an excellent one.

Their Steak Soup is also Very Good."}
{"text":"They always have good properly cooked steaks and the bread is free.  The prime rib can be hit or miss on quality. The beer selection here can be slim but they have one of each type.  So if you are looking for a mid to high priced good steak meal this is a good place.   Service is mostly great. Clean."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday. We had the best device! Roy C is an asset here. Take care of him."}
{"text":"Without getting drafty, all was A1.  Had campfire feast for two.  Wife had a perfect filet and I had prime rib.  All was great.  And that Chocolate cake is to die for."}
{"text":"My mom and I always have dinner here. Filet Mignon is always cooked to perfection :)"}
{"text":"Black Angus is definitely not the first place that I think of when it comes to steakhouses however its not bad. I mostly find myself here when I have a coupon for their campfire feast for two (only $39) which is a great deal if you ask me. You get to choose an appetizer, I recommend the wagon wheel sampler, then each choose an entree, I've had the prime rib, new york strip, ribeye and haven't been disappointed once, and lets not forget their selection of great sides whether its a salad or the sweet potato fries they have a good variety for everyone. Then to top the meal off you get to choose a dessert, I am personally a sucker for their chocolate cake but the cheesecake is very good as well. Overall this is a good steakhouse to go to if you are on a budget its definitely a bang for your buck!."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. Most days 3 stars, every now and then 5 stars, and now myself and my husband will never come back to this restaurant. The service was terrible.  The server seemed to be overwhelmed with his 4 tables. The table next to ours was complaining as well with more complaints than I can imagine. I've been in the service industry and still am for 22 years. Never  have recieved my salad after my meal and have never had cold crab legs. Saw on my bill the crab legs  were taken off as I requested  (with no apology or replacement by my server) just an \"uh...ok..and off he went. Never seen a server so frazzled with 4 tables, maybe a bad day? Don't know. His attitude was the same with each table he dealt with that I observed. On my bill the reason given for  the crab legs taken off were \"customer didn't like\" Are you freaking kidding me??? My favorite food of all time, just don't like them cold! Weird? And I still tipped that jerk $20 & it Would've been  $40 to $50 per my norm if the service was good, but it was horrible. Something I also noticed,  no manager responds to any of these yelp reviews, so in short, Black Angus doesn't really  give a shit about our experience or opinion.  Btw, manager took out drink order, brought our drinks, then we saw our server. Never saw manager again unail she told my husband to have a good night when we were leaving! Hahaha!"}
{"text":"Watched bus lady put clean dishes on the chairs while she wiped table. She also used same tag on seats then the table. No surprise she wiped her nose with the back of her hand while putting bread plates out. SO GROSSED OUT."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy the campfire coupon a few times a year. We have for a long time. About a year ago, we stopped going. The food was on a rapid decline. Since they have been so good for so long, I gave them another chance. We were very happy because they went back to the quality and standards they had been slipping from. Thanks!"}
{"text":"when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.

well, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY. 

it was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...

our waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'

then our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.

i lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. 

we ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had. 

as we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing. 

awful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in. 

if wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it."}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 stars easily, but can't find a single thing to complain about. 

We had a birthday dinner coupon and showed it to the waitress (I think it's Rachel, but can't see the end of the name on the receipt). She told us how it worked (basically BOGO - sign up at their website) and I ordered the 8 oz prime rib and mud pie and my husband Mark ordered the 12 oz rib eye with mushrooms on top. Side orders were loaded potatoes, green beans with bacon, and onion rings. The waitress was friendly and had just the right balance of not hovering but never leaving us alone more than 10 minutes at a time. The food was delivered promptly. Every single thing was perfectly cooked (entrees rare for me and medium well for Mark). She brought the extra butter I had asked for. My husband devoured the excellent bread that they provide at every table.  The drink refills appeared just as we needed them. The manager came by to check on every table and took away our dishes for us when we were done. Because it was my birthday meal, they brought out a warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream that was amazing (and free) and my mud pie was excellent (says my husband - I keep forgetting mud pie is coffee flavored and I dislike coffee). We had to take it home with us (a great hardship - hah) because we were just too full. I had seen some bad yelp reviews so I almost didn't go and would have missed out on an amazing meal. Great job to everyone who helped (cooks, waitress, and manager). Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here for my sister's birthday celebration. It was the first time any of us in my family had been there.

Food- delicious! We ordered 2 specials where you have 2 people pick an entree, one appetizer to share, 2 sides each and 1 dessert to share. I ordered the filet mignon sandwich that came with 1 side. The appetizers came out fairly quickly and we got served molasses bread with butter. I highly recommend the baked spinach and artichoke dip! Our entires were delicious and since we were stuffed, we were able to pack our desserts to go! 

Service- I forgot our waitress' name, but she was amazing! She was always good about checking on us and our drinks. She was very accommodating with her recommendations and seating us with my rambunctious 1.5 year old niece, and even helped us with the desserts. She was thoughtful and brought us bags to carry our take-out and left overs. Whoever she is, she definitely made it time here great!"}
{"text":"We went back tonight to celebrate my 9 year wedding anniversary and again great service as always. I had the prime rib with Cesar salad and potato soup ( Delicious ). The prime rib was once again cooked perfectly ( medium ) it melted in my mouth. For dessert we got a big chocolate chip cookie for our anniversary and the mud pie for our dessert that came with the meal. Again the manager Michael came and checked on us and welcomed us back and made sure we were taken care of. Great meal. Only bad thing is the campfire meal for two is HUGE. Couldn't finish it. Had to take it home. Will be back."}
{"text":"I am a steak lover but I must say this wouldn't be somewhere i would recommend. Our steaks were cooked wrong, had a pretty blah taste and we sat in the restaurant for 20 min before anyone asked us about drinks. The drinks were $9 and were supposed to be \"top shelf\" uh I thinks not. tasted very watered down and I decided to limit myself to one at that price to quality ratio. The only part of the experience that was worth while the observing the table sitting next to us. Listening to them bicker back and fourth and argue about what they were going to get was quite entertaining....... I would not recommend going there for anyone there is plenty of other options close by that will leave you satisfied"}
{"text":"Nice decor, lots of tvs in the bar, Lisa and Dani provide THE best service, and I love that they offer different entree choices for different seasons on the outsert of the menu. You can count on your favorites still being there while looking forward to trying something new."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Black Angus locations and this one is the best.  The atmosphere is good whether it's lunch time or dinner time.  The service is always friendly and usually pretty good.  The manager will come through and ask how you're doing and clear dishes and such.  That is a rarity to see management do any kind of manual labor.  I do feel that it is a bit pricier here than it should be.  $29 for a steak and they want to charge extra for a side of asparagus?  That does not seem right, but I will definitely eat here again.  The steaks are awesome."}
{"text":"A very disappointing night for this restaurant. We frequently place to go orders for the prime rib dinner. Normally this prime rib is outstanding. Tonight we ordered 3 prime rib dinners and the entremets. This meal $120+ and then we have $20 tip in cash. Upon laying the meal out I noted the prime rib was raw/rare and not medium rare as we ordered. I contacted Black Angus and spoke to the Manager Marshal. What I anticipated him saying was let us remake those for you. Instead he was forced apologetic and defending that he saw them before we got them and they looked fine from the outside. He then said he hadn't closed out the day yet so he would take 50% of my total bill because he felt if I cooked them up a little bit then they would be fine! I asked him for a way to send him photos as even from the outside you can see they are not medium rare. They certainly are not the quality we have become accustomed to. In addition whether I choose McDonalds or Black Angus the common link is I don't want to cook. The point of contention however is McDonald's would remake my meals without question and never suggest I cook them myself. I am beyond disappointed and rethinking my choice of locations to dine. This one clearly has lost site of what is important and I paid $75+ to eat two pieces of broccoli and then ordered Dominos."}
{"text":"I used to go to Black Angus frequently years ago, it's not so good any more.  Its not terrible but defiantly dropped points. 

I got the steak and fried shrimp.  Shrimp was good but the steak was a bit chewy.  

My caesar salad was good but my wife's wedge salad looked a bit small and she didn't seem impressed.

We may go back if the desire hits."}
{"text":"Food, service, prep quality were great. Management  NOT. A busser dropped a saucer of barbecue sauce next to me, it covered my white leather shoes, my leg, and my shorts. Server , Lisa, was great, lending a helping hand. Management on the other hand, said we can only pay for your DRY CLEANING, how do you dry clean leather shoes. Oh, and for the review stating all negative reviews come from the bar drunks, we had just set down, know drinks yet. Any type of an offerer from MANAGEMENT would have been nice, a desert, a cocktail, some offer. NOTHING , And to quote the GENERAL MANAGER, SHAWN O'BRAY, ( WE HAVE HAD ONLY 27 PEOPLE IN TONIGHT AND WE CAN\"T GET ANY THING RIGHT)  I know the hours are long, but you need to treat people the way you would like to be treated. Oh, we will go back and see our great server, Lias."}
{"text":"We frequent black angus once or twice a month.We always enjoy our steaks and there flavors and also enjoy the prime rib. We always have had great service and Lisa took care of us today and was outstanding. Very attentive, friendly and made sure everything was made and cooked perfect for us. She made our dining experience a pleasant one and we will always be asking for her on future visits."}
{"text":"Wow! Lots of fantastic choices. Unique takes on comfort foods. I really like all the grilled options on the menu . Lots of gluten free options as well. Plenty of seafood dishes and cooked to perfection. Also all the salads I've had so far are fantastic ! The picture above is not accurate of what the place looks like?? . The style is modern but warm and inviting. This patio is a perfect place to hang out with friends ! And the floor to ceiling windows are fantastic. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We chose to go here last night when my hubby was in the mood for some steak & for being a chain we were pleasantly surprised. For being a Friday evening we were able to be sat without having to wait & we were greeted by our server Maricella who turned out to be great. We chose to start with the appetizer sampler which had the panko zucchini, panko chicken tenders, shrimp cocktail with 4 large shrimp & 2 perfectly cooked potato skins.... FYI some of the best potato skins that we've had. The sampler for being mostly fried was at least freshly breaded then fried not that typical selection of previously breaded, frozen then fried stuff that they call food. For the entrees I chose the grilled salmon with fresh string beans with crumbled bacon on top & a baked potato with all the fixings & I also got a side of saut√©ed button portobello mushrooms which everything was perfectly cooked & nothing was over cooked & dry or mushy. My hubby went with the 12 oz NY strip cooked medium with string beans & the loaded potato & he chose to have some saut√©ed onions for the top of the steak. Everything was cooked perfect & the one thing he appreciated was they requested that he cut into the steak to assure that the temp was to his liking, it was so juicy he didn't even need his A1 sauce!! We ended our meal with some cheesecake to bring home with us because we were beyond full!! We will definitely go back here as we didn't have any complaints in the food or server department which is so nice. Maricella was also on top of everything & she was there for us whenever we needed without it her being overly hovering!!"}
{"text":"Only Bc I can't provide zero stars. We've been to this particular Black Angus previously, & have always had good service & great food. 

This time the steak was over cooked, we asked for medium rare, ended up with what I would consider well done. Had no pink at all. The salad had old looking pieces of lettuce in it, couldn't even eat it. The baked potato was slightly over cooked, but even at that, was probably the best part of the whole meal. 

Our waitress Shayla A, at first seemed very kind & accommodating, even offered to replace the salad with soup of our choice. But when it came to making the meal right? She said there was nothing she could do, it was cooked exactly how we ordered, & she couldn't ask the chef to recook another steak when what she served was fine. We asked to speak with a manager, only to be told there wasn't one on duty. This was about 8:00 in the evening.  

We left there, disappointed & hungry & went next door to LongHorn Steak house, & had an amazing meal. I won't go back to Black Angus, but will most definitely frequent LongHorn which is literally right next door anyway."}
{"text":"3rd chance, you will NOT get from me. You call THAT a salad?!? It had blue cheese \"liquid\", not blue cheese dressing. 25% of my 16oz steak was fat. Excuse me, but I have enough of that already. As for the remaining 12oz, if it were not for the salt, this steak had NO flavor. I had salt at home I could have eaten. My wife's baby back ribs were as dry as the Sahara! Fry's has better ribs for HALF the price. Service was OK.....I mean, as our waiter was bringing us the check, he asked if we wanted dessert. So he must have known our answer would be \"no\" or he was going to comp us dessert to make up for the over-priced and low quality food. Black Angus.....you've been Black-listed. Btw.....Yelp says I have to leave a star rating, so against my desires, I rated you 1 star more than I would have liked. Gosh, I'm so mean; but then again you did take me for my money, so we're even,"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Went in because I work close by and wanted something new for lunch. I will now be making this my regular spot. The staff was friendly and efficient. My food came out quickly and was delicious. I will be telling the office about this place. Went back a few days later for happy hour and the Moscow mule is a must! A manager stopped by to check on the service and was very genuine. Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal on a Thursday night.  I had the prime rib perfectly rare as I ordered it and the wife enjoyed her tri-tip., Also perfectly grilled.  We had a wonderful server and wish I remembered her name.  Pretty busy but food brought out in acceptably short time.  Only minor complaint was the onion rings.  Obviously standard food service type and was hoping for a more hand made but my loaded bCked potato made up for it."}
{"text":"I have lived in AZ for 20+ years and have never tried this place...Ok I admit it!!! My friend and I really liked it . We shared the dinner for two. Our appetizer of choice was the zucchini. It's battered in a light Panco breadcrumb. The crispness and crunch was great and I LOVE the fact that it was not a greasy soggy mess. It is served with a fresh, light cucumber sauce which complements the veggie very well.

I had the filet with blue cheese and chose garlic mashed potatoes along with green beans. The filet was cooked just as I ordered. The steak was melt in your mouth tender. The potatoes were fresh with small chunks and lots of garlic. The green beans are crisp. My guess is the chef blanches them, ice water bathes them. They are kissed on the grill for flavor just before serving. Just perfect!

My guest had the New York with green beans and onion rings and was equally pleased!  The dessert was a shared piece of chocolate cake. The cake was moist and very rich. 

The decor was a little dated and could use a modern twist! The bar was beautiful and had many customers. I liked the booth height. It kept the noise down and made it private.

Our server was Shannon. Our drinks were NEVER empty. She was pleasant and knew the menu well. She made our first experience a great one! We both plan on returning. A great value for the money!

{"text":"We like Black Angus but only come when there's a coupon. Prices are far too expensive for what you get without the coupon. Service is typically good but cooks getting your steak cooked correctly is hit n miss. Never fun to have one waiting for food while the other either eats alone or let's their food get cold."}
{"text":"Never been to a Black Angus Steakhouse. I am happy I decided to have dinner with my wife here. Food was great. The service we got from the waiter was far above and beyond great. I'm not from the area but if I come back I would definitely come and here again"}
{"text":"I just had one of the worst dining experiences I have ever encountered in my life. I made the reservation for 15 people 3 days prior to my arrival for my boyfriends 35th birthday party. BIG mistake. We arrived early, at 6:45pm on a Saturday night, thinking there would be a crowd. There was none, and it was completely dead. To my surprise, they have lost my reservation and had zero clue about my calling. Mind you, the gentleman I spoke with repeated my requests and assured me of my reservation. They finally get a table ready for us at 7:01pm and it was one, very long table, enclosed with a booth. Basically, once you got in your seat, you were locked in for the remainder of the dinner unless you want to ask 7 people to move so you can use the restroom. So, we clustered around, trying to figure out how this was going to work for us and basically did their job for them and separated the tables so that we could all be comfortable. Upon sitting, several of the appetizer plates were greasy and filthy. Gross! The food was COMPETELY over priced. My shrimp was half raw and several others had severely hard buns and rock hard hamburger patties. I chose this place because it was the only steak house to allow reservations. I wanted my boyfriend to have a special evening and instead it was only a big giant stressful experience. Going out you eat should be easy. It should be less stressful than cooking at home. I paid way too much for our meal. It was nothing more than cafeteria food at a fine dining price. Never again."}
{"text":"The help was good, but the steak wasn't. Ordered the top sirloin, medium rare and was served a very dry steak with almost no pink at all. Wasn't enjoyable. The friendly staff did offer to replace it once i showed it to them, but was on a timeline and had the youngster with me. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I reviewed this restaurant once before, but it seems to have disappeared. My last review was also 4 stars and I wanted to see the name of the waitress I commented on as we were going back. 
There are always great deals that come in the coupon packet in the mail, making the 2 dinners for $40 a bargain for a night out, and leaves you with leftovers for lunch the next day.
On this trip, our server Charles was working very hard to make sure that our drinks were kept full and that our orders were prepared properly."}
{"text":"Food was better than Outback Steakhouse but also double the price. 

Black angus like any chain you know what to expect but with how dead it was in here they better think about reverse happy hour or better pricing. They also wouldn't let me switch mashed potatoes out on the kids meal where they offer rice, broccoli and French fries...however they're equal sides on the main menu. An extra $2.50 for mashed potatoes with Kraft Mac and cheese makes the kid's meal $8.50! They also forgot our daughters included sundae....oh I forgot the $1.25 for kids drink (we're now at $9.75) might as well got my five year old an adult dinner. 

Anyways, food was prepared accurately hence the 3 stars. Overall general impression...ehhhhhhhhh, we won't be back any time soon."}

{"text":"Fabulous fabulous fabulous! We used to live in Washington three years ago and moved to Denver. Before we left Washington restaurant and I believe there's only one or Two left in the state. we had been craving angus big potato soup, bread an better, and steaks of course. It was amazing and everything was perfect. And I wish I could remember the servers name to tell them an extra thank you. It was our 10 year wedding anniversary and this is where we decided to go. Loved every minute. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews unless they are positive, but this time I had to make an exception. We made reservations on Christmas Eve for a friends wedding dinner. We looked forward to good food and a good experience. There were only a handful of customers when we arrived.  Our server was late with our high chair for our 1 year old, she complained about how tired she was from working two jobs, our water was late along with every single thing we ordered. Our friends order was not correct and our server was late on correcting that as well. At one point, we thought she had left early because there was no sight or found of anyone for over 30 minutes while we were waiting on one of our orders. A different individual showed up with our salads and soups... but they weren't what we ordered either! Our supper was average. Prime rib was good but the NY Strip was under par. The most positive thing I can muster to share is that the water was cold and wet. That's it. My husband and I now have an ongoing joke about this location (which we have now shared with several friends and colleagues with similar experiences here). Whenever we see their campfire ads and coupons, we laugh and talk about our awful experience. I know I complained about the service the most, but the food and experience is not justifiable in the price you pay. At all. And that's sad coming from me because like I first stated, I don't give out reviews unless they are positive...and this was far from good."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger and figured with a name like Black Angus, theirs would meet my needs. I've had better burgers and I've had worse. I'd go back if I was in the are and heard the burger call again (I hear it often enough).

As for the 4 stars, I was flittering between 3 and 4 (half stars Yelp! half stars!) ... Korina's 3 star rating seemed to be the decider for me. With our powers combined, we're at 3.5 - which is just about right."}
{"text":"Great food but super slow service.  Took 1:25 for lunch today and I only get 1:00 for lunch!  Eeeeeek!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I had never been here before, but we received a gift card so thought we'd try it. We typically do carry out, so we called in an order for 2 steaks. They told us 20 minutes.

We arrived at the proper time and it wasn't ready. We sat there for another 25 minutes before they brought it out to us, cold. I've attached the pathetic image I was presented with upon opening it back at home.

The manager offered us a dessert when he brought out our food, but as we had no desire to keep sitting there letting our food get even colder, we went home.

I do not recommend them at all. Save your money."}
{"text":"I understand when you order Prime Rib rare, that occasionally you are told that is not an option, especially if later in the evening.  No hard feelings.  To sit there for 40 minutes before being told that, after staring at our appetizer for over 1/2 an hour, is pretty ridiculous.  Had we known going in that it wasn't an option (as that is what we went to get), we probably wouldn't have chosen to stay, but at that point it was to late to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went there for Mothers day 
It was awful. We normally go to Black Angus By Metro Center.
I had Prime Rib I like it medium Rare I got it well done they took it back brought out another one it was cold including Backed Potatoe .
I spend two meals $80..00 it supose to be $59.00. My Son 17 had Salmon that came out burned and Dry .  
Waitress was Root. Not even saying hi how are you when we first arrived just my son and was there .
I will never go back to this Black Angus on Bell road."}
{"text":"Came here first time after seeing ads for years.  Expected a steak full of grizzle & tenderizer, but was pleasantly surprised it was lean & grilled to my expectations.  It was crowded but our server was still prompt & friendly.  It might not be s 5 Star restaurant but still quality very good and pricing affordable, especially the Campfire Feast for 2 which includes an appetizer & dessert to share.  All in all, good value!"}
{"text":"Not very good food and high prices for okay chicken.... I know other steakhouses that have much better options with some flavor!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for our grandfathers birthday. Figured we could try it since he loves steakhouses. We made a reservation but it really wasn't needed...this place was not busy at all, especially for 630pm on a Saturday night. 
First we got off on the wrong foot because we asked to be seated at a larger table (6 people and 1 baby). The hostess said no because they save it for large groups (it had 8 chairs). 
Ok everything was fine after but the food took forever! The margarita I ordered was poorly made. We did accidentally spilt a glass of water and they brought napkins promptly. But after cleaning up the water with the white napkin I realized the table was discustingly dirty...like black dirty. 

The food was not that bad but the chicken from the kids meal kind of tasted like there was a hint of metal. Yeah it was gross...like McDonald's chicken is better.

Probably won't return. Even with a good coupon this place was not worth it. 

Cmon black Angus step it up!"}
{"text":"The lemonade was on point. It was so cooling and refreshing. The prime rib was so tender and juicy. It was cooked to perfection. The green beans were crisp and not over cooked. The lunch service was alright."}

{"text":"First and foremost this is the last time my fianc√©e and I will ever be going to black angus! I made the decision to go to black angus for our anniversary, and boy did I regret going there! I originally was craving their delicious mango raspberry tea and we haven't been there in a while so we decided to go.  We both ordered top sirloin steak,  both wanted the steak to be medium. When the order came out my steak was more like medium well to well done, there was no pink at all in the steak!!! The server immediately went to grab management to come \"look\" at the steak. The manager was nice he observed and took my entire plate and advised a new steak will be made correctly.  About 10-15 mins later give or take my steak came back out again and the manager advised that I cut my steak to make sure it was perfect . For my wasted time he advised he would take off half of the bill which came up to be 7$ ....  Now as I cut my steak open once again the steak was not medium .... It was still medium well ..to done....Of course at this time we had waited so much time and we had other plans for that day I figured I don't ever want to be that customer that complains about her food but then again I never complain so I just said it was fine but was very disappointed because you can clearly see that it was still medium well to done ! The quality of the steak was not good at all for the price tough and chewy! We will def not be returning and would recommend you all to longhorn or Texas Roadhouse!!! Something needs to be done in the kitchen ... I hate to write bad reviews but this one has to be written."}
{"text":"Worst experience with a restaurant in a really long time. For how much you pay you would expect to actually get service, a concept apparently unheard of at this place. Waited for 20 minutes for the server to come, they never came so decided to switch to a different section in the restaurant. Finally after waiting some more the waiter finally came. Had to repeat me drink order (iced tea, no lemon) THREE times!!! And ordering a salad no tomato was a struggle to say the least. Wa snot offered bread and guess what, my tea still came with lemon! I can take it out but still it's not that hard of an order. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"i wish i could give it no stars as i never got to eat here. i waited forever but no one served me so heres one lady that will never be back"}
{"text":"I used to live in Alaska and go to the Black Angus there almost once a week.  The food was usually great, but when it wasn't, the staff was quick to fix it and make it right. While vacationing in Phoenix, we decided to try the Phoenix location and weren't sure what to expect. Three of us ordered steaks, 1 person ordered chicken, and another ordered the salmon. To our excitement, we all had absolutely perfectly cooked steaks, chicken and salmon. The only thing that was disappointing was that the steaks weren't bigger. Ha, ha. They were big, but because they tasted so amazing, we were wanting more. The salads, soup and zucchini appetizer were also wonderful. Everything about the restaurant was awesome. The food was fresh, beautifully presented and prepared and the staff was friendly, full of enthusiasm and always checking on us to make sure we had what we needed. I haven't seen outstanding customer service like that in a long time. This Black Angus is located next door to two other steakhouses, but I wouldn't waste your time going to either of those places. The food, the staff, and the prices at the Black Angus were perfect. Kudos to the management there for making it such a great restaurant, because it obviously showed in the positive attitudes/smiles from the wait staff and the quality of the product the kitchen put out. We will definitely return to this Black Angus on our next visit to Phoenix.  Thank you for making our July 2, 2017 visit so perfect."}
{"text":"Affordable luxury!  Our waitress (Jenny) was among the best waitresses we have ever encountered.  Food was excellent as always. The manager worked his way around the restaurant to ensure everyone was well taken care of."}
{"text":"We don't often wander by the old Metrocenter Mall these days, even though when my wife and I were both in college, Metrocenter was a happening place.

But, after a long road trip coming back from Jerome, we decided to stop by this place and have an early dinner on a Saturday afternoon - early enough to beat the crowds.

From the time that we entered this place up until we were nearly ready to pay, the reception and the service could be characterized as cold and underwhelming. And the food was bland and boring.

We figured that since we were here when there were no crowds yet, that we would get the best service, and food preparation. However, what we got was a service that seemed like we were a nuisance, and our food seemed like it came right out of the fridge and quickly prepared and unseasoned. The food really looked better on the picture than what they tasted. Just absolutely dreadful!

The only time that we felt the server perked up was when it was time to settle the bill, and that being \"tip time.\" Very disappointingly fake. I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy this atmosphere; especially since there was barely anyone in the restaurant."}

{"text":"Absolutely terrible service and mediocre (at best) food.

 Arrived here at about 7:50 PM on a Monday night. The place was somewhat busy, all with people watching the final March Madness game. The game ended, and all but two tables (other than ours) left. After the game ended, the ambiance was very awkward. It was near silent and the pop music playing on the PA system over the dining area was clashing with the country music that was playing at the entry-way. 

We were seated, and a waitress came (I think her name was Brieana) and took our drink orders. Nearly 10 minutes later, a different server came to drop our drinks off. Then, another 10 minutes later, she came to take our orders. My boyfriend and I both ordered the build your own burger with some of the cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer. We were not asked how we wanted our meats cooked either. When we told her what we wanted, she sort of rolled her eyes at us both. Most likely because she figured we were both just two kids not ordering the higher-dollar menu items (even though they nickel and dime you for EVERY item you put on your build your own burger). From then on, we waited. And waited. And waited. 

Very rarely did she come out to bring us drink refills, and when she did, she left the empty glasses at the table. 30 minutes from the time we ordered, we asked the manager to bring us some bread. But, it seems as if this restaurant has an all around failure to communicate, because as soon as he left our waitress brought the bread out, followed by the manager who brought us another loaf. After the complimentary loaves were brought out, our cheesy garlic bread came. It was probably the best part of the meal, and that's saying quite a bit considering that you get about 5 1-inch slices of soggy, greasy bread. Not worth $5.99.

We left a couple of pieces of the garlic bread on the plate it was served on, and stacked all of the other plates that were now empty on the corner of our table to make room for our food that would hopefully be arriving soon (again, refer to photos). The one busser in the entire restaurant came by and took our plate with the pieces of garlic bread on it, and left all of the empty plates. Why on earth would you take the food AWAY from the table and leave the dirty plates? Makes no sense whatsoever. So essentially, we got 3 pieces of garlic bread for $5.99... 

20 minutes from the time we got our bread, our food arrived (nearly an hour after we were seated). The bun of the burger was hard, as if it was sitting under a food lamp all day. The burger was charred. I like my meat as rare as it gets, and would assume that if the waitress didn't ask how we wanted it cooked that it would come cooked medium. Apparently not. It was like a hockey puck. The tomatoes served on the side were mealy and seemed nearly rotten. The coleslaw was warm, and the fries also seemed like they were cooked under a heat lamp all day. Not once did the waitress come by to check on us during the meal service, nor were any of our dirty plates cleared. By the end of our meal service, we had stacks of plates and seven empty glasses sitting on our table (refer to the photos). 

She dropped off our check at around 9:10 PM. I immediately placed my card in the book, as I wanted to leave as soon as possible. She walked past it nearly 10 times, and at 9:25 or so finally picked it up. She came to bring by drink refills during this period, but left so quickly that we couldn't even hand her the bill. 

Her tip was an absolute reflection of her service. She most likely had the idea that we were just two college-aged kids who were going to tip poorly anyhow. But, if she was more attentive, did her job correctly, or even checked on us once more during the meal service, she would have gotten more than a mere 10% (and that was generous considering her attitude). Serving isn't that difficult in a nearly empty restaurant, sweetheart."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the staff at this location was very cool and friendly. That being said, we just arrived in town and were sat at 8pm. Maybe it was because of the late hour but service was very slow. We ordered the dinner for two special which was good for the price. Appetizer, entree, sides and a dessert for $58. Nothing too crazy. We heard a woman at the next table complaining about the cut of meat. Hey! It's $58 for two people! Eat your meat or you don't get any pudding! The meal was good for us, just slow service. Definitely not the greatest but not horrible either. Hey, walk ins had to wait so how bad could it be."}
{"text":"My husband and I had prime rib tonight and our steaks were cooked perfectly.  I have mine well done and he has medium well.  The chef did a great job.     
We have never been to Black Angus ( although we live in the neighborhood) and we will definately return.  Our server, Kelsey was outstanding and she even waited on the waiter's table across from us since he was somewhere else.
The General Manager went through the dining room to make sure everyone had a good meal and that was impressive, for sure.

5 stars to this restaurant !!"}
{"text":"My family and I love Black Angus and had a large dinner spending approximately $100 on our meal.  

We decided to enjoy the chocolate brownie with ice cream that my wife and I could share.  We had the two can eat for $39 ( Something Like That ) meal.

Anyways, the big brownie comes out with a TINY scoop of ice cream.  I asked the waitress if we could get another scoop and she said that would be $1.50 additional.  

I was like are you serious ? Our check is approximately $100.  She said it was the cost of food.

No problem, I didn't ask for a manager because I am not going to argue about ice cream.  However, the waitress tip reflected her attitude and non-willingness to obliged.  She could have at least asked her manager about it.  

Let him or her make the decision and don't give a lame excuse \"It's the cost of food\"

Needless to say, we will not be dining at this Black Angus in the future."}

{"text":"Went here on a pretty busy Saturday night and was lucky to get in with a few mins wait. I ordered grilled chicken and I was able to pick two sides. The green beans were amazing! More than amazing, like I can't stop thinking about them and I will go back for just that reason. They were seasoned with pepper and covered in bacon mmmmmmm. Please try them!! You will thank me later."}
{"text":"Terrible, just terrible in every way. 

I ate here on 6/27/15 for my boyfriend's birthday dinner with family. After first sitting down, we complained that our table was /extremely/ wobbly. The waitress was so flustered that she had to ask a manager what to do. He just moved us one table over (wow, genius!) to a smaller booth. Since there were 6 of us, it was quite cramped... Not to mention the rest of the restaurant was basically empty, so we could've had any table in the place. After that, we ordered our drinks and waited a while to get them. The waiteress didn't stick around to take our dinner order. So, we waited. And waited some more. And then I went to check out the bathroom because I was really that bored. Let's just say that some corners were cut in the bathroom. I heard a \"beep beep beep\" sound that was pretty annoying, really adding to the gas station bathroom vibe. When I washed my hands, I noticed a smoke alarm and saw that the battery needed to be changed. In that moment, I realized that the bathroom was as neglected as the customers. Shame on you, Black Angus. What if there was an actual fire? 

Anyway, it's not fair to judge a restaurant entirely on bathrooms and bad service, right? So we finally ordered the food. My boyfriend and I split a hamburger for $13.50. Yeah, it was that expensive. I ate hamburgers in England (when the exchange rate was really sucky) for less than that! Anyway, the food took so long that we ran out of things to talk about other than, \"wherrre is our food?\" 

In the meantime, we heard the staff sing \"Happy Birthday\" to another table. We'd told the waitress that we were there for a birthday, so naturally, we expected the same treatment at some point (spoiler alert: they never sang to us). My boyfriend's little sister finally just laid her face on the table. Well, when we did get the food, it was alright. But nothing I couldn't have made at home. In much less time. For like half that price.

Getting the waitress' attention to take the bill was another challenge. Finally, a guy with a broom walked by, and we asked if he would get our waitress. More waiting of course. I cannot express just how happy I was to walk out of that place, even though it was sweltering outside. 

Point being, there are two other steakhouses next to this pathetic restaurant. Go somewhere less expensive; at Black Angus, the prices don't reflect service (or quality)!"}
{"text":"This place always has good food and service.  I keep going back because of their partnership with the Best Buy Dining Program and their AAA discounts.  Combine that with a coupon found just about anywhere, and two can eat great for around $40!

I've been to this particular location about 10 times in the past two years and the consistency amongst servers and the food is great.  It never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Holy crap this place sucks...
18oz bone in ribeye presented to me looked like it was pan fried with a pressure plate. It should never be PAN FRIED! WTF? If I wanted Waffle House for $130 I would have gone there. I have no idea what to think about Black Angus. I have never been more disappointed in a restaurant than I am right now.  This is something possibly the worst and most expensive worst bullshit I've ever seen or paid for. Ya I paid the bill because unlike the establishment I'm not an asshat."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, and I was impressed with the tastiness of the food both times. We got the dinner for two (whatever special name they call it) both times. We felt there were many options from that option to choose from and were both happy with our choices both times. I think the cocktails are a little overpriced for what you get, and perhaps the food too, but it's still tasty, and that's what really counts here!"}
{"text":"Every time we come here (and there have been plenty over the years), the experience is great. The Campfire Feast is a good deal, made even better by the frequent coupons that show up in the mailbox. 
Weird thing about this locator is that it's directly next door to 2 other steak places now. Still my best pick though, hands down!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation but still had to wait 45 minutes. The waiting area is very small with only a few seats and overcrowded. This place is very popular with the older crowd. The communication from the hostesses when we checked in and while we were waiting wasn't great. Our party of six adults, of which three are large, was seated at a round booth for four people. We had waited so long past our reservation and were so hungry that we cozied up to each other and made the best of it. The food was pretty good. One member of our party, a rib connoisseur, had ribs at four different places that week and liked these the best."}
{"text":"Went into and was greeted by the most wonderful person ever Amanda Riashi,
Made me fell at home and I have never even been here.  Great customer service!
Give her a raise!!!"}
{"text":"Worst $100 spent. Shara our waitress was too busy also attending bar to adequately wait our table. Husband could never get drink refilled, food was only so-so, and she would walk away as we were talking!! Then to top it all off, she would not honor our coupon and AAA discount. Will not be back ...ever !!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful birthday lunch we had today at Black Angus in Glendale, AZ.  Our server, Hannah, was excellent, the food was delicious and cooked exactly as requested, and the atmosphere was extremely inviting.  Hannah returned to the table several times to refresh our drinks and inquire about satisfaction.  Thank you Hannah and staff for making my special birthday such a memorable one."}
{"text":"This is a meat and fish lovers paradise - I love the top sirloin combo with giant prawns. The green beans and brocholi are a great compliment to the dish. Wait staff is excellent here, although I do have companions who tag along sometimes and try everyone's patience with their whiny picky coments. Maybe they should be tied outside during dinner until they learn better manners. Even with a heads up to Tom the manager, they tried to test his patience and our waitress, but she fooled them and they were not able to pee on her territory. Maybe hanging with felines would be better for all? We have been here multiple time in two months arrnd everytime we are thrilled with the food and staff.  We will return.  When you visit be a good boy/girl and sit and be a good doggie!"}
{"text":"Every time we come here we have great service and excellent food. We usually go during the week at lunch time and restaurant is steady but quiet due to tall booths. Prices are good for the quality you get. I have tried many items on menu and everything is always  great. You can never go wrong at Black Angus!!!"}
{"text":"Prime Rib on Wed nights is a tradition at Black Angus.  Prime Rib is always cooked perfect with baked pototo and vegi makes for a perfect meal.  I sit at the bar usually and the bartenders always are friendly and attentive with bringing my beer and food!  
One of my fav places to go week after week. Wednesdays are good because you get a piece of mud pie for dessert along with the meal.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"We went because I was craving artichokes.  Looked up the facebook page and got the coupon.  Rachel was our server...she was really friendly and smiled, and was pretty good but  I felt like we were running her since she would always leave the table quickly.  It was slow when we got there, but then again it was just before 5.  Our meal was paced nicely and the prime rib was more over medium than the mid rare ordered, but overall it was a good dinner."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Check! Service: Check & Check! Food: Check, Check & Check!! This is one Yelp! review I never anticipated writing. Prepare yourself for a dining experience at a sleeper chain steakhouse that blew the collective minds of me and my girlfriend!

I love steak and so does my girlfriend. We were both craving some carne for lunch while out and about yesterday. One other nearby chain was closed because they're not open for lunch. No matter, because I've never enjoyed a remarkable steak there. Lacking other options, my girlfriend suggested Black Angus.

It had literally been years since either of us had dined at a Black Angus. We both recalled how this was the destination for a great steak when we were younger. It's hard to stand out from a crowded market place with such reputable competition. Black Angus just established itself as our go to steakhouse.

First, we cannot say enough about Tamera. She is so good at her job and we plan to ask for her whenever we return. Tamera is friendly, helpful, pleasant conversation intertwined with excellent timing and great service about sums her up. Even the manager who was roaming the dining room seemed genuinely interested. We didn't get his name but the receipt says \"Thomas\". We chatted on the way out and it's clear he really enjoys his job.

Now the food. It's one thing to cook a steak. It's another thing to cook it to temp. And it's another thing to season, cook to temp, and serve a steak that needs no sauce (other than the onions and mushrooms we added). We learned that the grill master was Mauricio. I would ask to see if he is manning the grill, because he cooked one of the best steaks I've ever enjoyed. My entree was the Sirloin with Fried Shrimp, while my girlfriend enjoyed her Prime Rib. Both entrees were excellent! In fact, I have to commend Black Angus for the quality of the meat. There are definitely other places that serve steaks that are nowhere near this quality. And their product is way overpriced.

Finally, we are both still scratching our heads over the deserts. We were too full to enjoy them in the restaurant, so we took them home. When was the last time you ate cake that did not taste like it was refrigerated or frozen? The Coconut Cream and Carrot Cake deserts we ate later we're both delicious and super moist. Great finale!

As mentioned before, this is our new steak destination. For special occasions, with company, or just lunch on a Saturday, it doesn't matter. Black Angus made an amazing impression on the both of us. Well done!"}
{"text":"Went here for my mother-in-law's birthday a few days ago.  Had a great experience overall.  Called ahead and made the reservation for 5 people at 7pm.  Clearly I didn't need one.  We got there and the place was dead.

Service was good, attentive, although she could have been just a bit more \"happy\".  

I ordered a dirty martini to drink (very good) and the grilled chicken breast entree for dinner.  Had a side salad with ranch - fresh and chilled, it was great.  Had steamed broccoli with the chicken which was absolutely awesome (as awesome as steamed broccoli can be) but I wish there was more than the 3 or 4 pieces I got.  Seriously - my plate looked really sad with just a couple pieces of broccoli, while everyone else's plates were overflowing with mashed potatoes or huge double baked potatoes.  Guess that's what I get for trying to eat healthy.  The chicken breast was tender and juicy - yum.  I ate every single last bite.

For dessert they brought out the chocolate chip cookie and ice cream (on the house for the birthday girl) and it was SO good.  I would eat healthy every meal if it meant I could finish with a dessert like that.  Mmm.

Definitely 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great food good customer service as always. Alice the manager is awesome! Always great food. Try a aveleanch next time you are there cause they are great!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars . Each time I've gone my servers have been great . Knowledgeable about the menu, and friendly . They come back often to check on you and see how you are . Lots of parking . One complaint i have is that it is always freezing in there . But like seriously freezing . Still get 5stars though . Just bring a jacket lol . Love this place"}
{"text":"Great salmon- seasoned just right, large portion, perfectly cooked! Two different bartenders made me same drink- first one perfect- second one terrible. Might need to work on that."}
{"text":"The food is not worth the money and the service wasn't awesome. PLUS ! this should be a $$$ sign on cost review.

Review update! When the manager read my review, he was kind enough to message me about my concerns. After the conversation, he offered to send me a gift card in return and apologized for the service we experienced. Today I received the gift card, which might I add was very generous amount. We will be returning to try again, Thank you Thomas Stephenson!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in years... really great dinner! Going back this weekend again. The king crab was delish!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful and overpriced, compared to competitors. Not sure if the steak was the size ordered, compared to competitor offerings at ostensibly the same size. The portions of the sides were also incredibly tiny--which might be a good thing as the quality is very poor. Even the baked potato was the smallest potato I'd ever seen in a restaurant. It had been roughly two years since my last visit to Black Angus, but I will not be returning. 

Outback, Longhorn, and Texas Roadhouse are each about 5-10% cheaper and much, much higher quality. Even the bread kind of sucked. How is this place still operating as a business?"}
{"text":"Had the Rib-Eye and it was very good. Best steak I've had in a long time. Would definitely come back to try something else. Service was also good."}
{"text":"It's quiet, and service is good in the lounge. This is the geriatric hangout in Glendale outside of the senior center. Food- wise there are no surprises. Steakhouse prices for non steakhouse quality.  Hubby and daughter liked the lamb, done just the way they like.  my pork ribs were ok; a little on the dry side. Good g&t. Daughter loved the blackberry/ ginger mojito. Lunches are way better options than dinners and reasonably priced. Spending $180 on three meals here would have gone a long way at buying prime steak from Costco and a stellar meal prepared by me."}
{"text":"Hello moviemike going to our place for steak fix and fun times we go here because we never have a problem and great freindly service"}
{"text":"...trying to be understanding because it's Christmas, BUT.................
1) Great, welcoming host/hostess Team!
2) Awesome bar Team!
3) Steak consistently cooked to perfection (even my medium rare filet, thank you very much!)
3) But I have mixed feelings about Linda :(...from the beginning, she got impatient with our party of 8...when my elderly dad asked for a spoon for his coffee (he apparently asked again by the time I heard this convo) she said FIRMLY and IMPATIENTLY- but was still trying to control herself, \"I told you it's coming...\" I'm like, \"okkkkayyyyyy...\" (in my mind...so this was my xmas prez #1 to Linda, allowing her to get away with that at the BEGINNING of our meal, BEFORE ordering anything...
4) Then Linda then got snippy with my elderly mom when we were ordering our campfire special because the pairs didn't sit next to each other...UNDERSTANDABLE...this time my baby sister got to witness THAT car-crash of Linda losing patience, then KINDA controlling herself by acting polite (because she caught herself), then she started acting slightly inappropriate again. Xmas present #2 for Linda: me AND my sis letting her get away with THAT and us just looking at each other like, \"Is this for real?!\"
5) During the bulk of our holiday dinner, things were fairly normal until the check came...Linda came to our table 2x when we were still sorting our checks, and she tried SNEAKILY to rush us through our dessert. She couldn't control herself from saying that she's trying to hurry because she has another party waiting for our table - I honestly don't even know if she realized that she had said that out loud at first...but then I figured she did because she tried playing it off, and even said, \"I'm not trying to rush you ...\" and THIS is when the xmas presents from me stopped! I said, \"Yes you sure were. You flat out told us that you have people waiting on our table. You were rushing us.\" My bro-in-law tried to get me to be understanding about the whole thing. I understand that we spent a lot of money there...I understand that we are good tippers...I understand that people have choices to work or not work in the CUSTOMER SERVICE INDUSTRY on a busy night like Xmas Eve. I also understand customers choosing to go OR NOT TO GO to your establishment, or mayyybe even to a competitor for their holiday family gathering. Most of all, I truly understand needing to marry the fine balance of superb customer service and getting tables in and out- I've waited tables before and am still in the CUSTOMER SERVICE industry. 

THE SCALE TIPPED OVER HERE FOR ME- I saw Linda caring more about quantity over quality, and it backfired. She still got a fat $12 (20% ish) tip from me, and probably much more from my sisters - but what seemed to be her primary goal...and maybe it's Black Angus's primary goal that is taught in training: to turn over tables as quickly as possible! It was blatantly obvious and unacceptable. I felt rushed and disrespected. 

I want to give 2 stars because CUSTOMER SERVICE IS WHAT PEOPLE GO OUT TO DINNER FOR, but the other team members, from the when we walked in through the door, kick it up a notch (Emeril voice) to 3 stars! 

(Side bar: we went to Black Angus Arrowhead last Saturday and we had kick ass customer service! We didn't get the HURRY AND GET OUT BECAUSE I HAVE TO TURN OVER THIS TABLE feeling.)"}
{"text":"We had a drink at the bar, then dinner for my fiancee's birthday. The drinks were great, and the bartender was efficient and personable. Dinner was awesome, we had the teriyaki steak lettuce wraps for an appetizer and steaks for dinner. The food was fantastic, service was a little slow. However it was a Saturday night and busy, so that's probably why. We liked it overall, and would eat there again."}
{"text":"A accident happened off the 10 East offramp and I was very hungry. Fortunately Black Angus was nearby. I ordered Lobster and Prime rib which was delicious and Bartender was friendly. I also had a Black Angus Red Ale which was ok but somewhat bitter. Lobster tails were cooked great and steak was good. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. Prime rib tasted  cheap, like something from a $9.99 buffet, sides were obviously frozen, potato soup was Progresso, and generally not a really good meal. The food wasn't awful but I could have gone to Denny's and been more satisfied. The price is was too high for what you get."}
{"text":"First timers!  We had a wonderful experience.  The drinks were well prepared, the sides were delicious and the steaks were tender and perfectly cooked.  The service was also outstanding. I think the value for our money was excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"Under promised over delivered. As you enter in this restaurant you will be greeted by a friendly attendant who will as in our case take our name and send us into a very nice bar area to grab a drink while waiting for a table. As you look around you will enjoy flat screen tv's well made drinks and beautiful decor. The wait was much shorter than they told us which was nice. The waitress was warm and friendly and attentive. My drink never went dry as she kept refilling before I could finish it. She brought extra napkins and condiments without me having to ask which was great. The one weird thing was the food looked really bad but to my surprise my steak was cooked on the inside to perfection and tasted well seasoned and tender. Overall if you are looking for a delicious meal for a reasonable price I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile. Thought they were all gone. Always a nice place to get a good steak. Really enjoyed the coconut cream cake. Nikki was a good server."}
{"text":"About a year ago we had a bad experience here so we decided to give them another try after we received their flyer in the mail.

We started out with the sampler appetizer, for 13.99 I expected to see more than a 3 shrimp cocktail, hot wing chicken strips, deep fried zucchini and two burnt potato skins. 
I ordered the Sirloin (medium rare) and Prawns and my wife and daughter, ordered theirs.. after 50 minutes and several folks sitting down after us receiving their meals, I got a medium well steak- I sent mine back as did my daughter with the cold fries. After another 20 minutes, the fries and my steak came back, the steak was raw and after a couple of bites I pushed it aside, extremely disappointed.

Now I will say the manager Matt M. did come to our table right away upon learning that we were not happy with our food but he made it very apparent that he was more interested in 'solving the problem' than communicating with his customers. I asked him what happened so I could get a grasp as to what the issue was back there in the kitchen. His reply was short and he said he didn't know but, \"I'll just cover your bill\", then he walked away. His body gesture and attitude gave us the impression that we were just there for a free meal and he wanted to be done with the situation.

I contacted Black Angus' Chandler location and learned that Matt M is the general manger there that I spoke with that evening, so I contacted the corporate office through their website and was called back on Sunday night by a John something or other claiming he is the district manager, after I told him what had happened, he says that they have had a problem in the past with this location and that Matt is a really great manager, he also states that he does not want his management team to offer excuses and that he stands by Matt's way of handling the situation. He went on to say that he will be emailing me his contact information and to feel free to call him anytime. As of this writing I have not received any further communication from him.

There are a number of real steak houses in this region and I suggest you try them out instead. For the value Black Angus is too high priced for the quality and the service you're going to receive."}
{"text":"Never Disappoints

It has been quite some time since I last visited Black Angus Steakhouse.  However, today my sister and I were craving steak for lunch and Black Angus has the absolute best lunch specials when you have a hankering for steak.

Black Angus offers an extensive menu and well prepared food at a reasonable price.  The drink menu is great, and the beer is cold on tap.  We seldom have to wait very long for a table and food is served promptly.

On this visit my sister had a medium rare sirloin steak with grilled roasted corn and a loaded baked potato and raved about it. I had a filet mignon sandwich with grilled onions and roasted red peppers.  The filet mignon was the most tender steak I've ever had, as well as being flavorful, both cuts of meat were cooked to perfection, just as we had ordered them.  

Prior to our entr√©e we were served a small loaf of bread which was delicious and hot from the oven. The bread was hot, crusty, and soft on the inside.  I could have ate the entire loaf myself, but decided to share.  The deserts at Black Angus are to die for, however, we usually take ours home to enjoy later. 

Our server was amazing.  Once seated our drinks were served within a few minutes and we were given   a lunch discount card (8.99 for each lunch meal with the purchase of a drink) The Manager at Black Angus knows how to make the customer feel special. During most recent visit, the manager cleared plates,  assisted with getting our desert ready for leaving, and made sure our dining experience was a pleasant one.

We have never had a bad experience at Black Angus and plan to return every time we get the chance."}

{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here because of a gift card that we received for Christmas. We went on Saturday afternoon around 4 o'clock, and we were seated right away. It took awhile to get our drinks event though they didn't appear to be busy.

We ended up ordering the Campfire Feast for Two which includes an appetizer, two entrees and dessert. The appetizer we chose was the potato skins-- the portion on this appetizer was huge, it was 8 potato halves! The bacon and cheese wasn't put on proportionately so some had a ton of cheese and bacon while others had no bacon and only cheese, etc. You get the idea.

I got the filet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes and Caesar salad sides. The salad was okay, there were a few brown pieces of romaine that I ended up picking out but aside from that it was okay.

I asked for my steak to be cooked medium, and I was impressed that they did a good job cooking it to my liking and that garlic mashed potatoes were really good as well. These two items cheered me up from my less than stellar salad.

While we were leaving we noticed we were the youngest patrons at this restaurant by far which was kind of weird. I guess the snowbirds like this place. 

Overall: the food was okay but I would never go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"\"I know you can be overwhelmed, and you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be whelmed?\"

So sayeth the teenage movie, and so it is with Black Angus. Thoroughly and utterly whelming..

Let me start by saying the only truly aggravating thing was that they were out of 2 different kinds of red wine and there were maybe 4 glass choices to begin with. After the next one wasn't available by the glass I just kind of gave up and let my husband pick. 

My husband had the Prime Rib, Garlic Mash and Broccoli. I had the Bacon Blue Butter Ribeye, Loaded Baked Potato and Caesar Salad. We split the Crispy Garlic-Pepper Zucchini things and White Chocolate Cheesecake. At the risk of being redundant, if I don't specify something it was adequate. 

The Prime Rib 12 oz. had no crust on it. Zero. So it was basically a hunk o' roasted meat. The Garlic Mashed was not garlicky and texture was way off.

The Ribeye was thin. Like IHOP steak thin. 

The two stars is mostly because the price implies that something will be really good. And nothing was. For $100 (our meal plus tip) you get better quality, service and value at Outback, Yard House, etc. 

Thanks Black Angus! I now know what it is to be whelmed."}
{"text":"One of the hostesses needs training in customer service and an attitude adjustment.

A food courier asked \"Hostess A\" to check on an order because there was a mistake and the food courier was worried the order was going to go late. Hostess A checked, got the food courier her food, then Hostess B says \"sorry about that\" as the food courier left.

After the food courier was gone,

Hostess A says to Hostess B: \"don't say sorry!\"

Hostess B: \"but I feel bad for them.\"

Hostess A: \"Well I don't.\" and laughs about it....

Real classy and sympathetic.... laughing about somebody  being inconvenienced who MIGHT make $15/hr if they're lucky. In reality, that food courier makes minimum wage or even less if there is a problem that means the food courier has to wait.... A problem the food courier had no power over and no ability to fix. I'm talking $3 or $5 an hour when they have to wait, especially if it happens at multiple restaurants.

To that hostess who doesn't feel bad when stuff gets messed up and a food courier has to wait, just remember... that is YOUR customer's food that is arriving later than they expected. That is YOUR customer who is having a bad experience ordering from your business. That is YOUR customer who ordered from your business using that delivery service.

And here's the other thing: Every food courier is a potential customer (if they aren't already somebody who eats at your establishment).

FWIW, I will NEVER eat at this business after seeing how the hostess thinks about somebody who is just trying to make a few bucks on the side.

That hostess needs to understand that the couriers have no power over how that delivery service works and they are on the short end of the stick every time something goes wrong. You being cruel to them and unhelpful just makes things worse for your customer (and potentially drives other customers away).

If you really want to be angry at somebody, be angry at your management for accepting that delivery platform at their restaurant. The food courier didn't put that service in your establishment and if you realized how poorly compensated those couriers are (especially when something goes wrong), you might \"care\" for them, even if they aren't your customer at that very second.

After all, they might have been your customer previously, or in the future, or like in my case... NEVER because I don't frequent establishments with employees who talk bad of people who aren't there to defend themselves."}
{"text":"This is Black Angus.  You know what to expect here.  It's not elegant dining, but neither is it fast food.  It's generally simple fare done very well.

We each had steaks today.  They were good.  Black Angus usually gets the doneness correct (i.e. if you order 'medium', you actually get 'medium').  The steak soup is really a beef barley, and it's good.  The onion rings were good.  The au gratin potatoes were very good.  The wild rice was very good.

And the service was excellent (Brittany really paid attention...expect to leave a good tip if she's your server).

I've always like their booths, too.  Very high and well-padded, making them comfortable and relatively private.  You don't have to listen to conversations at the next table, nor can they really hear yours.

All in all a good place to come if you want \"meat and potatoes\" done very well."}
{"text":"Most folks probably are familiar with this place.  A western-style steakhouse.  A bit pricey, especially compared to some other steakhouses.  But the menu has a good range of choices (such as teriyaki sirloin, as well as filet and prime rib and NY strip, etc).  They also have a good selection of side dishes to choose from.

The food is very good.  And the service was very good also.  We sat in the bar, but that didn't seem to make any difference.  The server/bartender was properly attentive but not over the top.

You'll have a good experience here.  We don't come nearly as often as we used to because they are only open for dinner now, and usually we're not in this area at dinner time."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks, food and service! The steaks were cooked perfectly and the our waiter was friendly and had a great sense of humor. We will most definitely be returning. Also the deserts are off the hook!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 630pm.  because it was a Friday.  I understand a bit of a wait, no problem.   Where they sat us was a very small table.  No room for the dishes we ordered.  We normally get the Campfire but didn't this time because we knew that we couldn't fit all of the food dishes on the table.  Our waiter sucked.   Took our order, brought the salad and we asked for extra dressing.  We didn't get it until AFTER our dinners were brought to us.  I was drinking water and had to ask for more.  We spent more time waiting for things than we did anything else. 

My hubby and I love Black Angus but I think we will try a different Black Angus next time.   My husband and I were very disappointed."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice since moving to the area a few weeks ago.  Our food has been great both times.  I really like the teriyaki chicken breast.  They have great lunch specials.  Service has been good both times as well!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large party for a celebration dinner. Servers accomodated everyone with ease and promptness. I ordered the New York Strip medium with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I loved all of it. Normally steak is just steak, however this steak was juicy and nicely grilled on the outside. I loved the fried zucchni as an appetizer and the dessert was good as well. Nice time."}
{"text":"Only thing good about this place was our waiter. The food was bland! I cook better at home, seriously. I had the grilled chicken entree with steamed broccoli and western rice. The chicken had NO flavor. They could at least put a spice rub or something on it. Just throwing plain chicken on a grill and serving it is not worth $14.99. The broccoli was ok and the rice tasted like nothing. They didn't put anything on the rice either. It just tasted like plain boiled rice. I asked to get a different side, he brought out garlic mashed potatoes. Tasted like instant mashed potatoes with no garlic flavor at all. So, the food was crappy and the price was way too high for the low quality. No thanks, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Had prime rib and King crab legs.  Loved the prime rib.  Crab want bad I enjoyed it. On the fishy side.  So just avg.  Tough to eat s meal like tjat with water. Wish the had coke.  The gf sent back her bland sirlon and ended up with very fatty Ribeye. She said my prime rib tasted great just kind of salty. I admit I can like a little salt.   Salad was great cold plate and cold fork.  I'm gonna have to give these guys another try. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking at this place for a long time and finally decided to give it a try tonight.  She ordered the fillet w lobster tail, garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  I choose the 16oz porter house with baked potato and dinner salad.  Both steaks were very tough.  For the \"prime\" cuts of beef that they were said to be, these didn't come close to what you'd expect for a top quality steak house.  The dinner salad was close to frozen, the bread was very dry, the lobster tail was good, but nothing special.  The service was average.  All in all, we were sorely disappointed and I'm sure we won't return."}
{"text":"The steak was wonderful!!! Staff was pleasant and attentive...definitely be recommending this steakhouse !!"}
{"text":"Good apps, bar service. Always good cuts of steak and good service."}
{"text":"Hubby and I met here with a friend that lives in this area. The hostess was very nice and friendly and our server took great care of us. We had the campfire which is a great deal (specially with a coupon) an it is plenty of food for 3, even enough for leftovers.

Hubby and I shared a ribeye and our steaks were cooked exactly as ordered. The wedge salad was good, and the desserts were awesome. We had the big chocolate cake with ice cream... (molten chocolate cake?) and the seasonal white chocolate bread pudding, which is excellent.

We always get the sampler appetizer and I like the fried zucchini and the buffalo chicken strips. Their ranch is really light and very tasty. The molasses bread is delicious too."}
{"text":"Back again. You can never go wrong with the Campfire special, particularly when you have a coupon. ($39.99 for appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert)
Our favorite server Jenni was not in : (
Service was good, food was as expected : )"}
{"text":"We don't come here often anymore. Had a reminder this recent visit- PLEASE PROVIDE APPROPRIATE STEAK KNIVES! We couldn't cut our steak and it was just embarrassing that their provided steak knife would be more suited for cutting mashed potatoes (no joke) than anything. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"This place was just so-so for quite a while. Tonight was the best service from greeting to end. The food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Haven't gone here in a long time for dinner but ended up having a great time here! Usually the happy hour is what catches me but the dinner was just as eye-catching.
This is a great place to meet up with friends or a date because you can actually heat one another since the atmosphere isn't loud like most these days"}
{"text":"Throwing away all coupons for this place, I'd forgotten why we quit coming here, ordered prime rib med well, it was real rare, sliced so thin you could see through it, and had 9 pounds of fat on it, sat at the bar, only attention we ever got from her was when it was tip time. Would rather visit with her co workers, even the manager was visiting with them, and all inappropriate conversation, made us very uncomfortable, don't know how they will stay in business, rest of the food was as described by other customers, just plain awful,"}
{"text":"Was a little Leary about a chain for steak but was pleasantly surprised. We had a coupon for dinner for 2. Choice of appetizer to share, entree, 2 sides, and desert to share. The service was great, very attentive to detail. The steak was excellent. I had a wedge salad which could have been better but the rest of the dinner made up for it. The appetizer of fire grilled artichoke was really good. The broccoli side was good too. The desert was fine, could have been more choices, though."}
{"text":"So far so good!!!   This us our 1st time here, and everyone raved about this place. We have a favorite waitress here, Kelsey!!  The appetizer platter, the wheel, had a great variety of 4 different items, was superb! The house salad was a good portion and ice cold.  The steaks were not the best. We each had a different cut of steak, the sirloin was tough!, the rib eye was a thin cut and over cooked, the new York strip was decent, but not spectacular!   Maybe it was an off night???  We will come back but not for the steak!! The manager was gracious enough to take the sirloin off our tab. We appeared to be the youngest diners in our section."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good. Drinks were a little slow but they were awesome once they arrived. The prime rib was good, but the new york strip was superb! I recommend the chocolate martini or the black and tan to drink."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, I had Fish n Chips, my Wife had the Chicken Avacodo Bacon sandwich. Fish was Cod and was as good as I've had in recent memory, piping hot, fresh, and a large portion. My wife loved her sandwich, bacon was crispy and both entrees were priced right. Music was turned down and the Hostess seated us away from others so it was a pretty quiet environment. We're glad we went. Might hit it up for dinner as well."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment, both mine and my wifes steak were well under cooked, of course the waiter noticed mine right away and later came and took my wifes back. That completety ruins a meal when food is sent back. $60 tragedy.  Hadn't been to a Black Angus in years and won't be returning to this one. Too bad"}
{"text":"I was craving a perfectly cooked steak this entire week and this place hit the spot.  My family ended up taking me here for Father's Day.  The restaurant was clean and the service was fast and friendly.  We got sat down immediately.   The menu is a bit on the pricey side so we decided to order the feast for 2.  It was just enough for a family of 4.(wife and 2 small children)Which is a starter, choice of 2 entrees, and a dessert.  I chose the 12 oz. New York strip, medium rare.  Just melts in your mouth.  We all got full by the end of the meal.  We almost had to decline on dessert.  All in all, great place for steak if you don't mind forking out $85.00 for a meal for 2.  That's what took the star away."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner last friday night. It was our waiter Justin's first night (full disclosure, he told us he had restaurant management experience, so I think he was a ringer) and we had an excellent meal. 

Justin was spot on with his service level, checked on us with just the right frequency, refilled drinks almost before we needed them, asked plenty of questions to ensure we got what we wanted when we wanted it, then finished with the coup de gras - are you likely to come in for lunch? no? Then I won't impose on you with the lunch spiel. So appreciated!

Food was also spot on - a pleasant surprise considering I always seem to have issues with my meals at other steak houses. The filet was cooked perfectly, au gratin potatoes were delicious, huge wedge salad was served ice cold and Justin was back in seconds with extra dressing that I requested. BTW - a special thanks to whoever cooked my filet - it was perfect!!!  

Truly impressive! Kudos to all, including the manager for hiring Justin, he's going to be a great asset to your team!"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving Dinner Reservations for 6. They were packed but had it all under control. Some in our party ordered the turkey, others off the regular menu. Started with the spinach artichoke dip and fried zucchini . Amazing! The special was fabulous, turkey, stuffing, yams, mashed with gravy, broccoli, salad and pie. It was a first for us to eat out on Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"I have been to the Black Angus numerous times. This is an outstanding restaurant. The staff is great. They are always friendly, doesn't matter who is working, all are great. The food is EXCELLENT! Does not matter what you get, you can not go wrong. The manager is also such a nice person. She makes everyone feel welcome and encourages you to return and visit again. This is something I will do. This is my favorite place. Check out this awesome restaurant and bring the family."}
{"text":"Took my son and husband here on New Year's Eve for dinner. We had reservation, thankfully because they were overbooked with walk ins as well as reservations. We were seated within a few minutes of our reservation time. Our waiter was good, but could have paid alittle more attention to refills. The food was good, with the exception of the garlic mashed potatoes, which we found to be very bland. My filet was perfectly cooked, melted like butter in my mouth. Best part of the meal was thw white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. We will definetly come back soon."}
{"text":"My daughter went here and ordered the sampler platter and is highly allergic to shrimp she asked to subsitute it for something else and they said no.  They could put it on the side.  I called the manager and they said it is not cost effective for them to do this.  I called corporate and they said they do not do substitutions and they have no way to ensure there is no cross contamination with products people are allergic to.  This is a scary thought.  I work in a restaurant and there is away to do it.  Please if you have allergies or medical issues and you are not able to have certain items do NOT go to any Black Angus.  This is there company policy."}

{"text":"Wow. I rarely write reviews, and I was extremely impressed with my recent visit to Black Angus. The manager held the door for my wife and I, and he smiled as he welcomed us in. The hostess was extremely polite, and the servers were knowledgeable of the product, and even made some amazing recommendations (the potato soup is AMAZING). Our food was cooked perfectly and it was delicious and full of flavor. Finally, it was dessert time. Oh. My. God. The mud pie was one of the best desserts I have ever had, and tasted like it came from a bakery that specializes in desserts. I cannot wait to go back :D"}
{"text":"SAVE YOURSELF!!

Don't be lured in by the coupon you received!!

Truly awful steaks! Bad cuts, bad cooking!
Why did my steak taste like fuel?!
Why couldn't I cut it with my knife?!

Was that green thing with the oily white stuff a salad?"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE NEEDS A MINUS 1
because I so have a beef with this restaurant. My husband loves steak. usually I am not a huge fan of going to a steakhouse but it was my husbands turn to choose so I insisted we go. It is not that I do not like steak only that I often find I prefer the steaks I grill at home to the ones served  out. I do however lloooove the fried onions alot of the steak places have but this one did not have one. BOO! Anyhoo......we decided to order what was supposed to be garlic-peppered fried zucchinn. It was fried nicely and not too oily, but I did not taste garlic or any pepper in the seasoning. It came oddly with a cucumber dip (I think it was creamy cucumber dressing) we asked for ranch instead. It just tasted off. I ordered  a grilled chicken breast that was supposed to be seasoned with rosemary and spices well again, no rosemary. My chicken was dry and boring. I ate maybe half of it.It came with a side of broccoli and what was supposed to be GARLIC MASHED POTATOES also another popular side item at most steakhouses. AGAIN, nothing but bad to say about both these items. FIRST. Frozen cut broccoli should never be served  at any restaurant. I only eat fresh steamed broccoli.When you list on the menu fresh seasoned veg of the day I think it will be just that fresh. Next, garlic mashed potatoes. Anyone that loves these knows they are made with cream and garlic and should be creamy comforting goodness. These potatoes were like I nuked a potato dumped the  insides on my plate and smashed it with some butter and garlic salt. When I  asksed the server about them because I refused to eat them , she said \"oh yes no we don't make them that way here we leave out cream because people have allergies\" OMG! What a joke! CREAM is the best thing about em! what would be the point otherwise?I told them they should tell people this before they order. She asked me if I wanted a baked potato instead. I looked at her and said\" that is what I have all I need is to add sourcream\".(I don't think she liked me)  Oh but wait my husbands was no better. He ordered prime rib. They brought it out fully cooked! The server acted annoyed we complained about it.They brought out another piece- we waited another 20 for that and then they did not even offer to dicount our meal. In fact a manager never even came to talk to us even though I know the server did talk to him about our meal. Good service to me is even more important than food at times.I would NEVER GO BACK HERE. Mcdonalds would have tasted better. So I will be sticking with OUTBACK. At least they got the onion!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. I go often. The service is excellent, and the food is consistently great.  I could live off their wedge salad. It's so crisp and tasty. Get the coupons, you can find them everywhere and it will save you a lot.  The ambience is nice and quiet. My wife and I love the no rush romantic times. Steaks are great."}
{"text":"The molasses bread here is to die for as well a the fried zucchini.  While the happy hour selection is limited, the dishes are great!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the service sucked. The waitress barely said anything to us and not once asked if we would like a refill. We barely saw her the whole night. After spending a lot of money you would think we would have great service. Funny that the other customers around us seemed to have the waitresses always around but ours. We will not be back here again."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a couple months ago.  The service is sub par and the food is ok, but probably one of the best if you live on the west side.  Nothing special that will wow you.  Texas Roadhouse is far better food and service if craving a good steak and maybe even cheaper.  For similar atmosphere and way better service at the same price, I recommend The Keg.  A good try if you get the coupon in the mail.  I didn't use a coupon, because it was a last minute decision, but seen coupons in the mail all the time.  Oh, and they weren't busy to justify ok service."}
{"text":"We decided to give the restaurant many more shots after the last horrible experience and each one has been better then the last. We just sit at the bar now and the service is great. The Saturday night bartender is awesome and the food is many steps above that first experience."}
{"text":"Food and service was great I recommend this place to friends and family.  I had the ribs and chicken and my hubby had the filet mignon sandwich very delicious! Our server Jordan was right on point and very friendly.  
Will definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Prices are much higher than yesteryear. The prime rib is still very good and service is exceptional. If prices were more in line i would rate higher. Food seems to be consistently good. Fire grilled artichoke appetizer was really good!"}
{"text":"Well, last night was my last time ever eating at Black Angus. For the price of the food, you would think they'd have better quality! I ordered FRESH broccoli, and it was disgusting. There were brown spots on it, and it was steamed probably in a microwave, because it had a rubbery texture. My New York strip steak was medium, and I ordered it RARE. My fianc√© ordered the porterhouse pork chop, and it tasted awful! He barely ate 1/2 of it, and I had to chase the bite he gave me with water. Our server was ok- he never said anything every time we said 'thank you', which I thought was a little rude. Anyways, it hasn't been a pleasure, Black Angus, so I will no longer be a customer."}
{"text":"Maybe the worst meal and service I have had since coming to Phoenix area.  The waiter James thinks he is great but a real smart ass.  He belongs in a dive bar not a restaurant that is trying to serve good food.  Took drink order never asked if we wanted water.  I do say he had a lot of tables which help in his poor service.  If you tried to stop him for something he just keep on going.   Gave us desert menu took over 10 minutes to come get our order as are dining mates got there's and where done with it.  Food gets one star steak cooked right but did not look anything like a rib.   Was not very tasty really not our kind of place.  I think we will stay away.  Really bad way to treat customers"}
{"text":"We have never had a problem at this location until this past Sunday.

We sat down & I realized it was very hot inside the restaurant. Thinking maybe it was just the table we went to move to a cooler spot.

There wasn't a cooler spot so we asked to speak to the Mgr., Paul. We asked if the A/C was broken & Paul said it was set for 78.  
We asked if he could turn it down & he said no. 

We left & went to another restaurant where the temperature was set MUCH cooler!
Who wants to sit in a hot restaurant & eat hot food?

Not me. No wonder they are going under!"}
{"text":"I do not normally write posts about meals... But my dad, I and two sisters eat often at Black Angus in Arrowhead. We have not always had great service or the best care for our food that we had on our last visit.

Our server, James S. truly made our experience so fun! He was so attentive and really cared that we were satisfied with not only him but for Black Angus as a whole! 

He was funny, made sure we were completely happy, but did not seem to interrupt our conversations. Please make sure you keep James there, because our next visit we will be asking for him as our server."}
{"text":"The staff at the bar are very nice and do a great job to serve you. Ive come here a few times and the bar service is fast during the weekdays. Food is decent and my steaks were all cooked properly."}
{"text":"Just left this place. Had the worse service ever. We have gotten take out here about 6 times before and it was delicious. We decided to try dining in.  What a mistake!!! Love the restaurant and the food, the service was AWFUL!!! Worse waitress I ever had!! Took about 20 minutes to even come to our table. Gave her our whole entire order. It took about 20 minutes to get our potato skins. Came back asked my boyfriend what he ordered because she said she just scribbled our order real fast and couldn't read it. So at this point she hadn't even put our order in. Oh... I forgot to tell you we have a 2 year old with us. So basically a ticking time bomb.  So time is ticking. She maybe checked on us every 35 minutes or so after that. Told me at one time she was going to go get my salad. 35 minutes later it arrives.  Finally someone brought our food to the table. Several things completely wrong but we didn't want to say anything and make her more confused. Even his beer was the wrong beer.  It was insane!! She disappeared again so I told the bus boy can we have our check and our desert that we already ordered with the meal. 20 minutes later she shows up!! No check and actually asks us if we want desert. I said we already ordered it and we want it to go!! At this point my boyfriend took my daughter out to the car. I waited another 20 minutes she finally shows up!! Omg!!!   My boyfriend said she was high as a kite the moment he first saw here and said she was prob going outside to smoke some more.  Too bad cause we liked the ambiance of the place. Just wow!!!"}
{"text":"We had a celebration with about 30. People the patio was perfect we were extremely satisfied with the  amenities, the food and staff would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Have eaten here on several occasions.  Tonight we were seated in the bar area.  Our waiter spent more time catering to three other tables around us and ignoring us.  The manager was not any better.  He too, was catering to the other tables and nearly ran over me as we were leaving.  

My prime rib was not rare as requested and the baked potato was luke warm to say the least.  We sat in the booth with our purses on the table obviously ready to leave and it still took our waiter a very long time to get us our check.  I was ready to simply walk out.  Mostly likely, it was just an off night, however, the service and quality of my meal are going to make me think twice before I try this Black Angus again."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, food and ambience. Roy our server was attentive, great conversational along with excellent customer experience skills. It's been years since we visited and we are again delightfully surprised by the experience. Simply sublime!!!"}
{"text":"I never write bad reviews (this is my first) but this place is horrible!!! Worst service and even worse management! First of all this is the 5th chance we gave them to get our order right because we do enjoy their food. They are 0-5. Each time we just placed an order for pick up and \"EVERY\" time (no exaggeration) there was something missing from our order. Either the salad, the bread or the cheese cake we ordered each time. The first time they told us to come back and get our salads...well we live over 30 minutes away so they refunded our credit card. The second time the bread was missing...we just let it go. The 3rd time...our cheese cake was missing. Is this a joke? Nothing worse than thinking you are going to have a nice piece of cheesecake with a glass of wine after dinner only to find out...once again you paid for something they forgot to pack. The fourth time we learned our lesson and checked the bags before we left the restaurant. Yep...once again they forgot the cheesecake. They got our cheesecake...no apologies...we left. The last and final time we will ever go there was on Monday 9/18/17. We got there right when the Monday night Giants game started. Again we just wanted to place an order to go as always. It took about 15 minutes to get a drink order and place our food order. It took another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks. Right before half time (yep it took that long to get a to-go order) the manager on duty brought us our bags of food. I politely asked if he wouldn't mind checking to make sure everything was there as we had problems getting everything we ordered the last 4 times. He said \"I know everything is there because I packed it myself\" and was very adamant about it. He then started rattling off what was in each bag. When he was done my husband said where's the cheese cake. The manager then ran to the back to get our two pieces of cheesecake. He handed them to us explaining that the dessert order go to a different area of the the kitchen so that's why that happened. Again just excuses...no apologies. It took forever to get our food order, which was incomplete again, and we were never asked if we would like another drink while we waited. The least he could have done was take the cheesecake off our bill. If you want horrible service with an attitude this is the place for you. Everybody needs more training there especially management!"}
{"text":"Solid filet mignon sandwich.. YUMMI. 

Nice decor.  Good service.  Will go again for lunch.."}
{"text":"We just had a great meal, and Chara provided outstanding service as always. The meal is always great here!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for Saturday night got there a bit early stopped in at the bar to have a drink while we waited.Took a good 15 minutes to get my drink when I did get it however I didn't even receive a straw. ( there was maybe 5 other people at the rail) Finally sat down at the table my bf ordered another beer took over 15 minutes to receive it. Server was nothing special. Never checked back on us. Maybe 30 minutes after we ordered. Food was okay. Not the best that's for sure. We did like the appetizer the best out of everything...go figure. In my opinion sooooo NOT worth a 70.00 experience. First and last time ever coming. Maybe I'd had better luck with just happy hour"}
{"text":"First visit w my husband. We sat at the bar for dinner. Bartenders werent attentive. Food came quickly, however steak wasn't cook correctly. My drink was empty and no one ever asked me if I wanted another. Food was mediocre and price was way to high. They asked us how the food was at the END of the meal."}
{"text":"Service was excellent though I did not like the server calling me \"baby girl\". Food was average and a little over priced. Really like the large booths. The ladies restroom had a very bad sewer odor. You could smell it before you even opened the door. Not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"Prices are mid range$$$ Food was excellent ordered the prime rib Absoulutely mouth watering portion sizes were great definitely left with doggie bags service was top notch... Ill be returning in the near future....."}
{"text":"Lunch on Christmas Eve was great with my wife and mother-in-law. Just one problem our server did not seem to care to address the ASPARAGUS that is served with the inedible part still attached . Cooking 101 basic food preparation such as removing the the bark part of the asparagus should be known by their \"Cooks\", I don't think a \" Chef \" would serve asparagus like that. 2 stars now maybe 4.5 if we did not have the asparagus. The server should have addressed this problem with the \"cook\"."}
{"text":"Okay service and the baby back ribs were absolutely horrible.. They were so tough I could not cut them off the bone...Too much fat on them and very tough.  The worst thing is that I contacted Customer Service and no replay.."}
{"text":"GOOD...BUT NOT GREAT!!!
Had gift cards so decided to eat there today.  Service slooow.  Took forever to get a simple Burger King size burger and a small steak.  No great deals here.  Nothing special.  (yawn)  Will be back if we get more gift cards."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner tonight! I'm at the miserable point of too full because it was too good and I pigged out! 

We were seated quickly in a nice booth. The booths are comfy and high so makes it a nice private intimate date night since you can't hear the people around you. Deanna was our server and she was very nice and stayed on top of our refills even though we were drinking water like it was going out of style. 

We received a coupon in the mail so went in for the campfire feast for 2 that is an appetizer to share, 2 entrees, 4 sides, and dessert. We got the steakhouse nachos for appetizer that is incredible! Easily best nachos I have ever had with tons of toppings and meat. For the entrees we got tri tip and prime rib. Both were very good but I wish the au jus was better for my prime rib. That is typically the best part but it kinda tasted like a bland broth. But other than that everything was great. We were too full so we took a cheesecake home for dessert. 

Overall everything was super good! Food, service, and expert level full! Thank you black angus."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The steak was amazing cooked to perfection the service was outstanding. This place is best steakhouse in Arizona !!!"}
{"text":"Had my boyfriend's birthday dinner here and had a great time. Best Margaritas we've had in a very long time. Dinner was just as good. Food was prepared perfectly. The only thing I could say would be I wish our server would have been a little more enthusiastic with our service. But all and all it was a great meal."}
{"text":"The manager was in touch with me the following day after I had posted re my visit. He was most apologetic, and was more than happy to make things right by offering to send me a gift card (Just over the amount I had spent there) so I could return and give them another try. I definitely will be back, as the beef was the best I had enjoyed in a restaurant in a long time."}
{"text":"I have to say I was totally not impressed. We went here on a date expecting it to be a niece experience. The appetizers we got were full of grease you could see it dripping off as you picked them up. The steaks we got had a lot of fat on them as well. Needless to say the meal grossed us out so we didn't even finish it."}
{"text":"Went here tonight and was pleased. Food was yummy and a man even greeted us at the end asking about our time. I also loved that he held the door for us on the way out saying he hoped me we got home safe and to have a good night. Great entrance and exit and immediately I thought he deserves a  yelp. Had the New York steak and it was so yummy and also the fried zucchini is to die for!! Will be back many times."}
{"text":"Its 6:45pm on Thursday night and daughter and I are starving, I'm not in the mood for cooking and would like a steak, so happens there was a flier in the mail for Black Angus Campfire Feast for Two for 39.95. I told my daughter here is our mission, to get Black Angus have our dinner and be done in 50 mins to be on time to pick up son at his job. 

So off we went, we were seated right away. I clearly explained to my daughter how the campfire feast worked, but somewhere between talking to her and her looking at the menu she got carried away, so I got her back on track, and asked her what type of appetizer she would like, for me it didn't matter. 

She started us off with the wagon wheel sampler, which is perfect to share with 2, it's the best of everything, Shrimp Cocktail, fried garlic-pepper zucchini, buffalo chicken and loaded potato skins. Everything was great, I have to say my favorite where the zucchini, even though it was fried, it was lightly fried and not greasy, and the flavor was delish!

For my meal I ordered the 12oz ribeye a loaded baked potato and Caesar salad .
Lets start with the Caesar salad, omg the slices of parmesan cheese on this salad was amazing! I love parmesan cheese and this salad was not lacking in it! So very good!  My loaded potato wasn't really loaded, it had bacon cheese and sour cream, but more like a micro mini scoop of it, but it was better for me that way because even though I went all HAM on this dinner, I still need to watch what I eat.  The ribeye, it was cooked medium and still very pink, but it was flavorless it could have been hit with some salt & pepper before the grilling.

For the dessert we had the cookie and ice cream, my daughter really enjoyed that, I had a few bites, but honestly I was just full!  The chocolate chip cookie though did taste heavenly sweet! 

Our server was Rachel and she was awesome! We did make it out within 50 mins and I did make it in time to get my son from work, did I feel guilty for going out to eat, maybe for a brief moment when he was heating up his hot pockets in the microwave, but that passed away quickly .  ( I did take him to get food elsewhere I'm not heartless LOL)"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing Artichoke Appetizer.  My kids LOVE it.  I will always come back for that artichoke."}
{"text":"First time ever to a Black Angus. Kayla along with Alonzo, gave  terrific, attentive service. We ordered the Tri tip and pork chops. The Tri tip was overcooked, but they corrected it immediately and returned with a tender, juicy &  flavorful steak... with ALL the sides again to boot! That's the way you do it folks!!!  The pork chops right out the gate were so delicious and juicy. We NEVER expected such standards and were pleasantly surprised. Great job Black Angus team, we will see you soon! Thank you."}
{"text":"We ducked out and was hiding from Trick or Treaters on Halloween (even though we had 15 bags of freaking candy).  Great, we are going to be known as that house.  =(

We were surprised that they were getting packed!!  I guess we were not the only ones ducking.  he he he...  We were quoted a 15 min wait.  We were sat in 15 mins, so cool!  The server was friendly and helpful.  I show him my b-day coupon and he noted it down.  He came back with our drink orders quickly and then took our food order.  He was so attentive through the dinning experience.  

Loaded Potato Skins:  Ok, a little bland.
Top Sirloin Center-Cut:  It was good, the quality of the steak was ok.  
The two sides:  Western Wild Rice - Good    Au Grain Potato - Good, but a tad too salty for my taste

The 4 stars is because of the server, he surprised me with a warm cookie & ice cream.  He remember due to the coupon I showed him in the beginning.  That was so cool of him."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the deal is with Black Angus, the setting almost tries to present a higher class eating experience, although that fleeting ambience in their eyes justifies their prices.  We went last night, and I've been several times before because this tends to be a go to of the in-law's. 

(and because they were paying :) 

I've never been overly impressed by their food, and even prefer the kischy outback and lone star to them.  The meat tends to be bland and not better than I can get at an $13.95 special steakhouse. the difference is the same smaller cut of meat costs 21.99 at black angus.  The appetizers aren't bad but nothing I haven't seen some derivation of before.  the service wasn't bad, but nothing else really stood out to me, except the high prices.

if they want to treat me to a steak dinner, who am I to refuse, but you won't see me there of my own accord."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived at 6:15pm for our 30th wedding anniversary, Sunday, June 3rd. (They close at 9:00pm).Our daughter and her siblings bought an electronic $50 gift card for our anniversary gift.
We were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess who seated us in a booth on the upper level of the restaurant. There were other diners dining, however it wasn't too busy. Our waitress came over and took our drink order while we perused the menu. 
I had an electronic coupon for the campfire feast for two for $45. With that coupon, we were allowed to choose from 10 different entrees from steak, prime rib, chicken, shrimp,  salmon and a rack of pork ribs with two sides each, one appetizer to share (wagon wheel sampler is $2.00 extra) as are some of the more pricer cuts of steak and a shareable dessert is included; non alcoholic drinks are $2.99 each. I chose ice tea and my husband chose ice water. 
Our waitress was very friendly and her name was Rachel. (The same name of our daughter who bought us the gift card). She brought me out a separate cup of ice in addition to my ice tea on the refill because the ice melts faster due to the hotter weather outside.
My husband and I both ordered the prime rib cooked medium. I chose the house salad with ranch dressing and green beans with bacon for my two sides. 
My husband chose the green beans with bacon and a loaded baked potato with butter, sour cream, cheese and chives.
For the appetizer we chose the shrimp cocktail. There were 6 large prawns brought out on a miniature size mason jar with a side of cocktail sauce. My salad was served on a chilled plate, made up of an assortment of lettuce greens topped with grape tomatoes, red onion, cheese and croutons.  
Each dish brought to our table for us to enjoy was fresh, tasty, and prepared with quality ingredients, simply delightful. We enjoyed every bite. The prime rib was tender, juicy and succulent. It came with au jus and creamy horseradish sauce for dipping on the side. Their signature molasses bread pared with light, whipped creamy butter was brought out to our table for us to enjoy.
We loved the food, service was great and the restaurant was clean. It truly was a fine dining experience. We will return at a later date for another food adventure. Make sure you come with your appetite as you won't leave hungry--the portions are large."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  Reminds me of a lot of chains out there.  Service is decent but they love to upsell.  Steaks are boneless which is a pet peeve of mine.  Appetizers remind me of bar food or something at a bowling alley.  Combo platter was warm but not hot.  I only went here because of a promotion they sent me via mail.  I would spend more next time and just go to outback."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment. Haven't been here in years and probably won't go back. When we walked in there must have been 5 tables that still had dishes from earlier guests. Only 1 server for a big section.  Took a long time for food to come out and my chicken was dry and steak for other guest was overdone. Manager gave us free desert since food wasn't cooked properly which was nice but it didn't make up for the mediocre food and very slow service. Soon this staple restaurant has lost its touch."}
{"text":"This used to be #1 dining option for our family but it has gotten too expensive.  Food is good, something for everyone and huge portions.  

A hang out for Sun City residents so arrive early for dinner."}
{"text":"Lacy G is the best server ever! She made our dining experience absolutely exceptional. Make sure you sign up for reward program for coupons."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and we're seated right away. Our waitress Delaney was very pleasant and our drinks never were empty!  She was always smiling and made the environment family friendly. Food was great and portions were nice size."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch there today 5-18-15 the only thing my wife ate was potato soup within about an hour she was feeling nauseous and had stomach cramps  we got home and she vomited violently 3 or more times. 
We called the restaurant and spoke with a mgr Steve who defended the food and states food poisoning doesn't show up for at least 10 hours. ( maybe he is an expert). But I know symptoms can appear in as little as an hour. 
He offered a gift card, but why would we want a gift card for a restaurant we will never step foot in. 
I requested his mgr and he gave me a phone for corporate, we will see how that goes."}
{"text":"The steak was NOT medium it was more medium RARE and it just seemed watery. The baked potato seemed overdone and hard."}
{"text":"Ate thanksgiving dinner here.  For the $90 spent on dinner for two without booze, it should have been a lot better.  The steaks were tough despite being cooked the way we ordered.  Spinach artichoke dip wasn't good.  Broccoli as a side was a tree on my plate barely steamed.  I know they were busy for the holiday, but it should have been better."}
{"text":"Loved the service and the food. Our server Shelley was terrific. Always made sure we had what we needed.  Food was quality. Loved the grilled artichoke and shrimp cocktail.  We were celebrating my cousin's birthday and she brought him a fresh, hot, giant cookie to celebrate with.  My family had different cuts of steak and loved each type.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I have only eaten here once and we both loved it. The appetizer we ordered was the \" sampler \". It came with numerous items, 3 of which were so good and the included Buffalo wings, fried zucchini, and potato skins. The wings were great, zucchini was flawless ( not greasy AT ALL ) and potato skins were great. Great pre dinner food. The food came and it was as good as I have ever tried. Got the top sirloin and it came out just how I asked. As far as food goes, this place is on point. A must eat. Reason for the 4 stars is service could have been better. Our waitress was VERY forgetful. Forgot 3 or 4 times on stuff we wanted. Other than that, great place to eat. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really delicious high quality food. The shining star here is James our waiter. This guy cares about customer service, which is unfortunately rare these days. I cannot say enough nice things about this young man. He was pleasant, helpful, efficient, and had a professional appearance. 
And yeah the steak and shrimp were terrific, and that cheese cake at the end was top notch. 
Good work, black angus and James. We shall return.

{"text":"Personally this is my favorite Steakhouse to go to. I had stopped going here years ago because this restaurant had gone downhill. About 6 months ago my parents decided to take us all there for a family dinner and wow I was surprised! We all had the best meal we'd ever had in a very long time. Unfortunately on my last visit, my husband's steak was mostly fat and gristle which highly surprised me because we hadn't had a meal there that we did not like. He didn't want to send it back or complain ,  which he should have because I know they would have rectified it. The service was wonderful everyone was friendly. We will still eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and served quickly. Had the campfire feast for two which included an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert. We got the filet mignon nachos for the appetizer and the New York strip and ribeye for the two entrees. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and was juicy and tender. Everything was delicious. The servers were friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Ive only been here twice but this steakhouse is good a little overpriced though but it still has great steaks, id rather go to longhorn still."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for the $17.99 mixed grill trio.  Outstanding value and customer service was top notch.  First time I have ever tried the Angus sirloin and it was tender by cutting with the grain"}
{"text":"A little concerning when there's only a few cars in the parking lot, this should have been my first red flag. Server was nice enough,  place was clean (since that's really all there was to do with 3 tables of people). My boyfriend ordered the prime rib with crab legs, he was happy with his order. Personally,  I thought his prime rib was a little salty. I ordered a sirloin that looked almost boiled,  but was not seasoned and tasted beefy.  Our Server was nice and exchanged it for a rib eye. It looked soooo much better but again beefy tasting, and SUPER fatty. Very disappointing!  The manager came over again, I explained that although this was better it's still not great because it's really fatty and beefy in flavor, he apologized and said he would adjust the bill. When we got the bill, he took 15% off and went back to the bar he was sitting at when we walked in. I will not be coming back, absolutely lost a customer."}
{"text":"I had a great time here with my family. Food was so good. We had New York steaks with loaded baked potatoes and we got cheese cake for dessert. Everything was so yummy. Also our server Selwa was awesome!"}
{"text":"It's is unfortunate Black Angus used to be a really top shelf restaurant back in the day and my wife and I decided to spend it there for Valentine's Day however you can definitely see the quality has dropped the prices and cocktails have risen though. A Fleming's it is not or Ruth Chris  but if you are looking for a good steak and a decent price try Texas Roadhouse.

My wife and I returned with a gift card and an apology from management, and the service was much better the food was good I am changing my rating because of their acknowledgement and the willingness to do better."}
{"text":"Although the restaurant is rather expensive, I have to say the service and food is exceptional. We were seated rather quickly and the waitress provided water immediately. The warm bread was moist on the inside and the outside had a slight crunch. The appetizer was brought out rather quickly and the waitress specifically asked if we would like to have dinners put in after she brought out salads. Waitress was exceptional. Steaks were perfect medium well not burnt or mooing. Plenty of food even took home leftovers. Great conversation, great food, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"It is definitely worth it to join the prime club. They have an amazing campfire feast for 2 and it is delicious With the prime club you save like $15. We have eaten here several times and the last two times have happily gotten Richard as our server. He is a very good server. Brings refills automatically and does well with the spacing between courses. The only issue we have is that their meat is always a little under what is requested so you may not get it quite the way you want it. We enjoy the atmosphere and the food is quite good overall. We will be back."}
{"text":"We visit Arizona 2-4x per year and always want a good steak. This particular Black Angus is usually the one we go to because the food is pretty decent. They have a very good menu, offering something for everyone, reasonable prices, and the service is usually good. This review is mostly for the appearance of the restaurant itself. Upon entering, it just looks DIRTY!!  Carpet is just plain filthy looking, and booths and tables look like they need a thorough cleaning. Menus feel sticky and just dirty as well. If these issues were addressed, it would be a really great place overall. All this being said, we will likely return as the location to Sun City, Glendale, Peoria areas is excellent and the food is good."}
{"text":"We ordered the Campfire combo with the shrimp cocktail and salads with the Prime Rib. The salad was very good with fresh greens and chilled well. The shrimp was pretty large and the sauce was very good. The prime rib was very good cooked just right and juicy with the right seasoning. We had the cheesecake for dessert and it was pretty large and very creamy. Management came by to check at our table as well as others. Service was good and there was a crowd waiting, suggest you make reservations just in case."}
{"text":"It's a nice change from some of the other steak houses. I enjoy the privacy booths immensely especially when I don't want to here other people's conversations. The steaks are good and not bad prices."}
{"text":"Steak and breaded shrimp, loaded potato. Nice staff, quiet environment. Best part were the silver haired couple dining across from us that talked to us about my tattoo, but most importantly about his experience in Vietnam, and his heartfelt discussion. Wish I had gotten a pic. Sweet. But he told us(after we discussed the horrible treatment of the vets), \"Don't forget us.\" And I thought wow. 
My memory is more so of him, then the restaurant.

Oh, and warning~ skip the coconut pie.!!! Awful and it's nearly 7.00 ~ crazy."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Black Angus to celebrate our 40th Anniversary.  (we had been there twice in the past). Like in other reviews, I was tired about the other chains. We got the Campfire Special. Without  a coupon it was $59.00. This included an appetizer to share, 2 entrees, 4 sides and a dessert to Share. We got the Artichokes, yummy! The old man got a huge rack of ribs. I have never seen that amount anywhere including Barbeque places. They were delicious. I nabbed a little taste. I ordered the filet . It came as ordered medium rare. (anybody that orders a steak well done is wasting money). We each had a salad, and I had a loaded  baked potato, while my spouse had the onion rings. For dessert we got the New York style cheese cake, Then they threw in a huge chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla ice-cream.  

We had Many leftovers which will feed us for at least 2 other meals.
Our server was Hannah. She was great. Very attentive, she kept checking on us, and removed the dirty  plates quickly. That is one of my pet peeves to have used plates on the table.

We arrived at 5:30. By the time we left the place was packed. There was an hour wait time was an hour. I would recommend getting a reservation if you plan on dining after 6."}
{"text":"We went here the other night.. waited about 25 minutes to be seated which isn't too bad.. our server was great.. but we were totally disappointed with the food.. steaks were cooked to order but they were bland.. my bf had a baked potato and French fries.. fries were not seasoned.. baked potato run of the mill.. I had a side salad and Brussels sprouts with mine.. salad was ok.. Brussels sprouts were bland and unseasoned.. we both also got lobster tails.. both of which were majorly overcooked and just did not taste good.. gave 2 stars only cuz our server was awesome.. we will not be going back here"}
{"text":"Always good. Mom and I go here for lunch and get the half sandwich, salad and fries for 9.99. Great fries!  Great ice cold salad. Grilled chicken, avocado and bacon sandwich is excellent."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! Lovely dinner and server. Food is delicious a bit pricy but overall great customer service."}
{"text":"I buy better cuts of meat at frys. The steak wasn't seasoned and had no taste. The mac and cheese was watery and didn't taste anything like cheese."}
{"text":"I came here on Valentine's Day to try their happy hour for the first time (All Day Sundays). Our bartender Misty was great and she was the best thing about our dining experience. 

We ordered the steak quesadilla and it was terrible. It was really greasy, it seems like they used cheap oily cheese and a very thin flour tortilla causing all the oils from the cheese and meat to seep through. Had to use a fork to eat it, after two bites I could not eat any more of it, just too much grease. Also we were given brown guacamole and damp transparent lettuce ($6 HH). The jumbp shrimp cocktail ($6 HH) was 6 small rubbery shrimps that did not look appetizing at all. My man ate them cause he didn't want to complain on such a busy night. 

Misty did a great job with our drinks and have no complaints there, they do have some great deals on drinks for HH. We did not complain that night because of how busy they were, but the manager is the one that delivered both of our dishes and he should have seen at least how bad that quesadilla dish looked. And he never came by to ask how things were."}
{"text":"Ok family steak house. Good deal on lunch for the $7.99 anything on the menu but service can be a bit slow. The server with the handle bar moustache is A-OK. he did a good job we got out just in the nick of time to make our 2:20 movie. 
Thanks handle bar moustache dude!"}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars anything, but from the moment we called to make a reservation and came in yesterday, everything was just perfect.
The hostess that made the reservation for me on Friday, was very courteous and helpful, they greeted us promptly when we came in on Sunday and seated us immediately.
The waitress, sorry, didn't look at the name tag, was super friendly and quick and attentive.
We went there to celebrate husbands birthday and had an email coupon for signing up online. 
We first started out with the house salad for the guys and I had the Caesar Salad. Big plates, very well chilled and the fork to eat it with was also ice cold, didn't expect that  at all and was a great way to start out. The only \"complaint\" I would have is the Dark Molasses Bread, there was just not enough of it. It was awesome and I could eat just the Bread. Lol.
We all three ordered the 16oz Rib-eyes. I ordered mine medium, my guys did medium-rare. This was the first time in I can't remember how long we had gone to any steakhouse and actually had the steaks cooked to perfection. Mine was topped with the Garlic Herb Butter, which added a delicious flavor without being overpowering. The Baked Potato for me was just the right size and my husband devoured his Au Gratin Potatoes and my Son went simple with the Mashed Potatoes.
When we were finished with our Meal the waitress brought out a hot Chocolate Chip cookie with Vanilla Ice Cream and a lit candle to help us celebrate. As stuffed as we were, we did manage to find room to finish it off. We didn't want to be rude.....hahaha.
Overall, this was a great visit, one we plan on repeating many more times. Sorry Outback, but you lost us tonight and Welcome Black Angus. You are outstanding."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Steak was cooked perfectly, staff was very friendly, service was great. Had to move to another booth because the customer in the booth next to us had such bad breath we could smell it. Whats wrong with people? Seriously. Anyhow the waitress was very accomodating to our needs."}
{"text":"This place definitely cured my steak craving! First time visiting here and went with the 2 for $59 deal.. left stuffed to the gills and happy as could be! Service was on point and we found no lag in attention! Quality and quantity were met!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the drink I ordered. The cost was 10.75. Okay but I didn't ask for a special whisky at a cost of an extra 1.50. Bar whisky would have been fine.  I blame this on the waitress as she didn't ask. I would have said the Crown Royal is not necessary. The steak was perfect. If you want a good steak they do have a great one."}
{"text":"I don't mind a wrong order, if the steak was overdone or they forgot my tea. Let's see how I'd do in a restaurant! However, a rude or condescending server, in this case the manager is when I have very little tolerance. I got very sick from the food I had there, I even had to go to an urgent care clinic that night. It turned out to be food poisoning after eating something bad! After calling the manager the next morning to bring it to his attention, I was appalled by his response, his tone and his lack of empathy to my concern. He was completely dismissive and even assured I got sick elsewhere. I know exactly what got me sick, the only thing I had earlier that day was a cup of black coffee. That is why we decided to have early dinner there, I was hungry and did not want to wait to get home. I will never go back and I strongly encourage to be cautious if you go, I am still fighting the infection. I will never be back, just the thought makes me feel even worse."}
{"text":"The food was really good! My husband and I ate here on New Years eve . We had the campfire feast for two. It came with a lot of food for about $60 . The staff was very nice. I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars , because the service was a little slow to be not that busy and it was a little pricey. Besides that we loved the food and will be back."}
{"text":"First time in years since i ate here and now i know why!! Ordered steak and it was hard as rubber plus cole slaw which was tasteless, couple drinks and bill came to over 80, totally a rid off for a cheap tasteless meal!!!"}
{"text":"We received some of the best service we have ever had here! Our server Lisa was so nice and the gal knows her football! The food was great (I had the prime rib) and everything was served quickly."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of the old Black Angus. It was old school done perfectly. I eagerly awaited the reopening.... and was very disappointed.  One of two things are going to be true:

1. Black Angus is going to try and become a nouveau chic steak house in which case they have a VERY long way to go and likely will end up becoming an \"everything for everyone\" option for canyon creek, slowly loosing staff and clients until they disappear. 

2. They become a steak house. 

Let's hope for #2 because one can only go to la Castile so many times. 

Here's a free tip. Lose the \"old world offering\" and give me back my pickles!

{"text":"Good old-fashioned family steakhouse. Steaks and prime rib cooked perfectly to order, very good sides, huge dinner salads. Very attentive waitstaff, almost too attentive. Interestingly, this place has a huge bar area adjacent which has its own yelp review area! The fact that this place can survive with two larger chain steakhouses within walking distance is a testimony to the quality of its food."}
{"text":"I'm not a black angus fan but my girlfriend is so i tag along,
Here are a few of my observations:
Pro's
Girls at the front desk were great and efficient
The waiter was helpful and courteous
Good ceasar salad

Cons
Price...  7.25 for a margarita and 11.00 for a 6 shrimp cocktail ??
Burger and fries 13.00?
My girlfriends filet was small

In the end...there are better values out there for sure. I dropped 60.00 on dinner and had a burger , fries and water. 13.00
My girls dinner was 47.00 !
Just imagine if i ordered an appetizer and had a drink as well !  80.00 + No thanks!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here tonight. Kudos to the chef for cooking our steaks perfectly and especially kudos to our wonderful waitress Tarin  (hope the spelling is correct ), she knew just when we needed her, was very knowledgeable about the food and was simply a perfect waitress. Thank you."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinner at Black Angus this evening. Nice quiet atmosphere, stellar service from Aaron.  Food was outstanding. Prime rib and salmon cooked to perfection.  Wedge salad was scrumptious.  We had our New York cheesecake boxed to go.  A lovely evening to top off a great weekend."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a coupon and the food was amazing!! Our server was named 'Roy' and he was fabulous. It was a great night out !"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Received coupons in the mail so we had the campfire feast!! So much food we had to take most home. Our waiter was very nice and friendly, he was being shadowed and that gentleman was very nice and friendly also. Can't say enough about the food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Cleanest  food place I've been in awhile. Food was ok the steaks of all 3 of us were cooked properly. The service was very good."}
{"text":"I did go mainly because the coupon I got by mail. The coupon served it purpose! 

Starting from dark warm bread (YES), then to the appetizer (we had the home made potato chips) and finally to our main course. I ordered the prime rib eye with salad and cream spinach. The taste was good, not covered with annoying sauces or similar. To finish we had the desert included, but we had to take that home as it was too much. 

It is not that cheap for students budget, but once in a while it is good to have a good steak."}
{"text":"This is my first time at a steakhouse and let me tell ya, it was delicious! I got the New York 12 oz steak, mac n cheese, and a loaded baked potato.  Got my steak medium rare and it was beyond my expectations. We had the 2/$45 coupon that we got in the mail today. Bill total was $53.xx We got an Avalanche smoothie, i don't recommend that, watery and the smoothie was parting from the melted ice now water in the bottom of the cup.  Also it didn't seem to busy on a Wednesday night yet there was a really long wait.  30 minutes to get our waitress to get our drink order in. And another 30+ min for our food.  And then our waitress left right after she gave us the bill, but we paid with card to get the 7% cash back on yelp so we walked to the front where a guy assisted us.  So with the cash back we payed about $49. Would go back just for the delicious steak.  Just wait time for food was crazy.  We also called ahead to make a reservation so we only waited a couple minutes to get seated before other people who were waiting at the restaurant before us. Hehe."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service we've ever experienced in a restaurant. The woman who waited on us was rude, disrespectful and unhelpful. Servers, their black shirts wrinkled, untucked and dirty looking, stood around chatting among themselves, totally ignoring customers. When we finally managed to flag down our own waitress to request water (a request we made for the umpteenth time) and a refill of our iced tea, she was miffed, turning and walking away as we were speaking. Ignored me, barked at my wife. Got the water and one refill, but that was it (and we felt lucky). No more refills of anything. The lone exception to this behavior was a young blonde lady in white who was pressed into service delivering our plates, apparently at the behest of the rude waitress; she was pleasant and saved me from burning my hand on the hot plate as I reached for it. (Thank you!) The food was OK to good, but in truth the ambiance of this iconic brand was completely destroyed, as was any semblance of a nice dining experience away from hearth and home, leaving customers like us feeling unwelcome and as though they were intruding. Whoever owns this particular place has work to do _ unless he or she enjoys losing money. No matter how much people revere Black Angus, word of mouth will spell doom for this restaurant until things improve. But it had better happen sooner than later."}
{"text":"I'm from Pennsylvania, being here in Arizona one disappointing thing was steaks were mediocre .
But Black Angus is up there with the Best, me and a friend each had bone-in Ribeye. This was the best steak I have had here in the last three years.
Also got free lobster tail. Service was great  and everyone very friendly.
I'm already planning my next trip back to Black Angus."}
{"text":"I find the quality at Black Angus to be superior over all similarly priced steakhouses.  The servers are pros as well."}
{"text":"Just was at the joint, asked for a steak sandwich, rare.  I got salt and grizzle.  I refused it. Don't ever go there if you want good food."}
{"text":"Love Black Angus and this is the location in my neighborhood.  Anytime we go the place is nice and comfortable, good service, great food....a nice place to have dinner."}
{"text":"The meat is always cooked just the way I like it! I like the New York strip, medium well (no, I don't want the cow to moo at me) and the fries are wonderful especially with ranch! The grilled asparagus!! It's always a quick service and welcoming smiles. It's not very expensive and perfect whenever you're feeling steak but don't want to break a few bones!"}
{"text":"I went here with some family members on Sunday (2-11-2018) for dinner. We asked for a table of 7 for 4 adults and 3 children. We were told the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes. There were quite a few people there waiting so we were not surprised by the wait.

After about 30 minutes went by everyone else had been seated. It was getting later and there was no longer a wait to seated. But still we waited. After 10 more minutes I asked the hostess if a table would be available for us soon. She spoke with a harsh attitude and said that she had warned me that it would be a long wait.

We sat there for 20 more minutes as several more parties arrived without reservations and were immediately seated, including a party of 6 large adults. There were quite a few open tables by now as things were really slowing down. There were several empty 4 seated tables next to each other that could easily have been pushed together.

But the hostesses didn't care and obviously didn't want to seat us. I don't know if it was because of the race of some members of our party or because we had small children. But it was clear that they didn't want out business. They didn't care that one member of our party was 89 years old or that one was a pregnant woman. They made zero effort to accommodate us or even to speak to us.

Do not go to this restaurant unless you are a Caucasian snowbird. That seems to be the only clientele that they want to serve."}
{"text":"I had eaten here a couple years ago and it was decent food and service. I think the place has gone downhill. When you walk into a place that is empty I'm a Friday night, be afraid. Prime rib was way overcooked and fatty. Veggies were mushy. I was wearing nice jeans and a blouse and I felt overdressed compared to other patrons.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I went there the Monday after New Years.  They did not know that it was a holiday.Only 3 servers on duty.  Wait for attention at the table for attention was very long, then while the young lady was trying hard, the food service was very long and the burger that I had was terrible.  Dry, overcooked and no sauce on it at all.  I ordered a French Dip to take home and onion rings instead of FF.  I paid extra for the onion rings.  When I got home there was no dip for the French Dip, and only 4 onion rings.  
Needless to say it will be many years before I go back.
R.M."}
{"text":"Contrary to the other reviews, there was a crowd waiting at the door at noon. Despite this, we were seated promptly.  
We initially chose this restaurant because of a coupon in the newspaper. We got 1/2 pound prime rib, a dozen shrimp and 2 sides (I chose the garden salad very crisp and garlic mash). The food was satisfactory, but wasn't worth any more than the coupon price.
They have a great selection of draft beers (I had the Sam Adams Boston Lager). I would recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"I had the Wagonwheel platter and it was soo good.  The waiter was on top of our order and the food was wonderful.  They made it a special day when the day wasn't all that special.  We will definitely be back.
Thank you so much"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years. Came to take advantage of the streak/lobster/shrimp special and it did not disappoint. With veggies and a loaded baked potato it was more than enough food. My companion's Sriracha butter steak was more tender than my sirloin. The lobster was as small as I expected but tasty and the shrimp were perfect. Had a cowboy cocktail with rye and Kailua and WOW. Glad I wasn't driving. Overall, a fun and tasty evening"}
{"text":"I usually don't like giving 3 stars or less..  But I honestly don't think this place deserves more than 2 stars!  Went there over the weekend with group of friends (5 people).  Okay.. I will just cut to the chase.  50 mins to get dinner.  Asked multiple times for refill.   Another 20 mins to pay.   $20 for 12 oz ribeye with 2 sides, and it wasn't that great!  I can get better service and better tasting steak for less at Texas road house.  This explains why lot of their locations are out of business..  Maybe they should change their name to \"Black Anus\".. LOL! Okay that was little rude!"}
{"text":"Was really craving a steak.  Hadn't had one in a looong while.  Choose the honey garlic/glaze new york strip steak w/fries and a salad. Absolutely amazing and cooked exactly how I asked.  Great service, good dinner & fun experience with the family!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:20 & was seated, noticed the place was not as busy as usual. We asked the young lady who sat us if it was still happy hour and she replied that yes it was until 7. We asked her if there was a happy hour menu and as she walked away she said, \"there might be ask your server.\" So it started off poorly.

Amanda was our waitress, and she was quick to get to our table and pleasant to speak with. She was familiar with the menu and specials. We placed our order at 6:40. (2) Wednesday prime rib meals, one child's cheeseburger meal, and garlic cheese bread to be served with dinner. Sides selected were loaded soups and loaded potatoes. 

At 6:45 the soups were brought and as always a tasty choice. 

At 6:54 the cheese bread was brought to our table by another kitchen staff member, dropped off rather hastily so that we did not have a chance to tell him it was supposed to be served with dinner.  We covered it with a napkin to keep it warm to enjoy with the steak.
 

7:02 kids are getting restless for food....


7:05 food arrived! My prime rib was tender and had good flavor. However my man's prime rib was not so great. Amanda offered a new plate which was appreciated and prepared quickly. The new steak was better, but not the way it has been in the past. Maybe a bad lot of meat or something. The Heinz 58 and A1 steak sauce would have been nice but it was forgotten until we had already finished most of the steak. 

Amanda is a good waitress overall, the employee seating people and the food was the problem."}
{"text":"Came for the first time with some friends. This place is great for anyone going out with the family or out on a dinner date. Our server was great very attentive and a great attitude! 
But I do have to say I'm a Texas Roadhouse lover till the end lol and the food at black angus is very similar to it, but Texas Roadhouse has bigger portions for less money (and better bread) lol. Black Angus really does have the best chocolate chip cowboy cookie though! Definitely recommend if you're thinking about desert"}
{"text":"We decided to give the Black Angus a lunch try and we pleasantly surprised how good the lunch soup & sandwich was. It has been a while since we were there and the new manager(?) has stepped it up a notch from our last visit. The service was a little slow and sloppy, but this was a late lunch and they were setting up for dinner. My steak soup was  good, and the half sandwich ok, but my wife's potato soup was top notch. She really liked her sandwich and I would have traded her, but she wasn't going for it. Yes, we will try another and glad to see the change for the better at the Black Angus."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since we ate at Black Angus and first time in AZ. 

Great dining experience. We were across from a VERY loud family and were reseated promptly . 

The manager was wonderful understanding. The server did a wonderful job which enhanced our date.

The only hiccup was a overcooked steak that was promptly taken care of!  

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND  BLACK ANGUS.  It is a comfortable place with people who want to ensure your experience will EXCEED your expectations"}
{"text":"Came in with a coupon so we got the $27.99 meal for $22.  Yo  u get to choose your appetizer, so we chose the sampler which is excellent.  I want their chicken fingers recipe it was sooo good.
Then we each got salads:  one gigantic Caeser salad for my friend and coleslaw for me--very fresh both of them.  Yum yum to this.
Now the entree:  Both of us got strip steaks.  I have no idea what my friends was like, but the meat on mine was so tough and filled with gristle that you could have made shoe soles from it.  Not so good...even the taste was just ok.  I am pretty positive they had been frozen and then thawed, so not as fresh tasting either.  Very bad here.
2 sides each, so I picked a fully loaded potato  along with the cole slaw.  The potato--altho very small--was really loaded and great.
And for dessert we could chose one dessert, and we chose the carrot cake which we both liked.  Maybe no so good as my own recipe but very good.
All in all, a decent meal...but I ate only half of my steak and gnawed down the rest of it the next day for lunch.  It's just poor quality meat is all.  No way around that one.


And how was the service?  OK..no complaints there either.

Black Angus needs to upgrade either their meat or their prices so they can purchase higher quality meats."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is not good or the cooks just had an awful night - The server Amanda was fine and I still left her $10 on a $40 tab because she didn't cook the food .. The steakhouse bacon cheeseburger was over cooked and so dry I found myself searching for more ranch to dip it in. The fries were nothing more than grocery store frozen fries u put in the oven and there was an after taste w everything that often comes when places cross use frying oil w seafood and apps - Not pleasant!

My daughter's kids meal .. The grilled chicken looked good but had absolutely no taste and the mashed potatoes were so bad; the best way I can describe is when I tried to mix them up for her, the potatoes moved as one unit, you could tell they were old. I think they forgot her fruit too; I wasn't gonna make a big deal about it or seek a manager but no return visit for us. The bread and butter were the highlight of our daddy/daughter date ngt. 

Overall, seasoning was a huge miss; everything was super bland and seemed old/stale. Maybe it was my mistake ordering a burger from a \"steak\" place but they missed the mark on both meals badly."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks 
Moscow peach mule
And nacho supreme
Friendly wait staff and bartender and gm"}
{"text":"We've eaten at this restaurant a number of times before, including on special occasions.  I looked at reviews here and on Google ahead of time and saw a contrast between those who loved it and those who hated it. I had never looked at reviews before.

In the past we came for dinner and had a large special like the campfire, this time it was for lunch. The waitress was Rebecca. She was quite attentive, checking on us regularly, friendly, clearing the table quickly when needed and meeting any request. 

This dinner was for Valentines Day, but we avoid eating at a restaurant on the holiday itself to avoid the crowds. This was two days later on a quiet day, the way we like it. This place is set up for quiet and privacy at each table, one reason that makes it attractive. 

The food was served hot, paced well, and my chicken and loaded potato was excellent. My wives steak was good but a bit overcooked. The Caesar salads were good. The bread had been served promptly without asking. We left full, satisfied and pleased. 

The ambiance is Southwest, cowboy pictures, sports bar, soft country music piped in. 
This chain is a kind of Arizona tradition. 

We'll continue coming here in the future."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long time and on a whim decided to go since we wanted a giant steak plus some good sides. Our waitress was  very helpful and nice. The food was decent but I felt was alittle overpriced for the portions. The grilled artichokes were my favorite the sauces weren't very good but with some lemon it was great"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! My filet mignon was perfectly cooked. My strawberry lemon drop was tasty. Appetizer platter was standard barfood. Carrot cake was good and the campfire feast was a pretty good value."}
{"text":"Love this location! The staff are always so friendly! Love the campfire specials with the dinner for 2 coupon!!! They gave us extra ice cream for our dessert! Never get sick of this place. On weekdays seems like a ghost town, but packed on the weekends! Glad to see that since I would never want them to go out of business! Love it!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. Wife and I had a 50 dollar gift card and usually we dread chains but hey we thought we could do dinner on the cheap...

With tip ( 20%) we spend another 50. 100 bucks total

We got the single app, 2 entrees, and desert. 

The sampler platter app came. One of the shorn still had a vein and the food was just bland. 

My steak was cooked well but the meat was so poor in quality. The broccoli was embarrassing. Definitely frozen before cooking. You can just tell

The service was great but they should be ashamed of the food!

STAY AWAY FROM CHAINS"}
{"text":"I flew in from Philly, so by the time I got to my hotel, my body thought it was 10:30 and I didn't have dinner yet. There weren't many options for dinner, and olive garden wasn't going to cut it, so I came here. (long preface...I know)

Drink to start: corona with a lime...easy right? The lime was stale and fell apart as I pushed it into the bottle. Next...glass of BV cab '09 - better, but the glass had major water marks on it.

I got a 6 oz filet with broccoli. I was pleasantly surprised, although the knife handle was broken. The \"wood\" was snapped at the bottom.

The server was friendly and attentive. He called me sir at the end of every sentence, which made it awkward. Once or twice is okay, but 60 times in one hour is a bit much."}
{"text":"Agree wit previous review. This place needs a minus star. We went in and waited about an hour before we got our food. By the the kids were done so we asked them to box it instead which took another 1/2 hour. This place is worthless. I can't even remember if the food was good because I was so angry at the service!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went on our Anniversary.  Reservations for 7pm.  Salad was dismal.  Took forever to get non alcoholic drinks.  Prime rib was dry and not a good cut.  Garlic mashed potatoes were a joke.  More like dry wall paste.  Never, ever again.  For the money we spent there are a LOT better options just right up the road."}
{"text":"We spent a family anniversary here and the staff was amazing helping us celebrate!! Ask for Hanna she was wonderful!! Had a great night."}
{"text":"By far the worst Black Angus I have EVER gone to! After waiting like 15 minutes for our drinks, we placed our order which we waited another 45 minutes for I found a disgusting curly hair in my baked potato. I was so grossed out and mad at this point that I didn't even want to eat. What a disappointing experience, never coming back here."}
{"text":"I came here to order some Wagon Wheel Platters for a work luncheon. Great service. Love their food!"}
{"text":"Great bar. Lots of tv's for sports. Fantastic Steaks!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we came here and it was absolutely delish, the steak was cooked exactly like I wanted and the flavors paired wonderfully and also the lobster tail so much flavor. They did not disappoint and the sever was on point!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here probably once or twice a month and the food is always great. Steaks come out perfectly, delicious sides and different liqueurs to suit any taste. However the last two times we have had Linda as our server and we will be sure never to have her again. She has no personal skills, doesn't offer her knowledge of the menu to help you decided on what you want, and is extremely slow. Patricia and Keith were always around and offered their help whenever we needed it. Keith in particular has a great personality and next time I hope to have him as our server. 

TL;DR: great food and drinks. Ask for Patricia or Keith to be your server when you go."}
{"text":"I went to Black Angus for dinner last night. I wasn't expecting gourmet food from a chain steakhouse, but the food was disappointing. I had the 12 oz ribeye and 9oz lobster tail. 

I started with a margarita, which was good. The complimentary bread tasted fine. 
Next my salad arrived. It was okay, although overdressed for my taste, I should have asked for dressing on the side. The baked potato tasted good although it was barely warm inside. 

The steak was just ok. I've had better ribeyes from Fry's grocery store. Even for that cut, there was a lot of gristle and connective tissue. 

The lobster tail was not good quality. And the reason for a 1 star vs 2 star review. The meat was mushy in areas. The taste was rather bland, not sweet. And half way through I noticed it had a faint sketchy odor. Both Red Lobster and even Sizzler's lobster tastes much better than the poor quality lobster tail I got from Black Angus. It was a waste of money."}
{"text":"Awesome place and the steak was great
But the most amaizing thing was the customer service 
They really did took care of us
Love it"}
{"text":"I have not been to a Black Angus in over 15 years at least. I was pleasantly surprised. The service was great! The food was  very good at a decent price with the Campfire for two coupon. There were no restrictions using the coupon so my New York strip was a good portion and cooked perfectly. All and all a good experience and we will be going back"}
{"text":"We like this place the food is always good and the
service is great. Go to the bar for happy hour and
order appetizers."}
{"text":"Asked for a medium steak and it was nearly well done. Service was fair. Vegetables were good. Cocktails, although pricey Were decent"}
{"text":"I generally disregard chain restaurants and in the past I haven't had much good luck with black angus. This was truly the exception. We had a gift card so we had to use it and we're so surprised. Service was impeccable. Eva was great and management was courteous as well. Food was really good. Honey mustard chicken sandwich fish and chips and kids sliders all were excellent. We will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Four of us went for dinner at this Black Angus. As an old time steakhouse, they have the cooking of their meats down to a science and can cook anything exactly as ordered.

The restaurant started us out with a molasses oat bread which was tasty, but tiny. It reminded me of a large muffin more than a loaf of bread. It was served with nice soft butter, which we all agreed would have been better had it been a good salt butter. 

Two of us started of with salads. I had the honey mustard and companion had the ranch. The salads were tasty, but needed to be cut into much smaller pieces, as I am not accustomed to having to use a knife on my greens.

Companion and I ordered the Tri Tip. While it did not resemble any Tri Tip I have ever eaten, it was flavorful and cooked perfectly. 

Our table companions both ordered the Rib Eye Steak. In looking at the plates, I was sure that what they received was prime rib. It's hard to mistake the look of a true Rib Eye for that of Prime Rib.  We all had baked potatoes which arrived smothered in butter as requested.

Only one of our party wanted dessert, and ordered the Mud Cake. It was pronounced decent, but not terrific.

The restrooms were reasonably clean as was the carpet in the restaurant.

3 stars for properly cooked and seasoned meat even if it did not look like the proper cuts, good service and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant for a Mother's Day dinner, the service and food was great...But the MUSIC well for a dining out experience and not a fast food or family diner type restaurant was Awful..Loud heavy metal and rap type NOT WHAT YOU'D EXPECT FOR A STEAKHOUSE atmosphere??????????"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here a few times and had a couple of different things. We like the food And I've had a good experience every time we've been here. The service is good and well everything is good I wouldn't say anything in particular is great, but in fairness I do tend a great place is fairly hard and my expectations for what they are and what I pay or take into consideration."}
{"text":"I am absolutely certain Black Angus will soon become a West Toronto landmark. The decor exceptional. The kitchen is an aesthetically solid. The vibe was perfect with a great cross section of clientele. Unfortunately I can't comment on the food, as after waiting two hours for our main course, we had to leave. That said, they were genuinely apologetic and comp'd our drinks and apps. 

In fairness, it was day 3 since opening, and I actually felt bad for the managers, as I'm sure we weren't the only train wreck of the night. All said, I will return, probably frequently, once they get things worked out."}
{"text":"So I am on this calorie counting diet that works everytime for me.  Problem is not many places have the calories on the menu.  Well my cousin told me that Black Angus did, so here I am writing a review.  I cant even tell you the last time I have been to a Black Angus but it was a pretty good experience.  The calories for each entree was only on the lunch menu but that worked for me at the time.  I know that restaurants that have more than 20 locations have to start following his new guideline and I cant wait because I people need to be able to at least make better choices when they want to.  Enough preaching.....The atmosphere was nice, very clean (this is awesome for the metro area), the decor was comforting and most seats felt private with high seats, the service was great, and the food....well, i didn't order a ribeye like I would have at a high end steak house so just move on to the next review.  I had the teriyaki chicken breast (think it was 280 calories) with wild rice (350 calories but I only ate half), and the steak soup (120 calories believe it or not).  I figure I had a good size lunch for about 700 calories including drink.  Not bad at all and the whole meal was pretty good.  Cost me almost $20 with tip but its not like I went to McDonald's for lunch, right?"}
{"text":"Finally reopened after the original was bought, then redone, then burned down.  They have done an incredible job on the inside decor and layout.  Definitely invested a lot in this much larger space. The prices are very fair which I'm sure will change and slowly get raised once they build their client base. Unfortunately the food across the board is average at best. The old fashioneds were below par, onion soup was ok, rib steak was ok, the flowerless chocolate cake wasn't good. Will probably return and try something different."}
{"text":"Awesome prices and a huge menu. Something for everyone. My steak came out perfect. The prime rib nacho appetizer is a meal in its self. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My new favorite steak house! The fried zucchini melted in your mouth. If you have kids that don't like veggies, they will probably eat them. My steak was cooked to perfection. I haven't had a steak this good in a long time. Love, love, love this place.  I believe you get what you pay for and this place is worth every penny. Even had two trainees waiting on me and they were awesome. Great job Roy!"}
{"text":"I've been to many locations and this is the better one! Everything was great the food the service all of it! The manager even stopped by to ask how everything was and joke a little that's great service!"}
{"text":"You must get the loaded bake potatoes soup. Best I've ever had!!

Black Angus is one of my favorite restaurants. They only have a few in Arizona so I take every chance I get to eat there. The appetizers, drinks, and entrees are great. The service at this specific Black Angus was also superb. Very friendly and quick. We were there for lunch so I believe he understood we had a time limit. The booths are nice and big so it is a great place for a big party."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger and a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Good food and I like that they participate in rewards network. My only issue is the pour for their drinks. Very small and must be metered or the bartenders are told to pour small drinks. No worth the visit for the bar."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location well over 25 year and this place is still a great place to eat a great Prim Rib dinner.  Service is always top notch.  Their bread is incredible and not to mention their Caesar salads.  They are huge and so good!  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Just got back from Valentine's Day dinner with my wife. Haven't been here in 2 months but last time was great with Brandon as our waiter. THIS TIME WAS POOR!!! Waitress Sarah, poor attitude and very forgetful, acted like she really didn't care. After our dinner, I pulled out a coupon for free dessert for joining their club and was told they would NOT except it because it's Valentine's Day....they are only excepting the Birthday coupon for free dinner. When I told the waitress that the coupon has NO MENTION OF ANY RESTRICTIONS and only expiration date she asked manager and I was told WE ARE NOT TAKING IT. Needless to say....False advertising and POOR ETHICS comes to mind! The manager didn't even have the courtesy / courage to come by and apologize. POOR MANAGEMENT! I don't know if we will be back. I have my own business and I WOULD NEVER HAVE COUPONS CIRCULATING AND NOT HONOR THEM!!!!"}
{"text":"When we first arrived the host seated us next to the only other people in the whole place. So close to the other people I felt I was sitting at their table. Not sure why I was seated next to them so close. I got up and asked to be seated elsewhere. The host accommodated me and sat us on the other side of the booth we were at. Which was much much better. 

My New York steak was great. Cooked medium. Pink through and nice and juicy. 

The mash potatoes had no flavor. My wife's medium prime rib was way too cold and pink. Her stomach hurt all night. 

The artichoke dip was burned. Couldn't really eat the dip because it was infused to the dish. 

My long island tea was great! Not too much ice like other places. 

All in all I left happy and satisfied. Just imagined the food would have more flavor for the price and was irritated my wife got a stomach ache. 

Left spending $89 for two."}
{"text":"We love black Angus. Come here all the time. Service is great. Food is always good. We use coupons and it's very reasonable."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of ordering a pound of prime rib from here. It was 31 bucks, I ordered it medium rare, the color was right. The taste and toughness were not. The au jus sauce was warm at best which even if that had been hot would have helped a lot since my prime rib was cold in about 3-4 minutes from hitting my table. Not sure if it's just this location or what but I would stay away from this one and Black Angus, you should get your prime rib fixed quick or close that location. For now I'll go to places that only have prime rib on the weekends which tells the customer that it's fresh while it's here. Not \"fake news fresh\" like Black Angus'"}
{"text":"Ate here for a family birthday and I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was very good and the customer service was excellent!  Our waitress Dani kept our glasses full and brought several rounds of delicious bread.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. No discounts for seniors or military. But a 15% discount is applied if you are a AAA member. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went there for the first time tonight for our anniversary. Food and service were great. Their margarita was fabulous. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"The great thing about this particular black Angus is that the bar is normally empty and you can't get better customer Service then If you're sitting at the bar All you need to do is order a drink ask for a full Menu and of course ask what their specials are for that day recommendations are prime rib full cut be careful when you're ordering off the specials menu especially if you're ordering lobster tail if your lady likes lobster tail Have her order the tenderloin and lobster tail but not off the special day just strictly because it's only two dollars more and the lobster tail on the specials menu is a 4 ounce and on the regular menu it's a 8+ So you know you may be able to get a couple of bites great service great menu what more can you ask for you go UC set the bar"}
{"text":"Just your run-of-the-mil Black Angus chain steakhouses. I was in town for the weekend and met up with my family at B.A. We've been to B.A. before at different locations so nothing was foreign to us.

We ordered the campfire feast, which includes two dinners for two adults with an appetizer and desert for $40. I ordered the chicken and rib plate, my daughter ate the ribs which was 1/4 rack. I had the chicken, it was okay, a little plain. I should have stuck to my staple when I go there, the teriyaki steak. I like their baked potato soup, it's normally tasty. 

I've noticed that the quality in Black Angus has significantly declined in the last 15 years. It used to be that you were able to order a steak plate and the steak was bigger than the broccoli spear it's accompanied with. Now, not so much, they serve mini steaks. 

My biggest gripe with my experience at this particular restaurant was our waitress, she was super rude. She came to our table, rudely asked us what we wanted to drink, and started taking the menu's away before we had a chance to look at them. She was slow to get our drinks and food but she sure was quick to pick up our food (even though we weren't done with it). We had to tell her not to take our plate, she saw we were still working on our plates, so I'm not sure what the hell was wrong with her. When the bill came she must have lingered around our table to see how much tip she was getting. She quickly picked up the bill before we were done, which is rude. We must have asked for extras like napkins and to go boxes without her acknowledging it. Killer part is that the restaurant wasn't even busy. I'd say 0 for effort."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now (always when family comes into town) and have yet to have something that wasn't delicious. Usually I go with the Prime Rib which is absolutely on-point! You have a choice of two sides from an expansive menu with everything from baked potatoes to salads to soup. 

It's definitely more on the pricey side, but totally worth it if you are looking for great steak and a nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is always a good time! Pretty pricey but my belly is full and I am always happy when I leave. They have a great baked potato soup, that I have to get every time I come here. It warms my soul! LOVE IT! After a bowl of soup for my appetizer I usually order a steak, loaded potatoes, chicken........ seafood... you name it they have it. The service is a little slow at times, but I have never been unhappy with my food. The steak is nice and tender, the chicken is nice and moist and their chocolate chip cookie with ice cream....... mmmmmmmm! I really never have room for it, but I cant say no, so I make room! HAHA! Keep it up Black Angus! Mmmm Mmmmm good!"}
{"text":"Went here on Sat 2-13-16.. Was able to be seated quickly. Waited a bit for our salads but that was expected the night before Valentines day. The check came and took an extended time to get my card back."}
{"text":"It has been years since we've frequented a Black Angus because it had really gone down in terms of quality, quantity, and overall service.  Well we decided to give this location a try (it wasn't here when we gave up on the brand) and were pleasantly surprised.  First and foremost, Madilynn was an awesome server! Very attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu.  The food was really good and they didn't serve skimpy portions, which was how we remembered the Black Angus of years ago.  The restaurant itself was comfortable although they initially tried to seat our family of five at a table for four, which I hate, but they corrected it when asked and the booth we ended up in was quite comfortable.  Overall a good dining experience and I guess they've gotten their brand removed from my blackball list."}
{"text":"Friday night meal
I ordered delivery from DoorDash at Black Angus. Food was incredibly well cooked. I got a prime rib sandwich. The bread was dry so I pulled it off and ate only the prime rib, peppers and onions. Everything was tasty. The prime rib was perfectly cooked medium rate. The New York cheesecake with strawberry sauce was decadent. The single strawberry was not ripe. The DoorDash delivery was 60 minutes as per the estimate. Four stars, minus 1 star for the bread. .I would order this again. Maybe without the bread."}
{"text":"I always like their steaks here. The sampler platter is good and their food is consistant. We have always had good service.  They are easily better than outback steak house."}
{"text":"A coupon that arrived in the mail made us think about a nice Fillet Mignon to celebrate a finished work project. My wife and I were disappointed to learn that we could not substitute a Fillet Mignon for the New York strip even though we were willing to pay more. So that meant no prawns with our steak. We informed our waitress that the only reason we were there is because of the coupon in the mail. Well, the tall seat backs in the booths is another reason, but without the coupon showing up we'd be eating left over veggie soup from our fridge. The waitress was very kind and understanding. She asked her manager and she gave us the bad news. He politely said no and was attentive enough to talk to us and say no right to our faces lol. I guess it's a strict policy and even the manager could not bend the rule. So my lack of stars is for Black Angus corporate. How hard is it to just cook a different steak and add $5 dollars? I guess it's impossible. 
As far as service it was ok. Not great that I got my steak 5 minutes before my wine. But sounds like I should feel lucky to get my food quickly after reading other reviews. 
We did end up ordering fillets, just paid normal price and did not want expensive prawns. A fine glass of red wine, superb baked potato with perfectly cooked Fillet Mignons is certainly worth 2 stars. But my wife may wait another year before returning."}
{"text":"I'm giving 1 star because of what happened while waiting for our table tonight 3/24/18. We were right next to the host stand. While waiting I over hear a server is apparently having a rough night. And she didn't want to take another table at that time. I've been in the industry for almost 10 years we all have rough nights. But to the older hostess and the bald manager with the soul patch on his face and blue dress shirt, shame on you two! I also heard you two talking about being understaffed tonight. So slamming one server with more than she can handle is wrong on your part. And very unprofessional to be talking like that in front of guest. After taryn got our drinks everything was great! Thank you taryn for you great service tonight!! I wish I got the hostess and managers names so corporate can look into it but we got there around 8pm so it shouldn't be hard to track them down. Taryn I hope you got my message and thank you again!"}
{"text":"Food was great!
Service was wonderful,  Brooke delivered the food right at the perfect time for each course. Water glass was full at all times. Never rushed!"}
{"text":"A party of 4.  3 had great meals, 1 was cold food, manager replaced it.I think their coupon program is krap. They way they charge you on the check you can't tell if it all adds up without a calculator.   Figured it out later & it didn't. Not worth going back for."}
{"text":"There were some good things about our visit here and some just o.k. things.

The food is good-New York Strips were cooked as ordered and son's burger was good.  There is a good variety of side choices and the side wedge salad I had was tasty.  Service was solid as well-attentive waitress (Liz) and everything moved quickly.

The not-as-good...the restaurant is dated and has kind of a musty feel to it.   Also, the prices were high-$13.50 for a Cheeseburger and decent sides for instance.

A decent chain steakhouse where the entrees are on par with or maybe slightly better than Outback."}
{"text":"Order a steak medium well and when it came it was not cooked enough when the waitress brought the food she ask if we wanted to cut into the steak to see if it was cooked right. So she sent it back and to cook some more when it came back it was cook to the point that it was not eatable. I let the manager know what happened and she took it off the bill. Thank you for the customer service."}
{"text":"Ack! Another instance where I truly should have checked the reviews first. What a mistake it was to set foot in this place.

First and foremost, for a Thursday night, it took an inordinate amount of time to get a table for two. We ended up getting a nice booth, the big one directly across from the bar, right off the entrance. Pluses and minuses (comfy and fairly private, but lots of cross traffic with people hanging at the bar until their table was ready). It looked promising at the outset because our server was tending bar and we were in the one and only booth visible from the bar. It's literally four feet from the bar counter and line of sight to the bartender. 

Unfortunately, looks didn't materialize into actual service. We waited far too long, probably ten minutes, before being approached to place our initial drink orders. No apology of course for the wait. Then we place our drink orders and proceed to wait another 10 minutes until they actually arrive. Again, no apology. At that point we ordered our entrees and appetizer, as well as finally being asked (why this long?) if we also want bread. Considering we were about 20 minutes in with nothing to show for it, after a 20+ minute wait to get a table, yeah, something edible might be nice. Why wasn't this brought out with the drinks? 

That brings me to the first food-related gripe. The bread was completely and utterly tasteless. I mean not just bland but totally lacking flavor. How do you even manage that with wheat bread that has oats on the outside? It should at least taste of something, but I couldn't taste anything at all. Oats? Wheat? Honey? Nope. You could butter it up all you wanted, but then all you taste is literally the butter. This was like putting butter on cardboard, and that's being generous. Between all the waiting, we actually got not one, not two but three of these mini loaves of bread. They were all equally terrible, so it was not a fluke.

Next was the appetizer, which was another complete let down. We made the mistake of trying their spinach dip. This stuff was borderline inedible, it was actually that bad. Over heated, scalding hot, nasty texture, bizarre aftertaste and horrible flavor profile. Spinach and artichoke were two things you could physically see in it, but at the same time you couldn't taste them at all. I won't say I'm an aficionado, but I am a huge fan of spinach dip and I order it just about everywhere I go that has it on the menu. Having said that, this was, bar none, the absolute worst, and by a huge margin. Simply disgusting. And to make matters worse, the chips were completely unsalted and also old and stale! They tasted about as flavorless and were just as reminiscent of cardboard as the bread was. How do you screw up tortilla chips? 

As part of my entree, I ordered their \"steak soup\" as a side, which came out next. I had high hopes, and was of course still famished at this point, seeing as how everything up to this point was basically a huge disappointment. Sadly, this soup only added to the list. Firstly, it was bland and lacked flavor (noticing a pattern?) and, secondly, it had this bizarre odor and accompanying aftertaste that was somewhere between bouillon cubes and lentil soup. Whatever it was, it only made an already uninspiring, pitiful excuse for a soup even less desirable than it already was. 

The entrees eventually showed up, and once again, a huge let down. My wife's teriyaki chicken had some chunks of sauce that were literally (no lie!) as thick as grape jelly, and her side of green beans looked like something that came out of a microwave after a few too many minutes -mushy, lifeless, tasteless and just plain gross. In my case, having ordered the crispy shrimp, I was shocked to find that for twenty bucks, I ended up with less than 10 shrimp, all smaller than my thumb (inclusive of breading)! The breading was some cheap, tasteless mess, with no real seasoning and on par with what you'd get at a fast food style seafood place. The other side, which came out with the shrimp, was the mac and cheese. Surprise surprise, this was also underwhelming. While the bread crumbs and seasoning on top had some flavor, quite good actually, the microscopic macaroni itself was, again, bland and flavorless. it added insult to injury that it wasn't very warm and basically looked and tasted like something that was made several days ago and (poorly) reheated.

Normally I wouldn't hold food quality against a place so much if they at least had good service and tried to take care of us, but that didn't happen either. Our server was terrible. As I said, she was at the bar and within a few feet of the table. Still, our drinks were always empty for long stretches. Never got asked if the food was okay. Never noticed the appetizer was rejected. Didn't clear dishes until the end of our meal, by which time I had built the pyramids of Giza in the center of the table.

Unbelievably sup-bar and ridiculously overpriced. Never again."}
{"text":"Been here dozens of times throughout the years and have always been happy with the food and service from this location. Some of the waiters have been here for years and its good to see them around when I come to visit they always provide great service. Also always seated immediately and I don't ever recall a time when I have had to wait extremely long at this location. I will continue coming back to eat here if you haven't been here yet you should!"}
{"text":"It was just OK and I was hoping for better since I ordered the large, more expensive filet.  It wasn't any better than any other cut of steak as far as I could tell.  The baked potato, salad and bread were good as was the waitress but I'm going to look for another steak place."}
{"text":"Took my family out last night, and the food was excellent. I ordered steak, mashed potatoes, broccoli and the tea with raspberry and mango. Everything came out just right. 
The steak was well done like, I asked for. The mashed potatoes and broccoli was cooked just right as well. My fiance enjoy his steak, loaded potato and shrimp. My son had the sampler platter, with no complaints. The price was well worth it and I left a 18% tip as well. Our waitress was very good and patience with us."}
{"text":"This was one of my least favorite dining experiences. My ribeye was tough, under seasoned, generally tasteless, the green beans were under cooked and sprinkled with a couple of bacon bits? My wife said her salmon was also over cooked & tasteless! The salads were good, and service was good, but we agreed the food was not worth the price & we will not return!"}
{"text":"Food was good ! Service was pretty fast ! I would go again .make sure you call to see whAt time they close don't ever go right b4 closing everything will be rushed"}
{"text":"I wanted something different so I try the steaks and lobster it was good but I came in to late 11pm it cost about 80$"}
{"text":"My family and I just finished a FABULOUS meal at Black Angus in Mesa. The steaks were cooked to perfection! The waitress Judith was excellent!"}
{"text":"Hi, I wrote a review last night, a one star, under Eppie A, I didn't think the steak was worth $25 due to all the fat and gristle on the meat, had a word with manager, was not a very nice experience, turns out he was filling in and doesn't work there! What a difference  a day makes, left my visa there,lcalled to find out, was there, went in and met Wendy who does work there, she asked me about last night and was going to contact me, told her about experience, she said they don't operate that way asked if she could make it better. I would have been happy with a $5 discount last night, Wendy gave me a gift card for $25 and asked me to come back and give them another chance! I really appreciated her and their concern. 
I definitely appreciated her genuine concern, will definitely keep going back!"}
{"text":"The menu was horrible. The salad choice consisted of two. Woopdido. The garlic cheese bread was horrible - flavorless, no taste of garlic whatsoever and that horribly bland cheap Mexican cheese, that they attempted to dress up with tiny green flakes of something. The cheese was thin and flat.  Tasteless.  There was not one pasta choice. The steak prices were high for just a steak and I don't eat meat.  Did it ever occur to them that not everyone in a group eats meat and they ought to have at least a few other items on the menu?  And I don't mean deep fried sea food - what a way to destroy good seafood.  I can't comment on the quality of the steak because I didn't have it but, everything else was a huge disappointment.  The molasses bread that comes with the entrees was alright but, nothing to write home about.  It was still 100% refined.  They had to put molasses in it to give it flavor.  I don't care to go to a restaurant to be served garbage.  My expectation is to be served a change from what I usually eat but, not lowered in quality - either equal or surpassed. This place is obviously serving the cheapest food it can buy.  That might explain why the place was almost empty on a Sunday evening."}
{"text":"Got here at 4:45, got seated right away, STILL don't have our food (it's 6:05). Even if the food is amazing (apps were decent but chips were stale) I'll never be back again with this long of a wait for food."}
{"text":"Decided to try Black Angus after not coming for years. That was our first mistake. Waited 15-20 min to order and this place has The Keg prices for Denny's quality food but at least at Denny's their attentive and cheap! Next time you want to spend $20 a plate skip this place for sure! $70 bill for 2 plates and 2 drinks and we couldn't even stomach our food. I wish I was one to complain because if this was a product I would have returned for full refund!"}
{"text":"We recently ate at the Black Angus on Hampton for the first time, and not sure if we would go back.   My wife ordered the filet while I ordered a strip.  We both ordered baked potato and were told they did not have any.  Next choice was mashed potatoes which came to us only slightly warm, lumpy and very dry. My wife said her filet was good, but mine was over cooked.  The waitress did not come by and ask if everything was good.  We finished our meal and while we were waiting for our check the couple next to us got their meal - steak and BAKED POTATO!  What the hell!!!!  We finally got our check and overhead the lady next to us send her steak back.  The manager brought her steak back to her, so my wife got his attention and asked about the baked potato.  He said they were out for a brief time but had more in the oven.  We asked why couldn't the waitress have told us that, we would have opted to wait for another table until they had baked potatoes again.  All we got was blah, blah, blah.  Then we told him we had been waiting 15 minutes for the waitress to pick up our check, so he took it and the waitress brought it back.  No apologies.   Would have had a better meal and experience at Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight. Service was not great. Bread was cold and hard, not warm and soft. Burger was overcooked and quite dry. Not a stellar experience. Had to reflect poor service in her tip, only left min tip  
UPDATE:  Trying this location again to see if things changed. Perhaps just an off night last time.   Stay tuned.    So this visit was MUCH better.  Better service.  Better food.  Changing rating as well."}
{"text":"Even sitting in the booth next to Sheriff Joe didn't make this place get past the \"uh\" stage.   

Everything was average. Food was very basic and standard fare. Steaks were tender but not as good as they should have been for the price, $20.99 for a 8oz tenderloin, $18.99 for a 6oz. Service was fine. 

Would I go back? Probably not, unless there were few other options available."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch, thinking it would be quiet and would get prompt service....at 2pm in the middle of the week, it was FULL of older folks (a sea of white hair throughout...) WTH?!

I was meeting my mom for lunch, so it was too late to get up and go someplace else (that was more reasonable and not as busy).

$10 + change for a grilled chicken breast + 2 sides...no beverage included. Overpriced for lunch. No complaints about the food, it was just average.

Of course, there was a coupon circulating out there that the Sun City bunch must had known about...$7.50 for lunch, including a beverage. Shame on me for being too dumb to eat here without a coupon and for be willing to shell out an almost $11 bucks per entree...

Because it was so busy (at 2pm in the afternoon!), my Food Server was friendly, but so RUSHED...it also took way longer than average for our salads and food to arrive.  Very disappointing!!! :0(

SUMMARY: Overpriced, slow service.

I will cross this place off my list...won't ever eat here ever again."}
{"text":"I don't eat out for steak very often, but for a no frills, no fuss place (on my birthday) this place is good (and consistent). They also have grilled chicken and seafood too.

Been here at this location a few times and the service is fast, friendly, and efficient. I also like the tall booths for a bit more privacy. 

The double-layer chocolate cake slice was so BIG, I had to smash it into the (plastic polyurethane) to-go container....enough to share with several people."}
{"text":"Its nice to come to a chain restaurant that have most of the same people working their time and time again.  Roy is the best waiter I have had ever had at any restaurant.   We have not been here for almost 6 months and he still remembers what our favorite drinks are.   This restaurant is so quiet with their high back booths it makes for a nice relaxing place to enjoy a reasonably priced steak.

I can honestly say i cant think of a bad thing to say. 

Give it a try."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We been here for 1:20 mins still havent been served or even came by for refill in out drinks so ridiculous for the prices they have definately need better customer service!"}
{"text":"Another awesome steakhouse with great service and even better food. Their steaks are cooked exactly to order and perfectly each time I go. Their deserts are a little heavy especially after having a full steak dinner but I still highly recommend eating there. It's not too expensive for a steakhouse (maybe 1.5 $) which is highly appreciated since having a great steak dinner shouldn't burn through your pocket."}
{"text":"Having dined at locations in CA before moving here we have long time experience with their steak dinners and in Mesa it has become the go to restaurant when the family comes to visit. Everyone loves the Campfire dinner option they offer from time to time and the service is top notch. Love dining in the booths and enjoy the professional touch. Everything is cooked as ordered with no need to ever send anything back. Highly recommend for a relaxed dinner experience."}
{"text":"Tonight my dad flew out from Tennessee. He couldn't wait to go to Black Angus and have a steak and some beer, just like he remembered when he used to live here in Arizona. Unfortunately though our experience was less than Pleasant it took about 7 to 10 minutes to get noticed by a server. Took another 5 to get our drinks. Took 15 minutes for him to take our order.
 Before out appetizer arrived, our salads and then our food arrived. We got our appetizer after my husband finished his dinner. The manager came over and apologized for not getting our appetizer to us before our meal but that was the end of it. There was no let me take this off your bill, let me see what I can do to lessen the charge, let me see if I can make it up to you to earn your return business. 
We were so severely disappointed. My dad who lives in Tennessee will probably not come back to Arizona and go to Black Angus again. This was probably our last visit to Black Angus and we are so very saddened by this because in the past we've had great service and in the past we've had great food. Tonight wAS just not the case. I hope they fix this issue."}
{"text":"The waitresses got her regulars drinks before our refills even though we were there and asked for our drinks first, then the onion rings I asked to be well done were barely cooked, and not many visits to the table. We did however get a free desert for my wife's birthday with a pretty lackluster presentation, but whatever. The food is pretty good just don't ask for onion rings. Ribs are to die for, but service is a 3 star."}
{"text":"Love their wings, to die for, great margaritas and ribeye! Love Tuesdays as they're all day happy hour."}
{"text":"My fiance and I tried Black Angus for the first time tonight and loved it. The waitresses and manager were super nice and friendly. The high back booths are amazing. Being someone without children, I didn't hear a kid in the place. I ordered a filet and they didn't ask if I wanted it butterflied, which I feel is cheating, and it was cooked to perfection. It is a bit pricey, but we'll worth the environment and service."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here occasionally. We love the Campfire dinner, but we use the coupon we find online so we save a lot of money! We usually get 2 orders of the campfire dinner. This time I came, it took 40 minutes for dinner to come out. Thankfully we had appetizers and bread, but even the service was slow. It was a Tuesday night and there weren't many people there. This won't stop me from coming back though. I haven't been disappointed much so far."}
{"text":"I must say I can only eat at the one in Goodyear! The others I've visited don't compare. It's always consistent the food taste great and the service excellent.  Amber the server is hands down one of the best if not the best server in Goodyear. If you read my Yelps you'll see I'm quite picky and brutally honest, probably because I use to be in the restaurant business and I have eaten out every night for the last 10 years. The Fire Grill Chicken with melted jack and bacon strips with honey mustard (a dish they allowed me to create) that's real customer satisfaction. They get it!!! Oh and the FRESH brown bread!!! Yummmm!! From Management to staff, kudos!  Alice, Tom (asst. manager) and Amber job well done!!"}
{"text":"How does a $100 lunch on your day off turn into a horrible experience?  It happens when you dine at black angus Metrocenter, inattentive wait staff, who forgets your order....... THEN ARGUES THAT YOU NEVER PLACED SAID ORDER!!!!!! I hope corporate sees this. This location has been going downhill for the past decade. It's ALWAYS the LITTLE THINGS that tear businesses down! In my business we live by this \"it cost a million dollars to get the customer through the door, and it's absolutely FREE to make sure they never come back again!\""}
{"text":"I wasn't to happy that the waitress said its only one coupon per table and wasn't able to order more things even though the coupon said it can be good for up to. 6 people. I would recommend this location to my family or friends. I'll have to try another one."}
{"text":"Tasty steakhouse.  There's a coupon in the weekly junkmail bundle round here that makes this more affordable."}
{"text":"Menu and service were ok, ribeye was undercooked, TV reception at the bar is horrible for sports.  Beer selection is minimal."}
{"text":"Great place, and food, staff is great, especially Rich  is a great server and treats people as number one.Join club, get coupons on line.  Service and food is awesome."}
{"text":"On Mother's Day we made a reservation for 6:30 PM. Upon arriving we were informed that they were barely seating at 5:00 PM reservations and that our wait would be significantly longer. However, a manager came and spoke with us and made accommodations to get us seated promptly. He also gave us a coupon for future use. Kudos to management! \"Jason Periolat\""}
{"text":"Awesome !!!! I wanted Surf n. Turf & here is one Of the best places in town to get great steak and great service !!!! I love it I'll be back it's the best lots of birthday parties everyone loves it !!!"}
{"text":"My spouse and I ate dinner here on a weeknight with a coupon that basically cut the price of our meal in half.  We shared a combo appetizer platter and both had the prime rib.  It was a typical \"steakhouse\" experience, not great food but not bad either.  With the coupon our meal was definitely a good value, without it, probably not so much.  I didn't notice any cleanliness issues in the bathroom or dining area as other reviewers have remarked.  Service was perfunctory, but that's pretty much what you can expect at any chain store restaurant."}
{"text":"My sister is visiting from MD and from airport said she wanted lamb chops.  Ended up here...big mistake.
Started out being a good experience with our waiter, then served drink orders without straws.  When requested, they were open and wrapped in one paper towel and looked used.  One had what looked like fruit and the other was sticky all over.  The food took 20 minutes in a relatively empty restaurant.  Wouldn't have minded of the waiter had updated us atleast once.  When received the plate was very hot but the food was luke warm and disappointing.  Immediately sent back...which lasted another 30 minutes with the same result.

My sister ordered the lamb which looked great on menu but like bones on her plate..SMH..NEVER AGAIN
..unless for cocktails which were great..."}
{"text":"Service was fine except they got part of my order wrong. My bacon cheeseburger was missing the bacon. I did not like sitting next to the kitchen due to all of the noise coming from the food preparations."}
{"text":"The steaks were excellent!! The establishment was just opening (Opens at 3pm - we arrived about 3:39), so it wasn't very busy, still our server was M.I.A. a lot. The overhead music was unusually loud but no biggie - we just talked louder & had a great time. Viva la great company and good meals."}
{"text":"Great food at a decent price. My favorite appetizer are the potato skins. The fish and chips are great, too. Rating a 3 because I placed a phone order and the employee advised that the order would be ready for pick-up in 5-10 minutes but I ended up waiting like 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Friendly server. The comp bread tasted like paper. The cheesy potatoes tasted like a frozen food meal. I ordered fish and chips and they didn't let me substitute for tater tots which I thought was weird. Mac and cheese was ok but the fried fish was good."}
{"text":"Good food, large menu to suit everyone's needs. They're accommodating here. An example is my girl does not eat bacon so they will bring out bacon free potato skins. The food is fresh and desserts are great!"}
{"text":"The family decided to bring me here for my Father's Day dinner.  We had reservations and were seated immediately upon arrival . . . the waitress took our drink orders and returned with the drinks and took our order.

The Montana Mule was good . . . but could have used a little less ginger beer and a little more bourbon.

The filet was cook perfectly . . . the rice and potatoes were hot and tasty . . . the onion strings were hot and crispy . . . and the mud pie was just the perfect finish.
 
The reason for only four stars . . . two of the five steaks were not cook right . . . but were still good.

Definitely a return trip restaurant . . ."}
{"text":"A little bit pricier than let's say Texas Roadhouse or Longhorn Steakhouse, but the food is here is great.  One thing you should do is subscribe to their email list since they frequently give the campfire special for 2 for $45 instead of the normal price of $60.  While the food was great, the only thing that was not fantastic was the bread.  Texas Roadhouse and Longhorn give fantastic fresh bread.  For some reason the bread tasted old, perhaps they were sitting a while before we got them.  The server, while attentive, brought our food after we waited about 35 minutes.  This happened even when it was a random day during the week and the restaurant was not even that packed, so I can imagine on a busy day.  Still, loved my steak and sides so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went to Black Angus on Friday night and it was busy. They quoted us a 35 minute wait and I thought that was optimistic based on the number of people waiting. I was right because it ended up being 50 minutes. Crazy! And shortly before we were called, a giant party of like 20-25 people got called back. It looked like a busload of people flooding in. So weird. After we were seated, we decided on the Campfire Feast since we had a coupon for $42.
We ordered potato skins for the appetizer and they brought out the tasty bread. For my meal I selected the Fire Grilled Chicken with a side of teriyaki sauce, garlic mashed potatoes, and grilled asparagus. The potato skins were yummy and we ended up taking half of them home. When our server brought our food out, she told us she just learned that they were out of the bacon mac & cheese my boyfriend ordered. She said it would be 8 minutes and he said he would wait. Shortly after, the manager came over and said they wouldn't have any more mac & cheese tonight and offered another side. He settled for onion rings.
My chicken was fine, the mashed taters were ok, a little dry, and the asparagus were alright. The green beans my boyfriend had were delicious! They have bacon and whatever seasoning they use is awesome. The onion rings were also great. Super fresh and hot. Mmmm! We were quite full but we still had dessert to eat. We decided on the New York Style Cheesecake. It was great! It seemed to have a lemon flavor and had the strawberry daiquiri sauce on top. So some good things, some not so good. Still not ever worth a 50 minute wait. I guess we will make a reservation next time."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Black Angus in general. The food is usually sub par, over priced, and service poor....

That being said I will say that the Black Angus on McDowell Rd in Goodyear has never served me bad food and only 1 in the many times I have ate there did I get bad service and that really wasn't the waitresses fault but rather the family in the booth next to us was letting there 3 year old run around the restaurant with a stake knife even going so far as to run into the kitchen, and climb into our booth and hit my husband at which point we asked to be moved. I think in that case a manager should have asked the family to control the young one for safety reasons

....that long story aside I always get the 1 lb prime rib (I don't like gristle and fat so 1 lb ends up being 8 oz after I slice and dice it) and it is always perfect!!!! Also watch for the coupons (I know I know) that are buy one entree get a second for $8.99 which is almost a $16 dollar discount, you get a GREAT meal for less than $30 for 2 adults."}
{"text":"Had the $59+ for 2 people which included appetizer, entree & dessert. I ordered the filet minon, mash potatoes & mac&cheese. My other ordered prime rib rice & baked potato. This appetizer was great we had the sampler, it was good, reasonable size. The whole experience was top notch, our server was kind, gracious, & quick! The entree took awhile to arrive but it was delicious once it arrived!! Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. Food was excellent, service was friendly, and patio was quiet. Great for a for a corporate chain!"}
{"text":"The servers and staff are all very friendly over here.
I do enjoy this location, food here is always consistent."}
{"text":"Had a small birthday party celebration.  Our waitress Rebecca was absolutely great and added to a wonderful experience.  Food was top notch."}
{"text":"Went to Black Angus service was terribly slow got cold baked potato sent it back got another cold one waitress never asked took forever to get change had to go get it myself terrible do not recommend"}
{"text":"Food as average at best, the reason for the rating of 1 star is because I could not give it a lower rating as the  service was excessively slow. We will not dine their again!

I received a call a few days ago from the general manager who was asking about our experience. He said that he was going to make things right.... To date that has not been done. Not going to hold my breathe


So the GM was good to his word we did in fact receive a full refund"}
{"text":"This Black Angus location has exceptional service, a very friendly staff, and great food! I've eaten here many times over the last 2 years and the level of consistency at this location is hard to match. This is no small coincidence-the staff at this location will happily think outside the box to make sure you have a great experience."}
{"text":"Although my special guy and I kinda forgot about our anniversary it was a afterthought but great choice. Good service, food was also fantastic. Certainly a place we'll come back to."}
{"text":"Love their drinks, they make the best dirty martini in town!  All the steaks are great, as is the prime rib.  And they are a great value if you sign up for the reward club and use the email specials. Quiet elegant atmosphere and good service too!!"}
{"text":"Really good service and steak as expected.  Nice atmosphere for Monday Night Football....oh yea baby!"}
{"text":"There are those times when you eat out and just know the entire service will be disastrous. You know when you get seated and get your drinks ordered and that takes longer than five minutes and then when the drinks come... the server is like ooppps we need to get you some bread.... then ten minutes later that comes and you place your appetizer order and that takes fifteen minutes. Now you know your main course will never come. 

Well this happened to us today. What's funny is that we both order salads thinking it would ups take less time. Nope! It wasn't until forty minutes later did we receive our meal. The server who was also the bartender never said she was sorry for the delay, even when I said in a disgusted tone can we just get boxes and the check when she placed the salads on the table.

The hostess saw out dismay and offered an apology and an excuse that the restaurant was busy and that's why the service took so long. Really the place was like 25% filled, so what happens when it's packed and there is a line of people waiting? I would hate to get that service!! Probably would have to wait until hell froze over to get any service. I would have thought they would have at least notified a manager and let them know that our service was egregiously delayed! Well no more return visits for us!"}
{"text":"Yuck! Made the mistake of going here on my birthday. The service was very very bad. Had to ask for silverware and had to wait a long time to get our food. The inside was worn and outdated as well. The food was not worth the price. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday evening and it was just the right amount of diners. Ordered the Bleu cheese & portobello mushroom topped filet with loaded baked potato. I ordered the steak well done but seated on the outside. I had to send it back but it was much better when it came back to the table. The hostess and waitress were friendly & very helpful!"}
{"text":"We have been dining here every Dec 24th for 9 straight years now and we have had exceptional food and service every year! They offer such great food specials that can't be beat. Their food is on par with other top steak restaurants but we have always been the most impressed by the outstanding service we receive. The waitresses we have had have all been very friendly, enjoyable and prompt to the table we each course and/or beverage. We always look forward to this holiday meal tradition to start off our Christmas Holidays."}
{"text":"First time at this location..waitress had zero personality only came back maybe 2x and never offered water refills until we were completely done with our meal. Most of my food was lukewarm/cold. Broccoli was too hard to cut with a fork. Food was lacking flavor also WAY overpriced!!"}
{"text":"Im only writing this review because the food was really not worth the price. Even with a coupon for the campfire feast being 42$, I would have much rather spent the money elsewhere. There was absolutely nothing good about the meal besides the waitress and manager were nice. The food quality was on the same level as applebees. Really bums me out that I went there to take my Grandpa out for his 75 bday. My advise to anyone reading this is to go to captain Bill's down the road..."}
{"text":"Super expensive given the quality of food. Kids steak was $8 and was the thinnest and cheapest piece of steak. It was charred. The rice, chicken and fries had no flavor. I would come back if the meal was cheaper but you're better off going to Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"I come here mostly for lunch, and it's a great experience every time. I don't know what it is about their chicken caesar salad, but I'm a huge fan. The service is always good, although if you're in a hurry, you should let them know or they'll more or less leave you alone to enjoy your food. The booths are tall and private, making you feel separated from the rest of the world while you enjoy your food and talk.  I've never been disappointed, which is why I'll keep going back."}
{"text":"Poor service from beginning to end.  Prime rib was ok, but thats about it.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here. Not a good experience so far. Sitting in bar area, had to wait like 10 mins before we got water, only one person working, seems to be struggling, very little help from manager who seemed to be watching the game. Guessing customer asked a question about another game being on, bartender was trying to find possible game on TV, manager came from around the corner and very loudly stated \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING DAVID, DON'T TOUCH THE TV. \" I'm a little irritated because I'm use to seeing managers helping out, but not here, the manager seems to only know how to occasionally pick up dishes from the tables. He's not checking on the customers here making sure everything is going smoothly with the service, obviously the bartender again is struggling, maybe I'm wrong for having sympathy for the bartender. Afraid to go back. Forgot to add restaurant was not that busy."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I have had dining at ANY Black Angus....not because I am not a fan but more so because there are fewer and fewer of them in my local area.  This week there happened to be some coupons in our mail so Rosealyn, who really likes BA suggested it as a spot for this weeks dinner.

We stopped by on a Wednesday evening, there were four of us for dinner and we went fairly early.  Sadly this is the Geriatric hour so the median age was at least 65 as they blue hairs need to feed and be tucked into bed well before 7 or they turn into pumpkins or something worse.

Our waiter was Chris.  Young, energetic but a bit disconnected and mechanical in his mannerisms, for what ever reason I will never know.  He took our order for both food and drinks and was advised of our desire to use the coupons which BA was offering.  

Rosealyn and Phil ordered the $39.95 Camp Fire Feast for Two. They chose the Wagon Wheel Sampler Platter as their Appetizer to share which had Crispy Fried Garlic-Pepper Zucchini, Buffalo Chicken Tenders, 2 Loaded Potato Skins and Shrimp Cocktail.  I think that should have been a meal in and of itself but there is more to come.  Then the main dish was Prime rib and they shared a Big Mountain Fudge Cake for Dessert which taken home as they were completely full after all food listed above.  

Margaret eats like a bird so she had the Loaded Baked Potato Soup then a plate of the Deep Fried Garlic-Pepper Zucchini with Cucumber dipping sauce which was too much for her to finish.  I opted for the $15.99 1/2 lb. Prime & Mud dinner.  This was Prime Rim with Sweet Potato Fries and a Caesar Salad followed by a huge chuck of Sky High Mud Pie.  My Prime was small, looking more like something on a steak sandwich but served rare and flavorful as it should be.  Horse Radish sauce and Au Jus were also offered in the side.  The fries were crispy and the salad quite large. Since there was so much food I also asked for my dessert to-go and then ended up leaving it on the table as we departed...a major disappointment on my part.

Overall it was a good food experience.  The food was flavorful and at the right temperatures and I would certainly go back.  The waiter could have been a bit more friendly and less preoccupied but you cannot have everything.  If you are going to take advantage of the Happy Hour pricing, REMEMBER its ONLY available in the bar and NOT in the main restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible service. 

We ordered apps, salad, meal and dessert. Not ONE plate was ever removed after finishing the courses. We had to just keep stacking them off to the side to make room for the next portion of our meal. 

Drinks were not filled promptly. It wasn't until we were sucking on ice cubes before the waitress even asked if we wanted more. 

They asked us if we wanted dessert before we were even halfway done with our entree. Clearly there were rushing us out of there even though the place was mostly empty.

Check was incorrect. Our coupon was not removed. And the waitress stood over me while I was totally out the tab (apparently to see what her tip would be).

Food was average. Nothing that would override the horrible service.

The best part? As we were leaving the hostess asked \"Was everything ok?\" and I said, \"Actually no, the service was awful\" to which she replied \"Well, I hope you have a good night anyway!\"

Really? There are three steakhouses all in a row at Metrocenter. You'd think you'd want to stand apart from the crowd. We'll do Longhorn next time."}
{"text":"My first time going to Black Angus and will be the last time.   Didn't last five minutes we walked out due to the waitress being rude and unprofessional. I ask her what drinks u have here?  She was impatient and stated \" let me get you water and bread until u decided what drink u want. No suggestion, recommendation??  (I never in my life)   Notified the Manager, and she wanted to get her side of the story.  We went down the street and spend our hard earn money at Red Lobster and had excellent service.   Its sad I heard they food is excellent, from my staff at the Hospital. But I will not be treated rudely by some waitress..."}
{"text":"My wife & I celebrated our anniversary here the other day. We came in with a two-meal coupon that got us two entrees, an appetizer and a dessert for $41.  Quite the deal considering we got enough food to each take home enough for lunch the next day and dessert for a couple days.

We picked out the Wagon Wheel sampler that has Crispy Fried Garlic-Pepper Zucchini (loved it), Chipotle-Buffalo Chicken Tenders (saved for next day), Loaded Potato Skins and Shrimp Cocktail. Everything was good but nothing was exceptional.  We wished the shrimp cocktail came with 4 shrimp instead of 3 (I got black eye going for the third shrimp). 

My wife got the New York strip steak, baked potato soup and a salad.  She got her steak medium well, just like she wanted.  I blinked and her soup was gone.  She loved it!

I got the filet (which was a $3 upgrade), a loaded baked potato (no sour cream) and the potatoes au gratin.  I was very pleased with my medium filet and my baked potato.  The potatoes au gratin went home and were delicious the next day too.

For dessert we got the chocolate fudge cake that could have fed 4 or 5 people.  It had a little ice cream on it that we shared and then we took at least half of it home.

Bottomline - the food was good.  The price was good.  I have nothing to complain about and look forward to going back next time I get a coupon in the mail."}
{"text":"It was very tasty and excellent service.  I am a fan!  It was my first time at a Black Angus Steakhouse and I'm excited to go again.  The food was very typical of steakhouse fare, but executed very well."}
{"text":"I don't normally give such a low rating; however, this Black Angus really let us down. From failing to bring limes with my water, to the over-cooked bread, to never bringing my second side, and our server never stopped by to fill up our waters. We had to ask a different server for water refills and to-go containers. The food I did receive was delicious (except for the chewy bread), but if you want to be completely ignored by your server, this seems to be the place to go. The other servers who helped us were awesome! I wish they could have received the tip, instead of the guy who failed to hear what we asked for and then completely ignored that we existed! I changed my rating from 1 star to two, simply because the other servers were great."}
{"text":"Love this place and location ! It is my birthday ! Ashley is the bomb ! Alway like the vibe here"}
{"text":"Placed a Togo order with them and they quoted me 15min cool. I arrived 20min later. I still had to wait 25min after that to get my food. How is 15min turned into 40min?!? No apology no discount and no care. The managers are clueless and some of the worst in the business, I would recommend going next door to the other two steakhouses before ordering from here. Save your time and your money."}
{"text":"Never been here before and my first time experience here was great. Visiting from Seattle!!! The staff was excellent and on top of it. The waitresses were hilarious and endearing. For the price and the quality of food it's such a great deal. I recommend anyone never have been to go now. Thanks too our waiter, David for he was great at his job and well professional."}
{"text":"It was worth the drive here from Mesa (where there is a Black Angus, but that one is not so great) for Thanksgiving Dinner.  In this busy shopping area, Black Angus was I think the ONLY restaurant that was open on Thanksgiving Day.  Parking lot was packed, people waiting outside, but we had a reservation, so only waited about 10 mins, not bad.
Our server was terrific (Molly), and our table was in a quiet area.  The turkey dinner with all the trimmings was terrific - just the right size portion.  We didn't have room for the pumpkin pie included with each dinner, so we took those home.  An excellent value, and I was impressed with the organization of the host/check-in desk."}
{"text":"This Black Angus is right across the I-17 from Outback. Black Angus is a bit more expensive than the other, but the bar area makes it worth it. Five big screens while you're eating, all at eye-level. 

It's about $15-25/per person. My NY Strip Steak was $22 with 2 sides, Pepsi was $2.50. You can find a sports bar anywhere in Phoenix, but can you get a steak there?"}
{"text":"Ordered a $26 Filet Minion & it was over cooked. No flavor or taste to it. 2nd time I've gotten a bad steak at this location. Mesa location has always been better."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great meal at Black Angus over the weekend. We went early so there was a short wait time to be seated. We sat in a booth with high backs which provide a nice intimate setting. We order the campfire meal for two. Enjoyed sharing a starter of 6 shrimp cocktail. Nice size shrimp and tasty cocktail sauce. Husband enjoyed a huge Caesar salad and We both ended up ordering a sirloin which were cooked to perfection.   I had a loaded baked potato and he had agratin potatoes. Mine was better than his he thought his potatoes were a bit dry. We finished up with a flourless chocolate torte. Very rich and chocolaty. We had a coupon so the meal came to $50 with tax not bad for 3 course meal."}
{"text":"I admit that I came here with a coupon.  Without, it would be way out of my price range.

The food was great and I have no complaints.  When my wife salted her food and the cap came off the shaker the management replaced the entire plate and threw in a free bowl of soup while she waited for the replacement.

For going for my Birthday I got a giant fresh cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top."}
{"text":"Can't believe I didn't review Black Angus yet. I'd passed Black Angus almost every day on my way to pick up my fianc√© from work and asked a couple people if they'd ever tried and liked it and everyone had good things to say. Then I went on a \"birthday freebie\" sign up spree and ended up signing up for Black Angus' prime club and they sent me some amazing coupons. I received a coupon for a lobster/steak/shrimp trio that I'm still kind of bummed I didn't use but the coupon I did use offered even more bang for my buck. They offer this campfire feast which comes with a molasses bread, a steakhouse starter, two entr√©es, four sides (two per entr√©e), and a dessert. It's normally $58 but my coupon made it $42. We started with the jumbo shrimp cocktail and those shrimp were definitely jumbo. Wasn't a fan of the molasses bread and I can honestly say that's the first time I've ever been offered complimentary bread and it was left virtually untouched. For our entr√©es, I ordered the 6oz filet mignon for an extra $3 and my fianc√© also paid the extra $3 for the 12oz rib eye. My filet was so good like melt in your mouth good but her rib eye was EVERYTHING. It was so flavorful and tender, I already know that's what I'm ordering next time. We ordered mac and cheese, green beans with bacon, mashed potatoes, and fries for our sides and I ate 3 out of 4 of those sides and also sampled the fries - everything tasted great. The mac and cheese was baked and had a nice crispy layer of cheese on top which I love, it's my favorite part of baked mac and cheese. My green beans were also good, they had a lot of favor due to the bacon and just the right amount of crunch and the fries and mashed potatoes were solid. We were stuffed so I ordered my carrot cake to go. It was a standard carrot cake but it was huge and it took me three days to pretty much finish it. I probably wouldn't order the carrot cake again but it was good. Our waitress was nice and the ambience of the restaurant was really nice for a much-needed date night. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and plan on visiting again very soon."}
{"text":"Each year we make a reservation for Thanksgiving at this particular BA as its close to home.  This will be the last year!  The food is OK.  We were sat near the employee register and did we get an ear full from the staff.  A constant ear full of 'I'm tired' and 'my arms hurt' and 'are we still in a wait' and 'why do we have to work on a holiday' and much much more.  It was as if they had a right to openly complain about having to work because it was a holiday and how dare we eat out. As someone who had to be at work at midnight, it was pitiful.  It was a race to get us in and out of that place as fast as possible. So much so that we were given our bill before we actually received our included desert that we were encourage to take to go.  And then the constant 'Is this ready for me' in reference to the bill during our eating of desert put me over the edge.   It has slowly gone down hill year after year but this year was the one that broke the tradition."}
{"text":"Once again my order was screwed up. For the 2nd time the manager has to make a bigger deal out of than needed to be made. I won't be hot my back."}
{"text":"We had the special 2 for $45 steak dinner.  Ribeye and filet are charged extra $3 (on the menu, no surprise), which is rather expensive for steaks that don't compare to Flemmings or Stockyard.  The appetizers were great, the side dishes were great.  The steak was cooked as ordered.  The service was awful.  Our server did not serve the wine, so when we asked for it as we were eating the appetizer, she said, \"Oh, I thought you would like it with your meal.\"  I think she should have asked and taken responsibility for her error.  She never apologized.  She also did not serve us promptly.  Checked on us once.  We did not get our bill for about 20 minutes after we finished.   It was wrong, so we asked her to fix it, and it took her five to ten minutes to bring it back.  She never came to pick it up, so after about another fifteen minutes, we paid with cash and left it on the table."}
{"text":"We went for my mothers birthday and it seemed like our waitress didn't care about our table but the table across from us she gave a lot of attention to. We felt and ignored and we won't be coming here again. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Lunch service only. 

I swear my fellow diners at hospital canteens look in better shape than the  mass that \"meats\"  for late lunch at this location. This wasn't just a grey tide but a few human buoys had popped in too.   Please withhold the \" don't be so judgmental\"  holier than though attitude , this is a review site  after all.   

Lately I have been working remotely ( or remotely working)  on the Friday so I've been going out on Fridays for lunch since it's all \"new\" to me.  The same places that I eat out at  in the evening often have vastly different characters during the day and  this Black Angus throws it into sharp relief.  For example at night I have never been served stale bread. 

At night they have  a wide range of ages , group sizes and noise levels  and  there's some life in the place. Chilis that just opened up nearby and seems to have kidnapped the life leaving   a quiet, genteel even , location that would be more fitting in the deep south when you don't have anything better to do. So far this is the only local place that  exceeded my hour. 

Food's ok ,  fitting with the  price range and  the burgers are well appointed,   cooked to request and  relatively  tasteful.  Fries tepid and it feels like the minimum  you have to do to keep the blue rinse and  Caddy driving class happy is all they are about when the sun is up.  The only thing hip about this place is the replacement joints.  

Coffee seems to have been held on life support  and brought out when some unsuspecting fool that refuses to believe in coffee only being  a morning drug. Usually the surroundings  don't bug me but it felt like the Hometown Buffet  , which I can live with until you give me stale bread  past it's sell by date which  I fear may a fitting epitaph for this place within daylight hours"}
{"text":"I have been here over 15 times.  I am a huge fan of their side dishes! Weird huh?  Why the steak?  I'll tell you why later.   My friends and I will literally go to place just for the side dishes and sometimes that's all we will order.

We Love:

Wedge Salad:  The salad here is so fresh and every bite is full of flavor.  Sometimes blue cheese, in general, has too much flavor, but this cheese is just right.  It is my favorite salad that I have ever had and all my  friends get shocked when they get hooked on it.

Loaded Baked Potato Soup:  This has alot of flavor and it is basically what the title says.. a loaded baked potato that has bacon bits, cheese, and onion in a soup.   We enjoy every spoon of this.  It sounds like I am over exaggerating, but I really do love this soup.  If you read my other reviews, you will know that I do really love these items.

The Complimentary Bread:  It is a brownish bread that has a slight sweetness to it.   It comes warms and is very delicious with butter.  I usually order a second one to go.

Warm Cookie Dessert:  I don't know the exact name, but it was very sweet, hot, and good.  I like that it comes in a hot pan and the ice cream is about to melt.  Very good dessert, but it's so sweet I recommend sharing it with others.

Mud Pie Slice Dessert:  I love this dessert.  Every bite is very rich, but it's very good.

As for other items, I've had pretty much every side as my friends and always eat off eachother's plates, and I am not a fan of them.  The steaks are alright.  They are not as good as Texas Roadhouse or Monti's, but they are okay.  I still enjoy certain steaks, such as the ribeye and prime rib in medium rare.  Most of the time they cook it correctly, but not all.  

Seating here is very comfy.  There are a ton of roomy booths and some tables that you can sit in for those who don't like booths.  

If you sign up on their e-mail list, you can get alot of great deals with coupons and even get some buy one get one free meals or a dessert for your birthday!"}
{"text":"Nice steak place to try out but nowhere near tops.
The service is great and the place looks neat. The food is OK starting with the fried zucchini from the appetizer menu. The warm molasses bread and butter is outstanding. Not much of a selection on the draft beer but they have bullseye brew which I like. As for the steaks, many cuts and side selections to add but I like my steak plain. No A1 or any other cover up sauce for that matter. At Black Angus, the fist thing they ask after you get your food is if you would like A1. You know what that means. 
On my recent visit, I left a little disappointed. My steak was cooked way passed medium rare and too tough for a good cut of beef."}
{"text":"Super good ribeye steak, ceasar salad was also one of the best we have had. The warm bread that is offered complimentary with butter is my wifes favorite. This is one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"Great steak, cesear salad, warm bread, super shrimp coctail appetizer. Cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant to celebrate my daughters birthday.  Made reservation for 8 pm.  Arrived on time and had to wait for a table.  Others came in and were seated before us.  Just seemed odd to make reservations and have to wait anyway.  
Service was good but it appeared the place was understaffed.  Had to wait for drink refills, complimentary bread, appetizers (artichoke was awful but they comp'd us on this). 
Food: just ok.  Nothing amazing.  A little overpriced as well.  
From the time we were seated and our order was taken it took 40 min to get our orders.   
Overall this place was ok but be prepared to spend a lot.  For the price I'll go to flemings."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner on Sat.  Once I threw back the door, it took a while for my eyes to adjust to the low level lighting.  I felt like I was entering an underground lair, that hadn't seen natural light since the roof sealed its fate many years ago....Despite the dim lights, all that really mattered was getting out of the heat.

We were seated in the bar area where they had a few flat screens and a sound system playing 80s & 90s music softly in the background.  The place was pretty dead for a wknd, which meant that we received great service.   The bartender monitored our drink levels, inquiring about additional rounds when our glasses were near empty.  She even brought over replacement glasses from the cooler a few times for my mlite.

As for the food, it was ok.  I had a crab cake that had a little too much mayo for my taste and baked potato soup which was pretty good.  I'd go there again but BA didn't make my top 10.  I appreciate great service, value, and ambiance and this place scored low on the ambiance factor."}
{"text":"We went to dinner after work. The manager told us we could sit down on the left and he would bring us menu's.  We sat, and he didn't bring us any menus, so after sitting there a few minutes,I set the stopwatch on my phone.  Fifteen minutes later we still had no menus and had not been acknowledged by anyone. We got up and left.  Upon leaving nobody said a word. THEY WERE DEAD. Went to Chili's and had a wonderful dinner and great service."}
{"text":"this place is our usual go-to steak joint when we just casually want steak. nothing too fancy and reasonably prices. I like their camp side feast where you get to share an appetizer, get two steak dinners, and can share a dessert. I like to get the sampler appetizer because you get the most bang for your buck and comes with like 4 different things. I got the filet mignon medium rare with bleu cheese and saut√©ed mushrooms. for dessert I got the cowboy cookie with vanilla ice cream. the service is always good. food is pretty good. can't complain."}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse with wonderful service! Quiet atmosphere, cooked to perfection for all steaks ordered. Side portions just right and dessert could feed 4. Worth the visit if you're looking for a great steak!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for an early Valentine's dinner. Our first time at this location, very well kept, clean and staff very friendly. I can't remember our waitress name but she was very sweet and kept up with our drinks and constantly checked on us. Our food order was correct and fresh. Overall a great experience and we would come back."}
{"text":"It used to be that this was THE steakhouse to go to for date night.  Get the coupon for the appetizers, steaks and dessert and you were good.  Add some cocktails and it was a good date without breaking the bank.  It was no Ruth Chris but better than Sizzler by a long shot.  Then the whole area sprung up with steakhouses, Black Angus changed owners and now they are barely better than Sizzler.  The staff is still top notch but the food is not so hood.  My steak was tough, the shrimp salty and my lobster tail tasteless.  The wedge salad was good and the loaded baked potatoes are always good.  Not many folks there which made us think of when there uses to be a wait to get seated in Saturday night.  I think the coupons are the only thing keeping them going right now"}
{"text":"This is a Christmas Eve tradition for us that has been happening for 13 years! We are never disappointed, with either the food or the service!. The people here are kind, gracious and very engaging. They bring laughter and smiles to the table and are genuinely involved with you as people, not just as people want food.The steaks are as tender as they can get and amazingly, if they are not cooked to utter perfection (they have you cut into your steak to check) they will then and there remove it and bring back another one. Now that is good service. We will continue to make this place our holiday tradition.
Thank you Black Angus for having such a special place and people."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately. The tables are spacious and private, nice atmosphere. We both had the Salmon, mine was with the wild rice and fresh green beens. Salmon was delicious, perfectly prepared. The green beans were crisp and delicious and topped with a generous amount of bacon. The wild rice went perfectly with the salmon. Paired my entree with a glass of Kendall Jackson Chardonnay. Had to wait a bit for the check- luckily I'm not in a rush tonight .Perfect ending to a long, hot day in Arizona"}
{"text":"My food was delicious! I had the Filet Mignon, prawns, steamed broccoli and a baked potato. I wish I took a picture of my meal, but it looked to good to wait to eat it! If you're dining on a Friday night request Jessica, Amber or Brianna as your server. The manager Alice herself came by our table and greeted us as well. They were all extremely polite, helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Not a good Christmas Eve we been going for years as a family but this year was not good.  Once we were at the table we could not find the server other tables after us getting seated were being served. I had to go back to the front to ask for help. We sat there for 15 min before a manager stop by  I think her name was Alice she was awesome trying to say the day. But once the server came back it went down hill again. The food came out cold and way over cooked she did not even come back to ask if everything was ok.  We were excited to go as my girl love it there. It sure did not make it a special night before Christmas"}
{"text":"I still recognize that this is a chain steak house.  But when compared to others (Outback comes to mind) it amazes me that there aren't more of them (BAS)  or more to the point that the chain has not done well over the years.

First, I've figured out where a lot of these culinary school grads go when they can't get a job elsewhere.

As a result of actual culinary school trained chefs/cooks showing up at places like BSA the quality of food is quite good.

Had the fried zucchini with their cucumber ranch (or whatever they call it).  Very good.  The zucchini is lightly breaded and fried.  Is not greasy at all and the cucumber ranch is reallllyyyy good.

Next up, wedge salad.  As always, one salad is enough for two to share, so don't waste one of your two sides getting another salad if you go the wedge route.

Ordered the grilled corn and asparagus.  Both fresh and very good.  Some complaint/observation as before on the asparagus.  The cooks don't always do the best job of trimming off the ends.  I'm not going to get into how to do it properly, but if you want to know how it should be done, you can google it.

Finally, on to the dead animal.  I had the new york strip  I thought it was pretty good.  The wife had the prime rib .  Good again.

Value wise their dead on...especially if you have a coupon.  Quality wise their pretty doggone good and that's comparing it to just about anyone and they're certainly better than their peer competitors."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this Black Angus about half a dozen times in the past year. The service is always excellent but the food has been hit or miss. It was a Friday night and he was craving a burger, but not the normal fast food burger, I wasn't. So we decided on Black Angus, close to the house and they have a kids menu.  

It was about 6 and the restaurant was not busy, no wait..on a Friday..made us think here we go again..The hostess sat us quickly and the server said he would be right back, waited about 5 minutes and he came back to take our drink order. When he brings our drinks we order our entrees' the Steakhouse Burger, fries & garden salad for the hubs, 6 oz filet, loaded baked & garden salad for me, the child decided he wanted mac & cheese. Salads arrived quickly with the complimentary loaf of bread.  Salads were nothing to write home about but the bread was hot and fresh baked. Entrees' arrived shortly after. Husbands burger looked awesome and he said it tasted great. The fries were the average frozen type. My steak was cooked to perfection, hot and pink on the inside with the right amount of seasoning. The potato was picture perfect but could have used a tad more butter, the meal as a whole will get no complaints from me. The child's mac & cheese was classic Kraft's, he ate it eagerly waiting to get that sundae that comes with each kid's meal. 

The service was outstanding, we never had dirty dishes nor did our  beverages run dry. Our waiter was polite and made conversation. The food was above average. 

If Black Angus could nail it every time like they did on the last visit it would be a favorite on our list."}
{"text":"When dad comes to town, we come here. We love the food and coupons! we also love sitting in the same section and seeing the same staff.  They always remember my dad is an out of towner.  The best part is they ignore his off color political comments.  He is getting up there in age (late 70s) and needs his routines.  They get this and make things easy.   Thank you :)."}
{"text":"We love to go to this location for our family dinners. Last night was no exception... In Fact, last night was our best experience ever!! The food was great but our service was absolutely amazing last night!!!

Hannah D., was our server and she absolutely rocked our meal... Our water glasses were never empty, our cocktails were always fresh and our food was timed perfectly... 

Ask for Hannah when you go to this location... She is amazing!! Very impressed!!

Peace and Love!!

{"text":"Looking back on my past dining experiences, I wouldn't pay the extra dollars to eat at Ruth's Chris, Morton's etc simply because their quality of meat doesn't appear to be significantly better than Black Angus'.  I have never left this specific location feeling unfulfilled.  Of course I have left thinking I may need a gurney to get to the car, but that's merely a sign that I enjoyed my meal.  

I've had the New York Strip and Filet and both have been incredibly well prepared.  The garlic mashed potatoes are almost as good as those from the Keg Steakhouse.  The Au Gratin Potatoes are topped with some heavenly baked cheese and are a great alternative to the garlic mashed.  The shrimp cocktail is very tasty and the bread is damn good, so don't be afraid to request more and more of it!  The Big Mountain Chocolate Fudge Cake is a chocolate lover's dream, although the pure shot to your taste buds is a little overwhelming.  

My wife and I will continue to make the BA in Chandler a quality stop that we can come back to every couple of months.  The quality of food, location and service is excellent and make it a worthwhile alternative to other steak shops.

*TIp 1* 
Take a look at your local mailers or Sunday coupon sections.  BA provides plenty of coupons, like the $40 1 app, 2 main courses, 4 sides and 1 dessert coupon.  

**Tip 2**
Happy hour is M-F 3-7PM.  Do a pre-partying before hitting Chandler Mall or the store in the area.

***Tip 3***
They open at 11AM on Sat and 12PM on Sun and their bar area is open and full of flat panel TVs.  Enjoy a great meal while watching college football or NFL games."}
{"text":"We had party of 7 for dinner.  I ordered sirloin and grilled prawns.  Baked potato and a caesar salad with blue cheese dressing.  Omg my food was so good.  Everyone had excellent meals.  Excellent server. Manager very kind.  Long drive but worth it.  My family enjoyed our dinner so much."}
{"text":"Showed up at the end of the night 8:30pm. Ordered shrimp cocktail & a filet. The order was nearly $50. So I had a drink in the bar while I waited (I was the only customer in the restaurant, and now I know why). The bartender really only cared about texting her BF that didn't seemed to really want her to go somewhere with him, as she was announcing it to another server. I kindly asked to turn the sound up on 1 of the several TV's to watch the Laker game and was denied saying I can go to one of the corner TVs and they'll turn up the sound on the corner??? Really? Food was average at best. I'll probably head over to steakhouse next door next time. Staff and management could use some personality adjustments if they are going to be in customer service."}
{"text":"This was the best experience I've ever had in any restaurant.  Our server, Lisa was awesome.  They were super busy on Saturday night but service was excellent and the food was wonderful!  Always a favorite when in town."}
