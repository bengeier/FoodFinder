{"text":"I been to Westgate many times because I live near that location. Is one of the places to hangout with friends and spend time their. Also it a out door place so you can see the nature and the weather, and parking is easy to find in most times."}
{"text":"Horrible event traffic. Why have fireworks down here for 15 minutes if you're going to sit in traffic for hours?! Not worth it"}
{"text":"Took layla here on a Thursday night to play in the splash pad with a friend. Had a great time. We were here from 5pm to 630 ish and it wasn't crowded at all. We brought snacks for the kids to eat. Didn't have time to get a drink afterwards at one of tue restaurants but that is our usual routine after going to the splash pad at here."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately it appears as though the high end stores have decided to fore go their zip code on this one.  On the plus side, it does have a two huge arenas in its corner, so at least you have something to do while waiting for your event to start.  I would have liked to have seen more Kierland type stores in here.  It's a bummer since this place had so much potential."}
{"text":"Hmmm Wesgate. Though i have had a lovely time here because of the company i was keeping. The truth is this little strip mall is ehh. Its pretty much  another suburb/commercial structure that seems to be taking over the Arizona land. If your in the mood for that or want to go to an amc you can hit this place, but its not somewhere to go out of your way too."}
{"text":"I don't see why everyone is giving Westgate such a low rating.  Yea, it's a little pricy.  What are you expecting? We aren't eating at the neighborhood McDonalds. Yea, it's on the Westside of town.  If the drive bothers you, move closer. Maybe that would improve your rating a little.  Westgate has a lot to offer no matter what side of town it's on.  I like the variety of places to choose from. Whether you're looking for a place to eat, looking to get your drink on, or in the mood for some shopping; Westgate has it all.  I usually gravitate twards Westgate on Fridays and Saturdays for the nightlife, (see my night hawk badge? haha) where you will find a bunch of twenty-something and thirty-something club/bar hoppers looking to have a good time.  Sundays during football season are awesome.  Tailgating on the lawn is probably some of the most fun I have at Westgate. If you've never been, you have to try out this place."}
{"text":"This place is like the great lost city of Atlantis that was buried beneath the sea before people ever moved into it.  Or like some great monument to civic pride built in Chernobyl  shortly before large quantities of radioactive particles were inadvertently released into the atmosphere and it had to be abandoned too quickly to even demolish it first.  It feels good to be so dramatic!  But seriously, it is a waste of resources.  For example, the surrounding Glendale Public School District services a population of students wherein 87% receive free and/or reduced price lunches...and every single school in the district receives designated funds from the federal government to compensate for funds that simply cannot be supplied by taxpayers local to this area.  The few establishments that actually seem to be in operation are restaurants and bars that are grossly overpriced considering these facts.  Try to enjoy your 10.00 beer from Saddle Ranch now.  And on top of all that, it's completely devoid of culture.  Like Mill Avenue with only 1/8th of the amount of people.  And there's cockroaches.  The last time I was there I was using the toilet and had to step on one before it crawled up my leg.  Then it's legs and bloody bug guts got stuck to my shoe. Much like a metaphor for Westgate City Center."}
{"text":"A security guard (looked a little asian) working with an african american security guard, was far less than professional. He approached my motorcycle and I approached him, leaving my friends and dinner halfway thru at Saddle Ranch. As we discussed a parking issue, that was silly, he became irate. He was yelling and cussing to the point it drew all of the attention of everyone eating on the patio. My friend came over right away to diffuse the situation. The security guard started doing the same to him, so much so that his colleage had to tell him to calm down. He told me I was trespassing and was going to try to get the owner of Saddle Ranch to never let me there again. The security guard also told me if he saw me on any Bike Nights, he would ban me from those as well. I never once raised my voice or cussed ir anything to him. I am a computer engineer for a healthcare company. Never been in any trouble and show EVERYONE respect. Be careful, security at westgate might have a bad day or something and take it out on you. Best bet, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The multiple reviews regarding poor parking are spot-on. I always try to avoid coming here when there's something going on at the stadium, because I know people are going to flood the parking lots... And either I'll end up parking on the other end of the lot or across the street - after searching for fifteen minutes - or I'll have to pay a ridiculous $15 for a spot - or both.  One brilliant reviewer snidely remarked that if you don't like the parking situation, you simply shouldn't come here and definitely shouldn't have the NERVE to leave a negative review over it. I'm not sure what they think the point of Yelp is... The purpose of leaving a review is to inform other potential customers of any issues you had, so they can work to avoid them, and it also serves as a means of bringing larger issues (such as parking) to the attention of the property owners so that they can actually be FIXED.  Yes, actively avoiding the area during large events is a great way to avoid the issue. But it shouldn't be necessary. The stadium has its own parking lot that was built specifically to accommodate the capacity of the stadium itself - parking in neighboring lots therefore shouldn't be affected by it, and certainly not to this extent. Last time I got caught in this type of situation, all the high-clearance vehicles eventually resorted to mounting the curbs and parking in the grass areas. That should be a clear indication that something's wrong with either the parking lot size, or (more likely) the parking system in general.  My only current solution to this problem, without completely avoiding the area: Take the motorcycle. Two wheels are better than four, anyway."}
{"text":"Westgate is the right complex in the wrong time.    No, no, I'm not suggesting it would have worked better ten years ago when there was even less out at 99th Avenue and Bethany than there is now, I'm thinking that this place was just built too soon.  The sixties had their strip malls, the eighties had their indoor malls, and the past few years have seen the outdoor malls take over.  Every shopping center has its day.    Westgate is a gorgeous outdoor mall with all the amenities of an indoor one, except the one most needed in Phoenix--air conditioning.    Oh, did I say Phoenix?  I'm sorry, I meant GLENDALE.  Please, don't refer to Glendale as Phoenix.  They hate that.  Seriously.  They hate that so much that they bristled when \"University of Phoenix\" bought the naming rights to the football stadium within their city limits.  I'm not joking.  Stop laughing.  I am serious.  Why doesn't anyone take me seriously?  Yes, yes, I know you just spit water across your desk from all that laughter...go look it up!  Sigh.  It certainly seems sort of silly, but to each their own.  Anyway, back to Westgate.  It really is a beautiful shopping center, done up with fountains at one end and a kiddie splash area at the other, ringed with hotels and two full-size sports arenas, and replete with ample parking on all sides.  The retail shops appear to have commercial office space above them, so you get the feeling you're walking through a dense urban network as you stroll.  There are bars, restaurants, an AMC movie theater complex, a place where you can watch drunk girls fall off a mechanical bull...you name it, they've got it.    The way the parking is handled is confusing at best, you'll never be directed to the same parking area twice, even if you're seeing the same event on different days.  Some days certain lots are reserved for certain events, some days they're reserved for valet, some days they're wide open.  I think the Wizard of Westgate just flips a switch each morning and decides at random how best to prank us hapless customers.  They certainly seem to enjoy keeping us on our toes.  On days without big events (and even on days with big events, if you park far enough away) the parking is free, which I wholeheartedly appreciate.  Being gouged for parking before I even get the chance to get gouged for food really brings me down.  And oh yes, you will be gouged.  Nothing here comes cheap, not the water sold inside the sporting arenas, not the burgers slung at Johnny Rockets.  If you've shopped at any of the chains that have locations here, check the prices and see if you notice a small hike here.    But alas, Westgate came about at the height of the boom.  I recall going to a hockey game when it was bit a dirt lot and thinking \"what the hell is a stadium doing out here in Yuma, and what the hell are they thinking when they propose building a shopping center next door?!\"  What they were thinking is that the boom would continue, tracts of homes would expand westward, and that Westgate would one day mark the center of the population of the Valley.  Not so much.  There are still more sheep than people in much of this area, and even the lucrative area right off this portion of the 101 is mainly undeveloped.  There are no signs of this changing anytime soon, and the fear I have is that by the time the bust DOES end and expansion begins to fill in the odd emptiness around Westgate, it will have past its prime.  Who knows what type of retail area will be popular then (will it be back to indoor malls?  Will we only be able to shop online by then?  Will we have flying cars that will make the trip out here more bearable?), and who knows whether something newer and shinier will appear a few miles down the road.  Or, dare I say it, closer to the rest of civilization?"}
{"text":"This area seemed like a good idea for our night out after several recommendations from locals we met after landing in Phoenix. I will say it could have been fun, but this area is not California tourist friendly. More of an issue with their regulations, but hopefully this can help fellow Californians avoid wasting their night out. If you have a vertical license the bars will not serve you no matter your age. They enforce their laws over federally issued licenses which we thought was a joke at first. It is not and my 23 year old cousin was denied entry and was not served. The bars also lectured us like we should know better. They allow for licenses to not expire for 50 years in Arizona yet have no tolerance for California's policies. Not the bars fault, but they can at least try to be nice and not act like we are underage or using a fake."}
{"text":"Winter skate rink pop-up is a joke. This operation is poorly managed and is NOT young kid-friendly. After paying $29 for the two of us to skate on cheap skates, my 5 y/o first-timer and I were approached multiple times by the ice attendant as he wanted to move us along, at one time saying he would \"help\" her off the ice which we hadn't requested. I asked him to leave us alone 3 times before a talk with the manager (who was reasonable and seems to have gotten the attendant to cease harassing us). This is a skating rink next to Santa so the majority of the skaters were young wobbly kids; this sort of in-your-face approach didn't make sense. They also sold us a ticket for a 2 y/o yet didn't have skates this size (although they assured us they did)."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy lots of bars / restaurants outdoor events theater shopping  bands & more.."}
{"text":"Just a suggestion... you guys should mark your parking areas for event nights. It's very frustrating to pull into a parking lot that says \"Parking $15\" and be told you can't park there unless you are going to such & such event. If you want designated parking lots for designated events, you should start by signs that say \"Supercross Parking Only\" or \"Gypsy Night Parking Only\" or \"prepaid parking only\".  I saw so many people going in circles and being told to go somewhere else. Too bad your city is broke and has to charge up the wazoo to park now."}
{"text":"There are a variety of restaurants, ranging from sports bars to desert shops. Aside from dining, there is also the AMC theatres, a bowling alley at Tavern and Bowl, and a Dave and Busters. I find this an excellent location to visit for any occasion. It is perfect for events ranging from meetings to birthday parties. There is also a beautiful dancing water pool next to the coyotes stadium."}
{"text":"3 stars for proximity and choices for dining before or after a Cards game.   This review is totally w/ a football game in mind.  Wow, thoroughly enjoyed that game against Buffalo...but I digress.  Westgate is mostly dining establishments, definitely not going to keep you busy with shopping, but the energy on game day makes it a fun place to visit.  My teenage daughter really liked the feel of the place and wants to visit with her cousins.  We may try to have lunch and go to a movie at Westgate before heading over to downtown for the opening of Glendale Glitters.  I'm not sure what percentage of development is done for Westgate, there is a lot of vacant land still so I anticipate that in time there will be more, but for a place to kill some time before an event at Jobing or UPIG I enjoyed the Westgate.  One major ding, and possibly at the request of the restaurants:  after the Cards 1st playoff win, we decided to hang around afer the game.  No Colts vs. Bolts on the huge screen outside?  Just adds for Westgate??  What the heck?    I love that folks can hang before the games and watch one of the televised games, crab a hot dog, buy a drink, t-shirt, get their face painted, etc.  The Westgate should really consider continuing it post-game."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the fountain and Yardhouse and the fact I live in walking distance of westgate I would probably never go. There are hardly any stores mostly places to eat but its expensive if you are not eating on happy hour. Also If I didn't live in walking distance I would go because you have to know if an event is going on now, because if it is you gotta pay to park."}
{"text":"This mall was the worst, I came to get a movie and there was no parking at all due to all the hockey game parking.  This is ridiculous..  Going to cancel our movie tickets and not come back here."}
{"text":"Friday night, Super Bowl weekend. Lots of people walking around and enjoying everything Westgate has to offer: restaurants, watching the fountains dance, music/dancing at McFadden's Beach House."}
{"text":"Only came out here for sports games and maybe some shopping and that's it.  Nothing too fancy about the area."}
{"text":"This place has been getting so much play lately I'm starting to get a little jealous.  With the professional volleyball tour now located there and Jordin Sparks shows there every other day - it's really turning into a hub for the Westside.   I went over there to meet a friend (from Surprise) to hangout as this was decided to be a good meeting point.  Westgate sports that whole faux-town square thing that is all the rage in American suburbia.  You'll find a grassy town square (with baby trees offering little to no shade) that kids and families actually hang out in.  You'll find actual middle class shops in contrast to Kierland Commons.   This place isn't exactly my cup of tea, but people at the center seemed to be enjoying it as it was quite busy.  It's a loud bold monstrosity in what seems (at least now) to be the middle of nowhere - like an oasis in the middle of one GIANT parking lot.   The huge AMC movieplex and Renaissance Marriott hotel are the centerpieces here and chain restaurants abound here like Yard House, Gordon Biersch and soon to be built Gardunos.    It's like a smaller version of Kierland with retail on the first floor and office on the upper floors, but more isolated, with not as many stores and with huge Times Square-like billboard ads EVERYWHERE.  It looks really TACKY.  I think if you even stand around long enough you'll find a billboard on your back."}
{"text":"By far one of the best hangouts around Phoenix! The loveliest thing about Westgate is that you don't have to dent your fortune to be entertained. On weekends, they play live music on their lawn area next to a mini water center for kids to play. It's right accross Tanger Outlet Mall and Cabella's sporting goods, for those of you window shoppers. One can duck-watch at their canal or simply browse through, enjoy the ambiance and the giant LED screens. Not to mention there is a water fountain show every hour in front of the Gila River Arena. Westgate is perfect for dates, friends, or family outings!"}
{"text":"A fun place to go for any occasion. Whether celebrating a birthday, out for a dinner, or before or after a sporting event/convert, Westgate doors a great job for options.  The various types of foods available; sushi, bar, etc. offers all types of preferences needed to accommodate any group.  I would recommend Westgate for any local or for any out of towner!"}
{"text":"Great hang out spot! I have lived in the West Valley for over 8 years now and this side needed some entertainment. There's plenty to chose from to fit everyone's budget. I will be going back"}
{"text":"I was surprised at Westgate City Center!  I have no spent any time in Glendale.  We had tickets to a show at the stadium, which is located in City Center.  It was clean, nicely laid out and had a good selection of places to eat.  Great place to chill before or after a games/show"}
{"text":"When there's a game expect to pay 10 bucks for parking even if you're not going to the game. This place is in dire need off more parking, let's say a free parking ramp for people who are shopping or eating out.  We no longer go near this place to eat if there's a game.  Pretty decent selection of restaurants but the drinks at the bars are way overpriced."}
{"text":"Westgate is a very sad excuse for an Entertainment District.  Another prime example of how bad Glendale runs its city.  This place could easily be a Mecca of dining and shops but instead it is a bunch of horrible chain restaurants (Kabuki, Margaritaville, Johnny Rockets), loserville bars (McFaddens, SaddleRanch, Hells Half Acre), and boring shops (Puma, Margaritaville again).  The highlights are Yardhouse and AMC.    I am just baffled they can't get a local restaurant in here like Matts Big Breakfast, Gallo Blanco, Los Dos Molinos, Delux, or anything semi decent that would draw a crowd.  Another great option would be a local brewery.  Maybe the city could reach out to AZ Wilderness, HUSS, Sleepy Dog, Barrio Brewing, SanTan, or any other local brew pub to get people in the area.    They are further downgrading it with outlet malls.  Just what everyone wants.  Lower quality, lower priced, junk straight from the factory.  Beyond idiotic thinking.  Leave the outlets to Anthem, Casa Grande, and other places in the middle of nowhere.  This is a real city we are talking about here.  This is such a waste of business opportunities with the two sports stadiums bringing people in the area.  Glendale get your crap together and elect some new representation that have a vision and can turn this potential gold mine around."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place especially at night. Tons of restaurants and shopping. Beautiful at night because of the lights and water fountain. As for the weekends this place is busy and a great place to go clubbing."}
{"text":"Well this place used to be fun. Now it's full of annoying teenagers. They are loud and annoying, trying to act cool in front of each other with their posse. Also, many ghetto people seem to enjoy going to the bars there."}
{"text":"We love Saddle Ranch during Happy Hour.  All of their drinks (minus bottles of wine) are half off..even the tall drafts!  The appetizers are also half off, we like the big sampler platter that has multiple burgers, wings, ribs, sweet potato fries and onion rings, this platter easily feeds my husband and I as our meal for only $10!  We have never dined there for the regular menu but everything coming out on the trays looks good, although a little pricey."}
{"text":"Hot Rod Night! I loved seeing Westgate buzzing on a Wednesday night. It was literally humming with the sounds of Hot Rod cars. I am not much of a car enthusiast, but it was heart-warming to see families tailgating around these pretty, pristine cars. Westgate welcomes these collectors with their monthly events, and it was nice to such a great turn out. It is good for the community and the Westgate bizzes!"}
{"text":"Situated amidst vast \"parking lagoons,\" (to borrow the words of James H. Kunstler) the Westgate City Center is about as far away as one can get from anything \"city.\"  In this development, one can enjoy chain restaurants, a movie or pseudo-Las Vegas monuments to capitalism (read: giant-sized billboards). However, one will surely not enjoy the randomness and sense of discovery that makes experiencing a true urban environment (i.e. San Francisco, Manhattan, etc.) so worthwhile. At Westgate, the 'city\" is planned. Don't expect to wander upon a trendy boutique, art cinema or bodega. This is a Phoenix strip mall writ large.  I hate the name \"city center\" for this development as it leads one to expect the kind of \"new urbanist\" development present in Reston, Virginia, Seaside, Florida or Portland, Oregon. Those are true live-work-play destinations. They are not surrounded by \"parking lagoons.\"  Come to Westgate for a cartoon of Disneyland or Las Vegas in metro Phoenix, but go elsewhere for a true urban experience."}
{"text":"Westgate survives as a bar and restaurant district not because of the 41 nights a year the Coyotes play at Jobing.com Arena, but because this is the only place to hang out west of Central.  Virtually every retailer at Westgate has closed up shop, and the only businesses that survive are bars and restaurants that generate most of their profit from alcohol sales.  Tanger Outlets is just another ho-hum outlet mall, and with 4 outlet malls now competing in the Phoenix area, Tanger's long term success is less than assured.  I usually visit Westgate early in the evening, taking advantage of the happy hour deals at Yardhouse, in fact Yardhouse is the only Establishment in Westgate City Center that I have actually dined at.  That may change when Buffalo Wild Wings opens.  When I consider staying later into the evening, I notice some of the clientele and am reminded that Desert Sky is only 4 miles away.  Another glaring example of Westgate's early decline is the content of Steve Ellman's billboards.  The area could be a Times Square west if the content of the billboards was luxury electronics, cars, cosmetics etc.  The sad reality is that half the billboards are for Gila River Casinos, and even the exact price of cremation is advertised on one of  the billboards.  The new lease agreement for the Coyotes includes a minimum $15 parking fee at Westgate during events at Jobing.com Arena.  The impact of this charge on Westgate's price sensitive clientele will probably be substantial, along with the amount of traffic at Westgate, and may force out several marginal businesses.   I haven't seen any details of how and where the parking fees will be collected, so I will update this review once the parking fees go into effect."}
{"text":"Bike night Thursday. Drooled over the Kawasaki H2, Turbo out of the factory is insane. A nice walk around the fountains of youth."}
{"text":"This is an overpriced tourist trap filled with chain everything... the only thing that i liked about this place was that it was attached to jobing.com arena, cardinal stadium and they had outdoor entertainment (performers)... Ohhh and the cremation advertisement was pretty funny as well.  If you want to go to a game here parking is partially free during games. However in some areas it is $25 or more!!! yeah I was totally surprised by this... So if you show up early, its free, if you dont you pay! This mall is multiple stories of restaurants, shops, a theater, and who knows what all else.   Pro Tip: Avoid this place unless you are going to a game here...  This place is also good for one last thing, people watching. I was laughing pretty hard as a couple of girls wearing lingerie and fishnets strolled by on their way to a bar. What was super funny was they were not the type of ladies you would want to see wearing lingerie and fishnets out and about in public. Perhaps this is the only city around where this is not out of the norm and no one, I repeat no one did a double take.  Seriously Phoenix and its surrounds are super unique and have some very humerus moments to say the least. So keep your eyes peeled if you come here and if not, count yourself pretty dayem smart... The restaurant I went to here really sucked as well..."}
{"text":"Two words: Zombie mall. As if going to a successful mall weren't bad enough, this one adds the unavoidable stench of failure to the outing. The place is doing maybe 10% of the business it needs to break even, I'd say. A good number of closed storefronts. Lots of activity on game nights, but then the place is crammed full of loud-mouthed douchebags. So if that's your cup of tea....  On the upside: Plenty of free parking!  It's sad that just when it seemed Glendale (the Valley's raggedy stepsister) might have something going for it... this is what they get. If you're in this part of town, head east on Glendale Ave and go to the \"historic\" downtown, which they've done a pretty good job with. La Perla is still a solid dinner joint. Whatever you do, run away from the plastic brand-name chain shops in this Westgate place, unless you like that sort of thing, in which case you'd probably be just as happy going to your nearest Applebee's, so why drive farther?"}
{"text":"My first time coming here was a disaster. Came just to have my son get his photo with Santa. It was a Sunday around 11am and it costs 10$ to park because of the cardinals game nearby. I didn't have cash. I went to three different employees asking where to go to see Santa none of them knew what they were doing, and then directed me to an atm machine to get money to park except that atm machine didn't exist. The event staff has no idea what they are doing. Keep the cardinals parking at the stadium and leave the people who are shopping alone!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just because I'm from Las Vegas and we don't have any of the super awesome cool stuff they have here in Phoenix metro, but this place is super awesome! I mean seriously. A movie theater, lots of shops and dinning, fountains and lights everywhere anchored by a huge arena with an awesome Coyotes hockey team inside. What more can you ask for?! Miuns one star because of the location (I'm spoiled, not use to driving more than 15 minutes to anything), and also the selection of stores and restaurants seem a little short. It feels like there is suppose to more to this. Other than that, I'm for sure a fan of this awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Boring. It's a City Walk wanna be.  Pretty much against my will I came out here because one of Mike's friend's was in town and staying with someone who lived out here. I was hoping to convince them to meet in the middle and go downtown, but no luck. I don't get why you would take an out-of-towner here when it's nothing, but chains, but whatever.   There's nothing special about this place. It was very bright and they blocked off the road between Saddle Ranch and Margaritaville, although I'm not sure why because I didn't think the area was that busy. The only plus here was the parking was free."}
{"text":"Great for out of towners going to games at Jobing dot com arena or U. of Phoenix Stadium. Food inside the stadium is disappointing so we recommend you either tailgate or go to Westgate before or after.  Sight lines inside the stadium were good but in the far reaches of the terrace section (row 17), I felt the lighting on the field was weak (take binoculars if you are that high, we did).  We attended the NFC Championship game and stayed nearby at the Marriott Summerhill Suites. Made stops walking along the way, slightly off site at Cabella's (Disneyland for both NRA and REI types),  Cracker Barrel, (awesome breakfasts where cholesterol is not an issue) and Gordon Biersch Brewery (folks, a second or even third location does not constitute a chain). They brew the beer on site, for crying our loud. Heifeweisen was excellent, as was the service.   I'm a fan of the Westgate as well. It's garish in a Phoenix kinda way, where they like...built a city in a desert, y'know. But as a public space, it works, the way piazza's in Italy work... pedestrian friendly meeting and shopping spaces.  We had great gellato, sushi, and would have gone to Yardhouse, which in addition to beers from everywhere on tap has an excellent menu. Try all the small plates sometime with friends.  Even in our Eagles garb, folks were friendly and not mean.  I don't understand the meaning of the huge Vegas style ad boards on top, but they did light the space well. From the second level, looking down on the dancing fountains was a treat. Phoenix has a world class facility that others should emulate. Now go forth Cardinals and beat the Steelers."}
{"text":"um.. old people place? lol sorry everyone, but if its not rocking out some recent rock or hip hop.... its older people place.  Not sure what to expect since I'm coming from LA, I guess not as bad of a review unless I lived in Vegas uh? haha  But this place on a Saturday night has lots of people but since the place is so huge & has such wide open areas... it really looked like the center needed more people.  Parking: Plenty Atmosphere: Billboards are probably more trendy then the whole happening areas.  Crowd is older than 30+, so no messed up rowdy annoying high schoolers or college crowds around?  Respectful & fun still, its what you make of it right?  Genuinely nice people.   I mean I think I'm being really nice for giving 1+ star.  Seems like everyone else in AZ is rating near the same I rate it =/  Still a place to check out though.  And if you're a tourist, probably a good place to still check out since theres alot of restaurants & such.  So thinking this place's age crowd ranges from 30+?"}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I have been here a few times, whenever I am in town.  it's a great place to have a date night, walk around, people watch, and get some drinks.    This district is very cool and has a great atmosphere.  There is a variety of things to do in terms of bars, restaurants, shops.    I would highly recommend, however, for management to bring back a place like the \"Shout House\".  It was a home grown feeling of fun.  Everything other place now there, just seems to be a little pricey, stuffy, or not as good old fun."}
{"text":"I think people are overly-critical of Westgate.   To me, it is just one of many outdoor-style shopping and entertainment districts in Arizona. They are nearly identical. Movie theaters, chain restaurants, some retail stores, lots of parking, and some type of water feature for kids to play in while their parents sit down and watch them.   For Westgate, the only difference is that it sits at the foot of two professional sports stadiums (Cardinals and Coyotes), which makes parking and nights out a nightmare for folks who aren't going to a game.   Why?  Parking and crowds. That's why.   Other than that, I find Westgate to be a decent alternative to other shopping areas in the west valley. Better than Crossroads at Tolleson or P83 in Peoria (worst name ever by the way). My only other advice would be to not come for a movie and dinner on a night that the Coyotes or Cardinals are playing. Parking is nearly impossible and it will likely cost you to do it.   My only other criticism with Westgate is the fact that the area around it still hasn't developed into the west valley utopia that it was supposed to become. It feels empty out there still. I know there are the standard suburban complexes nearby, but the emptiness and wind still make me feel like Westgate is in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"Despite the nice layout, design, and store variety of the City Center, I was still heartily disappointed. Some friends and I were merely trying to find a parking spot to do some shopping and things of the sort when we were notified that it was going to cost us a hefty $30 to park in a MALL parking lot. Outrageous. Turns out the WWE was in town and I guess they wanted to get some extra cash out of the mullet sporting, dentally challenged fans of Wrestlemania. Cool I guess, but not for us that were just trying to buy some swag. They offered some sort of validation system to reclaim some of the $30 coughed up, but it all seemed more than shifty in nature so we decided to park elsewhere.   Everything else about this nice outdoor shopping center is exceptional. So waddya say Westgate? Create a better system for those of us not there for the events at the stadium across the way?"}
{"text":"Westgate wasn't too bad as it was actually kinda of cool to come out of the arena after the hockey game on 3/2 into the plaza with the fountains right in the center.  What I like that Phoenix ( Downtown ) lacks is all the places you can hit up to eat and or drink after the game and or concert.  Don't get me wrong there are places to go in Phoenix after a game but its virtually a ghost town after a night game.  However, there is a cool spot to go in the same plaza as Chase Field prior to a ballgame especially an afternoon game.  Back in Glendale once you walk out of the arena you are walking into action and we almost caught a movie but then decided against it but that's what Westgate is all about.  Plenty to do before and after the game.  One major disappointment is that after the game we wanted to eat at Johnny Rockets because the food in the arena was disgusting.  Anyways, we walk into the restaurant and I would say at least 70% of the restaurant dining area was messy with food left on the table from previous diners.  Keep in mind that it was obvious that the restaurant had a major rush but come on that is unacceptable to have a messy dining room that bad and to top it off as messy as it was they certainly should have had more than one person cleaning.  In closing, Westgate is the wannabe Scottsdale.  Westgate don't have shit on Scottsdale but for the WESTSIDE its great and doable.  Next time I will definitely arrive 2-3 hours before game time ( Hockey ) and enjoy dinner and some drinks."}
{"text":"DATE NIGHT CENTRAL. So much to choose from, I loved it here! Free parking was a plus and the live music on the grass yard was very fun to listen to and watch."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to bring out towners. Fountain show is a must.  But lately all the shops seem to be closed. What's happening to this place. So much potential. Arizona needs a cool attraction like this especially in the west valley. Please don't let this place fade, keep it kicking."}
{"text":"My home away from home. Great bars and food, shopping, girls, and douchebags. Alittle bit of everything"}
{"text":"Oh, Westgate Center...  I live just down the street from this shiny mecca of overpriced, mediocre chains. While I have never attended a sporting event or concert here I do frequent a few of the establishments within this development periodically. If you must eat here I recommend Kabuki (Japanese) or the Yard House (American, upscale pub food with an impressive beer and liquor menu). My boyfriend and I attended the 2011 New Year's Eve event here with a few friends for two reasons: 1)we had just moved here and 2) were too exhausted to do much of anything else. That was a huge mistake! I felt slightly misled as to what we were gaining access to upon paying for admission. Our admission allowed us to only stand in the middle of the common area and listen to a band and pay for a fairly expensive, limited variety of cocktails. All of the bars and restaurants had their own separate cover. Call me crazy, but that seems like a ridiculous business plan. It would have made more sense if they had raised the cover and allowed all of those people to flow freely through the restaurants and bars that Westgate offers. Don't be so stingy Westgate!"}
{"text":"Great place a ladies night out! I love how the complex is always clean and security handling business!"}
{"text":"Cover charge for bars on top of over priced drinks. Someone compete against this place!!"}
{"text":"Omigod I can only give this place two stars because the Waterdance feature is pretty awesome. Otherwise, after spending the previous four days in Sedona the billboards alone were a complete shock to my system. What Blade Runner freak dreamt this crazy place up??? Ugh. Great for teeny boppers and kids - oh, and the pseudo hip-hops who don't mind cops outside the Hell's Half Acre bar..."}
{"text":"I have no problem with this place, very convenient when you want to eat, watch a movie. Even if you're at a Coyotes or Cardinal game, you can get a bite or drink before or after the game. Has a nice selection of shop to browse through! Quick tip, there are other restaurants across the streets or further up on their parking lot. They can use more shops, but this can really be a nice place."}
{"text":"Okay Westgate is cool but really when ever did a public place close expeccially a parking lot? The cops force you to leave no matter if you saying goodbye to a loved one or not if it's after 12 you better leave right away or be forced by police....I'm sorry but if you need to kick people out you need to get gates to lock up at the end of the night, it's not right when people just want to talk to their friends they have bars there but we can't talk to our friends!"}
{"text":"If you build it they will come.  Westgate Entertainment District is a  great place to come, relax and enjoy hanging out.  Westgate offers a variety of dining establishments and refreshments as you stroll around the district enjoying the sights and sounds.   There is so much to do at Westgate Entertainment District. I really enjoy sitting in front of the waterfalls and watching the water fountains that are synchronized to music. My nephew likes the splash pad especially on those hot summer days.  Westgate has a AMC movie theater, large variety of restaurants, arts &crafts,  and specialty shops to choose from, and did I mention the Tanger Outlets are right across the street within walking distance.  If you have some time to spare; Westgate  is a great place to do it."}
{"text":"Westgate is a great place to go, day or night.  We spent the whole day there, starting with lunch at an outdoor patio, sunny day, watching the world go by.  Did some shopping, came back for dinner at The Yard House, went to go see a Coyotes hockey game, then hung out rest of the evening and enjoyed the night time atmosphere with music playing, people all about.    You can also go to the movies, and there's even a Dave & Busters. Was a great day, something for everyone."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Westgate New Year's Eve celebration last night only to be extremely disappointed.  Entry into the outdoor area was $20 or $10 if bought in advance, then every bar charged an additional $25-$50 cover charge.  The drink prices were about what we expected, but selection at the bars outside was extremely limited.  The band, Metalhead was less than average.  They reminded me of some garage bands I heard back in the day.  The \"countdown\" to midnight started 5 mins early, then it stopped and restarted again.  Less than climatic to say the least.  Needless to say, we will not return next year and recommend if you are thinking about going to this you should reconsider."}
{"text":"FREE live music in the courtyard every Saturday night 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. in front of AMC theatres/Westgate.  Ghangi's Garage band is excellent. Love their old school cover songs. They sound great! I LOVE the architecture, water fountains, landscaping and many restaurants and HH places, AMC and other things out here. It is just really sad that this place isn't promoted to bring in many to visit. It can at times be abandoned-like to super slamming crowded from the events at Jobing Arena. :)"}
{"text":"To all you Scottstitutes,  We've noticed that ever since Westgate opened, you've been quite the fixture at your modest, trendy over-priced hellhole of a strip mall. We really do appreciate your company, and we especially appreciate all of that fancy Scottsdale money you keep throwing at all the local businesses. But I'm getting the feeling that you're still not \"getting\" it. There seems to be some misunderstandings and misconceptions about Westgate, and I would like to take this opportunity to clear some of them up for you.  1) I don't care how expensive your meal or that new pair of Pumas was, you're still on the west side. Hence all the CHAINS. That 40 dollar bottle of face cream your girlfriend just got could've been bought at Arrowhead Mall.   2) This is NOT your neighborhood. Don't let the condos and 12 dollar appetizers fool you. One step outside of the parking lot and you're in the fucking jungle, my friend. And the jungle is a \"no popped collar\" zone. I've looked into it.   3) While some of the businesses may seem to have been imported from Scottsdale, the uninspired employees who work at these establishments are definitely not. You may have noticed that when you try to park in certain public spaces by the stadium, you'll be approached by grizzled men in \"parking staff\" shirts demanding that you pay them to park in \"their\" area. Or that when you complain to the waiter that your meal is being rained on by a leaky pipe, he just laughs and offers you a napkin. This is the west side, sucka. As Dracula once said, \"our ways are not your ways\".  4) While the tragically underdressed plebians and their families roaming the strip mall may be unsightly and crude, the fact is THEY LIVE HERE.   5) Don't bitch about how happy hour is so crowded. This is the only time that the aforementioned locals can afford to eat at all these fine establishments.   6) If the piano bar on the second level charges you a cover, it's probably because they don't think your girlfriend is all that hot. Or because you don't have one in the first place. Oh, burned by the doorman!  7) If there's a wait to get a table at Yardhouse, the last thing you should do is walk back and forth by the patio waiting for a table to magically open up. It only entices those with a table to order more booze and keep their table longer.   8) If you're afraid of clowns or people in stilts, don't go to Margaritaville before a game/concert. They can sense your fear and will only use it against you.  9) While it may be tempting, do not make out on the escalator, no matter how hard the mood strikes you. There is a 80 percent chance that some teenager is running as fast as fast as he can to go in the opposite way on the one you're on.   10) If you're going to ask me what time it is, at least have the common fucking sense to hide your watch. if you can't figure out what I am, then you can stand by the restrooms and see which one I go into, like all the other sane people do.  Thank you/go fuck yourself, Jetta"}
{"text":"This 3 star rating of mine is more for how pretty the fountains and lights are more than anything else. The thing about this place that annoys me to no end is the fact that the entire parking lot here is basically dedicated to game parking on game days. So regardless of whether you are going to the game or not going to the game, you will end up paying a great $10 to park here. You might be going to the movies, shopping, or eating, but you will have to pay $10 to use the parking lot, which mind you, is already inundated with hundreds of cars looking for game day parking."}
{"text":"I'm going to defy the norm here:  Westgate is superb.  There are a ton of dining options, bars, a movie theater, and it is very close the the football stadium (and it is joined to the hockey arena).  There aren't many retail shops though.  The Yardhouse is definitely my top choice for happy hour.  Kabuki runs the second best happy hour on a Friday and Buffalo Wild Wings has their wing specials on Tuesday and Thursday.  I also enjoy getting my haircut at MUG, where you get the extra perks (razor finish with a hot towel and massage).  The movie theater is also generally solid.  The center courtyard also has a fountain/ play area where kids usually run through in their bathing suits as their parents relax in the surrounding sofas.    So, there are definitely some good options here that have kept me coming back for more."}
{"text":"If your going to see the Phoenix Coyotes at Jobing.com arena.....or the Arizona Cardinals at the University of Phoenix stadium....then you you can't really miss the experience that is the Westgate City Center. Now it is not a spectacular mall by any means...and the parking is a bit confusing...but it does have it's own flair and style. During the summer months it is the perfect place to go after a game or event at the stadiums...because you can grab some dinner....a drink...take a nice walk....or just hang out and watch the stars in the beautiful skies over Glendale Arizona.  The best part about all of this along with the close proximity to the stadiums.....is the parking is FREE....can't beat that. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what people want out of this mall but it suits my needs just fine.   After a game I can go to the movies. Before the game I can eat and have a few cheaper priced drinks. We can hang out at the Piano bar without kids (ASU) starting fights. I can eat, drink and dance at Margaritaville and not be worried about having a good time.   Trendy... meh, you can't fill a mall with Mom and Pop type places.  Ghost mall... just like everywhere else.  Parking... Open and FREE  This place has no culture like Cen Pho but it can be a good time."}
{"text":"The only reason I ever come way out this way is if I'm going to see a concert at Jobing.com Arena. I don't really see any other reason to. Sure, there are a bunch of restaurants, and  I think some shopping, but it's only there to kill time before or after a show.   The parking here is THE WORST EVER if you're coming for a concert. Especially if there is also a football game happening next door. There are a ton of people directing traffic, but none of them are aware of what the other is doing. We sat in one spot for, no joke, like 20 minutes. Meanwhile we could see a parking lot not even half full right next to the road we were stuck on. Once we finally made it into the parking lot, there was no discernible reason for the traffic besides the people directing it stopping it for their own amusement. It's a nightmare.  I almost decided to just say \"fuck it\" and leave because of the horrible traffic.  Leaving wasn't too bad, except you have the same problem but in reverse. The traffic directors trying to control traffic, and the drunk and tired people completely ignoring them. Then once you get onto a major road, they have half the lanes blocked off for no apparent reason.   Other than the terrible traffic, this place is all right. If you come on a night where there is a sold out show, be prepared for waits up to an hour and a half at every single restaurant.   Eat and pee before you get here and bring a flask and you're good to go."}
{"text":"Westgate has Jobing.com arena, university of Phoenix stadium, tanger outlets,amc movie theater and plenty of restaurants all this places at a walking distance, how can this not be rated 5 stars.  Any other place in az that can match this? Methinks not"}
{"text":"Really fun entertainment complex that provides plenty of dinning options before/after a Coyotes or Cards game. Also has some excellent common areas where you can enjoy just hanging out and enjoying the weather. We spent a good 45 minutes coming Westgate until the Yotes game started. Fun place to hang out, if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here. Although, the parking situation has became RIDICULOUS!!! When there are events at west gate it is absolutely hard to find parking; it took me about 45 minutes to 1 hour to find parking. Although there is some places to park you have to pay $15, which is very irritating. I would give a better review if they would open more free parking. Do not come to west gate you will waste your time because there will be no parking."}
{"text":"Compare to places in Chicago and other states, this outdoor mall area is really nice.  Kind of reminds me of Hollywood with the fountains and huge billboards everywhere.  It's clean, a lot of security and free parking.  It's nice just to walk around and maybe grab a bite to eat at one of the many restaurants and bars in the area."}
{"text":"Ive been many times to westgate and am soo dissapointed everytime,first of all if u want any thing to drink other than a beer forget about it,none of the bartenders there have any clue how to make a drink and wont even try,the food at all the places is GARBAGE ive tryed different stuff on all the menus and its all gross..the bars are full of kids and the servers and bartenders are rude and incompetent..the yard house is probably the only place worth going to there but expect to spent at least 60 dollers for a couple drinks and an appetizer,'hells half acre' is a scottsdale lounge wanna be with incredibly unattractive waitresess dressed in lingerie,'the shout house' duel piano bar is murder on the ears,also the entire place is CRAWLING with cops stairing you down and u gotta wear a bracelet to get in the places gently placed on u by one of the cop wanna be 'bouncers' at the door who eyeball u up and down before going in..westgate is not a fun time at all,,go to tempe or scottsdale instead."}
{"text":"the parking is absolutely horrible if they have a sporting event.  even though you're not attending the event and just would like to have dinner or catch a movie they block off 80% of the parking area for sports attendees to pay. but instead of the sport attendees rather park in the free areas.  they need a better system.  reopen all of the parking areas once the game has started.  whoever is in charge needs to be fired."}
{"text":"In the last decade, there has been a proliferation of locations like this around the country.  This one is near the Glendale Sports Complex, so it should attract a lot of out of towners.  If I was a local, I don't think I'd come here often.  It is pretty touristy.  Selection of shops and restaurants is OK, but nothing special.  Parking is plentiful and free.  I find it curious that they also have a free shuttle to the local outlet mall.  OK to stop if you want to seek out one of the shops or restaurants, but would not be a good place to browse."}
{"text":"My cousins were in town this past weekend and insisted we do some club crawling at West Gate. I was half sold on the idea as I had just returned home from NYC. I was exhausted and running on fumes but I agreed; with regrets of course.    Although the property is nice and the weather could not have been better I really don't know how people can afford to go out on the town. Every bar/restaurant had a cover charge and absolutely no drink specials to be found anywhere. Where I come from, 2-4-1 specials are the norm and you can always count on a shot special too. Not here! I was broke after 5 stops at 5 bucks a pop and a round of drinks costing me 25 to 35 bucks...I was so sticker shocked I couldn't even work up a slight buzz.   We also went to a club which I would say could qualify as uber-ghetto.  I've not seen that much twerking since...well, hmm never mind...Let's just say way more than what I need to see for a lifetime. These people were out of control. I was standing there with my group and it was so crowded, I was soaking wet from booze all the way down my back into my favorite leather loafers.  I even observed someone smash a glass in the middle of the dance floor and just kept right on dancing. This shiz was unbelievable.   Fast forward to the next morning, I discovered scratches on my calves and the back of my shirt was stained from what must have been vodka-crans, Jaeger bombs, big-butt beers (yes, they have those) and who knows what else. One things for sure, it wasn't my doing.    All I know is this was one big fat been-there-done-that for me. West Gate and your overpriced douchey establishments... no thank you, I'll stay put in my bubble."}
{"text":"Westgate has a few more restaurants now but stil need more shops for shopping to come along.  It is starting to build up but slowly.  It was nice to walk around from dinner, but the amount of teenage kids there were a little annoying.  Guess I am not the mommy type!"}
{"text":"Men walking around with a smile on their face saying please shoot me I hate my life. The women hanging on there mans arm with a smile on her face cause she has him trapped in her living hell, with their 2.5 beastly children running around driving every other patron of the place nuts while mom & dad ignore them. Yeah, let's go shopping for cheap clothes and home goods made in a third world country by an eight year old child, or let's eat a place that you can eat at anywhere in the USA and not taste a drop of seasoning!"}
{"text":"Yard house.... and Gordon Biersch  I don't care for any of the shops to be quite honest with you.  would i drive out of my way to go to west gate for a girls night out or anything??  Or even for a dinner date with my man? NOT A CHANCE!  Way too far for me, and nothing that exciting. Its justa mediocre spot for me. I go there if I really HAVE too. When some one says west gate, I think Ugh...Nooo =[ DEFINITELY NOT worth a 30-40 minute drive. If i lived close by then that might be my only option but since I don't i have far more places here in chandler that keep me plenty satisfied and my wallet content."}
{"text":"Lots to do, great for people watching, huge sports stadium, ample parking, beautiful fountain!"}
{"text":"Always have a great time at Westgate! There is shopping, restaurants and entertainment all here. Catching a hockey game is a MUST DO while here. The hockey arena is a lot nicer than what I am used to, and more family oriented than adults which I also am not used to with hockey LOL... I have been to many sports facilities in my time and this is the only one that offers plenty of parking and amazing places to go chill at before and/or after games. Westgate is kept clean, has fun festivals offered, and has two fountains, there's even one that you can walk through to cool off. Most of the restaurants have patios to enjoy people watching and taking in the scenery. There are also taxi cabs lined up to take you home if needed, never need to call one or wait. I love having Westgate so close to my house!"}
{"text":"This is the second time here and we have to park a mile away all the parking lots are blocked off and the parking spaces are cone off again. When you walk around everything smells like sewer. Couple of businesses we talked to didn't seem happy to be here.. I think the high prices will just keep us out from now on."}
{"text":"Your parking is fucken ridiculous. Relocate your events if you don't have enough space for everything surrounding your area."}
{"text":"Awful, oppressive place to visit. Extremely rude and unfriendly security. Was asked to leave for taking photographs of a Bride who was spending thousands on her wedding right next door at the Renaissance Phoenix Glendale Hotel & Spa, which is, one would assume, part of the Westgate Entertainment District. An absolute joke. A mean spirited security guard woman told us we were trespassing on private property and that we could be arrested for not having a permit. Seriously? What about all the people around us taking cell phone photos of the fountains? Do they need permits as well? Power hungry security guards harassing people with no real consistency or accountability. No wonder the Coyotes have a dispute with the city of Glendale because they are clueless. This is not how you promote Westgate as a tourist destination, by the way. Virtually everyone in our wedding party said they would never buy an over-priced beer again at a Westgate bar or restaurant. Good job, Glendale. Can't wait until the Coyotes leave and this place becomes a wasteland and its security guards are forced to patrol the outlet mall."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to go when you want to get out and people watch, plus keep your kids entertained. An outdoor mall of sorts, perhaps more accurately an outdoor food court?   There is a huge movie theater, more popular franchise restaurants and a few smaller places to eat. Our favorite area is the main pavilion, where comfortable outdoor furniture (shade included) surrounds a large splash pad.   I have only been here a handful of times, but my family and I enjoyed ourselves! During certain parts of the year, there is a small car show on Wednesday nights, so of course my husband and I had to check it out!"}
{"text":"They are advertising this place as the \"Times Square of the West.\" Clearly, they have not been to New York.  There is nothing that Westgate Center has in common with Times Square.  The parking lot is huge, but badly arranged.  Even the handicapped spots were a long walk for one of my friends  The plaza is anchored by sports/concert venues.  When there are no sports events or concerts to bring in the traffic, there is a large movie theater.  They have also taken a lot of care to make several large public areas with fountains and other attractive focal points.  It is pretty, but an ineffective use of space that fails miserably in its attempt to provide services to concert goers and sports fans.  There were not even enough places available for several coworkers and i to enjoy having lunch there.  The rest of the plaza is supposed to be bustling with entertainment and activity to support the events at the main venues.  It is not.   I thought it was because a lot of places had not opened, but i think the problem is deeper than that. There are several chain restaurants with bars.  Try going to one of those restaurants before your concert for dinner.  They look at you like you have lost your mind.  The problem is, there are so few places, and they are all packed and understaffed.   The ones i tried acted as if they were insulted that i didn't want to wait til after my concert had started to sit down. This wouldn't be bothersome if they were using their entire seating space and had a full staff of waiters, but it looked like there were sections of the places that were not being used at all.  Perhaps they are waiting for the Superbowl to open those remaining 8 tables.  ."}
{"text":"I have to agree with all said by Thomas S.  This is a place filled with \"trendy\" chain restaurants, shops which don't have any reason to exists, and everything is overpriced.  All of this is fine, all of this I take with a grain of salt because of the Coyotes and Cardinals stadium.  But then, there are the people.  Goddamn, the people here are incredibly low class and rude.  Some 35+ balding man decided to cuss me out because I made a U-turn to get a parallel parking spot so I could make the Coyotes game.  Then his parents started in on me and my guy.  Yeah, 55+ men yelling at a 21 yr old girl and her guy.  Real f-ing classy.  I can see why they hang out at Westgate, the other people aren't any better."}
{"text":"Be careful going anywhere here.  On Cardinal game days they charge everyone $20 to park anywhere on the property with the assurance that you will get it refunded if you get a validation from the business you are going to.    Well good luck finding someone with the authority to refund your money.  AMC sent me to Johnny Rocket who sent me to an empty store front with Westgate parking attendants eating lunch.  They sent me to a Westgate office which turned out to be another empty storefront only this one was locked.    There's better places to eat/shop or see a show and with less chance of getting ripped off."}
{"text":"Great environment and clean bathrooms. Nice area to walk around with family during the day and good places to eat. I haven't done the night scene here but during the day it's great. I've been here a few times as a place to stop going to Las Vegas and Sedona from Tucson. We went to the veteran car show and it was huge."}
{"text":"No offense to locals, because Glendale \"Glitters\" with \"Chocolate\" downtown, but this mall hastily developed around the silver Jiffy Popcorn pan  that is University of Phoenix Stadium (misnomer, it is for the professional football team, the Arizona Cardinals, named after the omnipresent UofP distance learning and professional college, ala National University) and the Jobing.com (local based employment dot com) Arena (home to the NHL Coyotes) is really just a North Snobsdale (aka Scottsdale, Snotsdale, She'sGotTail) Kierland Commons Wannabee Mall!  It is 4 stories high, shaped like a football and stadium, with huge billboards facing into the 2 water fountains, its only redeeming value.  It is populated with typical Scottsdale type restaurants....Big on decor, small on taste, with chain restaurants peddling Chef/Designer highly stacked fusion flavors masking average casual food for a larger tab per serving.   Even the hords of young, large bossomed hostesses, bartenders and waitresses in black t-shirts are the attractions that were first ubiquitous in Scottsdale, then downtown Phoenix around the Diamondback Stadium, has now moved to the west side of the Valley! Margarittaville, Johnny Rockets, Fox Sports Grill, Kabuki Japanese...all formula chains for the average masses who think they are getting something special, but aren't.   Meanwhile, the Superbowl early this year, the reason why this complex was completed (and for the new football Stadium) has come and gone, the housing boom has collapsed, and the westside house prices have dropped 30 - 40%. Consequently, within a couple of blocks, the luxury condos are being auctioned off, the Westgate Offices atop the stores are empty, and so are the new office buildings.  The anchor Hotel the Renassaince, also a Westin of Kierland  poser, is nicely lit but largely empty. There is a conference center attached, so it might get some occupancy other than Football season weekends, but the Homewood Suites nearby has got to be a summer bargain hotel.  This is classic Valley gaudiness at its worst. And it is set conveniently off the Loop 101 at Glendale Road near the Agua Fria riverbed, but otherwise it is a vast open field of former farm land. Still, it is the only decent mall within miles, so it is a beacon for the young and bored westsiders looking for something besides their quiet bedroom communities of strip malls and convenience stores."}
{"text":"We saw Santa Clause! Kids had a great time. Very pretty atmosphere. Ice Scating."}
{"text":"How can you not love Westgate??? They really do have it all for everyone!!!   Plenty of places to get a bite to eat. A few places you can enjoy are Southwest Moes, Margarita, Johnny Rockets, Ocean Blue, Cold Stone, a new pizza place that slips my mind, and so much more. If you want BBQ, frozen yogurt, burgers, steak, or what ever else makes you say yum...they have it!   If you have the itch to shop, they can satisfy your every need! I always pop in to Just Sports to see what they have for my favorite Valley team...Go Coyotes!!!   Speaking of entertainment! They have it all... a huge AMC movie complex, first class Jobbing.com Arena (Phoenix Coyotes NHL hockey, concerts, and more), UPS right next door for Cards football, and conventions. Plenty of thirst quenching bars, and one certain days of the week, live music in the splash pad area in front of AMC.   As if you need more...WG is clean, safe, easy to get to from any place in the Valley, and plenty of free parking! I am not the only one who loves this place. Every time my family gets visitors from New York come in, WG is always a must stop!"}
{"text":"I find Westgate's existence very perplexing.   Speaking strictly as an eastsider, I can't image ever coming all the way out to this place for any reason other than an event at the arena or stadium. And even if I were a westsider, I'd probably avoid the place because I'd have to check that there isn't a game or concert going on if I want to go there. The parking situation is an absolute mess if there is an event going on. Somebody please build another access road or two to the Loop 101!   While I like most of the bars and restaurants in Westgate, there's nothing special about them. It's mostly chains that you can find elsewhere in the valley. Some of the shops are unique, but not unique enough to justify a ride out west. Westgate is too big for the hockey crowd, but too small to support the football crowd. Good luck getting into any of the bars before or after a Cardinals game. If you're one of the few who went to see the Coyotes play, the place is all yours after the game is over. You'd also expect there to be more fast food options for the people just trying to avoid high prices inside the venues, but there are only a few.   I will give the designers credit, the place is beautifully set up. The fountains are nice to look at and getting around is simple. It's just too bad it's not in an area that's set up for foot traffic unless there's 60,000 people in the area for a game. And when that's the case, I'd rather stay away from these shops."}
{"text":"Very average food. Overpriced 7.00 draft. Mostly bud products 12.00 burger. No towels in bathroom no hd tv for college football. Even ripped/worn out menus.   After the game went back... the group I was with wanted to party in the area and this was the only place you could get in. The band was good.  I was amazed that the bartenders would not let you buy more than one beer at a time. Cant buy one for your date unless they come to the bar with you. Really stupid and I have never seen this outside an arena.  There are too many choices in this complex to waste your money here."}
{"text":"Plenty of chain restaurants and bars to keep people entertained for pre- or post- fun when going to the Jobing.com Arena or UoP Stadium. There is a spot on the west side of the City Center where all the scalpers hang out, off the sidewalk by the parking lot. We've gotten some good tickets pretty cheap from them.  I like hanging out at one of the restaurants or bars after a game and wait out the traffic. The nearby Yardhouse is my personal fav for the selection of beers, don't expect any place in that area to have cheap drinks on a game day. I'm not sure about other days though."}
{"text":"Neat place to go, at least to say you have been there. Best on off days and hours!  Could use more/better parking.  Many places to eat - but most overpriced! Turns into a \"club scene\" later in the evenings. But they often have a band playing outside in the courtyard area from 6:30 - 9:30 Friday and Saturdays.. Bring lawn chairs if you want to sit, they could use more seating.  There is a shuttle from in front of the AMC theatres over to the Tanger Outlet if you want to bounce back and forth.  I think this place was ultimately built and businesses are looking to cash in for the upcoming Super Bowl. It will be interesting to see what becomes of it after that..?  They definitely need more attractions and events to draw the people in. Car shows, bike shows and bands are a great start!"}
{"text":"I like that we have a sports venue in the West Valley, I think that this place has tons of more potential but under the current recession it will take time to recover and get the growth we need all around this place.  I love that Cabelas is over here and 2 movie theaters nearby.  I enjoy the food options when we are in this area and sometimes drive out of my way to come here since Park West is also nearby on 101 & Northern.  We came here this weekend and the kids walked around with us and we enjoy all the fountains and the kid area where children can play in the water."}
{"text":"I really don't like this place it's overrated and kind of annoying how the bars here think they are all that and wanting to charge $40 more or less just to come inside and grab a drink.  This whole place made me laugh and was definitely a waste of my time walking through here the only place that wasn't charging a cover to visit their establishment was Yard House and they were packed props to them for not trying to exploit drunk people for financial gain!  Do yourself a favor and avoid Westgate it's a waste of time, money, & and their is nothing here really except a bunch of bars that think they are all that!"}
{"text":"Edit: the Marketing Director responded saying (among other things) \"...We are proud to support mothers who breastfeed. It is our responsibility to ensure all team members are aware of this property-wide breastfeeding policy and we will internally discuss and reiterate this immediately...\"  I thank you, Jessica.  Do NOT give Westgate your business! I was hidden in the back alley nursing my 8 month old son and security (Smith) told me to cover up since I could \"offend someone\" (My son rips covers off and I am always very discreet when it comes to nursing). When I asked to speak to the supervisor, she told me I had to cover up since it is \"private property.\" I asked if she wanted my business and she said \"we want your business, but we don't want your business doing THAT.\""}
{"text":"Reading through the reviews, lots of people really seem to hate this place because of the chain restaurants, unclassy clientele and the bad parking.  Well, then go somewhere else!  For us, we don't enjoy hanging out at the bars on a Friday or Saturday night.  But, we do work late, so the fact that there are decent places to eat late at night during the week, really works for us.  Yard House has always had decent food, with a huge list of options.  You can pretty much get whatever you're in the mood for.    Saddle Ranch Chop House is a bit loud for me, and I could really do without the bull, but again, they have some decent food, and lots to choose from.  I had never been to Buffalo Wild Wings until the other night.  It was very good!  We had a super-nice waitress, which always makes any dining experience so much better.  The cheese curds were yummy (they don't even need the sauce).  And, hubby and I shared a large wings, we each picked 2 sauces.  I'm a fan of the honey BBQ!  For the others, Shane's Rib Shack...so good!  Which Wich...not a fan.  Chipotle...I actually preferred when it was Moe's.  Kabuki...pretty good.  Now, for the lack of one star...do not like McFadden's.  Went there once, and never again!  Ditto for Margaritaville!  I'm originally from South Florida, so I've been to the original one in Key West.  I got so excited when they opened out here, but that soon went away.  The servers were horrid, and the food was just bad.  Plus, considering they're supposed to be a bar-type restaurant, they're one of the few that close really early.   We still haven't tried Whiskey Rose or Calico Jack's.  Calico Jack's is advertised, both on their website and on their front door, as being open until 2am every night.  Well, we tried to go there at 12:05am, and they were already closing.  After we'd left Saddle Ranch, a little after 1am, we walked by, and their lights were all off.  If you don't want to stay open until 2am on a Thursday, then don't advertise that you are.  We also enjoy the outer rim restaurants, like Gordon Biersch (yummy!!) and My Big Fat Greek Restaurant (they serve my favorite salad).   We really only come to Westgate to have meals. We wouldn't go near the place during gamedays or concerts, mainly because of crowds and parking.  But, we're aware of that, so we don't get all upset, like some other reviewers.  If we're going to an event at the arena or stadium, then we make sure to eat at the event or before we get there."}
{"text":"Lively activity center during the week between Christmas and New Years. Restaurants are all good, and service professional. Great for families"}
{"text":"I'll only will give you 3 stars because management is not doing everything in their power to remove Mcfaddens as one of their tenants. This horrible establishment is making the whole district look bad with their credit card frauds, trashy staff, horrible shady management and their 1.5 stars rating on yelp."}
{"text":"Westgate is a nice little area to hang around at, but as for Westgate Tattoo & Piercing Co. goes, i would NEVER recommend that place. yes, it was clean, but professionalism is definitelyy what it's about. As a professional, you should be honest with your client & not just be after their money. In my case, the piercer who did my industrial ear piercing should've known not to pierce my ear. Of course i didn't know, but apparently my ear isn't meant for that type of piercing due to the small amount of cartilage i have on the side of my ear.  Being a \"professional,\" he should've known this & not let money stand in the way. AND not only did he mess up my piercing, but my friend's as well.!!! (we went and got it on the same day) luckily my friend took hers out  about 2 weeks after getting hers. the piercer told her she should come back in 4-6 weeks, but everything \"should\" be fine. it started to cut her ear within the first week.!   I had mine in for a year & a week. But today was the day to get rid of it. It hurt about twice a week at night, and kept cutting my ear. (i loved the piercing so much, i push tissue in between the bar & my ear to prevent it from cutting me) Well, today i went in a different tattoo shop (halo precision piercing) & asked how common it was for the bar to cut your ear. She looked at the piercing & knew immediately my ear wasn't meant for the industrial & knew the guy was out for not only my money, but my friend's as well. It definitely makes me think twice about getting pierced at some tattoo & piercing shops. Honesty gets you further in life, rather than ignoring future possible problems you may face & have some money in your pocket.  & btw, if i hadn't gotten the piercing removed, it would've completely tore through the side of my ear, requiring surgery to get it fixed.!! It was only a matter of time.. & it would've been VERY soon, as the bar was already working its way out & was creating a bigger hole. safe to say, i will never trust westgate tattoo & piercing co. ever again.!"}
{"text":"If you are unfortunate enough to live in Glendale/Phoenix, you could try migrating here for something to do.  Westgate had potential but for some reason it continues to stay pretty shady at night.  I've worked here before and visited several times to check out the bars and there's no rhyme or reason to it, it's very hit-or-miss.  Saddle Ranch and Yard House always seem to be fun and busy.  The shops scattered around aren't anything to write home about and the fountain area is usually annoyingly loud with children trampling through the water bursts and then at night it usually switches to a teenager/date hangout.  If you are into the bar scene or staying at the Renaissance, it's fun to walk over and have some drinks/dinner but I definitely wouldn't go out of your way to make it to Westgate.  At night it's usually a fight waiting to happen and on UFC fight nights you'll want to avoid the area as it gets filled with \"tough guys\".  Lots of the stores that were once there have closed as well.  If you are a young professional or want a night out on the town, I'd definitely opt for downtown as it's a bit more upscale and professional."}
{"text":"Security.  There was a long black hair that curled around shoulder length, either Native or Hispanic.   A fight broke out, someone dropped their phone in which I retrieved. While asking which way they went this cowardly security officer snatched the phone out of my hand, told me that was theft. Here I am trying to return property to someone who lost it while the security officers try to use abuse their power. News flash, you work security, you are not law enforcement as much as you'd like to pretend!  I then tried to find another fake police officer to relive my issue. Of course long hair guy followed close behind me with the attempt of he said/she said and cancel out any explanation I had. By the time a real police officer was available my Uber had arrived and I could no long spend my time doing the \"honest thing\"  I don't respect security at Westgate anymore, nothing but a joke! I was not given the time of day to a person with any control. Expect security to take advantage of power and do as they want. Nothing but cowards behind a fake badge."}
{"text":"I had a great time here before BlackEyePea's concert with all the radio stands and bands/dj's performing, always a real lively atmosphere and before Superbowl was real fun too and before Kenny Chesney was fun also...I like how there is always stuff going on outside, events and promotional games, stands. Once a couple years ago on Christmas week they had snow, real snow and also about 10-15 christmas trees all decorated different, one was purple with all purple ornaments...they were all stunning."}
{"text":"I LOVE coming here to pick from all the restaurants!  And the movie theater is the best.  The vibrating seats make my day!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the past few years, and I have to say, its not half bad. Lots of shopping, food, a movie theater, and its close to the arenas that you can be in the center of everything for sports and concerts.  I will say, every time I come here it's never packed and I can't figure out why.  Parking is ample, and there's even a hotel on site as well!  This place is great to go to eitehr before or after a concert or a sporting event, as there's plenty to do. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Westgate has been growing it's seemingly chain-y brands boasting popular eats such as Chipotle & Buffalo Wild Wings. Gila Bend Arena and an AMC 20 are at each end amongst other spots that dot the glendale district.   Yard house, Hells Half Acre, and McFaddens go pretty hard in the paint (at times). I really like Kabuki but it's rather pricey.. There are some solid spots like Which Wich that keep bringing me back from time to time. The tanger outlets are adjacent with the Reconnaissance Inn right dead middle if you like to ball...in the West Valley..i guess?? Lol   It's not Old Town Scottsdale nor Mill Ave but it's comparable to or better than anything else West Valley. Too bad the light rail doesn't connect Mill Ave to Westgate. Maybe someday.... I'm a dreamer for sure.   Okay people, go forth and have fun!"}
{"text":"Are you not entertained? This is pretty much a playground for adults.   No way you can come here and not find something you like. Yeah, I get it, there are tons of chain restaurants...but come on, when have you been so picky that you can't eat wings...or Yard House...or Tex-Mex.   Actually, scratch that, don't get any of the Tex-Mex available here. In fact, don't eat ANYWHERE that doubles as a club late at night. But do drink in those places. Go barhopping because you can find any liquor, any beer, or any genre of music.   Most places here don't stick out to me. On their own, only 2-3 establishments break the four-star barrier. However, all the options transform into a giant gathering area greater than the sum of its parts.   Oh, and there's the sports teams and the movie theater. This rivals Bell Road for coolest place in the West Valley, and makes a good reprieve from other nightlife hotspots like Scottsdale and Roosevelt."}
{"text":"Love Westgate!  They have tons of eateries, the movies and a few shopping stores, but they have a free shuttle that takes you across to Tanger outlets where there rest of the shopping is."}
{"text":"This review is purely based on parking for an event at the arena.  The 1-2 times a year we make the hour drive from the East side of the valley out here for an event at the arena is always an utter chaotic nightmare on the way out.  We are very well aware of   parking lot fee and have cash ready.  But the  lack of organization and lot staff to direct at the end of an event is beyond insane. I wish there was a better solution so that events at Westgate are ended in a more positive note."}
{"text":"We come here quite a bit because I love the Yard House. When we noticed that they had character Wednesday we were really excited. However; summer is probably not the best time for this. Or they need to have a better system too keep kids cool as their splash pad is a joke for the number of kids. I will still come for the Yard House but no more summer events."}
{"text":"What a great location to pre-game! We flew in from Tampa Fl and pre-gamed at Salt. I grew up in Az and had never been to Westgate! There are a lot of things open during game days. I am unsure if anything is open otherwise. There is some shopping around there too."}
{"text":"What a bunch of whiny Southwesterners.  Westgate is a terrific accessory  built to take advantage of the arena and the stadium.  I am sure that the business generated by out of town visitors for games was the motivation, not the few rubles dropped by the pretentious locals who seem to like to complain about everything.  It is what it is supposed to be and serves the purpose well."}
{"text":"Interesting center with lots of shops and food places to choose from, but they aren't open that late.  Came here on a Saturday night and they had a few places that offered night life, but not many people.  The Margaritaville has a nice outdoor seating area and has a live band on Sat nights.  The Saddle Ranch has an interesting way to check your ID through a bouncer, black light and then you have to look up into a camera while they examine you... definitely the first I've ever seen of this.  The inside was interesting... they have a mechanical bull and interesting country music videos playing on their screens.   WCC has a cute water feature/fountain area."}
{"text":"So Westgate has turned off the Big Screens outside here in AZ which forces folks into the restaurants that are charging 100.00 to 1000.00 a person to sit down there.The one for a 1000.00 was advertised by the channel 12 reporter.Hopefully Westgate will struggle after today as the Reporter clearly stated that they were taking advantage"}
{"text":"Been here a billion times and this place is good to chill with friends.  Not too great when it's raining, or when it's melting hot, since this place is outdoorsy.    Great place to play Pokemon Go if you're into that stuff, plenty of stops and gyms, and a variety of Pokemons.    A lot of bars and places that serves alcoholic beverages if you into that sort of stuff.  A few great restaurants, and a AMC movie theatre.    This place has a bit of everything.  You can also ride the free shuttle that will take you to the Outlets for some serious shopping.  There's a splash pad for the kiddos, live bands will always play in the evening, a beautiful fountain that dances, occasionally big gatherings or events occurs like bike night or truck night, or whatever night.  Plenty of parking, unless there is a home game happening, then you're screwed.  And lastly the Loo's to do twos...all very clean.  They sure maintain the place well.    Overall an exciting place to go and hang out!"}
{"text":"For nightlife Westgate is about as good as it gets on this side of town - and that's just not good enough! It feels like a shopping mall of corporate bars. Seriously, if you are visiting from out of town and you want to have some adult fun - you MUST visit Old Town Scottsdale - the best bars, clubs, restaurants, art and live entertainment. Please don't judge our beloved valley by the west side!"}
{"text":"Love this place, when I lived in AZ I would come to this place all the time. Decided to go check it on in the summer when I was in town and it continues to be a great place to go shopping or eat great food with friends or family."}
{"text":"Fun during the winter as they have a mock ice skating rink. Great restaurants, movie theater, bars and even a Dave and Busters."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is massive.  We came to see a concert at the jobing.com arena.  Unfortunately the Cardinal game had ended maybe an hour previously so the two lane entrance we used was jammed and not for the impatient (me).  We had about an hour before the show yet not one restaurant we found had the ability to feed us if they were able to even seat us.  Apparently these places can't handle a rush.  Go figure.  The concert venue was okay, small enough that there aren't many bad seats.    We opted to eat after the show.  No choices outside of the usual cookie-cutter chains.  We made the mistake of eating at Margaritaville for the view of the water fountains.  They had a late-night happy hour with a selection of sliders nachos and such.   I'm going to keep it short and just say that it's not a good choice.  The staff was very friendly and helpful however."}
{"text":"Went ice skating between Christmas and New Year's. It was a pretty small skating rink, but it was a lot of fun! There was also comfy seating around a big Christmas tree and a live band playing oldies like Mustang Sally. It was a very enjoyable evening!"}
{"text":"WESTGATE! West Gate has been one of my favorite hangout spots for a long time, since high school! I remember going to the movies at AMC and going to Johnny Rockets for milkshakes all the time. As I got a little older, I started to venture out to the higher end restaurants and bars at West Gate. This proves that West Gate is a place for everyone.  I really like that there's a lot of outdoor seating and tables so you can spend some quality time outdoors. They have a splash pad for the kids too! A lot of times there's events and live music as well.  There's also a great variety of options for drinks and food. There are TONS of restaurants and bars to choose from. Some of my favorite places are: Whiskey Rose, a really fun country bar with great whiskey sours. Bar Louie because $5 dollar (delicious) burger Tuesdays, and Yard House because I can't get away from their Poke nachos. Kabuki also has great deals on cocktails and appetizers during their happy hour.  Some activities that I like to do at West Gate other than eating and drinking is to play arcade games at Dave and Buster's and it is also great ground to play Pokémon Go!  I would say the main reasons I come to Westgate are to catch a movie or to wine and dine. Although, there are other activities you can tend to like painting pottery or getting your nails done.  Make sure to come a little early as parking can be difficult on weekends. You will find a spot, as their parking lot is huge, it just might be bit of a ways out!"}
{"text":"Really not that great. It's an odd island of restaurants of average to subpar quality. The Greek place is pretty good, the sushi place is fine, but otherwise I haven't really found anything of note here. Nightlife is also weird, depending on what events they have going on really depends on the crowd. You don't really know if it's going to be a bunch of bikers or high school kids running around."}
{"text":"Watergate. Troopergate. Westgate.  Ugh! Seriously. It's like City Walk in Universal City, CA had an ugly step sister. Like City Walk is Marcia and Westgate is Jan. I mean really people. It's always Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. Well, she was prettier for God's sake. And here in Glendale, we have Jan.... Awkward Bad signage Pedestrian retailers Chain restaurants with UNINSPIRED employees Parking lots arranged by, oh, I don't know, Helen Keller  I thought this might be the reason to lure my snooty CenPho ass to the westside. But. No. Still the only reason to trek up the 101 is still mom and dad in Sun City. And the parking in their driveway is a breeze."}
{"text":"Date night. Girls night. Family night. Game night. Great restaurants, stores and a way to stroll the district. Super nice here. :)"}
{"text":"I really like how all the bars/restaraunts are all in one central area.  It also helps that the parking here is great.  It can be kind of dead at times, but if you come after a hockey or football game, this place is rocking.  All the places are only a few years old, and they have some great lights and fountain.  It reminds me a bit of a mini Las Vegas.  Yardhouse is one of my favorite places to eat.  Saddle Ranch and the piano bar place are the best nightlife spots."}
{"text":"It's a modern strip mall. Not very big, but with a few decent restaurants (by Valley standards, not for visitors). It feels like they tried to trend it towards professional 20-30somethings rather than families, but they fell flat.   Everything here is a chain. That's not an indictment of chains in general, but it creates an experience without any personality. It feels overdone.   On the plus side, there's really nothing else there. It's better than nothing."}
{"text":"This is a super shopping and entertainment center that's much like the \"riverwalk\" or \"city walk\" places that some cities are setting up as destinations. This place has everything you would need for a successful date night - ice cream shops, restaurants, multi-screen movie theater, shopping (large chains and small one-off's) and what would be complete without excellent beer options!  Parking is good and I noticed a strong security presence of rent-a-cops and actual cops. Perhaps that was because there was an NFL game the next day at the nearby University of Phoenix stadium, but I'm glad that they were there."}
{"text":"Located literally in front of the Gila River Arena is this entertainment district.  Its an area with lots of shops, restaurants, and even a movie theater.  Across from the parking lot is the Tangers outlet mall, hotels and just a 1/4 mile away is the football stadium where the Cardinals play.  We were staying next door at the Renaissance hotel, and came here on a Saturday night when the Ducks were playing the Coyotes.  Before the game, there's festivities for the kids.  After the game, the bars and restaurants were packed full of people, not just fans, eating dinner and enjoying a Saturday night.  They have pretty much any type of food to think of: - BBQ - Japanese - Cajun seafood  - Steaks - Burgers - to junk food, froyo, coffee, and dessert.  Plenty of parking and the places are open late.  Many merchants offer great happy hours during the weeknights."}
{"text":"Good lord, this place was lame on a Saturday. We went around 11:30 a.m. to eat lunch at Moe's Southwest Grill and Which Witch, and afterwards, we wanted to check out the shops. A little after noon, only a handful of shops were open and those were pretty much only the big name shops. Even shops that had signs indicated they should be open, weren't. I don't know anything about retail shopping centers but it seems that Westgate should regulate that. As a result of so many shops being closed, we were bored out of our minds. Our 4 year old probably enjoyed herself the most on the splash pad.   I have been here before for a concert and it gets happening at night around the restaurants. But retail shops, um not so much."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Glendale and want to hang out with my galpals and family, this is usually where we end up. And now with Pokémon GO out, this is a great place to farm some Poké balls!  Westgate has it all: bars, restaurants, small eateries, a Dave & Busters, a movie theater, a splashpad for your kids, and some boutiques. Right next door is a huge outdoor outlet mall for all you shopaholics. Parking at Westgate is plentiful and considering the Cardinals arena is here and so is a concert venue, this place can get ridiculously busy.  This is why it's called an Entertainment Disctrict.  All in all, it's a decent place to walk around when you have good company."}
{"text":"It was nice to hang outside by the fountain as the summer begins to reveal itself.  My daughter had a great time playing. Not as much seating but if come prepared you can make it work."}
{"text":"I went to this place in early October 2007.  Only a few stores and restaurants were open, otherwise everything else was still under construction.  The movie theater was really nice.  Not alot of people, big theater, clean.    We'll see how this place will be in a few years."}
{"text":"We usually come to this place on the weekends. But when my hubby is craving for some Japanese foods at Kabuki, we sometimes come twice or 3 times a week haha.  I love the happy vibes and very lively ambiance of this area. Obviously a lot of people loves it here, because this place is always packed. Other than the Phoenix Sports Stadium nearby, which seem to always have fun events going on. There's hotel also,if you come here as visitor and need a place to stay for the night. They have shopping  Centers too on the other side. I love to shop at the Outlet Mall here.  This Entertain Center has a lot to offer. Restaurants,Arcades, shopping places, Nail Salon & Spa, Ice cream and other sweet treats places etc.  If you come here for dinner, as most people do, there's plenty of restaurants to choose from, whatever your craving for the night . Hubby and I loves to dine at Kabuki, our favorite Japanese Restaurant here. Then afterwards we go watch movie at the AMC. There's a lot of fun places to go here, there's Dave & Busters, which is always crowded that both kids and adults love! You can also bowl at Tavern + Bowl, or if you just want to relax and sit, you can go to the park and just listen to the band that's playing on the park or just have a good chat as you cath up with friends and families.  I love this place a lot! It's quite far from where we live, but it's worth the 25 minutes drive ^_^"}
{"text":"It's a really cool place to go to for a bite to eat.  There are a variety of places to pick and eat at, from pizza to bar food. Not only that,  but there are places you can grab dessert from including Frozen yogurt, ice cream, and donuts. There are a few small stores around, but not that many. If you are looking for a place to eat it is worth stopping by."}
{"text":"This is a decent enough outdoor mall, with the outlets on one side and the entertainment on the other.  I give them good marks for events that they have such as ice skating and car shows, excluding the obvious hockey and football games.  There are issues with parking during events if you just want to go to the mall.  They want to charge you for parking if you're going to the game, so obviously those people will try to park in the free area... you can imagine how that goes.  Why charge for parking at all if you're going to have free parking right next to it?"}
