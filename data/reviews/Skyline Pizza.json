{"text":"Worst experience ever with a food service place. It looked like they put New cheese on old pizza and didn't even finish cooking it. When I called they told me to bring it back for a refund. My gas would've been half the bill so I threw it out and I can promise one thing. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN, PERIOD. Buyer beware, this place sucks.  P.S. The croutons on my wife's salad were burnt as well. = ("}
{"text":"This place used to be great. Then the good owner, who was obviously holding the place together, left. Reading the recent reviews, I can't imagine why. I ordered two slices (one cheese and one herbivore), bread sticks with garlic and cheese and a house salad. The slice of cheese looked like an old slice with fresh cheese tossed on top and then half way melted, the herbivore also looked like an old slice of cheese with veggies thrown on top and barely heated, the bread sticks had half melted cheese and were not cut and the salad had burnt croutons. Their idea of rectifying the situation is to have us drive the food back so they can remake it. Really? How about you serve fresh food, not reheated garbage? Never will we order from this dump again."}
{"text":"I went here because I saw that it was new and had a lot of good reviews on Facebook. The reviews MUST all be friends of the owner. It seemed as if everything was made from frozen. Pizza/wings/bread sticks. All sub-par."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza way out in Queen Creek/San Tan Valley!!!  If you're out this way at all, this place is well worth a visit... And for locals, this could be a weekly habit!  High quality ingredients making for darn good pizza :-)"}
{"text":"Pizza here was super greasy and business looks like a front. Cops were all over the place and an employee came to us telling us they were closed for the day. Really sketchy place to eat."}
{"text":"This business is closed. If they aren't, they need to answer their phone. We tried twice the last month to place an order for delivery. And no one answered the phone.  They definitely don't have their business in order."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time about a week ago. Picked up 2 pizzas to take home. Got them in the car and they smelled good - BUT - once I got them home and started eating, they were BRUTAL!  Quite possibly the most bland pizza I have ever had. Absolutely no sauce on them, very little sausage. Just terrible. I should had known better since #1- this place is out in the sticks and no one would go there, and #2- it was 5:30 at night and there was a total of \"ZERO\" cars in the parking lot. Didn't even see an employees car.   Never again- Pizza Hut and Papa Johns is better if you can believe that!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in a while. My family and I have eaten here quite a few times and we have not been disappointed! The staff is great and seem to always be in a good mood."}
{"text":"i am an ex employee from skyline pizza. Since this seems to be the only place the owner greg cannot delete bad reviews i'm going to leave this here.    Skyline pizza opened up on february 2nd of this year. I was hired the first day and the first employee. At first things were going great. then slowly it started to go downhill because of how unprofessional and greedy greg is. our paychecks were never on time and a lot of employees complained about their hours not being correct. me and I believe every employee that quit in the past couple weeks still have not been paid. despite promises from greg. he continually blames all of skyline's problems on the previous co owner billy who was there everyday from open to close. most of the loyal customers we had were because of billy and myself. and i am really sorry we can't give you the kind of service you deserve.   I have not tried the food since i've worked there over 3 weeks ago. but from reviews i've been reading it is not good anymore.   If you do not want to support a man that beat his wife, doesn't pay his employees, and has evaded taxes in the past with other pizza businesses then do not eat here. do not give him your money.   you can look up his past just by searching for papa keno's there are several court cases and other things.  Gregory Keenan is not a good man. he is the person that yells at employess to the point of them quitting or being in tears.   He's gotten rid of all of the reviews on facebook for a reason. because they tell the truth and he doesn't like that. which is exactly why he hates yelp and accuses them of being paid off."}
{"text":"Its a great place. Definetly go back for more....Very yummy. Love there pizzas salads the house dressing is my favorite. and sandwhiches at great price!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered two things and literally live behind the place and it took them 2 hours to deliver it. To top it off, they didn't offer any discount or anything for being so late. Save yourself the time and never goo here it's terrible service."}
{"text":"I really don't like leaving bad reviews, but after extensive personal experience with this place, I don't have a choice.  The pizza is mediocre at best, but cheap, so we went a few times. When Billy worked there, we'd stop in just because he - and the other employees - were friendly. Customer service always wins, so I try to frequent businesses when they have friendly employees.  However, the cops have been at this place constantly because the owner (Greg) keeps assaulting his wife. We literally got turned away because there was a parking lot full of sheriffs deputies. I don't know how this guy isn't in jail."}
{"text":"Ordered twice BOTH TIMES delivery took almost 1 1/2 to 2 hours and the second time they brought me some one else's pizza and not what I ordered. Pizza was not very good no better then a $5 hot and ready pizza from cheezers and cost 4 times the price!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and sandwiches.  Staff is polite.  I gave 4 stars because the location isn't in an ideal spot.  But they do deliver which is awesome.  Overall great spot and recommend the Chicken Parm sandwich!"}
