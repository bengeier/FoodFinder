{"text":"DELICIOUS PORK CHOPS!! 

Mind you, I've had my fair share of Asian pork chops, and Dong Yi Foods has just been crowned King of all Deep Fried Pork Chops in my mind. 

I've also tried the stall next door to them, I'm unsure to the name, but I remember they had big purple boards which prided themselves in $5 meals. 

I actually didn't try Dong Yi Foods at first, as I tried the place with the big purple billboards. Bought a basic fried beef slices in sauce with rice, and it really was just a $5 meal. My boyfriend on the other hand is the one who had ordered the pork chops ($6.50) from Dong Yi Foods, and man, I fell in love. He started raving just how wonderful they were, and of course, being skeptical (we usually get our fried pork chops at dragon center @ glen watford dr) and man, he wasn't kidding.

The pork chop was not only deep fried to perfection, but it oozed of flavour. I have no idea what kind of breading, or batter they use on the pork chops, but it's got this really weird but interesting kind of dry rub texture after you bite down on the pork chop. But this dry rub is what makes the pork chop a star, because you can tell that's where all the flavour is being held. 

It also comes with a generous portion of steamed white rice, a mini salad with peanuts mixed in, and a tea boiled egg. 

It was actually so good, that after I had finished my $5, I ended up buying a pork chop meal for myself to bring home. The lady at the counter had the biggest smile on her face, seeing as both my boyfriend and I truly did love their food.

A must try!"}
{"text":"Tried their Taiwanese Salty Fried Chicken, it's not bad, for $3.50 it comes in a nice sized box. (refer to pictures, the red box)
but doesn't have much of the unique flavor of the basil that they use for the Taiwanese Salty Fried Chicken. could add some spice, or some more basil leaf?

with so many competition in the same food court, they are one of the quietest (along with the one new comer), it's not a good sign."}

Taiwanese Food? Stinky Tofu? Deep Fried Pork Chops? Beef Noodle? All the food I love to eat.

No frills, self served kept the cost down. So basically I can stuff myself full at $6.50 tax in and with no tips required.... not that I am cheap... they don't even have a place at the counter for a tip.

Beef Noodle with Soup or Soya Milk Drink ($6.50 tax in) was really good. The cook that prepared my noodle has this concern looks on his face. \"Would she like my cooking? What she thinks about the broth? Are the Beef tender enough? How's the Noodles?\" Finally, he came right up and asked me........ Noodle cooked al dente with great bite, broth has great depth and beef tender..... 

Stinky Tofu ($3.50 tax in) was a huge disappointment. If you eat that like a deep fried tofu, it is A-OK... but it is not stinky at all!! Maybe they should just take that off the menu. I don't see how they going to deep fried stinky tofu in an enclosed food court without other businesses complaining!!

Now I think I need to try that Pork Chop next time! It looks good in the photo...... I told him I will be back!!!"}
