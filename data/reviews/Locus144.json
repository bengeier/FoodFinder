{"text":"Went by Locus with a few friends to check our their new menu. New menu items were fantastic. Shared the sausage stuffed olives, grilled calamari, beef carpaccio, arugula salad, and a couple of pizzas. Everything was super tasty and well done. The staff is also really great, friendly and knowledgeable. This was all perfectly matched with the game on the big screen and music in the background. New menu is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Cool joint in the heart of liberty village!   The food was amazing and it was a great vibe... I will be back!"}
{"text":"Visited Toronto from the US and loved this restaurant/lounge!  I enjoyed the ambience, food and the music!  Awesome vibes!  I will visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Talk about a friendly place. It always starts with the staff, and the staff at Locus 144 are great at what they do!  The layout of the place is just right, with open access to the bar. The perfect stop before and after a TFC game, Argos game, or a concert at the Molson amphitheatre, or just a quick pint after work.  The wings are on point all the time, and the porchetta with greens is a great choice as well. Delicious.  The drinks are priced more than fair, with some fine options on the top shelf for any occasion.  They always have The Game on, if it is.   Their sound system is wicked, and have lots of room to dance, when their DJ is putting in a shift.  I highly recommend going to the only non corporate bar in Liberty Village, Locus 144.  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I just celebrated by 30th birthday here and we had a great time. The place was pretty empty and food was still on the tables around 10:30 when we came in, but it slowly filled up and we ended up having an intense dance party for the rest of the night.  As for the music? One of my friends said it reminded her of a high school dance, And it's true -- there were throw back songs like Nelly and Sean Paul that took me back to high school days and the first few years of university. The DJ was happy to play a latin track I requested, and kept us dancing all night with soca, hip hop and more. All in all a great night. Love the fact that there is no cover -- a perfect venue when you have a big group and you want to give people the freedom to drop by when they can."}
{"text":"This is a review of it as a \"club\" not resto. Came here last night, Jan 19 2013  Decor is nice, but when it's a club scene, some of the beauty is lost, because of the crowd. It is incredibly small.  It is a no cover place, drinks are normally priced. A shot is about $7.00, average I believe.  The crowd, is..very..different. Eclectic mix of people. the dress code is all over the place. I saw a group of 3 girls wearing flannel shirts, then I saw a group of 3 guys wearing suits later in the evening. But this is what happens when it is a free for all, and I am not saying it is a bad thing.  The music is SICK!!..if you like hiphop and mash up house, etc. The dj was an Asian girl, she was pretty ill with it.   The only problem is, and I am of south Indian parents myself - it is only a matter of time before this place gets to be better known, and before the king st douches descend on it. I already saw a flyer for an Indian party to be held her (Indian promoters)sometime in Feb 2013..  I would come here again - if they were a  LITTLE more discerning about who they let in. But I mean, it's one of those \"all love\" spots..you get a lot of different characters. This is not a swanky stuck up place, and I am sure their aim is to make sure it never turns into one.  P.S - the owner Cassius is amazing! He made sure everything was taken care of, while I saw him WORK, while I saw him HOST and make sure everything ran smoothly.  Hard working guy to say the least, and all while looking fly in his V-neck!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute trendy spot! We only went here for the bar but the ambiance is great and they had really friendly bar tenders. Also so many gender neutral bathrooms with a full length mirror outside A++ if you're out on the town and need to check your appearance and actually make it to a stall. I love the look of this bar overall and would try it again for food."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night... Its a small place but great atmosphere and I have already recommended it to a bunch of my friends. The service was great too so I am kind of shocked to read the other reviews. The music was amazing too. Overall great place."}
{"text":"Made a 7:30 reservation via OT at 6:30 on a Saturday night and they honored it. Bartender set us up quickly with drinks and menus despite having a large birthday party going in the back.  We were seated quickly and they came by to take our order before aforementioned large party. Complimentary same day focaccia was great and held us over until the main event. Mushroom pappardelle for me, tri-seafood scampi for the husband. Both dishes were a win for us. We were far too full for any secondary courses, but our mains were great. Walking distance from our rental, dinner done in under an hour. Club music might be off putting for some, but it wasn't obnoxious at all. Return? Yes, I would."}
{"text":"The first time we sat out at Bar Vespa's patio, its hard not to notice the loud music, and herds of urbanites (mid 20-30s) making their way to Locus 144.  I recall just bumping my head to the beat of the music being played, so it was necessary to check this venue out the next time I made my way to Liberty Village.    Firstly, it doesn't have the crazy line up compared to Williams Landing and mainstream image.  Secondly think of this place as a hidden gem, pretentious free of all the BS!~, and away from the main street.  Thirdly.....its pretty hipster and you can tell its a place where people just want to have a good time and not give a crap about who's wearing what etc. etc.   For the area, Locus is a chilled out, casual environment where people can come together for some drinks.  They've got available, limited, table seating along the sides in the front and back.  In the middle along the side is a huge bar, which essentially is the focal point of this place.    The music is loud, but the when its good music, you can't complain ;) ..the dancefloor is very spacious so don't worry about brushing arms with some rando..... The drinks are well priced for the area, $16 for beer and mixed drink...and to top it off, the people seem friendly.    Though I didn't see any food being served, based on the previous reviews, I'll have to pay Locus 144 a second visit as I was quite impressed  ........ ............... ....................part 2 bar hop concluded..........next!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Friday night I was asking around where my group could go that's got a club vibe without the huge club, someone pointed us to Locus. From the street I heard them playing awesome dance music, and instantly I was excited to get inside. The crowd was mainly 20-35, most of the staff were great, a few were really slow with drinks. Bouncers were friendly, great mix of hip hop, rap, pop, reggae! It was a great atmosphere, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was dragged here on a Saturday night after a birthday dinner. I knew things were bad even as we approached the entrance. I could hear the music blaring from down the walkway, and when we walked in I felt like I was going deaf. The DJ they had was cranking his levels to obnoxious extremes, and with the sterile decor the sound was bouncing in all the wrong directions. It didn't help that the DJ was terrible to begin with.  The bartenders ranged from jock-like dudes and cleavage-heavy women. All of them seemed slow at their jobs and were too consumed pouring dozens of shots and making fancy drinks to get any of us a simple beer. We drank pints of Kronenbourg, which tasted really off and quite gross.  The washroom situation was one I wish I could have avoided: a bunch of drunk dudes waiting in line and hitting on any woman who happened to be waiting as well. I let a couple girls go ahead of me in order to avoid the onslaught of lame pick-up lines.  The crowd was a mixed bag. My girlfriend said the only people who go here are people who already live in Liberty Village, which makes sense seeing as I don't see why anyone who lives elsewhere in Toronto would specifically make there way here.  We stayed here for about 30 minutes. Terrible in every category."}
{"text":"Totally underrated place! They have a nice, large but quiet venue that was decorated quite nicely. The menu is large and has something for everyone, and all the food we ordered was reasonably priced and delicious. Service was speedy and friendly, with the waitress taking the time to ask where we were from and to give us recommendations based on that. Highly recommend, solid all around."}
{"text":"Love the beef brisket sandwich, it's had me coming back almost half a dozen times in the last month alone & I don't know how they cook the fries but they are amazingly well done...I need to start sampling the rest of the menu but I'm still to addicted to the brisket sandwich and fries & all for under $20 including a pop...that's a great dinner choice for anyone living on a budget like myself"}
