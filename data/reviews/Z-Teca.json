{"text":"I went to Z-Teca for the first time a few weeks ago after being really excited to try it out. Unfortunately, as with most over hyped oversold places, once I did try it, I was really disappointed.

Service was friendly but the flavour was lacking. It felt like I had gone to Chipotle, but so much worse. The rice and vegetables were boring, and rice was in copious amounts. Beans are optional/extra? What is up with that? It's a burrito!

I doused my burrito in hot sauce to give it some flavour, and vowed to find some where else to go next time I was hungry in Fairview Mall."}
{"text":"I agree that people are a bit harsh on this place.  It's a Canadian burrito joint after all, and a true Mexican Restaurant would probably not have whole wheat tortillas, brown rice, and lowfat sour cream.  On that note, I think Z-Teca is a good place to have a meal before sitting in class for 3 hours. I love their industrial chic seating area, great for getting last minute homework done.  Prices are great, especially as it seems to be the trend to overcharge for healthy food.

I have been pretty satisfied with the grilled shrimp burrito (light and delicate),  though I will admit their chicken is on the bland side. Their food has a very clean and healthy flavour with very little aftertaste.  

I've never been to Chipotle, which this place often gets compared to. However, I just got back from a week of taco binging in Mexico City and the fact that I am not complaining about Z-Teca is probably not a bad thing."}
{"text":"2 stars = Meh. I've experienced better. Fact is I've experienced WAY better. 

Z-teca gets 2 stars because the ingredients seem very fresh and for burritos they do press/grill them at the end (a technique sadly missed at many burrito joints).

Other than that the actual flavours are lacking all around. As my husband calls it, there's an overriding 'tang' that can't be ignored and sours the rest of the dish. I went for a chicken burrito bowl yesterday and although I left feeling light (these aren't the one pounders you get elsewhere), I still highly regretted my lunch decision. 

Go to Burrito Bandidos."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Burrito Boyz, but sometimes the line is just too long during lunch hour. Z-Teca seemed like an appealing alternative, so I gave it three chances to win me over. Suffice it to say, it failed.  

One thing I like about Z-Teca is the atmosphere. In comparison to Burrito Boyz, Z-Teca provides a fairly mellow, stress-free place to eat. The interior is clean and sleek. Typically the playlist is also all right. 

As for why Z-Teca couldn't win me over... 

1. Z-Teca is incredibly stingy with its burrito toppings. Not just with the meat, but also with its beans and veges. Unlike at Burrito Boyz or other competitors where the cost gets you your choice of toppings, Z-Teca charges you extra for just about everything, despite the above-average cost of the one-size-for-all burritos and salads. Even the onion/green peppers cost extra. Guacamole is $1.25 or so. One can easily pay $12 for their burrito if they want all the toppings - this is for a burrito that even with the works, is not as many ounces as a large $8-$10 burrito from Burrito Boyz. 
2. Another major setback is the customer service. Staff always appears angry and aloof. When I've politely asked for a premium topping, I get a curt reply that it'll cost extra, as though they don't want me to have it. Any request for an additional topping is made to seem like an inconvenience to the staff member. Aren't I paying extra anyway? 
3. Onions, onions, onions. It seems that everything is tinged with onions in order to compensate for the blandness of the meat and other toppings. 
4. Not once have I had my appetite fully quenched from one of Z-Teca's burritos. I've tried the chicken, the shrimp, and the vegetable burrito, none of which filled me up to satisfaction. Once I decided to order some chips so that I might feel more full, but was provided with only the tiniest container of salsa to dip them into. The container is so small that I had to break each chip in half to be able to dip it in. Naturally, an additional tiny container of salsa comes at a cost. The tiny container only provided enough salsa for about 4 chips - the chips are too plain to eat on their own, so I ultimately gave them to a homeless person. 

Z-Teca will likely be around for a while regardless of if it makes improvements simply on account of the convenient location. The establishment will forever live in the shadows of its competitors though in a neighborhood full of superior burrito stops."}
{"text":"The good: the burrito was prepared very quickly. The burrito was also fairly large, and well-stuffed. The bad: that stuffing was almost entirely white rice. The salsa was bland, the chicken was barely there, and, if there were other fillings available, nobody offered them to me.

Seven bucks for a wrap that's 95% filled with white rice? No, thanks!"}
{"text":"Z-teca carnitas burrito. Not so much flavour. I do not coming back. Great service but below average \" gourmet burritos\"

There is a lack of flavour. Even my son kidz meal was tasteless. Sorry but needs improvments"}
{"text":"I'm still stuffed as I write this, almost 3 hours after eating at z-teca!

Pros - decor, light, space, fast service (although we were there before the noon rush) and taste - v.yummy.

Cons - The burritos are HUGE - 'the size of an NFL football', as my colleague put it!  I guess being a relatively small girl, I shouldn't have eaten the entire burrito, but I did and now I am stuffed and craving a siesta!  Didn't like having to pay extra for guac.

So my advice - go early to avoid the rush and order appropriately for your size - the bowls looked like they were a more decent size.  Don't bother saving half your burrito 'for later' - I don't think it would taste so good several hours later!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Clean, fast, super yummy and not as expensive as Chipotle. Will definitely come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Yea, not sure why this place got bad reviews. Food was really good. I like that the menu is not daunting. 10% off if you're a student is a bonus."}
{"text":"I've been to other z teca joints. this place is dead, and they refused to give the option of \"half corn, half veggie\" without charging me. 

not impressed."}
{"text":"They have recently under gone new management, and its definately noticable. They are definatly skimp on the toppings..they barely put any salsa, cheese or sour cream in. I asked for no rice and was given a huge mound of lettuce in lieu...I ordered the shrimp burrito and it felt like I was eating a vegetarian burrito. I won't be returning...My friend asked if I got the lettuce burrito. Enough said. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Dropped in with my boyfriend.  I should have realized that something was off, if at 7:30pm, there was only one other couple eating on the patio.  I took a look over the counter, and it looked clean, and the toppings looked fresh enough, so decided that we will give it a shot.  The menu seemed similar to Chipotle, so we figured that the food would be similar.  I never knew you could make a mistake with burritos, but apparently it's possible...

We ordered two veggie bowls.  (Just an fyi for vegetarians out there, there are no soy products here, but you do get guac, beans, and sauteed veggies instead.)   As we were ordering, we had to ask for a bit more of practically everything (except for rice, of which there was plenty).  The person who took our order skipped over the guac, and proceeded to ask which salsa we want.  He was ready to ring up our bill, and I had to ask for guac for both orders (it should have been a given, since it comes with the vegetarian dish according to the menu). He was pleasant enough, but it seemed like it came out of his own pocket to give us a proper amount of anything.  

The service is one issue, but the taste is another.  The food is bland.  The sauteed veggies did not taste fresh.  Some of the grains of rice were hard.  

Also, I think they charged for the 'extra' we requested.  How did our $8.50 (x2) bowls, plus $1.50 soda come up to $22 and change?  No clue...  Don't get me wrong, I don't harp over change, but for bad service and overpriced food, no way.

First and last time... Sorry..."}
{"text":"Overpriced and flavorless. Too much corn and super sodium drenches the veggies and beans. Ate there once last year when it first opened for a \"healthier alternative\" to the crap on campus and I might as well have eaten McDonalds, and I have never even eaten at McDonald's."}
{"text":"The blandest burrito of my life. Just awful."}
{"text":"I'm confused as to why the reviews for this place are so terrible. We ordered in for my workplace and every single one of my coworkers absolutely loved their meals!

The food was fresh, the seasonings were just right and the balance of veggies to rice to meat was perfect. The bonus was for what we paid for each burrito/burrito bowl everyone was more than satisfied with the amount of food they received.

Will definitely return here again as our first experience was so fantastic!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews for this place are so bad, if you are looking for inexpensive albeit westernized Mexican food and atmosphere, this is a great place with student discount to boot"}
{"text":"Sadly, I do not know of good places to get burritos when I'm in the GTA so I rely on z-teca to get my fix. I've been here many times and i find you are very limited in what you want to put in your burrito. Like for veggies you can only choose one item out of the three offered (corn, beans, or bell peppers). I guess the good thing is that there are many promotions (all burritos on cinco de mayo were $5)

Overall, it's nothing really special.... can someone please open a yummy burrito joint uptown? lol please and thanks"}
{"text":"Z-Teca isn't amazing, but it's definitely as not terrible as these reviews make it sound.  (Although, I've never found the muck served at Burrito Boyz to be that enjoyable).  I had a vegetarian burrito on whole wheat. As far as vegetarian burritos go, it's probably one of the best I've had. They use black beans and roasted corn or roasted fajita vegetables. I asked for just a little bit of rice, guacamole, lettuce and salsa (Mango and Mild). It was quite refreshing and flavourful. They also have vegetarian quesadillas, salads or bowls.  I recommend mixing the salsas for extra flavour. The inside of the restaurant is also quite nice. There are a lot of big tables and booths, nice art work, big windows overlooking Gerard/Ryerson. 
 
Ryerson students get 10% off."}
{"text":"Everything's really onion-y: the salsa, the vegetable filling, the guacamole.  Fortunately, I went with coworkers and we all ordered the same thing, because otherwise I would have been afraid to open my mouth at all for the rest of the afternoon."}
{"text":"Z-Teca is my go to place for a burrito when I'm in the Ryerson University area. This is my go-to place for a good meal after a workout.

I ordered a Grilled Steak Burrito with whole wheat tortilla, black beans, rice, cheese, sour cream, mango salsa and guacamole (additional cost). The burrito is tasty but I have had better (Big Fat Burrito). If you want a burrito that doesn't cost too much, this is the place to go. 

This location offers 10% off to students if you show your Ryerson or school I.D."}
{"text":"The only Mexican restaurant at York University so they just have an \"screw you, pay me!\" attitude. After so many bad experiences I just refuse to go to this place. I love Burrito Boyz, Burrito Banditos, and Chipotle, etc., but I will never ever ever go to Z-teca.  The staff are either surly or just don't care.  The thing that drives me into a blind rage is that they ask you what toppings you would like but they only let you choose a preset number, so if you want corn, and salsa and peppers, NO SORRY YOU CAN ONLY HAVE TWO. One time I asked for no cheese, but then I wanted 3 veggies, they said no sorry you only get two. I'm like WTF I said no cheese and cheese costs you way more than some god damn 5 cents worth of corn.   I literally had to ask to speak to the manager before they would give me the forbidden kernels of their precious corn.  Go f yourselves you cheap mofos. NO other Mexican restaurant does this. If you go to chipotle and ask them for everything they will give you everything (except guac which is extra) If you ask chipoltle for extra beans or corn or veggies they will do pile that bad boy till it's sky high.  I can understand if its quac or cheese or meat and you want extra, yes you have to pay more, but I'm talking about CORN.   Corngate 2017 - NEVER FORGET!"}
{"text":"Coworkers and I had lunch at the Exchange Tower. Been here before. I usually order a grilled steak salad bowl but this time I ordered the pork carnitas burrito with some nachos, salsa and pico on the side. The pork was well seasoned and very flavorful. Lots of toppings to choose from. The nachos are fried on site, pico was fresh and spicy. Lots of fresh ingredients. Try it! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Saturday night for take out. Burrito was AMAZING. Cool Layout and decor"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. For the location that's it's in, it works for me. I will admit calling it Gourmet Burritos is a but much. By all means they were really good, but I wouldn't say gourmet. 

I went here at midnight because my friend and I just didn't want the typical deep fried, cheese covered whatever that you normally get after spending a night out. We both got the $10 special which got us a burrito, drink and chips (that they make themselves). I thought the price was good for all that. I didn't even finish everything. The burrito was huge. 

I would definitely go back here and would recommend it to anyone who wants something different from pub/ fast food. 

It's too bad not more people like it."}
{"text":"Still love the salads... Have been coming here regularly for the steak salad bowl which is delicious.  You can add two salsas and I recommend the hot one although it's not that hot.  I only wish this place had a selection of hot sauces like chipotle does."}
{"text":"In a nutshell? 

Uninspired
Boring
Overpriced.

I'm a loyal burrito boyz fan and I decided to try Z Teca at a friends recommendation and I completely regretted it. 

Toppings are limited, selection is boring and standard. What exactly makes this place gourmet?

You would be better to make your own at home. 

Don't let the line ups fool you."}
{"text":"Went with office team and I had the burrito.  It was sizable. Not huge fan of Tex Mex food but they served Corona. So that is a plus in my book."}
{"text":"this was so disappointing especially the veggie burrito bowl. It was so below average. Mostly rice, bad black beans, a sprinkle of  cheese, a small dollop of sour cream and guacamole and the veggies were mostly red onions. 

They really really need to take notes from Fresh West grill - they really do a veggie bowl right!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you something, this is the WORST place you could ever possibly go to. The food isn't the worst, it's so mediocre you could make it at home but thats not why I hate this place. They are the greediest place in the entirety of York University. They always charged extra for guac which is fine, but these cheap bastards have started charging for chipotle sauce! So basically you are left with a few strands of grilled green pepers and onion, 1 scoop of meat (think ice cream scoop), corn or beans (1 scoop) and a tomato like paste they call salsa. Everything else is extra, I thought i'd be paying $9 bucks, I went to counter and they charged me $12 for extra rice (hardly) and chipotle sauce. You know the stuff that you're SUPPOSED to have in a good burrito bowl. Lets not even compare Chipotle to Zteca, Chipotle's taste and portions are much much better. Zteca looks like they give a lot but they don't, it's mostly filled with shredded lettuce."}
{"text":"I don't usually buy my lunch on a workday but today felt like treating myself to a burrito. Z teca is a burrito place in restaurant row on King by Peter St, and close to my office, so I decided to give them a try.

I was there at 11 and likely was their first customer of the day. The girl who served me from behind the counter could not have been more disinterested and spoke so soft that every time she asked me for a selection, I had to have her repeat the question.

As for choices on what to have on my burrito there were few. I had rice and beans, the rice was plain white. I was not offered onions or tomato, (I would have said no to the tomato anyways but should have been asked), I was asked about sour cream and said no and had the medium sauce on it. 

They heat the tortilla first, place on the ingredients, roll it and give it a 10 second press in a sandwich machine.

The size of the burrito is excellent and the $8.76 is a good price for that size burrito. The rest not so good. It was a very plain, and bland . The medium sauce was just OK but was the only thing that added flavour. The chicken, beans and rice were all extremely plain.  

If you are there and want a burrito, head around the corner to Burrito Boyz. Z teca is not worth the visit."}
{"text":"didn't like my chicken burrito one bit - chicken pieces were blackened to the point it was not eatable and in general no flavour at all. very dissappointed"}
{"text":"We agree with Mikiya, as woohoo our veggie burritos with black beans and corn were just so good with mango and mild salsa, and there is nothing bad to say about the place. 

Our meals were so fresh that it almost hurt. Really. In a good way :)  We didn't think that we were so hungry when we were eating our heavenly meals. We washed burritos down with Nestea, which made it even yummier. I added to my mild one some hot sauce and I was able to handle it and get some original tex-mex experience. 

We love it and will go back to another time to try more of these and try the veggie tray also."}
{"text":"Not the best.
Beans seemed to be straight out a can. 
Portions for the burrito bowl was so small it couldn't make me (a 100lb 5'4 woman) full. Plus it was approximately 9 dollars. Chipotle is more worth it. Burrito Boyz is still the best, obviously."}
{"text":"I'm gonna hop on the 3-star train and give this z-teca a solid, yes, three stars.

Decor is clean and comfortable, as one might only expect from a chain restaurant. Service is quick and friendly (the burrito guy is particularly eager to chat while expertly rolling up my order). Prices are... enh...average I suppose, though I couldn't help thinking to myself, \"Sheesh. Who pays this much for burritos, anyway?\"

I went for the chicken fajita burrito, \"fajita\" for the veggies instead of beans. Flavour was good, and they honoured my request for salsa in it which they typically don't do. I ate in and was handed a tin tray with napkins and my compact lunch, grabbing one of the provided Metro papers on my way to the window table. 

Flavours are mellow. Perhaps mellower than I might expect, but altogether pleasant. Nothing crazy and kickin' per say, but the addition of medium-hot sauce was good. I would like to see more chicken in there, but isn't that always the case? Hearty, filling, but not overly so. The burrito boy even brought over a complimentary bag of tortilla chips for my enjoyment (nice!), but that was probably only because I was a single, smiley girl. Whatever. The tortilla chips were light, savoury, and crispy - and 6 hours later, still are. Comforting.

Good option for lunch on the go in this area."}
{"text":"Alright I guess. Better choices only like 10 minute walk away.
Had every burrito on their menu at this point in time, excluding breakfast burritos.

Tortilla: Good
Rice: Hard
Tomatos: Fresh
Salsa: Medium more like mild, Hot more like medium
Meats: Cod is best, followed by shrimp and chicken. The rest are meh and messy.

Chips: Good enough."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came to Z Teca this evening to curb our taco and nacho cravings. Aesthetics of the restaurant were great but unfortunately it was all down hill from there. We ordered 3 tacos - which we were double charged for. And an order of chicken nachos with a side of guac- which upon opening at home included no chicken and no side of guac. Luckily we caught the double charge for the tacos and the manager was happy to refund us our money.  As far as flavour goes, we found both dishes to be mediocre at best and the presentation was sloppy. Definitely more to be desired at an establishment that labels itself a gourmet burrito restaurant. 

Overall not a horrific experience but Z Teca definitely gets a \"Needs Improvement\" from us."}
{"text":"Since I live in Markham, there are not many Mexican or burrito joints, so when I saw Z-teca after hitting Fairview Mall one day, I was excited to try it. Their concept is huge burritos filled with a variety of toppings which range from chicken, beef, onions, cheese, corn and so on. Granted the size of the burrito is huge, but the price is huge as well, at least its a huge burrito instead of those dinky ones you get at Taco Bell but you pay 4 times more.

The burrito itself is pretty tasty but they add in a lot of rice, I guess to fill it to that impressive size that makes you think you are getting your money's worth. What I didn't like about Z-teca was that if you want extra toppings, they overcharge each topping so that a burrito could literally be 15 bucks, I mean like seriously....I get that you if want extra stuff you gotta pay but some stuff is meant to go in a burrito, and that's where they make that extra dollar or two.

Summing it up, the burrito is good but it's not something that you would die without, like a moist chocolate chip cookie..."}
{"text":"good service, fresh ingredients, they all seem nice. Interior is nice and clean. Great spot to pick up a quick lunch"}
{"text":"I always get the Chicken Burrito Bowl. It's not the best I've ever had but not bad if you're looking for something healthy and low carbs at York! It's around $10 but low on proportion compared to Burrito Boyz half size naked bowl. Also agreeing with other comments, just lack flavour. Especially the rice and chicken but the toppings and salsa somewhat help balance the taste. 
I usually find seats here so just get food from here too.

Tip- ask for more sauce/salsa because you'll end up with dry rice"}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES
I wish one could assign 1/2 stars as this is a solid 3.5 star venue. It's certainly a big burrito, maybe not as long as Burrito Boyz but much thicker. Despite this, it's a surprizingly easy to eat burrito due to the perfect grilling of said burrito. 

Much like Mucho Burrito, you have your choice of burrito (burrito with beans, burrito with grilled veggies, burrito bowl) and choice of filling (steak, chicken, beef barbacoa or veggie). It's not a fantastic burrito but it's certainly very good and quite large. The toppings looked a little old but somehow tasted quite fresh. $1 extra for guac. Bullshit.

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
Beef Barbacoa - \"Mexican beef\" is kind of a scary term but this is actually quite good. Like pulled beef or something. Just ignore how weird it looks to have your beef scooped into your burrito with a fucking ice cream scooper. 

LOCATION NOTES
South side of King, just West of John. Way too clean and bright to really feel like a burrito place. 

SERVICE NOTES
It's a pretty fast burrito but I wouldn't be surprized if it takes forever at lunch. Open until 10pm every night.

{"text":"Very stingy with the meat!!! Rice overcooked. Located on the outside of the mall's south side. It has a nice patio at least"}
{"text":"** 3.5 stars **

What do you do when you have a major burrito craving, Quesada is closed and Burrito Bandidos is too far to walk?

This evening, I ended up at z-teca, the \"gourmet burrito\" joint, and ordered a grilled chicken burrito to go. 

The rice was okay, except for the few dry grains I chomped on. Cheese and beans were decent, and the lettuce bits were nice and leafy. The medium salsa DID have more kick than Quesada's. But - as other Yelpers pointed out - I noticed the onion-y aftertaste well after I'd finished eating.

\"Dos\" quibbles:

(1) It only comes in one size. If I wasn't that hungry, half of it might have ended up in the trash. At least Quesada and Bandidos offer \"small\" and \"big-ass\"/\"large\". 

(2) Yes, the burrito IS under $10. But here comes my \"cheapskate\" analysis. All in, my z-teca burrito cost $8.76. Correct me if I'm wrong, but a small Quesada burrito comes in under $8, and the (small) Bandidos burrito is priced somewhere in the middle, depending on your order.  

While the burrito filled the hole in my stomach, it didn't make me a convert. Thanks for playin', z-teca."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. I always order the tacos with chips combo. I have an obsession with mangos so i love that they have a mango salsa. The spicy salsa is a must if you can handle it!"}
{"text":"A year and a half later- I return! 

....But I'm horribly disappointed. I was lured back to z-teca when a friend told me about a deal: $30 for two burritos, two cans of pop and two movie tickets. Sounds amazing! Until you actually go through with it. 

First off, I've never had a burrito take that long. For my friend ahead in line, she had the unfortunate sight of an assembler literally scraping the bottom of the container for the last of the barbacoa. No one wants to see that! You're supposed to keep up the illusion that everything is fresh. When it gets low, fill it up before someone gets the last scrappy bits knowingly. I thought everywhere knew that unwritten rule? Same went for the beans and fajita vegetables. I guess the turnover isn't fast enough. 

Ah so much about getting food is the experience! And when it was my turn to order and get the barbacoa, I was excited. I thought, yay, I'll get the fresh stuff! And then I saw them take it out of plastic bag they just warmed up in the microwave... Augh, really? You're letting me see that? I get that this happens, but you're not supposed to flaunt it. 

Then, I ate it. At first bite, not so bad. But as I made my way through it, everything dawned on me. The rice was mealy. The veggies were undercooked. The barbacoa was too salty and spiced in away that was too aggressive. The mild salsa had a 50:50 , tomato to red onion ratio to the point that red onion was all I could taste. Normally, I finish my burritos and this time, it just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Z-teca has branded themselves as a gourmet burrito place. But nothing about this place is very gourmet. They offer standard burrito toppings, grilled/slow-cooked meats, and the typical brown / white rice base. I went at lunch time on a weekday, so there was a line up. However, there isn't anything special about this place. I ordered the grilled chicken burrito bowl. The ingredients used to build the bowl weren't very fresh. You can tell the veggies used are at least a day old. The portion size was decent. However, for $10/bowl, it isn't something to rave about. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Situated inside a food court of an office building, this place has definitely lost a potential customer.

Ratings would have been higher months ago but ownership has changed and boy do you notice a difference. This location is back to levelling their portions to unrealistic quantities especially for someone like myself who orders vegetarian and only selects a handful of toppings (don't eat corn, cheese, sour cream, limiting my meat intake).

I always order the salad bowl and used to justify the near $10 costs for fresh healthy ingredients but no more! 

Hello Burrito Boys up the street!

In my salad bowl, toppings consist of black beans, sautéed green peppers, guacamole, medium and mild salsa the odd time ask for a small scoop of rice to crave those hunger pains that lettuce alone cannot cure! I also do not get the dressing.

As I don't top my meal with every ingredient available, I asked for extra black beans and was greeted with the stare of death. I realize that management place these rules but was seriously put off by begging for a few more beans. I could literally count how many beans were portioned into my bowl! 

My co-workers have noticed the same difference in management and are put off by the service provided. The owner even pointed out they have favourite customers which received special treatment- not a way to conduct business.

With Burrito Boys in the neighbourhood I will definitely be buying lunch there due to greater variety in toppings and serving size without having ask for more."}
{"text":"Good consistent quality of food. Staff is always smiling and friendly. They could do though with increasing regular store hours (theyre in a hot area!). Its a little bit pricier than other places but hey this is downtown toronto and you do get what you pay for (quality). I prefer this place to chipotles. 

Con: they need a better music playlist and/or sound system lol"}
{"text":"Stale and rehashed flavors, went in reluctantly once and will probably never go again! (Unless morbidly curious...)

Our somewhat stunted little province is rife with these mysteriously expensive food chains that serve this flavorless & nutriionally-bereft quasi-food garbage. Service was helpful to my inquiries; I ordered a chicken burrito, and the toppings actually looked fresh made if the tortilla didn't (it was on the verge of cracking). Way too much in a hurry to assemble and not properly heat through, though there was little solid food in it to heat I guess. The smattering of chicken tasted re-heated and salty, the sauce toppings weren't bad but the fresh veggies & particularly the onions tasted stale, stale, stale. The 'cheese' was barely present in flavor and may as well have been (or was it actually?) colorful wax shavings sprinkled on the somewhat miserly contents that altogether did not really satisfy.

I did get through said pathetic 7-dollar burrito, and though that was a rip off there was at least a sale this week (um, the deal gets worse?). But if this is what 'gourmet' fast food has become, I'm opting out. What a ripoff. Seems like the place was designed by yield managers whose sole and soul-less aim was to empty your wallet cynically & efficiently allowing the least imaginable enjoyment or health benefit possible.

Q: Is it THAT hard to make decent cheap TexMex takeout east of the DVP? Burrito Boys on Peter Street kicks this place in the keister. People are not stupid, you know and the Beach has its share of doubters when it comes to eating out down the block. What a stupid, cynical farce of a resto chain this is, there's no way Z-teca will last here or ever make money. Certainly what they do take in money-wise doesn't show in quality.

Here's a sharp business idea: when it comes to food you have to give an actual shit and not serve virtual shit. Even with the Ontarians. Time will prove this hypothesis correct!"}
{"text":"My second burrito chain of the week, Z-Teca on my burrito bonanza tour!  Z-teca is very similar to other burrito chains; they offer the standard fare - burritos, bowls, salads, quesadillas & tacos.

Only one size for their burritos, when I got mine it was an average size.  They only offer two tacos on their menu - a bit of set back considering three is the average at other chains.

My chicken burrito was descent but no major highlights.  I liked their salsa options.

Z-teca offers a cheap meal options on the trendy King West theatre strip; check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food was OK.  Lacked real flavour.   Portions were also OK.   They need to step up to the likes of Burrito Boys and Chipotle."}

{"text":"Fresh, delicious Mexican food. Will be coming here more now that I know the. Support their community."}
{"text":"The most garbage food. Half of the chicken I got was rubbery - nasty.

Plus they scrimp on all of the toppings. I'm paying $11 for a bowl AND $1 for guacamole."}
{"text":"I agree with the sentiments of the other reviews. The food definitely tastes fresh but for the price I'm paying for I definitely expected more. Are you really going nickle and dime me for wanting more lettuce? Yeah I definitely won't come back other chains such as burrito boyz and chipotle have bigger servings and the same quality."}
{"text":"I finally can complete my Yelp list with this review of Z-teca burritos. We were able to order in a group for delivery at work. Yeah!  So, I can't say anything about what the store looks like, and maybe the transit time decreases the quality, but it needs to be able to stand up to a 10-15 minute walk down the street, right? 
Anyway, I ordered the vegetarian, which is a unique combo of Guacamole and grilled corn. The grill/char on the corn lends a suble, but tasty flavour. The Guac is creamy and thin- whereas I prefer a spicier chunky version. Seems like it might have come out of a caulking gun a-la Taco Bell. I asked for HOT salsa, which is supposedly made with chipotle peppers- which are not a hot pepper to begin with. So, the results were that there was flavour, but no spice throughout a very rice-y burrito. By no means my fave. I would suggest if you are near this location, keep walking west on Dundas to Mission Burrito for a little more magic."}
{"text":"Holy burrito! Absolute monsters but I'll make the sacrifice. A little pricey, twenty something dollars for two, but we like EXTRAS. Load up the shrimp baby. You'll be full after this bomb full of yumminess."}
{"text":"Meh. In a pinch it's fine, but there are way better burrito places within walking distance. Very heavy on the rice. Pretty bland."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Chipotle, then think of that with a couple more zesty options. The styles of the food menu and physical store layout are rather similar. We went during the late afternoon on a Thursday, and there was no line. Drink options were limited as there were no fountain drink options, just bottled drinks. This particular store was very clean, and I enjoyed the eco-friendly design. I had more food than I could eat in one sitting, and the gentleman behind the counter was very kind in wrapping up my food for me. I heated up my burrito bowl more than a day later, and it was just as good when I first bought it."}
{"text":"I'll readily admit that I am not a crazy burrito fan.   I dunno what most people look for in their burritos, but I liked the experience I had at the new Z-teca on King St.  

Confession: I don't like heat and spice (they're not flavours - they're sensations!! and i often find a lot of of places use heat rather than paying attention to flavours).  And I try to stay clear of beans (for obvious reasons, i hope).

Given my confessions, I really liked that Z-teca offers a Fajita Burrito which is like a regular burrito but with sauteed veggies instead of beans.  I had the grilled shrimp with regular tomato salsa and guac.  YUM!!  It was quite good... altho, I still think the Burrito Boyz fish burrito is still king.

Dining companion had the grilled chicken tacos.  They come in pairs with a side of crispy fresh tortilla chips.  

The one thing they have totally over Burrito Boyz is that the staff at Z-teca were super nice... one thing BB staff is not particularly known for...  

Cool space.  This is what fast food should be."}
{"text":"Same as the usual burrito place, nothing really stood out to me.  We got the grilled chicken burrito as well as the pulled pork burrito.  You can only have either rice or lettuce and no guacamole.  

The place itself is well lit up and looks very clean/modern.  But I prefer my Burrito boyz instead.  Not to mention the burrito is more expensive and a little smaller than Burrito Boyz.  $8.25 vs the $6 from Burrito Boyz."}
{"text":"When this place first opened I would have given it probably a 1-star rating.  They were so stingy with all their toppings (especially meat, where they'd level off the scoop to make sure you don't get \"too much\").  That seems to have gone away and the helpings are slightly more generous.  
The main plus to this place is they pride themselves on natural ingredients and I believe it.  The meat and veggies all taste fresh and natural (no sodium overload like Chipotle).  Also for the area they're probably the best bet if you have a burrito craving (way superior to BarBurrito).
The main downside is price.  The meat portions are still pretty small and you get charged extra for everything: veggies, corn, guac.   It's a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"Definitely a fair go to location for a packed and filling burrito. I went there on a Wednesday afternoon around 6pm. It was relatively empty, I had ordered nachos for app and my friends and I had ordered a burrito and two burrito bowls. 

I would say: don't order the nachos. It's not that many, it comes in the container of a burrito bowl. There are only so many chips, the cheese is only layered on the top and not spread out evenly and when I got the nachos, they weren't fully melted. There was one area that was a chunk of cheese, the rest was relatively dry. I would give the nachos a 1.5-2/5. However, I had the steak burrito and it was packed. And actually very well balanced. I had been doubtful since people seemed like there wasn't a lot of meat in them and a lot of rice. However, when I ordered it, it was well balanced, a scoop of rest, a scoop of everything else. By the end, as I was eating it, at no point did I feel like it was lopsided, and I was beyond full by the time I was done.

My friends both enjoyed their burrito bowls and said that they would return for the burrito bowl again because it's so filling and delicious.

Good quick go-to, we left around 7/730 and by the time we left, three or four more tables were seated but it was never super busy at any point."}
{"text":"There's nothing gourmet about this \"gourmet burrito\" place. I ordered a burrito bowl with pork, cheese and spicy salsa. The \"bowl\" is a tin plate with a sad dollop of rice and a scoop of pork, plus a spoonful of salsa, sour cream and beans, wilted lettuce and a handful of rubbery cheese that was barely even melted after a few seconds in the microwave. 

Grilled vegetables? Optional. Guacamole? Optional. Even if I had added these things I feel like they would have just made more of a gloppy mess with the bland rice. At least the pork tasted pretty good.

The service is very quick, which was a plus, but I could hardly hear what either of the people at the counter were trying to ask about my order. It's also a generous portion and not too expensive. I wish I'd read a couple of tips beforehand and tried the nearby Burrito Boyz instead."}
{"text":"Pricey and stingy on their portions. Its really sad that you have to ask for more meat on your burrito because they give you TWO pieces of whatever you choose (chicken/steak/etc).

I dont know how they are still in business"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there today. We both are fans of mexican foods. The buritos we had there was the worst we have had so far. The personel were too cheap. He did not even add guacamole on our buritos at first and when we asked for it, he added it reluctantly."}
{"text":"Had a  chicken bowl to go. Was not impressed with quantity of ... Anything really very stingy with the scoops. Asked for more corn and was told 75 cent charge ! For freakin corn !!! It's the cheapest thing ever ... 
 
Don't waste your time here chipotle is Leagues beyond this place for the same price they give you all the toppings you choose."}
{"text":"Toronto has a lot of burrito joints and most of them make you pay with your time and money. Not Zteca though; they only need your cash. And with good reason--their steak is overcooked and the burrito is very bland. If you don't have time to wait in line at Burrito Boyz, then get something else."}
{"text":"I live in the area and got a coupon so I decided to try it out. I went with my kids who love Mexican.  The decor was industrial, a little cold, but definitely contemporary. 

What immediately caught my attention when I walked in was how clean the restaurant looked. I may have gotten there at a good time, but after dealing with their staff, i knew they must be on the ball here.

I ordered a chicken burrito, steak quesadilla and 2 tacos. With 2 soft drinks and a coupon, the total still came out to $27. I should have read the reviews because my chicken burrito was full of rice. I could barely taste or see the chicken (see my photos).  There were very few topping choices that weren't a la carte. Same could be said for the other items I ordered. 

The staff was fantastic, and which is why I rated it a 2. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon mainly because the price didn't match the taste."}
{"text":"People in the Zteca line, please get a life. How badly do you actually need a burrito? Why do you put up with such crappy food, high prices and disdainful service? And why, why are there so many of you?! 

I don't get why people throng around this place, eager to pay $8 for starch wrapped in starch, flavoured with some sad looking meats. Oh you want sour cream. That's extra. You want guacamole - super extra. And heaven forbid that you haven't got answers to the questions they are mumbling at you. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Meh is just about right. 

I went here with a couple of friends and they said they would've much rather gone to a Chipotle than this joint. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. 

I got the 2 taco combo. I chose the chicken tacos. They were pretty conservative with the amount of meat they used, but pretty generous with the amount of lettuce and salsa they used. They used romaine leaves for the lettuce and I'm a big fan of eating healthy and all, but sometimes the romaine just isn't right for a taco. My combo also came with a bag of nacho chips and salsa.

For the amount I paid and the amount of food I got, I was kinda of disappointed. Not only that, but the flavors just weren't all there. It was really lacking something. I did like the pico de gallo though. It was pretty fresh and it added a nice dimension to the taco. 

My friends each got a burrito and they weren't too happy either. Their tortillas split because they were just not the greatest tortillas made (or the person who was heating them up was just too lazy to heat it up enough to make it work)

Will I be coming back? Meh, probably not, but it wasn't horrible- I've just tasted better things."}
{"text":"This place isn't amazing, but it certainly doesn't deserve its abysmal reviews. It's a Lot like chipotle but slightly less good and without a twenty minute wait. I don't know of it's gotten better recently or what, but this isn't a bad place to stop by if you're in the ryerson area. I'll probably be back, sure, mainly due to convenience but back nonetheless"}
{"text":"We have been a couple of times. Fairly capable burritos, quesadillas, etc. - pretty much what you would expect from a chain."}
{"text":"Smallest portions ever and more expensive than burrito boys. Sighs. Wasted 10 dollars"}
{"text":"YUCK! I had the nastiest veggie salad here tonight at the Z-teca at York University. Firstly, it was overpriced, $6.95 (before taxes) for such crap... would make anyone go into an angry rant! Note, not all vegans are peaceful treehuggers who practices ``zen.`` 

Z-teca sucks and I`m never coming back because:
-the salad was disgusting
-it was also expensive
-the ingredients were not fresh: 
-the lettuce was not fresh and dry, and the dude literally gave me a few pieces and had the nerve to call it a salad
-service sucks: dude serving me had no idea what he was doing, what a tool
-they only have ONE kind of beans. WHAT kind of tex-mex place have only 1?
-they charge 1 dollar more for roasted veggies, Mucho Burritos does not
-the hot salsa was NOT hot... very mild, if i`m not gasping for water, then it`s not hot
-they have 2 types of dressings, but they were both NOT-vegan friendly! C`mon! 

And what angers me more is the crap they wrote on their bag:

``in case of Emergency, tear open Bag`` -yea right, it`s more like if you tear open the bag, you`ll find yourself in the Emergency at your nearest hospital

``share the love`` -no... it`s more like, share it with your enemies and recommend it to anyone you hate

``proudly Canadian`` -the Canadian government should make them take that off their bags, website, etc... cos this is not representative of Canada... on the account that their food sucks!

So yeah, Z-teca sucks. Need I say more? NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out after passing by it numerous times and hearing from a coworker that it is the equivalent to Chipotle. Due to the fact that the nearest Chipotle isn't within walking distance and I was craving something of the variety, my curiosity got the best of me.

As one reviewer mentioned, the ingredients that Z-Teca uses are definitely fresh, and the reason as to why the establishment got one star to begin with, however, that's as far as my semi-positive review of this place goes. 

Adopting itself after Chipotle, and even places like Burrito Boyz, Z-Teca definitely misses the mark when it comes to the DIY burrito's and bowl's dealio. I ordered a grilled chicken bowl to-go. Unlike Chipotle and other places they didn't have a selection of rices, leaving the customer to only choose between one... (An option is always nice, especially since customers are obviously subject to having expansive palettes). However, I was willing to overlook this as the rice not only looked good but they also filled the bowl up quite a bit (a little more than halfway), which I was definitely pleased with. Next came the grilled chicken, which they barely added any of; less than half a spoonful. As for the toppings it was the same old, same old: sour cream, cheese, shredded romaine, salsa, corn and guac (extra, of course). They were skimpy as hell on the sour cream... Which when taking into consideration the formulation of a bowl is crucial as it's essential to the incorporation process when trying to mix everything together whilst eating and making everything not \"dry\". And along with that, they also did not add enough cheese. The shredded romaine was cut in way too big of pieces, I prefer thinner slices as they make eating and trying to get more than one thing on the fork at once easier. As for their salsa they definitely tried to up their game in comparison to their competitors via the addition of not only two but five different options. But as a first time eater at this establishment and in fear that I would be coughing up a storm and experiencing a runny nose if I had gotten one of the spicier salsa options I opted for the classic, Pico Di Gallo, settling for one that was definitely mild. The salsa lacked any sort of flavour, and again, of course, they were skimpy on it. Lastly was the corn, one of my favourite things about getting the bowl at Chipotle, but their corn felt extremely watered down and flavourless... Definitely not a good thing and left me heavily disappointed! As for the guac, which you OF COURSE need to pay extra for, BUT is a MUST when eating a bowl or anything of any sort, they were skimpy on... Now this really broke my heart considering I consider the addition of the guac both a necessary and essential part to my bowl eating experience... I could not believe the audacity to add a minuscule dollop... I was tempted to ask for a bit more, but refrained out of fear of being rude and pushy. 

After eating the bowl I came to the realization that the overt addition of the amount of rice acts as a filler so they can skimp on the rest... Since they were so skimpy on the toppings once I got to the end of my bowl, and the last forkful layer of my rice, it was all dry and had nothing on it. Eating just plain dry rice is never fun, especially when you can have it incorporated with so many wonderful flavours, IF the workers just had been a bit more generous... Thus I was disappointed.

This place is definitely not a competitor whatsoever right now when it comes to places of this nature and I think that they definitely need to up their game and follow in the blueprint that those before them have lain out, with their own twists of course! This place definitely has the potential to be great, as it's got the right idea but they really need to focus on their flavours, not skimping and not using the rice as an additive bowl filler. 

If I'm going to be paying the Chipotle price I want the Chipotle quality! Enough said."}
{"text":"I noticed this place serves breakfast so I decided to try them out. I ordered their not so deluxe breakfast. Eggs and bacon were freshly prepared and tasted A OK. Fries were meh though so I ended up throwing them out. Overall not bad considering the price. I suggest that you ask for tomatoes instead of fries."}
{"text":"I found myself coming in here more than I usually would because I was in this area a lot during tiff and I would say that they are more looks than quality. They did offer a 10% discount with a festival ticket so my meals were just a little cheaper than they would have been otherwsie. They don't have a very large menu but they have everything you would look for if you're in the mood for a burrito-themed meal. 

Plenty of seating and I'm a big fan of their interior settings, and in for this particular strip of King St I believe it's the only one where you could expect a quick meal (unless you want Subway). 

Staff were not exceptional but nothing to complain about, and their doors open policy towards the street (at least when the weather is nice) attracted a couple of birds while I was eating, always good to have some entertainment during meal times!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and absolutely love it! Favourite place to go to satisfy my Mexican food cravings. You gotta try the burrito bowl with chipotle sauce!

The only downside is that the food's a bit expensive: I usually pay around $12 for my meal, but you get a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I've been here once a long time ago but I was hammered after leaving Indian Motorcycle Club back in the day so it wasn't on my radar.  I was reminded that this place was here by a buddy so we went there before work the other day.  I ate a burrito and I had to order another one \"to go\" for later that night. The beans weren't refried so I was bummed out and the rice was bland.
Definitely try this place as the food was above average and filling.  I'm not sure but it also seemed \"healthier\" but I may be wrong on this one.
 Coles Notes: Really good, could be better."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch because I was craving a burrito bowl and was hoping it would be the same if not better than Chipotle's version because of the great reviews. The bowl wasn't the same at all. Smaller portion, ingredients weren't as fresh and the chicken pieces were not full pieces, it was more like bits and pieces. After my meal I was unsatisfied left feeling still hungry."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch with my ex colleague in the Commerce Court location. He ordered a grilled chicken burrito and I got a vegetarian bowl. 

A person ahead of us ordered a Shrimp bowl. His bowl was over flowing and mine was not even half full. He paid the same amount as I did. 

The quality of the salad was just plain Ok. The salsa had no flavour. Added a hot sauce but it did revive it. 

According to my friend the chicken was bland as well. 

It was my first and last time."}
{"text":"I'm usually here for their tofu burrito, very filling, decent portions, and reasonable prices. Service is quick. There are plenty of seats if you like to dine in. Grab extra napkins because it will get messy! Overall this is one of my go-to places for lunch and I recommend their tofu burrito."}
{"text":"Had high hopes

I pass here every day on the bus, so I've seen Z-- Teca for a while, I wanted to try it, as I am definitely a fan of burritos.
I finally had the time to try it, the meat was ok, but they put so much rice in the burrito, most places fill the burrito with all the toppings they offer, but here it's just plain white rice.
I kind of felt ripped off and haven't bothered to return."}
{"text":"I am going to have to agree with my fellow compadres and provide a 3- 3.5 star rating for Z-Teca's. I have more of a soft-spot for authentic Mexican than for tex-mex so I can't really bring it up to 4 stars out of principle. Though, that being said it has the basic Mexican elements - rice, blackbeans, guac, and salsa - that are necessary to make an essentially tasty burrito (plus meat for the meat lovers). I like to opt for the veggie burrito bowl ( black beans, corn, and rice) option with a helpful layer of roasted tomatillo and jalepeno verde salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole and ALWAYS add the zesty chiptole ranch dressing. Without the dressing the end product is sub par.

*Please note: My Z-Teca experience was at the York University location in the York Lanes."}
{"text":"Ordered burrito bowl. Meat was fresh and everything tasted okay.  Weird decor - felt very street like because the garbage cans looked like they were literally taken off the street. However, if you are hungry, want something quick while in the Entertainment district, it'll hit the spot."}
{"text":"As said before, pretty pedestrian burrito/taco place. Portions are on the smaller side compared to other places. 

On the plus side the place is clean, bathrooms are large, clean and have motion sensing lights as well as nice steel sinks.

Overall very meh! Unfortunately cause the design and cleanliness are both pretty good but the food fails to impress or make it past par."}
{"text":"Excellent burritos and top-notch customer service .  My burrito was packed so full of food it could barely close.  All fresh and delicious ingredients.  Conveniently located."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick lunch. The décor is nice - there places to sit and there's a patio, which is great for the summer. I ordered the grilled chicken burrito (with grilled vegetables or fajita vegetables, rice, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, and mild salsa). Don't want to sound like a broken record, but the burrito needs more meat and less rice; rice kept falling on to my shirt (thank goodness for Tide sticks). I also feel that for $9 a burrito, there should be some combo deal. This place is a-ok, you won't find me driving all the way to Fairview to grab lunch, but if I'm in the mall, why not?

Good for: quick lunch"}
{"text":"They food. Looks.really old and like it was sitting in the bin all day. I was grossed.out. the tables and it's cold I there too"}
{"text":"I come here often as I'm on campus a lot but I'll have to stop because it's probably the most pricey place compared to other burrito places. The food is pretty decent -- my fave is the tofu salad and I love the fajita veggies. I don't get the bowl because the rice is pretty dry ALL.THE.TIME! Also love their guac but the portions differ depending on who serves it (should be consistent all the time). My other fave is the mango salsa

As for the staff, they're mediocre (don't go out of their way to greet you and say \"have a nice day\"), but not rude either. They work pretty fast though and lines go by fast. They always seem to be out of shrimp at certain times which is a bummer considering I don't eat meat. 

Also pretty spacious with lots of seating. Only thing about that is that the tables are usually dirty so I always go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"It's like the manager thought, \"How can we take Chipotle and make everything worse?\"

Portion sizes are 1/3 the size of Chipotle. 
Everything tastes blander and with less flavor.
They were charging extra for vegetables 

Avoid. Bad businesses deserve to go out of business."}
{"text":"As a burrito-lovin' person, I was glad that Fairview has a place that could serve what should be a filling meal. However, during the meal, and after, I wasn't satisfied. 

I ordered a steak bowl burrito with everything and a spicy hot sauce. The bowl was mostly rice and some veggies and little meat. As I watched the server dish toppings into my bowl, I was disappointed with how much was being served. I'm used to going to other burrito places and getting great value for what I pay. But I brushed it off, hoping quality would outweigh quantity. 

While it tasted okay, the fact that it was mostly rice meant I had to ration every bite... what you see in my picture is pretty much how much meat I was given. The overall flavours were less than average but I ended up still wanting more food after the burrito bowl. Good thing there was a food court nearby. 

I wouldn't recommend this burrito place unless you really are craving anything burrito-tasting and are stuck near the Fairview mall area."}
{"text":"People claim this is better than chipotle.. as I eat it, I start to question \"have they even HAD chipotle!?!?\" because this place has 0 comparison to the queen (chipotle)

This place is a mess, first of all. They really need to enforce the 'no eating at the tables in the restaurant unless you're an actual paying customer'.. how many students with bags of popeyes, thai express, or hero burger end up sprawled out at the tables so that the actual zteca customers have no choice but to carry their food to another part of the school, hopefully to find an empty seat to devour their food at? The lines move quickly though (not as fast as chipotle, but not slow). Their quality is not as great as chipotle because a lot of it doesn't seem fresh as I bite into it, but their steak really had good flavour. The bowl is a bit smaller than chipotle's but then again, it's $2 cheaper. They only have 1 type of rice and 1 type of bean, which is a tiny bit disappointing. 

Let's be honest though- for campus food, it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my condo, so it gets one star for the convenience.

Their burritos are average, not spectacular and nothing to write home about for certain.  However, I do have a special spot in my heart (read belly) for their burrito bowls.  They're quick, relatively healthy, if you ask for less rice, and portion size is ok.

They have a good selection of toppings and I like building my own burrito. 

My issue with this place?  Their prices.  Fairly pricey for what you get, which is average \"Mexican\" food.  However, when hungover or just plain lazy, I'll fork over the cash, albeit begrudgingly."}
{"text":"Great steak burrito salad.  Quick lunch, friendly service.  It's a food court can't expect too much."}
{"text":"Z-teca is BY FAR my favourite burrito in the city. 

I care more about taste and variety than authenticity. The Pork Carnitas is my first pick but I always pick the meat that looks the freshest and juiciest, add some corn, rice, beans, sour cream, cheese and the Roasted Tomatillo & Jalapeno salsa and it's amazing!!

The portions are large and the price is reasonable. I only wish they had a smaller option for the times I'm not quite starving!"}
{"text":"This place is a wannabe Chipotle, just not as good. The burrito (particularly the rice) is a little dry, which is a big deal for \"fresh\" Mexican grill. It's not enough to have a business model that mimics chipotle, Z-Teca needs to live up to Chipotle's standard. A little more attention to freshness can quickly make this place a 4/5."}
{"text":"I visited z-teca on Cinco de Mayo where they were offering $5 burritos. I understand that the typical complaint about z-teca is the long line up, which ends up building anticipation in the mind of the customer. 

I understand that feeling, for if the food isn't so great, why would people be crazy enough to join a queue? Well, on my visit there wasn't a soul to be found, and it could work both ways, -the food could have been crap. It was just a chicken burrito, tightly packed with rice, beans, sour cream and some fresh salsa. I'm not a fan of the appearance of a prepared burrito at chain restaurants, they're too cylindrical, and stuffed.  

The service was very professional and thorough though, -the sole employee was chatting it up with us making us feel really appreciated. The appearance of z-teca is very much like Chipotle in that modern, industrial get-up. They had the urban style garage doors pulled up for the summer heat, creating a patio-like ambiance, and two flat screen TVs switched to City Tv.

I could see this location being perfect for a quick lunch, without being smothered in with the food court, but I think I'm just not that into chain burrito joints."}
{"text":"Came here once before a couple of years ago and had a meh experience that I'd obviously forgotten about when I ended up back here today.  I paid $16 for a bowl filled mostly with lettuce.  Anything that I actually wanted (beans, corn, chicken) was doled out in the most meager of portions.  Even when I paid to add extra chicken, I received the most pathetic dollop.  I felt like Oliver Twist.  Will definitely not be going back, especially when there are new places like Hopscotch so close."}
{"text":"Kind of like Mucho Burrito, with the following exceptions:

1. Worse/less variety in toppings. No cilantro? No fresh jalapeno? No burrito sauce? 

2. Serious topping restrictions require you to put way less on your burrito than you want to. I've gotten used to forking out fextra cash for fresh guacamole, but here it's even the cheap stuff! They're all like, \"Would you like corn OR black beans OR peppers and onions?\" And I'm all like, \"Escoo-me? This is a burrito joint,  put the WORLD in that foil and then ask if I want more! Newsflash! I DO!\" 

3. Nothing is spicy. At all. 

4. More expensive. A lot more expensive. There is only one size, so if you get meat on your burrito its going to cost you $9. What dee..

If you have an extra ten minutes to go to the Mucho Burrito in Brookfield or Freshwest in TD Center, do it."}
{"text":"Ok, this isn't a good burrito place. If you're in the area, and want a wrap with beans, rice and some meat - sure, go for it. But if you want a real burrito this isn't the place to go. Obviously this should be expected, since it's inside a mall? I mostly go here for lunch because I work really close - the service is fast and not too nice/rude (it's just a fast food joint).

I usually get either the carnitas or the beef - the meat isn't as spicy as it should be and doesn't taste authentic.

However, even compared to Chipotle (which I love, yeah it's a guilty pleasure...) I find z-teca burritos dryer and much less satisfying :(

There's plenty of room for you to sit - inside or outside, even during lunch it's not that busy. 

If you want authentic burritos - go to St Clair."}
{"text":"This CIBC Commerce Court eatery is cheap and cheerful. I've had the chicken; steak; and beef barbacoa burritos.  Personally, I prefer to eat here than at the other fast food joints in the place. However, lunch comes to over $10. Final note, whether a burrito or bowl, I still manage to make a mess!"}
{"text":"Z-teca. Not the best burrito joint in town. This one is in the food court level of the Exchange Tower. (The one with the Burger King.) The serious best feature of this Z-teca is after 4 pm until close (about 6 or 7 pm) is burritos are $5 (reduced from $8.25). This deal is likely only available at this location. Amazing deal. Clearly they're trying to finish up what's left but for $5 you can't beat this deal."}
{"text":"The mission style burrito places are a dime a dozen these days. No surprises here. Nothing really wrong. I'd probably go 3.5 stars because the woman behind the counter seemed pretty friendly and on the ball. Lots of seating, the place is clean, offers a quick alternative from the mall food court. I did enjoy my burrito. I found it quite doughy. Most of these places grill the hell out of the burrito and the rice is too dry."}
{"text":"Dead store waiting...

Who ever is working there just does not care or understand..."}
{"text":"It was ok, but nothing special.  Compared to what I get at Chipotle, I felt this place nickel and dimed me.

I think the prices are pretty much the same.  I got the chicken bowl in a large container but the food barely filled the container half way.  Food was just ok, could have gotten more food for the price I was paying.

They charge extra for coin or roasted green peppers and onions (faijta vegetables) so I'd prefer Chiptole for that alone.

It's a decent option in the area at night if you don't want to go to a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Dropped in heut it was clean and Modern. I was able to have a Multi Grain Wrap first off. Then I was afraid they would chalk this full of Rice (filler). But they didn't. I had a Pork Burrito, with all manner of nice Veg, cheese. I also like it Hot, so they chopped a whole fresh Jalapeno into it for me. This was a Big Burrito in the end. Held under a Hot Press for a minute. It was damn tasty and filling. At over $10 ea, it better be a good size. I was very Satisfied."}
{"text":"The streets were extremely crowded on Sunday thanks to both a Blue Jays game and the Toronto International Film Festival making King St W a crowded mess. After walking a little ways down we spotted Z-Teca off to the side and figured now would be a good time to enjoy a nice fat burrito. This was my first time visiting Z-Teca and I was pleasantly surprised by how big the inside was, how nice the staff was, and how packed the burrito was too. I ended up ordering the special chorizo burrito (I'm a sucker for anything with (chorizo) and like I said, I was pretty happy with how big the thing was. Upon taking my first bite I was sold, this was a dang good burrito! The meat was flavourful and juicy, the vegetables were fresh, and it was wrapped nice and tight. The burrito was actually so big that I was a coward and only managed to finish half of it inside the restauraunt. Overall, this place exceeded my expectations and I would certainly stop here in the future for another burrito!"}
{"text":"I consider myself something of a burrito expert now; and so in my expert opinion, this is not for you if you've been to :Burrito boys, Burrito bandidos, Chipotle.

I am CERTAIN I ordered hot salsa which didn't turn out to be all that hot - I wonder now if having mild salsa along with the hot one, cancelled the whole hotness for me.

I have to say that this is the first place who gave me my burrito 5 minutes after ordering -which impressed me until I opened the foil and realized that my burrito is all mushy and not toasty. I realized today, that the toasted-ness was essential because it gives it shape and helps you hold on to your bundle. 

The burrito is plain - except for the overwhelming sour cream you taste - which is not cool. Even under best circumstances, sour cream + any sort of rice - is not cool , even though I love each of them equally.

The good thing is that it IS filling without the awful side affects of itis. he tortilla is so big (or maybe they don't put enough ingredients?) that there is no chance of burrito bursting, which is a common phenomena for burritos from the above mentioned places...which also eliminated the need for lengthy toasting.

I found the \"Rip into bag in case of emergency\" also amusing because the bag is a open paper bag.

I would recommend walking a little further to Burrito Boyz -but if your craving is not allowing you to walk that distance, just around the corner is Burrito bandidos. You get a better ,bigger, toaster deal for your buck there."}
{"text":"As far as food court meals go in the PATH, this is about as good as it gets.....hence the extra star.  Not cheap but certainly not expensive by any stretch.  The large burrito is far more than I can eat in one sitting. I was prepared to be very disappointed after reading the reviews here BUT.....surprise, surprise my burrito was quite decent.  I don't care for rice in my burrito and that wasn't a problem.  The guacamole was very good, vegetables were better than average, I like the whole wheat tortilla option, etc.  This is by far the best \"food court\" meal I've had in the Commerce Court.  I no longer feel the need go to Burrito Boyz, which has gone downhill BTW.  You can find places that will make a better burrito....but not in the PATH."}
{"text":"Quite good food here, the burritos are actually good and healthy tasting as well. The menu may seem a little confusing at first but once you know what you're ordering you will be satisfied. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but it definitely satisfied a burrito craving."}
{"text":"This is an average place. Given a choice, I'd prefer a Chipotle.

We got the chicken quesadilla which was okay. There wasn't enough cheese and filling so most of the quesadilla was just the wheat tortilla. The tortilla itself is okay.

The veggie burrito was average as well. There was nothing wrong with the individual components, except perhaps the salsa felt weak but everything together failed to impress.

I'd recommend looking around for another place."}
{"text":"I eaten a lot of burritos over the years, and the last time i tried z-teca was a least a year and a half ago. I heard they had new management and staff so I thought I would give it another shot.

I ordered a burrito bowl, basically a burrito without the tortilla which turned out to be a mountainous pile of rice, a large tablespoon of beef, a tiny sprinkle of cheese, and poor array of toppings. The servers don't tell you about the other toppings unless it's extra. Oh, you want corn, that's $1 more, oh you want guacamole, that's another dollar. Too many of the toppings have onions, why can't I have some tomatoes without onions? onions in the back beans, onions in Guacamole, onions in the salsa, so when you go back to work, everyone's eyes water when you talk to them. I suspect the over abundance of onions is to compensate for the lack of flavor in everything. It's just not cutting it.

Where are the toppings?  Refried or Black Beans? Green Peppers? Jalapenos? Tomatoes? Cilantro? choices of Cheeses? Sauces? Chipotle, Hot, Lime?

I have to say the meat portioning is pathetic. I mean really, a $10 burrito with 3 oz of cheap meats is insulting. It's not like the meat is fillet, or sirloin. These are poor cuts of meat cooked all day to make them tasty. The only redeeming quality is the meat does have a little flavor. The other burrito places put anywhere between 10% and 50% more meat. And it's not just the meat, it's the whole unbalanced taste of the whole thing. Rice, rice, and more rice whether it's a burrito or a burrito bowl.

I wish this place was better, I truly do. But it's just not. I feel ripped off every time I eat here. A big pile of rice with prison rationing of meat, and onions in everything make this a no go. 

Everyday I walk by z-teca and it's mostly empty. It's like management is completely oblivious that they have a problem, and it's the food/value proposition. I feel sorry for the place. I just want to call Ramsey to get in there a fix it. Another interesting observation is they never have anything cooking or on the stove. It's strange, it's like it's just there for show. I asked others that go there, and they said they've never seem anything cooking either. weird.

There are 7 other burrito places in a 2-3 block radius including Quesada on Wellington, Burrito Bandidos on Peter,  Burrito Boys on Adelaide, FreshWest in the Simcoe Place and in TD food court, and Chipotle mexican just opened on Front and University.  A little further out is Mucho Burrito.  I suggest you try the other contenders for a tastier, more balanced and better value experience."}
{"text":"This was the worst disappointment ever.   Gross weird cold sticky toppings (no ground beef .... Isn't that the basic ingredient in a burrito ?)
No real burrito sauces ... Choices look three days old.

Box of lettuce $12 ... Do NOT eat here"}
{"text":"Ok I'm giving 2 stars (instead of 1)  because maybe they had an off night.

Pros: Awesome decor

Cons: 

1. The service was shit. I waited for almost 5 minutes while there was only 1 person in front of me, then the cheeky guy tries to serve the hot blonde who was waiting behind me next! 

2.  The mixed up spicy with medium!!! I wanted spicy, my 2 friends wanted medium but apparently the spicy and the medium bowls were reversed or something...

3. The rice was bland. And I hate it when guacamole is an optional extra.

4. Consistency is an issue here. Ok so the girl after me was cute, but why does she get more burrito toppings?? I have the bigger appetite!!

It looks like this place has potential, but they need to work the kinks out. I'm sticking with the Boyz."}
{"text":"While it pains me to see all the bad reviews this place is getting, I do agree that on the most part it's bland. Living nearby however, I've perfected my order to extract one helluva burrito.

My order: shrimp burrito, don't need to add guac or corn, but ask for all three salsas (mild, medium, and hot; skip the mango).

The shrimp, freshly grilled, doesn't suffer from any of the dryness the chicken experiences, and all those salsas lead to flavour country (may get a bit messy depending on how heavy handed the servers are).

Should I have to abuse my burrito with all three salsas to enjoy it? No; and if I didn't live nearby I probably wouldn't frequent this place as much as I do. But, whatev.

Note: they do grill their burrito prior to serving, unlike their step-brother Chipotle."}
{"text":"Decent burrito place. This is the only location I've been to but they are a Canadian chain restaurant.  I always get the steak. It is similar to the Chipotle in concept but I prefer Chipotle because it is a lot tastier. Price for a burrito after tax runs about 8.50"}
{"text":"A bog standard chain burrito place, it gains a star because all the other places around here are tourist traps run by terrible people. It then loses one because the guacamole is extra and that makes me sad."}
{"text":"Decent lunch option in the Commerce Court food court. I like to get the rice or salad bowls, which consists of what you would get inside a burrito but it's deconstructed into a rice or salad based bowl. You and pick and choose what you want in your bowl. Portion is pretty decent, will fill you up."}
{"text":"This is for all locations and I've been to there.  You barely get any meat or beans and the fast does nothing for me.  I'm more satisfied with supermarket bottled salsa with homemade rice, beans, and meat.  

On one occasion, I got a cramps after having a burrito (Adelaide/Queen location).

My recent experience wasn't much better so I won't try ever again.  I went to the North York Center location and although they were polite, one of the servers (guy) lacked listening and communication skills and messed up my order and long story short, I was sent to the back of the line to re-order and another server said I couldn't get what I wanted and when I was about to walk off, she verified I could (duh!!!!) and they made it correctly this second time, but it was very tasteless and small for what you pay for.  I could barely see the tiny pieces of chopped chicken and the fried fish stick was not good (not sure what it was; old oil taste as in reusing the same oil?), and the beans were just as tasteless.

Sorry, but if I pay $10 I shouldn't require I microscope to see them!!!!  Their food is of poor quality, taste, and quantity.  Unable to taste the chicken and the salsas did not add flavour!  I don't understand how people love Z-Teca."}
{"text":"I was starving and this place, as everybody noticed, serves HUGE burritos. 

I decided to choose a \"burrito salad\" - without the tortilla, and asked for grilled shrimps. For 6.95, I thought it was an awesome deal. The shrimps took a while to grill, and my husband had his default beef burrito prepared while my shrimps were being grilled. 

I had to ask for NO MORE TOPPINGS PLEASE, otherwise I wouldn't be able to eat what I had ordered. They kind of insist for you to buy drinks, and this bothered me a little.  Also I felt almost no spice on the food but they offer extra hot sauce (it's not the best solution though)

The place is fancy and I loved the décor. I hid there for a while during a storm and felt comfortable."}
{"text":"Z-teca has always felt like a crappy friend - the kind that hypes up everything and not being able to deliver. Some of my beefs with Z-teca:

- too much rice
- no fresh cilantro
- beans are OPTIONAL 
- no sizing
- no discounts or combination with your purchases

When you cut open the burrito, it's mostly rice. And while it's tasty (and questionably vegetarian), I think it's ridiculous that I have to choose between beans, roasted corn and vegetables (2 out of 3). 

It's a meal, but a half-assed one at that. 

Goodbye, Z-teca. It's over for you and me!"}
{"text":"I've tried both the steak and shrimp burrito bowls here and hands down the shrimp one was sooooooo much better. It came with 8 sauteed shrimps that were perfectly seasoned. The guy that made my burrito bowl was really friendly, he even brought it to my table instead of having me pick it up from the counter. The music was a little louder than I'd like it to be, and the AC was super strong but that's probably because I was studying. My total was $12.99 for the burrito bowl combo with a canned pop and a bag of tortillas with my choice of salsa. I also paid $1 extra for guacamole but it was so worth. $15 total for everything I've got is a lil pricey but I love shrimp burrito bowls (if only the portion was larger) and I don't come here often so oh well!"}
{"text":"Freshly-made burritos, just as \"fresh\" as a certain large chain sandwich joint's and treated about the same. Chicken and beef sit in liquid in warming containers as do most warm ingredients. Extra charge for veggies or guacamole doesn't sit right when a burrito itself is $8-9. The chain-ness of z-teca means that the contents always taste precisely the same and you can decide for yourself whether that's a good thing or not. A non-beef or chicken burrito didn't seem to contain much of the requested protein.
Pluses are that the burrito gets grilled when it's finished being assembled, but it might be necessary just for food safety to bring the hot ingredients back to a safe temperature. A variety of beverages, including beer, are available.
The atmosphere is positively industrial inside, lots of metal in the seating area, food served on metal trays in metal, and chairs that appear to be made with wood chips."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch and ordered the shrimp burrito bowl. First of all half the rice in it was uncooked. The veggies tasted old and stale. The shrimp was probably the only good thing. I got it with sour cream and hot sauce. The hot sauce wasn't hot at all. Definitely disappointing especially spending close to $12 for a small portion. Not your traditional burrito bowl. Didn't feel good eating it : ("}
{"text":"If you want ok mexican food and you go to z-teca then try out z-teca.  Personally I think its just ok but the prices are very reasonable for a burrito/burrito bowl.  The food quality is alright (don't get the pork carnitas though, it's super dry.) but its still a fast food place."}
{"text":"Lame, lame Chipotle (also lame) knockoff with decent decor (brushed metal lunch tables). \"Gourmet Burritos\"-- OK concept, but the cardinal rule is that the cheaper the mexican food, the better the mexican food. Gourmet has nothing to do with it unless you're in San Miguel de Allende. 

Dry chicken practically had me wheezing and the salsa tasted like tin cans. And where the *** are the corn tortillas? 

Can someone get me a real tortilla? A corn one, not a wheat one? I'm desperate!"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I dropped by here so I could grab a quick bite.  Upon walking in during the middle of a Saturday afternoon we noticed the place was completely empty - which was weird.

There was an older Filipino gentlemen near the cash talking to someone in the back room, but even though he saw us there he refused to come help us.  Not even a hello.  We thought maybe he was the cook, but still he didn't even acknowledge us. 

You would think a place with no customers would be happy to take the order of anyone walking through the door, but not this place.

Horrible customer service and I now see why it was likely so dead.  I'd be suprised if this place is still here in a year."}
{"text":"Super surprised to see these mixed reviews for my favourite burrito chain in Toronto. Having tried Chipotle, Burrito Boyz, Chino Locos, etc., I've found that z-teca delivers on freshness and taste every single time. I usually go for the grilled chicken burrito on a white tortilla, though steak is a close second. I think the winning formula is to opt for corn and rice - you can skip the beans. Z-teca also has the most awesome tortillas of the above burrito chains. They're so soft and have this kind of chewy, gluten-y texture that make me reluctant to ever do a burrito bowl instead (I'm looking at you, Chipotle). 

For those intimately acquainted with the brutalist architecture and never-ending construction that is the York University campus, you'll have heard that the business kids never leave their building. This is actually a common misconception, I've ventured out numerous times for z-teca burritos. If you're questioning giving this place a shot, just turn away from the reviews and check out the lunchtime lines - that'll tell you all you need to know!"}
{"text":"Although they claim to be gourmet there was nothing gourmet about the burrito bowl I received. Chipotle is far superior. Food was average at best and was overpriced."}
{"text":"I am afraid z-teca doesn't pass muster on at least three fronts--1. Flavor--nothing seems spicy, not even the hot sauce (sic), 2. Taste--I can't wait to finish the meals versus yearning for more at Chipotle, 3. Price--I could eat in at most Mexican restaurants for lesser.

Interestingly, the lines are long-- it must be the winter and the paucity of Mexican options nearby.  To their credit, the lines move quickly.  The burrito bowls, tacos, quesadillas and everything else is a step down from Chipotle.  I have not tried the chips, but I suspect it's not going to be an outlier.

I will be back at z-teca when I am eating in the Path at Commerce Court.  Sometimes you have to value diversity over quality."}
{"text":"For fast-food burritios, Z-Teca is my favourite place to go in Toronto. When it comes right down to it, it's pretty hard to screw up a burrito. It's rice, beans, cheese, and meat rolled up in a tortilla. As long as the tortilla isn't stale and the fillings are cooked to an even mediocre quality you've got yourself a serviceable burrito. That being said, there are more than enough places that find a way to get it wrong. Z-Teca offers steak, chicken, pork, and seasoned beef as meat choices, all of which are delicious. I typically get chicken but the seasoned beef is a real treat. It's worth mentioning that all of their meat is grilled and sliced; no ground meat or microwave shenanigans at all which scores big points with me. Their fillings give you more options than your typical burrito bar with grilled \"fajita vegetables\" (peppers and red onions) and grilled corn (my personal favourite). They offer mild, medium, and spicy salsa and I like that their medium salsa has a noticeable kick to it unlike other medium salsas that err on the side of bland in so many other places. They also offer guacamole but at a $1 incremental charge which is the one strike I'd give against Z-Teca. What sets Z-Teca apart from other burrito bars in Toronto is the fact that they don't try to over-season their contents. Beans, rice, meat, and cheese create a great medley of flavours and textures on their own yet I'm always surprised at how often Mexican places douse their food in generic taco seasoning which kills the natural flavour of everything in the burrito. While some would assert that this may make Z-Teca's burritos \"inauthentic\" I prefer to say that Z-Teca takes a \"less is more\" approach to their seasoning to great effect. I wish, like I do for all burrito bars in Toronto, that they'd make their own tortillas or acquire ones freshly made that day. I'd gladly pay a dollar or two more to eliminate pre-packaged tortillas."}
{"text":"A nice Mexican joint within the Fairview area. I ordered a Beef Barbacoa. Unfortunately, they ran out of sour cream when I ordered so I told them to put a lot of Chipotle Ranch. I was also able to try their rice topping which contains cilantro. I don't like cilantro so I asked the server if I could sample it and he allowed. Surprisingly, I could barely taste the cilantro so I got it added into my burrito. I also got Jarritos Mango. The burrito tasted great with the chipotle ranch, the taste made me not care that they didn't have any sour cream. Although, I wasn't a big fan of Jarritos Mango, it was very fizzy and a bit too sweet for me. Interior looks pretty cool and the stafg were really kind and friendly. Overall, if you're craving Mexican, reach Z-Teca."}
{"text":"For a fast food chain, this is serviceable food. The various ingredients are within view and you can build you own burrito/quesadilla/tacos. I view this as a North American chain and not a Mexican chain. I know. They sell Mexican dishes such as tacos and quesadillas but these are not authentic Mx. And don't get me started on burritos, an American invention!

At any rate, this is relatively simple food that can satiate any craving. I had a tortilla soup (definitely not the authentic kind, but I wanted a small soup) and a cheese quesadilla. 

Expensive fast food compared to Mc Donald's but never regrets when eaten."}
{"text":"We thought of enjoying Cinco De Mayo by eating burrito at zteca and this was our first time at this place. Expectations were really high and did not meet it. I like the ambience and service of this place but burrito was average. I was expecting huge rush of flavours at my first bite and was like any average one. Spicy sauce was not that spicy and expected salsa with some twist like every burrito joint has. Burrito was heavily stuffed and was good enough for dinner which was the best part."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good spot for a reasonably priced Mexican-style fast-food meal on King St. It's essentially an establishment in the spirit of Chipotle and Q-Doba in that you can instruct the person behind the counter how to build your bowl, burrito, etc. while you watch. My first visit to a Z-teca was in Madison, WI. I was very favorably impressed as it was the first time I had tried a place like this. That franchise was purchased by Q-Doba, however, and it has been a long time since I have seen a Z-teca, let alone patronize one.

The location on King St. is convenient in that it is easy to find in a heavily trafficked area and is set among a plethora of other dining and retail activity. The facility is nothing special but it is clean and offers decent seating capacity. I went in on a Thursday evening and and there were perhaps four or five other parties, mostly dining alone, which allowed for a quiet atmosphere. The service was timely and polite.

I tried a bowl with chicken containing my choice of options. I was happy with the taste as the ingredients were fresh and tasty. The price was more than reasonable as my bowl along with a sparkling water and a small tip was only $14 CAD. Our head office is just a short distance from this place so I am sure I will be going there again."}
{"text":"This is another PATH spot that always seem to generate a line up in the Commerce Court food court.  During lunch, it's easy to see at least 4 or 5 people in line waiting for their 'fresh' burritos to be made. I'm all for tasty Mexican food and even quasi Mexican food but this isn't it.  It's mostly filler (mediocre rice) and some haphazard vegetables thrown in.  For the price, it's really not worth it.  

I will admit the whole choose your own adventure is pretty common for Toronto food but it has it's novelty because you get to eat what you like.  Vegetables are common fare but sadly they're fall flat on flavour.  Tomatos are too firm and yellowy-orange.  Lettuce is slightly limp.  Carrots are tough... you get idea.  Thanks for the selection but where's the flavour.  I ordered the grilled chicken with the chipotle adobo marinade.  Sounds great doesn't it... All I tasted was protein.  No char (though you cant expect that in an underground food court), spices, or flavour.

Overall, this is a convenient and fast operation but the flavour and price makes you want to try something else soon after 3 bites.  Mucho Burrito is slightly better but with Burrito Boyz a semi close walk to the downtown core, that seems like the best place to grab a real burrito."}
{"text":"Everything here is kinda standard. Usual burrito place menu - burritos, bowls, salads, etc. Boring and not enough selection. 

I got a salad and it was just a big pile of lettuce with about 3oz of meat and some beans and other burrito toppings thrown on top. Kind of a rip of for $10, I was definitely still hungry afterward. 

Interior is clean and there's more seating than your standard take out type place. 

Nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"Although a little pricey. $7.95 for a chicken burrito, $8.95 for a steak burrito and $8.25 for a beef baracoa burrito, it still is the best burrito I've had in Toronto.

These by no way compare to the Burritos in San Francisco, but they are still better than Burrito Boys in my opinion. Although when drunk, late at night, I'm sure Burrito Boys tastes like Heaven. Dont get me wrong, Burrito Boys is good too, but I'd give them 4.75 stars out of 5 for Toronto Burrito standards and Z-teca gets 5."}
{"text":"i am surprised that this place has such low reviews
i went 2 times before, and both times myself and my sister and mom were satisfied
yes it isn't any chipotle but it is still good for a fast food joint in a mall
the portions are big and they have alcohol! i rem them having red sangria-wish they had white tho :(
i would go back again"}
{"text":"My review of this place is a little late as I actually tried z-teca back when they had just opened. Since Burrito Boyz rules these streets it is hard to actually choose some place new over a delicious staple. But our wallets were forced when the lineup for BB's was out the door and we didn't want to wait.

So off to z-teca. I like the decor in there, especially because its really bright. The furniture is a wood with metal ensemble, reminding me of an unfinished structure. Unfortunately my memory is a little vague at this place but some points do stick out in my head.

1) They don't grill/fry/whatever you call it that they do at Burrito Boyz. Instead they put it in a panini press type thing.
2) They seemed to be very particular about how much of each scoop of stuff they put on. This may be a function of the fact they were new.
3) They charge for guacamole. I don't know what it is about this 'dressing', but it baffles me why places continue to charge for this. Why not charge for hot sauce?
4) The guy serving us was nice. There were two guys, one of which I'm sure was the owner of the place trying to get his business up and running.
5) The guy gave me and my wife each a sampling of their tortilla chips. They make them in house and are made with corn rather than flour. They were nicely salted and pretty good.

To sum it up, I would say that their burrito is still not as good as BB, but they do offer the advantage of less wait, and more non burrito options. I would like to try this place out again now that they have been in business for a while."}
{"text":"Now lettuce is not included in a basic order so you have to pay extra for it. The portions are small and when you ask for extra of anything they give you attitude. Not worth 12 bucks, go to chipotle!"}
{"text":"These guys rock. I'm grubbing the shrimp burrito down as I type and my wife's digging the shrimp 50/50 burrito bowl/salad. Fresh and great price!"}
{"text":"This used to be my choice for lunch amongst all other unhealthy options in the mall. At least you have the option of replacing rice with lettuce and not add what you consider fattening, such as sour cream and cheese. They used to be much better regarding the taste and the amount of toppings, but recently I've noticed some changes. I don't want to say I'm disappointed, but you should have more expectations for the $11 burrito sandwich (Guacamole is an extra charge!)"}
{"text":"I came here after a class. It's fast and filling food. Like Subway but for burritos, you choose the ingredients and build your burrito with rice, beans, veggies, sauce and all that jazz. The place had a lot of seating and was laid back.
I was hungry. I was fed. I was full. I was treated like someone who paid $10 for their lunch would be treated. Life went on."}
{"text":"Ok, to be clear if this place was not in the PATH (which provides nothing but mediocre lunch options for all of us poor financial district dwellers that it holds hostage) it would maybe have a 2 person line, sometimes. Instead it has an unexplainable line every lunch hour so go late, or early.

While I agree it's no authentic Burrito, and how I miss the Mission in SF for that, as far as PATH options go, it's not that bad. 

Here's how to almost make it a 4 star option - customize the burrito to hell: No rice, double meat, add grilled corn, add fajita veggies, add guac, and tomatillo as well as spicy salsa.  The only problem - it becomes an $11 or $12 burrito."}
{"text":"Nothing really stood out about this place for me.  The burrito was pretty good but easily could have been better.  A pro about this place is that their hot sauce is actually hot.  They need to add some spice or something as the carnitas just seemed bland.

The decor is nice, but kind of feels like a Chipotle ripoff.  

I would probably go back if I was in the area and looking for lunch, but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Z-teca really falling short even with my limited Burrito experience.

Ok I have Chino Locos... their Burritos are freaking awesome!! Something I dream about and I am down doomed... rating everything against theirs!

Z-teca burritos I just cannot stand it! The grilled chicken I have hardly have any chicken inside. The wrapping is just so doughy and it is just stuffed with tons of blend tasting of rice and veggie...

Even drowning it with hot sauce did not improve the taste at all! I love Todasco, if heavy dose of Todasco cannot revive this burritos...nothing will!!

The interior I find it a little cold.. with all the metals deco and the wooden chairs just downright uncomfortable!

No I will not be eating another Z-teca burrito even someone is buying! :)"}
{"text":"Another burrito making restaurant, but I love it. Great location, surrounded by tons of other restaurants. The set up is very similar to other burrito places, you choice your style, meat, salsa, etc... Everything looked pretty good and the food tasted really fresh. I could see myself ending up here again if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"I only tried them twice; one for chicken bowl and the other for the veggie bowl. I was not impressed with the lack of flavour, they serve bigger carb portions then chicken so its not worth the price. in addition to blandness, the chicken and veggies are served room temperature. 

they charge close to chipotle when they're not close. this place needs a better vision to survive the burrito market."}
{"text":"The contents of the burrito was a mass of bland mush.
The rice was over cooked with the occasional dry chalky grains, the hottest salsa I asked for was not hot at all, I couldn't make out the cheese, and the pulled pork was a boiled mess with no discernable taste.

The restaurant looks like it was modelled after Chipotle Mexican Grill (my favorite burrito joint), from the menu and ingredients, to the assembly line, to the design of the restaurant, however it falls short on all levels (like a cheap knock off). The burrito wasn't that huge and definitely not worth my $8.
Eventhough I am not a fan of Burrito Bandidos, I would rather go there instead.

After I had my burrito, I didn't feel satisfied and felt a little gross. What a waste of real estate in my tummy."}
{"text":"With a change of management this has become my favorite burrito spot! I've been coming here for a few years to see various changes in employees and flavor. They've got it right this time. Best quac hands down."}
{"text":"When it comes to downtown food court burritos this place is not too bad.  Lots of options:  beef, chicken, vegetarian, pork, as well salads.  They are a good size, not as big as Chipotle or Burrito Boys but good for lunch.

Arrive early, there will be a line up and it moves slow.  It's nice that they press grill it at the end but I think that adds to the long wait.   I usually get a burrito bowl just because it's faster."}
{"text":"I like! I've been here twice and both times my chicken bowl was of good value and very tasty!


I'm not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from, although I saw they had a sign saying they were under new management."}
{"text":"Truly wretched. Tiny portions, disgusting food, high prices and inexplicably huge lines. My God: even on the veggie bowl, you have to pay extra if you want all three of beans, corn and grilled veggies. Mucho Burrito in brookfield place is not going to win many culinary awards, but it is light-years better than this disaster. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Expensive, not particularly inspired but decent burritos in a cafeteria setting."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful. 

I thought I ordered a whole wheat steak burrito. What I got was some sloppy what-looked and tasted like-processed-cheese-too-much-rice-bad tasting mess. Think I have to take a vodka shot just to get the nasty taste out of my mouth.

Thank goodness I only paid $7 for one of those daily deals. For the price you pay here you can go to either Big Fat Burrito or Burrito Boyz and get something way tastier and worth your money. I do not recommend wasting your money here.

Two-stars because the service was good."}
{"text":"Ordered through the Grabb app.  Waited for 20 mins without any update.  Had to go to them and ask about my order.  Turns out they didn't even check the app for new orders.  Had to wait 10 more mins for it.  Was very annoyed since I only had an hour lunch time before going back to the office.  Disappointed enough to not go back again.  I don't recommend the tacos either.  They're cheaper than buster's sea cove next to them but just doesn't taste as good.  Had the battered cod burrito and it was mostly rice and fish.  Where are all the other toppings I ordered?!"}

I saw couple small cubes of chicken and small sliver of lettuce. It was all mainly rice.
