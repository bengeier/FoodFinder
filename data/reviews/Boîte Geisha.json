{"text":"I like sushi...real sushi so i was surprised to see a \"fusion\" sushi place get such high reviews. After trying it, it's not bad at all. First, their rice is good: not just cooked properly but finally a somewhat affordable sushi place with properly seasoned rice. One down side, it's very slow to get serve. So i suggest to order early, and.. it's good."}
{"text":"Went there on Christmas. Not knowing that they were actually closed we walked in and they explained that they were closed but said that since it is Christmas we were welcome to stay! Had the best sushi here! Owners are Japanese and just the best people you could ever meet! If you are in Montreal this is the only place to get sushi!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I ever had in my life. I've been eating all over the world and this place us simply amazing and affordable."}
{"text":"we had a really solid new year's Eve 2016/17 here - one chef challenged some to eat wasabi for a free specialty roll. I ordered the chef's choice double dinner and split with a friend, it was incredible  highly recommended"}
{"text":"Une décoration aux couleurs de l'Asie, une variété alimentaire de sushis! Le commerce appartient à deux jumeaux Viet et Nam. Non ce n'est pas une blague, l'un s'appelle bien Viet et l'autre Nam! Original non? Côté nourriture, c'est leur père, un chef cuistot, qui leur a appris le secret des sushis. Vous pouvez prendre à emporter ou bien vous installer tranquillement sur place pour déguster."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Made with love and plenty of flavors! Fresh, affordable with great personalized service from the twin chefs....it's the perfect joint for a cozy dinner or lunch or even take out. Fusion at its best! Ask for the specialities of the house - you will love them!"}
{"text":"Soupe miso remarquable. Leurs sushis sont bien exécutés et succulents. Beaucoup de savoir faire."}
{"text":"Un bon endroit pour prendre des sushis pour livraison quand mes préférés sont fermés ! Les plateaux sont sympas. Par contre dès qu'on est 2, il faut prendre 2 plateaux (parce qu'on est des grands gourmands) mais ils mettent les mêmes sushis dans les 2, c'est un peu dommage :("}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have great deals on sushi and the food is amazing! The best part is the food is fresh!! I've been coming here for years! The staff is very friendly :)"}
{"text":"Friendly and prompt service. Succulent sushi at very good price. Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Ok, yep: these folks rock the sushi hard! It was late in the evening last night and a sushi hankering came over me that just wouldn't quit. Thankfully, these guys were open an hour later than the other sushi shops in the heart of the Plateau, so I quickly did some Yelp research on them. You see all those raving reviews (below this one) - they weren't wrong. This sushi is sooooo right. And, I didn't get any attitude at all despite the fact that I showed up with my sushi demands right before they closed (tip: I did call ahead to tell them I was on my way over). They were on it! Extremely friendly staff, accommodating and efficient. I ran home in the rain with sushi-anticipation drool, and devoured those rolls almost in a single bite. MMMMMMMMM, the tempura tidbits were perfect, and I'm picky about tempura! I'm all about the raw scallops, the tender little asparagus bits, just enough cream cheese... everything made fresh for you right then and then. My partner made special note of all the TLC that went into the preparation. Thanks, Geisha Box, now we know: there's a new sushi slinger for us, and we'll be back a LOT."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi and the price are very good! I do every week order delivery and sometime I eat there also. my favorite are : la langue de dragon and the spicy mango"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi. Cool rolls at a decent price. I live close and it's nice to have it here."}
{"text":"It was my best buddy bday so sushi treat it was. We ordered quite a bit of food, for $80 i think for two. Was it good? He seemed to like it. I was a bit disappointed but can't say it wasn't good. A one time random occurrence at most to this place."}
{"text":"I love it here! All the other sushi places are closed on Mondays and closed during certain times on other days. But Boîte Geisha is always open! The sushi is great and it's reasonably priced. It makes more sense to order take-out from here rather then dining in because it's a small place, seats 15 people total I think. They always have good music playing, too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I am a sushi connoisseur, I have traveled the world and ate in large, small, fancy, family-styled, name it all: all kinds of sushi restaurants and I have to say I was beyond impressed with their sushi. The sushi is delicious. Try their DRAGON TONGUE: house specialty crispy with a kick. It's succulent! Their fish is fresh, service is friendly, sushi rolls are innovative and prices are competitive. I absolutely recommend this place!!! The restaurant is small so make sure to reserve if you want to dine it."}
{"text":"Great sushi quality for such casual settings! Basic sushis as well an in-house creations are offered for takeout or dine in for a great price (most rolls under $10). Great side dishes available, such as tartares.  Vietnamese owners, but they master their craft!"}
{"text":"I've become a regular i absolutely love how fresh the sashimi are fresh and the elaborated sauces they have and just the variety if rolls i haven't order the same stuff i've gone qt least 6 times now! i go at least once a week, seriously this place is under rated and probably the best take out sushi you can get in mtl that beats most sit down places in Montreal price is reasonable for 2, you get out with 60$. Same quality as Park i westmount just in a smaller place 10 tables but most ppl get to go. LOVE IT. Great costumer service too always the same lady at the cash, i hope they never franchise it to keep the quality intact."}
{"text":"Hands down, THE BEST sushi in Montréal! I love the decor of the restaurant, and I love the presentation of the dishes they serve. This is my go-to place from now on. I tried a quarter of their menu and thought each dish was delicious! The samurai, the pizza sushi, and the tuna tataki are my favorites. Pic attached - Tuna Tataki"}
