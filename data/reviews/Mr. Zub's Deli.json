{"text":"As i lay on my deathbed,  i highly recommend you NOT to get the tuna melt. The service was excellent as the gentleman brought my order to my car, however, the food not so much.  Within the hour of consuming my sub i began to have stomach pain. To spare the gruesome details,  48 hours later, i am able to hold down a meal.  It willbe a long while before i am able to consider ordering again. I'll have to just keep it simple, i guess."}
{"text":"Excellent pastrami and corned beef sandwich very friendly staff. If ever back in the Kent area I will return. And would recommend to my friends and family"}
{"text":"Amazing service!  My Margo Tenenbaum was absolutely delicious. They ran out of cucumber, so they offered to replace it with anything else, so I got some sprouts and lettuce - absolutely divine. The gentleman who took our order was very sweet and apologetic about the lack of cucumber. I will definitely be back. This was my first time at this establishment, but the whole experience was so pleasant, that I can see myself become a regular."}
{"text":"Tonight I met my new friend, The Duke. The Duke has shaved roast beef, cheese bbq, jalapenos, and onion rings. He is magical. Might be one of the best sammies I've ever had. Top 5 for sure. I was highly impressed both with the quality and speed of service. It doesn't hurt that this place is connected to the Water Street Tavern where I enjoyed a $2 happy hour beer and some great blues music."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! Their sandwiches are unique and delicious. I am never disappointed by either locations. When it opened in Kent, I wasn't sure they would keep up their same level of quality but I have not been disappointed. My Uncle Rico tastes fantastic, whether I get it in Akron or Kent. It's connected to The Water Street Tavern, so you can either order from inside the bar or walk up to their takeout window and order there. My favorite items are the tried and true Hightower and Uncle Rico."}
{"text":"Service was very fast!   The sandwich combinations are interesting and different from the normal.  Where you eat the food is on the bar next door.  The music was pretty loud. I wanted to love the chicken philly I selected but it was mediocre.  The bun was excellent.  Chicken was grilled and flavorful but rubbery.  Canned mushrooms.  :(   Higher quality ingredients would go far here."}
{"text":"First time here.

Underwhelmed is the best way describe this. I listen to people scream all day how amazing this place is but meh.  I got a Sam Rothstein order of fries and mozzarella sticks.

Fries are trash, straight cut unsalted unflavored. I am really upset I paid for those.

Mozzarella sticks were probably the best thing in there but they clearly were undercooked. Good flavor but could have been so much more.

Sandwich was underwhelming. I dont know how pastrami and capicola taste bland but No flavor. I have no idea how. This was also upsetting. 

Another note. Does not help that they threw a pickle in a brown paper bag and my front seat was covered in juice.... 

:( Sadly I am unimpressed.."}
