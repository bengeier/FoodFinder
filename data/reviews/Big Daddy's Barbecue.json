{"text":"Was at comic-con this weekend and got a couple of chicken tacos for my wife. First off they were so tiny and not normal size tacos. Hardly any chicken in them. They were like the .99 cent ones you can get anywhere else and they charged $5 each.  Second, did not Check receipt till I got home and noticed they charged me 9.5% sales tax when the sales tax in Nevada is 8.25%.  Will not purchase anything from their google trucks again and everyone should stay away."}
{"text":"I am here at SEMA car show in Las Vegas Nevada. Ordered the brisket sandwich and it was dry and the bread was old and broke all apart. Asked the employee if I could get another one made because of the poor display and she said \"Yes\" \" for the same price as a new sandwich \" I will never come here when I visit Nevada again!"}
