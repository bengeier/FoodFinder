{"text":"Best margaritas around! The food is all a la cart, which is quite different from typical Mexican fair. Very unique flavors. The place is spotless inside with some nice artwork. Definitely a go-to if you like Mexican!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was pretty good, but a bit on the pricey side.  It would be nice if the meals came with a side such as rice, beans, or corn.  The booths were very weird and uncomfortable, I'll ask to sit at a table next time."}
{"text":"Our meals and drinks were delicious! The pickled veggies that came out with the chips and salsa were a unique touch. Our server was very courteous, and we loved the fun, clean atmosphere!

I was, however, a bit thrown off by the menu. Since quantities weren't listed for each type of taco, I figured they were all single servings. This was not the case, so I ended up leaving with plenty of tasty leftovers (which did reheat well). I'd suggest they add these details when the menu gets its next update.

Other than that, we have no complaints and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and have never had a bad meal. Once suggestion though, the tacos are kind of small so if you're hungry, I suggest getting 2-3. The burritos are amazing and a pretty good size!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and all of the food was great. I would recommend the El Mocho! Flavors were a bit salty but suited my taste. One in our group was gluten free and they had no problem with finding something. A bit on the pricy side for Mexican food but we will be going back. Only reason for 4 stars is that it was the first visit."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cool vibe, great food, friendly service, good prices. Well worth checking out."}
{"text":"Salsa is fantastic. Love the street corn and traditional gorditas. Kids loved it, too. Hope they revise the booth seating, the height and placement from table was awkward and uncomfortable. Will definitely return though!"}
{"text":"I had three of their street style tacos. Some of the best tacos I've had outside of California. Excellent quality meat, good seasoning, reasonable prices. The chips and salsa was also good for dine in service. Clean place with nice atmosphere. Worth the 10 minute drive from my hotel. I'll come back my next trip out for work."}
{"text":"While the food is very good and the servers are friendly, the wait for the food is ridiculously slow.  We went the first time about a month ago on a busy Saturday night, and we attributed the wait to that.  We just went again this week (a Wednesday night) and unfortunately had the same experience.  The restaurant was not that crowded, yet we waited almost an hour for our meals.  Tried to give it a second chance but just not worth it."}
{"text":"Sooo good.  My husband and I came here and were so pleased with how delicious everything was.  We love going out at Mexican restaurants, and we found a lot of special dishes on this menu that surpass the typical Mexican restaurant in Ohio.  

Our only initial  disappointment was that we mistakenly thought there was no bar in the restaurant, until we found an introvert's dream bar back behind the bathroom hallway. Intimate and lovely.

We will be back, and we'll be eating at the bar next time."}
{"text":"Delicious! Good service and fun atmosphere. Food is amazing.  Fresh ingredients. More than just the same old boring combo plates at the typical Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Monday night to check it out. Have heard excellent reviews from everyone that has been here. Walked in, Not crowded at all, so we got seated right away. The waiter brought us chips and salsa, (salsa is delicious!!) I ordered the Taquitos and a side of rice. It was so good. So many unique and different flavors that make El Taco Macho stand out among the other Mexican restaurants in the area. 

The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5, is the service was really slow. There were only 3 tables taken including ours, and it took forever for the Waiter to come around. Also, it was pretty warm in the restaurant. I think they needed to turn the air conditioner on. And also, it was loud. I wasn't sure if it was because the building is so tall or the rocks on the wall bouncing off sound. 

But, With all this being said, I would definitely go back. My father got the Street Corn and said it was THE BEST!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place 100 times and never even thought about stopping. I stopped for lunch today and was dramatically surprised. I had a burrito that had steak and shrimp in it and it was phenomenal as was the salsa with the chips they provided. I will definitely be back and highly recommend giving this place a chance. It is located in a strip mall so I am sure many people have no clue about it. Bravo!!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Texas so I wasn't expecting much from the Mexican food in Ohio. Saw the high reviews and figured it was worth a shot. They are a bit pricey compared to what I'm used to paying for similar quality food back in Texas, but the food itself was pretty good. Lots of traditional choices and your able to customize your food by picking what protein you want. It's more than just chicken or beef. I was surprised to see langua and chorizo on the menu this far north. Will be back again to try something different to see if the quality and taste hold up."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican in the neighborhood.  Love the authenticity. The tacos are amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Since moving to Ohio from Los Angeles a little over a year ago, this has been the absolute closest I have come to what I was used to back home. A little on the pricey side, but the food is excellent and the service is great. The restaurant is really nice and clean as well."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food my wife and i have had in a long time. Service is fast and friendly, food is amazing nothing like the typical mexican food you normally have around northeast ohio. Not refrided bean paste and that orange rice, everything is fresh and made to order. My family will defenitly be back again."}
{"text":"I am 44-years-old with 5 kids ages 22 thru 7, and even though I'm not a \"hipster\" by any stretch of the imagination, I still enjoy dining at trendy places but will not be back to this place. The food is a bit overpriced for what you get, and while some of the items had some heat to them, they were still lacking in flavor. (And for those reviews who say this is \"authentic\" Mexican... Yes, it's more authentic than Taco Bell, but in my opinion, it's not even close to authentic Mexican food you'll find in San Diego, CA or at taco shacks in Mexico.) Plus, the music was so loud it was impossible to have any sort of dinner conversation that was more than 3-4 over-enunciated so they could read my lips because there was no way they were going to hear my voice! After reading other reviews, I was very excited to try this place, but I left feeling so disappointed. On a positive note, there were some girls sitting next to us who were enjoying some cocktails & they looked REALLY good... But that could just be because I'm 44-years-old and have 5 kids! Every cocktail looks yummy to me!"}
{"text":"I went you're with my best friend the food was excellent but I felt it was overpriced or slightly higher than other Mexican restaurants. I usually go to Compadres in Painesville. The fajita quesadilla was good here but too expensive and I felt Compadres was still better the vegetables in my heater quesadilla at this place weren't as crunchy and El Dante more like they had been sitting already pre-cooked but it was so good. The thing I like the most was the salsa I thought it was 100% awesome. Our server was also very attentive. Only thing I didn't care for is how open the floor plan is you are basically staring at everybody forget about there being any privacy so if it's your idea to go on a date night this is not the place."}
{"text":"Great food!!! We had the fish tacos and the nachos. Both were awesome! The salsa is delicious as well. We went on a Friday night at 7pm and it was crowded but service was great and food came quickly , served hot and fresh. They offer a great menu with so much to choose from. The drink and beer list is great. All employees were friendly and wore smiles on their faces. Our new favorite place!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Mexican food. And have always loved the spiciness and the meat chunks of the tacos. Tacos have always been my comfort food.

But this place has not really worked for me. Though, I don't have anything thing against this restaurant but the food is nothing special. Also the flavors are either too loud or they just flat bland.

Also service and the interior is nothing special. The staff does not make an effort to serve and on the food. 

I would not come to this place out of my way but if in the neighborhood I'd drop by if have no other option."}
{"text":"Amazing & real great! Little light on  portions but the quality of the Mexican street food make up for the little protions"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Came with the kids, both ate their meals with gusto. Very fresh and full of flavor. I'll be back.  :)  We had quesadillas and shrimp tacos. Shrimp taco had lots of spice but lots of flavor!  I also really enjoy the little relish dish with the pickled cabbage and carrot. Crispy and tart."}
{"text":"This place does the most beautifully plated street
 food ever! We have been here twice and were just blown away by the food! We are kinda spoiled having El Senior so close by, so I was skeptical about El Taco Macho. 
Unlike some Yelpers, we have not experienced any trouble getting drinks. They do flavored Margaritas specials and they are big and yummy. 
Both the food and service here are top notch. Complimentary warm tortilla chips with salsa & pickled veggies are all you can eat! We've had tacos,burritos, quesadillas, guacamole, fajitas and every single dish is authentic and beautiful and delish! And, they make their tortillas from scratch!!
Do not be fooled by the fact that it is in a strip mall! The decor is really kinda cool and upscale and the booths are wide enough for at least 3 people on each side. We are really happy to have this little gem."}
{"text":"Love this place! Unique menu inspired by Mexican street food vendors. I tried the vegetable burrito and it was fantastic. Peppers, broccoli, zucchini, rice and beans -  not runny. Please note menu items are not like other \"Tex-mex\" restaurants. Also great presentation and upbeat Mexican contemporary music. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I need to start by saying I am a very picky eater, in the sense that if food isn't cooked exactly as I want it, I won't eat it. This is my go to place when we don't know what to do for dinner, or need a drink after a long day. The food is great, the service is great, and you can't beat the price. My boyfriend and I go here at least once a week. I will say, this is Mexican street food, so don't expect your typical retried beans and rice, but each time I'm more and more impressed by the food I get. (Although my favorite thing here is the carnitas, it's incredible.) The staff is super friendly, everyone greets you as you walk in. We've sat in the dining area a few times, but mostly choose to sit back in the bar area, where it's more relaxing. My only problem is the ever \"lets go for one drink\" which turns into staying for hours because we get lost in conversation with the bartenders. I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"I think the high Yelp reviews give people false expectations for this restaurant: it is simply a different spin on tex-mex. Average at best. Service was friendly but slow. Prices are a a bit high. Margs were delicious, chips and salsa were great. They provide pickled veggies with the chips and salsa as well, kind of neat.

Ordered queso fundito to start and it came out cold with the cheese already hardened. To give you an idea of the consistency, I couldn't scoop any of it with our chips - too hard and stringy, chips just crumbled. Not the kind of queso I'm used to. It was either under-cooked or waited too long to be brought to our table. But, of course, when my burrito came out it was piping hot. No complaints other than the temperature on my main meal - it was very tasty. 

Just be forewarned, it's not all that some fellow Yelpers make it out to be. There are much better choices for Mexican in the Mentor-area."}
{"text":"This would be my favorite restaurant if it weren't 30 miles away.  Great food, friendly service."}
{"text":"Most awesome Mexican restaurant around!! Real Mexican food. You cannot go wrong here. Great prices! I will tell you that the wait for your food is a little wait but it is worth every bite!! This is a real hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Very cute. Nice decor. Bigger than I thought. Although portions aren't huge they are quality and extremely tasty. Always looking for good Mexican but not a lot of good quality ones around us. Reminds me of a place I would find in Ohio city or Tremont. Hidden gem"}
{"text":"Food absolutely does not travel well or at least it didn't for us. We got a variety of things like the street corn that my husband liked it a lot reheated but I could not eat my food at all the day I got it. I got a quesadilla and tacos the tacos became a complete soggy mess and fell apart and were tasteless. The quesadilla became a weird soggy yet spongy mess I couldn't even get through two bites I kept spitting it out because it felt like I was chewing on a sponge. We are very hopeful to try it sitting down at the restaurant and giving it another go. Oh! Major highlight their chips are absolutely fantastic they were so good I ate them plain so we will be trying this place again."}
{"text":"We've heard a lot about this place and have been twice so far. Our first experience we went with some friends, no kids, and we're sat pretty quickly.  Naturally they bring us some chips and salsa which is pretty standard.  The place was super busy and from all the chatter it seemed rightly so.   

It seemed like the trendiness wore off pretty quickly as our server showed up after passing us around 8 times.  Maybe she was unaware we were in her section...however it took around 15 minutes to get our drinks.  Why does this always happen to me and not any of the other yelpers who gave this place 5 starts?  She apologized as I think she maybe was a little scatter brained that day but the place was not that busy as we were there post rush hour and it seemed like she had something else going on.   Any way the chips and salsa kept coming...but it took an act of congress to get a second round of drinks.  Eventually she yielded and took our orders.   My burrito was large and in charge; however it was not as fast as I thought it'd be (around 20 minutes) but it was hot, nonetheless.  It seemed like our order was either forgotten or entered in very late.

As we were there around an hour at least she brought some cinnamon things to say sorry which was a nice gesture.   However one wants your dinner to be an experience, not an apology.

I have been back since with my family and our experience was the same.  Pretty darn good food, better Mexican food than anywhere else we've been but the service just was not up to par. 

Side note that all the outlets are at head level and have usb charger ports on them, which is nice. 

Overall 3 stars."}
{"text":"Food is good but you need to be careful as you order.

I've gone in at least once a week all year long to order the same $10 lunch order of steak fajitas.  I am as regular of a customer as they come.

Today I was shocked to get a $15 bill for the same order.  Apparently I was \"upgraded\" to the dinner portion by the waitress who didn't care to clarify that there are two options on the menu.  The more expensive edition comes out on a sizzling hot plate, but the portions are otherwise the same.  Apparently I was charged an additional $5 for the extra dirty dish that I didn't ask for.

Really unhappy with the 50% surchage on my bill today.  

I'll be taking a time out from El Taco Macho for now."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time. Getting food to go. Very nice decor and nice big roomy tables.  Will definitely stop back and stay for dinner if the food is good."}
{"text":"This place has awesome Michoacán Tacos!  It's hard to find a restaurant in the MidWest with great guacamole but these guys nailed it.  Try the street corn if you have never had it, absolutely the best way to serve corn."}
{"text":"Beyond fresh. Beyond authentic. Truly exceptional food and drinks. You know a place is authentic when they actually have a paloma on the drink menu. I can't tell you how many times I have asked for that drink at other 'americanized' Mexican restaurants and they couldn't make one or even heard of one. The paloma here is a little different than a traditional one, but is really good. What a great start to what became a perfect meal. Salsas and guacamole were bursting with fresh flavors. Baha fish tacos were flawless and quesadilla El pastor was refreshingly not drowning in queso. Great service, timed perfectly. Can't wait to come back. The cozy little bar in back is a hiding spot that can't be beat."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent--tremendous food (started off with great chips) off a menu with pretty solid variety and good pricing, and good environment for lunch or eating with a big group at nicely separated booths."}
{"text":"Much better second time around.  Will come again.  Food fresh. Service good.   Margaritas are good and many vegetarian options."}
{"text":"We just happened upon this place by chance. It looked like a while in the wall pace but it turned out to be industrial cool. The chips were good with the marinated veggies.... different and yummy. I ordered pablamo tacos which were so good! Throw in a margarita and it was a good dinner."}
{"text":"REAL MEXICAN. THIS IS NOT YOUR TACO BELL STAND.  This place serves real Mexican street food along with traditional Mexican. The staff is friendly and will explain the menu. The owner is thanking the patrons and following up on request. The margaritas are strong so be sure to uber or have a DD. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was very good glad to see Mexican that's just doesn't smother in cheese and  add refried  Beens. Booths are not comfortable at all, the  table is to far away and bench is very narrow. We asked to move to a table and they were fine with us doing so. Want to try the street corn on next visit heard it is amazing.  Menu is not super big but they sure do it well. I like that they not only put out a very tasty product but worry about presentation also. Do not hesitate if you are on the fence."}
{"text":"New Mexican restaurant in Painesville. Don't let the location fool you, it's tucked away in a shopping center. Great decor and atmosphere, when you walk in you it's like your in a restaurant downtown. I asked my server to give me a suggestion, and I'm glad I took it. I can't remember the name of thee dish, but it was similar to a flatbread, but instead of the bread, it was a large tortilla loaded with crispy pork, fresh veggies and cheese. I'll definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Better and cleaner than any other Mexican restaurants in the area. Food was great. Atmosphere clean modern angry. Prices were wonderful. Drinks were strong. Didn't leave a feeling I got ripped off like we so often do at El Rodeo. They don't try to nickel and dime you here. I would highly recommend. Period"}
{"text":"They have things on the menu I have not seen at other Mexican restaurants, but the serving sizes were small and for the amount of food we got it was expensive.

Party of two seniors - both women - having lunch - sharing 3 different dishes."}
{"text":"Loved the lunch options... food is of exceptional quality and beautiful presentation! Staff is courteous and attentive. Atmosphere is very clean, very trendy and modern! Haven't tried the dinner options but we loved our first experience so much we will be back. Lunch fajitas were amazing!"}
{"text":"Overall so delicious! Housemade chips are perfection. The guacamole is good, though definitely has crema mixed in, which I'd like to do without. 
The black beans and poblano rice are absolutely killer. I ordered the Latin Lover Shrimp. Though the sauce was supposed to be spicy, it wasn't in the least. Perfectly cooked shrimp, though the mushrooms were inedible because of the overwhelming smoke. 
Will most definitely be returning! I'm hoping that they'll fix the seating... far too high for the table height, and generally just uncomfortable."}
{"text":"What a little hidden gem! This place makes authentic Mexican street food and is tucked in a shopping strip. The restaurant upon entering is minimalistic modern industrial with high backed booths. It was clean looking. We were greeted immediately and when we asked if there was a bar, we were directed to a hall in the back of the restaurant. We walked past the open kitchen and the bathrooms to find a second little room with a small, but full service, bar and three high top tables and a couple TVs. Signage said you needed to be 21 to sit back in this space. 

The staff person put on the ball game for us and gave us menus and complimentary chips and salsa. The chips and the salsa were delicious. He was very happy to wait on us. There was a large tequila selection and menu of margaritas. The beers on tap were mainly from Mexico including corona. The liquor selection was vast with several flavors of each. They could probably make about anything you've ever had. The menu wasn't large, but it all sounded very good. 

We tried a couple of the tacos. Both were made with very fresh ingredients. They even gave you a cup of pickled cabbage! I've never had a Mexican restaurant in the U.S. offer that condiment. The tacos were both very good. Everything tastes made in house. They were authentic and served without cheese. I don't like Mexican restaurants that serve everything smothered in melted cheese and floating in a swamp of liquefied beans. I can't wait to go back and try more things like the street corn, the chorizo queso dip and maybe even the beef tongue, Ha!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite, authentic tacos, the veggies with the chips, the atmosphere. Full service bar...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great South of the border inspired dishes done in an inovative and modern way. Great fun decor, spotlessly clean, and great food at great prices...
These owners know what they are doing and you need to try it."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always make a stop here when I'm in Mentor, everything is good and fairly priced, staff is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was and the variety. My husband doesn't eat meat and they had some great options for him. The drinks were good. The only reason for the 4 star rating is even though it wasn't busy the service was a little slow and we had empty glasses on our table for a while. The service was friendly though and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. Great beer selection and large margs. Tacos were small so it was recommended to order two. The location is not ideal."}
{"text":"If I was a meat eater my review may be higher so keep that in mind. 

Very limited options on the menu for vegetarians and vegans. I wasn't overly impressed with my food. I ordered two veggie tacos for $5. They we tiny but full of lightly grilled peppers, broccoli, onion, and squash. They lacked any real seasoning. I also ordered black beans and those came out with cheese on top after I asked about cheese being in either dish. 

Service was minimal at best, no water refill, empty salsa container and no thanks for coming or have a nice day when I paid and left. 

I was passing though and this sounded like a good spot. I would personally go somewhere else next time I'm over this way. 

Overall Meh."}
{"text":"We have our favorite Mexican place, but this came highly recommended. I am not a very big burrito fan, but after tasting my husbands - we went back the next day (yes it's that good!) to try one. Cheese dip great, service great and food is very fresh. Cute bar in the back. This place is a keeper if word gets out. Too bad they aren't in the Concord area - would be a big seller. 

My only negative is the seating. The few main booths in the front might be the most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat in. Someone definitely messed up the dimensions :( 
Didn't stop us from coming back, but we asked for a table the second time. :)"}
{"text":"Shoulda been called El Macho Taco, but that's my personal opinion. Drinks are strong. Tacos are small. Fajitas are dope."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Lake County, if not Northeast Ohio besides Momocho. The guacamole is so fresh, it tastes like they make it right before it came to the table. The food is delicious, not heavy or oily like most places. Dishes are seasoned nicely. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My Husband, 2yr old and I dined here for dinner on a whim; I read some of these great Yelp reviews and wanted to check it out! We were able to get seated right away at 6:30pm on a Friday. Upon walking in we were hit with super warm heat...I'm not sure if the AC wasn't working or if it's always that hot, but it was super warm. The ceiling fans helped a little, but once we were finished dining and walked outside, the 80 degree weather felt amazingggg. Anyway,  we sat at a long narrow table, with a narrow bench on one side. Not the most comfortable seating in the world, but we made do! 

We were brought chips, salsa and some pickled veggies right away. The chips and salsa were pretty standard, but the veggies were great. Definitely something unique! I ordered the Frito burrito with veggies and my husband got a chicken burrito. Nothing crazy; we both liked ours. Wasn't anything spectacular. Mine was kind of dry and had a very light drizzle of crema, so I asked for a side of sour cream ($1.50). I was brought the wrong beverage as well, but it was fixed fairly quick. My daughter liked her French fries and chicken nuggets  

We will definitely come back and give it another go!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and modern but very loud. The music volume made it hard to have a conversation.  Salsa is too hot.  I had the tacos carbon and the chicken was seasoned terribly.  So disappointed based on the Mentor paper's glowing review."}
{"text":"3rd visit to El Taco Macho today. The food and service have been amazing all three times! Must try the place. Beautiful atmosphere. Quaint bar area. Drink specials!"}
{"text":"Great street style Mexican food. Food,drinks and service were terrific. Will go back often to go through he menu. Don't miss the tamales. Went on a Monday which we usually avoid. Two more points about this place, is that any nearby staff whether they're your server or not are very quick to help you out with any needs. El Taco Macho is neither Tex-Mex or pricey."}
{"text":"Very good
My wife tried shrimp taco and she liked it , came with guacamole sauce
She also got A sangria Margarita
I tried the two cheese chicken quesadilla was also good served salsa  and chips before

Different from the rice, refined bean plates in other Mexican restaurants

The Arroz con Polloia also good"}
{"text":"What a great little place! I have been here a few times and the service and food has always been great. Not your typical Mexican restaurant for sure. The food always looks good and they have a knack for presentation. The only downside I see is the location.It is located in the plaza next to Marc's in Painsville...so be on the look out for it. It is well worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Come here.... just get over here and you'll realize quickly what a wonderful decision you've made.  Service.... A+.  Atmosphere.... A++.  Food.... A++++++.  

  This place blows Barrio out of the water.  I lived on the Mexican border and had authentic Mexican cuisine... And this is a place where you'll find the perfect balance between authentic Mexican and 'tex-mex' (American mexican).  

  Lastly, make sure to try the chorizo.... hands down best chorizo I've had.   Not dry... not to fatty... not to hot... jusssssst right."}
{"text":"My family and I were so excited to have a Taqueria near us! We were not disappointed! El taco macho boasts authentic Mexican street food and they meant it! Reasonable prices and real Mexican food! We loved it."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly! The food is amazing not like all the Mexican places we have around and are used to.  Everything is so fresh."}
{"text":"Finally.... an authentic Mexican place, not Mexican American. Everything is made fresh in front of your eyes and doesn't fall short of tasty. Inexpensive and worth the drive from wherever you are coming from. PSA: only place I have found (I am from CLE) that has street corn!!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here - the staff is so nice and thoughtful, the food (especially the poblano tacos) is fresh, delicious, and not your standard American Tex mex stuff. The Paloma cocktail is awesome and they have a great range of tequila. Don't miss the queso dip."}
{"text":"Small place in a strip mall but excellent food. Had the Camaron Enchillado (shrimp tacos).  They had a bit of spice but they were cooked just right and very good. Looking forward to coming back next time I'm in the area. Note the meal includes three tacos. I ate one before realizing these were so good I had to write a review."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place is only two miles from my house. This isn't your run of the mill Mexican place. Think closer to \"Barrio\" than a \"Don Tequila's\". Cool decor (except didn't understand all the soft drinks in front of store). If you get the tacos think more tapas style. Not a huge portion but the flavors are there. If you want a big portion get a burrito. My wife is vegetarian and she said her veggie burrito was the best she's ever had. Not mushy veggies in a mushy tortilla like most places. My camaron enchilada was well seasoned, fresh, and delicious. Big open, clean kitchen. Little hidden bar in back. even the chips and salsa with pickled veggies were a step above. Street corn delicious. Good service, not fast but we weren't in a rush. Only draw back was we had to go straight home because our clothes smelled like we had been working in the kitchen there all day. Need some ventilation and you would totally forget you're in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Small but nice place with a slightly different spin on Mexican food. Their margaritas are quite tasty. I ordered the tamales as an appetizer and was a little disappointed in how dry they were. Great salsa and endless chips and the marinated veggies help make the Margaritas go down even quicker!"}
{"text":"Good service great food, definitely will be going back. Loved the Mexican street corn and tamales."}
{"text":"was excited at the Nacho Libre decor. Unfortunately, Every item that indicates HOT are not. The only interesting thing about their guacosalsa was finding a piece of jalapeño. I'm pretty sure the verde and salsa they charge you $1.50 for each, is simply jarred store bought Hernandez salsa. Service was very slow! Chips were good, but everything is flavorless. Booth tables are tiny - ask for an apron or lots of napkins.

Oh yea, the Street corn was yummy."}
{"text":"Fantastic, super fresh, great flavors.  
We stopped in at lunch time with the kids - there's a kids menu which makes it an ideal stop for families.  Chips and salsa were brought right over to munch while looking over the menu.
The burrito serving is huge, the street tacos are the perfect size for trying two.
There are 9 fresh salsas to choose from, and a sampler of 5 is 4.99 with chips.
Meat choices- Carne asada, al pastor, chorizo, lengua, carnitas and tinga.  The veggie option is grilled mushrooms, red onions, broccoli, red and green peppers and zucchini.
Drinks are the basic Pepsi choices, but also a large selection of Jarritos by the bottle.  
My daughter chose her favorite drink- horchata, a cinnamon rice milk.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"We sat in the bar, because they were packed at 8 on a Friday night.  Food was excellent, and portions were huge.  The chips and salsa were homemade, and the pickled veggies were a nice surprise. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I stopped at this place on a Saturday night for dinner ! It is located inside a plaza. The dining area was very inviting and cozy but I decided to sit by the bar which is in the further back and rather small. The chips were brought out with salsa and also pickled cabbage! The chips were so different than anything I have ever had. Usually chips are just plain in most Mexican restaurant but this chips were seasoned and flavored . One of my favorite chips I have had in a Mexican restaurant. I started off with traditional margarita which was very good and good price for it ! For dinner I got al pastor burrito and their spicy shrimp dish. The food presentation was excellent but the flavor in the food was beyond amazing! Everything was seasoned flavored so tastefully. The bartenders were very nice and friendly. The atmosphere was very cozy and the food is excellent. One of my favorite Mexican restaurant! I will surely be back to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Always in the look out for good Mexican food in our area (Mentor), we are now in luck! Based on the recommendations of our chef son (and a Father's Day gift certificate from his family) why not on a lazy Sunday evening.

First was our chips, salsa and a bowl of pickled cabbage and carrots.  Both were tasty and a good start for the meal. 

Linda ordered the quesadilla with Al Pastor (marinated pork). I got a variety of tacos; shrimp, tinga (chicken), beef, and Al Pastor. 

Plates were served and the presentation was that of a top flight restaurant, but not expected at a strip mall location. 

The dishes were FANTASTIC! Linda said the corn tortilla was the best ever and a sample bite proved it!  My four tacos were some of the best ever!  No skimping on the meats. Each taco was served on two soft shells. With the meats, those four tacos could easily become 8! Anyway, the shrimp was spicy and went well with their quacsalsa. Al patron was wonderful!  The other two,  well there is tomorrow! 

Five stars and it could be six!  Wonderful surprise in Mentor/Painesville area, and worthy of a trip!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican street food. If you're ever in the Mexican mood go here. I promise you will not be disappointed.  The El Macho burrito is to die for and make sure to wash it down with a hand shaken margarita made by the amazing Maria at the back bar"}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Definitely comparable to some authentic taco places. Just wish they have more meat options for taco."}
{"text":"The décor in this place is amazing. Old school wrestling masks on the walls. Very modern feel inside as opposed to the old looking plaza it is located in. The food is great. I am not too well versed on what is or isn't \"authentic Mexican food,\" but I would venture to say this is pretty close to authentic. There is a side of pickled cabbage that comes with the chips as a salsa substitute. You still get the salsa, but it comes as an alternative, and it's a pretty good alternative. The food is well flavored, and the presentation is on the up and up as well. Even my gordita looked perfectly designed on my plate. The only confusing piece is why an authentic Mexican restaurant has a pepperoni pizza quesadilla on the menu... but even that sounds pretty good though right?"}
