{"text":"After wandering aimlessly looking for a place to eat after a matinee, we stopped here at the recommendation of a resident. None of us were overly impressed.  I ordered the Mediterranean seafood pasta. I thought the scallops were really good, but the rest of the dish was lacking flavor. My mom had the rib-eye and my brother and his girlfriend had the filet, and all of them commented that the meat was too peppery (my mom did say that the goat cheese whipped potatoes were great). My husband had the lamb shank and he said it wasn't anything special. I tasted the rosemary polenta that came with it and it was disgusting...waaaaaaay too much rosemary. The waiter didn't seem too excited to be there, but the man who served us bread and refilled our waters was very pleasant.  Overall, I was disappointed. We did not spend an exorbitant amount of money since we did not order drinks, appetizers, or dessert, but we did spend enough that I would've expected a higher quality meal. I can't say that any of us are itching to go back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!!! Service is slow !!! The servers at least tried and were appologetic which is more than I can say for the Owner Alex !!! HE WAS RUDE !!!! Despite the fact we called ahead the night before....and explained we were going to head to playhouse square after for a show and they assured us 2hours is plenty of time to eat and head out. The food took over an 1 1/2 hrs to show up....seriously some people ordered a salad....its not that serious. ALEX THE RUDE OWNER..was cold and nasty. Didnt care at all...actually he made a remark if u wanted to be in and out in 2 hours we should have ordered soup and salad..  REALLY????? When called out on the fact that this isnt the way a business is run and how a MAN shouldnt be so rude to a group of women..he would stare blank faced. They ran out of cups so most of us didnt get a drink....WHAT KIND OF PLACE RINS OUT OF CUPS. ...they werent even busy....the bread they served was FROZEN !!!!! ARE U KIDDING ME !!! From start to finish everything was wrong.....the worst was when one of our froenss ordered her meal at 6 ....and it didnt come until 7:50...she didnt eat because we had to make it to the show. The owner didnt even care.......when bill time came we should have all walked out and not paid anything. Esp after the bills were wrong...I was charged to 2 cokes.......when I only had water !!! DO NOT EAT HERE !!!!! *THE 1Star is because the waiters (although slow) did seem to try*"}
{"text":"After seeing Mamma Mia we had dinner at Alex Bistro and Bar for the first time.   Love the open decor and patio.  Food is unique and exceptional! The mussels were the best I have ever had. My friend had the succulent pan seared quail, and I had exquisitely seasoned lamb.  The lavender mojitos are to die for.  Servers were well trained, and very helpful.  A great new addition to the theater district! Cannot believe it has been open for only three weeks! I plan to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Major temperature issues.  I ordered the lamb shank and unfortunately it was cold.  Of course this messed up the timing of the dinner and my partner finished his scallop dish (just slightly warm) before I was able to get another lamb shank.   The second shank was just a tad warmer...still not really hot.  Also, the spinach and polenta were cold.  Unfortunately, we had a show to go to, so I just ate some of it and called it a night.  I'm not sure who is running the kitchen, but they have horrible quality control.  The waitress was nice about it.  This was obviously a kitchen issue.  I do understand that you have a lot of customers who have the same curtain time for a show, but I think everyone wants their food at the proper temperature.  With Cowell & Hubbard and (now) District in the theatre district, Alex Bistro has to improve if they want to compete."}
{"text":"We happened upon this new restaurant on our recent trip to downtown. We were pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful new look to the space once occupied by the Hanna restaurant where we ate last summer. Menu is eclectic Mediterranean. Open only a week, things seemed to run well. We were glad we could eat outside. My salmon wrapped in grape leaves was very good, I didn't mind it being cooked medium, but most folks probably will not. My husband's red snapper was perfect. The waiter suggested the olive oil cake for dessert.....I was a bit hesitant...but very delighted every bite. Glad to have a new choice when seeing a show. 5 stars for only being open a week. we will be back."}
{"text":"Alex Bistro is a little work-horse of a place in the heart of Playhouse Square.   I come here regularly for fairly-priced meals and generally good service.   It's not a \"WOW\" place, but it's reliable and tasty.  Recommended?   The grilled Romaine salad, Risotto (usually a winter special) and their steaks."}
{"text":"I live downtown in playhouse square and I'm always looking for new places to eat.  I noticed that the old Hanna restaurant had changed hands to become Alex Bistro a few weeks ago and finally found time to stop in for a drink.  The drinks are  great; I had a Moscow Mule made with no added sugars and my beau had a beer.  We ordered the lamb meatballs which were good but my favorite was the cheese and bread platter.  There were at least 7 different cheeses, olive tapenade, berries, and 2 different bread options.  More than enough for 2 and at $9 it's a great deal. The server mentioned that they are working on a signature bloody mary and let us sample the spicy garlic infused vodka and it was outstanding.  I can't wait to go back and try the final drink. I am also looking forward to trying out breakfast on weekday mornings. I give this place all 5 stars and really hope they decide to open on Sunday's for breakfast because we could use a nice brunch spot on this side of town."}
{"text":"We went to the Bistro before a play, and enjoyed it very much.  I had the duck breast salad, which was well prepared and tasty.  My wife had the rib eye, and our friend had the seafood pasta.  Both enjoyed their dishes.  The service was attentive, and the location perfect for the playhouse.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks after a show at Playhouse Square.  Fine place for drinks, but I cannot speak to its food menu.  The bar area is small bu there is an upstairs loft that has more seating.  There is a flat-screen TV at the bar, but this is not a place for sports watching.  Perfect for before or after a show though."}
{"text":"Well... I am a bit torn.  The food was excellent, our server was \"trying\" but the meal was almost a complete train wreck.  It took over an hour to get our \"entrees\" and all we ordered was appetizers (Except one entree).  The owner is such a control freak that only \"he\" can validate the parking ticket and that delayed us another 20 minutes with us just standing at the door trying to leave.   We weren't the only frustrated diner.  Good food, very poor execution."}
{"text":"Located in the playhouse district, this is a great weekday lunch option since there aren't too many in the area. Burgers and wraps are always good.  On my most recent visit, I ordered an omelet which was WAY too greasy. You can order some of the breakfast items for lunch.  I would have sent it back but was in a bit of a rush.  Hoping that it was just an off day in the kitchen since I've always had good food here otherwise.  Also, there service is great.  Wait staff has always been very kind and prompt.  Very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you want to make a show. It took an hour for us to get our meal.  When we asked about our food the waitress said it was coming up and they just needed food runners. Five minutes later, and less than half an hour to show time we asked again and the waitress was extremeley rude. She told us it was because we were a large group and walked away while my mother was in mid sentence. When the food arrived the owner was standing nearbye. I motioned for him and mentioned the hour wait. He told us that it was our fault because we ordered appetizers, which came out 45 minutes before the food. Clearly this is not a place to go with a large group, and certainly don't make the mistake of ordering an appetizer - how dare we?  Both the waitress and owner told us the there was an entrance on Euclid and it would only take two minutes.  Of course this would mean we would need to jaywalk!  So they care as little about their guests safety as they do their time. To make matters worse, two dishes were overcharged."}
{"text":"The gf and I came here before a show at phs. I'm glad I didn't read the angry reviews before we came. We spent a very pleasant hour at the bar before the show. We had  crab and chevre spinach spanakopitas and zucchini fritters apps. I had a couple of dog fish head ipas and the gf had two leiny berryweiss. Total bill $33. Not bad for the theater district. Our bartender was a sweetheart. She was attentive without being obtrusive. She didn't interrupt our conversations but would ask if we had everything we needed. We will definitely return before our next theater show."}
{"text":"Had reservations, got sat right away then things went bad. No one came to the table, had to ask for service which still took awhile.  Finally ordered. Got food but still no drinks or bread. Had to ask to get drinks and bread. Finally got drinks half way through our meals - REALLY!! but no bread.  Spoke to owner Alex who said he was sorry and would get bread for us.  He didn't return.  It was really weird and the owner seemed disinterested. He stated they had a lot of walk-ins due to the State Theatre event.  Of course they did, that is where they are located. This shouldn't be a new thing for them to figure out.  We had reservations - actually planned to dine there. Neglect the walk-ins if needed - explain to them that you are very busy and service will be awful. Oh, Got bread with the check finally.  Owner returned as we were leaving with a smile on his face asking how everything went.  We just shook our heads in disbelief."}
{"text":"I decided to venture over here for lunch, mainly due to process of elimination considering the lack of decent choices within a block of my work.  I ordered some sort of chicken sandwich that was definitely not chicken.  As the texture of this rubber substance hit the back of my throat, it was dry-heaved directly into the trash.  My dog has toys with a texture closer to that of chicken.  If I was at Horseshoe, I would put all my chips on \"NOT chicken\", seriously, what was was up with that!?  One evening after a long work day, I needed food ASAP so I called in a carryout order for a burger.  Chapter 1 from \"you know your restaurant is failing\" reads, \"when the server:customer ratio is 2:1 on a Friday evening\".  I was greeted by a server who giggled, \"I'll be right with you!\" from the shoulders of another server giving her a piggyback ride around the restaurant to the ladies room, from which they never emerged.  As I was waiting for the burger I called in, some oaf from the kitchen started griping \"tell him to chill out!  burgers take time to cook! if he wants one now tell him to go to burger king\".  Anyone with less class or self-control would've administered a much-deserved punch to the face. There is no way on earth I would set foot back in anywhere that I hear a staff disrespecting me when I'm standing there patiently with my mouth shut waiting for an 9 dollar burger that was served bright pink in the middle and missing bacon (most likely out of spite)."}
{"text":"very good food. interesting menu.  quickly served for theater goers. OK wait staff. Excellent water server. I suspect the poor reviews are put up by the competition.  It was quite good. only thing is it is noisy!  Get a reservation"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed Alex's Bistro last night before the show. We had a wonderful time. The food and service was Excellent. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Regarding BREAKFAST: This place is in a great location and the venue is huge. There is a patio option for warmer weather. They have a huge range of hours (7a-10p on most days) which makes it a good place for about any meal before or after any number of activities. There is street parking in front and lots of garages nearby or you can walk from work or take the newly extended free downtown trolley service which has a spot nearby on Euclid. As for the food it was just okay, nothing to write home about, but not bad either. Being a Middle Eastern restaurant there was some unique fare on the menu such as the Shawarma omelet that I ordered. It came with real potato wedges and a choice of toast. The Bacon, Egg and Cheese Pita looked okay, but there was a big end of it that was just Pita. I look forward to trying my favourite Middle Eastern dinner items here and comparing them to other Middle Eastern eateries. I hope this place, \"Est. 2012\" as the carpet in the entrance way proudly announces, does well. I have a feeling being open so many hours and having to \"specialise\" in some many menu items might hurt them a bit."}
