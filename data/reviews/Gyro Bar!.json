{"text":"Went here for lunch today, this may be the best gyro that I've had in the city. I love that they put fries in the pita and everything is very fresh. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place might be nice and clean but lacks any real flavour. They are called gyro bar, no lamb gyros! Wtf?! Just chicken and pork, which but look more like shawarma than a gyro. The menu is a tiny piece of paper that is tacted to a wall that's half in the kitchen, making it hard to read.  Who puts fries on a gyro? I was looked at like a crazy person for asking for no fries! People may like fries doesn't mean I want them on my sandwich.  All of the other people commenting are probably friends and family if they think this place is any good. Or have lived under a rock their entire lives.  Each ingredient should have enough flavour that it's hard to eat on its own, but when they come together they all sing. Maybe try some restaurants other than fast food and you would have a gold mine in the Westend. But hey, don't listen to someone that has spent their lives in the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"A new fave for me, certainly the best fast food I know on the city's western side.  My first trip here about ten days ago was so awesome I had to come back...visit 2 is better.   As mentioned elsewhere the fries make the Gyros next level, ample onions, tzatziki and tomatoes that actually look like...wait for it....Tomatoes! The meat is flavourful (have done chicken and beef so far)and tender and when wrapped together in a pita cone you get a de-fricking-licious meal at a VERY VERY reasonable price.  Oh...the staff are also extremely friendly and helpful, give this place a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since they opened and the food has been good.   I must admit, when I first walked in I thought it was going to be horrible. They don't have a proper menu up above the counter but paper takeaway menus that you can look at. I can't see them succeeding if you can't at least get a glance at what's on the menu from the outside.   I've had both the pork and chicken gyros and I've liked them. I've never had the fries on the wrap in the past but I dug it. The wrap is a pretty big portion and that with a side order of fries is about $10. Not bad for a full meal (minus a drink).   I do wish they would put up a proper menu and maybe have a wrap with fries and drink combo though. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Interior is nothing special, most important, great souvlaki dinner, chicken cooked nicely, great potatoes and rice."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a number of times. The Pork Gyro wrap is one of the best Gyros in the city of Toronto. I really like the addition of French fries to the wrap and the pork is incredibleCheck this place out soon!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Gyro Bar! Souvlaki Kitchen.  It's been open since September and on my radar for a couple of weeks (an Eggsmart used to be there).  It's not a fancy place but it's comfortable.  I ordered a chicken souvlaki dinner without salad.  It was really good.  The chicken was freshly cooked just for me and tender.  The potatoes were lemony and oily.  The rice was plump and tasty.  The pita bread was warm.  The tzatziki was refreshing and cool.  I was given two ... I used one and took the other home.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad, Gyro Bar, not bad at all...  Full disclosure, I have not stepped foot in this place, but rather had it brought to my couch courtesy of UberEats. I got a chicken wrap and a pork wrap and they were both stuffed with delicious sauce and french fries. Whaaaaat? Delicious."}
{"text":"for the area, this place is awesome.  I do miss that eggsmart was here...full disclosure, and was a bit heartbroken when it closed down, but was a bit excited when it became this gyro place!  was able to swing by for some late night dinner here, mainly on the fact that I was craving shawarma/gyros!  I walked into to a very bright and colorful location, with a lot of great smells in the air. was greeted almost within my first step into this place. I placed my order and was told because I ordered lamb that it was 10-15 minute wait for it to be cooked. I responded with that it was fine and I was willing to wait for it. 12 minutes went by and I was asked to come up and pick my toppings for the wraps that I got, unfortunately for me, my mind said \"everything\" everything is a great option but this place is heavy handed with the onions which was bad for me, and even worse for everyone on the bus ride back to my apartment...LOL.  great flavors and great service, with great hours, just stay away from the heavy handed onions.  transit options are the 501 queen streetcar/bus and the 504 king streetcars, parking options are on the streets only, with a couple of lots being down a ways.  definitely worth grabbing food from here, especially when waiting for a transfer with the TTC.  I will be back!"}
