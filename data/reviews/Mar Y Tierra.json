{"text":"Out of the way place that serves fresh flavorful food. The service is great and you can tell this is an authentic restaurant with pride of ownership. The chips were still warm from the oven and set the tone for the whole meal. My wife's fish tacos and my beef enchiladas were all amazing. The sauces were flavorful without being overly spicy. The guacamole was fresh and fabulous. The food is top quality and the preparation is perfect and for the price they are charging it is an amazing bargain.   The comment from a reviewer that the place is a \"hole-in-the-wall\" is ridiculous. The decor is just fine and simple. Not campy like too many Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome. Food is great, lunches are busy but you always get your food fast and friendly service every time I come in. I've been here for dinner and i guess a lot of people don't know that they are open but people I'm here to let you know that the margaritas are awesome. I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"great stuff I mean it;s the real deal !!!!  1 try the micheladas even better than in Mexico   2 try the camarones agua chile (like ceviche on steriods)  3 this place has both traditional mexican food and great mariscos ( sea food)"}
{"text":"My son Tried the chicken tacos for the first time (in like 12-13 years that ive been eating here religiously) and i could not stop eating them even though I was STUFFED. Lol Everything is amazingly good- but again top things to try:  Butterflied red snapper fried  Tostada de ceviche Cameron Coctel de Cameron  Pollo a la Padilla ( takes a Lil extra time but worth it) CHEESECAKE FLAN is the BEST THING I EVER ATE."}
{"text":"5 stars for their garlic shrimp! Best garlic shrimp I've had in my whole life. The corn tortillas are homemade and the white rice is delicious."}
{"text":"I showed up around 6:30pm and was amazed at the lack of vehicles in the parking lot.  By 7pm more people started showing up.  The service was excellent, everyone was very friendly.  My food was good starting with the salsa and warm chips.  I ordered enchiladas, a taco, and rice.  It was typical mexican fare to me with the exception of the carnitas taco, which was outstanding!  It was juicy pork piled high on two corn tortillas topped with fresh cilantro and onion.  I could overhear a local regular suggesting a friend order the chile poblano and tamale, while he himself was ordering the special burrito of the night.  He said, \"it's all good, you can't go wrong\" and I'm inclined to believe him."}
{"text":"Been coming here for many years. It has never let me down. Food is really good portions are big had to share my plate. Give yourself time to come and enjoy this place."}
{"text":"We are new to Charlotte and this has become our FAVORITE Mexican restaurant. The service is excellent and the food is outstanding. Real authentic SPICY Mexican. Love, love, love Mar y Tierra!"}
{"text":"This Mexican marisco restaurant is a true gem . The food is amazing and service is great . Prices are justified by the amazingly delicious food ."}
{"text":"This place is a must try seafood Mexican restaurant. I like their seafood enchiladas and their stuffed fish fillets are great as well."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times with my food adventurous friend. It has never disappointed us. Our favorite is the Parrillada with Red Snapper. When they set the hot pan down on the table we always tell ourselves we will never be able to finish it all. WRONG!! If you look very carefully you might see us licking the pan for the rest of the octopus. Staff is very nice! Even if there is sometimes a bit of a language barrier we all figure it out and always get what we ask for. Would and have recommended Mar Y Tierra to friends."}
{"text":"Went to eat on my birthday first time here, the food was amazing as well as the service i really loved this place will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. I go here for lunch often. Quick service, cheap food, good margaritas.  Outside the sign says, \"Now Open.\" That has been what the sign has said for a few years now, which is odd.   I think they get most of their business for lunch. They are open until 9, but when I drive by after work the parking lot is usually pretty empty."}
{"text":"For lunch near Lakepointe, this is pretty quick, cheap & delicious.  I've never had to wait for a table, and the food is always brought out quickly.  Service is good and the food isn't bad either - but I'm not a Mexican food critic either, I stick to the Speedy Gonzales special (enchilada, taco & rice).  Great option if you're tired of waiting in line at Salsaritas and want to enjoy a sit down lunch."}
{"text":"The place is a short drive from my house, and when going out to eat, mar y tierra is one of the choices. The people at the restaurant are very friendly and know whats best for the customers.  If anybody is looking for mexican food, mar y tierra would be a place to try it out"}
{"text":"OK for Mexican food.  Hot chips were served.  Salsa was good.  Ordered chili rellano. It was traditional style and tasted OK, The sauce was not what I expected, but good.  The service was very good."}
{"text":"Oh, I 've worked a half a mile from this free standing building for over 10 years.  Several different restaurants have lived and died here, but I had not been inside this building until today.  Previously the closest American Mexican restaurants were over on Woodlawn, so this is nice to have so close.  Mar Y Tierra is clean, open, and a little more organized than the other nearby Mexican joints.  A sanitation grade of 98 is displayed behind the counter.  The service is quick and efficient.  The food is cheap, the portions are decent size, and it tastes good.  The menu is nowhere near as extensive as an Azteca, but there's still plenty to choose from.  For $5, I got a shredded chicken burrito (not huge but a good lunch size) and some beans and rice.  The chips and salsa were good, but salsa was very spicy.    Due to economics and close proximity to the office of this place, I'll be going back often.  They were busy too, so hopefully they will stick around a while."}
{"text":"Went today with my girlfriend to eat here, she recommended it to me so I thought I'd try it. We both got the garlic shrimp came with fries,rice,shrimp,salad. Also tortillas. Everything was amazing the flavor was so good. I've tasted a lot of shrimp in my day but this is be far the best I've ever tasted. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times in the past year or so and it has quickly become my favorite Mexican restaurant.  The restaurant is always very clean and service is always fast.  I've had everything from tacos to enchiladas to fajitas and everything is delicious with good quality ingredients.  My only complaint is that the salsa a little too spicy for my taste, but it still has a good flavor.  I love the fact the the dishes with ground beef are not dripping with grease, which is my biggest complaint at other Mexican restaurants.  I even brought my mom, who isn't the biggest Mexican fan, and she loved it.  The restaurant is always packed at lunch, and usually deserted in the evening.  But don't let a lack of customers stop you.  The food is still always cooked fresh.  I highly recommend and hope this place is able to stay open for a long time."}
{"text":"Awesome, just awesome.  I was traveling through and in the mood for Mexican so I found this place on Yelp.  I pulled up to the parking lot of the freestanding building at around 8:45 pm and thought it was closed.  The building looked dark and there is exactly one other car in the big parking lot.  I went in and there was one occupied table but the young man behind the counter assured me they were open so I sat down at a booth.  He recommended the fajitas and I ordered a mix of chicken and beef.    The warm chips and spicy salsa came out right away and they were both tasty.  The fajita took a while to prepare, a sign that they make everything fresh.  And fresh they were, down to the warm flour tortillas.  The plate of chicken and beef came loaded with green peppers and onions and the frying pan it came in was sizzling hot.  Also came with a separate plate of rice, beans and a Mexican salad (with guac and sour cream).  All of it went into the fajita which may not be the way you're supposed to eat it but it worked for me.    The service was very friendly.  Total tab including a beer:  $15.  Cheap, filling and delicious."}
{"text":"Is there any greater feeling than finding one of those hidden gems that hardly anyone knows about, so you don't want to say too much, and yet you can't help but want to spread the word...well that is how I feel after visiting Mar Y Tierra for the first time tonight, what a pleasant surprise to say the least!  Decided to give this restaurant a shot after finding one of the super-terrific 90% off restaurant.com coupons for $10 off a $15 minimum purchase.   Figured what do we have to lose as it is always nice to be able to spend less than $20 on dinner for two, so why not give it a shot and see what happens, and what happened was we found a new restaurant to add to \"our list\"!  The location is pretty much in the middle of nowhere so we weren't too surprised to find plenty of parking spaces available, but definitely expected to see more than two cars in the lot given that it was 7pm on a Saturday night.  Walked in and we were greeted by our friendly host who initially sat us under the flat screen TV, but had no issue when we asked for a booth a bit further away from the TV.  When we arrived, there were two guys there watching baseball highlights on ESPN, but after about five minutes, we were soon left as the only patrons, which again was weird given that we couldn't understand how a restaurant could survive with basically no customers during prime time on a Saturday night.  Needless to say, our expectations weren't that great, but boy were we in for a surprise!  We started with the spinach and queso dip for $3.25 and then ordered the double order of Mar Y Tierra Fajitas, as we had never experienced so many different items in a fajita before (Chicken, Steak, Shrimp, Scallops, Carnitas, Chorizo) so we had to give this one a shot.  At $21.95 it was in the ballpark (give or take a couple bucks) with what other places charge for \"Fajitas for 2\" but when this dish arrived, it was definitely a sight to behold as it should have been called \"Fajitas for 4\" (and this is from a guy who can finish off the Wild Wing Cafe Nacho Platter for 3-4 as an appetizer and still hit the lunchtime wing buffet as my main course!).    The fajitas were HUGE and they didn't skimp on filling or tortillas like most places do.  We actually got 8 tortillas total between us, which was great, considering most places give you about 2-3 each and then charge for extras.  The food was excellent, the service was attentive and friendly, and overall the meal was not only filling and tasty, but also was a TREMENDOUS value when all was said and done, as our total bill (food plus tax plus tip) after the coupon was only $22 for the Super Fajitas and the Spinach Queso Dip.        On a side note, no other patrons ever came in the whole time we were there (about 45 mins), so that was somewhat disappointing, as we will definitely be back (even without a restaurant.com coupon), but not sure if the restaurant will still be there unless business picks up soon.  Highly recommended, as it is always nice to find a hidden gem with great food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"For me the location is not the best but the food is euthenic and good. It is also inexpensive. I love their ceviche."}
{"text":"I like the food at this place. It's not the best authentic mexican restaurant, but it's better than a lot of others.   The location gets a lot of their patrons during the week because of the businesses around. However, during their lunch rush they don't have a dedicated person to take to go orders.   I initally tried to call in my order twice and no one picked up. So I had to wait an additional 8-10 min when I got the location to place my to go order. My food took another 12 min. or so. If I didn't work close, then this would be an issue in getting back to work."}
{"text":"Mar Y Tierra is a mom and pop Mexican restaurant that is worth the stop. My husband gets their carne asada and it is the best. I have ordered every type of shrimp and enjoyed every plate. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. Their salsa and chips are really good and the service is consistently good."}
{"text":"Decent food I thought overall. The warm chips and salsa was great. The huge margarita in a soup bowl sized glass was very good. The guacamole was more like an avocado style dip than being real smashed avocados with lime. The fajitas were decent, more veggies than meat but had a good flavor. What was strange is that I was there at 8 PM on Friday and the place was dead empty other than one other table besides me. Service however I must say was excellent."}
{"text":"Definitely off the beaten path.  Pulled up and only a couple of cars in the lot.  Was  a little skeptical, but based on other reviews, went in, ordered, and ate a wonderful meal, drank a great margarita, and enjoyed the service.  Very good food and very reasonably priced!  Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"If you want Mexican food, then mar y Tierra is where you should be ! Food is always served hot and fresh. I received my food pretty quick, they seem to never sacrifice quality for speed. And I love it!!! It's 5 stars from me!!!"}
{"text":"I love their Planchas! Its a platter with fish, octopus, shrimp, onions, peppers and comes with rice, beans and soup. OR you can pick the platter with carne asada, chicken and green chile pork. Their food is delicious! Try their oysters and ceviche!! I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Probably the most authentic Mexican taqueria on the east side of Las Vegas. At first glance this restaurant seems like your ordinary hole-in-the-wall taqueria, that is until you try their food. I ordered the tacos de lengua. Initial thoughts upon opening my to-go container were that these tacos look like any other ordinary tacos, then I bit into one of these delicious meat vessels. The meat was tender, lightly seared to perfection. The salsa was incredible."}
{"text":"Went in here for some shrimp cocktails and maybe something else. Read some reviews about this place here and they made this place sound amazing. We order the shrimp cocktails with octopus and some micheladas but they were both just ok. The michelada itself didn't have much flavor and neither did the cocktail. I've had way better sea food. Great thing about this place is the customer service."}
{"text":"My host Dan told us about this place so took A chance on it and it was boom.  I had the bacon wrapped shrimp"}
{"text":"Customer service is critical in the restaurant business. The cook actually refused to remake a dish that he screwed up. Here is a suggestion for you guys. If the customer wants vanilla, get the customer vanilla. Don't try to convince them that the chocolate is better. He should have that."}
{"text":"Ok Mexican, but it is Cheaply priced.  I have only been here fore  the lunch rush and they are pretty fast at getting your food out to you.  Depending on who you have as your server will vary on how/if you can get refills.  The lunch menu is cheap, and you get a some good portions. I get the #8 Burrito and quesadilla.  Choice of beef or chicken.    Do not be scare of the burrito it is basically a rolled chicken tortilla, served with sauce on top.  Nothing scary on the inside for the timid.  Nothin great , but nothing bad about the place either.  It just food."}
