{"text":"I certainly won't give Divots a 5-star rating but I can't think of too many places that I would. It's a bar. The food is good, service is good, and prices are good. Check out the offerings for gift certificates through restaurant.com because you will end up getting even more for your money. I don't think I can say enough about the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich but I would hate to look at the nutritional contents, especially the calories and fat but they are out of this world!!! I have never been when the place is packed so it's a pretty nice place to go to for a relaxing meal and/or drink. The patio is nice, especially in nice weather. You can look out at the driving range, watch tv, converse with friends or just hang out for a relatively inexpensive experience."}
{"text":"Decent food, horrible management.  Sat ourselves and waited 10 mins for a very flustered lady to come over.  Ordered drinks, and waited another 10 mins for her to come back and take our order.  She returned 5 mins layer to inform us that the food would take 30 mins.  I asked if we could have the chips and dip appetizer earlier.  She checked with the cook, and he said, \"absolutely not\".  Servers response was, what am I supposed to do, I'm not the owner.  It is 5 min from my house, and we won't be back."}
{"text":"My family and I really like going to Divots.  Usually go once a week. Food is always good. Salad is so simple but refreshing.  Love their Italian dressing. Great hamburgers, wings, Philly steak sandwich, fish fry and daily special board. Just went this past Saturday (5/17/14) and there was live entertainment.  A young girl was singing acoustically and doing a great job.  Plus it wasn't too loud, still able to carry on a conversation. I have been going to this bar for years.  I think it is great. Over 12 years ago, I had a fundraiser here for our kid's hockey team which included family and friends of the team.  Tony, the owner, treated us terrifically.  He went out of his way to treat everyone including the pain in the butt children to a very good time.  The service was spectacular and he did most of the servicing.  I will never forget that. Great place to go any day of the week with or without children.  There are a lot of families in the place at dinner time after or before baseball games. The grounds include batting cages, putt-putt, sand volleyball courts, a driving range and an ice cream store up front."}
{"text":"Batting cages, putt putt, driving range, and creamsicle ice cream, what more could a Tom girl at heart love more! This place is cheap and a great place to go for a date or just to kill some time being semi active. They have volleyball leagues here as well in the summer, which are fun to play in. Divots is kind of run down, but it has this down to earth charm that I like. Ill continue to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We have an office down the block from Divots. And I've been here 2-3 times. The waitress/server/greeter is a riot. My orders are always warm and most importantly correct when placing telephone orders.  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Divots for nearly 20 years. They have great food at great prices. However, service has declined over the last several years. The wait times to place an order and get your food are long and they do not staff appropriately. On our most recent visit with a party of 7 we sat at a table in the half empty restaurant for nearly 20 minutes without a single server acknowledging us or bringing a menu. We chose to leave. We walked over to the bar and asked for a manger but we were told one was not on site. It's a shame, but we will likely not return to a place we have enjoyed for almost 20 years."}
{"text":"First of all, the food isn't bad for a bar & grill.   The beer prices are a little high for a \"dive bar\", however.   (it's not a total dive, but it's definitely lacking in personality).  That said, I've eaten here plenty of times.   Lately I found a could purchase gift certificates on \"restaurant.com\", so I bought a few, knowing I'd frequent the place.  On my 2nd visit with a gift certificate, while waiting for food, one of the employees (maybe a manager?) was off duty & sat at the bar next to me.   He proceeded to tell me & everyone within earshot \"we don't need customers with coupons & gift certificates\"...not quoting exactly, but that's the context of what was said.  Imagine how uncomfortable I felt knowing I was redeeming a restaurant.com gift certificate!      Anyhow, the certificate was for $15 of a purchase of $22.50 or more...We spent about $32, so we're covered.      When I went to redeem the certificate I was abruptly (rudely) told \"This isn't valid on SPECIALS!\"  (I had the fish, which wasn't as much on \"Special\" as it is a weekly feature).  Anyhow, I had spent over $22.50 WITHOUT the fish, so I didn't see what the issue was....I even said ring the fish up separately, and I'll still be able to use the certificate.... She did it, but she was pissed.  I haven't been back since, and don't plan to be any time soon.   I actually know the owner casually & will discuss this with him as well."}
{"text":"As my husband says - I've never had a bad meal.  Yes, It's bar food but it's pretty darn good - we've been in NR for 8 years now and this is one of our stops.  I think it can use a little sprucing up as the atmosphere is pretty plain.  If you want a good meal and don't care for the scenery try it."}
{"text":"Small bar and restaurant with a cool atmosphere. Great place to visit for outdoor sports with family and friends. Drinks are very inexpensive! Typical bar food but tasty."}
{"text":"Stopped here 4-6-18. Only like 6-8 people in bar. 4 girls and 1 male bartender standing talking behind bar. After a couple minutes, he walks right by us and goes down to a couple who was eating and asked if they needed another drink. He then goes back to hanging out with girls. I had to ask him for service and a menu. Not a good start..... we finally get beers (15-20 minutes after entering ) and i again had to tell him we were ready to order after a few minutes. Our food (2 hamburgers ) finally shows up 20 more minutes later not the way i ordered. Lets try a little harder here to run a more caring and efficient establishment. Not quite sure what the 4 girls even did the whole time besides talk......"}
{"text":"The food here is great! They make the food homemade and ive never had anything here I didn't enjoy. From their pizza, burgers, philly cheese steaks, homemade macaroni and potato salads to their fish dinners, reubens and special board. Its a great place to meet up with friends or bring the family. You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Two totally different opinions here.  First: I come here every week for volleyball.  We hang out before and after our games at the outdoor bar and always have good service with good people around.  We'll head inside when it gets cold and it's usually a chill Wednesday night crowd with good service.  Too bad the kitchen closes at 11.    Second: I used to come here with old co-workers and sit outside for happy hour.  Sometimes we ate, but usually just drank.  I found out that they don't come anymore because they got yelled at for sitting there when they could be turning the tables over by people coming in and eating.  I don't even care if that actually was the case, I just think it's totally rude for anyone in management position to make their customers feel as if they are just in the way because they're not making enough money off of them.  Get a bigger patio, dick.    Also, sand volleyball sucks when it's the spring of hell."}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere!  Excellent food!  Pizza, wings, burgers, and Buffalo chicken wrap are excellent!  Very reasonably priced"}
