{"text":"Amazing food!! It is comparable to my mom's cooking falafel is incredible. The owner is so friendly - the restaurant is clean and tidy and food is delicious. Def recommend."}
{"text":"Had heard from others this was a great shawarma place so drove the extra bit to get here.  Definitely worth it!  Ordered the chicken shawarma wrap with all the fixins.  One of the best wraps I've had in recent memory.  Fresh and tasty and did not skimp on the fillings.   Nice decor and reasonably priced, would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best shawarma place in Oakville. The chicken is fresh and nicely marinated. Unlike places like Pita Nutso or Osmows, there's little too no fat in the chicken. Hence you actually taste the meat vs. chewing on globs of fat The owners are super friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after my daughter's soccer game. The staff were friendly as I joked with them about whether their garlic sauce was good or really good. I got the schwarma plate and it was excellent. The garlic sauce was really really good. While this is on the other side of town for me, it is definitely worth the trip. I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma wraps! Had the chicken and beef shawarma wraps. First time trying out this shawarma place...I HAVE TO try both the chi and beef. The chicken was really good, soft bread outside, yummy chi and fresh veggies on the inside. Same goes for the beef! The beef had a really authentic taste that is hard to find in shawarma places these days. The hot sauce seeped through the bread and was sooo good! Great food, great price! Why are you still reading this...go to Shawarmarama!"}
{"text":"Worth the drive from Burlington! Excellent service, and good flavor. Large portions especially the plates. Quiet place to eat. Can't wait for next visit."}
{"text":"Simple shawarma joint that won't disappoint. Went here for some chicken shawarma and we were satisfied with the order."}
{"text":"A coworker told me about this place so I decided to check it out for lunch. Perfect experience! The place is clean and the ambiance feels modern and personal. The customer service was great as the gentleman preparing my order engaged in conversation with everyone and seemed very informed. Prices were pretty cheap and the portions were above average. The food was fresh and delicious! I got the chicken shawarma - the meat was so moist, the vegetables were crisp, and the flavour was amazing. I will definitely recommend this place to everyone and will be back soon with friends and family."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say to this place. I have been coming here almost every other week because this place just brings out consistent quality food. I discovered this place as I wanted a shawarma joint close to my house and found this hidden gem. I'm pretty sure it's popular to the workers around the area as well.  I came here recently for a Tuesday lunch and ordered Beef kebab plate with rice. Juicy well-shaped beef, rice is cooked al dente and super tasty. I love the rice here! They put very generous amount of garlic sauce which I honestly don't mind because it compliments the salad, meat, and rice very well. They add spicy sauce as well, mmm spicy, so all in all the whole place it good."}
{"text":"In town on business in Oakville and as I usually do in new cities, I started my search for my checklist food spots. At the top of that list is usually a good Mediterranean spot. This place was fairly close to my hotel so i decided to check it out. After arriving, the location is very clean and the menu was very vast. This visit, I settled on the beef kabob plate with salad and rice as my side. The kabob was cooked fresh. Took about 15 minutes for it to be ready. The meat was seasoned very well and the accompanying sauces which came on top of the meal were quite tasty as well. The salad was rather regular but what I expected. On the other hand, the  rice was very tasty. Cooked to the perfect consistency.(not overly soft or too hard). Next time I'm in the city , this will be a place I don't mid visiting again to test one or a few of the other options!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for lunch based on good reviews. They had 2 shish tawook wrap for $9.99 special so decided to go for it. Was told would take 15 minutes to have it ready. The size of the wraps is a bit small compared to other places, however it tasted good and the meat was tender. The place is clean, and it looks like they have a driveway for pickups although I haven't seen anyone use it. Anyways giving 3 stars because food was good but nothing particularly stands out."}
{"text":"Good food but took a while getting my shish tawook cooked and it was a bit over cooked and got dry. However the person that ordered after me decided to get another chicken schwarma after finishing his first. I'll probably try that next time and see how that is."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great prices, and friendly owner who gets his spices from back home! Our group had the chicken and beef shawarmas and the falafel! All superb!"}
{"text":"Fresher-than-average shawarma stop in a strange/transitional area.  Chicken Shawarma Plate (with Salad, Rice OR Fries) was $10.99; the wrap on its own is $5.75 so it's pretty cheap eats!  (Marginally cheaper than Paramount.) If you're not that hungry, the Plate can be easily shared among 2ppl.  All the elements on the Plate, including the Salad tasted fresh!  Salad even had fried pita pieces on top for that extra crunch.  There are booths/seating to dine-in, but it seemed like more of a take-out place.  WiFi apparently available, but you'll hafta ask for the password.  A solid choice if you're in the area and looking for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Came to this place for the reviews and even though they had only 5, I read them and noticed they were not theirs!! Also another Elite came here! So, yes.... great place, great service, good food and very clean! Congrats!!! When I first stepped inside, there was a group of at least 10 woman all Arab women inside.... so that gave it some more credibility... I ordered a beef kebab in a sandwich that was made at that moment, so I had to wait about 15 minutes.... also had the falafel which were very good, came with a salad .... they were fresh made, crisp and not over fried!! The tabuleh was good... not the best I've had, but good and refreshing! The pita with the falafel was not heated which caught my eye, but it was fresh and soft... so  Please note this is kind of a fast food place where you order / pay at the counter and then they can take the food to your table.... All in all I recommend this place!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Yelp photos showing a freshly made falafel made me hopeful that this could be a good spot for Mediterranean food.  With a number of positive reviews, Yelp didn't steer me wrong on this one.    In a small little building just off of Ford Drive, Shawarmarama shares the area with a commercial fast food spot.  It doesn't look like much but when you walk in, you noticed how clean and well maintained it is.  It looks new with not a speck of dirt anywhere.  There are at least 5 booth tables that can sit easily 4 people in each and there are more smaller seating if it gets crowded.    Service here is immediately attentive and also alert.  It never felt lazy or disinterested.  I appreciated the 2 people (owners?) were constantly asking questions to make sure you got exactly the best they could offer and what you liked the most.    The menu looks like most other Mediterranean places with very fair pricing for wraps and plates.  They have the chicken and beef on offering in addition to the falafels for vegetarian.    One thing I liked is the vegetables on display... they all were fresh.  No wilting or discolouring!  Also, I liked how they got the frozen fries and freshly made falafel all ready to be deep fried after ordering... nothing is held premade and just reheated.  Another group ordered before us and we saw the plates being made... they were very generous in chicken shawarma on top of the fries.  This seems to be a good spot for those who are hungry for plates of meat!    Falafel plate with hummus (extra) and fries - Totally loved how they freshly fried up the Falafel.  I can't believe I have to say that but freshly made falafels make such a difference.  These were fried up hot and crispy and fully cooked.  They had a pleasant note of spice to it and the addition of the garlic and hot sauce just added to the flavour.  Fries were standard and didn't add to the plate.  Hummus was generous and smooth.  The falafel definitely was one of the better ones I've had in the GTA.  4/5  Great little spot for anyone who's starving for Mediterranean.  Freshly made with generous portions and fair prices ... really can't ask for any better out of a fast casual spot."}
{"text":"This is my second time back because the falafel is absolutely incredible. He restaurant is really clean and the owner / chef - Khaled really takes pride in his work. The ingredients are so fresh and I can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this place out, I wanted to find Something other than paramount, as paramount lately has been going down hill with their quality and consistency. I am so happy I found this gem! I ordered for a falafel and a chicken shawarma both were delicious. The falafels were made hot and Fresh right in front of you. I will definitely be going there again!!"}
{"text":"Shawarma taste good. But slightly smaller than at other shawrama place. The friends were made fresh to order so they were very crispy which i loved.   Friendly staff. Very polite. Great service."}
{"text":"As close as it gets to the delicious shawarma's I had in Montreal for all those years. Great owners too, will customize your plate to whatever you like!"}
