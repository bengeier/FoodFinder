{"text":"One of my favorite Latin Food restaurant in the GTA, too bad finding a parking has always been a problem in the downtown area.  But the food makes it worth the trouble to drive 1 hour across town just to have a nice dinner (make it 2 hours during rush hours)  It's the best food out there.  I try to visit them at least once a month, if there was an easier way to get to them not having to drive by down town area, I'll surely be going more often."}
{"text":"Family of 4. Delicious empanadas and bandeja paisa to die for.  Prices are a bit on the higher end for what you get.  Service was fast and courteous.   Try the flan as dessert.   Colombian music running and decor adds to the whimsical atmosphere of this place.     Overall a great restaurant true to its colombian roots.  Food is promptly served,  temperature is right and service is fast.   The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is my opinion on not being priced right.   Try the empanadas and pony malta (malted soft drink)."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem on St Clair. Don't order the bendeja paisa unless you're really hungry. If you're a carnivore you'll fall in love, trust me. The stuffed trout was really good as well, as were the appetizers. The price was right - nothing is really cheap these days, nothing good anyway - the service was good, and I definitely plan on going here again."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and very helpful since we don't speak Spanish.  The food was fresh and delicious.  We even took empanadas home b cause they were so good.  Never had Colombian before, but it seemed very authentic."}
{"text":"Great little spot for authentic colombian food.  I always get the bandeja paisa but I also highly recommend the fish soup/stew and the empanadas.  The house hot sauce is also excellent. Not enough good things to say about it. Sometimes they have live music, but the food alone is enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"Great authentic Columbian food. Real home cooking and the service is really good. The portions are large and the price is good"}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice restaurant in the area. In the area, there are many Latin American restaurant, but Mi Tierra Restaurant was pretty unique in the area. Their foods are good. The prices are not cheap, but they have good size. The place is spacious and seats are comfortable. The service is fine. I did not know Colombian restaurant has arepa. I will try them next time."}
{"text":"Always fresh and truly traditional colombian food.  Start with their yummy empanadas and follow with the traditional 'bandeja tipica' or 'bandeja paisa' (if you dare to go for the extra avocado and chorizo).  It's a real piece of Colombia on St. Clair!"}
{"text":"Es un lugar excelente , buen servicio , comida deliciosa Bandeja Paisa , Tostones con Guacamole y jugo de Maracuya  , se lo recomiendo a todo el que le guste La Cocina Colombiana y al que no que lo trate porque es muy rica"}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love Mi Tierra. Last night my son and I arrived early in the evening to a bustling restaurant and were quickly greeted after claiming a booth. Our first server saw that we did not speak Spanish, and sent over a terrific replacement who told us that she only spoke a little English. Even so, we were never misunderstood, and felt very welcomed.  We ordered first juices: my son the mango & water, and I the passion fruit & milk. These are frothy concoctions made with ice, and are so very delicious. After our meal, my son ordered a second one to go that was blackberry & milk.  My son had the Bandeja Paisana, which our server told us was \"very Colombian\". My son is not necessarily a picky eater, but is not always culinarily curious. He proceeded to inhale his plate of food because everything tasted so good. I thought that he might not like the pork skin, but ate most of everything on the plate. He especially love the smoked sausage.  I had the Bistec A Caballo, which, too, was absolutely delicious. The almost sweet tomato based sauce over the steak paired perfectly with the savory grilled skirt steak and fried eggs. The potato and yuca on the plate gave a nice starchy balance.  I only regret that we were so full from our dinner that we couldn't try anything from the bakery. We will absolutely have to try something on our next trip because we are definitely going back again soon."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. Great home cooked hearty quality food with large portions- great value. The service was very friendly. The empanadas were yummy and not too greasy and the side salsa with them was quite spicey as well as flavourful. The atmosphere is quaint and authentic, it reminded me of the restaurants in Bogota."}
{"text":"The reviews for this restaurant are pretty much on point. The only thing is the prices on the menu on the photos a year ago are way off now. As of this post the prices are around 20% higher than they used to be which I find a bit steep.  Bandeja Paisa - $20 Bandeja Tipica - $16 Meat Platter - $21  Not sure if there's a different menu for weekend."}
{"text":"Came with a friend who is  Comumbian. So glad we found this place. She enjoyed all the things we eat and definitely I enjoy. Seeing her enjoy everything today I would say if you are \"food critic\" you will find \"bad\" things otherwise you will go away very full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Love the coffee and pan de bono. Food and service are good too. The only turn down is they close too early, but I guess is due to the location!"}
{"text":"Mi Tierra turned out to be another \"hidden\" gem in Toronto.   Great food, pretty decent portions for the right price. We had ceviche, avocado on a corn bread. As a main course we had pescado frito (fried fish - red snapper), bandeja paisa and paella.  Everything was super!  The service has been impeccable. Never invasive and always right there when needed.   Washrooms: probably the best ever visited in Toronto. Surely not lavish and high end but 100% clean and odour free without a grain of dust anywhere you looked at."}
{"text":"I love Colombian food, so when I saw this restaurant I decided to go and give them a chance. I live in South Carolina so once a month i go to North Carolina to get my Spanish food and spices from compare foods. It was a Sunday midday, the place is small with maybe 10 tables? So once I open the door, I notice how busy they were nevertheless I was greeted very warmly by a waitress and a nice man ( maybe the owner) who apologize for the for the wait and gave us the menu. After a 5 minutes we were sit and the waitress offered us drinks and appetizers: we got water and chicken empanadas. It arrive in no time, and my kids love. My kids ordered grill  Chichen and I ordered cazuela de mariscos. Even though they were busy, our order didn't take long. I must say that I love loved my cazuela de mariscos! The portion was generous so We couldn't finish it so we it to go. My only complaint is that I ordered 4 empanadas to go along arepa con huevo and a skirt steak and when I got home, they didn't give me the empanadas nor the steak event though they charged me for it. I was so disappointed because I done live near by. Nevertheless I called them to make them aware of it, and they apologized and assured me that they would replace it when I return but unfortunately I live 50 miles away so wouldn't go back until next month. Since I love the food so much, I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have very limited knowledge of Colombian food, but I've had bandeja paisa at about four different places, and Mi Tierra's version was easily the best I've had. In particular, the chicharron was crispy and tasty rather than limp and greasy. And there was enough food for two meals. I want to go back and try something else, though I'm not sure what else I should order."}
{"text":"Best Colombian food in town (better in quality than Los Paisas). The plátanos maduros are never too oily and always sweet. The bandeja país which is a classic Colombian dish has really good beans and the chicharrón is usually really crunch so you can eat the whole thing which is how it's supposed to be eaten (I've been to other restaurants where part of the chicharrón is squishy). The chorizo is delicious and the white arepas are really yummy. I also highly recommend the mojarra fish because it is cooked very well. I always order a jugo de mora en leche with my food and it always tastes great."}
{"text":"Had the Sancocho and it was very tasty!  The beef in the soup had great flavour! My husband is from Dominican Republic and was missing the taste of his mom's Sancocho on this cold icy day so looked up online and found this place.  Just what my husband needed and me too!  I picked up the food and it was well worth the drive!  Will be back to eat inside!"}
{"text":"It was ok. I had paisa bandeja and the egg was super overdone, the beans weren't the tastiest. The meat was good, but it was just steak and a pork sausage. No blood sausage? Taste was not memorable, not bad either. For $14 I'd expect a slightly better quality. My favorite was their chimichurri sauce which I slathered on the beef so I can have some flavor."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, Great service and food. I highly recommend the bandeja paisa. Empanadas are also very good."}
{"text":"Mi Tierra Restaurant offers a jovial Colombian escape from the dark, dreary Canadian winter outside. Inside you will be greeted with pleasant Latin American music and warm smiles. A great place to go to if you are like me and can't afford a vacation down south during the darkest, coldest time of the year. For the couple hours I spent there on a Friday night I forgot I was in Toronto as I a sipped a margarita and munched on a delicious shrimp appetizer smothered in a warm, buttery garlic sauce all the while enjoying the live Spanish tunes in the background. The restaurant's main focus is authentic Colombian cuisine. For a main course, I ordered the typical dish of Colombia - where there was a variety of food on the plate (a grilled slab of beef, fried pork, rice topped with an egg, plantain's, and refried beans). Although, it was a very large quantity of food. I found it lacked excitement. There were too many parts to the meal and my tastebuds couldn't concentrate. My mother had the Pollo Arepa - which is basically grilled chicken topped with a salsa like mixture layered on top of flat corn bread. She found it was tasty but not entirely memorable. However, their hot side sauce, the memory of the appetizer, and the fun latin vibe managed to keep the food experience to stay on a high note.

{"text":"I've eaten as this place many times and if it wasn't because they actually have good food I wouldn't have given it so many chances. The wait staff actually roll their eyes when people come in. There is no greeting and no welcoming feeling when you step in the door. My last visit was a to go order to avoid the bad service. When I walked in she was eating at the counter and looked mad that I had walked in to Interrupt her lunch. I placed an order for two items and then quickly changed my quantity to one. She looked at me rolled her eyes and said there was nothing she could do to change the quantity and was proceeding to charge me for two. ??  That was bizarre to me and I just walked out. Needless to say I don't plan on coming back to a place where they make you feel bad for walking through the door and have such horrible customer service."}
{"text":"They aren't kidding when they say it's Authentic Colombian.  A Canadian wouldn't know Authentic Latin American if a Taco truck rammed in to their Toyota... which is why I saw not many Canadians here which is too bad, they should come.  I am a man of the meat and not to betray my core, I ordered the Picada / Meat Platter, with grilled beef, chicken, Chicarron, morcilla, Colombian sausage, fried plantain.  Let me focus on what's different here, the distinguishing feature of Colombian food from what I ordered.  The Chicharron / Bacon is a super thick set of slices of bacon cut with a jagged sawtooth style and super crispy fried.  This is the highlight but eat it fast-- it's one of those things that due to crunch factor level is only good when freshly arrived.  Don't touch the skillet amigo-- super caliente.  The other new one morcilla is a black blood sausage but don't let that scare you off.  It's a much more accessible variety than others, it's filled with fluffy rice and herbs inside.  The fluff texture and savory flavor have won me over.    And a liter of Sangria later we were done."}
{"text":"As a first timer Columbia's eater it was very authentic experience. We tried their empanadas, it was good yet very different from Spanish style. Their bakery selections were also very good. Cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"mmm comida authentico de colombia!!! great food, ive only been there 3 times and it has never disappointed me...  The interior is cute, all decked out in pictures and souvenirs representing Colombia. The service is great, the servers are personable and always able to provide recommendations. For starters I recommend their traditional soup, along with their in-house empanandas. For mains I would recommend the Bandeja Paisa if you've got an appetite! This traditional dish consists of avocado, steak, roasted pork, rice, egg, and beans... On weekends they have a karaoke singer keeping restaurant patrons entertained!!!"}
{"text":"NOT an authentic Colombian bakery! In all my years I've never seen a latin bakery that doesn't make café con leche, not to be confused with American coffee and creamer! You definitely cannot make café con leche from a black American coffee pot.   Upon walking into this poor excuse of a Colombian bakery I must admit I got a little excited thinking that I would finally get a taste of that delicious hot sweet latin coffee that we refer to as \"café con leche\" but oh how wrong I was.   The guy behind the counter quickly asked for my order and I immediately placed it anxiously anticipating a nice cup of café! When I saw him reaching for an American Coffee pot I cringed! I immediately told him to STOP! And gave him the opportunity of correcting himself. It appeared he had no clue what I was referring to when I asked if they have \"REAL CAFÉ CON LECHE\" he didn't seem to understand why I was so upset.   I walked out in disbelief at how they could refer to themselves as a \"Colombian Bakery\" shame on them."}
{"text":"This has to be the best Colombian restaurant hands down. The portions are huge, the food is delicious, the service is great and it is pretty cheap!   The restaurant it self is decent in size and on the weekends that I have gone they had a band which can become pretty loud if you are trying to have a quite dinner. I always order the Bandeja Tipica and always end up having to take it home because the portion is big! The Chicarron (bacon like) is really tasty. If you haven't had Colombian food before or are looking for a good place that has Colombian food, than this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Colombian food is so hard to find!!! Especially a good quality place.  This place is great for authentic, tasty, hearty Colombian food. They have a great selection of baked breads, traditional entres, and must-have fruit smoothies (yumm, mora).  Don't expect anything fancy when you come here! This is a no-frills establishment, but boy does it hit the spot when you're craving real empanadas or a full bandeja paisa. Also, the staff is friendly and prices are fairly reasonable."}
{"text":"I was there last saturday...we had bandeja paisa...really good portion and tasty. I order Churrasco. Nice piece of ribeye juicy and well seasoning. Highly  recommended place.  Great job."}
{"text":"Great Colombian food, one of the best places who have empanadas! If you're looking for a traditional Colombian meal, this is the place to eat!"}
{"text":"Great Columbian food!  Although we were the only customers there during a weekday, we were serviced really well.    I will get right to the food part as it was truly enjoyable!  I ordered the soursap fruit juice and it tasted great!  For the appetizer I ordered a few Columbian empanadas which were freshly cooked and it came with a sauce that apparently was delicious, but I wouldn't know because I don't eat spicey.   I also ordered the muscles, and they were so delicious that I wanted to order another one!! But I still had my main entree coming.  The sauce they used for the muscles was emphasised when you added the fresh lemon onto it. Very saucy !!! and it came with bread which I needed more of because I had to finish the sauce!!!  Finally the main entrance Bandeja.  This was slightly different than some other Latin American countries because it came with a huge piece of bacon! I've never seen bacon like this before. Very fattening but ok to nibble on.  The beans were cooked really well and the plantain just perfect!!!!   Unfortunately, there was no room for dessert but I most definitely will be back.   The lady who served us was attentive and super nice. Her smile was genuine and she truly appreciated our service.   Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Been itching to try out some latin taste and was going to go to El Salvadorian for some pupusa, but unfortunately, they don't like Tuesdays. So on we go to Mi Tierra. The place is nice. It has a very nice South American feel. Didn't have any of their drinks, but I did see some drinks that looked authentically from Colombia.  I might be wrong though.. Never really been nor have I been educated into Colombian culture... Menu seems limited. They seem to be all variation of a few dishes. Started off with empanada. This was the first time I had an empanada that was crunchy on the outside. Again, I'm assuming this is customary to Colombian empanada. I do like it better than the usual empanada. For dinner, I ordered Bandeja Paisa and my gf ordered the fried snapper. The paisa is ginormous loaded with some meat. There were so many things going on in that plate that it was overwhelming. In summary, the chicharron was good, the grilled beef was amazingly tender, the avocado was fresh, the beans were meh, plantain was awesome and the arepa was ok. My gf's snapper.... Well it was fried... Pretty plain imo. Same with the side dishes that came with it. It was a decent place to try. Nothing really to complain about."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I've ever eaten Colombian food before, so I was certainly very curious to check this place out.  We arrived right at 12:00 on a Sunday and the place was completely empty. Not the most encouraging sign. Nevertheless, we forged ahead and ordered.  We started with an order of empanadas. They arrived fresh and hot, and accompanied with a very tasty (and quite spicy) sauce/salsa. No complaints with this item; it was delicious and compulsively edible.  For my main, I went with the Typical Dish, which comes with grilled beef, fried plantains, beans, a hunk of thickly-cut bacon, rice, and a fried egg. It's an impressive amount of food and it was all very tasty. There were no spectacular flavors on display, but it was a well composed, freshly-prepared dish. It tasted like something I'd eat at a legit Colombian household."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly authentic! Portions are large and prices are really reasonable. We ordered empanadas to start with, which were delicious and served with an amazing sauce. Bandeja Tipica for our entrees, which was loaded with flavor. Would recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Living in Charlotte, it's difficult to find a good Spanish restaurant. I've been to a few around here, but this place is one of the best. It's not just good, it's excellent. The food has fresh ingredients and, more importantly, the exotic flavors that came out of that kitchen were outstanding. I give my regards and deepest respect to the chef. Also, the service was very good. Just a little more training on keeping up with the tables, but still good. We tried a flank steak that would fit in with a five-star restaurant. I should know, I've been to a few of those. Another dish I'd highly recommend is the bandeja paisa which was excellent. Overall, every dish we had was on point and delicious. Finally, you should must try the tres leches dessert (the coffee flavored one). It's to die for. Anyway, I congratulate the owner of the restaurant. Keep up the good work and the traditions of Spanish cuisine!   Without a doubt, I would rate Mi Tierra 5 stars."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Colombia food. The food was so tasty and fresh. We especially like the seafood soup as the seafood was very fresh . I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decided to pop in and try some new (to us) cuisine, it was delicious!  I had the sole which was meaty and tender with a perfectly crisp batter (to die for) paired it with a salad and plantain. The patties were also really tasty and just enough with that sauce.  My friend opted for the owners recommendation, and there was nothing left on his plate. Despite the appearance of the beef it was well done but tender, the beans were full of flavour and the portion was large. I'd definitely go back and recommend."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a Colombian restaurant/bakery so close to Compare foods, but unfortunately this place did not really impress.  The big Colombian dish, Bandeja Paisa, is really the best way to rate a place.  You can tell the care they take - is the egg just fried or is the yolk solid...is the avocado an entire fresh half, or a kind of old strip...is the chicharron a winner or too thin/burnt?    In Mi Tierra's case, it was sub-par.  Chicharron (most important part!) was burnt to a crisp.  Avocado was just a tiny chunk already blackening, egg yolk was firm.  Plantains were good, chorizo good, rice and beans just OK, portion was decent but not big.  But at $13 or so, this is one of the more expensive Bandeja Paisas around - and with Compare and their amazing chicharron just a storefront or three away, it has to be better to justify its presence.    Another bad note is the atmosphere - the restaurant was playing soccer games, which is great, but at the SAME TIME they had piped in latin music, which meant your ears had to deal with soccer announcers and the boom BAP, boom BAP cutting through it occasionally, which was just a cacophonous mess.    Los Paisas is a better restaurant just a short drive away, serving better food at a lower price and better ambiance.  Antojitos Mi Colombia is a bakery/restaurant that I would put over this experience easily as well - full meals, arepa sandwiches, or just bunuelos to go, it's a winner.  Too bad - I hope Mi Tierra improves and can compete with these in the future!"}
{"text":"Excellent Colombian Food for First Timers!  I asked my cousin to pick a restaurant at a place we had never eaten before. Some of his Colombian friends had recommended Mi Tierra, a small traditional Colombian restaurant seated on St. Clair Avenue West in North West part of Toronto. Its so small that the restaurant doesn't even have a website, I had to look up the menu on Trip Advisor.  This place was so reasonably priced, a couple of dishes split between 4 people ended up being $15.33 after taxes. The atmosphere is very much a family restaurant, casual. So many posters and trinkets from Colombia, and in the restaurant there were a lot of families from Colombia, so if people from Colombia, living in Canada come to eat here, I knew we were in a good place for local food.   The waitress was so kind and walked me through some of the popular dishes on the menu item.  We started off with the Empadas Colombianas, little beef patties which tasted delicious with their house hot sauce and a great starter.    Of course we had to order the Bandeja Paisa (typical dish) which gave us a variety of different meats (chicharron - bacon, Chorizo - Colombian sausage and grilled beef) for an amazing value. The portion sizes were very generous and this was easily shared between two people.   The stuffed trout was surprisingly flavourful, with crisp outer layer and moist, juicy inner layer. It was actually a very light meal and I enjoyed this dish the most.   I also made note of different meals coming out of the kitchen that we didn't order that looked delicious - the Picada / Meat Platter which is a combo plate of grilled beef, chicken, bacon, Morcilla, Colombian sausage, fried plantain, & casava. I will have to try that the next time I go."}
{"text":"Truly deserve a 5 star rating as the food was delicious. They have the best empanadas that I ever had hands down! Arroz con pollo and the carne asada with arepa was very tasty. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent Colombian food. Takes me back to the Colombian awesomeness. Please come and experience the wonders of a country full of history and incredible flavors."}
{"text":"Authentic and small - a local gem so to say. Don't come here to be wowed, come here for a relaxed environment with very flavourful food."}
{"text":"I went for late breakfast/early lunch on a Sunday. The food is amazing. I had the empanadas, which are amazing, the chicharones are also out of this world. They are real chicharones not the fake stuff they sell at the grocery store. The only con was the waitress was not very attentive and took a while to give us the check. But overall recommend this great Colombian restaurant."}
{"text":"Mi Tierra was introduced to me by a Colombian friend and it was love at first sight!  I always have the Bandeja Paisa, the national dish of Colombia.  It consists of steak, pork chicharron, chorizo, beans, white rice, egg, arepa and avocado.  Try the jugo de guanabana (soursop juice ).  And come hungry!  :P"}
{"text":"This was our second time at Mi Tierra. Last time, I was very impressed and gave them 5/5. We decided to order the same dishes. The meal was good, but there were a few miss steps. The chicharron that comes with the Bandeja Paisa was very dry and tough. The Currasco grilled steak was may overcooked. The Bistec de Pollo was also dry and not as flavourful. Plus, every dish we ordered was one dollar more expensive than the last time. So, I updated my review to 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excelente atención, excelente comida, el ambiente muy bonito. Gerardo y todo su equipo hacen un excelente trabajo. A todo latino les recomiendo visitar y comer tan rico."}
{"text":"Still my favourite spot to get the bandeja paisa (typical Colombian dish) plus a side order of empanadas."}
{"text":"First time trying Colombian food and was not disappointed. I had this dish called be bandeja paisa and it had everything a meat lover would dream of in one dish. Trick is to mix everything together to make one delicious bite."}
{"text":"We are in town visiting friends so decided to try this place out they had gone to before and said was pretty good. We got he picada and bandeja paisa and then we got some empanadas, pandebono and buñuelos to all try out. Everything from the bakery was nice and warm however not much of a selection compared to other bakeries we have gone to. The food was great in portions and decently seasoned. The service however was really slow and not much attentive."}

There is still hope to find some Authentic Colombian and Latin American Food in Toronto! Mi Tierra gave me hope.... As I tasted their Hot Sauce which was so spicy...hot...and left me with this burning sensation!  Sancocho ($5.99) -  A traditional Latin American soup, made with chunks of beef, green plantain and casava - Really light and tangy broth  Arepa con Sausage ($4) - One of the best Arepa and Sauage I ate in Toronto to date! - moist and have wonderful bite and so flavourable  Bandeja Tipica ($11.99)  - A traditional Colombian dish of grilled beef, beans seasoned with sauteed tomatoes and maduro (fried plantain) chicharron (bacon) and rice topped with a fried egg - I felt I might be in a food coma if I ate the whole plate by myself - Fried pork was fatty and tender, cripy outside and soft inside - Steak was cooked well, marinated with just the right flavoured and not overcooked or dry at all!  Brevas Con Queso ($3.50) - Figs And Cheese  - Traditional Colombian dessert - Figs and Cheese never my first choice for dessert but it was surprising good!  Mi Tierra's decor is loud, colourful and right in your face! The waitresses are friendly and smiley. I really felt like I was dining in one of those little family restaurants in Central America!
