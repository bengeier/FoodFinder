{"text":"It's good chinese take out - plain and simple. I have tried a variety of things and I'm never disappointed. For takeout places it's 5 stars, but I'll leave it at 4 stars because it is a take out place :)"}
{"text":"Great, friendly, quick delivery. I will order again. The gentleman who answered the call and took our order was upbeat and friendly as was the delivery driver. The phone was hot and delicious when it arrived. Really recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food, but I've been more impressed with this place than any. My boyfriend is fixated on Chinese any time we have takeout and each time I dread the meal, finding each one expensive, mediocre and far too much, which would be an attribute if the food were good reheated, but it isn't. This last time he suggested Ming Garden. Directly following my eye-roll, I read Yelp reviews and agreed to try it. Delivery was fast, food was relatively inexpensive and it was the tastiest Chinese meal I've had in Champaign. Now, I claim not to be an expert on Asian food and fully realize this is likely not authentic cuisine, but I used the adjective TASTY, not culturally significant. It's delicious. That's my top priority here. I had the sweet and sour chicken, chicken egg roll and chicken fried rice. Though the rice contained large onions, which I'm not keen on, the material around the onions was the best fried rice I may have ever had."}
{"text":"I first discovered this hidden gem in 1994. I think the menu hasn't changed since. I'm positive it's the best kept secret in champaign. It's delivery or carry out only and I suppose that's one reason and it's kind of dingy inside but man the food is good. Not high brow enough for some I suppose but I hope it's here for another 20 years. Anyway give it a try."}
{"text":"I'm so shocked by the tone of some of these reviews! This is Huntersville, not Beverly Hills, and there exists a strong need for a \"get over yourself\" convention here apparently. This is typical Chinese takeout.  It's exactly what a normal person would think it's going to be.  The staff do their jobs, which doesn't include making customers feel like Will & Kate.  You're gonna get what you expect as long as you intend to eat vs. get an ego boost or expect Imperial service."}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant and one of the best Chinese ones around the lake. I recommend the orange chicken or sweet and sour chicken. The only thing I would fix is the customer service. Every time I call in, I get the same saying of \"what you want.\""}
{"text":"Always ordering from here. The only negative experience ive had is usually when i place an order through the phone and they seem a bit annoyed when i cant understand them. Which sometimes makes me not want to call back but overall the food is great."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food ever. We are regulars and every time we order it juts gets better. Inexpensive and super fast delivery 
John
Had them deliver again last night 4/21 and many times since my review. Fantastic food!!!!!
Thank you"}
{"text":"We order from Ming Garden whenever we want Chinese food because they deliver which is nice.  Our top two favorites in the area don't deliver. FYI Ming Garden is amazingly fast at delivery.  One time our meal arrived 20 minutes after we ordered.  

Their food is just average but their portions are a good size.  It reminds me of mall food court chinese.  

Definitely try them if you are looking for delivery."}
{"text":"NEVER CALL TO PLACE A DELIVERY ORDER!!! I've given this place two chances at making my order experience acceptable. Both times the same lady, who can barely speak English, argues with me loudly. I try to tell her my address is 1606, she replies 606?!? \"NO 1-6-0-6!!!\" This goes on for about five minutes and STILL both times the delivery guy called me while at the door of 606, so Ive had to explain to him the difference between 606 and 1-6-0-6!!! Then actually placing the order is ridiculous because of the incompetence of the order taker. It takes another 15 minutes to argue with the lady about my order and try to get it right. Then when thats all over she shouts at me \"$28.95!!!\" When, according to the menu they gave me, it should have only been $19.95. $9 DELIVERY CHARGE?!?  I try to ask the delivery man why I was charged $9 extra and he tried to pull a fast one by saying \"ooo new menu!\" I told him the new menu is the same one i have and tried to go through our order with him adding it up with him while he mumbles \"uuhhh chicken fry rice $2!\" Which makes no sense seeing as its $4 on their menu and factored into my calculations
He said nothing about a delivery fee and I finally got fed up and handed over $30
I asked him for a receipt and he handed me a piece of paper with Chinese written all over it that could have said \"F**k You American!\" for all I know
I originally ordered from this place because of the decent prices but that was a LIE!!!
I tried to give them another chance and they failed.
I tore up both \"new menus\" they gave me and NEVER AGAIN WILL BE ORDERING FROM THEM!
The food wasnt impressive enough to put up with their crap.
If you want to order from this place I suggest physically going in, getting a paper menu, and circling what you want...but i havent tried that....they still might try to argue with you over price.
And considering they ONLY do carry out or delivery they SUCK AT THEIR JOB!!!"}
{"text":"Carry out or delivery only.  Small basic business.  Food was ready in ten minutes and was VERY reasonably priced.  It was very good and tasty.  Excellent value for the money.  Will enjoy again."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this tucked-away place by chance while driving by and decided to give it a chance. We each ordered a lunch special (only $4.55 each). For the food quality and generous portions, this place is inexpensive.

The orange chicken was heavier with the orange than most other Americanized Chinese places, which was a nice change of pace from some others we've tried. The general Tso's (ordered extra spicy) was a little softer and heavier on the soy sauce than most others I've tried, but still quite good. My husband, having more of a taste for soy than me, found this a positive quality and liked it far more than most others he's had.

The specials came with pork egg rolls and these were simply phenomenonal! They were very crispy and had distinct vegetable and pork flavor in the contents rather than the usual wilted salty mush found many other places.

We'd also ordered some pork lo mein, which were on par. The fried rice with the specials was admittedly a little bit dry, but otherwise perfectly fine.

About $20 for the approximately three meals each of good eats? We'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I am really starting to like this restaurant. Quite a few years ago, I had a bad experience with sketchy meat and poor taste and quality. I tried again and was pleasantly surprised. Meat that I could identify. ( I have managed food service establishments for over 15 Years) My food was hot fresh and ready in 15 minutes. I am a big fan of lo mein and theirs' was amazing. I included pics for you. The chicken was crispy and flavorful. I will order again!"}
{"text":"When it comes to cheep Chinese takeout, their food tastes good but their service is horrible! I come here often and usually have no problem but today, I ordered two orders of orange chicken and one order of mixed vegetables with orange sauce. They got my order completely wrong and I ended up going home with nothing that I wanted. My friends and I came back after realizing that we had received a completely wrong order and were told that it was our fault. It was really unfair that we had to pay for three meals that we ended up not eating."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. They deliver which is awesome. The delivery time is always fast and the drivers are friendly. The women who works the front counter is a little matter of fact and standoffish but never rude or mean. I think she just works to much cause she is always there. The food is pretty good. Some things are way better then others. My fav there is the pad Thai mei-fun. By far the best in the area. If you order the standard items you may be disappointed but they do make allot of good dishes so you just have to stray away from the combo dinner cheeseburger menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in champaign! Their orange chicken and crab ragoon is the best! I only give it 3 stars because its in a bad location and the place itself is kinda dirty!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese food anywhere around the lake. I have tried it two times now and it is extremely disappointing. Food is bland and the customer service is terrible. It is just basic standard run-of-the-mill Chinese food, minus a few points."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Huntersville hands down.....except their egg rolls. Their egg rolls are pretty bad, but everything else I've tried has been absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for a long, long time and I've never gotten ill from their food or served anything inedible or ever sketchy.

I know that's a pretty low standard, but considering the shape and notorious lack of cleanliness associated with mom & pop Chinese shops I think that's worth a mention. 

There are about half a million Asian folks and an equal number of Asian eateries in Chambana. So there are certainly finer and more.....interesting joints out there especially if you aren't looking for \"Americanized\" food. But, this is always my first choice for carry out.

Best dumplings, egg rolls, egg foo yung, generals chicken, sesame chicken, orange chicken and look mein I've ever carried out. It's consistent, tasty, always piping hot, a great value and always ready in \"tin minit\""}
{"text":"Great, simple, inexpensive and lightening fast!! Really nice job with white rice. Good and sticky. Highly recommend for delivery."}
{"text":"Moved down from the Big Apple where there are thousands of Chinese restaurants. So I'm pretty picky. 
I never get delivery but they do deliver.
The person on the phone took my order and got it right. He said 15 minutes and was right on the money.
Wonton soup was very good.
Large order of ribs is very good. They were cooked very well and VERY meaty. They were also very soft so easy to eat.
The dinner combo- General Chicken, that's what they call also good. We order all white meat chicken, $1 extra. There wasn't an abundance of breading on it so we could taste the chicken.
The egg roll wasn't bad but nothing to write home about. It's too small to split. Not worth fighting for.
We asked for the fried rice which was ok but seemed like just brown rice. I guess we should have said pork in it.
The meal was very good, will definitely frequent this place."}
{"text":"Not good for Dining In

Been here twice.  Once for Dining In the other for Carry Out. There are only a a limited number of tables but don't worry, most are never occupied.  From what I can see, most of their business is carry out.

First time I tried the Seafood Delights and it was not bad but not great either. Very skimpy on the scallops and the veggies were cooked to a mush.

Take out the second time and it was Chicken with Walnuts and had no taste of texture.

Very bland food and to get any flavor, don't use the sauces with any type of moderation.

Very luke warm presentation, sort of like the Subway of Chinese Food.

Would not recommed."}
{"text":"I ordered here last night to have it delivered. There was a wait time of approximately an hour. It got to my house in 30 minutes. The sesame chicken was really good. Hot. Fresh. A ton of chicken. The fried rice didn't have any veggies in it which is what you expect from most Chinese places, but the rice was good too. I also ordered crab Rangoons and the sauce to go with it. It was all soooo good! I'm very pleased with the quickly service and yummy food I got last night!"}
{"text":"Okay, here is the deal.  I have been had Ming Garden at least 12 times over the past year.  I gave it a three, just because it is either really awesome or just plain sucks.   I get General T chicken or Cashew Chicken and my wife gets Hot and Spicy Shrimp House Lo Mein.  She always loves her dish and when mine sucks, I will eat off her plate.

They have delivery, which is nice for my late night Chinese fix."}
{"text":"Lack of customer service. A little bit snippy when asked questions. Ordered 2 egg rolls take out. While waiting I viewed the menu. Found prices a bit higher than most other Chinese places. When I opened order, no duck sauce or napkin in bag. Egg roll was bland and soggy. Very much like a frozen super market taste. Few drinks available, only 16 oz. Store could use a good cleaning. Cooks should be wearing hair nets and clean uniforms. Would not order or walk in there again."}
{"text":"We ordered from here and they messed up our order.  When we called to let them know, the woman argued with us that it was what we had ordered.  Ridiculous treatment when it was a simple error.  So much for the kids getting what they wanted for dinner...wow."}
{"text":"I really like it. The portions are good sized and the food is DELISH! I especially like the House Egg Fu Young, with pork, beef and shrimp. The sauce is amazing. However...DO NOT MESS WITH THE FRIED RICE....it's boring, dry yellowed rice...period...Absolutely no reason to call it fried rice. I'm assuming the meat fried rice is probably actual fried rice. I'll have to try that sometime."}
{"text":"Walked up to the door and glanced at the menu taped to the glass. There was a dead bug squished between the menu and the glass. I turned around and went home."}
{"text":"I didn't even want tob put one star. Food isn't good, and the customer service is even worse"}
{"text":"This is pretty much your standard run-of-the-mill Chinese food joint. Best for lunch - spend around $5 for a more than filling meal in an environmentally unfriendly styrofoam takeout box. Dinners are at least twice the price though so I'd advise strongly against it. Watch out for the chairs. We found a broken one that was ready to eat my girlfriend alive. Staff is generally friendly and helpful. They have the usual tip bucket that pressures you to feel required to leave a tip. At places like this just remember it really is not required. No need to feel that pressure. To wrap it up, I was just having a need for a Chinese trash food fix on the weekend and this place was walking distance from home."}
{"text":"Their $5 lunches are great!  Fast and really ONLY $5 even if you call ahead and pick up."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, delivery was quick. Food arrived hot and fresh. Delivery charge was like $1.50. Probably the best Chinese delivery in this area, for sure. I'd definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've found since moving from NJ. Chicken and broccoli I've gotten elsewhere is never good, and finally I found a place that gets it right! The only bad thing was the fried rice. It seemed like they used their leftover rice from the day before since it wasn't soft rice and seemed stale and old. So don't order the fried rice, but other than they... delivery was great and chicken and broccoli was great!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese! We order from here every time we get Chinese and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Because Ming Garden is one of the few for delivery in the area, I REALLY wanted to love it! Unfortunately I don't necessarily think the food at Ming Garden has a lot of flavor.  I am all about a divey Chinese place, but I just don't think this is it!  We were trying something closer to home as we typically go with NY Restaurant in Cornelius, and I have to say that Ming Garden just didn't compare...sorry!"}
{"text":"Carryout only.  Best Chinese takeout in the area right now.  The Singapore Angel Hair  actually had curry flavor.  Friendly staff, too.  The food  looks good and tastes better."}
{"text":"I'm not a Beverly Hills trixie that likes to order off the menu at Spago, but I did want some scallops specially added to the normal Mongolian Chicken (trying to get a bit more seafood in me.) I made it clear while asking, that I understood I would be charged more money. The ten year old taking my order came back from the kitchen with a rebuke in tote of \"no, sorry.\" It sounded like I asked them to calculate the intercept tangent of the derivative to a elliptical satellite orbit of Venus.

The lobby was indeed dirty.

The Chicken Teriyaki was too vegetable laden and bland.

This is gringo Chinese that's not even pulled off right. Go to Green Jade up the road.

Thanks"}
{"text":"Great, greasy hole in the wall Chinese place.  Get delivery because you don't want to see the building."}
{"text":"I love their Chinese food. The hot and sour soup might be a tad to hot but other than that its the best I have found in the area.  So far I have enjoyed everything I have tried. They also I believe deliver.  I would  like the staff to be a bit more friendly but  hey it is what it is."}
