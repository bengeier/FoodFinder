{"text":"Always good food and if you buy a burrito today and next week they will be the exact same size and quality. The sauces here are friggin amazing be sure to try their spicy guacamole salsa its to die for! As a bonus, there are very beautiful women working there"}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a new 24hr mexican food place open near me. The restaurant itself is pleasing to the eyes with all the vibrant colors and menu. Unfortunately, the food does not have the same attention to detail as the looks for this place.   I ordered a simple carne asada burrito and horchata. The carne asada was okay (a bit on the greasy side) but the beans in the burrito were beyond salty along with the rice. I had to hide the salty flavor with lime and salsa. Though, the red salsa was also over powered by salt. The horchata was way to sweet and had a thick consistancy to it. I ended up taking a few bites of my burrito and a few sips from the horchata before tossing them away.  I really had my hopes up for this place but it just fails to meet its expectations."}

{"text":"This restaurant has great food. My kids loved it and kept saying how delicious they thought it was. Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Just tried this place the food was very good , the chips and salsa was nice , they were quick to bring our meal out to us . I agree with one of the other comments they don't seem to like to bring you refills we will be returning to this place.i ate the court house dinner it ,it was a awesome burrito with cheese and pineapple slices on top my girlfriend had a fajitas and she thought it was very good."}
{"text":"Food is fairly tasty, but get it to go. We had street tacos (nothing special) and California Burritos (better, with excellent tortillas).   The small tent with picnic tables offers a cacophony of competing loud TV (2 different) and music. Dreadful. The food was very hot and fresh, so taking it home or somewhere more pleasant is the better option."}
{"text":"Whenever Em In The mood for a good Burrito...i come here...there's alot of good Mexican Restaurants here in Phoenix..and this one is one of them."}
{"text":"We had been to this location prior to it becoming Salsita's with negative outcomes. Our experience tonight was excellent!!! We ate on a Friday around 5 pm. We were so impressed! Clean, neat atmosphere. Polite service, other than waiting to get our check.  We had our two young kids with us and when they said it was delicious I knew we were on the right track! The restrooms were very clean! ( extra important when you have kids!) Our meals came out quickly, and I will be recommending this place to anyone with kids! Every parent knows one of the nightmares of eating out with kids is the wait time between sitting down and feeding your face...which seems to drag on when you have starving kids who won't sit still. This was absolutely not the case tonight!  My husband had the enchilada sampler and said every type was delicious. I had the chicken enchiladas and I was very happy with how great the quality of the chicken was! My kids had cheese quesadilla and tacos with beans and rice. We all enjoyed everything. The salsa is perfect too, for me at least. Good flavor without spice. I'm sure they have spicier options but I didn't look.  Also we didn't interact with him much but the manager was around and was so genuinely nice. He looks like Fred Armisen. Go see for yourself!"}
{"text":"The servers are all very nice, kitchen is very quick and the atmosphere is friendly. The bar has multiple TVs for watching a game or sit in the restaurant for a more private feel. The homemade chips and salsa are yummy. Prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Crawled into this place after coming off a binge, (won't say what, but I was zombie status) craving some soup, I was tempted by the super nachos, asada nachos they call it, if your not familiar with super nachos, it's a big plate of messiness, chips beans guacamole sour creme cheese pico meat salsa. A bunch of shit all combined to make your nachos super. I ordered that and a shrimp cocktail, shrimp cocktail was ok, they don't have tapatio there, I need tap with my cocktail, so it wasn't as good to me, but this is my substitute for my filibertos super nachos. Also stopped in for a burrito another day, and was happy I did. They are open late and conveniently close to home, stop by if your as unsatisfied with fili b's as I was."}
{"text":"Only been here twice -- both times the food was very good & plenty, service was friendly, quick & attentive, and the prices very reasonable.  Have tried a few other 'Mexican' places in the area, so far this is the wife's fave.  And the soundtrack was interesting, too."}
{"text":"Love ! Always fresh ingredients , really authentic flavor , and we love the flan , horchata , rolled tacos and the carne asada fries are BOMB . The people are really friendly and always smiling"}
{"text":"Salsitas is a different style of mexican food (San Luis de Potosi/Michoacan) . I thought the beans and rice were delicious! I've had the chili rellenos, they were good but could've had more cheese inside, the sauce on top had very good flavor.  The carne asada torta was good and it was two meals for me. The carne asada should be chopped up because it was to tough to bite through. But, otherwise my experience was great. Service was great and they were extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible, they take to long, they give you the order wrong, they don't give you what you need to eat and drink your meal."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The \"mulita\" was a burnt tortilla with big asada chunks full of fat and a lot of cabbage. Didn't even finish it. They have no idea what a mulita is. Taco Bell $1 quesadilla would have been better. Soggy fries and tomatoes in the California burrito."}
{"text":"Second best food truck in the area, not telling you where the best one is!   Homemade, authentic stuff and it's good."}
{"text":"Miller rd location.  Great mex truck. Everything I have had has been very good. Pastor tacos are my favorite. Menudo on weekends. Open early for breakfast."}
{"text":"Service was not good, food was bland. Salsa was delicious! Place was very clean and orderly.  I just wasn't wowed by the restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food. One of the best in the Stow area.  I usually get the enchiladas super rancheros and have had their fajitas. We always have a good experience here."}
{"text":"Food flavor ok, but serving sizes are very poor.  Price is average.  However, I have eaten at this Salsitas place 3 times and every time the serving size is minimum.  I do not recommend this place at all.  I can upload pics so you can understand why I do notrecommend this place."}
{"text":"The lady with the tattoos is so unfriendly and never smiles or says Thank You!"}
{"text":"Use to be one of my favorites... the customer service has become atrocious. The person taking my order seemed angry and I had to ask for my 6 cents in change, I guess I was expected to just give to them. I would have if the woman hadn't scowled so much at me. I'll find another place to grab tacos- don't need food with bad energy!"}
{"text":"Can't take orders properly and wouldn't give me a refund after I honestly did not like the food."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go eat tacos. I go there every Tuesday with my friends.   The perfect order is 5 tacos de trompo and a medium horchata."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised that my friend told me that the Mexican food in Phoenix was meh at best. Definitely not what I was expecting to hear given that there is a decent amount of Mexican people in Phoenix.  Welps, after coming here, I can see why he said that. Got some carne asada/al pastor fries...eh, it was functional at best since I was starving and was ok with decent enough Mexican food. Neither the carne asada nor al pastor were particularly spectacular.  Good enough...that's about all I have to say."}
{"text":"I usually go here n there ! But when I do go there's always a lady that is so rude! I mean she could always greet people politely and with a smile ? Let's work on that .. either than that bomb as Fortas I would definitely give 5 starts to there kitchen staff tho"}
{"text":"Great service. Clean. Excellent food, not soggy or greasy. Love it!!"}
{"text":"There is no doubt that the late night crew here treats the customers MUCH BETTER than the manager Angie does.  I've been coming here nearly daily since I came to the area, and I usually order the carnitas plate. I like to get some of the pork fat with my carnitas. That's the best part.  However, this Angie lady, who I have been told is the manager, refuses to let me have any of the pork with the fat. I don't understand why, but she seems to have something against me.  I was treated so badly today, I will probably not be going back again. There's no corporate number or anything that I can call to address my concerns on how I was treated, and every restaurant I called, everyone who answers won't speak English, and then hangs up on me.   Again I say, the night crew is MUCH BETTER at how they treat the customers. I'm specifically talking about this ANGIE person, as being the one who didn't want my business. It's a shame really, I used to like going there to eat."}
{"text":"Second time here and once again they screwed up my order. First time here I ordered a carne asada burrito with \"No beans or rice\" I got home and nothing but beans and rice. Today was my second time here I ordered the same thing only this time instead of a burrito like I ordered they gave me a \"Torta\", which is nothing even close to a burrito -_-......"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for no other reason than we were hungery. Never heard of this place. Very glad we did. The food was fresh, tasty and well prepared. Very authentic mexican food. Loved the tacos and the quesadillas. Appreciate the choice of sauces and condiments. I enjoyed watching my food being made. I have been back twice since and will continue to stop when in the area."}
{"text":"Our favorite local Mexican restaurant. Great diversity in the menu. I like the number of items with   chorizo."}
{"text":"Good mexican food w traditional sonara selection,the tortas are by far the best I ever had.they are big and grilled like paninis,they come with lays chips,weird but its a college town,they set up the inside like chipoltle so its easy for them drunk kiddies to get no pico on thee burro,because like filisquirtos they always forget,im sold on this place as of now,stay gold."}
{"text":"Overall, it was your typical Mexican restaurant, good food with your typical menu options. They do make their margaritas very strong, and I approve of that. Also, the service was incredibly friendly and quick. Honestly, I probably would have just given them a 3 star, but the service was so good I think it deserved a bump up. The only negative is the very colorful sign on the outside, looks a little more like a daycare center than a Mexican restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Not great.  Some mediums and some lows:  Ceviche - not that great.  Fish was kind of mealy and not seasoned well. Beef Tacos - the beef was VERY dry, some of it completely dry.  Seasoning was not noticeable. Carne Asada - decently seasoned, and not dry.  Nothing memorable though. Chips and Salsa Bar - the best part.  Several different kinds of salsa, including a tomatillo/avocado, a \"spicy\" red, and a \"smokey\" red. Tacos al Pastor - not that good. Rice and refried beans - standard fare, nothing to make them stand out.  I do like that they used Mexican crema for the sour cream.  All in all, qualifies as a \"Never Again\" stop.  P.S.  Had three co-workers with me, and none of them liked it either."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food truck in the state. The burritos are exciting and flavorful. The meat is perfect  On the weekend, the pork is slow roasted literally  right in front of you. Would recommend the California burrito."}
{"text":"I love their tacos.  I have been here a few times throughout the years and I have been a fan since the beginning.  I was there a few weeks ago and they had tacos al pastor and they were awesome.  The only other place I can get those are at the American Taco Shop (good but nothing special) but I have to say that these are the best.  They are flavorful and they give you some of those burnt ends where all the flavors is located.  Loved them"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Best drinks! The food is great as well especially if you're in need of a late night snack."}
{"text":"Passing through on a road trip staying at the Marriott across the street..best Chicken Fajita Quesadilla I have ever had! Everyone,including kids, enjoyed their food. Great lime margarita too."}
{"text":"I was shopping up a storm one day and I needed to wet my whistle but I didn't want a soda so I came to Salsita's for a fresca pina colada.  I'm so addicted to these drinks now.  I will drive 15 miles out of my way to get one.  I've tried to get my fix at other Salsita's but this place must have a secret recipe because I'm telling you kids, its freaking delicious!  I've actually never eaten here so I can't vouch for the food - just that pina colada."}
{"text":"I got a California burrito and it was aaaaaamazing! If you are driving through definitely come stop by. Such a yummy food truck."}
{"text":"Salsitas is awesome! whether dining in or carry out its always good. Something about their rice that is addictive. Put some of their fresh shredded cheese on it with sourc cream and salsa and I am one happy girl. We always start with the chorizo sausage and cheese appetizer, sooooo good! I get the Stow special that has a ton of shrimp in it, so yummy and it comes with that rice. My husband gets the Chori Pollo and never strays from that. And you must get the frozen margaritas of course. They always have coupons out which kinda makes me feel bad because it's already cheap enough. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Had nachos, surprised on the amount and flavor. Will go back. They are a little pricey but always busy so you know they are good."}
{"text":"The tacos and salsas are decent. The meat seems to be of decent quality. The customer service is terrible. It took like 15 minutes to get my Michelada and the place was empty. The miche had too much clamato and bitters. Tacos and miches are just okay."}
{"text":"So happy we gave this place a chance. They weren't very busy. But that had nothing to do with the quality of their food. Very clean with a very attentive staff. The food is amazing. If you have the chance don't skip this place it'll be worth it. The Falls Stow special burrito is an amazing deal."}
{"text":"Stale chips and $7 burrito???!! No thank you. I'd rather have food from the Roach coach"}
{"text":"We went with some friends, and we had been there before, my fianc√© likes it, but today the customer service was brutal. The cashier had a horrible attitude plus there was a hair in my food which made me gag. I took back the plate and they didn't even apologize for it. I was a bad experience. I probably payed about 35 roughly. For two people! So yeah...."}
{"text":"It is a joke how much meat they put in their tacos and burritos.  They are also over priced and what we did get to taste was so disappointing. Don't waste your money on this place keep driving."}
{"text":"Party of five.  Seated right away, drinks right away.  Three meals were served and 1/2 gone before the last two meals were served.  FOOD WAS BLAND.  NO SPICES - BORING.  Waiter seemed to be in a rush with us - he asked how is everything and before I looked at everyone to see if they needed anything - waiter was gone.  Slow on ice tea refills.  Bill came quick.    WILL NEVER TRY SALSITAS AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great !! Love the location they have good music fast service and they hook it up good job!!!"}
{"text":"This is your typical good Mexican restaurant, however much better than the previous Mexican joint that used to be in this spot before they went under.. They have authentic everything, just about. Quesadillas are good, guacamole and queso dip also! Good queso is key to a good \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant, right? The staff is very friendly, the owner is very attentive, always smiling with a genuine attitude towards his customers, happy that you're there. I work just down the street from here so we often come here for lunch, and they happily take our orders over the phone or fax the menu to us directly so we have the menu handy. Very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Mexican restaurants have converged toward nearly identical menus, layouts, and styles.  Thus, the only differentiator between Mexican restaurants is service quality.  If you're in the Northern Cuyahoga Falls/ Stow area, do not go to El Rancho Mexican Restaurant on State Rd.  They have very poor customer service.  Despite my boyfriend and I going at an odd-hour, we received very lazy service (few drink refills, no checking on us, etc..).  Instead of dining at El Rancho, head to Salsas on Steels Corners road, a few blocks away.  This Salsitas location is relatively new as of this post.  Thus, the restaurant has fewer customers than the original Salsas in Kent, OH.   Our water was excellent. Despite being the only worker for 5 full tables, he performed well. He constantly was refilling our drinks, giving us napkins (without asking us first), giving helpful recommendations on spice levels, and frequently checking on us.  If you go on a Saturday, look for our waiter. He had a fully shaved head, taller stature, and was incredibly sweet. We forgot to get his name though.  Excellent service, cheap food (for the relatively high quality), and lack of the usual smell of a Mexican restaurant - our clothes did not smell afterwards! - turns this Salsas location into a 5/5 for all Mexican restaurants, which says a lot considering how many we've been to!  P.S. Just to clarify a menu problem we had. If you order a 'beef fajita', you will receive steak strips. If you order 'beef nachos', you will receive ground beef on top of chips. Remember to clarify that you want the steak strips on the nachos."}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood burrito, best I have ever had. They substituted my rice and beans with a side salad."}
{"text":"Yessss! The tacos are to die for and the lemonade they make everyday... hand squeezed and it's so yummy! Def a pregnancy craving of mine"}
{"text":"This place was super quick and cheap. The tacos were not bad, not the best I've ever had but for the price definitely cannot complain. The service was great and would come back again for some late night Mexican food"}
{"text":"I used to love this place went last weekend.  It was burnt and dry I'll never return!!!"}
{"text":"Salsitas is a HUGE step up from the disgusting and poorly managed KFC that was here before it, and while I couldn't be more happy to have a new Mexican joint near my house, there's really nothing amazing about it. The carne asada is about on par with most of the \"bertos\" around town, the portions are a little smaller than Filibertos, and the prices are about what you would expect. The only above average thing is their hot sauce, it's smokey and wonderful. I'll certainly be back, I like to spread my Mexican food love around the town, but they opened right next to a Filibertos, a bold move and all, but I just like Filis more."}
{"text":"Its close to work. Food is ok.  They have unlimited chips and salsa bar. Good little place. Price is ok. Worth a try"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Salsitas tonight and we are big fans.  As others have said, the service is excellent and the food is very good; excellent for a neighborhood restaurant.  My wife had the taco salad with steak and I had the carnitas with salsa verde.  Both were excellent; their salsa verde is particularly good.  Nice looking place too; everything was clean and brand new.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was just barely acceptable and only because the majority of it was edible. I had the special combo plate and only recognized the taco. The enchilada, burrito, and especially chile relano were unrecognizable. Their burrito and enchilada was just ground beef wrapped in a tortilla with nothing else and the sauce on top was just barely above ketchup. Their Mexican tacos were the closest to authentic but still lacked flavor and they didn't provide the proper toppings. Lastly the salsa was good, but it lacked any sort or spice. They need a Mami Juanita in the kitchen putting love and authenticity to their food.  Only excellent thing about here was our server, he was top notch and very friendly. The price wasn't too bad either."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if I could give it NO stars then I would have done that. Moving on to the review.... So my coworkers and I head here for lunch today..go in check out the menu which is quite small and limiting but whatever..decide to order a bacon breakfast burrito..go up to counter and ask if it has potatoes in it.. the girl replies with yes and I say \"okay good\" order my burrito/ drink (side bar -- they have their drinks behind the counter and I had to wait for the girl to finish taking the rest of lines order to get my drink..annoying but okay). The three people im with all order AFTER me and then ALL get their food. Im waiting..waiting.. after about 10 ish minutes and my friends PLUS all the people after me getting their food I go up and ask where my burrito is...they all look around at each other and are like \"ummmm we accidentally gave it to a car in the drive thru\" so my first thought is...IF YOU REALIZE THIS WHY DIDNT YOU MAKE ANOTHER ONE!? Whatever. The worst is yet to come. Get my burrito..yes, its piping hot. So I take a bite..hmm no potatoes and by being the freak I am; I then decide to open it up and look...nope, no potatoes. Roll it back up and decide to eat it because im starving. Well after about 2 bites grease just comes POURING out..im not talking a little bit a grease..a TON of it!! I have ate at Filly's/ Los Favoritos/Someburros all these kind of places and NEVER HAVE EVER ON ANYTHING experienced SO MUCH GREASE. I put down the burrito and my hands were covered in grease, my napkins, plate. Too disgusting to eat. So by now all my friends are done anyways and I just threw it away. It was only 5 bucks...but they will never get my 5 bucks again. Also, I was talking to a seperate co-worker on my way out of the office about this place and she said there was one by her house but it closed down! Should have taken it as a sign......... NEVER AGAIN! Another thing, if you were wondering......my other friends that did not have my experience got rolled tacos, tacos and a torta.. the general consensus was that it was meh. Not worth going back for."}
{"text":"The lady (tattoos on her hand) working the drive thru is extremely rude. She was rude taking my order and soon as she gave me my food SLAMS the window. I knocked on the window and told her if she could give me extra salsa since I only got 1, for two burritos. She rolls her eyes. You lost a customer"}
{"text":"Girlfriend picked us up some Al Pastor street tacos while out getting groceries.....these are some of the best if not THE BEST Al Pastor street tacos I have ever had. Meat was fresh and tasted amazing and the cilantro, onions and tortillas were all fresh. The salsas come in a bag which is funky but they taste great and the homemade beans are amazing. Awesome food truck :)"}
{"text":"Asada fries are probably the only good thing here lol honestly... the lady at drive thru is very polite so that's a plus for me"}
{"text":"I am a regular at salsitas. Usually on Monday and Tuesday's because who doesn't love $1.99 margaritas? Excellent food, love the staff. Killer lunch specials. Usually go with the salsitas fajita."}
{"text":"This has become our go-to Mexican restaurant. I love Mexican food but my wife, not so much. But since trying Salsitas, she actually suggests Mexican, and we come here 2-3 times a month. It's hard to put a finger on why it's so good, as the menu is very similar to other similar restaurants in the area. The food just seems to be fresher, more flavorful, and always served hot. The \"hot\" salsa is killer and the regular is packed with flavor."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food gets more and more expensive. I only came here because my daughter insisted and she doesn't understand the value of a dollar just yet. I'm done with this place, is anybody can recommend a better soft street taco place please let me know"}
{"text":"Went there with friends tonight, my first time there. I ordered the Seafood burrito dinner with rice and black beans! It was delicious! The burrito had a nice mango salsa on top,  just the right combination of flavors!  The service was great and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for good Mexican food in a casual atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is ok, the communication is terrible.  a few days ago was the 3 or 4th time i have come to this food truck on the side of the Jackrabbit Rd. just south of the I-10 freeway.  and each time I place an order they get it wrong. Its not that I get the wrong food item, but they make it the way they want and leave on items I have request not to have and dont add the items i requested to be added.  One may ask, then do I come back, and I say only because when I am working in the area, they are the only food place for miles.   Will i come back probably not, could i give a recommendation to this place no.  I do feel if you speak Spanish you will have better luck communicating with them overall."}
{"text":"This place rocks. We love Mexican food and always are looking for a new choice for our love. Stumbled across this restaurant one night. Food was great. Service was spot on. Would highly recommend this cantina to all. Get the chimichangas with pork. Total 10!"}
{"text":"I love coming in and getting the tripa burrito with everything. The staff are very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Salsitas which are usually good, but this one sucks. Six bucks for a.pollo asada borito that was pretty much beans and rice. What chicken there was had a funky smell."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick to-go order on our way home to Goodyear.  We ordered a burrito 'Pastor' and a carne asada quesadilla.  The burrito was fine, but the quesadilla had less than half the meat that it should have.  We called the place, and they offered us the option of driving back out there for either a refund or a new meal, which is fair, but it kinda defeats the purpose of picking up a to-go order, not to mention the gas consumption.  We told them we'd drive back tomorrow for a meal done right.  They initially agreed, but then called back, insisting that we drop what we're doing and come back now.  The second option was that we save the chintzy quesadilla and bring it back tomorrow.  So one of us skips dinner?  Granted, once in a while, people will try to scam an establishment, but a business needs to give the customer the benefit of the doubt the first time around.  To me, if I had a restaurant and complainers kept coming back and ordering and insisting on refunds, I'd be inclined to invite them to give their business to someone they like better.  This is not our case.  Just offering a heads up - check your meal before leaving.  Make sure they didn't skimp."}
{"text":"Was craving a gordita, but they don't make those at this food truck. What they DO have are sopes & huarachas....which are similar enough; just open-faced. The huarachas are slightly bigger than the sopes. I ordered sopes pork Chile verde. I believe those were $4.99. Those were delicious. My husband ordered carne asada huarachas ($6.99?)...and though they were good, I actually preferred the al pastor and pork chile verde better. They have street tacos, which I ordered with al pastor inside. The meat was good. I'd order more of those too. If you want chile/hot sauce, ask and they'll give you two bottles; one red and one green. Not spicy at all, but tastes good. Their horchata is good too. A little thicker (not super thick, mind you!), but that's probably because we got there early, so it wasn't watered down by ice yet. For those who don't speak Spanish....no worries! The younger lady with blonde hair speaks English.  So no excuses! Stop by and enjoy this truck stop. They get the food out to you in a timely manner. Have them for breakfast, and then try the next food truck spot a couple yards down.  Gotta share the love!"}
{"text":"Seems like every mexican restaurant serves the same bland food choices. Atmosphere is nice and staff is attentive, but they can't help the lack of food excitement. Probably will move on to somewhere else."}
{"text":"Will def be coming back here. Good food and great service. Standard chips and salsa. Kinda on chunky side.  I chose the cheese quesedia  and beef enchilada  asked for double rice no beans and was pleased order correct and food I was hot.   Fiance ordered burrito  enchilada  and rice and beans and he enjoyed his meal.  Prices were beyond reasonable and they have that Belly program which makes coming back even better and keep ya coming back."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. The best street style tacos I've had since living in Mexico."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Kent one. I discovered the Stow Salsitas one day when my girlfriend pointed it out. The food was delicious, and the service is good."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food. I've tried their tacos and tortas and they were pretty good. Staff is friendly! They have a tent with misters to keep you cool."}
{"text":"Not the best service but a wide variety of yummy Mexican food."}
