{"text":"Terrible, Terrible service. Menu looks great, but food was ok.. super salty. Still hydrating! Drinks not even close to how they are described. Sorry, wish I had better things to say.. remodeling is gorgeous!"}
{"text":"Don't ignore the poor reviews of this place like I did.  \"Sorry about that\" is the first thing said from the staff every time they come to the table.  The staff are friendly and polite but the service was extremely slow even while the restaurant is near empty.  Food has taken over 40 minutes to get here and a 2nd round of drinks took well over 15 minutes and 1 of 3 drinks didn't arrive.  Again, while the restaurant is near empty (5 tables and 2 at the bar with a wait staff of 3).  We had no silverware or napkins when our food came  out and had to go up to the bar to get our own.  Food was delicious: Our group had the Pastrami Panini, Shrimp Po Boy, Pierogi's and the Cranberry Apple Salad and loved them all except the salad.  They were worth the wait if you are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"After eating the fish and chips the next morning I experienced diarrhea, and vomiting. I'm pretty sure my food was under cooked, another person in my party ate the chicken wings, that we're also undercooked looking back now and experience the same food poisoning. Avoid this place!!! Unless you want to be in misery for the next couple days."}
{"text":"We asked to put on the Indians game 30 minutes go...

-this never happened

waitress tried to be funny..."}
{"text":"Because our first room at Four Points had not been cleaned, the hotel gave us two complimentary entrees at this restaurant in the hotel.  We read the reviews and we're discouraged.  But decided that we could tolerate a lot for free.  Glad we went.  We were promptly seated with silverware in hand by a very sweet waitress.  She took our drink orders and came back in a timely manner.  We got the chicken sandwich with fries as well as the perogies.  Both were excellent!  We both said we would eat here again."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel and had a few meals at The Hub.  I really enjoyed the food, especially the pierogis and three pig sliders. They have a pretty good breakfast as well, though I would note that they got two out of three meals wrong. You get quite a bit of food for the price. My only complaint is the slow service! The waitstaff are friendly but seem to enjoy hiding in the back more than taking your order. Every time I ate at the restaurant I waited approximately 10-15 min before someone acknowledged me to take my order. It seems you get better service if you sit at the bar, at least you get a drink right away though still waited a while to place a food order. Overall, I would recommend them because of their food but don't come if you are in a hurry (I witnessed many people get up and leave due to waiting too long). Ordering a to go order seems to be the way to go."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a bite to eat. I went there solo tonight to kill time and find something filling. I opted for the Shrimp Tacos which weren't that bad. The shrimp was tasty but the tortillas were kind of rubbery. The service was pretty speedy and one of the waitresses, Miranda, did an excellent job."}
{"text":"Your basic hotel bar. Plenty of tvs, but all showing the same thing. Bartender was pretty attentive for the crowd in there. Was not a fan of the food and actually got really sick after eating it (chicken sandwich and pretzels). No beer variety either. If you are in a pinch or don't want to leave hotel, it will do... but I'd recommend looking at other options."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Sheraton hotel and this is the in hotel restaurant. Nota terrible looking place but service is not good whatsoever.
I ate dinner and breakfast a few times during my week stay there. The food is terribly overpriced and the service should be much better. They are the most inattentive staff I have ever encountered. They bring you coffee and OJ and then provide you no silverware or even a menu. You wait until you wave down a server and ask for silverware and they just hand you a rolled napkin and silverware from the next table. Once they finally take your order you have completely finished the OJ and coffee but never come back to refill it until you ask them. 
It takes over 15 minutes to get your food and then you still have to ask for drink refills. The funny part is that the restaurant has only about 5 patrons at this time so what are they so busy doing that they cant even check on you once? 
I finished eating and of course am still waiting on the check and again, I have to wave down a server and ask for it. 
Unbelievable how they can charge so much for food and provide such garbage service. 
The food was not the best and was barely warm by the time I got it but it was convenient."}
{"text":"Attention to detail is not their strong point.  Provide specific requests for breakfast due to a dietary restriction, they don't listen.

Breakfast is basic.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Food was great and nice happy hour prices. Service was a bit slow, but server was very nice!"}
{"text":"Had the burger and it was really good. Service was quick and bartender very nice. I read the reviews and they were not good but found on this night they had it going on."}
{"text":"Hillary is awesome and the reason we came a second time.  First time ever to Ohio and love it already.  Very friendly people and pray it remains that way.  Thank you Hillary for your awesomeness."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Good decent menu. Good service. Got fish and chips... let's just say I had lots of leftovers and I usually take leftovers home but not this time"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The bartender spent more time smoking and in the bathroom than behind the bar. 

Food was terrible, I came back the second night because I'm staying in the hotel, the food was worse than the first night. How can a bar only stock 6 beers of one variety?  How can an employee not know how to run the POS system, then use the word \"Fuck\" when I ask for my ticket and waiting for 15 min to get my tab. 

Do yourself a favor and get something from the gas station next door. This place is a shit hole."}
{"text":"Service was great, we ordered food to-go and Dave was super friendly and still allowed us to order food even though the kitchen was closing in four minutes. Downside the food was terrible. The jerk wings smelled so bad we couldn't even stand to eat them and the mango habanero wings had absolutely no taste. Very disappointed in our experience at the Sheraton restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a nondescript looking hotel restaurant so I came in with low expectations, but I was impressed! The fried chicken sandwich was on really nice bread and was very good, accompanied by fresh-from-the-fryer seasoned steak fries. The waitress/bartender was really nice, and there were lots of TVs, so a great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"I gotta say I wasn't expecting it but they dropped the food bomb on me! I ordered the v for burger with some onion rings...while I waited I enjoyed an IPA during happy hot which was two dollars off and it was delish!  The food came out at the most appropriate amount of time it should have taken to prepare. First off it looked great and I could wait to see how it tasted. The onion rings were hands down the best I have ever had and the burger was more than I expected. Brioche bun, pickles, the feta that topped the burger was seared on the flat top quickly and the burger is self was flavorful with good consistency and structure (it didn't fall apart!!). The service was great and the overall experience was great. Stop in, don't let its hotel location stop you, it's great!!"}
