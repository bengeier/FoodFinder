{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing place, great service. The food is so god. Totally worth  the 15 minute wait (it goes by quickly) Employees are very friendly, the waiter was amazingly knowledgeable of the menu and even the drinks. (Forgot to get her name )
It was a great first time experience. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The decor is reminiscent of deep downtown Chicago but that's not the best part, ladies and gentlemen. This fine dining establishment is a diamond in the rough amidst Lakewood's overpopulated breakfast diners. Joe, the ever-compassionate man that he is, offers a dining experience like none other from the butter-dripping, mouth-watering pancakes, to the beautiful waiting staff. I give this restaurant a standing ovation; bravo!"}
{"text":"Good neighborhood place. I only get breakfast here, but the Legendary Breakfast Special is, well, legendary. Cheap, big, and delicious."}
{"text":"Today was the 4th time that I have been to Joe's. Every time I have gone I've got the chicken salad sandwich because it is so yummy! The portions here are ridiculously large. If you leave here hungry there's something wrong with you ha ha. My father-in-law has got the fish sandwich several times and today he tried to Gyro. He said they were both delicious. One of my favorite things with each meal is the huge pickle half!! Always a good flavor with a perfect crunch!!! The display case when you walk in the door filled with desserts, always looks delicious but I am always to stuff to try anything. One of these days I'm going to get something to go!!!"}
{"text":"Joe's Deli: 1.5/5 stars.*

Yet another Denny's clone, but somehow made even blander. The food is utterly devoid of anything resembling flavor, as if adding seasoning to anything (eggs, home fries, omelette) would give the clientele a heart attack. (And, judging by the average age of the people eating there, that is a distinct possibility.) The coffee tasted of chemicals. The service, however, was friendly. 

*If you like diner food, you might give poor Joe's 3/5."}
{"text":"I love a good deli and the Cleveland area is lacking this compared to other cities I have traveled.  Glad to find Joe's as it is a good deli.  On our trip today we had Corned Beef, Joe's Club and a Cheesesteak. All were very good and the portions are huge.  I'm not a big dude but can put away a sandwich with little effort. However, the Club was my lunch and dinner.  While the food was good and the service was very good as well, I do find it a bit overpriced for what we ordered.  The three items I listed plus three iced teas came to $56, plus a tip.  I spent $67 on three Samiches. A little pricy. I will probably return just not frequently."}
{"text":"I can understand why every time I come here there's a line out the door. People don't mind waiting for something they know is good and will ever disappoint and I can honestly say that's my experience every time at Joe's Deli. First off, you can tell the owner cares about hiring good people that will deliver exceptional service. Every waitress has always went above and beyond what was expected, always very kind, and most importantly - never felt rushed and like you're a bother. It's no surprise they had to expand and make a bigger restaurant, they are doing something right! Clean and nicely remodeled is the first impression I got of the place.

The food is amazing, especially for the price and amount you get. Everything is so flavorful. Last time I came here I got the California Chicken Club, which sounds like your basic sandwich that you can get anywhere but I've never had one this good! I don't get what they do to their Chicken that makes it so soft and moist?! The bacon is perfectly crisp, avocado was delicious, and the dipping mayo on the side was the perfect touch. I also tried my brothers gyro (so good) and my moms lentil soup (also very good). Basically what I'm trying to say is that I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. If you're ever in Rocky River or passing by, I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"It was pretty quiet when I checked this place out around 10am.  The decor is a little outdated...definitely kind of a dull environment.  My breakfast was okay.  I grabbed a chocolate chip cookie, it was good but so crumbly...I don't know what ingredient was missing (is it an egg?) but even if I touched it with one finger it would crumble.  I don't know why that bothered me so much lol but it did.  Service was decent and friendly.  I might go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is under new ownership!  They are always open now, 7 days a week until 3 pm and are going to be open in the evenings starting next month :) Finally,  a place to take the kids to dinner that isn't a typical Lakewood bar!

Excellent corned beef sandwiches and a really good breakfast special for only $3.95, everyday.  Plus reasonable lunch specials and homemade soups. Great service too, as the owner is always there.

Great neighborhood resteraunt,  a must try!"}
{"text":"Well one thing I learned is to call prior to visiting because these people choose when they want to work. My only complaint. Other than that, banging food. Been here a few time for breakfast and lunch and have left happy every time. They play good music if u like good music and the waitress is very nice. That is another thing I should add. Visiting this little diner style spot, you're sure to see the same faces every time u come in. Keep up the good work Joe's, just have more consistent hours..."}
{"text":"I'm updating my last review;my last post I was upset about them not including chips or some sort of side with a $10 sandwich for my to go order. While I still think it's a little high if that's still the case (which they may have changed), the food has been consistent. I've gone here mostly for breakfast and the food has been really good."}
{"text":"This place needs a sign that reflects the wonderful that's inside!  The plain sign reads, \"Joe's Subs\".  At a glance it looks more like a sign for a plumber or a paint shop.  And considering the fact that they are FAMOUS for their corned beef (which is not usually found in a sub, even in Cleveland) it should read Joe's Famous Corned Beef, or something to that effect.

Anyhow,

Next to us sat a 325 lb giant of a guy, and he was joyously eating a Reuben.  HE should be the sign out front.  We asked him what the joint was known for, and he said we were looking at it.  According to this friendly gentleman, Joe's serves over 4000 lbs of corned beef on St. Party's day ALONE.  He recommended anything with corned beef, and I wasn't about to argue with the guy.  2 Reuben's it was, and Joe's delivered 2 heart attack sized sandwiches to my friend and I, that can only be described as \"the lay of a lifetime\" nestled between 2 triangles of rye toast.  Absolutely amazing!

Also worth a nod was the hot tattooed Lebanese waitress/owner who stocked the kitchen with a bunch of hunk dudes, one being her boyfriend.  Way to go!  That's exactly how I would have done it, except in reverse.  The whole experience was a charm!

If they get a better sign, then I will put up a 5.  Don't even think about passing this place up while in Lakewood, it will turn anyone into a happy limey bastard, even if you happen to be a Lebanese goddess!

{"text":"Amazing! Food was wonderful so was the service! I ordered a bowl of soup and half sandwich and it was massive! The turkey and veggies and cheese on this sandwich was so fresh! French onion soup was pretty good too! This place is a gem and i would recommend to anyone. The corned beef is great and huge too!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. I have been to this restaurant very many times. These guys never miss a beat. All the food was excellent as well as the service and the workers are exceptionally nice. This is a great place to go always leave satisfied. Way to go Joe's deli you guys are all amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in cleveland. The food is great, big portions and very reasonably priced. Waitlist 10-15 mins but it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Rude folks at the front desk but good food!"}
{"text":"Good food. Honestly, I miss the old restaurant, but the food is spot on. Huge portions. Service is fine. The chicken soup is amazing! I always get extra to go!"}
{"text":"Ok I do love this place and have been coming to eat since the new owners took over and I always get good food .. UNTIL March 23, when my boss says lets get a few gyros and I will go to Joe's to get them so long story short I call the order in and ask for the sauce on the side.... Boss gets back to work with the gyros and i break the bag open to find no sauce on the side but  2 dill pickles instead. Ok so its to far away to go back and get the sauce for the gyros. Like i said before I do love this place but they were the worse gyros I have ever seen in my life. And the taste was god awful. I never seen round gyro meat, very little tomato very little onion and very little lettuce. The sandwich was not worth the 7 bucks they charge for it. If I hadn't been at work I would of went back with the gyro and complained and showed them why I was complaining,, No one can make me believe the  guy that owned the place or his wife made these sandwiches."}
{"text":"I learned that as a gay man my very being annoys some people so much they spend large sums of money and effort to admonish me one way or another. Not a day goes by I do not get up with a big smile realizing that fundamentalists, conservatives and the Pope are horrified that I did awaken in this world. It is unrecognized gay power. 

As a part time waiter years ago I found I had the power to get miserable customers to shout they would never come back. I simply gave deliberate and consistent poor service. And since I began reading yelp reviews I learned I have an additional power. Just by being a senior citizen I ruin dining experiences. How much fun that has added to my life. 

Both reviewers Maru H and Jeff P have given the senior warning alert for anyone considering to eat at Joe's. I sit proudly with my cohorts. We ended the draft and segregation. Brought equal pay and equal rights. History is filled with our accomplishments. In fact history is our accomplishments. 

This happens to be owned by the same family who owns Slyman's, Joe's in River, and Danny's Deli. Thus the corned beef and roast beef sandwiches are better than anybody's anywhere. I favor this particular location because the sandwiches are not so overstuffed and the prices are lowered accordingly. I have not tried the breakfasts but a word to the wise. Salt, pepper and hot sauce are available to spice up the food for those who complain that it is prepared for us old guys who cannot get enuff bland flavorless food."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I walked to this restaurant with average expectations. I was starving. I ordered what is called a corn burger which is corned beef on a hamburger. I was so hungry I asked if there were something I could get immediately and it was soup. I ordered the cheeseburger soup. I am writing this review before I even get my entrée, it literally could come out as garbage and it would not matter because this cheeseburger soup is so freakishly awesome. I could die From food poisoning and it would not matter because this cheeseburger soup is so crazy awesome. You have to try this place out."}
{"text":"Had the turkey and pastrami and it was fantastic.  Really great atmosphere, a hole in the wall. Cool painting on the ceiling. Hot coffee. Will be back."}
{"text":"When I was in college delivering newspapers I would stop in here almost every morning during the week. Great deli food and affordable breakfast specials. The place was family owned and ran (for the most part) and there was quite a following of regulars. 
Bacon and cheese omelet and the chicken salad melt were two of my favorites."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about them so I decided to try them out for lunch. First thing I noticed when I walked in was how tiny the place was. It's small and quaint, I like that. Im a very hungry person so I eat for three but I like to at least try to be somewhat healthy, sometimes, so i ordered their chicken noodle soup. I have to say, it surpassed my expectations. I love it when a soup is very seasoned, rich, and isn't skimpy with salt. I LOVED the soup! I also got a BLT which tasted amazing, only issue with it is that the stuff inside wasn't really laid out uniform so some bites got a lot of bacon and some had more lettuce than anything. Burger that I had though wasn't anything special unfortunately. I ordered the mushroom and Swiss. Taste was a bit bland and the bottom bun was soaked in mushroom juice. The party itself was a good size but the taste wasn't anything worth writing home about. It was very mediocre. That being said, I definitely plan to back though. 2 out of 3 things I ordered were very satisfactory and that works for me."}
{"text":"One of those oldschool joints with the $2.99 eggs, bacon, home fries and toast special. The corn beef sandwich (why I stopped here) is done right and piled high."}
{"text":"I've always  liked  this place.  But the new ownership has given this place a much needed upgrade! Great corned beef, soups etc... Today I went outside my usual order and got egg salad on toasted rye with a cup of ham & lentil soup and left happy, happy, happy!"}
{"text":"Very good food, service staff are friendly and takes good care of you. Will be making that a regular spot for me until I've eaten everything on the menu. Awesome place to eat at!!"}
{"text":"I have been here plenty of times through the years.  This is a good joint to go when you want something other than your typical Denny's or IHOP.  After breakfast, you'll find decent deli sandwiches and platters as well as really good desserts.  The food and service won't knock your socks off, but it's a step above the other options.  Unless you're at least 70, you'll feel like a youngster here as well.  So, if you need handicap parking, get here early."}
