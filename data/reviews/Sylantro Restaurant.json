{"text":"Hey u guys got check out this restaurant great pho  and authentic Vietnamese food .this a hidden Chem !!"}
{"text":"food came within 10 mins of ordering (im the only one who ordered at that time)   i ordered pork chop - it's good/ok ... pricier than most vietnamese reataurants especially for a lunch place (they dont have a lunch menu / cheaper option)  service -- eager to please but they are having a hard time understanding or explaining  bring head phones if you are eating alone -- they watch vietnamese tv show.  i would consider going back but they dont have cheaper options -- pork chop with shredded pork and salad on the side that i did not want to eat = with tax $10.27"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! One of the best pho places in town! The service is amazing and so is the food. The prices are reasonable as well! It tastes like authentic Vietnamese food and have big portions so it's definitely worth it! This will defintently be my go to Vietnamese restaurant!"}

{"text":"Uhhhh their food is edible.....  This place is nice and new inside. Very clean. Great service. But one small problem...their food was terrible! I am Vietnamese so if I go to a Vietnamese restaurant, you know that I'll have high expectations.   For starters, I got the chicken salad. The chicken was breast meat made very dry and tasteless. There was more carrots than cabbage which made every bite unsatisfying. This is not a hard dish to make, but it seemed more like they didn't care enough to do it right.  The sour soup was probably the only decent dish that they made. However....it was super salty so my family had to eat it with rice in order to make is less salty.  The catfish in the claypot was not done well at all. This dish was supposed have a thick sauce but the way they made is was almost like a fish soup because the sauce was so thin and tasteless. It also seemed like the fish wasn't marinated so the fish had absolutely no flavor. On top of that, the fish was overcooked so the texture of the fish made it hard to eat. In addition, we ask them to put some pork belly into the fish dish, but they put pork meat instead so it was really dry and hard.  This restaurant has potential, but if they want to make business, they definitely need to take another look at some cookbooks!  Oh and lastly, I'd recommend going to this restaurant during the day time because at night it's the only business opened in that shopping center and some not too nice people like to hang around there:/"}
{"text":"This restaurant has recently changed hands, and for the best. I originally tried Sylantro a few times over a year ago when it first opened and was underwhelmed. I decided to give the place another shot several days ago and what a difference! New owners, new decor, and most of all, new menu. I tried the pho, which was excellent, and stands up with the best in the city (and I've tried them all). I returned the following day and started off with the spring rolls, served with an amazing peanut sauce, that were so fresh they practically melted in my mouth. For the main course I had the pork chop plate, which turned out to be the best example of that dish that I've had yet. The meat was perfectly grilled, with a mound of rice topped with a fried egg and two very tasty pork cake wedges. Overall it was a delicious meal.   The establishment itself is very clean and attractive. The service was first rate and the people very friendly. I would very much recommend this restaurant and also urge those who tried it under its original ownership, and were disappointed, to give it another try."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing....they give you tons of food for a low price. Like I went to this restaurant and I ordered fish and it had 2 tiny pieces of fish in it but in this restaurant the pot was full of fish and it was only $10...I would definitely come back.....and to add on the service is great and friendly."}
{"text":"New Vietnam place on Sahara...super clean, friendly owners...food is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Such a cute spot! The bright magenta walls are a surprise, but they perfectly match the orchids on the counter. Space is clean and the service is friendly. Menu is larger than expected, with vermicelli, soups, rice plates, rolls, and hot pots.   Came at the end of a hot summer day with Cathey K and we stuck to lighter dishes- the seafood salad, the Sylantro salad, and the shrimp vermicelli bowl. Salads are huge and nicely presented with shrimp chips, which are fun for scooping up your salad to eat like nachos. Produce was super fresh and dressing was light. Cathey devoured her shrimp bowl in record time, and I'm looking forward to coming back for soup when the weather cools down.   The shopping center they're in is under construction, but I'm hoping they do well. I like how they offer the DIY rolls so you can assemble them yourself with the fresh herbs and protein, will have to try that on my next visit."}
{"text":"Food was excellent lots of flavor, good size portions, clean bathrooms, and friendly staff.  Had the family style meal (Com Phan) for 4 people.    Started off with Shakin' Diced Filet Mignon $12.95 (Bo Luc Lac) and it was very good.  The seasoned beef can be eaten by itself or dipped in a black pepper, salt, & lime juice mix with refreshing watercress underneath.   Hot n Sour Soup w Prawns $28 for lg pot (Lau Canh Chua Tom) also comes sm $15 or med $22.  There was a lot of flavor and full of fresh veggies.  One of the best hot n sour vietnamese style soup I've eaten here in Vegas.  The large was huge and we didn't even finish half of it.  Simmered Caramelized Catfish Claypot $10 (Ca Kho To) & Simmered Caramelized Pork Claypot $10 (Thit Kho To) both were so full of flavor I thought I was going to finish it by myself but the portions were bigger than other Vietnamese restaurants and I had to pack the rest to go!!    Also had the Caramelized Tofu and Eggplant in Claypot $9.50 because the wife likes veggies and I thought it was ok for not having any meat in there.  Vietnamese Iced coffee w condensed milk $3.75 - strong and sweet, definitely a must try if you've never had Vietnamese iced coffee before.  If they can keep the food tasting this good consistently and give the nice big portions with the great service they have now, this place will definitely be our new place to eat for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Is this place closed?  Came here on a Saturday night around 8PM and it was not open. Misleading hours."}
{"text":"Pho Sing Sing has moved to this location. The food and service is wonderful. It's the best pho I have had in Las Vegas the broth is complex and delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing I drove 20 min just to try it, I'm currently on my way back to for seconds."}
{"text":"The decor was very nice. There is a tv next to the bar and the restroom are very clean. Everything from the purple walls to the bamboo plant worked well together.   The owner is very sweet and the menu looked amazing. We ordered the hot and sour catfish soup, porkchop with rice and the combination claypot. The hot and sour soup had 4 huge pieces of catfish. The fish was amazing by itself but when you combined it with the soup it made it taste even better. The porkchop and combination claypot was flavorful and we enjoyed it a lot. But our favorite was the soup. I also ordered a ice coffee. The coffee drips into condense milk. You mix them together after it finished dripping. The coffee was strong. If you don't preferred it strong you can add water to diluted it.  Overall everything was great and we will go back. The owner said their pho is good, so maybe we will try that next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers the tastiest and most authentic Vietnamese food in Las Vegas. I grew up eating Vietnamese food everyday and this place reminds me of home. They offer a variety of noodle, rice, spring rolls, salads, hotpot dishes and more. Plus I am a sucker for mom and pops restaurants, and the owner is very nice.   Food: More than your usual Vietnamese spot. They have hot and sour catfish soup and clay pot dishes, which I have never seen at other Vietnamese restaurants. I've been here a few times and ordered to-go as well. I recommend the hot and sour soup with catfish (they also have shrimp if you don't like that fishy taste). It has a perfect combination of tangy, sweet and sour flavors. I also recommend the bun bo hue and bun rieu. Both were very delicious, true to their traditional ingredients/flavors, and just an interesting alternative to your usual pho noodle soups.   Service: It is still new so every time I've went there were only 1-2 other tables. It's a mom and pops type restaurant, so the same man takes care of us every time. He is friendly, efficient, on top with refilling water, and checked on our table several times. The decor has a true Vietnamese vibe with the magenta walls, bamboo decorations, and they play Vietnamese music/shows on the big screen TV by the cashier.   Overall: I've been choosing this place over the many Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown so that says something. My only complaint is that they are limited with desserts but that's okay because I need to lose weight anyway."}
{"text":"Excellent and flavorful pho. Friendly service and clean restaurant.  Will go back and try their other selections."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good I especially liked the pho because it's up to par with every good Vietnamese restaurants out there. Ambiance: I came in at lunch and it's not that busy. Clean tables and chairs Food: its good, its clean and its fresh. I tried the vegetables looks like it just picked a few minutes ago.  Service: here's why it's knocked down. It's not bad but they have to learn that if I'm the only one in the restaurant at least ask me if I want my water refilled and when the food is out, have chopsticks and spoon with it. The utensils are in the kitchen. A customer went by and asked for a takeout menu and they didn't. I don't blame language barriers but communication is key. The place has great potential but they just have stuff to work on.  I go with the pho because it's the basis of a good Vietnamese place for me."}
{"text":"Delicious new Vietnamese restaurant. I had a veggie clay pot with tofu. He had the vermicelli bowl deluxe. Both were flavorful and plentiful. We will definitely be back to try the pho and other items."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Not only is it right around the corner from my house, I really appreciate both the quality of the food AND the sweet service that my family and I receive every time we visit.  The tea is yummy, the Vietnamese Coffee is WONDERFUL (a new addiction !), the vegetarian egg rolls crispy and flavorful, & the Pho complex.  Today I had the Sylantro Salad... a healthy mix of pork, shrimp, and beef with a cabbage base and a sweet vinaigrette.  Totally satisfying... even brought some home for later! I've told all my foodie friends about it... and am looking forward to our next visit!"}
