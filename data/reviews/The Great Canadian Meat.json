{"text":"Visited a friend that worked in Whitby, and she suggested we go here for lunch.  Since I am not from this crappy city, just went with the flow.  At first, I was a little iffy.  I mean, first of all, there is no place to sit and eat--take out in a brown bag only.  But the huge line up was what got my attention.  I was starting to wonder why so many customers... and came to realization that it was the price.  Not sure how they can sustain themselves, really.  At a world where a sub costs $7 or $8, soup for another $2, and a drink for another $2--this place shames everyone by offering a sandwich, a soup, and a can of pop for measily $4.95.    That is right, $4.95 for all that.  Okay, so they are not the best sandwiches you have ever had.  In fact, it was quite forgettable.  There is nothing wrong with their food, just nothing that will make you say \"Hmmm this is a really good sandwich!\"  But you really can't argue, because they really do pack on the meat.  I had the smoked montreal meat, while my friend had the turkey.  I had mine on rye (did not taste like rye, but whatever), which was size of your typical sanwich bread.  They also offer regular white and multigrain, which are buns, size of a small sub from Mr. Sub (or tad larger than 6inch from Subway).  If you like your meat, you can pay a dollar, and they will nearly double the amount of your meat.  They had three choices of soups; we both had broccoli, which was similar to Tim Horton's cream of broccoli.  Crackers and pickle spears on the side.  And a can of Diet Coke :)  Hey, for 5 bucks.... I was pretty impressed.  Even though we had to sit on a curb to eat it."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years they make all there meats on site I even buy my lunch meats here"}
{"text":"Excellent bang for the buck for lunch, but come early.   The sandwich selection is great.   The small sandwich (which means about 5 lbs less meat) is more than sufficient for most people.  And the soups are awesome as well.   Soup, sandwich and a soft drink for around $6.   It beats the, uh, heck out of any of the fast food places."}
{"text":"This place is no gilts, no glamour, all quality product. It is the front end store deli for a meat manufacturer. Sandwiches are Awesome, fresh, and cheap. It is basically just for takeout as there really isn't anywhere to sit and it gets busy. My favorite deli by far!"}
{"text":"Nice casual lunch spot. Great food with great prices! Small/Large sandwiches are 3.99/4.99. Can grab more deli meats for take out!"}
{"text":"Great value for lunch for soup and a sandwich."}
{"text":"This is amongst the top ranked deli shops on my list in the GTA.  My go to is the Hot Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich.  Try the lunch special, small sandwich, soup, and drink for $7.00, and some change.  Like the other reviewer said, high quality meats for a cheap price.  Be forewarned many times, the lunch line goes out the door."}
{"text":"What a great cheap place for a good lunch! Had a small corned beef on a Multigrain bun with all the fixins for $3.99. How can you beat that? Will certainly be back."}
