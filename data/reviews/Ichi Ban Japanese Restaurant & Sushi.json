{"text":"The closest good sushi you'll find downtown. I've been going to Ichi Ban for a couple of years and have to say that its the best sushi you can find in downtown. They have a lot of specialty rolls such as the phoenix suns roll, spicy Tuna with unagi on the top with dressing. Pretty tasty. Their sashimi is fresh and made to order. The only bad thing about this restaurant is when your eating and it's not busy, they seem to be spying on you and makes it a lil uncomfortable for  you peeps that can't stand that the staff is looking at your every move. For me, I just want goo sushi and this place definitely hits the spot."}
{"text":"Wow! I tried this place for lunch today, I work across the street and it was so delicious I had to write a review! I stopped in and grabbed two sushi rolls to go; a California roll and a spicy tuna roll. The California roll was great but the spicy tuna was amazing I love the spicy sauce! The prices were great not overpriced at all, the service was really nice. It's not a fancy place but it looks clean. I will be returning here again! :)"}
{"text":"I love the teriyaki chicken bowl, so good. The people running this place are really friendly but at the same time are moving very quickly and do not sit around and chit-chat. They get you the food as fast as they can and they make sure it's how you want it then it's on to the next person. Couldn't ask for much more to be honest. Also I like this place because it's dark and relaxing inside, nice place to hide on a bright sunny day."}
{"text":"Ichi Ban means number one. Ichi = One; Ban = Number. This place is actually deceiving because it's not number one, its number last.   Language lesson aside, this place can be summed up in three words; Poor quality sushi.   I had take out yesterday and this place was just nearby my hotel. I got the sukiyaki and sushi combo and both the sukiyaki and sushi was sub par. The sukiyaki was wrapped twice, which was nice for take out but it actually tasted like crap. The sushi was also of a lesser quality so I was just disappointed in general. Maybe it's because I'm from NorCal but this kind of place should not be charging what it does for this combo. It was 20 bucks but for the quality, it should be 10-15 bucks. The other nice thing that I noticed while I was there was that they had sake bomb combos which is nice, because drinking is always awesome. You would probably need the drinks to mask the poor quality of the food. Probably explains why the place was largely empty."}
{"text":"Always satisfies. I have been there dozens of times and I will continue to go there. I have not once had a problem with the food and service."}
{"text":"My wife and I have tried several places. Thus place is the best. Seth will customize anything you like. It's awesome"}
{"text":"Just recently started eating sushi and while in Phoenix on a business trip stopped in and talked with Seth. He will make you anything you want so long as he can and for a new sushi person like myself this was big.  I will be coming here every time I'm in Phoenix"}
{"text":"The sushi here sucks!  Small portions and they are cheap with the rice bowl servings.  The owner is a real jerk and  can use some training on people skills.  The people who work here change as much as you do laundry!  I've seen the owner talk down to his employees like they're stupid.  So unprofessional. Don't order lunch special California roll.  You will feel silly paying that much money for a snack size sushi.  Based on the jerk owner I'd give this place a -1 but the chicken udon is actually good- so there is my 1 star."}
{"text":"Stay away from the sushi.  I guess this place is ok if you want to come in and grab a quick teriyaki bowl. But frankly, it's pretty disappointing and seems like it's the food they should serve inside a shopping mall."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with a friend. The place looks like a total hole in the wall dive but it is clean. The service was good, attentive and lots of iced tea (one of my pet peeves) so I can't complain. We both ordered sushi and it was quick and definitely tasty- but damn was it expensive (I totally should have read reviews before going). For the two of us, a tea, a water and a few basic rolls, it was $40. It always cheeses me when places don't offer a good lunch special.   Oh well, it tasted good and didn't kill us :)"}
{"text":"Food sucks. Never consistent in flavor. Service sucks. Fast food Korean Japanese food - I don't know why they call a restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch last week and the sushi was par at best.   I can't recommend this place and wouldn't go back.  Sorry. Was excited to try it but it was a complete let down.  For all of those \"five star\" reviews I suggest that you search out a truly fantastic sushi place. Thus, if you were \"blown away\" by Ichi Ban then you're going to completely explode when you taste what sushi should taste like.  Best of luck."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi done right and very well. Seth is a great chef and very friendly. Reasonably priced and I'm from N.Y.C. so when I say good I mean great!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced sake, mediocre rolls, and the Yellowtail nigiri was obviously past it's prime. I'm lucky it didn't make me ill. Won't be back when Hana Sushi is just around the corner at 7th Ave and Missouri."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying: the sushi was GREAT.  The service was horrible. I think they were understaffed which I understand but the woman who appeared to be the manager or owner acted like we were a bother when coming in, attempting to order, asking for extra wasabi, EVERYTHING. It was rather disheartening. The girl working had all of the tables and the manager/owner kept going to the back and returning with nothing as if she was hiding.  The experience was very off. But the table chef helping people was kind and even said hi to us as he finished cooking for other guests.   I wouldn't return for sit down service but maybe take out. But alas, two weeks after going here they are closed down."}
{"text":"Based on yelp reviews, I expected better.  I ordered the tempura dinner and was very disappointed. The tempura batter used to fry the shrimp was thick and terrible, did not taste at all like tempura.  Received a salad that had old iceberg (brown edges) and no dressing.  Had to ask for dressing, the cook apologized saying he forgot.  I think the best part of the dinner was the rice!  I would not return and I think they need to learn how to make better tempura."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken was ok, sauce too sweet and too much of it. I liked they offered the brown rice as an option. I was leaning towards the sushi, but the fish looked funny, fishy if you like (Sorry for the bad pun, but I had to!)"}
{"text":"I ordered take out because my work is right across from this place. I went to get the sushi 10 minutes later when I figured the order was done. I was confronted by a street bum who cursed at me for not giving him money. When I went inside, I mentioned this incident to someone working there and they confronted the man and made him leave but he didn't I left and this same guy followed me back to my work throwing insults my way. When I went to eat my sushi it seemed very warm even thought I order nothing that should be cooked. Wasn't impress with the temperature. The sushi seems very small."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best sushi in town. And I have tried almost everywhere there is too try. He orders his fish frequently and it is always fresh. Seth and I have grown to have a strong friendship just from my visits to this establishment. I always try and bring new faces in and have never seen one leave with a look of disappointment. Ask Seth for a \"freestyle\" roll and whether you like it hot, crunchy, fried, or sweet, let him put his magic to work. Some of the best rolls I've had from him haven't come from the menu although I will recommend the Phoenix Suns Roll to anyone who likes Ee"}
{"text":"I ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl with rice and vegetables today for take out. It was good and the portion size was adequate for lunch. The price was reasonable and the server was friendly. The ambiance was acceptable."}
{"text":"Great place! Great Food. People who always say they can't find good sushi downtown need to find this place! They will make things off menu if you are so inclined. Happy hour is great prices as well."}
{"text":"Good for take out. Quick and easy. Will work with you on the menus.  Very efficient   Honest hard working restrant."}
{"text":"I would say that the sushi is mediocre at best. The rolls have a texture to them that I don't enjoy. On top of that, the prices are far too high. You might as well buy some pre-made sushi from the grocery store."}
{"text":"I had been to Ichi Ban about 2 years ago and I was not at all impressed with the quality of the sushi. The rice wasn't too good, was not good on sushi but I'm sure it could have been good with some teriyaki on it! The rolls are way too over priced. 9 dollars for a philly? Really? Maybe if the rice was good and the fish tasted fresh but, nope. The most I'd pay for a philly here is 6.50. They also seemed to skimp on the size of the rolls.  It's a shame because they could have SO much more business if they dropped the prices a bit and worked harder at making better rice since there are barely any sushi places downtown."}
{"text":"Good beef teriyaki rice/veg bowl - hard to find in Phoenix for some reason.  The beef IS kinda tough though and maybe a little scorched.  I don't do sushi - so I can't speak on that.    Parking is tight around weekday lunchtimes.    Very dark inside, poor lighting, but I just get Take Out anyway.  Seems clean.  One of the main dudes near the cashier seems to have a worthwhile sense of dry humor which is nice.  Fast service.    Portions vary from visit to visit though...  I guess I could ask for extra beef in my beef teriyaki bowl.  If you opt out of the veggies on top of the rice, you still pay the same amount.  I'd prefer to get a little more of the beef instead, but they didn't offer that.  Still a good choice where good teriyaki beef is hard to find in this town.  That's one reason to miss Seattle where there is good teriyaki beef on every corner, but perhaps one of the few reasons to miss Seattle..."}
{"text":"If you're in search for fresh delicious sushi in Phoenix, you should definitely try this spot.  I'm not into rolls so much, so if you want trendy overpriced gringo sushi then you might want to head over to Pure Sushi in Scottsdale.  I've eaten here several times, and I've never been disappointed.  The price point is fair and the sashimi and nigiri are fresh and always satisfying!    We always sit at the bar, and you can hear the sounds of people \"mmmm'ing\" all around, and gratuitously thanking the chef for their meal.    The ambiance won't win any awards, but it's clean and the the staff is undyingly polite and attentive.   Last time I was in the chef urged us to try the white tuna that he had just had Fed ex'd from Hawaii... OMFG, it was such a fantastic flavor experience.  With that I urge you the brave at heart to try whatever is on the specials menu."}
{"text":"Service was great....  Kind of a hole in the wall, but food was great and they put up with my drunk ass! :) YAY!"}
{"text":"It seemed like a slow night, about 5 at the bar, and one other couple sitting at tables.  The Suns game was playing quietly in the background. The place looks and smells clean, always a good sign. Service was good and attentive.  We didn't have to wait too long for the food. Now, I'm no sushi snob, but I know what excellent and mediocre sushi tastes like.  Honestly, the sushi here wasn't horrible. But, for the price we paid, we should have gotten higher quality sushi.  I'm a pretty basic guy, I want the veggies crunchy, the rice soft, the fish fresh.  Like I said, it wasn't horrible.  However, I felt like I was paying high prices for slightly better than grocery store sushi.   Next time, I'll stick to the teriyaki and ramen."}
{"text":"Yum! I hadn't been here in years, glad I came back. Nice little hole in the wall sushi spot. Sushi was fresh and delicious. We actually really loved the spicy cali roll, simple I know but the sushi chef uses home made spicy mayo and it was sooo good! We just grabbed a quick lunch of a couple rolls and our bill was just under 30 bucks. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Overall mediocre. Decent sushi, average prices. Went one time..idk if I'd go back"}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch because it's located right across my work. Oh my lord, it was a disaster. I ordered Beef Udon but I couldn't eat the meat because it was cooked and left outside for too long. The guy in the front scoops the meat as I order then takes it to the kitchen to put it in my noodles..??!!  1 star for the food 1 star for saying \"Thank you. Have a good day\" when I leave. Seriously, if the owner is reading, please improve your dishes and customer service. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! They had great sushi and amazing service. Although we didn't know it we came in close to closing time but never felt rushed. It wasn't until we started talking with the owner that we found out the closed 30 min ago! However, he took extra time just to talk with us about his sushi, business and Phoenix. Can't wait to go back and chat with Seth!"}
{"text":"Yes. YES. YES!  I Ban is the cat's meow when it comes to sushi dining in Phoenix. I typically sway away from the sushi bar seating but the chef here (err - I don't recall his name now!) is excellent. He's fun, funny, spoke with us about what we liked and made great suggestions. It was the best sushi dining experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm trying to be generous with my review. I order sushi and the taste wasn't fresh. I felt like it was a fast food joint an I barely finished my meal. I like this sushi place because it was fresh and the service was really good. It really need more improvement comparing to my last experience. I hope they can comeback to the quality that was before.  Good luck."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood, locally-owned sushi place and NOT a chain (as someone suggested in another review). I had to weigh in because we have been going to Ichi Ban for 7 years and the owner, Seth, and his staff have been consistent, attentive and friendly. And the sushi is fresh, creative and tasty in my opinion. Order something off the \"specials\" menu posted on the wall and you can't go wrong with the spicy tuna. It also isn't as expensive as other sushi restaurants and there are other menu options for land lovers. Great sushi place for lunch or dinner and right on the light rail."}
{"text":"Seth is an amazing sushi chef! Amazing food. Fresh and worth the money. Must place to eat!"}
{"text":"So as we speak, I am eating my teriyaki chicken bowl for lunch. I've worked so close for over a year now and never thought to come here until my co-workers walked over. I was so excited to get a rice bowl with extra vegetables.  So...I'm asian - therefore, I have high standards.  Like chipotle, they ask you what you want - and it's like an assembly line where the food is pre-made.  Pros: Priced reasonable and close to work.   Cons: The vegetables were way oversteamed and didn't taste fresh and the teriyaki sauce wasn't that good.  I hear the sushi is pretty good here, but based on my meal, I think I will skip it."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch often. They have good lunch prices on sushi and rice/noodle bowls. The staff is always friendly. You can eat in or carry out. I usually get the lunch spicy tuna roll. It is delicious and cheap! Their miso soup is pretty good. I've never tried the bowls because I know I would go into a food coma after lunch, but they always look delicious. Some of their regular sushi rolls are a little pricey, but other than that, no complaints. A great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I got there about 4:30 on a week day which happens to be about an half an hour before they open.  decided to just stick around and wait for them to open.  The owner drives up and tells me it's too cold to be waiting outside and that I should come on in even though they aren't open yet.  Good start.    You walk in and it feels like a real sushi bar.  No leather lined walls.  No fire and ice fireplace.  No hostess in a geisha outfit.  Just lots of wood and cheap chairs.  You know, like a sushi bar should be.  The place looks and smells clean.  Ok, so far we are doing well.  So i grab some hot sake on a cold rainy day and starting to instantly feel at home.  I tell the sushi chef to just bring whatever he recommends.  some low points and some high points.  Then he brings me the white tuna.  Oh my god!!!!  This is the best thing ever.  Soft, buttery, tons of flavor.  At this point I couldn't be happier.  Everything I ordered at this point was tasty and fresh.  The only downside was the rice....Not bad but not great.  The octopus however, was really good.  If it is not cut right it can be very rubbery.  This however, was not.    I will definitely be back.  The service was absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"This is a good place to stop for lunch, or if you are in the area and have an hour for dinner... which was my situation.  I met my friend who had suggested this place.  The interior is a lot nicer than I expected, but I would not let that fool you.  Overall, it is still a very average place. The one thing it has going for it is convenience.  It is incredibly convenient. My friend worked nearby, and we were on our way to a class even more nearby.  She liked the tempura, so that is what we had.  The tempura was very good, but I thought the place was a bit pricey for what it was."}
{"text":"Let Me start by saying I am a sushi virgin, and many will say I still am. This is the only place I have ever had sushi. I did have a seared Ahi tuna at Scoma's in San Fran does that count? Moving on... Does it count if it's cooked?? I am told no. Anyway I loved 95% of what I ate here. Now we had a Philly roll, Spider roll, Tiger Eye roll, Texan (SPICY), and then eel and octopus. Everyone but me liked the eel and octopus. I couldn't get past the texture. But the other stuff was great with a little Wasabi yummy!  This is a little dive in a strip mall but it is clean and the staff is very friendly, funny and helpful.   Guess it's good enough for a Sushi virgin. Hard core sushi lovers may want to smack me."}
{"text":"2 visits in the last month. Both visits weren't good. I'm just not a fan period.   Lengthy wait time Unorganized Wait staff isn't helpful  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Ok so we're sitting here as I type this review.  The ordering process stinks, the staff seems totally clueless. When I requested shashimi they didn't know what it was and the prices when they did find it was ridiculous.  The itamae has practically no skill, the cuts are inconsistent, poor presentation, overly wet, just bad.  My companions rolls took forever and the bowls served to the others were simply bland and tasteless.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Holy gross!!! Wow! I haven't been to a place this awful in a while. The customer service is awful just to start.  The method of order processing is a joke.  Secondly,  I ordered sushi that was so gross and inedible that when I pointed it out to the waitress she laughed and still brought me a $30 lunch bill. (it was so bad I had to excuse myself to spit it up in fear of swallowing it)  I paid but will NEVER go back and NEVER recommend. Ewwww wet/soggy and just GROSS!!!"}
{"text":"The rice bowls are a yummy quick lunch!  I have never eaten the sushi here because I am super, mega picky about sushi. Raw fish is serious people!  I go in here on my half hour lunch break to grab a steamy hot bowl of chicken curry about once a month. Its not Japanese curry like I was used to eating for the majority of my preggers days, but it will do. Of course I no longer live in Japan either... The chicken is tender the curry is savory, and the rice is well cooked and not dry. You can get hot sauce on the side to spice to your liking. It has a lot of potatos in it, that might be the only thing I don't like about this curry.   I miss Japan... I would even settle for Curry House Coco Ichibanya if there was one here. Okay my mouth is watering which means its time to go!  Oh my Naughty Nielly always orders the chicken teryaki bowl and that is pretty good too.   Xx, Reese"}
{"text":"(UPDATE 1/09 ~ Things from the following review have been fixed at this location and it is once again on my rotation and has become a happy place. 4 stars!)  My happy place just pissed me off. I spoke to the owner though, so I hope something changes. Apparently they have some new staff people who have no clue how to treat customers. They were rude to me, annoying, grabby and basically ruined my lunch hour, to the point where I left the joint.   Secondly, the sushi rice was not as good as I am accustomed to from them and I don't know why they would mess with it. They haven't given me fruit at the end of my meal in a long time and with the annoyance I have had twice now with the service they just dropped down on my rotation.  It's only because of closeness that they will get another shot, but after 8 years of loving this place I am very sad to see it in this condition. The sushi still tastes good, but as I said they did something weird with the rice recently."}
{"text":"Been coming to Ichi Ban about once a month for over 3 years now.  I almost forgot to give them a good review they deserve.    I have only eaten here during lunch time and I always get the same thing, the terriaki chicken rice bowl, sometimes with white rice sometimes with brow rice.  I've tried their sushi and egg rolls before too.  I'm always satisfied with their friendly quick service and hot fresh food.  I just might start going for dinner here soon.  It's very small inside, kinda a whole in the wall place.  I do like the interior and it seems very romantic.  First date place would be good here.  Prices are decent and they have a huge variety of sushi rolls.  Can't wait to try them all."}
{"text":"No, thank you.   Maybe I just went on a bad day. I had sushi and got sick. Literally had to run to the bathroom in the middle of dinner. Gross."}
{"text":"I normally won't eat at the ichi Ban chain. The sushi is normally sub-par. But at this location, there is a line a lunch and dinner. The cheif is talented and the staff are friendly and fast. For an ichi Ban, 3 stars is a very high rating."}
{"text":"My new favorite local spot!!! Got the udon noodles with veggies no meat. The owner even said he could add tofu special for me next time!! He was awesome and talked to us while we waited for Our to go food. Waiting on the next time we can get take out :-)"}
{"text":"Not a bad experience, but not great either. Interior is kind of dated and worn. Staff were arguing with a customer (loudly) while we dined...something about boxing up a to go order? Food was just mediocre. I have had much better and once or twice, worse. Just happened to be in the area and decided to try it out for lunch. Meh. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The selection of sushi rolls on the menu is second to none in the valley.  I know that I am always getting the best quality sushi and service when I visit.  The staff are always hustling and working hard to make your experience quick, especially during lunch.  This place is always packed during lunch but the wait is no longer than an average lunch time wait anywhere else.  The food is so much better than any other place downtown!  Highly recommend the sushi here!"}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki bowl and a California Roll and it was pretty good; I think the teriyaki bowl was better of the two.  The entire meal with no drink cost like $6-$7 bucks so it's not too bad for a cheap lunch.   I'm sure I'll be back soon..."}
{"text":"Great sushi/sashimi, but spendy.  I went for lunch.  Got a couple of rolls that were fantastic.  One california roll.  One order of sashimi.  A teriyaki bowl to go for a friend.  I think the total came to like $60.  Delicious, but expensive.  Oddly, I don't mind paying about the same amount at Zen32 for dinner, so maybe it's just that the lunch atmosphere didn't match the price.  I had no complaints about the food at all--it was actually very good.  If you're not price-sensitive, this place gets four stars from me."}
{"text":"Not sure why Ichi Ban is getting a bad bunch of reviews. I went here many many times when I lived in the neighborhood, and while it doesn't stack up to Hana, Yasu, or the like, it's a nice solid neighborhood place.  The owner, Seth, is a genuinely nice person, and prides himself in being creative with the sushi roll list and taking care of his customers. They offer about 20 rolls that are all something different than the norm. They make use  of a lot of spicy things, and fish combinations that aren't usually seen. I give them props for being different.   The service here is great as well. Though I always get a very odd vibe from the servers and the restaurant. I've been here a few times when I am the only one and the 4-5 employees on the clock are all staring at you, waiting for you to need something. Interesting, but leave me alone for a few minutes. You creep me out when you watch me eat.   They don't have any music, and the place lacks a lot of atmosphere, but the food is pretty tasty. At lunch time it is an order at the counter, rice bowl kind of place. Dinner time, you have a full menu to order from and everything is good. They do not have a full liquor license, only beer and sake."}
{"text":"The food may not be the greatest, but it is still damn good, especially considering the price during the lunch buffet.  However, the fact that I've been overcharged on both of my previous two visits by over $2.50 each time is just ridiculous. Just absolutely ridiculous.   Avoid this place unless you are paying cash."}
{"text":"Met some friends here last night with high expectations due to good reviews. We had a party of 10 so we made sure we were there right when they opened at 5pm. They sat us immediately but when  we asked them up front (before we ordered) to split the checks they had a bit of an attitude. We made it a game to get them to lighten up. Which they did! A for effort on the waitresses part. We had her laughing and smiling.  I should mention here that when we walked in it smelled fishy as well. Not a good sign for a sushi place. This should have been our second red flag. Food came fairly quickly. It was ok nothing special and a bit overpriced for what you get. Towards the end they started to rush to get us out which we would have gladly done 30 minutes prior if they would bring our checks. By the time we got home I was extremely sick and that was how the rest of my night went! I am not new to sushi. In fact its my fav! I would NEVER go back to this place. The only reason its getting 1 star is because the waitress was a hoot!"}
{"text":"\"Do you like Mother Nature?\" This question came after the check. It was on the heel of a discussion about mountain biking and camping. South Mountain. Camelback. San Francisco Peak. He liked it all. In fact, he liked to talk. He being the owner, I mean.   My friend and I arrived around 5:30 for dinner. We were greeted right away and shown a table. Our Kirin Lights shortly followed. The sushi menu offered nigiri, sashimi and their roll selection, which included one called \"Phoenix Suns.\" The owner soon embarked on striking up a conversation with us. His English was somewhat broken, though. I let my friend do the talking. I added, \"We'll trust you\" when it was decided that we'd let him pick a roll for us and put together a sashimi platter.   While we waited, we sampled the miso soup and drank our beer. Soon, a brightly colored roll came to our table. \"Spicy Slim\" is what we were told it was. We had no idea what it was, until the owner came over later to chat some more. Crab on the inside, tuna on the outside - covered in spicy sauce. Well then. It was pretty tasty, especially with the coating (like small, white crunchy flakes). It got pretty spicy the more you ate.   Soon the sashimi came. We had peppered and seared salmon (yum), extra white tuna, ahi tuna, yellow tail and salmon. Each piece was very good. The sizes were generous, too. The sahsmi came with two small dipping bowls, too. Sort of a mild spicy sauce, an alternative to soy. The sauce was a great complement to the meal.   My friend wanted more. Man, she can pack it away! So, we ordered some mackeral nigiri and a caterpillar roll. The mackerel was very good, although I thought the rice it laid on was a bit too sticky - hard to chew. The caterpillar roll was good, though. It was your basic eel meets avocado. The eel sauce was sweet without being overly sweet and overpowering the taste of the roll.   Overall, a great meal! The service was also great - although a bit too attentive. Considering we were the only patrons (minus a couple sitting at the sushi bar), they were just waiting around to serve us. In fact, they tried to take our miso soups away twice before we were actually finished.   Also, there was the chattering - the owner striking up a conversation after we paid, when we are about to get up from our seats. First it was about basketball, since on the big screen I saw that it was about to be Bedlam (Oklahoma State vs. OU). Funny, considering I went to OSU and my friend is a big Sooners fan. I think the owner wanted to see us throw down. Who knows. In any case, basketball talk soon turned to travel (Hawaii was a hot topic) and the outdoors. We gradually weened the conversation to a flutter and left.   As we were pulling away, my friend said, \"Oh god, he's outside waving to us.\" It was true. He was outside, alright, bidding us adieu. Some may call that spectacular service. I think that was over doing it a bit much. Yet, what else had he to do? It seems the FBR had devoured most of his dinner patrons. Besides, he did admit that Ichi Ban is more of a hot lunch spot for the surrounding businesses.   As for the bill, it came to about $100. True, we did order some more expensive fish (like the white tuna), but it was not worth $50 a person. No way, no how. Especially since you felt like you stumbled upon an obscure shopping plaza and into a sushi diner, not a restaurant. (Case in point: They have a seperate counter to take orders for teriyaki rice bowls and the like.) The decor didn't so much bother me, though. It was the extra attention. I guess I just don't like being spoiled (that's one way to look at it).   Plus, the owner is Korean. We know this because they were speaking to each other in another language, and my friend picked up on it. He was Korean alright. She should know. She married one."}
{"text":"Is this, like, the only place in midtown to get sushi? The portions seemed a bit on the lean side for the price, but are otherwise good. Nothing I'd had has been orgasmic, but nothing I've had has made me volcanically erupt. So, a good little sushi shop, for what it's worth.  The service tends to be hit or miss and we've not had to wait for a seat."}
