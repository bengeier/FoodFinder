{"text":"This review relates only to the Annual Oyster Feast.  We attended the 3rd annual one on October 2nd, 2014.

Price per head was $95.  Wine and beer was advertised as included but there were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill.  The wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor.  So that whole aspect was a sales pitch.  For $95, I'm done buying.

The oyster selection was incredible (at least in terms of presentation)  Ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country.  By the time you returned to your seat, you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same.  Not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor.

Other selections were fried oysters (over breaded and void of any oyster flavor), oysters Rockefeller (fine enough), and a clam crostini (too fishy)

After about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers, you realize that's it.  There is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it (and why wouldn't there be, it's $95 so I 'm going into it thinking it is a meal) .  But they don't even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal.

Overall, with the alcohol included, it is probably at most a $55 a head event considering you will still have to go out for dinner afterwards."}
{"text":"food was comparable to ruby Tuesday's.  Don't let the fancy wording on the menu fool you."}
{"text":"Had both good and disappointing experiences  On the plus side the service was great, attentive, helpful and friendly.  

Unfortunately, the food left a lot to be desired.  It was overwhelmingly salty!!!  I've had french food in multiple cities and restaurants and its usually on par with highlighting flavors.  But on the day i went, all anyone could taste was the salt, whether it was meat, vegetables or soup.  Actually the steak was cooked correctly and was tender, but the excess of salt ruined it.  Same with the duck. The scallops were so overcooked they were basically rubbery, which another person at my table found difficult to even eat.  

Since there were a lot of good reviews about the food here, I would hope that my party was there on an off night and this is not the regular standard of food, because all the things we ordered was standard french fare."}
{"text":"Wow! What a wonderful experience. First time visiting and I have to say everything we ordered was delicious.  The best oysters I've ever had were on my honeymoon in British Columbia and they had West Coast oysters here that were very similar and brought back great memories for me and my husband! 

Food and service would have warranted a 5 star review alone, but to top it all off, we received our bill and it was $0! One of the owners decided to comp our meal because we were celebrating my birthday and my husband was celebrating veteran's day. That is above and beyond great customer service! 

Thank you for an amazing evening :)"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and it has been delicious both times.  It's great French food and its okay to bring kids here.

Update: we have been back twice and it has been slipping dramatically. The food have been below average."}
{"text":"My wife and I were so excited to dine here - we had been waiting for a special occasion and when her godfather came to visit we thought this would be a real treat.  I had grouper it was the special of the day and I was really surprised that I could smell it as was being served, the sauce had a consistency of saliva and was virtually tasteless - My wife had chicken which was the decent and her Godfather was served 3 scallops which were undercooked  He ate about one by trimming off the ends.  The waitress didn't even seem to notice the visual consistency when she cleared the plate and think how could someone not finish three scallops.  Ironically it seemed like there were executives from the restaurant that the manager was walking around with- you would think there would have been extra scrutiny to the service

This is about the worse value I've ever experienced You might as well throw $100 at the window and then go to viva chicken. It would cost the same and at least you wouldn't have put foul food in your mouth.

We were also utterly embarrassed that we brought our out of town guest here"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a HORRIBLE first experience here and will not be back. When we arrived, we sat towards the front of the bar area because they said that a group reservation will be taking place in the back of the bar area. The waitor took our appetizer order that took several minutes to come out for such a small plate. Then we never saw him again. We had to stop another waiter to ask for dinner menus...never came back. And then a lady came by and asked us if we were doing ok and we said absolutely not! We asked for our check and left to get dinner at another restaurant. My wife was so upset that she called them back the next day to speak to management and tell them of our horrible experience. Service was so bad that they asked if there was something they could offer us to make us want to come back but it was so bad that we declined. FYI, my wife was a waitress for years and has worked in the retail industry for ages now and knows the importance of good  customer service. This was absolutely not it!!!"}
{"text":"We came in during brunch hours and sat at the bar.  Apparently the guy behind the bar (we think a manager, because not in the normal uniform) was not happy as it was a bit after 2:00 PM and brunch stops at 2:30.  He took drink order and did not offer a lot of info as to the food options.  When we had to inquire he told us the only option was the brunch and sped away not to be seen again.  After about 15 minutes, and empty drinks we finally stopped a waiter who did apologize and comped our drinks.  

First time such poor service here.  We will be back (every place can have a fail) but disappointed."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday Buffet Brunch yesterday. This restaurant needs lots more staff!!
Our server was pleasant but very harried--I could see all the tables she had- too many for 1 person------- they also need more\"floaters\" to fill coffee and water glasses and clear plates-
 I had to ask the hostess twice to have someone clear our plates because we had no room on our 2-top. Food was fine- nothing outstanding-- desserts- meh.....   
 Very noisy! a Birthday party of 12 next to us was celebrating and very loud.
  Whole experience was  quite disappointing for a restaurant of this caliber.......I have been here number of times in the past but not sure if I want to come back."}
{"text":"Their brunch is amazing! If you're not a fan of a buffet style meal - fine. Order off their menu. The staff and service are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night on tour of Charlotte restaurants I wanted to try.  This was my first stop.  We sat at the bar.  My husband had on shorts and a button down short sleeve shirt, me jean pedal pushers, a cotton blouse.  We both had on nicer flip flops.  I felt fine as far as my dress was concerned.  Husband felt like we should have been dressier, but I saw other people in there dressed like we were, so I still think you can be nice casual here and fit in fine.

Excellent cocktails.  My husband had the John Daly which tasted like sweet tea.  He downed several within the span of minutes.  I had the cucumber ginger collins.  Quite good!  Has fresh cracked pepper but don't let that turn you off.  It is a really good drink!  Very refreshing.  They also have different beers.  Mostly in bottles but will serve in frosted glass.

My husband and I had a wonderful crock of  the mussels in white wine with side of pomme frites.  There are several variations.  The bartender was fantastic.  She recommended the curry ones, but I'm not a huge fan of curry.    We loved the mussels and right when we were finishing up the mussels, we were presented with slices of fresh french bread to sop up the juices.  Right on queue it seems.  The pomme frites were excellent, too!  Would be nice if they had an herb mayonaisse to serve with them rather than just ketchup.  That would be a great addition.

If you are looking for a real raw bar in town, you cannot go wrong in this place.  They have pretty much any shellfish you want.  I will definitely be returning to try the oysters, crab, shrimp and clams.  The presentation was excellent.  I will also try dinner.  Loved the atmosphere.   I think the restaurant will do well.  They are filling an empty niche."}
{"text":"Finally, Charlotte gets a decent French meal with terrific service. Second time in two weeks we've been there, the first was a nice romantic meal for two, the second was for three of us. Both times the food was top notch. Service the first time was impeccable, the second left something to be desired, but still better than most. In all  this is a great place destined to become a Charlotte institution."}
{"text":"i've been waiting for a good french restaurant in charlotte for a long time.  whenever café monte first opened, i was one of the first in line to partake of its cuisine.  with the exception of its quiche, i had a hard time remembering something truly worthy of a second visit.  now, i know that sounds harsh, but i believe that successfully navigating through a sea of beurre is a tale of black and white - you either rocked it, or you tanked.

for the most part, i think georges brasserie rocked it.

for starters, i haven't had a bad server in the five times i've eaten there.  on each occasion, the attention to detail was impeccable, and we found ourselves remarking on how the manager must wield a figurative bullwhip to beat the staff into such shape.  water glasses are not empty for long, and the servers are well-versed in all the dishes, instead of staring blankly while suggesting the most expensive entrée of the bunch.

i love the beef bourguignon . . . tender cuts of beef slow cooked alongside bacon and vegetables until fork tender.  served atop egg noodles, it's difficult to find fault with its execution.  alas, i wasn't as impressed with the trout amandine, more because the fish was overcooked than due to the flavor of the delicious brown-butter almond sauce.  ahhh, french sauces.  sorry - i was momentarily distracted.

i thought the side of sautéed spinach was well-seasoned and fresh.  the macaroni (?) was replete with bacon (and a side of heart attack), but it was cheesy and satisfying, if somewhat out of place.

my hubby's braised lamb shank was AMAZING.  the pickled red onion served alongside the dish was a revelation, and i began browsing through recipes as soon as i returned home so that i could concoct my own version.

for vegetarians, i really thought the ratatouille was excellent, but it is not always on the menu, so i would check prior to going.

the atmosphere of georges brasserie is a great combination of trendy yet comfortable.  there are subtle touches of a whimsy, americanized notion of france, but it's not overpowering or cheesy.  i actually really liked it - the vibe of a charming french bistro with a lot more space.

all-in-all, i think this a terrific place for a nice meal out or a great way to show off charlotte to out-of-towners.

yeah.  thank god i'm not stuck with café monte."}
{"text":"We tried Georges for Charlotte Restaurant Week since we hadn't had a chance to get there and thought this to be an opportune time to try and share multiple courses. 

Upon arrival, we were told that they were running a bit behind and they recommended that we sit at the bar while we waited. Our reservation was for 7:30pm and, after enjoying a glass of wine, we checked back with the hostess at 8pm to get a status. She let us know that it would only be a bit longer and that they knew where we were sitting at the bar and would come fetch our party when our table was ready. After another 30 minutes passed, we checked in with the hostess again at 830pm only to be told that they gave our table to another party in error and would work to get a table cleared for us asap. 

Once seated, the manager came over and offered us a bottle of champagne to make up for the mix-up. We understood that it was a busy night and that sometimes Restaurant Week can result in diminished service/food quality due to higher volumes of guests than usual. That being said, it was a nice touch to have the management attempt to rectify our wait time.

Our waiter came by the table to take our order soon after we were seated--we each ordered off of the Queen's Feast menu and also ordered a bottle of wine for the table. Within 10 minutes of ordering, runners were at our table with their arms full of plated entrees. After telling them that we hadn't yet received our first course, so they must be for another table, they walked back to the kitchen--only to return a second time 60 seconds later. With the plates in their hands, they informed us that there was a mix-up and they had fired our entrees prior to starters and asked what we wanted them to do, rather than just taking the plates back and either trashing them or bringing them to another table (during restaurant week, we assumed there were multiple others waiting on the same dishes). 

When we asked if they could bring our starters and start over, they informed us that they would be putting our entrees under a heat lamp in the back--something even less desirable than just eating them early, so we ended up taking them without the first course having been served. They then asked if we even wanted our starters, which we did since we were paying for them regardless. 

A manager was sent out after the starters were delivered (now each of us had 2 courses at once and no chance of preserving the heat in both at the same time) who offered us no apologies, just the statement that they were \"doing the best they could\" and offering to cover the cost of our bottle of wine. This was certainly a pleasant gesture but, being raised in the restaurant industry, not a replacement for a proper apology. 

The server avoided us for the most part after these mix-ups and, when he returned to clear plates, he cleared some dishes that we were still in the process of finishing without asking or staying for long enough for us to ask for them to be left. 

Restaurant weeks are typically a time for diners to try places for the first time and, hopefully, enjoy the experience enough to return. We eat out at restaurants at and above the level of Georges on a regular basis including casual weeknight dinners out, we were there to test out the restaurant, not to get a deal or look for handouts. That being said, the service was appalling and the manner in which the night was handled (avoidance, no apologies, and general lack of professionalism) was inexcusable. We will not be returning to Georges any time soon and hope that they use this as a moment to coach their staff on customer service and respect especially since the food was decent, but tainted by the generally unacceptable experience."}
{"text":"Here comes another Restaurant Week review! I love when a restaurant uses this week to pull me in and entices me to come back the rest of the year...and George's did just that. First off, I loved the ambiance, the bar area with oysters and shellfish (which we admired from afar) and the curved dining room. I started with a Spicy Mule - which I can't decide if I liked or not. The spice was definitely there, but I think it was lacking some of the ginger beer flavor I would have liked more of. Off the RW menu we ordered the lobster bisque and the white wine mussels - the mussels won that round. Next up was the coq au vin and the beef bourginion - the coq au vin with the gruyere polenta won this match-up (if you're keeping score, so far my meal is beating my husband's.) Finally, for dessert, we'd selected the creme brulee and the chocolate cake (by a fancier name, even our server said, \"oh the chocolate cake\" as I struggled to pronounce it from the menu.) Finally my husband gets on the board with the creme brulee.

We'll be back, sooner rather than later, for their awesome Happy Hour deals in the bar.

Oh, a final note, after spiraling up, up, up the parking garage to finally find a spot, we discovered that George's valet is complimentary (or at least it was that night), so do some research and maybe save yourself the hassle of trying to park at Piedmont Town Center on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Georges is a must. I've been there on numerous occasions and it has exceeded my expectations each time. The Lobster Gnocchi is my absolute favorite thing on the menu. The soft, billowy gnocchi, the creamy celery root purée, the fresh lobster! The scallops entree is also wonderful. Also, ask for their dinner specials. I've had monkfish and grilled trout and they were just as delicious, fresh and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"We went for bunch last week for the first time and had a terrible experience. The hostess, a woman that I unfortunately didn't catch her name, was very rude and impatient. I felt as if she did not want our business. Her irritation for our party was very apparent. 

We had a party of 10 for brunch. I can admit however we were late for our reservation. Then to add more confusion, some of our party cancelled last minute. 

Brunch ended at 2:30 (which some of us weren't aware of which again is our fault) and we had a 1:30 reservation. They would not sit our party until the entire party was there. I understand this is standard at most places. But it was not a plated brunch, it was a buffet. 7 people were present and our table was open right in our view. In addition, it was so close to brunch ending, I felt it could have been waved since majority of our party was present. They finally allowed us to sit, and then we had no instruction. Do we wait for a server before we attend the brunch? No one came to our table for about 5 min. We asked a server passing by and they told us to proceed to the buffet. Now the time is approximately 2:10. Alot of the food was not restocked and was basically a waste of time. 

I can however say our server Ryan was excellent. He was patient, friendly, and had a great personality. He saved my experience as far as customer service. However, when I was talking to Ryan to order a drink, the same woman hostess who was rude to us in the beginning, was tapping him as I was talking to him. This is very rude considering I am the customer speaking with my server. I am pretty sure whatever she had to speak to him about could have waited. 

Overall, I will not be back. I have been to better brunch establishments with better food quality, selection, and customer service. During my tenure in college, I worked in the hospitality business so I understand great customer service."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere here- very French brasserie. Food is consistently good. So why only three stars?  Have been three or four times to check out a special they had advertised. Every time, the server or menu never mentions it, and when I ask about it... Somehow I feel like a cheapskate.   They really need to commit to their advertised specials, and not make us feel badly for wanting to take advantage of them."}
{"text":"Just finished a big family brunch here and the food was delicious and the service was perfect. Started with the beignets and they were honestly the best I've had. 

I had the French toast, light fluffy and had perfect amount of caramel sauce. Didn't lay on me at all. Everyone in my party (9 others) loved their dishes, eggs Benedict, eggs Florentines, mushroom omelets, croque madams, etc.

Everything came together, and fast considering there were ten of us. We all split desserts: pistachio creme brûlée and a fruit crepe. Super fresh and the creme brûlée was perfectly done and very unique. Will be coming back again very soon."}
{"text":"We came here as a result of the good reviews on Yelp, boy was I wrong. The onion soup was okay but the second plate... I have never tried such a horrible risotto or steak tartare in my life. The rice was hard and did not taste like it should and the color of the raw meat was dark brown and not red as it should be. The white wine (supposed to be served cold) was warm. Overall, good service but terrible food. Not coming back."}
{"text":"The Brasserie is one big cliche, from the French cafe patio furniture and French posters inside to the menu selection.  However, it stopped short of being cheesy.  The menu has those typical French dishes that you always hear about but don't usually find in restaurants.  Boeuf Bourginon, Cassoulet, Poulet grand-mere, etc.  Also a raw bar.

The food was excellent, but I would have like a bit more umph with the sides (those that came with the dishes, not a la carte).  Bread was fabulous.  I had two wines off the \"interesting wine\" section, and they were both very nice.

Service was good, and dinner was well paced even at prime time on Saturday night.

I will definitely be returning to try other dishes.  Maybe will just focus on bread, appetizers, and dessert!"}
{"text":"The food is so what decent. The first time I had the egg Benedict was perfect, other times were hit or miss. Overall, I like to come here for Sunday brunch. Love their bottomless mimosa and bloody marry."}
{"text":"Went in during Restaurant Week.  We went in before the dinner service began and had a few items off the bar feature menu.  Really good food.  Had the Mussels with chorizo, mac and cheese, Brussels sprout leaves with balsamic and a couple of glasses of wine.  Food was outstanding, the wine is a little over priced and is the only reason I didn't give the place five stars.  I know the market price of these wines and know what the other restaurants in the market charge for these items,  They need to check their wine margins."}
{"text":"I had never eaten at Georges before yesterday when I hosted a baby brunch celebration for my best friend.  The food was excellent and the staff was great!  It was nice getting to work with their event planner on coordinating everything and knowing it would all come out perfectly.  At the end of the brunch we had an issue with the check and the terms we had agreed on for the meal and the Manager was a big help.  I 100% recommend this place for your next event!"}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars but the server  exhibited extreme rudeness.  We arrived  for my birthday lunch at 2:30 and were promptly seated. It took a while for someone to come to the table, even though there were just 4 other tables of customers.  

Our server walked over and it was obvious she did not want to be there.  The rudest thing she did was laugh with the hostess whenever we requested anything, like bread and butter or a refill on our drinks!  I've been to Paris and they are much more polite.  

The mussels, escargot, Onion soup, skate and Tuna sandwich were excellent- 5 stars.  The burgers were mediocre.

I would go back just make sure you don't sit in Laura's section."}
{"text":"Me and my friends enjoyed brunch at George's Brasserie in Charlotte, NC.  We started with oysters and then ordered eggs Oscar, along with a plate of French toast.  Of course, we all enjoyed bottomless mimosas.  

Our waitress Brittain was super.  She kept our glasses full and was very attentive.  

The atmosphere was quiet and comfortable.  Most everybody was dressed in their Sunday best, but I believe nice jeans would be fine.  I enjoyed being able to talk without speaking loudly.

Sunday brunch starts at noon, and you might want yo make reservations for groups larger than four people."}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to trying those fiery mussels, but we're told the GM had decided to close the bar for the evening.  :(.  We always prefer sitting at the bar so we left.  Maybe we'll get there at another time."}
{"text":"The pork chops where cooked to perfection
No waiting to be seated.
Jason was a great server.
I Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Loved brunch here last Saturday. Indulged in some oysters and a fish ceviche as appetizer. Delivered on a 3 tiered platter with all the accouterment - oysters were so fresh and yummy.  I love raw bar food so the ceviche was right up my alley- citrus notes, plump but delicate fish chunks..washed it down with a blood mary on steroids (monster sized shrimp, celery, a bunch of other stuff) rimmed with spicy salt served in what looked like a carafe ::drool:: 

As a nice touch the bartender brought over shots on the house when he heard it was my sisters bachelorette brunch. Had eggs florentine and beignets as the finisher. Best way to start the Saturday- buzzing with a big belly. Mightve had the big belly before i came but nonetheless food was bomb."}
{"text":"I love going to George's and highly recommend it to friends. The food is always spot on, as well as the customer service. My personal favorite here is the cheese plate and a glass of Slingshot, but I also enjoyed the Slow Braised Short Rib. So good! You can enjoy a full meal here, or a nice appetizer and a drink at the bar. Travis always has great recommendations on beer and wine. 
If you haven't been here before, definitely place it on your list of things to do."}
{"text":"We decided to go to George's for Charlotte Restaurant week and we were severely disappointed.  The wait staff was exceptional...attentive without being intrusive and very helpful. Unfortunately, the food was less than inspiring.  
I'm vegan, so my boyfriend asked the waiter if he could have the chef cook something creative.  He came back and said that because it was restaurant week, the chef really couldn't do much since they were so busy.  We arrived at 6:30 and there were only 5 other tables seated at the time.  Not too busy.  The waiter came back and said that the chef could cook up some noodles in olive oil with some spring vegetables.  Sounded good.  What I got was a bowl of cool pappardelle noodles, no oil and partially steamed squash, asparagus and brussel sprouts.  They were unevenly cooked, seperate, cool to the touch and devoid of olive oil, salt or pepper.  For a restaurant with such a great reputation, they could have come up with something more impressive than that.
My brother had the short ribs - per my boyfriend's recommendation.  (He had heard that they were outstanding). They were dry, small, no braised gravy and they too were cool in temp.   He commented that it was like leftover pot roast.  
My boyfriend's meal was the ratatouille and it too was cool, lumpy and the noodles were stuck together.   
I'm giving George's two stars because it was restaurant week.  Had it not been, I would have given George's only one star."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our Valentine's Day dinner. This has been our favorite restaurant for years, and we expected the usual deliciously prepared, well-served meal. We had made a reservation two weeks in advance and requested a table away from the kitchen or entrance door. When we arrived, we were told we had two choices--the table pretty much in front  of the door or in the bar. We chose the bar area--not the ambiance we wanted with televisions on and loud music playing. 

The food was mediocre--we were never told it was a limited menu that evening, and my husband's snapper was terrible--overcooked, skin on, very ill-prepared, My vegetable ravioli was undercooked and the sauce was runny. Pretty sure the salad came to us undressed--didn't detect a bit of dressing. However, after waiting over an hour to be served, we ate what we could. The only decent part of the meal was the seafood bisque (although the diners next to us sent theirs back--they complained it was cold). 

Our server was distracted--never got the straws we requested and finally grabbed another server to bring us some bread because we were starving. Not sure we'll be back, which is a shame. Georges has been our special occasion restaurant for a long time. We never had a bad experience before this. Maybe for some people a 100 dollar plus dinner is not a big deal, but for us, it is."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food! We had a late reservation but the staff did not rush our party. Our waiter, Robert was full of good energy, and laughs! We enjoyed every minute being here!"}
{"text":"What a good time!  I am a country boy, and took my wife their on our anniversary.  I felt a little out of place to start, but I think the staff picked up on that right away and made me feel welcome.  
The complimentary Valet Parking was nice!  We had reservations and were seated right away.  Our server, Raphael, was very motivated and knowledgable.  We ordered raw oysters for an appetizer and he explained that they serve 9 different types. WOAH.  He was also very knowledgable in reccomending wine that went well with them.  I had NY Strip and my wife had Filety Mignon.  Both were about as good as it gets.  It hurt a little to spend that much money, but i had seen the menu prior to going, so it is hard to complain.  I would go there again in a heartbeat.  Our bill for 1/2 doz raw, NY strip, Filet, 2 iced teas and one glass of wine was $110.  If that is what you would expect to pay, then I highly reccomend this place to you.  I smiled the entire time I was there."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner recently. I had the Trout with cauliflower mash and green beans. It was delicious! The waitress was great and very accommodating to my concerns for buttery sauce on the fish which i didn't want. The waitress said they could put it on the side. I was worried this would make the fish taste too much for me since I'm new to eating fish but it was great! I didn't need the sauce at all! I also had the creme brûlée for dessert which was delicious and I had a bite of the chocolate cake which was also great!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Wasn't impressed. Upon entering it looks like an upscale, nice place but the dishes didn't communicate the same. Started with a Caesars salad: just your regular Caesars, nothing special. Then had a Croque Madame. Wow: I don't remember it like that at all. Been to France plenty and also french restaurants in the US, but this had nothing to do with the original. Some non-descript dressing/droux  with 2 (thick) slices of white bread and some (think) slices of ham in the middle, topped by a fried egg (that wasn't cooked long enough, the egg white was still translucent). Gotta give it to them: the fries were awesome. Service was attentive but not necessarily friendly, but maybe thats part of their \"ambiance\". So, all in all: I will probably be back for convinience (its close for lunch) and try other dishes (maybe the mussels?) but definitely nothing to write home about.  Too bad..."}
{"text":"Been 3 times and every time I'm come I order something different and it wows me
Love the sea food"}
{"text":"Excellent food , liked the atmosphere, parking a garage or Valet, entree was good, salad good, service good.  Owner is new, and seems to have a grip on things."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! Shared the petite plateau from the raw bar. It was fresh and delicious! Our server was very knowledgable. And I thought the wine was so moderately priced I wish I didn't have to hang out w my family so I could have done Easter brunch there! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"George's has an amazing brunch! I've only been here for brunch and it's the best! I would recommend it to everyone I know. They have lots of breakfast and lunch options at brunch , as well as a small \"raw bar\" and small desserts. The raw bar, desserts, salads, veggies, meats, breads and some of the other breakfast choices are buffet style. There is also a list of about 8 other dishes that you can get for free (included in the price of the brunch which is $20). All the options on this menu are delicious!!!, they cook them to order and then bring them to your table. They also have bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's- which are great! The decor inside is beautiful and they have a really nice patio."}
{"text":"I met a business associate for a very nice dinner. The staff were responsive to our needs and very personal-able. I had asked for a more private location to enable our business discussions. The staff accommodated my request, found us a nice private table, and continue to cater to our needs. The food was excellent. I would highly recommend George's."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for a Father's Day Celebration.  I thought the menu for the Brunch was very limited.  I thought there would be a few more lunch items on the menu.  We ordered the Beignets to start.  They brought us a larger order than we had ordered.  We tried to tell the server that brought them out but he didn't seem to understand.  So we started to eat when the table next to us complained to server that they hadn't received their beignets, yet.  They had 2 children with them so we knew we must have gotten their order.  The beignets were OK but seem to miss something.  I am not sure exactly what but I expected better. I also got the Bottomless Mimosa.   They are true to their word.  They brought ne a decanter  full when I asked for my second one.  I ordered a mushroom omelette that was good but not spectacular.  My husband ordered 2 eggs, bacon, hash-browns.  All was good but there was nothing spectacular.  Out waitress was very sweet. She seemed a little overwhelmed.  I think the Holiday crowd with large tables were a bit overwhelming for her.  We were patient and we were in no hurry so it all worked out. I really want to go for dinner when the menu is more extensive to see what this resturant is all about.  It is difficult to mess up eggs and an omelette.  Looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"What a charming French restaurant! The service was perfect...the food was magnificent...great ambience...prices were good. in short..a perfect evening out...at such a charming place! i definitely recommend Georges!"}
{"text":"One of my favor restaraunts here in Charlotte, moving here from a bigger city San Francisco, this place is off the hook! So good and fresh, i love the fiery mussels and fritz with a glass of red wine. Its great for something different. The service was excellent, hosts are very welcoming, the servers are very attentive and knowledgeable, the managers are very attentive as well ,helping run food out and talking to customers. This is where we go for date nights. Very romantic and quiet! I would recomend that you try at least everything on the menu"}
{"text":"Second best customer service I've ever gotten at a restaurant. Great food. Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"I travel to Paris quite often and have had some yummy and not so yummy French food.
That being said I truly enjoyed this Brasserie.  I was out on a balmy sunny Friday and I turned into Piedmont Center parked my car and thought I'd check out the 3 restaurants an decided  on George's.  Can I say I left Happy French!!!! 
I will return to try everything on the menu eventually.
I gave it a 5 star, but the wait staff never asked if I wanted dessert before bringing the bill. Sometimes dessert is an added treat."}
{"text":"This place is good for drinks and oysters in the bar area, but really that's it.  We have given them 2nd, 3rd, and 4th chances and are now done.  I really like the feel of the place and have had a few dishes that were good, which is why I guess we have tried to like it.  The last time we went we had a crab cake that I'm sure had been frozen and reheated.  It was so dry with no discernable crab.  

We sat in the dining room once and there was butter all over the booth seat from the previous diners. We told the hostess and she just looked at us with a blank stare, we were like can you get someone to clean this, she unhappily complied. So strange.  Mostly the problem is bad service and inconsistent food that is often under seasoned.  Wish they would get it together, it would be great to have an authentic French brasserie in Charlotte and it's a beautiful space.  Speaking of French brasseries, don't even get me started on Cafe Monte!"}
{"text":"True rating : 3.5. Yelp has really got to start letting us give .5 stars!!

First off, my waitress was great, incredibly friendly. The food was okay, nothing exceptional. The scallops were probably my favorite part of the dinner -- a little overseasoned, but cooked perfectly. The beef bourgignon was okay, very little meat though. But props for the in-house-made pasta. Then for dessert, I had the warm chocolate cake. One word -- yum! The caramel ice cream (also made in house) was very good as well. Over all, pleasant dinner, but it would not be my first choice restaurant for a night out. 

As always, complimentary valet (thank you Piedmont Town Center). 

Décor was okay, but loved the old school Vogue cover pictures (of course I would appreciate that being the Vogue lover that I am!)"}
{"text":"French onion soup, escargot and pomme frites  were excellent. Fillet and strip were excellent quality but extremely over cooked. Medium rare was medium well. Will give it another try though. Staff  and service were great!"}
{"text":"Vacillating between three and four stars.  It always seems there's just something that goes wrong with the service here -- not a catastrophe, but just \"off.\". That being said, if you like a real hamburger cooked rare, good luck finding a better one in South Park, if not south Charlotte.  Service gripes notwithstanding, we do always seem to have fun here, and it seems most of the other tables are having fun too.  That counts for a lot!  Agree with other reviews noting both peaks and valleys on the menu ... Hard to say this place really nails it, and yet it is unique (for the area) and we just keep coming back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a restaurant close to our hotel to unwind and have a nice dinner after the Panthers game.   Luckily we found Georges.  It was walking distance from the hotel. 
The hostess was friendly and sat us on their outdoor patio. The patio has a smooth level of ambiance.  Our table had a nice view of the fountain in the middle of the plaza.  I immediately started to enjoy myself.  Our waitress was prompt and helpful answering all of our questions and making recommendations.
The drinks arrived quickly which is always a good start to my ideal dining experience.   Although they had an excellent and varied selection including what looked to be an outstanding raw bar, I decided to order the NY Strip Au Poivre with brandy-peppercorn sauce and french fries.
Although my steak came out closer to Medium than the medium- rare I ordered it was a good cut, flavorful and juicy. The sauce complimented the steak well.  The shoestring french fries came out hot and crispy which almost never happens .
I can't say enough good things about the service.  All staff encountered was very professional and the service was seamless.
I'm looking forward to coming back and trying something from the raw bar next time."}
{"text":"Warm considerate friendly staff, I just arrived in Charlotte and already feel like part of the family.  A special request was accommodated, ensuring I will be a loyal customer for ever."}
{"text":"Inside the house: Perfect! Great large shrimp, good oysters and wonderful creme brulee! GB omelette with mushrooms and goat cheese was large and flavorful. Service was impeccable. Shrimp n grits was creamy and nice amount of shrimp. Great food and great Sunday brunch value.

Outside the house: GB would be better to not have valet parking than what is there. One star off just for valet service."}
{"text":"So disappointed and i cant even comment on the food. My husband made reservations at Georges for Saturday night. We have been about 3 times and have had fabulous food and wonderful service each time. We were looking so forward to a date night as they are few and far between with my husbands schedule. When we arrived the restaurant was about 60% full. The hostess escorted us to our table, probably the worst table in the place! It was a four top right in the middle of the room and in the direct path of the kitchen. I quickly glanced around and saw probably 3 or 4 better options. My husband asked for another table and she said ok but we we would have to wait a bit. Oh, and we could have a drink in the bar while we waited. Really? 
We stood and waited in the middle of the bar for about 10 minutes and observed her do nothing to find us another table. We decided to leave since our seldom evenings out are too valuable. When my husband told her, she could have cared less! We decided go to Upstream where we had an incredible dining experience at a nice intimate table for two! Don't think we'll go back :("}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to dine at in Charlotte! Love their selection and quality of oysters! Can't forget their mussels as well! Definitely wasn't a huge fan of either before coming here. The oysters are fresh and have a clean taste. My favorites are the kumamotos and shigokus. Their mussels are perfectly cooked and plump! The broth they are cooked in is killer and addicting. Love using the shells to slurp up the broth! I definitely did not know oysters and mussels could taste this good before coming here! In addition, everything I've tried on the menu has been awesome, really can't go wrong with anything in my opinion. If you enjoy brunch, I definitely recommend their Sunday brunch too! I especially love sitting out on the patio when the weather is warm!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been one of my favorites. However, last night we took another couple to dinner here bragging about how great the food was.  It was so disappointing.  My NY strip steak was just awful.  Full of nerve and hard to even cut with the steak knives they provide.  It had no taste at all.  My husband ordered the duck which was not very good either.   Our friends ordered scallops and the trout which the winning dish seemed to be the trout.  
I so wanted to send my food back but was embarrassed since I bragged so much to my friends how great this place was.  Not sure I would ever go back.  George is taking the cheap way out with food but charging a big price"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday last Friday for lunch. Benjamin was our waiter and made our experience exceptional! I chose George's Brassiere based on the menu and knew my family would find something scrumptious! Delicious delicious delicious!! I recommend this restaurant to anyone and ask for Benjamin!!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for new breakfast joints in Charlotte and am often disappointed. When I found out that Georges serves brunch, I called up my friend and said we had to give it a try. We decided to meet there this morning and lets just say I am now in love....

The restaurant is adorable. There are photos from Vogue all over the walls, my inner fashionista was screaming. We sat down and were greeted by our very friendly waiter. I ordered a cup of coffee and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was really delicious and actually pretty strong. 

We started with the beignets which were very fluffy and very delicious. We quickly scarfed those down and placed our order for Steak and Eggs Filet Mignon and I am very, very happy I did. 

The steak and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The steak was rare and incredibly flavorful and the eggs were perfectly poached. The hollandaise was some of the best I have ever had. The potatoes on the side weren't the best I've ever had, that would be my only complaint. 

In addition to the fantastic food, our waiter was incredible. I never saw the bottom of my coffee cup or water glass. He gave us suggestions of what to order and when we told him it was our first time dining at Georges, he brought us the dinner menu so we could take a look and see if we wanted to come back for dinner some time. I was very, very pleased with the service and the food. I plan to go back soon for dinner and of course, for brunch."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a number of times and love that it's not a pick-up joint atmosphere like the other restaurants at Piedmont Town Center have become. The service is always impeccable, but not too 'hovering.' The food is always outstanding. I've taken my sister & hubby here several times and as picky San Fran residents, they always rave. Their prices are extremely reasonable for the quality and presentation of the food and their wine selections are fabulous. I always enjoy my time here and feel leaving the money spent was well worth it."}
{"text":"We made reservations for Georges Brasserie for Queen's Feast weekend. It's the only restaurant we've chosen so far this time around. 

I was surprised to receive a phone call two days before our dinner to confirm our reservation. The caller asked me if I had an indoor/outdoor seating preference, and reminded me that Queen's Feast was going on. Calling to confirm was a nice touch, just like reservations used to be way back in the good ol' days.

We were seated as soon as we arrived. Doug was our server, and he did a fantastic job. We brought a special wine from our cellar, which Doug uncorked and served to us. ($15 corkage fee.)  The service was absolutely perfect, from beginning to end.

More amazing than the splendid service, however, was the food. My husband ordered the mussels. I can't eat or try mussels because I have developed an allergy, so I can't say firsthand how they tasted, or even how the broth tasted. What I CAN say is that I've never seen my husband so happy about his food. I asked him if I needed to leave him and the mussels alone for a moment. My husband said, and I quote, \"I have not had anything better since I had that escargot in Beaune, France.\" Now, you need to realize he puts that dinner in Beaune up on a pedestal. That's his baseline for ultimate perfection. So to put the mussels in that category was the highest compliment he's paid any restaurant in Charlotte, ever.

I had the Vichyssoise myself, and I loved it. I may not have had the affair with my first course that my husband had with his, but it was damned good. The best I've had in the area as well.

Our main courses were solid, but not as surprisingly awesome as the first course. My husband had the short ribs, which he liked, but said were on par with other places in town. I had the chicken (I know, I'm so BORING!) which I ordered  primarily because I was interested in the black garlic buerre blanc. It was delicious and I really enjoyed it.

We both agreed on flourless chocolate cakes for our dessert. Again with the ooh-ing and the aah-ing. My husband and I both agreed it was the best, and probably most rich, flourless chocolate cake we'd ever had. Perfectly moist, almost like a mousse, and very delicious. I appreciated that the raspberry coulis was an accent on the plate and not on the cake, as I don't like raspberries very much.

Based on that one meal, we will certainly be back for lunches and dinners. Georges Brasserie was hands-down, the nicest meal I've ever had for Charlotte Restaurant week. You have another week to get there, so make your reservations. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a shocker this place was! 
To see some notable South Park Restaurant Faces, you know its gunna be good! 
I met a friend for what was supposed to be drinks at the bar. As I walked in, I noticed that Georges has really done well with the former Oceanaire space that just wasnt conducive to high volume. We sat at the bar as there were plenty of free chairs and were greeted kindly by barmen, James and Brandon. Brandon is a SouthPark staple who knows customer service and what his guests want! In no time, I had his newly created \"Sassy\" Martini, which was just that! Delish! My friend ordered her usual Chopin up, which proved to be as stiff as she likes them! We chatted as we looked at the menu and surroundings and just felt at home! I ordered a dozen Gigamoto Oysters which came with usual accompaniments for dipping and NO CRACKERS! This is a welcomed surprise, you have to eat the oyster with a fork and not a cracker! Amazing. They were fresh and firm, with that creaminess you get from anything with a \"-moto\". After the oysters, we ordered the Steak Tartare, Chicken Liver Pate, Goat Cheese Tarte, and Escargot (it was an appetizer night). The Appetizer menu had something for everyone. You can really tell that so much time and effort was taken to create this great menu! The Steak Tartare was some of the best ive had, the chicken liver was a perfect mix of creamy and firm (kinda like the oysters!). The Goat cheese didnt last long enough to review, but i hear it was good. The Escargot, in my opinion, was prepared the way it should be, SIMPLE. Butter, Garlic, Parsley, no salt. Let the snails and the butter do the work! Little balls of puff pastry topped each snail and offered an excellent texture contrast. Not one of the snails was gritty. I just think this dish was a triumph! 
Id say I was hard pressed to find a single thing critical about my visit to Georges and will Definitely be back to go after some entrees! A s we just sat at the bar, the decor was warm, inviting, and the staff was knowledgeable. With the amount of talent in the building, this place is sure to be sucessful. I cant wait for many more nights at the great restaurant. Helen will review it, and I will be sure not to listen."}
{"text":"I may have found my new favorite restaurant!  I dined at Georges Brasserie last weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday, and had a wonderful time.  The food was great, and the service even better!  Our group of five was seated on the lovely patio.  We started off with a cheese plate, and our server was so helpful and well informed.  He explained the different selections, and made excellent wine and beer recommendations as well (try the Blanche de Bruxelles) .  The complimentary bread and butter was terrific.  My filet mignon was cooked to perfection, and my companions enjoyed their meals of duck and a grouper special  Finally we ordered a creme brulee to share for dessert, and it was served with a birthday candle and a chocolate \"Happy Birthday\" decoration.  

We loved our visit and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I will definitely be back, and try to sit on the patio once again."}
{"text":"Georges Brasserie is a definite Charlotte favorite of mine. This restaurant has it all - great food, excellent ambience, and impeccable service. Look around at the other diners and notice that everyone is smiling for the same reason you will be if you check out this restaurant.

Latest visit happened to be during restaurant week. I started with a wonderful French martini.  My selections were a  pork belly appetizer, short ribs for an entree and Tahitian vanilla creme brulee for dessert. I think I had a dream about the creme brulee last night!

Pork belly was tasty and tender with just the right amount of crispness on top. The short ribs made for a wise choice. Extremely tender, flavorful and a delight to my palate.  It is imperative that you save room for dessert. If you love creme brulee, beat a path to Georges immediately."}
{"text":"This is a classic looks  better than it tastes.  The entree was better than the first course. It's old school trout almandine.   The butternut squash soup With smoked duck was flat. One note. The sauces were done   well.   
The place was virtually empty on Wednesday so our waitress could have been more attentive.  She seemed in a hurry. For what I was unsure.  when our waitress was around I found her to be curt.  That rubbed me the wrong way. 
This was actually my second time at this place, I had also been for brunch.  Didn't realize I had been there until pulled up. So it's forgettable.  Too many other french restos in this city to visit this sub-par place again.  
One other picky note is that they had salt and pepper griders on the table.  It is hard to recall a fine dining establishment where I have seen that in the past 5 years.  Im a believer of a chef seasoning the dish appropriately and a fresh pepper mill being brought to the table by the waitstaff."}
{"text":"George's is located in the flashy circle drive of Piedmont Row in Southpark.  It has a well appointed environment, with a large bar area and a separate dining area.  Since it was restaurant week I took advantage of the special menu and had a delicious mixed green salad with fried brie, pears and walnuts; a nice snapper dish and a tasty chocolate mousse.  Some of my table mates ordered a platter of oysters and they looked awesome as well.  I also sampled a dish someone else got with short rib in some kind of casserole mixture served in a cast iron skillet.  It was probably my favorite bite of the evening.  Very tasty and filling.  Prices were, as expected, high and they were busy that evening so service was slightly slow.  However, the solid food, very comfortable environment and super friendly service made our dinner at George's memorable."}
{"text":"I consider a 5 star review a place that I will take visitors when the come to Charlotte. Well, we have taken many visitors to Georges and they still talk about their experience to this day. I say that warrants an upgrade to 5 star!

We have been to Georges many times since the discovery from my initial review. Bottomless mussels on Tuesday for $15, check. Steak dinner out, check. We have not made it to the brunch and that is super sad and needs to be added to our bucket list. 

The firery mussels deserve a paragraph on their own. We came to Georges last night for a mid-week date and literally just got the fiery mussels. It was enough for two. I am not sure if I am embarrassed or proud to say we also killed 3 baskets of bread with the mussels....I mean that sauce is so amazing that is HAS to be soaked up with something. If you go to Georges and do not order the Fiery Mussels, you are doing it wrong. 

I also enjoy the oysters here. Also so fresh with a nice presentation. They are $1 on Fridays! Last night I had one east coast and one west coast. Both absolutely fantastic. In a previous visit, I tried the steak, which was excellently cooked. 

Wine selection is excellent! Service has always been spot on for us as well!"}
{"text":"George's is a phenomenal French restaurant.  I went to George's for a Valentine's dinner after recently returning from France.  It mildly compares to the George's in Lyon, but it's still a decent fine dining option in Charlotte. High price - High quality service."}
{"text":"I like trying new places for my birthday, but unfortunately my birthday was on a Sunday this year, and lots of great restaurants are closed on a Sunday.  Jerks.  So after my third or fourth try (after Lulu, Good Food, and something else I can't remember were closed), I came across Georges.  I've been to Del Frisco's in Piedmont Row (delicious) and Brio (eh), but I like good French food, so Georges it was.  The weather was absolutely gorgeous, so we sat outside and had just a lovely meal.  It started out with a cheese plate (chef's choice, and he chose well!) that had a couple of special kinds of cheddars I'm going to hunt down, then I ended up with the Grouper special, which was really delicious with a delicate smoked tomato sauce.  The creme on this dinner was a creme brulee (with Happy Birthday printed on edible dark chocolate...come on!) that was so thick and creamy.  All in all, a light, fresh, perfect meal.

A special shout-out (I feel like I'm on Total Request Live right now, which is an incredibly dated reference) to our waiter Ryan, who was just wonderful.  Right there when we needed him, charming, and helpful.  And he comped my creme brulee, which makes him (and Georges) even better!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop here spontaneously for an early dinner on our trip home. We arrived early and were seated a the bar for drinks while we waited for dinner service to begin. Once seated we started with a plate of cheeses selected by our server Robert. All of the cheeses were absolutely delicious, but the Red Dragon stood out as exceptional. I ordered pan seared sea scallops with the pappardelle mushroom pasta. The entire dish was perfectly cooked. My wife ordered the slow braised short ribs. They were tender and flavorful. She followed this with a pumpkin creme brûlée for dessert which was generous in size and delicious. This was one of my all time favorite meals and restaurant experiences. The food was terrific and the service was outstanding. We highly recommend requesting Robert if he is available. His recommendations were superb and his British accent was charming."}
{"text":"We went during restaurant week and boy did we make the right decision or what! This place has some amazing food you can get in charlotte. Right from the drinks till desert, every item hit home run for us. The mussels in white wine and scottish salmon dish was absolutely delicious. Our server was not that friendly but who cares about the server when you are in food heaven."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal at Georges.  Service was very cordial and pacing was relaxed (which we prefer, some may call it slow).  I would have to say my filet was slightly overcooked but the bernaise , frites and haricots verts were great.

Nice selection of wines and Belgian / Craft beers."}
{"text":"George's is a great spot for an after work drink. Also can't beat the oyster special with $1 oysters on fridays. Had lunch a couple of times and have never been disappointed. I am definitely going to try George's for dinner soon."}
{"text":"SUNDAY BRUNCH REVIEW ONLY.

I enjoyed the food. I like the concept of the brunch entrees that you order at the table and it comes out in small portions so you get the chance to try out the actual buffet. My boyfriend and I love the shrimp and grits. The grits is so creamy and the shrimps are actually really big. The sauce on top comes off a little too sweet for our liking but that doesn't stop us from ordering 4 more plates. $12 bottomless mimosas, can't beat that. No complaints there. 

Services wise.. Not so great. We were seated by the host and then ignored for the next 10 minutes. None of the servers came by but they all seem to notice we were sitting there. And keep in mind, it wasn't all that busy. Two servers finally came by and  asked for our drinks. Server brought out my boyfriend's drink order and then completely forgets about mine. The rest of our party arrives and none of the servers came by the take our orders. When we finally ordered, the server forgot the last half of our orders after he brought out our first half. And the two servers that were introduced to us, rarely checked up on us.


Ever had that \"damnit\" moment where you leave a hefty tip for the server and walked out thinking why the hell you tipped that much because they didn't really deserve it. No? Just me? Okay.."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here last night, and was very pleased with the meal and service. The steak and frites was excellent, as was the salmon ravioli special. The portion size on both of those entrees was quite good. My husband had the blackened tuna, which he enjoyed, but the portion size was a bit small. We were quite surprised compared to the other two entrees. There was one minor service issue, but it was immediately corrected, and they gave me a complimentary second dessert for the table in addition to my birthday dessert. If you like Creme Brulee, order it here...it was outstanding!! Overall, myself, my husband and my father all really enjoyed this restaurant, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service but very poor food.  I am surprised  to see all the 4 and 5 star ratings.  I had mussels with Dijon sauce and sautéed duck breast for my dinner.  The mussel sauce was excellent but there were far more empty shells than mussels in the pot.  It seemed like the mussels were cooked in a big pot some time ago, some scooped out and the selected sauce poured over to serve. Most of the mussels were left in the big pot.  Accompanying bread was excellent.  The duck breast was an example of sous vide gone wrong.  I ordered medium rare and it was very slightly pink all the way through with a very thin tough exterior.  This effect cannot be achieved sautéing in a pan.  The accompanying roasted brussel sprout sweet potato hash would have been excellent if the potatoes had not been cooked until mushy. Review finished."}
{"text":"My first time here today with the family. We had 11:30 am reservations. It seemed like they sat the wrong family under my reservation, but we were seated quickly after they realized their mistake. We were greeted by our waiter Phil. He was very informative since we were newbies. The breakfast brunch buffet was great. My favourites were the oysters, omelette station, prime rib and the creme brulee. My husband and children also enjoyed it. I inquired about the bottomless mimosa deal. I was informed that they no longer offer that. The alternative is to purchase a $14.99 bottle of champagne and they give you unlimited orange juice with it. Overall, we had a great experience. The food was delicious and our waiter Phil was very attentive. We will go back."}
{"text":"Went for the Queens Feast. Excellent cerviche, veal short ribs, chocolate mousse & coffee. Blush mojito with fresh berries was great! Tyrell was the best waiter we have had in our 3 years of dining in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Flawless! Brunch outside on a nice day is perfection at George's. Lovely patio seating with the view of the fountain. Service (by Kate) is impeccable. Shrimp & Grits is worth checking on. It's a special and not available every Sunday. Worth the wait. Spectacular! (As always.)"}
{"text":"The service and the ambience are most enjoyable. In fact, if those are your two greatest needs, I would go here. They also offer valet service for \"free\".
As to the food. No true complaints just a heads up...some is exceptionally ordinary but the atmosphere and service and all I suppose give way to the upcharge. 
If and when I go back, I would make sure to order something I do not make or cannot get down the street."}
{"text":"While visiting NC , this is one of the places was offering thanksgiving buffet. Upon seating I got there a little earlier than scheduled time and was seated promptly. Service superb, and food tasted very good . All sides were delicious. More of formal environment . Highly recommend at least for thanksgiving buffet but will definitely try their Sunday brunch . You are on top of my list to try on my next visit here ."}
{"text":"During my trip to Charlotte, NC, my family and I had an opportunity to dine at George's Brasserie. It is now one of my favorite French restaurants and I am sad that it's all the way in the East Coast!

Loved their elegant yet cozy/homie atmosphere that was accompanied by friendly service that made me feel very welcome. The food was just phenomenal! Each dish had its own unique flavor which kept me wanting more even after I was full.

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is one of my top five in Charlotte. I ate here twice in two days. The happy hour deals are excellent as is the lamb. If you are in the area it is highly recommended.

{"text":"Can I please get a half star up in this piece? Because with my experience at George's, it would be useful so I could give it a 3.5. Like Nicole, I expected more from George's. I don't know what I was expecting per se but just more. I went for Restaurant Wk and they have a varied menu list that would make an omnivore, pescatarian and vegetarian happy. The starters ranged from soup to mixed greens to shrimp and the main entree menu had chicken, spinach and mushroom crepes, snapper and short ribs. The dessert menu offered rich desserts such as creme brulee, chocolate mousse and apple tart. Service was absolutely out of this world and I couldn't have asked for more plus they have really cute servers, nothing like some eye candy while dining--hi boys!. Our server explained the wine list to me since I was intrigued by the whole \"Interesting\" section and how it compared to the merlots, cabernets, etc. He was on point with filling our bread basket along with refills and was prompt with taking our order. They don't have a huge waiting area in the front, just two chairs with gets a little uncomfortable with the cold draft with the door opening and closing. I didn't get to check out the bar area but it seemed spacious and they have a huge patio area that would be fun to kick back on with a couple glasses of wine during the summer. The restroom location is a little obscure. It's on the way to the kitchen so as you're walking through the hallway, your dodging servers and restaurant staff. 

The food is where George's let me down. It was good don't get me wrong but nothing that made me want to foodgasm. The mixed green salad was my favorite with candied pecans, pears, red onions and gasp---fried brie?? Any kind of fried cheese is welcome in my belly. The snapper was fresh and meaty but lacked flavor. The lobster under it was a nice touch and was good but it seemed a bit dry. The basmati rice both were laid on was just mush without flavor. Totally edible but no one flavor popped out at me. The apple tart was decadent and enjoyable and it seemed to come with whipper cream that tasted like it was homemade. One of the guests in my party was celebrating a birthday and they brought out a chocolate lava cake without us even asking---sweet--literally. 

All in all, I had a nice time but was hoping for more. I would go back again to give George's a second chance though. It's like the ex boyfriend I had a good time with yet go back to b/c I want to believe they have some good in them. Now if someone can explain the big bowl of oranges in the front, I would appreciate it."}
{"text":"We went for Valentine's Day Dinner & walked out after paying $174 bill for 2 dinners ($65 x 2), 2 glasses of wine & 2 bottles of Perrier. It was meh & that's sad to say after spending that kind of money. I had the scallop dinner...scallops were great but the risotto was crunchy & not fully cooked. Next time we will go the day before Valentine's Day so we can order off the normal menu & get normal portions instead of 1/2 versions."}
{"text":"We went here for a weeknight dinner with a friend, and we had a fantastic meal.  I love French Brasseries a lot, and this one is high on my list now! Wish I'd been here sooner.  The first time we'd been here was to grab a coffee when they had a concert in the courtyard in front of the place this summer, and knew we wanted to check it out.

Anyway, we had the Chorizo Mussels to start, which are amazing! They give you a ton, so make sure you're hungry and that everyone is going to help out.  I had the pork chop, which was in the top 3-4 that I've had anywhere, and I get them a lot.  They do it sous vide, and then flash saute it after to give it an awesome crust.  I really loved it, and can't wait to get it again.  I don't remember what everyone else had, but they all loved it.  Great place for a romantic but relaxed dinner, and a good place to take friends too for a good meal and a chill night out in Paris."}
{"text":"Visited George's last week and had another great time! Service was excellent. I was disappointed with my entree this time. I loved the pork chop so much last time so I decided to have it again. This time the pork was over done and not flavorful at all. I was so disappointed. They change their menu around so I knew I wouldn't be getting the exact same presentation and taste as last time, but this pork chop was just bleh. I think I'll try something new next time. Everyone else in my party was thrilled with their entrees and cocktails. We will be back! Just won't get the pork chop :/"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service! Best hospitality in Charlotte! Make sure to check out the raw bar, and the pork chop is amazing."}
{"text":"Great classic french bistro food. Excellent service. Fun vibe."}
{"text":"Experienced a lovely dinner tonight.

Food - This is the most important element at a restaurant and the three of us tried an assortment of starters. 

1) Onion soup - good broth, the toast could have been crunchier and there could have been more cheese, but overall, a decent version of an overdone classic

2) Ceviche with scallops and lobster. Very tasty!

3) Country pate + duck rillets + some ham and nice mustard - solid. I preferred the duck, others at the table preferred the pate, but we all liked the mustard

4) Special entree - scallops over risotto - simply divine. A bit pricey for three scallops - not sure if they needed to be crab stuffed, but the scallops themselves were sweet and divine and the risotto was awesome

5) Gnocchi with lobster - melted in mouth and the sauce was heart attack delicious

6) Escargot - I'd say the weakest dish. Suggest you pass on this one. Out of the shell and with silly small pastry on top of each snail

Service - excellent! Our waiter was very gracious and attentive and good timing and pacing on the food and wine and bread service

Ambiance - Low key, not too pretentious. Lots of space between tables. The owners didn't seem to have changed much from the previous seafood restaurant (which was pretty good, so sad to see that it closed)

Price - Not cheap, but not out of line.

Butter - would have liked the butter colder/more solid. the bread was awesome and I appreciated the manager (?) bringing fresh out of the oven bread mid way in the meal.

Parking - free valet - nice. Would have appreciated if the waiter had gotten the car for us. Not a big deal

I prefer this place to Nobles - which apparently has closed. So I guess this is the place to go to!"}
{"text":"DateNight done right on a nice weather night. We've tried Georges several times and it's the best visit when we are on a Date and trying to focus on just us (no children with us or any friends with us).

The mussels are amazing the fiery mussels are our FAV. We tend to enjoy the chef special ( one or two of them ) as they are typically items that are local and not common on the menu and they tend to pack plenty of seasonal flavor plus my hubby and I like to try each other food to expand our taste of what a restaurant has to offer.

We usually have a seamlessly smooth visit to this place with the exception of one occasion which happened during restaurant week. As you know the menu is pre-fix 3 courses which is standard. The menu stated \" no substitutions\" and we understood that however I don't take it as a substitution if I ask to have my salad WITHOUT the pork. Call me crazy but simply removing an item isn't substitution I didn't ask that it be replaced with something else I ask to not have it added as we don't eat pork. We were given the run around and told we couldn't do that. I had to go all the way to the point of speaking with a manager. The pork was then removed and we completed our dinner DateNight. This incident is why I had to remove a star as it should never be that hard to not ingest something you don't eat ."}
{"text":"The place is georgous! The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We went there twice on our trip to Charlotte and the food was delicious. My favorite was the white wine mussels. I would definitely come back whenever I'm back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We visited Georges again this past weekend.  Our second visit was just as good as the first!  This time, though, it was extremely cold outside, so we didn't have to make the decision about eating inside or out.  The outside patio is nice, but you don't get the full ambiance of the restaurant unless you eat indoors (which we did this time around).  The decor and interior are gorgeous.  When I think of a fairly upscale French restaurant, Georges is what I picture.  They're not so uptight, rigid, and formal, though, that you have dress to the nines.  \"Smart casual,\" opentable.com says.  

We were greeted by a very friendly and well-dressed young woman who immediately and professionally seated us.  Our server, Wade, came next, and he was fantastic.  He was also dressed very well, but was very down-to-earth.  He openly and knowledgeably talked about the menu, the food preparation, and the ingredients without sounding condescending.  

After the complimentary crunchy French bread was brought to our table, all three of us started with the French Onion soup.  It was different than any other French onion soup I've ever had before.  It was very sweet-tasting, and Wade explained that it was because they use sweet Vidalia onions.  

I had had the Beef Bourguignon last time and loved it, but I wanted to try something different this time.  I chose the Cassoulet (cass-o-lay) because I had remembered recently seen a recipe for one and thought it sounded good.   It came out in a cast iron oven skillet, sizzling hot.   This one came with duck and pork confit which, after seeing a few chunks of fat in the dish, I later looked up and learned (as I suspected) that \"confit\" meant that it was meat cooked in its own fat.  I'm not a big fan of eating chunks of fat, but luckily it was hidden (or I buried it) underneath the rest of the ingredients.  There was also sausage, white beans, spices, and a thick, tomatoe-y sauce in it.  I'd probably go back to the Beef Bourguignon or try another dish next time.   I can't slight Georges on the cassoulet, though, because that's what the dish consists of.  The flavor of the dish was fantastic, and it and was perfectly prepared, but because of the chunks of fat, I just couldn't order it again.

I also ordered a glass of wine with dinner -- the cheapest Merlot on the menu.  Don't let the pricing fool you, though.  It was deliciously mild for a Merlot wine.  I loved it.  

Georges has become one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  I hope to return some day soon to try their Sunday brunch options!"}
{"text":"My husband and I checked out George's for restaurant week and overall it wasn't terrible but I would like to try it on a normal night. We ended up not taking part in the Queens feast because my husband wasn't impressed with the app options and I honestly just wanted the Creme Brûlée ( which was so so). He got the steak (because he's a man) and I opted for the pork chops. He was satisfied. The pork chop was good, not great and my mac n cheese was dry and over cooked which was the complete opposite of my husbands side of mac and cheese ( I know, weird). But as I stated to be fair I would like to try again when they aren't as busy."}
{"text":"Went here recently and sat outside on their large patio. I was here when it was the Oceanaire, but hadn't been back to the space since it closed. The patio is extensive and the inside, though there only briefly, was nice too. They have a limited beer menu, but most of the beer choices are local to NC, which I like. Went with the Highland Ale (a few) and it was good, and went well with what we ordered for dinner. 

Ordered the goat cheese & onion tart to begin and it was great. Comes out like a quiche for you non-tart folks :). Tasty and the consistency was nice. For my entree went with the lamb shank (see pic on biz page photos). While it's doesn't \"look\" appetizing, it sure was. Meet fell off the bone as it's braised, and was served on top of a serving of polenta. Only issue, if you want to call it one, was that there was so much food, I could only get through about 1/2 of it. For $25, it was worth it and won't leave you hungry. 

Went with the creme brulee for dessert and this was the only disappointment for me in the meal. The sugar crust was over done and the taste of the brulee was not to my liking. No worries, just won't order it next time. Can't wait to try this place for brunch as the reviews are good!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Georges Brasserie for happy hour so I can't comment on their full menu or service but as far as happy hour goes, It's always a happy hour indeed. 

We have tried the mussels with chorizo, the steak with pommes frites, their oysters and the crispy Brussels leaves with a fantastic balsamic drizzle. Everything has tasted so great each time we order it and for the fact that each dish is either $1, $5, or $7, it is a lot of food. The mussels are some of my favorite, it is a huge bowl of mussels with a great broth, tons of chorizo, and their bread is fantastic. The steak is enough for two to share, cooked well and with delicious pommes frites. 

If you only get one thing off my list, the crispy brussels leaves is where it is at. They are cooked perfectly and the balsamic drizzle is 'lick the plate' delicious. We actually got a second order because we each wanted our own, that's how good they were. 

The oyster deal is pretty great too considering their usual cost and they also have a few drink specials, though we usually just get wine. All in all, I really like GB for Happy Hour and have actually wanted to come for a full dinner (review to follow).  The service is always great near the bar, the food comes out quickly, and we leave happy. If you're looking for a good happy hour, add GB to your list!"}
{"text":"This review is for Sunday Brunch only as I have not been there for dinner...yet.  My wife and I met some friends for brunch this Sunday and I have to say the overall experience was positive.  

The Bloody Marys are heavy on the horseradish, which I like, so if you aren't a fan, steer clear.  The Eggs Norwegian, Eggs Oscar, and Croque-Madame were very well received at the table.  Cappuccino was also excellent.

While ordering a friend was asking about a quiche de jour and the server must have mistook this for an order, because his Eggs Oscar didn't come out, and a quiche did.  The server apologized, and allowed us to keep the quiche as they quickly fixed his order and comped both dishes for my friend.  This was unnecessary, but appreciated.  

Funny part to the story is, the highlight of the entire meal was the one we didn't order. The quiche de jour which was ham and spinach to the best of my recollection, hands down the best  have ever had in my life.  Light, fluffy creamy, great consistency, I can't say enough.  Next time in, this will be my selection with out a doubt."}
{"text":"Only been once but I can't wait to go back!! 

We had three of us in our party and decided to just sit at the bar, good thing Summer and Stella were A-Mazing!! I walked in and had a Pear Martini waiting for me God I LOVE my friends, and this drink, it was so good!! They have a great Happy Hour menu that last all night. ( I think)

We started ordering off of the Happy Hour menu and we had the Tuna Bites- I really liked them they were like Tuna Tar-Tar on little wasabi crackers. French Country Pizza was really good too!! Shrimp Cocktail- comes with 4 you have to peel yourself but well worth it, they were big and delicious!! We had the Escargot, I opted out, not my thing!! We had the Truffle Frites anything with truffle is good with me!! 

Ok we had a lot of different things I can't remember everything now but I will say we had a great time picking through both menus offered and had a an even better time just ordering as we went!! I like Georges and will definitely recommend!! Sit at the bar its more fun!!"}
{"text":"Had reservations here yesterday for Mother's Day. We arrive 1:20 reservation 1:30. The line is out the door. We wait get to hostess stand and we're told they are running way behind. At least 45 minutes. There were a number of large groups before us. It was 95 doors open people crowded everywhere. We waited a few more minutes and decided to leave. You had to try to go through crowds just to get the food.  It was insane! We were now 9 people with nowhere to go. Very disappointing that we wanted to have a celebration lunch for Mother's Day and was so looking forward to it. Either they took people walking in or took too many reservations . Not good!"}
{"text":"A wonderful dining experience. From an informed waiter to an engaged and talented chef--it was a great experience that made me feel I l was a step from the Eiffel Tower. Clearly this is an establishment that \"gets it\" and \"serves it\"."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite brunch spot - for $25 you get an all-you-can-eat buffet with everything you can imagine plus small plates. The service was above and beyond anything I've experience during a buffet and the food and coffee were delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Georges' dinning hall was reserved through 9PM on this Saturday evening. We arrived around 9pm and sat in the bar/lounge area, which was perfectly fine.  We ordered the cheese plate, charcutere, torchon de foie gras,duck liver and truffle mousse, prosciutto di parma, rosette de lyon. It was tasty and I strongly recommend it.  The North Carolina oysters were fresh, on the smaller side, they have special $1 for one on Tuesdays. The onion soup was one of the better ones I have had. Entrees, don't expect big portions, it's not what this place is about. The monk fish was wrapped in prosciutto, placed on top of ratatouille and toasted quinoa ragout, the inside of the fish was very tender, recommended.  Scallops, came with three not the four you see in the posted pics. Nice sizes, the outside were crisp, together with the salad frisee salad,and candied pistachios, the taste was balanced.  However I did feel the inside was slightly under cooked.   there is a restaurant week going on now. ran by Chef Jeff Schriber."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for fresh oysters, this is the place for you! Great, friendly service by staff who make feel right at home."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch, we arrived earlier in the day and were seated outside. It was all brunch but you could order beignets (overdone), eggs Benedict ( really runny) and we also ordered shrimp and grits. All were ok! We had to ask several times for the beignets and Benedict's before receiving. The food ran low quickly inside when we went in, always seemed to miss it I guess??? I've had dinner at George's and it was amazing, this was not what I was expecting for their brunch. Our server disappeared and overall for Mother's Day out, I cannot say it was a horrible experience but expected more out of this place. 

I would give it 5 stars for my dinner experience."}
{"text":"Refined yet, laid back dining in a friendly and sophisticated atmosphere, serving food of the highest quality in lovely surroundings. I can't wait to try the Sunday buffet!"}
{"text":"Mother's Day. 

Massive fail!

There were empty chafing dishes in about 2/3 of the locations. Barren trays of ice where seafood should have been. A carving station with cold end piece remnants containing areas of congealed fat.  Out of orange juice, unless you order a mimosa.  They amazingly had enough for those to keep coming. Scrambled eggs in a covered chafing dish that was full though. Since there was no plate in front of it, the serving utensils were left to superheat inside. No big loss, since the eggs were so overlooked by sitting in the heat that they were hard. 

My favorite dish was the bacon. The pan had 1\" of grease with about 10 crumbled pieces of bacon that ranged from .5\" to 2\" in length. Yummy!

We did get a discount of 20% because it sucked so badly though. 

Nice waitress, who was overwhelmed and crippled by poor staffing and overbooking.  She tried so hard to apologize for things that were  beyond her control. 

Tried to make the best of it. Good thing that Mother's Day will be here again next year. Maybe we will have better luck elsewhere."}
{"text":"I expected more. Piedmont is the 'Park Avenue' of Southpark dining - and yet it was 'good.' The atmosphere is over the top - feels like more than it it. The staff is not as 'seasoned' as other servers in 'fine establishments.' The food is good, good, not great. The bar has been overwhelmed both times I've been - understaffed or just poorly designed. It's nice for a change of pace but doesn't have the feel of a 'staple' for Southpark. It's a nice break from the norm but needs to raise the bar to match the prices and expectations."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my dinner at Georges Brasserie, as were the other five people at dinner that night.  When I first walked in I had high expectations!  The restaurant is gorgeous and hosts a classy, fun atmosphere.  The service was also wonderful--quick, courteous, and professional.  We were all getting excited about our food...until it was served.  Nothing was awful, but there much left to be desired.  I ordered a shrimp appetizer and snapper, but wasn't tempted to finish more than half of either course.  I was with a group who plays nice and shares, and I didn't feel my friends' meals were any better.  I did enjoy the creme brule, but not enough to redeem my meal.  My husband says he actually did enjoy his meal but felt it was slightly overpriced given the quality of food.  After dinner we took a quick poll and 6/6 agreed we wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed eating at your brasserie for years.
Today we tried you for brunch. Had the Oscar Benedict. Very disappointing. I specifically asked about the crab meat. First waiter said \"Oh, we deleted this(CRAB) from dinner menu. Let me check.\" He then  told me it was jumbo lump from Maryland. I thought OK, this will be good.
When it came it was back fin meat, no lumps and his reply was well,\" i told you it came from a can mad in USA\" If he had , I would never have ordered it. You should either get fresh crab or take off the brunch menu too. English muffin was not even toasted. Hollandaise was great! Yes, I am a foodie and very particular, That is why I asked.
Thanks for the read.
 Robin"}
{"text":"We ate here about a month ago and were excited about the meal, given the mostly good reviews. Unfortunately the food was a disappointment and we will not be back. The service was friendly but slow, despite there being few people present when we showed up for a 6pm reservation on a Sat evening. Onion soup was very good but it was all downhill from there. 
She had the bouillabaisse, which was made of good quality seafood but lacked flavor. I had the cassoulet, which actually had too much meat (duck, pork); it just wasn't very tasty and was very oily; I normally love meat but I actually felt nauseated after eating here. We had no desire to have dessert. Perhaps there are some better dishes but I don't think we'll be back for a second impression."}
{"text":"My fiance and I visited Georges last night to celebrate my birthday.  This was our first visit and I decided that french food was the way to go for my birthday celebration.  Boy, was I impressed.

Ambiance: We were seated in a cozy corner booth and had a great view of the entire restaurant.  The large white globe cafe lights add a nice touch, as does the hip music.  

Service: Our server did a great job considering he had 3 tables sit down at the same time.  He made wonderful recommendations on both wine and entrees.  

Food: Started with an order of fried calamari, served with spicy aioli- it was typical of most american restaurants, not bad, just not impressed.

The complimentary french bread and butter were perfect!

I ordered the specialty salad- mixed greens with candied pecans, pears, and fried brie. The salad was fairly large for a starter. I loved the flavors but would have preferred a smaller portion for a lower price (the salad was $12).

Entrees- I had the Trout Amandine, served with yukon potatoes and french green beans. The fish was cooked perfectly and the butter sauce was to die for.  Not to mention the potatoes melted in my mouth and the bean were perfectly crisp.

My fiance ordered the speciality steak- 8 ounce filet, stuffed with crabmeaet, served over mushroom risotto. OMG! The steak was HUGE, crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside.  But I must say, the risotto was even better. The mushrooms were in large chunks, which I liked because we could manuever around them if we didn't want to eat them. The sauce....oh the SAUCE! Folks, this is the good stuff.

We will be back...saving our $, but will be back, very soon :)"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR!!! 
Me and my bff always goes there for happy hour. This place never fails to make our hearts a little happier. We ordered truffle frites, mussels, and Brussels sprouts 2 martinis (4 total martinis for the both of us). Our bill came out to around $15/person. YOU CANT BEAT THAT. Their food portion is decent so it's perfect for sharing. 

P/s: The martinis are 1/2 off on Thursday if I remembered correctly."}
{"text":"I was down in Charlotte and found this restaurant on yelp. The atmosphere is very nice. The service at the bar was great. I had the mussels. They were very good. Warm bread was brought out with the mussels.  They have a great cocktail list as well. I will be back for a full meal so I can give a better rating on the food. Overall very nice restaurant with a sophisticated feel!"}
{"text":"This review is only based on 1 brunch experience.  

I have heard rave reviews of this place so I MIGHT consider trying it again.  With a party of 12 they force you to chose from a small, boring fixed price menu ($20).  There were 2 types of omelettes and a basic eggs benedict.  You can also choise beignets or a side salad.  

For $20 I would like more of a choice than a breakfast with 2 eggs and a small salad.
Second, I asked a server there about the menu and why it was that way.  She acted all douchy and said twice \"as your hostess about that.\"  Well, who the hell is the hostess?  They sent about 8 people by and no one introduced themselves.  

Service was good except for that BUT they gave themselves 20%!!! What?  First of all, I hate automatic tip taking but second, 20% is what i pay when i have good service and that should be left up to me...especially when you're charging $5 for an egg. 

I would have contacted this place directly through email but their site does not have an easily accessible email address. 

To me, this place is all hype.  I could name half a dozen better restaurants ...that are the same price or equivalent.  If you are in the area go to Upstream first."}
{"text":"I don't consider Charlotte to be an epicenter of culinary delights but this place is decent enough if you're looking for a brunch spot with quaint ambiance and delightful scenery.  Located in the Piedmont section inside a hybrid shopping area/apartment complex, this place offers outdoor seating and pleasant people-watching.  Our waiter, Adam, was quite attentive, possessed a witty, dry humor that I thoroughly enjoyed, and even offered us a table although we had shown up 15 minutes prior to opening time.  Note: the place opens at 11a on Sundays but liquor is served starting at 12p due to local law.  

We ordered a round of oysters to start but they were not served with the usual condiments I expect: horseradish, lemon, hot sauce.  We couldn't find the waiter in time so I just gobbled them down.

My main dish was a special of the day: sausage and steak in a skillet with poached eggs over polenta.  Edible but the steak and sausage were overcooked and I found the overall taste factor to be a 5/10.  Akin to what you can order at a NYC diner.  

My brother's girlfriend ordered a quiche with a bacon crust and THAT was scrumpdiddlyumptious.  Without the bacon crust, not sure the dish would have been as delicious.  Bacon does make everything taste better, doesn't it?

To round off my meal, I ordered the \"George's Bloody Mary.\"  Supposedly THE bloody mary of all bloody marys.  I never order this drink, ever.  I probably should not have let this be my first go at it.  It was served in a HUGE glass but something served in such a quantity should match its size in flavor.  I found it to be a bit watered down.  I did enjoy the two shrimp and pickled green beans served with it and, surprise (!), the horseradish I had been longing for with my oysters.

Overall, upscale diner-quality breakfast, with slightly higher upscale prices."}
{"text":"Great brunch. Classy venue. $12 bottomless mimosas on Sunday! The staff is amazing. You can't down the mimosa's fast enough before they refill... I kinda lost count :)"}
{"text":"I have been to George's three times and I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either.  I thought it was an over priced South Park restaurant. Today I went with one of my friends and we had a great lunch.

We shared a goat cheese/onion tart to start.  It had a strange consisitency, like pureed onion, but still had a good flavor.  Then we had a lamb sausage sandwich and I ordered the special fried flounder sandwich.  They did not pass my french fry barometer.  French fries not served piping hot just pisses me off now.  I know, I know, I know,,,, I know they would have been more than happy to bring me hot fries but, dang it, I want my fries hot without having to ask.

The best part of our visit today was our service.  Our waiter saw that we had cash on the table and he told us the gratuity was added because we used a coupon from restaurant.com.  He gets a gold star and he got double tipped anyway for being honest.

George's also has a raw bar and offers a happy hour menu that is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend, we were sat down with no water or menus. People walked by us and finally someone walking by got us water. After 5 mins I asked a bus boy for a menu, pretty sure the guy who brought us our menus after that was some sort of manager; no apologies. When the waiter showed up mins after that still no apologies for the wait. This place was not busy at all and everyone seemed to be talking around where you check in. I gave it a 1 star because we walked out and went to eat at Brio."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for brunch and it was amazing however on this particular day the service was the worst. No one helped us, yet all the tables around us were being served. I've asked two staff members who was suppose to serve us but no one knew. Very upsetting. Never had this problem before when I'm dressed to nines. Very funny how we have our card out on the table and we miraculously have a smiling server."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere . Wasn't busy, service a little slow, but server very nice. Food was plentiful and delicious . Would come back again."}
{"text":"Sadly, Charlotte does not have an overwhelming number of choices for French cusine so I had really high hopes for Georges. I was really hoping for an authentic French bistro experience versus a snobby over-priced pretentious restaurant. For my lunch visit, I found that Goerges Brasserie offered a nice upscale atmosphere with some basic traditional french offerings without being overly pretentious.   

My friend decided to go with quiche du jour - which on this particular day meant there was a choice of 4 quiches which came with a small side salad (around $10).  The quiche is enormous and wasn't overcooked (most quiches I have ordered around here tend to be overcooked and somewhat dry as a result.) 

I decided to try the ratatouille (about $10) which was served over pasta with gruyere. The veggies were cooked until they were nice and tender, but still had texture. The cheese was a little light but I could tell it was on the pasta.  Oh, and as Nicole and others have noted, their crusty bread and butter are outstanding!! 

I thought that the food was good, but not the best french cuisine I have ever eaten. (I only went to Paris one time, but I had some FABULOUS meals there.  In bigger cities in the US, I have found several French restaurants that made me think that I was back in Paris... this is not one of those restaurants.) 

Our poor server was having a rough time remembering all the specials when we first arrived and went over the menu, but she was very friendly and provided pretty good service overall. 

I am not sure if the food justifies the price points for some of their dishes at dinner, but if you can make it over to Georges for lunch, $10 for the entree I had was well worth it.  

Based on this experience, I would certainly go back to sample some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great; waitstaff was excellent; wine selection was on point. Almost all of the food we tried was too salty / had too many capers."}
{"text":"Excellent three course meal. Nice outdoor seating and great ambiance next to the Piedmont fountain.  The bread and wine were very French  I will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the brasserie on Saturday night based on ratings we found online and we were not disappointed.   The food was so good!!  My husband ordered the special (pan seared flounder with roasted red peppers and asparagus risotto with a crab meat sauce...yes...it is as good as it sounds!) and I ordered the mussels in white wine with French fries.  My food was delicious as well.  We had some bread with our meal which was also excellent.  We did not have much room for dessert but we still had to try one.  We took the chocolate mousse and once again, it was GOOD!  Our waitress was very nice and the decor was amazing.  I do not live in Charlotte so I am going to have to find some excuses to go back there soon."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte for business and was looking for something different.  Went to George's and had the Onion Soup and Scottish Salmon.  Both were very good.  Bartender was excellent as was the service.  It was an unseasonably warm January night and I had a beer out on a beautiful patio.  Very nice experience and evening."}
{"text":"We came here during restaurant week. It was our first visit to the restaurant and we were accompanied by friends who had been there before. Our reservations were for 5:45 and we were seated promptly. It was a corner 'booth' so a little dark and crowded. 

We were greeted by a friendly server who told us he would be helping us along with another server. She came by and poured water in our glasses, not introducing herself. For the remainder of the night it was clear that she was intent on getting us out of there. I am always mindful of when a server picks up the completed check from the table, which should not be done while the patrons are still at the table. This was not the case. In addition, we were asked for our credit cards BEFORE even receiving a copy of the bill. That did not sit well with me. 

When I asked for salad dressing on the side I was abruptly informed that no deviations could be made during restaurant week. I understood that, but her tone was condescending. 

The beef short rib was tender, flaked apart with a fork. Presentation of the food was nice. Creme brûlée was good, however I felt the portion was a little small. Also tasted the butternut squash soup which was good. Maybe due to restaurant week? 

All in all, the food not something I'd call outstanding. The service was below standard for a restaurant that claims to be fine dining."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. They had a set menu, 4 course meal. It was very good! I got crab soup, and filet minion, and Creme brûlée. My boyfriend got the cheese plate and lobster. It was very pricy but very worth it. The service was good too. I haven't had good service in awhile so this made us happy. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this meal wasn't perfect. I am giving them 5 stars because I know we are human and all make mistakes so I am judging them by how they handled my complaints. 
Our server Ryan S was the sweetest and most patient server. He listened to every issue and addressed it promptly and professionally. I worked as a server myself so I really do not like to complain but the following issues were ones I felt I needed to bring up.
1. French onion soup didn't have any bread in it which is like a big part of the soup. Ryan offered to get me another but I declined because I was fine just eating the soup and cheese.
2. They ran out of short rib but the manager(?) came and profusely apologized and offered a delicious filet in exchange. 
3. Rissotto was undercooked, possibly because they had accidentally given me mashed potatoes and they had to quickly exchange it. 
Now for the things I loved!
1. Amazing fresh warm bread
2. Pork belly and oysters were delicious
3. Ambience is perfect for a date night, I can't wait to enjoy the patio when it gets warmer. 
4. The tequila and thyme cocktail was phenomenal
5. Steak was perfectly cooked and such a good cut
6. Crime brûlée was perfectly toasted, not burnt like many places
7. And as I mentioned before, the service was great
Despite the bumps in the road, I had a great meal and I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Dying to get out of the house and looking for a special date night with my wife, we settled on going to Georges Brasserie. After looking over a few yelp reviews and knowing our deep love for muscles and fine wine, I figured this place would hit the spot. Georges Brasserie is a suave place tucked away in Piedmont Row that is serving up some serious French eats and great French wine.

Our reservations were for Saturday, so naturally the place was packed. We started by looking over the wine list and were delighted to see many options. While more familiar with Italian and California wines, we settled on a French Chianti and were delighted by the Sommelier who helped us make a great informed decision. Moving to the meal, we started with the fiery mussels and the escargot. Let me start by saying the serving of fiery mussels is enormous and amazingly delicious. Seriously though, we spent over half an hour sipping wine and mowing down muscles. Granted, I may have been slowed down by dipping several slices of bread into the sauce. Our waiter reminded us several times that they have bottomless muscles on Tuesdays, so I plan on making a return! The escargot was also as good as expected. After completing our appetizers, we realized we were stuffed and would end our meal on a high note.

I will say the overall experience that night was bittersweet. While I appreciated the decor and arrangement, the tables are spaced way to close to one another which caused issues for us during our dinner. For starters, my wife was hit / had her chair kicked by hurried staff on multiple occasions throughout the night. While I understand the place is busy, it detracted from our pricey dinner and date night out. In addition the overall space was very loud since everyone is on top of one another. I hope to head this off next time we visit by requesting specific tables that were more out of the way. In the end, the meal was amazing and I look forward to visiting this place again soon. Perhaps I can make it past the bucket of muscles next time and try some of their enticing dinner entrees!"}

It was our family's first visit to Georges.
The menu looked very good and we were all excited to treat my mother for her birthday.
Started with an OpenTable reservation a few days in advanced. Left a special request stating it was our first visit and we were celebrating my mothers birthday.

Sunday night 6:30pm
An hour a half after they open we arrive. No one was at the host stand and there were only 2 tables sat. It was very quiet and frankly quite unsettling. 
We made our way to the bar where we were greeted with a 10ft chalk stained mirror. You literally have to be blind to not see this. It was a total eyesore and immediately a topic of discussion. POOR MANAGEMENT!! 
This is a fairly pricy menu. The last thing I would like to see is a whole wall mirror looking like someone threw a glass of milk at it.

We then made our way to the table where they had failed to give us menus until we asked. REALLY?!?! Thats step one ANYWHERE!!!

Some guy then filled our water glasses and didn't say a damn word. He was clearly our waiter. My mother requested that her flowers be put aside for the dinner, so they wouldn't be a distraction. Our waiter scoffed and walked away.

Another waiter approaches the table and takes our drink orders. NO NAME! NO SPECIALS! NO NOTHING! COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF THE EVENING CELEBRATION.
If we wanted that, we would have went to Chilis.
After 20min with no drinks, no order taken, no communication, we decide to call it quits.
20MIN NO DRINKS!! It was Sunday and they had 2 other tables in the restaurant.
I called the maitre d over and expressed my anger and dissatisfaction of every aspect of our visit. He comped our drinks and we left to Del Friscos.

GEORGE'S HAS POTENTIAL AND A SOLID MENU. BUT DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE STRESS.
STEPS OF SERVICE START RIGHT WHEN THE GUEST WALKS THROUGH THE DOOR.
THE MANAGEMENT AND STAFF CLEARLY NEEDS TO BE WIPED CLEAN IF THEY WANT A CHANCE TO SURVIVE."}
{"text":"Found Georges Brasserie on Yelp. Great find!  The ambiance is chic. The food was beyond delicious. The background music is tasteful and nice to listen to. 

I had the French Onion Soup and the vegetarian crêpes. My wife had the She Crab Soup and Trout Almandine. Would highly recommend these choices. 

We plan to come back next time we're in Charlotte and want a romantic night out at a wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service and nice atmosphere. Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I dined at Georges Brasserie for the first and only time recently for brunch.  I read the menu online and it sounded good but in actuality it was just okay.  I ordered an omelet which spinach, sautéed spinach was used which had too much liquid that should have been drained better prior to use other than that it was okay.  I had prime rib well-done but there was some confusion about ordering it which was cleared up after 10-15 minutes.  When I received the prime rib, it was too fatty and I had to do a lot of cutting to get to the meat.  The meat was tender but needed more seasoning.

The buffet had desserts but they were not as good as I expected they would be such as the coconut macaroons and bread pudding.  The flavors were not well developed so the taste fell flat; I could not bring myself to touch another dessert.  The bacon was plentiful and good.  I love salad and had a Caesar salad that was drenched with dressing and the leaves were wilted and the croutons were awful.  Mussels and steam shrimp was offered, they would have been great with a little seasoning without it they were bland.  

In addition to the buffet, a few tapas (small) plates were available to order.  I ordered beignets and received three miniature ones served with a fruit compote which were okay.  The restaurants uses multiple servers per table.  Later, I ordered more beignets from a different served and was told as a small plate only one beignet is placed on the plate but how many do I want.  I looked at him for a moment and had to hold my tongue because clearly he does not understand the meaning of tapas.  I simply responded three beignets is fine.  When I received the order, it was worse than the first.  It was drained of color and oily.  I lost my appetite and asked for the check.

I liked that a terrace was available for outdoor seating which is where I sat and loved every moment of it.  The women's restroom was great, the stalls were spacious, the sink had motion detector so I did not have to touch a handle and plenty of soap and napkins were available.  It's a shame that the terrace and restroom were the highlight of dining at Georges Brasserie.  The $30.00 I paid for brunch was not worth the time, energy and gas it took to get there."}
{"text":"We dined at GB's last evening, for the first time and had an enjoyable experience. Wouldn't say a 4 or 5 star experience, as many reviewers have noted but to each their own. The service certainly deserves high marks, as it was truly 1st class. From start to finish, our server knew the perfect time to visit the table, knew the menu inside and out and kept the water and wine glasses full.

The wine list was also quite impressive, with predictably inflated prices but many quality choices. The food, from appetizer to entree's, were good but certainly not special. For instance, the She Crab Soup had an abundance of crab flavor but there was a minimum amount of crab. Our server warned me, in advance, that \" the lumps in your soup will be the larger pieces of the crustaceans\". Not in my bowl. Ordered the pork chop entree, a generous portion of juicy and tasty chop but covered in overly sweet BBQ sauce......certainly not special. My Bride's filet was a bit over cooked but remained juicy despite being ordered medium. Our request for Au Poivre sauce for her filet was graciously accommodated.

In typical French fashion, the tables are dreadfully close together except for the booths on the perimeter of the dining room. The glasses on our table were rattled more than once by the servers of other guests. If you looking for a fine meal, including some conversation, reserve a booth or prepare to adjust the volume up. We'll return again but only if we can reserve a booth and then maybe we'll have a similar experience as those 4/5's!"}
{"text":"Mussels! Do you know how I love them? Let me count the ways. The sauce alone, omg I could just order a barrel of bread and that sauce and be ok. Oysters are awesome too. This used to be the location of the oceaniare but it didn't do very well there. George's is a treat. Fine dining for sure. 

Atmosphere is perfect and the food is superb. Good date spot. Good place to take business clients. Good place to take Mom for a treat nice out. Good happy hour place. Cool bar. 

Valet parking and good parking in  the deck too."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere.  Attentive service.  Great for date night, special occasions or night with friends.  Decadent desserts.  We really enjoy Georges."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here and I figured it might as well be for Charlotte Restaurant Week. I decided on the She-crab Soup, Scottish Salmon, and Coconut Cheesecake. 

She-crab Soup:
This dish was seasoned very well. The giant crouton was pretty salty though, but was a great textural difference to the soup. You can taste the lump crab incorporated throughout the soup. Overall, a phenomenal dish. 

Scottish Salmon:
The salmon was cooked to perfection! I did not enjoy the giant dab of sour cream on top of my salmon skin. That made it a little soggy, but in general, I feel like it was unnecessary to the dish. The entire dish itself was salty. The puree was salty and the vegetables were salty. 

Coconut Cheesecake:
The cheesecake was light and fluffy and was a huge hunk. At this point in the meal, I was stuffed. The pineapple on top was salty and tangy, creating the perfect balance with the slightly sweet and creamy cheesecake. We had to take most of the desserts to-go. 

I want to give a shoutout to their service. The service here deserves 5 stars, everyone is so kind. I especially loved our waitress, Lindsay, she was so formal but also fun! She would speak French and kept up with our table very well by explaining the menu or just conversing with us. 

The decor is beautiful and the location is perfect for cozy date nights! I'm glad we came here for Queen's Feast!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal at Georges. Their charcuterie plate was divine. It included the country pate, which I could eat all the time. Just delicious.

The oysters were some of the best we've had in Charlotte, and the staff knew the differences, where they were harvested from, and tips on their flavor.

For dinner we had the boulliabaise and the cassoulet. Husband wanted to drink the boulliabaise, and the cassoulet was delicious, huge, but delicious. The leftovers made for an excellent lunch the next day!

Dessert was creme brulee, which was good but nothing original or spectacular. 

We will definitely be back to Georges."}
{"text":"I LOVE French-inspired Brasserie's - but this really was a let down, particularly in terms of service - and followed by lackluster interior design.

Stopped for a Happy Hour and was looking forward to some appetizers, but the indifferent bartender made me question why I'd want to stay, and the tepid greeting form the hostesses set the stage.  My buddy and I had 3 drinks each, but ordered no food.

The interior just fell flat design-wise.  Cheap, minimalist and uninspired.  Maybe I'm comparing the execution to Stephen Starr's Parc on Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square, and that might not be fair - because that is sort of the Gold Standard for the concept.  But, c'mon guys, warm this place up a little.  Give it some gravitas.  I want the owner's to look at Petite Chou in Indianapolis as a example of a great crowd-pleasing menu for breakfast/lunch/dinner/deserts with a rather minimalist interior/exterior (hint: not expensive - but damn, it works here and it could inspire Charlotte). I would not go back, not did I think it was worth visiting - except for a nice location."}
{"text":"I went to George's for the first time for Sunday Brunch with a group of four. We had 1:00 reservations but got there early, at noon. They told us to hang out for a few minutes and they'd try to get us seated. We grabbed a mimosa at the bar and checked out the brunch buffet. After about 20 minutes we were seated! We had a great brunch and decent service (we asked for 2 shrimp and grits and 1 benedict and they brought 1 shrimp and grits and 2 benedicts but no big deal). Will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a horrible New Year's Eve experience. Where to start. Dirty linen napkins, no plates for bread, inattentive waitress, cold drafts every time the door opened, one hour wait for the main course, rude manager. His explanation for the food delay was that he was serving 400 customers. What? 
On to the food. Lobster bisque too salty to eat. Oysters Rockefeller so over cooked  I couldn't tell if there were oysters involved. The piece of grouper was so small it was sad. 
There's so much more to this story, but I'll stop there. For $75 a person we expected oh so much more. 
We won't be back."}
{"text":"I was hoping to grab a late lunch but upon arrival I was informed that it was happy hour (3 pm). This was perfect for me!! I sat in the dining room by myself and ordered a glass of prosecco ($10) and two items from the happy hour menu...crispy Brussels leaves with a balsamic glaze and duck confit. It was great to be able to try these amazing dishes at a reduced price. I absolutely LOVED the crispy Brussels leaves!!!"}
{"text":"Scallops were fantastic and the mussels were awesome. Can't wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"Good service, nice selection of traditional french and American fusion options. The duck was tender and moist"}
{"text":"Best filet in town. This restaurant was amazing! Very knowledgeable wait staff. Great food! Very friendly!  Hidden gem. We will definetly go back!  Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Most extensive brunch buffet I've ever seen! Love the bottomless mimosa option, too!  Worth the price if you being your appetite.  You name it and it's on the buffet somewhere-breakfast foods, lunch, desserts, etc.  We went for Mother's Day brunch and it was very busy - highly recommend getting reservations so you don't have to wait!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and used my restaurant.com coupon:-) I had the potato soup with bacon and leeks...yum! The starter bread that they server is very good as well. I had the Beef Bourguignon over homemade pasta, which was good, but too salty for me, so I enjoyed my pear cocktail instead:-) I think I beat the lunch crowd, service was pretty fast as the restaurant was basically empty."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and the food was great! They have $5 martinis which is awesome and they also have seven appetizers for under $7 if you come during happy hour. The mussels were really basic but the pork belly lettuce wrap and the duck confit dip made up for it! The drinks were really strong and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Dinner for four during restaurant week went quite well. She crab soup was quite good as was the braised short rib entree.   Would have tried the beet salad but was not on the fixed menu.  Service was excellent.  Rock music in the background did not quite fit the decor or clientele."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the great weather today by dining outside for lunch. All of the elements in the Scottish Salmon complemented each other very well."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars but I just can't. The food was really good. The prime rib alone is worth the cost of the brunch. The salmon, salads, and breakfast foods were great. Definitely get the pomme frites.

The desserts were eh. Not really that good, but my boyfriend said the bread pudding was amazing. I don't like bread pudding so I can't speak to that. Neither of us cared for any of the other desserts. 

The reason I just can't give it 5 stars is because the service was not good. We were seated right away (with a reservation) but not waited on for several minutes. Then about 5-10 minutes later we got our drinks. You can order small plates that are included in the brunch but we didn't see our server for quite a while to order them. It just seemed like we were being ignored. Too bad for the server because we tip well for good service!"}
{"text":"It makes me so sad to write this review, but my husband and I were left irate last night at what was possibly the worst service ever.

Georges was 'our place'. Every date night for the the past 4 years, we'd look forward to their wonderful food and warm atmosphere. Our waitress last night went beyond inattentive and was completely rude. 

After being walked past several times with no updates on why the food was taking forever, or without asking if we'd like a new drink, we finally cut our meal short when appetizers took over an hour. We were starving and angry: not what you want on date night.

Seeming upset that we were suddenly leaving and without asking if there was anything she could do, she muttered a story about talking to the valet before leaving, because of \"drunk customers\" who leave their cars overnight and then \"call screaming\" that the valet has stolen the car. Excuse me? I just paid $68 for two appetizers, two cocktails and that completely awkward, unnecessary monologue? I have a babysitter to pay. Thanks lady.  

In all of my many, many visits (over 40, easily, with about 1 date night per month over 4 years) I've never seen the restaurant that empty on a Friday night. And it's easy to guess why."}
{"text":"My wife made us a reservation here on my birthday.  It was the nicest night so far in the year so we sat outside.  Also, it just seemed more lively outside.  Not in the loud sort of way...it was just more full.  The inside was still \"upscale\" feeling like it was when the place was Oceanaire.  But it was relaxed, I guess what a brasserie is supposed to be.

Like I mentioned, it was packed outside, so service was a little slow.  We didn't mind as we didn't have anywhere else to be.  We started with 2 apps; the heavily touted goat cheese and onion tart and an asian style tuna special.  I don't remember much about the tuna because...well it wasn't memorable.  I do remember the fish itself being really high quality.  The tart however was great.  Flavorful, airy, with just the right amount of crust.  Its one of those plates that you order every time you go.  My wife doesn't enjoy goat cheese, and she even really liked the tart.  The bread brought out was really good too.  We split the beet salad.  Looking back we should have ordered something else..she doesn't like beets, and I'm pretty particular about how I like mine.  So the salad wasn't for us, but might be good to you, appreciated reader.

For the entree I had the braised lamb.  When we go back I will have a really hard time ordering something else, it was that good.  The shank was textbook braised.  The meat almost had the consistency of good pulled pork, and when taking a bite with the sauce (red wine reduction maybe?) it reminded me of vinegar based bbq for sure.  I'm so happy our waiter talked me into this.  My annoying habit of asking \"whats your favorite thing on the menu\" really paid off this time.  My wife had the roasted chicken.  She enjoyed it but I thought it was a little dry from overcooking.  We were really stuffed so opted out of dessert, but they brought us some banana ice cream for my birthday.  I love banana flavored stuff so it was right up my alley, and the texture of the ice cream was perfect.  Now that I'm done with this review I've got a pretty good feeling that I'll order the lamb again next time I'm there.."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend for a friends bday. We had a party of about 12 and the service was so slow. They also got some of the orders confused as to who got what. The food was just ok and the portions are not that big. The one thing I did enjoy was the Mac and cheese. It was to die for. Overpriced.

Oh and I almost forgot that they ran out of makers mark and offered us another brand so we said \"ok\" not knowing that those drinks were almost double the cost of makers and they charged us for it!!!!!! Insane"}
{"text":"My girls and I celebrated my birthday at this lovely bistro last night.  I couldnt have asked for a more amazing time, not only was the ambiance inviting and bustling, the service was impeccable and the food was fantastic.  We called in a day in advance and the manager set up off-the-menu entrees for us, which came out in perfectly timed orchestration.   In all honesty, it was A LOT of food, but that doesnt mean we didnt appreciate it.  We went home with 3 bags full of leftovers!

He started us off with the fresh bread and butter, then came the cheese platter followed by the Shrimp Provecal and the Lump Crab Cake.  All three were shared and were unbelievable.  Then came the salads, which were huge, fresh and clean on the palate.  This was followed by a family style service of a shrimp platter (not on the menu) it had hints of fennel and citrusy notes which was sat on a mountain of Israeli couscous with figs and citron marmalade, very delicious.  Another family sized entree of beef medallions over rice pilaf and garlicky sugar snap peas and roasted peppers, as though all that wasnt enough, we had a gorgeous lobster to boot. I know, I know, us little piggies made room for dessert which was Creme Brulee and Lemon creme puffs.   I recommend the creme brulee to the entire world!  All this took place over 4 hours, lol.  I had the time of my life and the managers came out time-to-time to check up on us, chat with us and this made our dinner that much more special.  Even the chef came out to our table twice to make sure we were enjoying his unique creations.  Double chocolate brownie points for everyone we encountered at Georges, thanks a bunch for a wonderful night!  Oh yeah, imagine my surprise when he even offered to bring my car to the front because we parked on the 3rd floor in hellsville.  Gotta love it :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night with a friend and the restaurant was about half full. The hostess greeted us immediately and showed us to a table-one that was in between two other tables. This frustrated me a bit since half of the restaurant was full and my friend and I wanted to have a private, serious conversation. However, having been a hostess previously, I understand serving sections and why she may have sat us where she did. 

The service was fantastic though maybe a little too attentive. When you're in the middle of a conversation, you'd like to not be interrupted several times. I ordered a glass of Sancerre which really disappointed me. It was a good pour but it tasted like an old bottle. 

On to the food, the waiter was very helpful in making suggestions but I regret taking them. My friend and I had already chosen to start with salads--the beet and arugula for me and Caesar for her--both fantastic. There were plenty of gorgeous red and yellow beets in mine and it paired well with the peppery arugula and pistachios. The entrees were a bit expensive, so we decided to each get hor d'oeuvres and share. She decided on the crab cake and I chose the lamb sausage. BAD MISTAKE. The crab cake was burned on the outside from sauteing it and I've had way better crab cakes. The lamb sausage--disgusting. I've never eaten something with that weird of a taste before. I couldn't even eat it. Not only was the lamb sausage not spicy, it had the most revolting flavor. It was paired with couscous and figs. The server had so highly recommended it that we almost ordered 2 of those instead; I'm glad we at least got the crab cake. 

If you venture to George's, steer clear of those two hor d'oeuvres. The descriptions may tempt you but you're probably better off getting a salad and entree. I'd come here again to try something different and would like to try it during happy hour..."}
{"text":"Love brunch here.  Endless mimosas, hello!  Try the specials, quiche is always good at George's.  Also, cappuccino with rock candy sugar stirrer, cute!"}
{"text":"Both my husband and I have birthdays during Queen's Feast, giving us a good excuse to have a nice night out without breaking the bank. While we have some standard special occasion spots, we like to try 'new to us' places as well. For my birthday, I chose Georges Brasserie since I love the vibe, wine list, usual fare, and desserts one generally finds at brasseries.
We arrived a little early and the hostess (very nice and professional) said they were running 10-15 minutes late; that was just fine with us. We went to the bar to check out the wine list and raw bar. The oyster selection listed on the blackboard hadn't been updated, but the bartender was able to tell us what their daily selection was and my husband ordered 3 different varieties. He was very pleased with the freshness and the flavor, though the presentation was so-so. The bar itself is comfortable and just what I had hoped for. We waited a bit longer than we would have liked to be served, but once we got our drinks everything was fine. The hostess let us know our table was ready just as we settled up with the bartender.
I mentioned it was my birthday when I reserved and asked for a nice, quiet table . . . wish granted. Jeremiah was our waiter and was very pleasant and accommodating. I think because it was Queen's Feast meant a crazier atmosphere for him and that translated slightly to our service. My husband got the pork belly appetizer (fantastic) and I got the Caesar salad, (very good). My husband ordered the short rib (excellent) and I got the chicken with fig and sage, which I wasn't 100% sure about going in, but would highly recommend. It was difficult to pick just two desserts, but the milk & white chocolate mousse with chocolate ganache and the coconut cheesecake with pineapple chutney were good picks.
While the wine list is not extensive, it is fairly good. I had the Cloud Chaser rose at the bar and we shared a bottle of Sancerre during dinner - both good.
We'll be back when Queen's Feast is over."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for our anniversary, because of many glowing recommendations from friends. After being seated promptly, we waited about 10 minutes to be acknowledged by a server, and given water and menus. After this, the server was attentive enough. 

We started with the cheese tray, which was good and all, but was only 3 little slices of cheese. For $12 I expected a bit more quantity.

She had the NY strip au poivre (her favorite), and I had the flatiron steak. Hers was undercooked, and the brandy/cream sauce tasted more like turkey gravy than anything else. She's had this dish in Paris, and I've made it several times at home, and George's sauce wasn't even close. My flatiron steak was pretty good, but a little undercooked. The frites were nice and crunchy, but way too much salt. 

For the price, there are MUCH better restaurants in Charlotte. We won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"BEST MUSSELS I'VE HAD IN CHARLOTTE!  Hands down...AND they can be prepared in at least 6 or 7 ways (maybe more, not sure).  Wine selection is thorough and very pair-able with raw items or entrees.  I ordered the trout and it was delicious, but after splitting an order of the mussels and a salad with my husband as starters, it didn't compare!  Seriously folks, go for the mussels!  After dinner cappuccino reminded me of France... The atmosphere was lively and fun."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my parents and my boyfriend, and it was definitely one of the most memorable meals I have had in Charlotte.  I loved the atmosphere - very classy.  All of the food we got was delicious.  And most importantly,  our server was extremely patient with my dad, who can't speak english well but wanted to order two entrees instead of just one.  Much appreciated! 

For meals, I got the Butcher Cut with Bleu Cheese Mornay.  It was amazing.  I think what made the meal was the bleu cheese honestly.  It won me over from the first bite, and I don't even like blue cheese!  It was a little salty, but because it was on the side (I can't remember if it came like that or if I asked for it this way), I could adjust to my own tastes.  Still, the meat was tender and juicy at medium rare, and it was pre-cut. PRE-CUT.  

And I thought I had a two thumbs up meal until I tasted my boyfriends' dish - the NC Mountain Trout Amandine.  This was definitely what made the night memorable.  Even though I had just one bite, it was enough to make me want to go back for more.  It was so soft and didn't have a lot of the 'fishy' taste to it. It was like love on a plate.  If you have a chance to try this dish, DEFINITELY get it.  I'm not too big of a fish person, but this one totally had me hooked (Ha. Lame pun). 

My dad had the Pasta Forrestierre with a NY Strip cut on top of it (his special order that took 20 minutes to explain), and my mom had the Pan Seared Scallops.  I didn't try either but they both said they were delicious!  I'll take their word for it. 

Also, try the creme brulee for desert!  It's not too sweet but not lacking in that area either."}
{"text":"I've been to Georges a bunch and my favorite time to go is for brunch! I've had dinner here several times and it's usually hit or miss. Brunch is always a hit from the food, service and bottomless mimosas. For dinner, I've had their smoked pork chop, beef bougbugion (restaurant week 2014), clay pot lobster pappardelle, salmon with a pea sauce of some sort and vegetarian pasta (both during restaurant week 2017). The first salmon that came out was undercooked and the 2nd was perfect but it was time to go (ate at home later on). I would omit that pea puree next time, texture & taste was a no go. I will definitely be doing brunch again but I'm not so sure about dinner. Brunch alone is 5 stars!! Service is usually very good too."}
{"text":"Short review - After coming to George's many times since I've been in Charlotte, I FINALLY had their burger! Oh MY! OK so it's not cheap at $16....BUT it is worth EVERY PENNY!

Why? First they grind their own meat. Guessing chuck, brisket and sirloin? Just a guess....but it was super juicy and flavorful. You can get it however doneness you wish....But to me, it was their BUN which made this incredible! Had to be Brioche, and it was UBER soft and buttery. You've read my reviews which have panned places for having crappy buns or them being made out of depleted uranium! Not here folks!

Now the burger normally comes with blue cheese. Well, that's not my fave, so they gladly substituted Gruyere and I was a very happy camper!

Of course, NO visit to George's is ever complete without getting their crispy Brussels Sprout leaves with Balsamic Glaze....I claim that it is quite possibly THE BEST APPETIZER in Charlotte! No kidding. Brussels Sprouts??? YUPPER!

Always great atmosphere, service and of course the food is why I keep coming back to George's!"}
{"text":"Our recent meal at George's during restaurant week was absolutely amazing.  I had never been before, but now can't wait to go back during my next visit to Charlotte.

We were able to snag an early dinner reservation despite being restaurant week, and were seated right away after taking advantage of the free valet parking.  My parents and grandmother took advantage of the $1 oysters as a pre-appetizer.  

We all opted for the mixed green salad to being with which came with lardon (aka amazing bacon).  I couldn't resist the Chevre & Mushroom ravioli, and it was absolutely amazing.  As in top 5 or 10 dishes I've ever eaten amazing.  As in horrified when my mother asked the waitress to take away her unfinished plate of ravioli without offering me the rest.

Anyway, we all got the Pecan Bread Pudding for dessert that despite not being super warm, was delicious as well.  They had a special bottle of wine for ~$32 that my dad and I shared and was very good.

Service was excellent despite the restaurant being pretty busy by the time we were done with our meal.  George's will definitely top my list of go-to places the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"WoW!  Like stepping into a 1920's picture show... how have I lived in Charlotte for 5 years and only now been to Georges?  It's unfair!

I have been hearing about this place and their brunch over and over and over again... but just never really had the right time to go down to south park for brunch.  Then, one magical day, my fiance's family was coming into town (there would be 18 of us total) and they put me in charge of brunch - with one stipulation - that it was a cool Charlotte-y place.  Alright Georgey B, time to make Sydney look good!

And boy did he EVER!  This group was all over the place, some were vegetarians, some were picky, some were vegans... needless to say it was an intimidating crowd to plan for.  Georges brunch literally hit the mark with everyone.  First thing, if you're ever planning an event for that many people, brunch is really the way to go.  What I loved about Georges brunch is that it had a southern flair, but was still really fresh and incorporated a lot of seafood and veggies.  You could get the Benedict, hash, gravy, bacon... but you could also get a heirloom beet salad or roasted spring veggies.  Plus, DESSERT BAR + fresh beignets!  Bonus round.

The waitstaff was wonderful from booking to refills to checkout.  I seriously did not have a complaint in the world.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, had a lovely time.

Thank you GB!  See you soon!"}
{"text":"I work in Piedmont Town Center and have been to every other place there.  I finally went to Georges for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  Their special was a Quiche with Duck and Mushroom with a small side salad and lots of bread.  The service was top notch.  

My friend got the panini and he seemed very well pleased with it.  The prices are a bit high, but its an upscale place, so I can't fault them."}
{"text":"Their Sunday Brunch is an awesome spread of food with an omelet station and options from their menu that are also all you can eat."}
{"text":"We truly thought we were on a candid camera joke show. I've never written a bad Yelp review but just HAVE to for this place. 

The most BIZZARE and horrible dining experience my family has ever had. After 90 minutes of no appetizers, we realized only 1/3 of our order was placed to begin with. The \"manager\" told my mom and grandma their lobster pasta orders were out of stock then never brought them menus to reorder and played dumb 25 minutes later when we asked. We never saw our waiter after our drinks arrived. The only appetizer to hit the table was an order of 6 grilled oysters with 2 of the oyster shells coming EMPTY. They acted like we were a burden when we asked where our food was 2 hours later. 

When we decided to go across the street to Del Frisco's (Which was amazing) the \"manager\" said \"you should go there if you want to\" and told us to \"not penalize our server\" who we hadn't seen since 7:30PM when we sat. It was laughable and there are some serious issues going on there."}
{"text":"I would like to give these guys a higher rating, but we found this place on a gluten-free app. When we go there they had lots of gluten-free food options. But they did not have a single gluten-free beer or cider? Seems odd. The food was very good, but they need to complete the experience with some more drinking options."}
{"text":"I ate here on Christmas Eve and it was amazing! The service was great and the food was delicious.  It was very busy on Christmas Eve, however everything was done in a timely manner and the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch is a Gem

This place has been on my radar for some period but for some reason, always forgot about it till to late. We were in the wrong place at the wrong time or something else was interesting but just never got around to trying it.

I had booked a table at a restaurant in Kennesaw, GA last weekend on Open Table and they have been hitting me with suggestions several times this week.  On of the restaurants they kept suggesting was Georges Brasserie and since it was on my list anyway, we went ahead and made reservations for today.

After going today, I strongly recommend reservations.  We got there just before our 12:30 pm reservation time and were seated immediately. Others arriving without reservations ended up waiting for probably 30 minutes or so.

Not coming here before was a big mistake on my part. Sunday Brunch is fantastic and rivals my favorite at Epic Chophouse in Mooresville on Easter Sunday.

You're seated and your server comes shortly to explain the set up, bring water and take your beverage order.

The prime focus is the buffet but one the table is a list the call Small Plates to share which are made to order items such as Crepe Suzette, Eggs Benedict, Beignets etc which would not hold up well in a buffet environment.

Order their Coffee which is a Bold French Roast that is delicious. My wife ordered a Black Russian.

While these were coming, we hit the buffet.  First station is more a traditional buffet with scrambled eggs with and with out mushrooms, bacon, link sausages and  haricots verts (green beans)

Behind this and to the right is a station with raw oysters on the half shell, plump succulent shrimp and a variety of sauces including a spicy cocktail sauce and fresh horseradish.

To the left is a Prime Rib Carving Board with au jux and more fresh horseradish and next to it, what I presume was salmon. Looked good but did not try it.

Wide selection of breads and scones and muffins as well.

At the end, there is a large number of pastries available.

Everything was excellent. Oysters were great as was the Shrimp.  Main line was good although the link sausages were a bit dried out.

Prime rib was great. It was near the end of the particular cut of meat and they were bringing out a new one so I was a bit concerned it would be dried out.  Not the case at all. Very good and not dry in the least.

It's all you can eat for one price plus beverages so it's a good value. On top of that, they have complimentary valet parking which makes it nice.

Service is great. Our server was always there when we needed her but otherwise was unobtrusive and permitted us to dine in peace.

Decor is period French with a large number of painting and covers on the wall in a rich red and black interior.

First time here but will not be the last."}
{"text":"Brunch was excellent and I'm so glad we made a reservation through Open Table. We were seated in one of the back dining rooms which was perfect for our party of 8. 

The food was delicious and the brunch table menu allowed us and the kids in our party to share lots of entrees in between trips to the buffet. My only improvement or addition to the buffet would be to add a chicken dish for ppl that limit their red meat and pork intake and for those that don't care for fish.

Service was exceptional! We had an army of waiters clearing plates, filling glasses and bringing out dishes. Can't wait to come back for date night and try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is the best.  We always get treated so well at this place.  I'm a big fan of the appetizers and desserts but the main courses are just good. Things to eat: goat cheese croquette bibb salad, cheese platter (has homboldt and red dragon), cheese and carmelized onion tart, onion soup, creme brulee, and nutella cream puffs. :)"}
{"text":"My dinner companions RAVED about the seafood stew, so make sure to give it a try. I had the pork chop and it was fabulous--note that I substituted the polenta for some more Brussel Sprouts, and that was a good decision. The chef added Brussel Sprout skins, and they were life-changing! I came back the following week and had the duck and it was good too, just not too excited about the dumplings that came with it. The she-crab soup was fabulous, and so was the crab dip, though it tasted different the second time we were there.

Tip: leave room for dessert and get the Le Grande. It was delish! Thursdays are $5 martini nights...definitely worth checking out  

Delicious meals, and fantastic service! Amy served us both times and she was fabulous! She even remembered our drink and appetizer orders from the week before. A+ service from for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Georges during the week and sat at the bar this time.  We took advantage of the happy hour specials they offer M-F.  We tried the shrimp cocktail, tuna bites, French country pizza, calamari, truffle frites and the escargot.  All were good.  We also got the butter lettuce salad andmixed greens off the regular menu and I really enjoyed the mixed greens.  And then I also tried the fava bean and corn risotto but I didn't care for it at all.  As soon as you take a bite you are overwhelmed with some sort of lemon zest.  I wasn't expecting it and I didn't think it belonged.  My friend tried it and he too was like puzzled by it.  My friends had some other stuff I can't recall.  But they did send out a chocolate mousse for my firends birthday and it was soooo good.  It was creamy and light but rich at the same time.  Two thumbs up!!

Overall though another good experience.  The bartenders here are really great and I would not hesitate to sit at the bar and dine again."}
{"text":"Thoroughly pleased. I tried mussels, and oyster for the first time. They will continue to grow on me. Calm atmosphere & excellent service."}
{"text":"Great decor and awesome food but some dishes have very small portions 

Went to Georges on a Tuesday night and found it to be fairly empty. The decor is done tastefully and matches the type of food being served. The music played is not too loud and help to create the feel of actually being in a restaurant in France. 
I found the service to be fairly fast and friendly, and they did get all of the order right, so no complaint there. 

We ordered the mussels in white wine sauce which were outstanding and the Blackened tuna which was even better.

My only complaint would be the portion size on the tuna. The serving looked a bit lost on the plate and considering the price there should have been a bit more food. 

Overall I would recommend Georges as a great destination for a special night out."}
{"text":"We go specifically for the oysters, they always have great suggestions, but our faves are usually there east coast blue points or west coast Kumamotos - The tuna tarte we enjoyed so much we now try to make it at home as an appetizer on nights we can't make it out!  Don't forget Sunday Brunch and botomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"I ate there two days ago and I'm still stuffed. Georges is an incredible spot for French food. They have specials almost every night... from martini night to mussels night. We arrived on Saturday so there were not any specials for us, but they offered a roasted lamb shank entrée option that we couldn't say no to. We went with the mussels, oysters, and lobster gnocchi for appetizers and I was full before the entrée even came. The mussels came with fresh French bread, which was ideal for dipping into the delicious cream sauce the mussels were cooked in. They had great cocktails that reflected seasonal flavors. I would recommend the Berry Bramble or the Winter Punch (tasted like an alcoholic Shirley Temple). Service was amazing. Our waitress joked around with us, but was always professional and offered great service. We left full, with a large takeout box, and a bit intoxicated."}
{"text":"I intentionally chose this place for my \"birthday brunch\",  and based on googling \"Charlotte brunches\". It did not disappoint. It was well worth the value, and my husband asked how much it was, and stated, \"it doesn't matter, lol, but seems like it should be expensive\".. It wasn't. At $25.oo  person  and all you can eat, it was a bargain. Fresh oysters, shrimp, mussels, prime rib, as well as many made to order items such as shrimp and grits and eggs bendict, it was amazing. The mini creme brulees on the buffet were so good! Also, we ordered bottomless mimosas (12 dollars) ad bloody marys (14 dollar) and moved to the bar to watch the Panthers game after eating. The hostess and the waiter were extremely helpful as we moved and the bartender didn't seem to care that we were \"bottomless\" and provided the best of service!
All in all, I think it was a great value, atmosphere, quality and service for a brunch in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Love it! Sunday brunch and Tuesday Bottomless mussels are my favorite days to visit this amazing restaurant. The service is always on point. Our last server Mark was super nice and on top of things. Incredible food + amazing service= happiness."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, and it was not very busy at all, which was a plus. Menu is a bit limited, but I think there's something for everyone.To start, we had warm French bread and butter, both of which were superb. I had the NC mountain trout, which came with tender French green beans, small potato slices, and the most amazing sauce. It was perfect!

For dessert, I had panna cotta. It wasn't the greatest. Wish I had gone with the cheesecake special that day, the others in our group who got it liked it. The interior is very elegant, and the service excellent. I'm definitely a fan of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place messed up my husband birthday.  The manager was rude and the waitress was not knowledgeable. They FUCKED UP my vibe & I will never come back.  It's sad that the manager thinks cause ur \"BLACK\" that you can't afford it.  TRUE RACISM AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT.  if I couldn't afford it I wouldn't have made reservations.  It's sad that WE still have to experience this shit in 2016."}
{"text":"Had Dinner Tonight. 5 stars all the way around. From server Robert to Executive chef Joe to starters, entrees and dessert. Started with a Caesar and the pork/veal sausages with sauerkraut. Both delicious. Entrees were the pork chop and fried egg and short rib, Both done perfectly. Tender and great flavor. Finished off with a shared pumpkin creme brûlée. A fitting end to a wonderful and satisfying dinner experience. Kudos to our server Robert and chef Joe."}
{"text":"I have to update my review after the owner contacted me and offered a $25 gift card for our unfriendly experience there. Great customer service can't wait go back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambience, the lamb stew soup, the lentil burger is well seasoned and by far the best veggie burger I had, the mixed beat salad with touch of goad cheese was perfect portion and taste. 
Love this place. 
Chef, you should be proud of yourself !
Lindsay, provided amazing service, thank you"}
{"text":"Went there on a date night and wasn't disappointed! We've been looking for restaurants in Charlotte that remind us of the Northeast, and George's definitely fits the bill - stylish, casual, great menu and fun wine list. 

We sat outside, on the lovely patio that faces the common fountain (shared by Brio and Del Frisco's). The atmosphere really did feel a little bit Parisian, down to the small lights hanging from the awning to the wicker furniture. Really a lovely environment to have a french meal. 

We leveraged the house wine specials and had a carafe of the Sauvignon Blanc, excellent value and a good light white wine to start the evening. After a lot of debate, we settled on the green salad with dijon vinaigrette and the mussels in white wine. I've had a many renditions of this dish (including memorable versions in SF, Boston, and Spain). This was a very straightforward rendition, but the mussels were fresh and the broth was quite pleasant (and dippable). Salad had a bit too much dressing but was good otherwise. 

For our main meal I couldn't resist and order the steak frites (hanger steak with blue cheese butter). To me this dish is a true bistro test - if you can't cook a good piece of meat and make french fries, forget about making trout almondien or Beef Burgundy. The hanger steak was excellent, medium rare as ordered and clearly seared in a high heat environment. Fries were addictive (good sign) but over-salted. Oh yes, the blue cheese butter was as decedent as it sounds. My wife had the lobster ravioli special - 2 giant ravioli's made with 3 oz of lobster meat, served in a shrimp and tarragon sauce with a tomato coulit. Simply put, it was amazing - not a traditional bistro meal, but superb (and a great deal). 

For desert, we split the lemon tart - while the filling was very good and obviously fresh, the shell was slightly burned with really took away from the dish. 

Service was very well paced - some would say slow, but for those looking to enjoy their meal (and their company), it was just right. Our server was professional, gave us good suggestions, and wasn't obtrusive. 

Overall I'm really happy that this restaurant has opened and hope that folks visit often because we need more local places like this!"}
{"text":"I went to George's for drinks and appetizers with a friend, expecting to pay the South Park premium. Imagine my surprise when I saw apps in the $3-$4 range. 

For about $25, we had a martini and a beer, calamari, crudo (sea bass that day), shrimp cocktail, and tuna bites with wasabi. And the servings weren't tiny, either; we had enough to call it a meal.

Hoping to get back to George's for dinner this week. I'm eager to see if the entree menu yields a similarly satisfying visit."}
{"text":"We ate the buffet at Georges on Mother's Day, and it was a total disaster from the time we arrived to when we left -- rating as one of our worst restaurant experiences ever. A 1:45pm reservation was honored at 3:00pm. Either, the restaurant management got greedy and grossly over booked, or they are incompetent. Your choices were to wait outside in the heat or try to elbow for space at the bar. 
When we were finally seated, the hostess offered us complimentary drinks from the bar which we had to ask for three times. The hot food was cold and the salads were warm. Even if the food was served at the correct temperature, it was bland and lacked taste. The kitchen staff could not keep up with the crowd, and the serving areas were often sloppy. I have eaten better prepared food by a quick order cook at a diner."}
{"text":"My significant other and I chose Georges as the place to celebrate our first anniversary. It was a lovely experience.

The service was attentive and friendly, as is only appropriate for an upscale establishment.  We began with crusty French bread and champagne while we waited on our entrees, which arrived with amazing swiftness.  I ordered the sea bass on top of a seared polenta cake, and it was delicious.  The fish was perfectly cooked, with the skin crispy and wonderfully salty.  The polenta cake was browned to perfection, and the accompanying haricots verts were crisp and satisfying.  

For dessert, we shared a cheese platter.  We picked the chèvre and brie and told the waitress to pick her favorites for the other three selections.  The cheeses were served with tasty fruit compote and candied walnuts.  It made for a classy end to the evening.

We had a wonderful time at Georges.  It's too pricey to be an everyday excursion, but I highly recommend it for special occasions.  We will return as soon as we get an excuse to splurge."}
{"text":"Getthe oysters! Best oysters I've ever had. James River oysters I believe, YUMMMMM!! And the tempura carrots?! Never had anything like it. Delish. 10/10 would dine again!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here the service and food were excellent. Our waitress was a young and shirt brunette who provided excellent service. Ordered mussels and cassoulet, both were very good. Second time here is night and day, maybe I shouldn't have sat in the bar but the service is horrible. I've has to ask for bread with the mussels repeatedly and now have sat for over 20 minutes wanting to order something else to eat. I am going to be visiting Charlotte regularly and it's too bad this place is off my list.

Gave up on more food, leaving!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte for happy hour and brunch and dinner and drinks... and well... anytime!

Solid choices are the Firey mussels (ask for them extra firey and make sure to get plenty of bread to soak up the sauce!), crispy brussels, and the burger. The burger is really something special. I love the fried green tomato! They also have $1 oysters on Fridays.

They also have an incredibly brunch buffet on Sundays. The shrimp and grits is out of this world!

The bar side offers a more causal experience and the restaurant side is much fancier. Honestly, couldn't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Waiter was a little odd. Petite seafood plateau was big looking but not enough/filling. They ran out of bigniets & didn't have fresh bread for table and they charged us for toast for table. Hollondaise sauce was w truffles and best ever had. Ambiance was to die for... Reminded me of France. I will go back just for that!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for CLT Restaurant week! I've been wanting to come here for a while so I was like oh what the heck this is perfect! I ordered the cheese board, Scottish salmon, and the chocolate dessert (omg I forgot what it's called! :() Our server is SOO fun! Okay everyone there is awesome, But our server had such an upbeat attitude and made fun jokes here and there. I just love her awesome personality(: She started us off with bread & butter. Oh geezus their bread is so good- like REALLY good. I didn't really enjoy my cheeseboard much, it was alright. But the salmon was amazing! It was cooked perfectly. I felt like the sour cream was a bit over salted though. The desert was not too heavy on the sugar so I enjoyed that too! Overall I'm so happy we decided to come here, I give the food 4 stars but their service was so great I think it George's brassiere deserves 5 Lol!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to our visit to George's after reading many great reviews. Unfortunately, we didn't have the same experience.

Firstly, the waiter was pretty surly. He really had an attitude, and it was unsettling. That was a bit of a mood changer for us. We tried to start a conversation with him, but he wasn't having it. Okay.

Ordered the grilled octopus which looked delicious both in pics and when it arrived. It was so over salted that it was almost inedible. But we were hungry, so...

My husband ordered the onion soup. It looked fantastic when it arrived, all gooey and broiled. The soup itself didn't taste homemade. It tasted pre-made.. hard to say, but it lacked depth of flavor. Not the best we ever had.

I ordered the duck breast as an entree, which the waiter described as pan sautéed, crispy skinned and best served medium rare. Agreed. Sounded yummy.
It arrived in a cast iron pan with 2 huge dumplings and smothered in sauce that was thick, floury and tasteless. The duck was anything but crispy-skinned, and the meat was almost raw and tough. It took a lot of work just to cut through it. The dumplings...were just thick, heavy bready lumps. The dish wasn't edible. The waiter reluctantly suggested that I order something else, which I did. Normally, I wouldn't but this was that bad.

I changed my dish to the mussels, which, I have to say, were abundant, large and in a delicious sauce. The issue with them was that there were about a dozen of them that were unopened... either undercooked or bad.. but overall this dish was good. Maybe something was going on in the kitchen that night.

Would we go back? ... probably not. There are too many other restaurants in the area that we have enjoyed, that George's just doesn't make the cut. Not for these prices."}
{"text":"Service at this place is really good but the food is slightly above average. Our party had the Filet Oscar and the short ribs and the Filet was just OK, no flavor on the asparagus. Short ribs were better but certainly not close to other places I have tried. Beignets were OK. Overall just OK, not somewhere I will be clamoring to return."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 or 5 times for lunch, dinner and private events.  Every time the food, service and atmosphere have been excellent. 

I needed a receipt for an expense report for a business luncheon from 3 weeks before. i called over there and they faxed the receipt in a matter of minutes. 

They simply do a great job all around."}
{"text":"Excellent place to dine
Service outstanding Food excellent
Our waiter Ruben P who for some reason ever after
he told me his name I kept calling him Justin
Didn't correct me which was nice
Suggested a Great wine and knew  the menu very well and made very good suggestions which we liked
In a very professional manner three people in management came to our table to see how things were 
Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch because we had a gift card. Brunch is a buffet along with tapas you can also order. We had salad, salmon, prime rib, shellfish, bacon, eggs, hash browns - you name it! Also had some delicious desserts! Service was great and the atmosphere was nice too."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Charlotte for brunch hands down. Have I tried all brunch spots? Of course not, however I am so pleased with George's I'm not really pressed to try someplace new. Their brunch menu is large, delicious and reasonably priced. Each brunch also comes with small plate table items like shrimp and grits,beniegts and  pommes frittes . The brunch is served buffet style and is promptly attended by the restaurants staff and kept very clean . You can expect to enjoy smoked bacon, eggs, an omelet station , baked salmon, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and prime rib. There is a salad area with multiple salads, a seafood area with fresh shrimp and oysters. There is also a dessert table . It's so easy to get full here , so be ready. The waitstaff are top notch. You must visit this place for brunch."}
{"text":"First visit to George's and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We ordered the escargot, seafood stew and the duck. I wasn't a fan of the escargot but everything else was delicious. The stew was flavorful and the duck was cooked great. This is a great spot for a romantic dinner. Awesome service and staff."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch was awesome!  They have variety of selection you can choose from!  My personal favorite was the oysters, shrimp and the steak... Only thing I would recommend is to have more server on Sunday. Overall, I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Very solid 4 stars. Went here for lunch and have been back several times. I like the fact that they have the classics and some new twists too....all delicious. Soups, sandwiches and nice appetizers. Location is more in a commercial setting but inside decor is pleasant and staff have always been super."}
{"text":"Classy restaurant - have to dress up and look presentable. Luckily, I did just that - otherwise I would feel a little out of place. 

The food was delicious!! I stumbled upon this place because of restaurant week. I would not mind coming back here to try out other food on the menus.  It is pricy :( but the food makes up for it and on a special occasion kind of night. 

Service -
The one time I had dined, my waiter forgot little things here and there. But after many reminders, I got what I needed. 

Overall, I would come back here on a special occasion only.  I just hope I get a different waiter =X"}
{"text":"What made my date night special with my husband was the awesome service we got. The food alone makes the restaurant, but the service really completed the whole experience."}
{"text":"I can't get over the odd dish I had here.  I am giving it three stars only because our app was so good and my boyfriend's meal was amazing.  

We went here on a gorgeous night and it wasnt crowded at all.  We sat on the patio and ordered wine.  The tuna was fantastic as an app, coming with watercress and wasabi chips.  

My meal was so strange.  So I have been to France a few times and I am excited to see what old George pulls off with a fish out of water:  halibut.  Ummmm it was a nice size piece of fish, cooked well.  Served with chorizo sausage and potatoes in some sort of spicey sauce??!!!  Can you say WHAT?!?!?  None of it was bad but what kind of i-can-say-oui-so-i-must-be-french-stoner put this dish together???  It was ODD and not good to say the least.

Forgetting that - my boyfriend had the white bean and pork dish.  It was unreal.  I have been obsessing how I can make it ever since.  Pumpkin pie spices complemented the beans and pork.  So good I could hardly believe it!!  I probably wont be back to this place but will always remember his dish.  Yum."}
{"text":"Hosted a bridal shower here recently and the service provided to us was great. The servers were extremely attentive to everyone, the mimosas were kept coming and the food was plentiful. We had a special menu created for our party but I'm sure everything they offered is on their regular menu. I ordered the Broccoli Soup as the starter. The soup was chunky! Oh my God! Plentiful pieces of broccoli and at the right temperature. You could easily get full from the soup so I made sure to save some space for my entree which I ordered the French Toast. That too was really good. And parking is pretty simple. A short walk from the garage."}
{"text":"We were in there Saturday night and there were 2 bartenders and it took a good 4 minutes to get anyone to recognize us and come over. Oh, there were a total of 7 people in the entire bar area. I asked the female bartender what the count was on their shrimp and she told me 10-12 count. I ordered 3 they came out and they were 21-26 count shrimp. Just small and for $2 a piece not worth it at all. Didnt know how to serve my double espresso either. Just bad service."}
{"text":"Wow, didn't really expect to be blown away...Came here for a nice dinner with my family, we're a large bunch, and we were seated right away.  The waitress was really attentive and courteous, maybe because the restaurant just opened? The food was incredible! Portions and prices were right on and the seafood at their raw bar couldn't have been fresher.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes, even my uncle who is super picky.  The ambience is sophisticated but not stuffy and would be great for date night.  Oh yeah, and I got to see my childhood idol here, Ric Flair! WOOOOOOOOOOOO!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  The service was okay...

We were a party of three, celebrating 2 birthdays.  We ordered three appetizers:  petite plateau, onion/goat cheese tart and brats.  The raw plate was delicious and just as expected.  My friend thought the tart was to die for and the brats were good but sauerkraut okay.

We ordered two bouillabaisses and one mushroom pappardelle.  Delicious!  The seafood was perfectly cooked with a very generous portion.  I did not feel hungry or wanting more.  The creme brulee was eh with the sugar burnt and leaving a nasty aftertaste. 

Service was SLOW.  They were slow to get drink orders, slow to bring the check and just slow.  Our server was okay and seemed to be very attentive to the guests next to me.  Nothing particularly special for celebrating birthdays.  Just a candle to our creme brulee we paid for.  We had reservations but the restaurant was nowhere near full."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch is the best! Everything tasted incredible and there is something for everyone. Its also a nice way to try new things!"}
{"text":"Georges Brasserie is now officially my favorite brunch place in all of Charlotte!

The layout for Sunday Brunch will blow your mind. You'll find many of your favorites that you'll keep coming back for more (and more)! The shrimp are like ponies you can ride into the sunset!

Really impressive job of keeping up with the seasons - this past visit there was a wonderful Beet Tartare and Spring Vegetable Mix! Bravo Chef!

Don't even get me started on the dessert trays! Pure decadence!

Amazing first class service! Crisp white linens! Coffee, Mimosas and fresh Beignets to die for!!

The best of the best is the Crepe Suzette cooked to order! If I was trapped on a desert island, I would just want the island to be one big Crepe Suzette!"}
{"text":"I went to George's for the first time tonight with my girlfriend and had a great time. I loved the atmosphere/ambiance and the food was excellent! My waiter, Jeremiah, was extremely helpful and friendly and made  certain that my experience at George's was memorable."}
{"text":"The mustard mussels are AMAZING. The service is very attentive. I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The brunch was spectacular the service was wonderful. I will go back anytime. The brunch you can either do the buffet or order off the menu they have on the table. I am a brunch person this is one of the better ones I've been to check it out. They also have some some wonderful drink specials. And please don't forget the desserts."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch with some dear friends. I was so excited to try this place after checking out the mouth watering menu online. The food was absolutely outstanding which made the apathetic service all the more disappointing. If the food had been bad I would be sort of irate. Because the food was so incredibly good, all I feel is let down and sad because I don't feel like I can go back and waste money on the overall experience again. 

To start, we walked in and stood awkward and ignored in the empty lobby. A man in a suit, we assumed manager, approached the podium and asked if we'd been helped. We replied no. He replied that somebody would get to us soon and just walked away. 

We finally get seated and then...we just sit there. No waiter. No water. No menus. No instruction to go ahead and go to the buffet. Again awkward. 

Finally we just go to the buffet. A waiter stops my mother and asks where we are going. Well hey this is again awkward! She is embarrassed and tells him we are going to the buffet. He asks her for our drink order. She apologizes as she has no idea what the four other people in our party want to drink. 

Get back from the buffet. We now have water glasses but they are empty. Baby steps.  Hostess arrives in a bit and fills the water glasses. We are grateful. 

Food. Is. Amazing. I can't even properly describe how fantastic. So I forget about the fact that we don't have drinks and nobody has spoken three words to us. I'm in food heaven. It's the only non-awkward moment of the meal. It's glorious. 

Waiter appears and asks how we're doing. Umm, how about drinks? I order a diet coke. It takes several requests but it does arrive finally. The others have given up on this waiter and decide not to risk drink orders. Unusual for us as we love a mimosa! 

Waiter doesn't clear any dirty plates from the table until we are nearly finished. I'm not sure my mom loved sitting next to a stack of dirty plates for half her meal. 

Waiter shows up again. Does not clear plates but does ask if we want any a la carte menu items. We had no idea this was an option and he does not offer up a menu of items. Awkward, confused silence all around He suggest beignets. We accept this offer mainly to end the awkward silence. We have to remind him but they eventually show up. They are just ok. 

Time for checks. One friend says she will take the beignets on her check. He mentions that the a la carte menu items are included. We would loved to have known that prior to the meal. He goes to get the checks. A friend gets up and looks around until she finds the a la carte menu since we were never offered one. Wow, we would have loved to have sampled some of those items. Would have really loved to have been presented a menu when we sat down. 

All in all the food was more than worth the price. But the service was really, really awful. I promise you that we are also not those people who get snarky and sassy with bad service. We just sat there a little stunned and took it. Laughed it off even. But we won't be submitting ourselves to that again. Way too many other fabulous places to try!"}
{"text":"What a gem! Pulling up we found free valet parking, walking in to the restaurant gave you a European bistro feel, lanterns and lights strung outside. Our table outside was ready on arrival. The wait staff was prompt and personable. The wine list was sizable. Fresh and simple menu and great dessert! Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Excelent food, a great atmosphere, and even better service. I surprised my wife by taking her here due to us planning a trip to France and when we told our waitress Lindsey this, she gave us all kinds of advice and ideas on what to do. We will definitly be back!"}
{"text":"Food was awful & overpriced. The latter is usual for South Park. Samon was legitimately stale & hardened. Indoor ambiance is old/nonexistent. And the WIFI legitimately doesn't work. Oh, and the wait staff is clueless. So many better options right in Piedmont Circle."}
{"text":"Had a spontaneous dining night out with my girlfriend here the other day and also had a $25 off $50 coupon so I figured....why not?  I hadn't really heard anything about this place so I was an unbiased as I could be.  Sure it looked fancy, but I'll take good food over fancy any day.  

I had a pork and duck con-fit style dish combined with sausage, white beans and a bit of brown cinnamon to give it a sweet flavor.  It was really good!  I was surprised to say the least.  The tuna tar tar dish we got as an appetizer was a bit lack luster but manageable.  

Service was great, although the waiter came to the table with beads of sweat on his brow.  That's a no-no for me, I don't like to imagine a bead of sweat landing in my food, drink, etc. :(  Nasty.

With so many choices in Charlotte I don't know that I will be back but meh....maybe."}
{"text":"We went here on a very slow Sunday evening, we had made reservations but when we first walked in we were ignored by the staff hanging out at the bar for a good few minutes as they didn't seem to want to help us and there was no hostess in sight . When we were seated we were sat at an end small table, kind of away from people. Now to be clear we dress very well i believe I had a Michael Kors dress on that evening and we are fortunate enough to have the money to eat out at nice places but my fiancé is a body builder with a lot of tattoos and even though he dresses incredibly well we had a slight feeling of discrimination and did ask to move to a larger more comfortable, intimate booth.. Once we were seated our server was great.. He made great conversation with us and was very knowledgable with good recommendations . The food was good, my fiancé being a large guy had to order a second entree so portions are a little small (for him, keep in mind) I liked my food(i ordered the duck confeit) but I was not overly impressed. My fiancé loved the food but I was more impressed with the service from  our waiter we may go back again but not my personal number one pick."}
{"text":"Came here with friends during restaurant week.  We sat under the canopies on the patio, which was very pleasant and warded off all threats of rain.  Between the three of us, we tried all three of the RW selections -- trout, chicken and braised short rib.  The corn and fava bean risotto appetizer that I had was truly delicious and the mixed green salad looked beautiful.  The short rib was maybe a little stodgy, but that's short rib for you.  It was well-prepared and tender.  The highlight of the meal was actually a pot de creme with almonds that two of us tried for dessert instead of the more stereotypical chocolate mousse (also good).  Service was attentive but not overwhelming.  The regular menu looked interesting -- yet another place in town to get a big tasty pot of mussels, although it's going to be hard for them to surpass Lulu and Fran's on my \"favorite mussels\" list."}
{"text":"Ate at this place with my friend on my most recent business trip!  She has great taste and I saw that it was a James Beard nominee so I was very excited as I hadn't had French food in awhile.  The restaurant is split into a more casual section which we sat in to order off of the bar plates menu and then a more formal section.  We came during restaurant week and that menu looked amazing but more food than we wanted, same with the main plates.

  We started with mussels which were some of the best I've ever had.  We ordered the small and they were huge but they do have an all you can eat option and I see why because they are delicious!  After the mussels, we each ordered an additional small plate and they were huge!  My friend got the beef tartare which was seasoned well and delicious.  I got the croque sandwich.  The sandwich is a bit heavy but you are eating egg, cheese, and ham, so to be expected.  The frisée salad balanced both meals out and was a highlight with their house made vinaigrette.  I recommended this restaurant to my colleague who also travels to Charlotte and will be back next time!"}
{"text":"We revisited GB to take advantage of their Friday oyster special. The oysters were just OK, fresh but it took two to make up a taste. I also believe that restaurants need to present all the customary condiments rather than having to ask for this or that. We cruised with Steak Tartare, ceviche & lamb meatballs but stopped after that because we just lost interest. We felt that the Tartare was overloaded w/Worcestershire sauce & the lamb meatballs were merely a way to use leftover chops. The ceviche was thinly sliced scallops & mystery meat that lacked any spices. Sashimi fills that profile but ceviche needs character, a country if you will. Our waiter was great & did mention that a new menu had just been introduced. Me thinks he was referring to a new printing of the old rather than an actual change of items. Great views & great patio for cocktails."}
{"text":"THE Charlotte BRUNCH spot -- if you haven't been; you're totally missing out!  I have a lifelong love affair with brunch and buffets but when you sandwich them together; it's a match made in Sunday heaven.  I'm giving 4 stars for:  1. Great ambience; 2. Good service; 3. Good food; 4. Great value overall.  

1.) Great ambience. Georges is tucked away in Piedmont Center in very close proximity to South Park.  It's a French restaurant that has the most idyllic covered patio and is quaint chic inside with its red booths and white linen table cloths.  The buffet is set off to the side of the restaurant in the bar area featuring two hot food aisles, seafood, salad, prime rib, bread, and dessert stations.  You can also order beignets and 5-6 other kitchen made-to-order dishes from a small menu.  
** Room for improvement.  They place parchment paper over the white linen table cloths.  The two times that we've been, I've noticed that the table cloths were stained.  Ick.  

2.) Good service. The service is exactly on par with what you would expect; not stellar not awful.  Our first server was warm, attentive and super friendly. Our second server served us adequately but we did have to flag him down and ask for certain things twice.  So I'm averaging a great server with a mediocre one.  

3.) Good food.  Having been twice, the food is over all, solid.  Not spectacular but definitely delicious enough for me to want to come back regularly, especially on Sundays.  I've had: 

_________ Don't miss it!!
***  oysters.  They are fresh enough and definitely pass the digestive test (no tummy revolt after the meal).  They're on par with the house oysters at Sea Level or from Pearlz Oyster Bar.  The difference is that you can have as many as you want. 
***  peel and eat shrimp.  They are also fresh, succulent and good sized.  They are on par with Pearlz Oyster Bar but don't have the Old Bay seasoning.  
***  California salad.  The salad is fresh with goat cheese,  cranberries, nuts and a yummy vinaigrette.  Absolutely surprisingly delicious because buffet salads tend to be wilted. 
***  fresh fruit salad.  The fruit selection was a pleasant surprise.  The pineapple was juicy and sweet  the cantaloupe and honey dew on both occasions were absolutely fresh and superb.  A HUGE departure from buffet fruits.  I would say this is on par with the fruit quality of a St Regis buffet that you pay inordinately more for. 
***  sausage.  The sausage is smoked and infused with woody and a little sweet flavor.  
***  carrot cake.  Totally bummed that they switched out the divine carrot cake for pumpkin cake because the flavors weren't as decadent.  The cream cheese frosting is the same but the cake itself was disappointing with the switch to pumpkin (btw... I usually LOVE pumpkin anything). 

____________pretty good
***  beignets.  I thought they would be spectacular in the raspberry sauce but they were good, not amazing.  I would have liked them to be a little sweeter in flavor.  
***  eggs sunny side up.  There's a fancy French name for them and the cheese they put on it is great. 
***  prime rib.  They recently added au jous to the station, which helps with the dryness of the prime rib.  
***  mac and cheese. Very cheesy but would have liked a little crunchy component to it.  
***  bacon.  Who doesn't like bacon and how can you possibly go wrong?? 
***  creme brulee.  Solid.  It's a French restaurant,  they couldn't possibly get this wrong... 

____________it's there, you paid for it, so why not try it... 
***  French toast.  A little soggy for my taste. 
***  crepes from the made-to-order menu.  Being a French restaurant,  I had high hopes that just fell flat on flavor.  
***  eggs Benedict.  The hollandiase sauce was very bland. 
***  I tried almost all of the made-to-order dishes on the menu and none of them really struck a chord with me;  they all seemed to be lacking in flavor and complexity.  
***  desserts.  As with most buffet desserts, everything else was not memorable.  Good enough though.

4.) Great value.  I believe the brunch is $25/person, which is a great value based on the oysters and shrimp alone (there are also mussels that I didn't try that apparently they're known for).  Add in the made-to-order menu, the great salad and fruit, and a little bit of everything else in between, it's definitely worth it.  If you tried to go to Tupelo's (another Charlotte hot spot that eludes me), you wouldn't get the same value.  This is definitely a place that I am adding to my Charlotte regular dining rotation.

If you're a brunch lover like me and are seeking Charlotte's best kept secret, this is your go-to place, hands down."}
{"text":"Took the family here for brunch last Sunday.  I'll give you my honest opinion.   Brunches are hard to pull off sometimes and it shows here at GB's.  The menu looked enticing when we looked at the line up online.  I tried just about everything.  Here is my assessment of the food:

Oysters, Mussels, Shrimp Raw bar - Not too bad.  The shrimp was awesome.  Big juicy pieces that were cooked just right. The Oysters were hit or miss, they were a little tiny.  The mussels were delicious but too many shells were missing the meat!  They need to keep up with the cocktail sauce and lemons as they were running out quite a bit.

The Roast Beef was inedible. The RB was so rare I would almost have to call it raw.  There were no other choices as it was being sliced.  When one was finished, they left some scrappy pieces out on the cutting board before the next one came out.  Try cooking the roast to an internal temp of at least 120 and also provide some medium sections for others to choose from.

We ordered off the small plate menu.  The Beignets were hard and dense, not light and fluffy like one would expect.  Dad ordered the Eggs Benedict and when he cut in to them, the yolks were rock hard.  I can't take a hard yolk on an Eggs Benedict.  So much for those two items.

The Bacon and Omelet bar was great.  The bacon was cooked well and the omelet was exactly as I ordered.  The home fries, however, looked like something that came out of a bag and just got heated up in the oven.  Small cubes that were brown and tasteless.

The French Toast was fantastic.  It had a great flavor and a chocolate drizzle.  Very tasty.

The Macaroni and Cheese wasn't my favorite but I recognize that everyone has their own taste when it comes to M&C.  It just wasn't that great to me.  

The standard Bloody Mary's were ok but nothing special .  I would think they could liven their BMs up a bit instead of up-charging you double for what I would consider a decent BM.

The Creme Brulee was the best thing they had there.  The coffee was ok but kind of weak.

Overall the food was adequate but nothing that I would give rave reviews over.  I've had better brunch food and while the price is not as expensive as some other brunches I've been to, I still feel like the value just wasn't quite there. 

The service was decent, although I could tell our waiter was spread too thin.  Perhaps if they had some bus staff helping to clear plates and fill water, the wait staff could concentrate more on the guests.

It wasn't the Bruch that I had been looking forward to but it wasn't terrible either.  I hope to give them another try, perhaps for dinner one night."}
{"text":"Spent our anniversary here, definitely a great french restaurant feel.  Not an everyday place to go but perfect for special occasions.  Excellent food delivered with impeccable service."}
{"text":"Started with the beignets. Have eaten them at the cafe DuMonde in New Orleans-these were just as good! My husband had the quiche of the day-AWESOME! My daughter had the French toast from the kids menu-almost finished it. For her little 7 yr old stomach- THATS A COMPLIMENT!! I had the eggs Benedict-some of the BEST I've had!! We sat outside in the beautiful fall air. LOVED the atmosphere! But the most outstanding thing that made our visit here so wonderful was our awesome waiter PHIL LOERA.  He made our first time visit here out of this world. Based on our waiter, our food, and the awesome atmosphere, we will DEFINITELY be back!!!! Would drive the 3 hours it takes to get here for us!"}
{"text":"Not a fan - very expensive - food mostly cold - service terrible - been here twice and both times food fell short - not French - more American French - like Tex-Mex. Won't go again for the price it wasn't worth it"}
{"text":"Excellent Sunday brunch; great food and service.  I especially enjoyed the prime rib, salmon, and shrimp and grits.  The coffee is excellent; that's important for me."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of George's.  The fiery mussels and house bread are amazing.  Sometimes, I get that alone as my meal.  I'm also a big fan of the lobster gnocchi appetizer, the supple pan-seared scallops, served with sweet corn and saffron puree, fava beans, smoked tomato, and thyme beurre blanc and the NY Strip Au Poivre with brandy peppercorn sauce, served with a petite ceramic pot of truffle pommes frites. I've also heard great things about the goat cheese and caramelized onion tart, but I've yet to try it."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious and super tasty.  I had just landed in CLT from NYC.  My friend and I went in to talk business and to our suprise it was happy hour b/w 3-7pm.  They have a HH menu with $3, $5, & $7 items and on Thurs $5 martinis!!!  Absolute heaven :)  Everything was fresh, hot, well plated, and just simply awesome.  The decor is beautiful, welcoming and very relaxing.  More of a date and/or celebration place than business meeting but sitting at the bar was peaceful.  We ordered: 
Steak Tartar - coursely chopped, lightly seasoned, garnished with spring greens, very nice, big fan.
Country Pate - OMG amazing!  Homemade pork pate with nuts and other yummy ingredients. Garnished w/ pickled mustard seeds, cornichons and toasted baguettes.
Cheese plate - cant remember exact ones but there was a combo of soft, mild, and hard. Good size portions, and excellent! 
Brussel leaves - they were crispy and the balsamic vin added flavor. But way way too salty.  I love salt but chef got too happy on sprinkling sea salt everywhere.
Mussels in white sauce - holy moly, is this the best sauce ever or what?!  Bursting of full flavors and of course butter butter butter. Love it!  I asked for more bread just to keep dipping.  I would have ordered a 2nd dish if I was not so stuffed.  The portion is huge and well worth it, regular price or HH.
Martinis - perfect, delicious, cool and refreshing.  Nice heavy pour on the alcohol, Bravo!
Service was great.  Pretty attentive and definitely friendly. 
Total $45 with tip $60!  Best HH place Ive ever ever been to. Will definitely do dinner when I return.  Keep it up boys!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! Was highly recommended and they did not disappoint. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week on Tuesday night. It was my first time ever coming to George's and boy was this place impressive. Start to finish, this place was 6 Stars! The decor was elegant - the service was top notch - and there food was remarkable. 

I started the night with their \"spicy mule\" cocktail & it was fantastic. I later switched to wine: they have a good selection. I had the pork belly appetizer, and there's no need to get into detail on that lol....it's PORK BELLY! I then had the braised short rib and OMG it was phenomenal. The beef was unbelievably tender and if I had a spoon at the table, I probably wood have just spoon fed myself. ughhh...It hurts to even think about how amazing it was. Wrapped the night up with their crème brulee and a double espresso.

Of all the places I've been to in Charlotte, George's is definitely up there! I would recommend them to anyone and everyone looking for a good dining experience. I cant wait to come back again and try some other things that caught my eye on the menu...yea I see you, fiery mussels!"}
{"text":"Met up with old friends for dinner and conversation.  We first met in the bar and had a drink and few of the oysters on the half shell app special (on Friday's).  At dinner, the men had lamb (which was very good) and the women had salmon and ceviche which they liked as well.       Jessy our excellent server suggested the Stickybeak Cab 2012 which was a priced right, very drinkable wine.  Good choice.  Jessy also brought us a couple of deserts that finished off a nice evening.  We concluded that we should visit again to take advantage of their happy hour specials."}
{"text":"So a Sunday morning and I'm growing weary of the brunch places in town, so I decided to try something different.

Georges came to mind as I've heard folks talking about it for some time and a person I use to know liked the place.

I always sit at the bar to the left and down mimosas like it is my last meal.  Bar staff is cool and talkative.

Bruch is the only time I've been here, but always a fun time, though I have eaten on the patio one time."}
{"text":"Lot's of hype. Been their several times. I've been to some good French restaurants. Georges should be careful how they advertise their dishes, French? Food is delicious, the place is very nice. If you are looking for a PASTIS experience? Georges will disappoint and you'll be pissed off after you see the bill. Give it a try. I'll will give it a 3 star for being a trendy spot and for their outdoor seating. Great for your first dates. FREE VALET."}
{"text":"We had an amazing 45th wedding anniversary celebration dinner. Chris, the bartender,  & Natalie, our server, were amazing. We started out with the flash fried Brussels sprout leaves. They were great. Next I had the French onion soup. It was wonderful. I had the scallops and my husband had the bouellabaisse. This was an amazing celebration. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Mothers day disaster. Had a reservation, sat outside.  After 40 mins with no water or waiter, manager comes to apologize.  Ordered drinks, waited 15 mins for them. Table next to us sits down, gets water, bread and butter and cocktails as we wait.

Waiter comes and says \"Well, it's a holiday, we are busy \".  Ok. Ordered off the set menu WHICH WAS NOT DISCLOSED WOULD BE WHEN WE BOOKED!
In 10mins, main course arrives before appetizer,  AND they were totally rationing as we got a small bowl of seafood on pasta that did not go over the top of the small bowl. Our appetizer was a cheese course.  $48 for this was ridiculous 

We left but not before telling the manager why.  He apologized profusely, said he would call us by Tuesday to offer \"a redo\" on him. 
Never heard from him.

Be aware.  Full menu looked amazing but too good to be true.  Waiter who felt nothing to our situation and decided it was a holiday so we should just suck it up should be fired."}
{"text":"It's ashamed the food isn't better. French food is pretty easy to make if you have good quality ingredients and very affordable.  We dined on a slow night and even the service was poor. The waitress was not friendly rather rude to be honest.  Will not be returning as we gave it a second chance."}
{"text":"Went to try their Sunday brunch buffet. It was good, but it did not blow me out of the water. Everything tasted fine and fresh, but I feel like they could've had more options. Server was very helpful, but also super busy! Everyone one there was super accommodating, which I really appreciate since I baby a special needs daughter. Would I be back again? Yes! Hopefully by then they can get a little more food options."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an outstanding lunch here at a reasonable cost of 7 to 12 dollars per entree.  Onion and goat cheese app was superb. Lightly battered fish with the fish and chips and the squash and leek pasta were superb. A new favorite restaurant in charlotte."}
{"text":"If there were 10 stars to give, I would give 20!  This is by far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Not only is the food delicious but the service has NEVER been off and I have been there at least 30+ times over the past 3+ years. This is my go to place for birthday, special occasions and anytime by beau and I can't decide on where to go for dinner. 

Their mussels are the best deal in Charlotte! I love the fiery and most of the time I make a meal out of them.You want believe your eyes once you see the portion and all for $14. Other things to try are the crispy brussel sprouts (app), pork chop and bourguignon (amaz!). Really, anything on the menu is amazing as I have never had a bad meal. If you are open to trying new dishes and want to try a couple different things then go to their happy hour (also the best in Charlotte) $3, $5 and $7, cant beat it!  

I also love the ambiance, its like you are in France when you go their. The dark burgundys, heavy curtains and French romance music that plays. It automatically makes you fall in love with the place! Plus if you visit in the warmer months you can always enjoy the patio and enjoy the flowers and music of Piedmont Row.   

Finally, Georges has by far the nicest management team out of any restaurant I have ever been to! They go above and beyond to take care of their patrons, make ever dining experience rememberable and make every patron a regular."}
{"text":"french elegance of cuisine and the finest of service, straight from paris. i am honored to give georges my fourth and fifth star and look forward with great anticipation to my next visit to charlotte.

all that's missing is the you-will-get-to-know-your-neighbors closeness of tables to each other. i don't think it would go over well with american diners, but literally *everything* else was exactly and perfectly from an excellent parisian brasserie. thank you. thank you.

i needed this dinner tonight. it's been over a year since i have had the pleasure of traveling to my favorite city in the world, paris, france. owner george and chef  gave me a dinner experience i shall not soon forget.
--proudly facing the courtyard of this south park plaza, george's friendly and helpful valet took my car into their care.
--maitre'd graciously took my coat and our reservation confirmed, we glided to our table, excellently set and perfectly lit. 

an epic menu lists all my favorites. thankfully i have 3 of my best friends and colleagues with me for whom I can order and insist on tasting theirs... muahaha.

--sous vide short rib with sweet and sour cabbage and black garlic sauce.  epic rich taste whose sauce can only be mopped to the last squidge with the delectable and perfectly crispy crust of table bread.
--dozen oysters sampled from east and west coasts. best enjoyed with your perfect sapphire martini, horseradish and vinegared onions. oh yes, and don't forget the drop of tobasco and saltine cracker chaser.  mmmmm...
--saute of fois gras with cinnamon and maple breadstick. broiled leek and topped with fried quail egg. presented by chef himself, it was a masterpiece of flavor and what interesting choices. no, this wasn't on the menu, but chef graciously and proudly accepted my request and served a dish i shall not soon forget. magnifique, chef!!!
--ceasar salad was perfection in mix of lemon, egg and cheese, topped with a beautiful and oh-so-fresh anchovy. all i needed was to lightly brush that delectable and fresh slice of romaine over the fish to get the perfect flavor. the anchovy was the perfect set of last bites.

and now to the main course... what perfection in execution.
--cassoulet.  a very unique take on this classic wintery french seasonal. served as it should be in a cast iron dish, it is *so* hot, you can use the dish as your personal heater. the bean stew served with duck, sausage and beef is rich and flavorful. chef tops this version with delectable crispy cheesy flakey bits. could they be brreadcrumbs? i forgot to ask. what a wonderful and especially unique interpretation of this southern favorite.
--filet mignon with bernaise and haricots verts. oh my did i make the right choice for the green beans. perfectly cooked and rich yet light and letting the simplicity of the vegetable and its quality since through. the filet is delightfully peppery and dipped in the bright and sour bernaise, it was even more perfect with the wine (see below)
--coq au vin with spinach and aligot potatoes. plat du jour. *how* could i pass it up. i couldn't. it was delightfully moist and rich. what a special feast!
--angus ground beef burger on brioche bun with gruyere and carmelized onions. with frites. you burger lovers out there can have your prime meat ground and served casual style in this fabulous presentation.

topping the meal were the two very special bottles from the manager's private stash. the '96 chateau lynch bages was a special treat. in my own private stash are several of the best of the '96 bordeaux masterpieces for my 50th and 60th birthdays. the lynch bages did not disappoint.
the '07 heitz cab was listed, but somehow we got the '06 instead. lucky! lucky! lucky!

dessert featured our server's choice of fresh berries, balsamic, black pepper and mint, as is my tradition.  :)"}
{"text":"Excited for a great cocktail and dinner after the Wells Fargo Championship, George's disappointed on every level.   The bartenders rudeness was started off the evening.  The bar was empty and it was a chore for her to wait in us.  The appetizers were mediocre at best.  The worst part was be paid an extra high price to be served this poorly."}
{"text":"I go there almost every week for happy hour from 3-7. There appetizers are half price with $5 house wine. My favorite appetizer is white wine mussels."}
{"text":"My wife and I and some friends tried out Georges Brasserie several months ago during restaurant week. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience. 

The Slow Braised Short Rib was excellent. I also had a cold soup which had an interesting, refreshing taste to it. I also enjoyed the cocktails that I had. 

The dining room itself is nice and our server was pretty good. The place is a bit pricey so be prepared. Overall we enjoyed our dinner and I would definitely come back for a repeat."}
{"text":"We had reservations for George's Brasserie on New Year's Eve at 8:15pm.  We were seated promptly and offered a four-course prix fixe menu.  I started with a Ruby Bulleit cocktail, which contained Bulleit bourbon, Pama liqueur, fresh lemon juice, and cranberry.  It was absolutely delicious and the warm notes of the bourbon worked perfectly with the other aspects of the cocktail.

For my starter I got lamb lollipops.  They were small but perfectly cooked midrare, had a nice rosemary flavor, and a tangy dijon sauce.  I love gamey meats but the lamb was very mild, which wasn't a bad thing.

The salad course was a caprese salad that was standard for everyone on the menu.  This course was bad enough to knock an entire star off of this review.  The best parts were the thin ribbons of basil and the balsamic reduction drizzled over it.  The tomatoes were mealy and flavorless, and I am 99% sure the \"fresh\" mozzarella came from a Bel Gioso bag straight from the supermarket.  It was tough, very cold, and flavorless.  I think a more winter-appropriate salad would have made more sense, as this course simply didn't work.

My main was venison, cooked midrare as well, and came with braised purple kale and a slightly sweet grape confit.  This course really worked well.  The braised kale was slightly acidic which played beautifully with the grape confit.  The venison itself was amazingly tender, and again, there was no hint of gaminess to the meat which I missed a little but I understand that most people like a more mild flavor.  The cauliflower garlic puree it was served over was okay - the texture was silky smooth but it didn't have much flavor.

For dessert, I chose pistachio profiteroles.  I was disappointed that when they came out, they were filled with pistachio ice cream, rather than a pastry creme or something with a nicer texture.  The ice cream was all right, but it tasted like your typical storebought pistachio ice cream.  Nothing to write home about, and the pastry itself was unremarkable.

Overall, this was a good meal.  The caprese salad was terrible, but at least everyone else had to share in our misery during that course.  The service was so-so...our server never introduced himself to us so I don't even know what his name was, and he seemed to be in a bit of a sour mood as he dropped our plates off at our table with barely a word.  At least he kept our wine glasses topped up.  This restaurant seems to have lost a little bit of its luster, but I don't know if it's just because it was New Year's Eve and they were slammed, or if it is more indicative of an overall drop in quality.  We'll certainly be back to find out."}
{"text":"I love the classy feel and hip vibe at this French establishment.  This is my second time spending new years eve at this fine restaurant and it doesn't disappoint.

A+: Ambiance - I like the Parisian decor.  The waitstaff was phenomenal.  They were friendly and attentive to our every need.

B : Bisque - very creamy, the sweet salad added flavor to it

A: Spinach Salad - I've been eating pretty poorly, engorging myself in triglycerides so this was much needed and absolutely refreshing

X: Oyster shooter - so this is my 2nd attempt at the oysters and still not converting.  The friends gave it a thumbs up so I guess it's good :)

A++: Lamb Duo - my favorite dish of the night, flavorful and tender, I love all the rooted veggies to balance to the flavor

A: Salmon - crispy skin!

A: Ricotta - creamy with a burst of flavor, 2nd favorite dish of the night

The execution on each dish was well presented and majority of the dishes had a sweet glaze over it which is right up my alley so I enjoyed it very much.  This place looks suited for the perfect brunch so please check it out and let me know :)"}
{"text":"Georges is one of our favorite restaurants in Charlotte! Chef Drew always outdoes himself and the service is always superb...

Dont miss the tartar or the duck!"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and welcoming which is always a plus.

The bar area is expansive and well-decorated.  The dining room looked nice as well, but we sat at the bar.

We enjoyed our meals, but it wasn't mind-blowing.  Everything needed a bit more seasoning."}
{"text":"I'm from a large city in the Northeast,  where there are plenty of French restaurants.  On  a recent trip to CLT to visit my elderly mother, my girlfriend and I decided to take he here.  I had my doubts, but they were wiped away as soon as I got there.  The valet (always a HUGE help when you're with someone with a walker actually insisted on unfolding the walker--that alone led my girlfriend to say \"nice people!\" even before we had entered the place.  The maitre d put us at an easily accessible table, but which was prominently placed. That resounded for me; I am (unfortunately) accustomed to being shoved into a dark corner, when with my 80+ mother at young and trendy restaurants.

The homemade pate was properly silky smooth, and rounded out with a perfect touch of cognac.  My Chinese girlfriend promptly ordered a second round, eschewing the usual escargots at other French restaurants.   Service was, literally, perfect.  Attentive but not pushy.  Friendly but not cloying.  My mother commented \"what a nice boy.\"  That is Not like her!

I split a salad with my girlfriend, who was already happy from the pate.  She commented that the vinaigrette had many herbs, and was not overwhelmed by Dijon mustard.  She was right, as that's a common problem.

Mom had the steak au poivre.  I was terribly embarrassed when my mother spooned the brandy cream sauce into her mouth.  The waiter later said that's not uncommon-it's that good.  I had local trouth with perfectly cooked vegetables, light and flavorful.   Girlfriend had the mussels--so good, and perfectly cooked. Amazing broth.  Afterwards, the waiter brought out complimentary creme brulee. 

with wine, it wasn't cheap, but it was worth every penny.  And I tipped north of 25%.  we were treated THAT well.

Although we can dine at any number of French restaurants back at home, folks in Charlotte should appreciate what a gem they have here!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place in all of Charlotte. Brought family from out of town and they were blown away by the quality of the food and service. You must check out George's!"}
{"text":"Georges was so much more than I expected it to be. Went to dinner with a few work colleagues. I can tell you right now that trying to find a place to park in those garages on a Friday night is a bitch, so after a futile effort I gave in to their complimentary valet service, which I had no problems with. The attendents were pleasant and prompt.

DRINKS: I got there a bit before everyone else, checked my coat, and took advantage of the bar. The bartender was a little snooty and stared a good long time at my ID, but in the end put together a decent drink. The French Connection is quite exotic - the sweet, smooth taste of ports and wines going down, but that sting of scotch on your tongue. The smell was intoxicating. 
My favorite drink out of the two had to be the citrus basil martini. Strong while still being refreshing and elegant. 
At dinner, three of us decided to split number 303 under Interesting Whites, a Muscat. It had an interesting bite to it that wasn't too appetizing alone, but went amazingly with my snapper and the mussels. 

SERVICE: You just can't get it like you used to anymore.... except at this place. I can honestly say that this is the best service I've ever had. The waiter was attentive without being overbearing, made sure that all of our wines/waters/beers were filled, made great suggestions and pairings, and just overall attended to our every need with an expertise that you can't find too many places. Not to mention he was pretty sharp looking, which is always nice for the ladies of the table. Excluding the bartending experience, I would give service at this place 5 out of 5. 

ATMOSPHERE: Despite the points made about the decour in other reviews, I found the atmosphere pleasing. The dining room is large and high-ceilinged without being overbearing, and still providing an intimate atmosphere at dinner. The crowd, we did notice, was much older, however this wasn't any contention. Everyone there seemed to be there for an occasion - a small, intimate gathering for a birthday, or a husband and wife celebrating an anniversary. You got the feeling that to most of the crowd, this was someplace special to them.

FOOD: 
Apps: 
We all shared some steamed mussels and fuites. The fries weren't as hot as I'd like, but flavorful. The mussels were out of this world - they almost tasted coq au vin, and were so incredibly flavorful. My top pick of the evening.
The shrimp over risotto was also very pleasing.  I was delighted to see that the heads were still included on the shrimp (one of my favorite parts), and it was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The risotto was also perfectly cooked, creamy, and flavorful. I liked the addition of the red peppers. 
The fried brie salad was tangy and delicious, so no complaints there. I've had baked brie before, but never fried. It complimented the salad perfectly.

Entrees: 

The snapper over lobster basmati was delicious, and very much was complimented by the wine we had with dinner. The fish was, of course, cooked perfectly, and the rice was flavorful with just the right amount of lobster in it. What I really enjoyed was the sauce - it almost tasted like a buttery, light bechamel with chives, and I definitely want to try and replicate it at home.
The braised shortrib melted in your mouth, and was also cooked perfectly. The sauce complimented the meat and horseradish mashed potatoes very well, though it was said at my table that some thought there was too much horseradish. I personally thought it gave an excellent bite to the carmalized onions and sauce. 

Dessert: 
I can say that they create one of the best executed creme brulee's I've ever had. Pretty darn big, perfectly glossy on the top, and garnished with large, ripe raspberries, this melted on your tongue like nothing else.
I had the chocolate mousse, and it was how I like it - extra dark and delicious, however there was almost twice as much whipped cream as there was mousse, which left me a little disappointed.

Before I came here, I didn't think this would be a place that I would be terribly impressed with, as opposed to other places in Charlotte, but I stand corrected. I would definitely come back here. I pride myself on being a cheap date, but I can honestly say that the $80 bill that was said and done was on par with my experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to give Georges a try for Queen's Feast since we've heard good things. Our reservation was for 7:30 on Monday. We got there and saw that there were maybe 7 other tables seated. The menu looked awesome and the Queen's Feast options seemed like good bang for your buck.

The service started out great. Our server was personable and made some recommendations. I decided to order from the regular menu since I wasn't feeling the need to have three courses. I ordered the one rosemary and fig cocktail, escargot and the duck breast, and my boyfriend ordered the ruby bulleit cocktail, oysters, seafood stew, and the creme brûlée. 

Both of our cocktails were delicious, but I must say that the one rosemary and fig was outstanding. Very well balanced and not too sweet. Our hors d'oeuvres came out probably in about 10-15 minute after we ordered, but they brought me mussels instead of the escargot. The server was very apologetic, but we waited at least another 15 minutes for my escargot to come out. My boyfriend had 2 oysters that tasted dirty, and the escargot was lacking flavor. Not a lot of garlic and just under seasoned overall. 

We got our entrees after being there for over an hour. While I was enjoying the company, the restaurant only had maybe 7 other tables seated. During Queen's Feast I feel like they should be putting in extra effort to make a good impression, yet it was taking a noticeably long time for us to get our food after they already messed up my escargot order.

The food itself was good, not great. The duck was cooked well, but was over salted. The 2 huge scallion dumplings it came with were good, but they took up space in the skillet that would have been better filled with more Swiss chard and roasted carrots. My boyfriend's seafood stew was tasty. The sauce was good, but there were two pieces of each type of seafood, so the portion was a little underwhelming. I'm not sure if that was the normal portion or specific for the Queen's Feast menu.

We shared the creme brûlée for dessert. I have nothing to say about that other than that it was creme brûlée. 

Overall, we were pretty disappointed by the service given that they weren't that busy and that the whole point of Queen's Feast is to draw in patrons who they hope will return during the slow post-holiday months. The food was mostly good, but for a meal that was a special treat for us, I didn't feel that it was worth the price point. We probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite brunch spot and I haven't even taken advantage of the bottomless mimosas yet! 

So there is a thing that bothered me. There were no spots originally on OpenTable that worked for us so I called looking to make a reservation. The lady who answered the phone said there was no availability for the two of us and didn't offer an alternate time just that the bar was open seating. We were looking at other options when OpenTable suggested a now open slot. We rushed over and were promptly sat in the dining area where there were several tables that stayed empty the entire time we were there.

It's an all you can eat self serve brunch with some kitchen offerings. I will say we were disappointed with most of what we ordered from the kitchen (eggs shells in the benedict, chewy shrimp with the shrimp and grits). The pomm frites were moreish and the best of the kitchen dishes.

For the self serve area the prime rib is perfect (generous cuts and juicy), the chilled shrimp are already peeled. Oysters were good but they ran out more than once. Get the mac and cheese! It is oogy gooy cheesy goodness. There were cute little cuts of salmon and delicious tomato stewed asparagus. There were breakfast staples (sausage links, scrambled eggs and bacon) but none of them were impressive. So many pastries and desserts. We both left completely stuffed.

I believe the brunch was $26 which wasn't a bad deal considering all the pricy seafood options. Next time we will plan around having the bottomless mimosas (they bring the whole bottle to your table)."}
{"text":"Went to Georges last night with three of my amazing friends to celebrate a single-ladies valentines day. The atmosphere was really nice luxe fabrics, black and white vogue photography...a violinist playing numbers from the Sound of Music. 

Our server was an attractive young guy which we certainly didn't mind and he politely read some fantastic sounding specials and offered a couple recommendations.We were even personally escorted to the ladies room which was a nice touch!

 We each ordered a drink ( I ordered a citrus basil martini). Since I tend to talk with my hands I carelessly ended up spilling 1/2 of my delicious $10 martini all over the table..yikes. Well, no problem there as the bus boy scuttled over and quickly changed the table (paper) and I finished what was left of my drink. Someone mentioned something about my drink - at first I thought they said they would replace it, so I was a happy camper. Well after a few impatient minutes I just ordered another drink without looking up and I realized it was the bus boy not the waiter. He said he would talk to my server about it. My back was turned but my friends noticed that when the bus boy tried to talk to the server he literally stuck his hand in the poor guys face and rudely dismissed him. He was bringing me another drink which was nice but it certainly made our waiter seem like a jerk. 

After that service took a huge dip....

Complimentary bread & butter- heavenly. Great crusty bread with soft middle and creamy homemade butter. Wow, great start! 

We ordered two apps and a salad:

Butter Poached Lobster Gnocchi with black truffle fondue ($15)- It was bad. Where was the truffle? Why were the gnocchi WAY overcooked? Why was our lobster the consistency of rubber? It tasted terrible- almost had a distinct onion soup mix flavor. If I had ordered this as my meal I would have been deeply disappointed.

Goat Cheese and Caramelized Onion Tart ($8)- This was better but still not the best appetizer Ive ever had. I only tasted a little bit of goat cheese. 

Red & Yellow Beet Salad ($8) - My friend ordered this but I was able to taste it. This was great! Candied pistachios are my new best friends. 

For dinner two of my friends ordered potato gnocchi ($14) and one ordered the seared scallops ($27). I went with a special ($32)of filet medallions with Bearnaise sauce and crab meat- it also came with a side of lobster mac n cheese. 

I was lucky to try everyone's meal but I only enjoyed mine. The gnocchi was terribly overcooked and visibly unpleasing. They are lucky they served it to my friends because I would have taken it back. The scallops were large (yay a large scallop dish) but over-all the dish was way over salted.My steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The crab meat wasn't very plentiful but it tasted sweet and delicious. The lobster mac n cheese was actually pretty good as well. 

We sat around for a very  long time before our plates were cleared. The restaurant was not busy at this point. Eventually we had to ask for our server and our check. Oddly enough the other server and bus boy exchanged a laugh amongst themselves when we mentioned who our server was. I am not sure what that was about. Our server came over and slapped down dessert menus in front of us. We said we just wanted the check and he was able to split our apps for us which I was pleasantly surprised. 

2, 1/4 apps, a martini, meal, and tip  came to a little over $60 for myself. 

Although I liked my meal no one else liked theirs and service was pretty yicky toward the end. I wouldn't go back on my own accord. If I did go back I would stick to steak."}
{"text":"We went here for a friends' birthday.  George's has valet parking and takes reservations which is amazing especially for big groups!

It's all you can eat on Sundays for $25 and I had no idea.  Let me just say I wasn't prepared to eat plates and plates of food, but I did anyways because it was delicious. 

Normally for a buffet style food I would work out, not eat breakfast and be ready to eat a ton of food.  

There was about every breakfast thing imaginable on the Buffett.  I had oysters, shrimp, salad, Mac and cheese, and a lot of dessert.  

You can also order from a secret tapas menu as part of the buffet.  If I would have known this earlier I would have ordered more of these!  The shrimp and grits off of this menu were delicious along with the fries.  

They have $4 mimosas on Sundays which is an added bonus.  

I do wish there was a lunch menu that I could order from because I do not like to eat that much food normally and I have no self control at buffets.  The waiter said I could order from the tapas menu but it was as expensive as the buffet."}
{"text":"For my wife and I, Georges Brasserie is one of Charlotte's finest restaurants.

We visit often, but feel it isn't often enough!  We always request Joe as our server.  He takes excellent care of us and knows the wine menu and dinner menu and pairs everything perfectly for us.

We have had brunch here, raw bar, and a spread of dinner menu items.  Never have we been disappointed.  Our favorites include Steak Tartare, Asparagus and Smoked Salmon Salad, Roasted Dukk, and so many of their specials.

Want something romantic and a safe A+ experience, go to Georges."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great for brunch! Busy but not too busy. We definitely got our moneys worth on the $12 bottomless mimosas. Service was pretty slow on the drinks, our server seemed very frazzled. The buffet food was good, but not anything super impressive. I think that's always going to happen with buffet-style. 

It was a fun experience for brunch so I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food, service, and atmosphere!  Katie recommended this as her favorite, and I will have to agree.  Jeff took excellent care of us, and Georgio just happened to be in town and stopped by to say hello.  The scallops were perfectly prepared; the charcuterie (especially the duck) was very tasty; the pork chop was a double and very tender. ..I could go on.  My new Charlotte favorite!"}
{"text":"I disliked the fact that they automatically added gratuity. It greatly reduces my return to that restaurant, based on that fact.  There are so many amazing places to eat in the city that don't include gratuity.  Maybe it isn't the fact that it was added automatically, but that it wasn't pointed out, as if I would have left more based on not reading the bill.  Since, the waitress wasn't even very good, perhaps I wouldn't have left 20% - at one point the server was chewing/eating while at our table.

The food was good, but too bad the service was so-so; and I'm being generous."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight for my anniversary did not disappoint! Service was excellent thanks Ned!  The stars of the evening were the entrees the scollops were outstanding and a special for the evening halibut was equally great both were perfectly cooked! Dessert was as good chocolate cake deceivingly light and a creme brulee that was complementary for our anniversary. Coffee was just right. Five stars will be given if they improve their escargot my french food favorite which was just ok and had some shell in it and ive eaten many better ..the pate with an amazing fig mustard was really good but did not like the duck pate..will definately go back want to try their onion soup beet salad seafood starters so much more to explore.  Highly recommend giving this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"Always love this place but I only order the mussels. They do them so well. White wine version is my fav although I've tried most their flavors. Go on bottomless mussels night. You won't be disappointed. Their wine list is great as well."}
{"text":"My first time at Georges Brasserie was for Restaurant Week, so you already know it isn't going to be as great as it may be every other day out of the year. With that being said, my expectations were not met. Considering they have a limited menu for the week, it should be a lot easier for them to crank out the meals, yet our reservation took almost 4 hours! Getting anything was very difficult and we waited for a good 40 minutes just to pay. 

Now the food was very good but it wasn't great. I did appreciate that I was able to get oysters as an appetizer during restaurant week! I would be interested to give them another try but their prices are high so it might be awhile..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try George's Brasserie last night before our pre-Christmas celebration and were really blown away.
The food was excellent! We started off with a barbecue octopus appetizer special that was really flavorful and tender. Also, the complimentary baguette they give you is great - not a crusty baguette like I've had to endure many times at other restaurants. My girlfriend ordered the duck entree and I ordered the pork chop. Both were exceptional! Her duck was so tender and moist and was the best duck either of us had ever eaten (albeit both with limited experience). My pork was very good, and the polenta that came with is was awesome. Unfortunately we were stuffed even before dessert, but all the food we tried was very flavorful and cooked just right.
The service was pretty outstanding as well. Multiple different waiters checked on us or took plates, etc. but it was not because our main waiter was inattentive. The owner visited our table a few times as well, and the entire staff was friendly. The ambience is exactly what you would expect in South Park as well, very elegant and classy without trying too hard. No complaints about any portion of our visit to George's!"}
{"text":"You know, I've put off reviewing Georges for weeks - and until today I couldn't quite decide why. Well, here's why - I expected more. That's right, I expected more from Georges. And while my meal and experience wasn't a bad one, I was really hoping it was more than just ok. But for because of the latter half of the meal, I left feeling a bit \"meh.\" 

A while back hubs and I made it out to Georges for a casual meal on the patio. Before sitting down I took a peek inside and it's a similar layout compared to the previous tenant (Oceanaire). I can't speak too much to the bar or inside dining area, but they looked luxe. So, how about the meal? Here's the rundown:

Complimentary bread & butter: 5/5: Wowza. Crusty, delicious bread with real creamy butter. Delightful on all accounts. I had to hold myself back from theifing the bread basket. 

Goat cheese & onion tart: 4.5/5: By far the best part of the meal for me. Our server \"warned\" us that the tart comes out lukewarm, not hot, but to my delight it came out toasty. It was generous in size, full of flavor and delectable. I would go back just for this tart and request that it comes out toasty. 

Tuna Nicoise: 2/5: A deer would have loved this dish because it was a true salt lick. As in so salty I could barely get it down. The ogre heavy hand of seasoning ruined anything good that might have been going on with this dish. I barely had three bites. Could I have mentioned this to my server? Yeah, I could have but I only saw him twice during my meal before he dropped off the check. Thank goodness the water guys were paying attention to my glass because it was routinely emptied. 

Creme brulee: 2.5/5: The flavor was decent, but the consistency was not. The top of the brulee was, um, barely bruleed and the inside was not cooked quite enough. Sad brulee, sad Nicole.  

Will I come back to Georges? Sure, but I'll try completely different dishes, save the goat cheese onion tart."}
{"text":"Two words: Fiery Mussels.

I came here for happy hour yesterday evening. Wow, what a great crowd. I knew they must be doing something right when I saw how many people were there.

They have specials every night... but last night it was martini night. I hit for cycle on the martini menu. My personal fav was the Berry Martini.. and this is coming from a girl who lives and dies by a dirty martini. Yeah, the Berry was that tasty. The French was also great. Let's be honest, they were all pretty fantastic.

My friend and I got a variety of food. Fat kids, party of two. It was all amazing, but let's get back to those mussels. Peppers, onions and chorizo in a spicy sauce. I couldn't stop dunking pieces of bread in it. I may have went through a loaf. At one point, I was dipping fries in it. I would probably have taken shots of it if other people weren't around to judge me. 

I love oysters and they have a great variety here. So fresh and perfect with all the fixings. The butter poached lobster was another fav... served with potato gnocchi and black garlic beurre blanc. Little pillows of goodness.

We also had one of the steak dishes and the pan seared scallops. Both were cooked to perfection. The scallops had sweet corn puree, fava beans and smoky sauce. Great flavor combination.

The service was just tremendous. Our server Laura was on point. So friendly, professional and fantastic at her job. Every staff member and manager who came by were the same way.

Hats off to the chef and everyone here. I left full and happy. I can not wait to come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Meh, I expected more. We went for Sunday morning brunch (they'll tell you it's reservation-only, but there's actually a lot of \"first-come, first-serve\" seating by the bar). I had heard good things about their brunch but thought it wasn't anything outstanding.

I was impressed with the range of buffet options - from freshly sliced prime rib to a bakery bar to several pre-made salads. Unfortunately, the quality of the food was just not as high as anticipated. According to the fella, the meats were not very good, I thought the eggs were dry, and many of the other hot dishes were just standard.

The real highlight at Georges is with the baked goods. The biscuits, beignets, and other sweets were delicious. I'd definitely come back again for a pastry or dessert. Overall, I just didn't think the food was as good as the price and reputation suggests."}
{"text":"I've been to Georges on several occasions, for lunch, dinner, and weekend brunch. Each time has been a great experience all the way around.

Tastefully decorated without going overboard with all things French, Georges has become one of our go-to spots for a nice meal. The staff is polite and attentive, and are very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, and rarely will they steer you wrong.

For brunch or lunch, I love the croque madame. Hearty bread envelopes flavorful ham and Gruyere, topped with a light poached egg. It's a heavenly sandwich served with a side of their seasoned pommes frites (fries). For dinner, I always go for the trout amandine. Flakey, tender fish meets its match with the almond butter sauce and crispy haricot vertes (green beans). This has become my favorite dish at Georges (though, the ratatouille is good too).

You can't leave without dessert, and you should go with the cheese plate. Warm bread and 3 or 5 cheese selections, with candied dates and raisins. When it's not incredibly busy, some of the servers have asked me which cheeses I would like - if they have it, ask for the Red Dragon. Mustard seed and ale give this cheese a nice spicey bite. And don't forget a port or sherry!

Whether it's a date night, birthday, anniversary, or just a personal treat, Geroges Brasserie will not let you down."}
{"text":"The experience we had during Queens Week was overall very nice! The atmosphere is very beautiful and elegant! Our two bottles of wine were fabulous, however, our servers lack of their knowledge in particular blends was elementary for such a fancy place. The butternut squash soup was fabulous along with my chocolate moose, but the mahi mani was very dull. Not a bad pick for dinner, but also not a favorite."}
{"text":"Upon entry, we were greeted by the hostess who asked us if we wanted to wait for a table in the dining room or have a seat in what looks like an overflow/bar area. We didn't want to wait 20mins. so we sat ourselves in said area. I think making a reservation ahead of time is a good idea if you want to be seated in the dining area. Once seated it took awhile before the server came to greet us and took our drink order. Other than that the rest of the service was fine. Ordered: bottomless mussels (Tuesdays only), crab dip, and escargot. The mussels came three ways: white wine, coconut, or fiery. I tried the white wine but it wasn't for me. Second bucket I tried the fiery which was much better. Didn't try the coconut bc I'm not a fan of coconut. The crab dip . Can't comment on the escargot bc I didn't try it."}
{"text":"Have visited Georges twice over the past couple of months. Both times the service was excellent and the food lacking ever so slightly.

I had a mushroom pasta on my first visit.  Mushroom pasta was far too oily for my liking but as the cuisine is French, maybe I shouldn't judge the butter?  The rest of our group enjoyed their steaks and charcuterie.  I was quite happy with the wine recommendations and the cheese plate.  

Second visit - the ratatouille pasta was far less oily but lacked the amount of vegetables one would expect from a dish made entirely of such.  Mostly pasta..little veg.  The \"local tomato salad\" was stellar and I would return just for the burrata cheese - sublime.  Unfortunately my preferred wine was no longer being served but the wait staff came to the rescue with another pairing that worked equally as well.  

At each visit, our servers showed showed professionalism at its finest with their heightened knowledge of Georges' dishes and the ingredients involved.  We will return!"}
{"text":"Really a 3.8 

I have been to Georges about 4 times for dinner. It is a beautifully decorated restaurant and has an upscale French feel, though a bit more serious feeling than Cafe Monte's damask (love!). The outdoor patio is especially charming and has a French street feel to it. 

I must agree with so many others, the crusty bread and butter is excellent. They also have an extensive, fully stocked bar, so blue cheese stuffed olives in my dirty martini are no problem, nor is my pear vodka on the rocks. :) 

The goat cheese and caramelized onion tart, curry mussels, and beef bourguignon all tickle my fancy. The calamari was very good as well. I had higher expectations for the trout amandine, but it was fair. I have had the beet salad a few times and it usually fabulous, but last night's experience with it was sub-par. 

Consistency is key with fine dining. If George's can tweak it so that every night is an ON night, it will be, in the words of Mary Murphy, \" a force to be reckoned with.\""}
{"text":"If there is a best time to come here, it's for their weekend brunch!  Mimosas and a buffet that will feed you until you can't stand.  The buffet has a wide selection of breakfast foods, salads, fruit, pastries, desserts, and even oysters!"}
{"text":"Took my wife to brunch Sunday at Georges, where we also enjoyed our last Anniversary dinner at.  They just added a buffet brunch to go with their regular brunch menu. It's not a huge spread but what they have is high quality.

The buffet included: crispy applewood smoked bacon (cooked perfectly), French toast, hash browns, pork sausage, omelet bar, vegetables, already made salads, carved prime rib, peel-and-eat JUMBO shrimp, clams, pastries/deserts.

At no additional charge, the buffet also includes the ability to order anything off the limited normal Sunday Brunch menu and it was made to order and brought to our table: hot powder-sugar Beignets (with warm seedless raspberry coulis you can spread on to make your own awesome jelly donuts), Crepe Suzette, Shrimp & Grits, Croque-Monsieur, Eggs Florentine, Eggs Benedict, and freshly shucked oysters on the half-shell!

Our oysters were from an inlet on the coast of NC.  I can tell you they were the best oysters we've had in a really long time.  They were cold, delicate and had a slight citrusy flavor to them.  We were getting 6 at a time, and yes, reordered several times.

We dressed up nicely but folks wore everything from t-shirts (which we felt is underdressed) to suit and tie (which I wore and felt overdressed).

The entire buffet experience is just $25 per person including tax, but not including beverages, plus a really good tip since you do keep the waitress busy when you order menu items."}
{"text":"The resturant is decorated lovely.  The hostess and management were very nice and promt at getting me seated.  I  visited for the Sunday brunch, which per most reviews can be a hit or miss.  For my visit it was more leaning towards a miss.  The food was not the greatest either from the buffet bar or the ordered food.  The oysters, coming from a oyster lover who has eaten them just about everywhere in Charlotte-where gross ..like spit in napkin gag nasty.  They were large but had that unmistakable not so fresh fishy taste you dont get from really fresh oysters. Maybe I'm more sensitive to that taste than others because I eat really great ones often.   The creme brule was great! If you are in the area and haven't been there, not giving it a complete thumbs down because some seem to really like their food.  However as someone who has tried many of the Charlotte area brunches...there are better choices in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service impeccable.  I had the mushroom bisque, scallops and panna cotta for dessert. Need I write three more paragraphs? I think not."}
{"text":"This is a MUST DO for brunch.  I love this place and it's staff.  I discovered this place promptly after I moved above them. I have had the oysters (yum), Mussels (OMG), Frites....BRUNCH, and on and on and on.  All delicious.   Jeff is THE best manager and I think..no I am sure he has a lot to do with the success of this establishment.

Keep ups the great work!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times in the past, but I noticed that on my last visit in late September, the entree menu changed...and not for the better. We were both very disappointed with our main entrees, both of which did NOT come with any carbohydrates (no potatoes, rice, etc.)...just the meat/fish and veggies. The flavor was OK, but not great by any means. We've had better at half the price at other restaurants. The dessert was good, but not great. We had Creme Brûlée, which was fairly basic with just 2-3 tiny slices of Strawberry (whereas other restaurants serve it up w/ more Berries). The best part of our meal was the appetizer...Fried Calamari was excellent. I also liked the cool music they played, which greatly added to the beautiful ambiance. Another disappointment? I asked for a nice, \"central\" seating area (away from the bathroom and kitchen) in my reservations, but when we arrived, the hostess led us to the very back of the restaurant, stuck between several tables (terrible seating!), so that I had to insist on reseating us at a nicer booth table in the \"central\" area of the restaurant. This is always a pet peeve. I do not understand why hostesses think back of the restaurant (with minimal ambiance and/or in the \"banquet area\") is considered good seating. The waiter was nice and cordial, but the service was quite slow despite the small number of guests throughout the evening. I may return to try lunch or brunch, but I don't think I'll be coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, lovely service, but woah pricey! Felt like we were back in NYC. Our entrees were far too salty (and I like salt, so if I say something is too salty that is not good). Portion sizes too small for the price. The most impressive entree was my dad's skate wing special, but my soup/salad, mom's steak frites, and my husband's scallops all left us a bit disappointed. For me, Georges jumped from a Yelp 2 to a Yelp 3 based solely on the cheese platter (tres bien!) and the charcutrerie board, particularly the foie gras.  We have been eating foie gras regularly for decades and we've had some of the best that NYC, California, Chicago, and several parts of Western Europe and Canada have to offer. That being said, our most memorable foie gras experience was at Racine's in Montreal (sadly, no longer open) when we had raw foie gras which was literally the Nectar of the Gods. We have never experienced foie gras of that caliber before or since, until now. Georges gave us a tiny sliver of foie gras that was identical to what we had in Canada and I was just giddy over it. We will be back to Georges for the foie gras alone and next time will give their raw bar a go. I'm game for the $1 oyster Thursdays and am hoping that they are large and ultra fresh. A good oyster and foie gras joint close to home would be a slam dunk, even if we're not 100% in love w/ the entrees."}
{"text":"Janet and I finished our vacation with a not-to-be-forgotten dinner in Charlotte. One of the best Bloody Marys my wife ever had, great Chablis, plus sinfully good crab cakes started us off with the bar set high. Two delicious seafood entrees took us to a freshly made and then shared strawberry shortcake that was sooo rich, well I had to finish it after Janet threw in the towel. 

Great booth location with a view of the fountain and folks dining al fresco kept us visually involved until we left. The attention from the Brazilian owner and attentive staff was top drawer. For all the enjoyment and tastes we had the bill came in around $130....not bad at all! Money well spent."}
{"text":"When I first heard of Georges Brasserie, I had to google \"Brasserie,\" and was immediately more comfortable as it is French, but \"with a relaxed setting.\"  
Georges Brasserie certainly fits this description! The atmosphere is distinctly polished and French, complete with white linens. It is also incredibly warm and comfortable! (As is the service!!) 
The decor is fun and relaxed and the music exactly what you would expect to hear in a relaxed setting in France. Contemporary French and European style music adds to the fun atmosphere. 
I've been numerous times, primarily for Brunch, Lunch, and the occasional Happy Hour. 
You may have already heard about the stellar Sunday Brunch buffet or if you Google \"best brunch in Charlotte,\" you will find Georges listed. Simply said, it is definitely my favorite brunch spot! 
All the expected brunch items are there as well as an omelette station and carving station with Prime Rib & Roasted Salmon. There's oysters on the half shell and peel-and-eat shrimp. Salads galore and none of those cheap pasta salads! Lots of high quality fresh veggies. The beet tartare is my favorite! The pastries and deserts are phenomenal: crème brûlée, macarons, brownies, cookies, tartes, and so many more that I cannot recall. This is all just the beginning! Included is a small-plates menu (included in the buffet price!) with items that are made-to-order like crêpes Suzette, beignets and Eggs Benedict. Yum!! 
I also suggest checking them out for Lunch and Happy Hour. Their happy hour menu is phenomenal in pricing and flavors offered. Please try the crab dip, squash frites, petite mussels and the \"chips and dip\"... \"chips and dip\" is an understatement as the dip has duck confit, caramelized onion and delicious Mornay cheese for $5! What?! Thursdays they have a list of $5 Martinis, too! 
I appreciate having quality food in a great atmosphere. The fantastic service and super reasonable pricing usually results in me ordering multiple items and tipping above the standard 20%. 
Georges Brasserie was a nice surprise in South Park and has become one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has great atmosphere. The app was butternut squash soup which was not good in my opinion and was not warm also was kind of lukewarm. The Braised rib was delicious and tender and could not be prepared better. Wifey had the creme brûlée was sweet and melts in your mouth and vanilla and creamy stated dr Mitch. The chocolate moouse was rich and tasty.

The bison most tender and succinctly meat I ever tasted by dr rich.  Scallops were delicious and satisfied stated Lee.  Silky and smooth stated and cooked perfectly like fresh from the sea. Coming from lake city entrepreneurs carrots were like rock s but good tasting rocks if you rocks. Chicken  texture was nice and seasoned and heighten my salivary glands."}
{"text":"I could write a 5 page review on this place but I will attempt to be a bit more concise. :) 

The food: Superb. The pork chop dish was a last minute audible during dinner one night and is now one of my overall favorite meals, period. Mussels are incredible, go on a Tuesday to try them all for a great price and pick your favorite. Great great food! 

The staff: Could not be better. We had our wedding reception here (in the bar and lounge area) in August and were treated like royalty from start to finish. They struck a perfect balance of professionalism and approachability. From the event coordinators to the bar tenders to the severs and hostess everyone was so nice and made our wedding truly special-thank you!

The space: Gorgeous. Pictures don't do it justice. 

The bottom line: Go, eat, enjoy, you can thank me later"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a few weeks back while my girlfriends parents were in town. We had a big party for Sunday brunch. 

The atmosphere is excellent. They sat us at a nice big round table in the back of the restaurant and really gave us our space to chat and have a nice paced brunch. 

The food was excellent. Everything was really fresh and was prepared as we ordered. Their mimosas were on point as well. I think everyone in our party (10 people) were very satisfied with the food and service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was seated outside. Waited for 10+ minutes and not one waiter approached me. They were not even busy to justify it. I just got up and went to Del Frisco. Very disappointing. Heard great things about this place."}
{"text":"Yeap, I'm a fan. The first time I went to Georges Brasserie was for my birthday about four months after I came to Charlotte. I had already been to a couple of nice restaurants in center city but this place blew the competition out of the water with its great atmosphere and friendly service. Most importantly, yes, the food is great.

So for the price range I'd say it's the place to go for that romantic date, have a good time with friends, or even take your family/in-laws to have a good time. All worked for me."}
{"text":"Solid food, every time. Service is spot on, most of the time. Sunday brunch is a diverse tour different from the menu, not the cooler-clearing of other south Charlotte eateries. 

But, the person managing the front of the house needs to be very aware of what's going on. Brunch service is the easiest shift for servers in the whole week. Letting servers hang out and congregate, blocking guests path to the buffet- bad form. When servers forget to keep beverages filled, or drop the check before plates are cleared- you send the wrong message, and probably miss the chance to sell another mimosa. 

We will be back, don't get me wrong. And, we will be back for brunch- it's a fantastic treat, and a well-kept secret value for the South Charlottean"}
{"text":"We are here for restaurant week and it was great. The service was great and server was even willing to be honest when something was not her favorite on the menu. I got the pork belly appetizer was had great flavor. The short rib which I believe is not on the menu all the time was awesome. It was tender and was served over creamy grits. I normally do not eat grits and they were great. For dessert we tried the Creme brûlée and chocolate mousse. I thought the Creme brûlée was perfect, thick crunchy top and the custard was not extremely cold. Chocolate mousse was good but little heavy.

Overall we enjoyed and plan to go again."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch was fantastic.  Their Top Shelf Bloody Mary was the best complete with olives, picked string beans, and two jumbo shrimp.  

Service was very attentive, good crowd and lovely patio seating for a meal in the beautiful Charlotte Spring time, will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The reviews for this place are great, and maybe I would give it another try. We went for Mother's Day Brunch. The food was good, not amazing, but quite good. I don't expect amazing at a buffet, so I really can't complain about that. They certainly offer a good array and the servers worked hard to keep everything replenished and fresh. But, they were so swamped that service just fell apart. This affected food a bit -- the bread pudding was burned on top (truly black) because they were rushing to replenish and someone probably forgot. I will say that under the burned top, this was delicious bread pudding. We ordered just two small plates for the table and they arrived when we were nearly done with eating the buffet. They took forever because they were so busy and kind of forgot us or ran out of time. When we got the small dishes, they were pretty bad. The beignets were hard (like they had been sitting) and the grits (shrimp and grits) were hard and waaaaay undercooked. It was pretty clear no one tested them because no self respecting cook would allow that gravel out of his or her kitchen. The sauce and the shrimp were delicious. If the grits had been fully cooked, this would have been one of the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. The eggs Benedict (for my Mom) were cold and had no Hollandaise. Cold poached eggs - ew. Again, I think it would be fine on a normal Sunday. The bartender apologized for my drink while we were waiting at the bar and told me he is a server and not actually a bartender. I had ordered an Aperol spritz and it was not really right and served in the wrong kind of glass, but I drank at and honestly felt bad for the young man. But the biggest problem of all was the wait. We had 1:15 reservations. We arrived at 1:10. We waited in line for a good 10 minutes just to check in. We were not seated until 2:15. You read that right -- we were seated a full hour after our reservation. This was Mother's Day and we had an elderly woman with us (84). We had to remind the desk that we were waiting for a long time. The staff was doing their best, but who the heck allowed so much overbooking? They said the hot day was to blame because people did not want to sit outside. It is NC -- it gets hot. They should have planned for that. Anyway, as much as I think I would like the food if I went back, I doubt we will go back. There are just too many other options to risk it. The staff did what they could but it kind of ruined Mother's Day, especially for my Mom who was tired after standing for so long in a jostling crowd (we were dodging the folks trying to get their buffet items while we were waiting). It was a logistical disaster."}
{"text":"Phil is our favorite waiter and what makes George's our favorite place. He makes the experience phenomenal with his fantastic service: whether it be outside sitting outside for brunch OR a fine dining experience. We love this restaurant because the food is wonderful but the staff makes it top notch. Thank you, Phil for another wonderful meal. We will back soon."}
{"text":"This place has a very good raw bar. Plenty of other choices as well on the menu to satisfy just about everyone.  It is a little pricey, however, it is to be expected in this part of town."}
{"text":"It's kind of amazing when something that has 100% potential to be pretentious buffoonery overcomes the odds and makes what might have been a boring old lunch into something special.

Do you like being fawned over? Mornay sauce? Two napkins and lots of large, heavy silverware? Expensive bottles of wine, names printed in script so that they're hard to read? You'll like it here.

Oddly, you'll also like it here if you like butter, really good bread, Veg-friendly Frenchish food and comfy chairs, and good deals. Because at 10 bucks for a sizable, rich entree complete with frites, a beverage, and a salad, it's one of the best lunchie deals in the area. The Ratatouille was standard but sat atop this incredible, creamy pillow of polenta. Hell yes. And the Croque, minus ham + tomato, was killer.

Friend had mussels and wrastled with them a bit, but enjoyed. 

Why, oh why, were the fries so cold and soggy? Close, George, but no cigar."}
{"text":"I have been to Georges about 5 times over the past couple of years. It has always been a memorable experience. But, I have to concur with the other posts about poor service in Mothers Day and the food was mediocre. All in all, we couldn't wait to leave. We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, ambience.  A joy.  Some people in the restaurant business still know what they're doing. Bravo.  What else can I say?"}
{"text":"Really a 3.5

Checked this place out on a Saturday evening with a friend for dinner. We were seated immediately, as I made reservations earlier in the day and the hostess was nice. I ordered the Brumbleberry cocktail. It was strong, so be prepared. Basically a shot of bourbon with some mashed berries. Too much ice.... annoying. For $12..... since this is a higher end establishment, I guess it's to be expected. 

I ordered the Scottish salmon. It was really good, but not impressive. The portion was just enough that you would no longer be hungry, but you wouldn't leave stuffed. That being said, the lentils were tasty and I wish they would've had twice as many. The presentation was nice.

My friend had the pork chop, which she said was fantastic. Because she has false teeth -childhood accident-, she couldn't eat around the bone (the best part :-) ) So I had a taste of the pork chop and it was great. The side of mac and cheese had some sort of meat in it.

Why only 3.5 stars? Nothing was special. This is a consistently good restaurant, but I expected more because I heard such great things. Yet there wasn't anything that has me itching to come back soon. They appear to have an interesting happy hour menu that's worth checking out."}
{"text":"How does one rate a place that serves tasty food that sadly makes them deathly ill the next morning? 

Well, let's begin with the facts. I came to this establishment with three guests. 

The decor was nice. The atmosphere was quiet. I believe we were one of two tables being served on this particular night. 

My party and I all tried a shrimp dish, which was one of their specials. The flavor was good.

Service was slow, especially since it was a fairly slow night. 

The next morning, all of my friends were sick, as was I. Coincidence? Perhaps. 
Or it could have been the shrimp.

It will take me a while to gain the courage to give George's a second try. Right now, I can't even think about it without feeling nauseous. 

Luckily, it seems like this was perhaps a fluke, for some of my other friends have had good experiences here. No restaurant is perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent Brunch...maybe the best brunch buffet in Charlotte!  From the French toast to shrimp and grits, every option I tasted on the menu was amazingly prepared by the chef.  The salad selection was great...not your usual lettuce & tomato, but instead included best salad as well as farm fresh diced veggies salad.  The shrimp, Oysters, salmon, & prime rib were in abundance.  You also have an omelet station, various bread selection, and unbelievable desert display (macaroons, mini creme brûlée, bread pudding to mention a few).  Definitely a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Brunch on Mother's Day with my wife and baby. Excellent service, waiter was attentive and very polite.  The buffet was so good!!! Seafood, fruit, pastries, breakfast items, roast cutting station, etc. My wife and I still talk about how good everything tasted and even my one year old ate everything we gave him! Cost per person is pretty steep but in my opinion it was definitely worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week and wasn't overly impressed. The service was very good, I will say that. I did like the oysters Rockefeller, but my main dish of mahi mahi was bland. There just wasn't much to it. I had higher hopes for this place, and I was a little let down."}
{"text":"Georges is one of those places your going to take you significant other or an important business client to dinner.

I had the Cassoulet. Pork and duck confit pieces.

This is fine dining at its best and probably a great place to impress your date."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The waiter was busy 
And was more interested in a two top that were 
Parents of a co worker. I think maybe going later and 
Not on a Friday night the service would be better.

I had the beat salad which was wonderful. And I can't remember 
What my entree was? I would go again."}
{"text":"Delightful..was delicious food & great service..we thank you for helping to make our valentine day one to remember"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, superb service on our first visit. Charming, inviting atmosphere. The waiter overheard us talking about coq au vin, and, although it wasn't on the menu that night, he spoke with the chef and they offered to prepare it for us, since they had the sauce leftover from a private party the night before. It was the perfect meal for a rainy evening, and we just really appreciated the waiter's attentiveness and thoughtfulness. The perfect service made it such an enjoyable evening. And, one person in our party had a coupon, and they were very gracious about accepting it --  no pretension there. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I finally committed to making the drive down here from our North side of town for my birthday.  I really enjoyed the town center it was in.  It set the tone, a classy atmosphere.  

The fried calamari here was fantastic.  It was well seasoned and cooked just right.  Really, the aoli sauce is what made the plate.  It had the perfect combination of flavor and spice.  

We followed up with Caesar salads.  The taste was pretty spot on, but the presentation was a bit much.  The crouton (one long one) was tough to break apart and the romaine was left long cut.  Maybe that's an authentic type thing?  I dont know, but I'll be the first to admit I'm not the most culturally knowledgeable person out there.  Either way, I prefer to eat my salad without having to use a knife.

My fillet minion was seasoned perfectly and the sauce for it was delicious as well.  It was slightly overlooked, a little closer to medium, as opposed to the mid rare I ordered.  Still, I will admit, the steak won me over.

The service was pretty solid, our waitress seemed very busy.  We had a great night at George's and for that we thank him.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place until now?  The best thing about Sunday Brunch here: it is a brunch buffet.  The worst thing: it is a brunch buffet.

First off, I will say to make sure you come with an appetite.  With a $25 cost just for the food, and $12 for bottomless (yes I said bottomless) mimosas, you will want to make sure you dont drop that kind of dough to eat like a bird.

I will say, the food is worth it.  Nothing to write home about but overall pretty damn good.  The buffet has your breakfast staples: bacon, eggs, sausage, etc  but also had a carving station, salads, green beans, mac n' cheese, shell fish, pastries and desserts.  Additionally, there is a small a-la-cart menu in which you can order additional items from your waiter at no extra charge.  Some of these items include shrimp and grits, crepes, and eggs Benedict.  

My tip: save room for the mini creme brulees.  They may be worth the $25 alone."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice place to have a girlfriends brunch so we selected George's! 
Let's just say we we're not disappointed in our selection!
Our waiter was excellent, he brought sample plates for us to try and they were so delicious it left us wanting more! 
The shrimp and grits were fantastic, the raspberry dough balls with powered sugar were delightful and the brunch spread with the seafood and carving station was endless! Oh yes and what's a brunch without Mamosa's and fresh hot coffee! 
This mouthwatering brunch cost around $25pp and worth every dollar. 

For your parking needs there's a parking garage close by but why bother when George's offers valet parking! 
I'm looking forward to our next brunch at George's!"}
{"text":"The Perfect summer night consists of warm weather, a beautiful patio, delicious wine with terrific French food, wonderful service and good company :) while George's can guarantee the food and ambiance, you will have to arrange for the good company yourself and pray for ideal weather! :) 
We were there on a Saturday night and the first thing to impress me was the service! Our server Ned told us about the specials appetizers that night and he seemed so passionate about both the dishes that we were instantly convinced and ordered them - one was a curry ceviche with halibut and shrimp, and the other was kinda like inside out sushi; salmon on a bed of warm crispy rice beside chopped up sautéed shishito peppers - Amazing!! As much as we wanted to move on to their entrees (which all sounded delicious), we had to try the fiery mussels. Boy, am I glad that we did! 
Imagine a generous bowl of mussels cooked with onions, chorizo, peppers and herbs in the most delicious curry. We only got half way through finishing that bowl of mussels - partially because we filled up on their fresh, delicious bread which we dipped in to the curry. There's really no other way to truly enjoy that curry (or that bread!). We also ordered the charcuterie and pomme frittes... I quite enjoyed the pomme frittes! Sadly, I had absolutely no room for dessert. Definitely going back there soon; to indulge in their entrees and desserts. If the appetizers were this soul satisfying, I can only imagine how splendid the main course would be."}
{"text":"Doing some yelping one night i stumbled upon georges. coming from a city with alot of good french food, i came in with low expectations (as I tend to do at most clt resto's). Brought along for company an actual frenchman. That said, the ambience and decore of the place is quite nice. the escargots were nice, pommes frites were good,steak tartare was a bit on the chincy side but it was good and the mussels were nice. like most upscale restaurants in the city (especially in the south park area) the crowd was pretty old (40+). I would return."}
{"text":"Woah!  Hold the line.  This place makes you feel so awesome!!  The ambience is very Hollywood-ish with dark corners and occasional live bands, mood lighting near the bar, and a waitstaff that are the best, bar none.  I had a New Year's Eve reservation for myself and 4 friends.  The waitstaff were super professional and friendly.  The manager stopped what she was doing to come take a photo of our table so that we could all be in a photo together.  

The seafood is by far the best I have had in Charlotte (and I'm from the East Coast, so I know great seafood when I see it).  The NYE menu was a fixed 4 course meal, and it was out of this world.  

The scallops were seasoned to perfection and not over cooked.  My salad had goat's cheese and arugula that was well-washed and flavorful.  I had a peanut butter and chocolate tower for dessert that was finger licking good!  

When we were leaving, the waitress who served us ran out of the restaurant to ask if we would like a group photo in their red carpet that lead up to the entrance.  That was so unexpected and awesome.   We will now have those memories for a long time.  I would recommend this place a million times over!!  But, make a reservation ahead of time!!!!  

Be sure to try their raw bar!!  

Happy Eating!!"}
{"text":"This afternoon marked my third visit to George's, and now I am certain that we won't be back.  The food has been consistently good each time, and the service, consistently awful.  Our visit began today with the hostess telling us we would have a few minutes wait.  When she finally led us into the dining room (only about half full), she brought us to a dirty table, then realized it was dirty and walked us back out of the dining room.  Even though there were so many other open tables.  Okay, mistakes happen.  They clear the table and we finally sit down.  The server greets us several minutes later, and we order coffee.  Several minutes later, it arrives.  Warm, not hot.  We order crepes to share.  Many minutes later, the crepes come.  They are good, but covered in what seems to be canned whipped cream (the ridges in the cream kind of give it away.  I could be wrong, but that was our perception).  Server returns, asks if we would like to order anything else.  We do, as well as order more coffee.  Then he clears the main plate, but not our sharing plates or dirty silver.  Coffee takes even longer to arrive this time and is cooler than before.  Second course seems to take eons.  Server never checks on us.  Eggs Benedict is good, not great, and the potatoes that accompany taste like they were made at 11 am and held on a buffet for 3 hours.  Getting the check takes forever, but by now I am not surprised.  George's has atmosphere, and very good (not great, food) but repeatedly absent service has finally turned me off for good.  There are too many other places in Charlotte that really appreciate the business."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times for brunch, three to be exact. Two of those times I was served by a horrible waiter named Phillip who seemed to have a chip on his shoulder the entire time. My most recent trip to George's was yesterday 4/8/18. Phillip seems to have been quite impatient with my two friends and I on both occasions, we ordered the brunch buffet and he ran down the specials menu but as we were placing our order for small plates  he turned his back to serve another table of patrons. When we tried to get his attention, he put up his index finger to tell us to wait while he went to service another table - as he was in the middle of serving us. Finally, we asked for an order of beignets for the three of us. He had already explained that they come in a single serving but we specifically said we'd like some for everyone at the table. He kept repeating, so you want one beignet? As if it was more important that his verbiage of saying an order is simply one beignet. He wouldn't let it go either. Throughout our meal we felt rushed and disrespected, he came to collect empty plates and asked if i wanted to lick mine before he took it - again, in the midst of rude service, that felt disrespectful. I was highly offended and it reflected in the lack of gratuity we left him. We asked for a refill on the mini carafe of orange juice and he would only fill it halfway. We were going to order another bottle of champagne but realized our money was better spent elsewhere. Phillip is ornery, impatient and a bit of a jerk. We all remembered how poorly he treated us the last time we came and sadly, yesterday was no different. As much as we enjoy the food, George's is no longer on our list of brunch spots simply because of Phillip and his poor service. I do feel some of it was racial, as on both accounts he would leave our table mid-order to go serve a table with white patrons. He also spoke and treated them in a different tone of voice, a very noticeable difference. This was experienced on two separate occasions months apart from each other, Phillip is a problem."}
{"text":"One of our most faves, excellent food and drinks specials daily between 3-7pm.
Great atmosphere and good service with great food. French Music plays often to our delight and dinner is romantic!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a lot of fun, has a great menu, authentic french decor and a lot of seating space.  We had our company holiday lunch here last week and I was super impressed!

The waitress had a french accent so I truly felt like I was in a french cafe/bistro from the moment I walked in.  She was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu so she guided us through the entire 2-hour lunch. 

We started with a couple appetizers...the calamari (the dipping sauce to accompany the calamari was fabulous) and a cheese plate.  The cheese plate also came with a relish, honey mustard sauce and a fig compote....all which paired perfectly with the cheese offered.  The calamari was perfectly crisp, not chewy and seasoned well.  Overall, great appetizers!  


I ordered the Yellow and Red Beet Salad which came with candied pistachios, feta, oranges, olive oil and arugula.  It was pretty good but I realized I am not a big \"beet\" person so I wasn't really thrilled with my choice.  My only other complaint is that the portion was very small.  I know these are lunch portions and we had plenty of appetizers but truly this was more of a side salad.  However, it had good flavor and if someone loves beets then this would certainly satisfy!  Everyone at the table loved their meals.  Some got the chicken salad on a croissant, one person ordered the grilled steak salad (which was apparently cooked to perfection), and one other person ordered the grilled chicken sandwich (pretty boring, I know).  Most of the lunch entrees are served with your choice of regular pomes frites (or skinny french fries for us common folk :) or sweet potato fries.  The pomes frites were tasty and savory...not too oily and not too salty.  Overall, everyone was super satisfied with their options.  I also forgot to mention the warm sliced baguettes that were served prior to our entrees....YUMMY!  There is nothing like french bread and this bread tasted so fresh and the butter just melted on so smoothly.  The crust was crunchy but not hard and the center was soft but not too yeasty (yes I made that word up).  It was just perfect!  I should have asked if they made it in house!

My favorite part of this meal was of course the dessert!  We left no stone unturned...we wanted to sample pretty much everything!  We were told they make all of their desserts in house so we were all excited about their pastry options.  Once again, France is known for their pastries so this was a true test of the authenticity of this restaurant!  

By this point the manager was loving us so he sent out a plate of chocolate covered strawberries on the house.  They were amazing...tasted like one of those $5 godiva chocolate strawberries.  Then, the feast began...the chocolate mousse, the nutella cream puffs,  and the creme brule all made their presence known.  The mousse was rich and creamy, the nutella cream puffs came with a side of chocolate sauce so you could really make it special but the winner of the day was awarded to the Creme Brule!!  I'm not even a huge creme brule fan but let me tell you...this was amazing!  It was soooo creamy and flavorful.  It was a perfect balance between a custard and flan.  The consistency was just perfect and the bourbon vanilla flavor was done just right.  I loved all of the desserts but this one had my heart.

Once again, I love to support local places so this restaurant definitely has my vote.  There are many other items on the menu that I would like to try but what we had last week was fabulous.  They have live music from time to time and they are having a huge New Year's Eve party.  It would be worth checking out their website periodically so you can learn about some of their events.  They also participated in restaurant week last spring (I attended), which was a great way to taste some of their most popular menu items."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place for dinner. My wife said the she-crab soup w/ wedge salad was great. I had the blackened halibut and it was also good. We arrived almost 30 min early and they offered to sit is immediately which was nice. Good food good service just a little pricey."}
{"text":"Although we had an awful experience the manager called 2 days later and apologized. He offered to have us come back as his guests to experience the brunch the way we planned to.  Thank you and we look forward to a different experience.

Incredibly disappointed.  We made a reservation after hearing such wonderful things about this brunch. I went on line and saw $12 bottomless mimosa and $25 brunch. Knowing that another couple would love this I asked them to go as well. My husband and I arrived first and we were seated immediately.  We sat at a 4 top in the middle of the restaurant and for at least 5 minutes we were completely ignored not a glass of water or a good morning from anyone as they passed our table. We were already put off because this is supposed to be an upscale French restaurant  .  The waiter finally comes to our table pours our water and tells us the bottomless mimosas are no longer- I told him it's on their website and he said they can't \"it's illegal\".  Manager comes over and basically said it is illegal and there is nothing he can do.  WHAT?  Its on their website - you could offer a free round or 2 to make up for it - you are false advertising!!  He said if we are unhappy we could leave -SO WE DID and had a wonderful brunch at The Fishmarket in Baxter Village."}
{"text":"What a great brunch spot on the weekend!  $25 gets you a high-class all you can eat buffet that is very well maintained well worth the price.  Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable and one of the main reasons my family and I will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in charlotte!! 
My favorite item on the menu is the fiery mussels with fries & bread! I love this place so much that we had our rehearsal dinner there!! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"They earned most of their stars simply by not flinching when my friends and I walked in one night last week at 9:40pm looking for dinner (apparently they close at 10pm). While hostess was MIA, I walked up to the empty bar, and asked if they're still serving. The gentleman in chef uniform said \"YES, kitchen is open until 10pm\" with enthusiasm. I wonder if it would have been the same if it was a host/hostess greeting us instead. The \"chef\" sat us out at the patio per our request, soon after we were greeted by our waitress.  Service in general was great considering our untimely arrival. 

We ordered a collection of dishes. The scallop entrée ($27) was fabulous. The 4 scallops were perfectly seared. The poached lobster small plate ($13) was small, and quite frankly the potato gnocchi stole the show. I could just eat a plate of the gnocchi instead (and ideally be cheaper). I am a foie gras newbie, only had it once before, and I found this one to be relatively tasteless. The duck confit offered great flavor, but the duck leg was surprisingly dry. The steak tartare was probably the best tasting and sizable appetizer out of all that we ordered. 

Overall it was a very enjoyable dinner. And I appreciate a restaurant that knows how to welcome business instead of turning us away. Solid 3.5 stars for food, but extra 0.5 star for great attitude."}
{"text":"$12 Bottomless Mimosas
$25 Breakfast Buffet

Charlotte's best kept secret for Sunday Funday Brunch! Totally worth the price - especially if you love mussels, oysters, and shrimp. Everything is in abundance and fresh! The buffet options are plentiful and have your breakfast staples. Some things are also made to order. Can't go wrong with brunch here, just make sure you place a reservation or arrive earlier than the actual time you want to eat.

Sunday Funday - no doubt!"}
{"text":"I found George's for Restaurant week and had no previous knowledge of it.  I wanted to come in to the experience completely blind.   I was surprised at how good the food was, and how well portioned the plates were.    It was a Thursday, so I kicked off the night with a $5 girly martini (a guy sometimes just wants to have a pretty drink) .   Here is where we found out about the $1 Oyster bar during happy hour, which I will definitely be coming back to experience. 

Dinner consisted of 3 Courses, which accompaniment of great bread and butter. 1st course was the pork belly. I came into it excepting a small sliver of meat. This was not the case, I received large square hunk of awesomely tender and juicy belly, with tangy drizzled sauce.  A+

The main course, I ventured out the normal and got the crusty salmon with really tasty Black Rice. It was great for the variety, but I would say if you want the standard preferred experience of a main meal, try the short ribs.

Desert was a crème brulee, and one of the best that I have had in recent memory. My counterparts got the chocolate mousse and there was a ton of it, all of it fluffy and smooth.

The only thing that was a slight knock was the time it took to get the food, but I wouldn't ding them a star for it, because of restaurant week and dealing with the influx of people.   Also, allowed us to have some friendly table banter.

Go here for a good French food experience.  Maybe valet your car to, if you don't want to deal with the maze of parking decks and doors."}
{"text":"Went for brunch in December 2012.  Nothing special in terms of food, although the location, decor, etc, are top-notch.

Had the ham omelette.   It was a tad overdone.   The ham was listed as 'jambon français'  (French ham) and Gruyère cheese, although the ham was clearly local pre-sliced ham and not the kind of ham you actually find in France (I travel in France and speak French, so I am not guessing), and the Gruyère was hard to sense.  The 'hash browns' were really just deep fried potato chunks, a bit overcooked.

So, make no mistake, the food was good, but not outstanding, at least in the international sense.   On the balance, had an experience similar to eating at Panera, although at a higher cost."}
{"text":"Date night, my lovely wife requested that we find a place that offered French Onion Soup. Turning to Yelp, I put the car in gear and headed towards South Park and Piedmont Row. Quite busy when we arrived, there was no reasonable parking to be had. It seems that some people have a different definition of \"compact\" that somehow includes the Toyota Land Cruiser and Mercedes S-class. So I handed over my car to the complimentary valet and we headed inside.

Despite not having a reservation, the hostess was able to bring us to a table immediately. She left us with the regular menus as well as the Queen's Feast menu plus the wine list. Classy surroundings, I felt seriously under dressed in jeans and a polo shirt. It just has the feel that something fancier would have fit in better.

While it took our waiter a few minutes to arrive for our drinks order (no, they don't have a non-alcohol wine), he was knowledgeable, friendly and exhibited a welcoming spirit. I chose to order from the special menu, starting with the mussels and then having the garlic and mushrooms pappardelle for main course. A good sized portion of mussels arrived in a creamy sauce that had onions and was soaked up well by the fantastic sliced French bread that was brought to the table. If you're a mussels fan, you'll love these.

Rather than try the soup, my wife read the Yelp reviews and went straight to the goat cheese and caramelized onion tart. Thank goodness, she let me have one bite. Heavenly. Absolutely excellent! And for her main course, she selected the roast duck breast. Medium slices of tender duck on top of a parsnip puree with roasted Brussels sprouts. Amazingly good stuff.

For dessert, we split a creme brûlée. Perfectly candied shell on top, creamy filling with two perfect raspberries as garnish.

I kid you not, my wife said \"That was the best meal I have ever had in the United States.\" So it has that going for it.

George's will likely be our \"go to\" spot for romantic evenings."}
{"text":"I've been to George's twice and both times I've really enjoyed myself.  The Onion Soup is to die for.  The onions are *deeply* caramelized and it gives the soup and a really hearty and earthy flavor.  Topped with a well-browned slice of Gruyere, it was honestly the best onion soup I've had outside of France.

The entree portions are quite generous.  I had the Cassoulet the first time, which was good, but I couldn't even come close to finishing.  The second time I learned my lesson and had a second appetizer for my entree, a fresh salmon crudo.  Not exactly French homestyle cooking, but very tasty.

The service was excellent.  The waiters were attentive, and refilled our waters whenever they got low, and they leave chilled re-sealable bottles of water on the table too.  Splitting multiple carafes of the house wine proved no problem when it came to the bill.

If there was one problem with Georges, its that they don't have very much vegetarian fare.  One entree (Ratatouille), and a few appetizers were the only options."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a 5 today but my server led me to only leave a 3. The food never disappoints me. Always bring mussel lovers to Georges there are not many of us. 
I was greeting well as the restaurant was not busy. Requested to sit outside its was a beautiful afternoon. 
My sever wasn't in the greatest moods and I felt a little slighted. Now I will not play the race card but it sure felt like it. Ordered the amazing calamari the server sat it on the table left and never came back. He did pass by but never said a word. We knew it had to come with a sauce but her never checked to see if things were ok. When he returned I asked about the sauce and he stated yes it comes with one. Did you not get it? No we didn't. Sorry he said. 
He never removed a single plate someone came behind him. But we notice plates being removed from his other tables. Water glass remained empty with a full bottle on the shelf behind us. We didn't receive a bottle of water on our table. Interesting
I requested something a few time later received. I watched this young gentleman serve others and not us. We watched him pass us by with out a word. 
Being in the food industry I know great food and great service this time George you only had one. Please due cook the mussels just a bit more we had a few wiggles. 
I didn't leave my standard 20,00 tip because I felt we were over looked. Not a good feeling I wrote a note on the receipt. Be more attentive. Here is 8.00 for you time. I could have wrote more but what the heck.. I so hate bad reviews. Let me say the other servers were great I just wish we had one of those."}
{"text":"Decent place, stars more for variety than quality of gourmet food. The omelet making station was pretty good(you can add sautéed sweet peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, bacon, ham, sausage, gruyere, white cheddar and goat cheese). 

The French toast was pretty decent. The breakfast potatoes were ok...they looked better than tasted. Pommes Frites, skinny fries, were good--you order those from the waiter. One portion is good to split. The mac and cheese was good, terribly decadent! 

The coffee was so terrible, like watered down dirt. Cost $2.50 but not worth getting if you are a coffee connoisseur. OJ was alright, $3/glass. 

They had a great selection. Quality wasn't amazing but it is a buffet...so I'm not shocked. 

If you have a special occasion or big group, it's a good spot to go to. Beautiful interior and outdoor seating.  Nice bathroom, too. 

Wouldn't rush back here but if you have a craving for lots of different brunch foods it's a good place! $25 per person. Coffee and juice not included."}
{"text":"Came for Restaurant Week.  Good variety on the menu.  Overall very good dinners, but service was only fair.  One of us had the Coq Au Vin.   Too heavy; all dark meat. Two of us had the Scottish Salmon.  Phenomenal.   Not heavy or oily, as some salmon can be. Black garlic beurre blanc was just the right accompaniment.  For dessert, the creme brûlée may have been the best I've had.   Overall very good restaurant.   Maybe not the best ever, but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I had never dined at George's Brasserie, but took advantage of a business opportunity to entertain a guest here.  The weather was perfect so we chose to eat on the patio instead of the dining room.  The server was very knowledgeable and friendly.  On her recommendation, I selected the pork belly appetizer followed by the Beeler Farms pork chop.  I know, I ran the risk of OD'ing on pork.  The pork belly was good but not fantastic.  I'll try a different appetizer next time I go.  The pork chop on the other hand was out of this world!  Tender and flavorful served over palenta and ringed with fried Brussels sprouts.  I will definitely go back on my own nickle to get the pork chop."}
{"text":"My wife and I love French food, but it took us a while to try this place. It's now our favorite French restaurant in Charlotte. We started off with some $1 oysters (happy hour special) and some Onion soup. The soup actually used the lion crocks that you see in Paris, and it had just the right amount of wine in the broth. It was among the best we've ever tried. My main course was a bison bourginon. I've never had braised bison, but this dish will make me want to make it at home. The meat was tender and flavorful. The pearl onions were caramelized, yet retained a soft and satisfying crunch. My only concern was that it was undersalted, but this was an easy fix with a twist of the salt grinder. My wife had the chicken, which is a half-bird cooked all-at-once (rather than partially cooked and reheated). It was juicy, well-seasoned, and served with mashed potatoes and a truffle sauce.  We skipped out on dessert because we had our fill. 

The ambiance was perfect, with cafe-style tables outside, a mid-20th century Parisian decor inside, and Yves Montand playing softly over the speakers. Our server was friendly, genuine, and transparent when it came to describing the dishes. She made us feel welcome, comfortable, and appreciated. The rest of the staff were warm and inviting as well.

Overall, we loved Georges Brasserie and plan to come here several times a year from now on."}
{"text":"Another great experience. Awesome New York Strip Steak. They took on Del Frisco's across the street with this steak. Very good unique steak sauce, perfect amount of pepper corns and just nailed the cooking to perfection. The frites that come with the steak are average.

Tried a couple of outstanding French wines that you usually do not find in restaurants. The $8 glass was a better value compared to the $14 glass

Great service"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food and drinks.
Top notch at a great price! Loved the venison!"}
{"text":"Very average French- nothing that made me sit up in excitement.   My friend often holds vendor meals here, our service was lackluster at best.   We had to prompt after ridiculous wait for check- reason is bar was understaffed so our server was also bartender.   We made our reservations specifying special event.  Disappointing so much potential."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. Piedmont Row with the fountain easily seen from the outside seating. Mussles are incredible, the bread is even better. It is very relaxing and a chance to unwind after a long week. The food is good, the bill is higher than you thought it should be though. All in all it was a nice time and a beautiful night."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy this restaurant and tonight's visit seem to be going well. Waiter was great and drinks were delicious. We ordered calamari, crab cakes and mussels to share.  The crab cakes were delicious and so was the calamari, however. half way through we found a hair in the dish.  Obviously not on of our own because it was caked in the calamari batter.  We all know this can happen and when we told the waiter he promptly took the plate saying he would show the manager.  Our mussels were brought out later and they were yummy, as well.  The issue came when we received our check with the calamari on it.  Not only did we find the hair but the waiter took away half of the order once we found it.  Absolutely no reason why it should have been on our bill.  Very disappointed about this."}
{"text":"Yay for Charlotte Restaurant Week!  Got to try this place out last night with a large group of friends.  Our server was awesome, even though the place was packed for a Thursday night - we got to take our time, enjoy the food, good company, and great ambiance that Georges offers.

What I ordered off of the restaurant week menu was a shrimp starter over a bed of red pepper risotto.  My main entree was a seared snapper cooked perfectly over rice.  And my dessert was the apple tart which really said everything to me as far as how the meal went.    I am a sucker for apple anything, but it was a great dessert.

Some of my friends ordered similar and some ordered off the regular menu as well.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the experience and hopefully we can all come back - even if it's not restaurant week."}
{"text":"I came here with the dinner group and I have to say that every aspect of this place was fabulous starting with the reservation process to the final check.

When I made the reservation for 12 people, the hostess asked me a little about the dinner group, if we had special request and if we were true to our time.  Someone called back the following day and asked if the reservation was still correct.  We had one cancellation and were down to 11 and she said she had the perfect round table for us that fits 11 people.  Awesome.

I arrived early and sat at the bar.  They have great bar-only appetizer specials of $3, $5 or $7 from 3-7 Monday through at least Thursday.  The items sounded tasty and from the aromas from orders from the people next to me, I could only assume they tasted amazing.  

One appetizer really stuck out to me, the crispy brussels sprouts leaves.  When I mentioned this to the bartender, he said this was taken from their pork chop entree and made the recommendation of trying that for dinner.  And so it was noted.

On to dinner.  There was a slight disappointment with our group when we found out we were not eating at the round table as noted above but they instead put us at the front of the restaurant against the window with a nice view of the fountain at Piedmont Town Center.  

Our server, Laura, was phenomenal.  I would recommend her to anyone visiting this restaurant.  She knew the menu, often asked you what you thought of appetizers or your entree, etc.  The real kicker with Laura is that we noticed she had an accent and were curious as to where she was from.  She made us guess and after that she spent at least 10 minutes with us talking about her country and why she came here, her family etc.  I've never had a server do that in all of my life.  It made this dining experience that much more incredible.  '

As for dinner, the pork chop was huge and flavorful.  The polenta was cheesy and creamy.  Yum.  And the brussells sprouts where a nice tasty garnish.  The pork chop was so big, I ended up bringing half of it home.

The place is a little expensive but the service was so worth it.  For groups of 8 or more, they add a 20% tip to the check but you can add more if you want.  I did.  Believe me, I did.  Laura received a 60% tip from me.  

Love the decor of this place.  Classy with drapes separating different areas and pictures of French landmarks, fashion and culture.

What capped off this experience is when the bartender came out the door as we were leaving and asked me what I though of the meal.   Honestly, if I could rate this place 7 stars, I would.  I think I just found my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte.

In summary, when you go there, make a reservation and ask for Laura B as your server, start at the bar with the daily specials, and for your entree, try the pork chop!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was much better than expected. I think what frightens most people away is how \"french\" it is. If you are in the SouthPark area, this place is a must. Its actually astounding how mellow it is. With prices, service, and food like this, you would expect this place to be slammed until it closes."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere. Everything is always perfect. I have never had anything other than great food and service here. Our server on our most recent trip was Jeremiah and he was the best. I can only think of wonderful things to say about the whole experience."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago for their happy hour (3-7pm Mon through Friday in the bar area). $5 Stoli martinis on Thursdays? Yes please. We also got an assortment of apps, all very reasonably priced from $3-7. I highly recommend the sliders, they were amazing! Calamari was good, but not mind-blowing."}
