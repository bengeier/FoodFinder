{"text":"Best fajitas I've ever had.  I also enjoyed trying to ask the Mariachis about their instruments.  My ex-husband, who claims he doesn't speak Spanish, translated for me.  :)  I've been three times and I haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is a gem, although it looks more like plain old rock from the outside.  Don't let the looks fool you.  Took the better half to dinner here last week and she was a bit apprehensive from the start.  Small parking lot, not much to look at on the outside, and really not too much on the inside either.  But the food changes everything.  I had the molcajete, which had beef, chicken, chorizo, some cotija cheese and a nopale.  It came out piping hot in a big bowl with beans and guacamole on the side.  Fantastic.  Even better were the made-in-house corn tortillas served with it.  Just take a little bit of everything and wrap it in one of those fantastic tortillas and your taste buds will thank you.  My girlfriend had the fajitas and from what I tried, they were fantastic as well.   When she couldn't finish hers and we had it wrapped for home, they threw in some extra homemade corn tortillas.  Great place if you are ever on that side of town.  Good food and friendly service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm now 1500 miles away, and desperate for a place as good as this.  La Barquita, and especially their Molcajete Mexicano, was the place I would take every out-of-town visitor to truly enjoy the best of what Phoenix has to offer.  The chips and salsa could use a bit of improvement, but here, it's the entree's you come for.  Don't let the humble location and bars on the windows fool you, this is the place you want to patronize (full well knowing that I'm truly jealous!)."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I stopped in today at 6:30 pm and was greeted by a rude waitress that told us to sit anywhere with an attitude. I asked her if they sold \"tejuino\", a traditional Mexican beverage. The waitress responded by saying \"not right now\". Being that the sale of this beverage is advertised on their Facebook page, I would expect them to sell it. The fact that they weren't selling it isn't what upset me the most, it's that she didn't even tell me when they would be selling it or apologize for not having it.  With so many Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, I hope they get their act together. People will not accept rude service and will go else where"}
{"text":"WOW! Actual true Mexican food, not Mexican American or TexMex style, BUT real authentic Mexican food. We had the molcajete and chile rellenos and they were legit. Home made corn tortillas were beyond perfect. Service was amazing as well! The boyfriend and I are both Mexican and it felt like going to our mom's house to eat! This place will now be our Mexican go-to Spot! No more fake Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This a small but very good place if you are looking for authentic mexican food! Love their molcajetes and birria delicious!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to La Barquita earlier this week. We both had the chile relleno, because we think it is better than the chicken or beef. We the saw them serve another dish that looked amazing. We will be going back soon. It's very affordable too."}
{"text":"This was a great find and completely out of my comfort zone but on my quest to find great Mexican food in this state I used yelp and gave it a shot. I was not disappointed.  I honestly felt like I was in Mexico. I had the Carnitas lunch with homemade tortillas which were delicious."}
{"text":"I agree, the Molcajete was awesome (even for $12). Unlike anything I've had. Great seasoning & flavor. The bottom of the bowel has loose chorizo & steak was tender. My wife loved it too. Margaritas were ok. Chile Rellano was not that good. Super cold Tacate served with lime & salt. Salsa was mild & needed salt/heat added but agree good smokey flavor. Will definitely go back for the Molcajete & Tacate. Solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"I went here because of all the great photos on Yelp, and I was NOT disappointed.  My husband and I both ordered the pork carnitas fajitas.  I don't know if I can order anything else, they were so good.  The chips came out with a smoky and hot salsa.  The fajitas came out sizzling.  There were green and red peppers, onions and mushrooms with the perfectly cooked pork.  Oh my, this skinny girl ate a lot!  I can't wait to go back.    I am thrilled as I don't like the cheesy Sonoran fare served at most Mexican restaurants around town."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always top notch and the service always makes me feel like I am at a family members home! Don't let the exterior fool you, this is the real deal. They have the best corn tortillas I have ever had in my life. Once they know that you enjoy spicy food they will bring out the good stuff which is absolutely amazing! Far and away, one of my two favorite Mexican restaurants that I feel all out of town visitors must try! Thanks for all you do, from a gabacho cab driver"}
{"text":"Came in at 8am, the huevos rancheros just the right amount of spice delicious tortillas ?"}
{"text":"Happy camper!!! Seven years in Arizona and barely found this place. True mexican food. Delicious!  Got the molcajete for 2 it was soo good."}
{"text":"This place is hole-in-the-wall awesome.  I had the shrimp fajitas and they were bomb!  Their refried beans are unique, they're not gross like you'd usually expect - they were flavorful and delicious.  The guac was top-notch as well.  However, their service was really, really slow today.  Only go for a work lunch if you have the time to spare!!"}
{"text":"Molcajete a la Mexicana with fresh homemade corn tortillas--best Mexican food I have ever had!  The place is older, with bars on the windows and Mexican soap operas on the TV, but I kinda loved the atmosphere.  Free chips with smokey salsa were good, and the food arrived quickly and sizzling hot.  Seriously delicious!  Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"if you have never eaten here you are missing out on some of the best mexican food in phx. Their sauces are great, the mexican dish molcajete is fabulous. His margaritas and regular drinks are great. dont miss this place."}
{"text":"I was introduced to La Barquita by a friend a few weeks ago and was impressed. Mi Suegra is from Jalisco and her cooking has made my palate very discriminating of Mexican food. I went back with her the other day and we loved it!  La Barquita jumped to the top of my list for all-time best Mexican Food!   The flavors are tremendous. The Carne Asada was prepared to perfection. The salsa is top shelf. If you want authentic Mexican cuisine, this is the place. No frills, just a good tasting meal in a comfortable setting. The service was good too."}
{"text":"I came here a few times and the food was delightful.. Loved the pancakes and the home made corn tortillas. The missing star is for the service. They are really Nice, but they need more staff.. The prices are very reasonable. Im deffinitely coming back."}
{"text":"This local jewel of a Mexican restaurant is probably the best food that I've had in a very long time everything was perfect the shrimp were excellent--- taste the rice it was deadly and the beans were the best refried beans I've had since a vacation trip to Mexico a few years ago.  This isn't a fancy Mexican restaurant and this is the real deal and the steak was cooked perfectly not burned very soft and extremely flavorful .Try both tortillas I prefer the corn over the flower but both of them were excellent! This place is very reasonably priced and the service was fast and the staff was very loveable and did their best to make us feel right at home. I will be going back !"}
{"text":"This is great Authentic Mexican food for a great price.  I went for Happy Hour had their appetizers they were delicious.  I didnt like their Margaritas.  But thats ok the good food made up for it.  I had breakfast with a friend a few weeks later and it was just delicious.  I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I feel like this is the place that us \"Gringos\" are looking for when we are trying to get the inside scoop on the best Mexican food hidden gem in the city."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Get the molcajete.  Good stuff.  The salsa needed a little more kick and freshness."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time in only because first time I came in I was unable to use my restaurant.com certificate. FYI if you have one you have to have it printed.   Other than that, the portions are a great size. Best be careful some of those pictures are a lot bigger than you think. First time I had the breakfast combo pancakes, ham etc. The picture does not give the size a good umm...estimate i guess. The plate i received was huge and barely finished it. The pancakes were delicious. I think they put cinnamon maybe just a bit of sugar in their batter but it was slightly sweetened and just so good.   Steak and eggs are what I had this trip. The steak was a lot thinner than I expected. I asked for steak sauce but ended up not using it. The steak was nicely seasoned I didn't need it. That plate was the perfect size that I felt satisfied but not overly stuffed.   Service compared to the first time was an upgrade. The first time I came in it was a Sunday morning and it was busy. Service was mediocre at best nothing bad nothing good. This time a Friday morning the place was quiet and our server was pleasant and friendly. She kept our drinks full and checked in on us regularly.   Overall I guess it's just timing which will change the service you receive. The food is worth a stop though. I had to laugh because when my food arrived I stopped to say to my boyfriend these look and taste like my grandma made these eggs."}
{"text":"Very Authentic food!! Fresh made tortillas no matter what time of day you go! Excellent service and excellent food!!"}
{"text":"Delicious...go look at my review in \"tips\", (sorry, app was on the fritz) you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my second time getting lunch here, and the Food is always great.  i will be comeing back."}
{"text":"We had the molcajete (shrimp and mexicana).  Wow!  Fantastic!  Served in a very hot stone bowl along with tortillas, refried beans, and guacamole this dish is something we will go back for again and again.  The salsa that came with the chips was a brown salsa that was mildly spicy and very delicious.  The decor is casual - a real neighborhood type hangout.  Our only complaint was the volume of the two TVs in the two small rooms.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Never again. I was so excited to try this restaurant based on the reviews but was disappointed by their service. First, they served chips with salsa (which was good) but for a party of 5, they served very little. We asked for more and they told us they had ran out of chips. Wait, that wasn't even the problem. I was the first to get my carne asada burrito and our waitress says, \"we gave you extra beans because we've ran out of rice. Is that OK?\" I didn't want to be rude about it but what kind of Mexican restaurant runs out of chips and rice? Oh, needless to say, they served canned soda, and when we asked for another Pepsi...guess what they said? They ran out! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Rosita's place, which is a block down was beyond better!"}
{"text":"We were in town looking for a good Mexican restaurant. Well we found it! Ordered a single Molcajete for myself, green Chile, milanesa plater and a few kids meals. Well everything was amazing! Totally recommend the molcajete you won't regret it. It had chicken, steak, grill nopale, grill chile,cheese,tomato,  HOMEMADE chorizo! All on top of some homemade salsa. DELICIOUS!!! To top it off all our meals came with homemade corn tortillas. Can't go wrong with the food here. Oh yeah their beans, ahhh we all loved. I think they put chorizo in them. They are no ordinary refried beans."}
{"text":"We go to this restaurant at a lot. In fact we have been going weekly. Well the service went down hill, just in our last three visits. There is an older lady that has waited on us for the past 7 years. She is awesome. When our car pulls up in the parking lot and she sees us outside the kitchen window, she makes my boyfriend an I a bowl of Pico de Gillo, fresh and spicy.  The new girls barely listen to your order. I asked for mayo and the girl brought out a little cup of dried out crusty mayo. My boyfriend told her I didn't want it so she took it back, and of course this was all said in Spanish, so I didn't know he hadn't told her I wanted new stuff. So I asked him to ask her for more. She brought out a bigger dish with fresh mayo. When I got the bill she charged me $2.00 for the mayo. What the heck.  I ask another girl and she said well you got the big one. I explained the situation and she said I will charge you    90 cents. I had never in 7 years been charged for mayo. The girls are rude and only become nice when it gets close to bringing the check. I think I will try the one two places down.  I am still trying to figure out if the owners were on vacation. Food wasn't the same as when the older man is there either."}
{"text":"Had family come in unexpectedly the other night and they wanted good Mexican food and margaritas near the airport. Someone suggested Macayos. I said no. I'm gonna find some authentic Mexican food and I did. I did a search in the area and found this place. Amazing! Authentic food!  margaritas and very reasonably priced. I had the seafood Molcajetes! Amazing!! ! Huge portions and delicious authentic Mexican food!! Will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Best Chile rellano ever!"}
{"text":"The place is not high scale place but the food is delicious.  The pozole was good with fresh hand made tortillas.  Chips and the famous salsa.  Shop local, support local businesses.  Prices are reasonable from $5 - $11"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have had while traveling. Me and my wife love Mexican food and we always find a Mexican restaurant while on trips. We were in town for spring training and made it to this restaurant for dinner. When we arrived we weren't greeted right away. We did not know if we. Redes to wait or just take a seat. Eventually the waitress gave us a table. Drinks came out promptly and we're served in a 32 oz cup Instead of a common 16-22oz cup. No refill was needed. I always have chiles rellenos and I must say the chiles rellenos here are the best chile rellenos i have ever had including my moms. Sorry mom! My wife had the molcajete and she loved it so much as well that she talked about it for days. We seriously considered going back the next morning for breakfast but we had to get on the road early. I do think they can operate it a bit different like having a hostess dedicated to just seating and charging customers. Currently at least on the day we went there were 2 waitresses that seemed to be juggling a lot more duties than they should. Overall food gets a 10/10 from me. While service gets 7/10 based on waitresses being overwhelmed with duties they can't focus on the customer. I had to go look for one so I could get my bill."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding and casual Mexican restaurant that serves the best \"Birria\"  I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"I would give it a good review but the chicken portions was something you will give to your dog. Why would you give a customer the backend of a chicken. It has no point. It no meat. I don't get it. Other than that. The food was good. I hope someone from the restaurant reads this so it will not happen again.  I will not be back again if I come to Phoenix. Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"We had the mexican eggs and the eggs with machaca both with beans and rice.My wife had flour tortillas and I had corn tortillas, both were perfectly cooked and seasoned. This place is super solid on all levels. We went back and tried to estimate how many meals we have eaten here and we average 1 time a month for the past 4 plus years so approximately 45+ meals and we will continue to frequent this place in the future. Side note the Micheladas yesterday were delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  This place is the very definition of a 'hole in the wall' and it totally delivers on every level.  I have had the Chile Colorado, Steak Picado, and sampled the Chicken Mole.....all have been fantastic.  And if you like real homemade corn tortillas...this is the place to go.  If you go while they have Happy Hour, don't be afraid to order the Margarita.  It's not  the usual pint sized glass you get at most Happy Hours....this is a legitimate fullsize 'Rita!  I can't wait to go back again to try something new!"}
{"text":"Once Sunday morning rolls around, you can find my Mom and me at La Barquita for some classic Mexican eats. Located in a small building with bars on the windows in Phoenix, this is definitely a book you don't want to judge by it's cover. As you step through the doors you feel as if you are walking into a home kitchen.  I always get the Molcajete Mexicano because it provides a very flavorful variety of chicken, carne asada, chorizo, nopales, tomatoes and cheese. The Molcajete also come s with rice, beans, and your choice of flour or corn tortillas.  My Mother and Aunt always get the Caldo de Rez since the beef stew reminds them of the soup their mother used to make. In addition to big chunks of beef, the soup has heart potatoes, veggies, and corn on the cob.  I highly recommend this place for delicious homemade Mexican food."}
{"text":"The menudo was good but the service was horrible, we had asked for hot chocolate and they didn't wait till the end (we kept asking for it several times) to tell us that the machine was not working. They cook a long time to bring the menudo out and when they did they only brought two out, then 10 minuets later they brought the other two out and that was only because we had to ask them. My experience here was horrible I will not be coming back here and would not recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"Tried out La Barquita based on a Newtimes article.  Already heard the molcajete was amazing so thought I'd try something different on the menu.  Barquita is on the NW corner of 24th st & McDowell.  It is in an small unattractive building.  The inside is nothing nice.  Old floral wallpaper stripes across the middle of the rozay colored walls that have cracks and missing plaster and some funky white tiled floors.  There were lots of cool maps of Mexico hanging on the walls.  I tried picturing how cool they would look on some freshly painted walls and saltillo floors.  My waitress brought out some chips and salsa.  The salsa was on the plain side.  It didn't pack heat nor did it do anything for my taste buds.  Kind of fell flat and left me second guessing what was to come.  The meal however is worthy of a the trip.  I ordered the chimi lunch special.  $4.99 for rice, beans, and a steak chimi.    The rice was cooked to perfection.  Nice and soft but not mushy.  Hot, fresh,  and had carrots and peas the way I love.  The beans were very tasty.  They had an awesome flavor to them and melted in your mouth.  Usually the beans and rice at most joints are very weak and these stood out as some of the best in recent memory and were very unexpected.  The chimi was steaming hot,  nicely fried and was filled with meat and beans inside.  The meat was seasoned well but I could tell it had been reheated and had a couple of chunks of fat in it.  I would have liked freshly grilled meat, not reheated.  It would have also been nice to throw some pico or something else inside to balance the flavor but it was still pretty tasty.  La Barquita has some real potential and I would definitely give it another try.  There are some things that could be done to make it a sweet little gem.  But for 5 bucks for chips, salsa, rice, beans, and a chimi it is hard to complain.  You can't get a combo meal for that at most fast food joints these days.  With all the men out of work these days they could easily hire someone to fix the plaster, paint, and re-tile that place on the cheap.  Spice up the salsa, filter the water, and cook the meat fresh to order and the place would easily earn 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"When I arrived, the parking lot looked semi-empty. And that was the first error in my judgment. As I walked in, well, I couldn't. They were just that packed with people waiting for a table. At first, I thought only the local area knew about it, but, looking at the tables, there was a clear cross section of locals and foodies alike. Three wrong assumptions in 30 seconds. Lets raise that number even more.   I figured they would be priced reasonably, and at first glance, I was correct. And then I saw the price of the margaritas. $4 for a margarita not on a happy hour schedule, it couldn't possibly be a reasonably sized margarita, or for that matter, a quality margarita for that price. Remember how I said I was going to make bad assumptions, well, there was another. It was the best damn margarita I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. Flavorful, sweet, tangy, salty, cold, and served with a saldito.  And then I thought, my plate will be reasonably sized. Oops. The sopes were large, plentiful, and filled with beef.  And the flavor.  The meat was tender and well marinated. The sopes themselves were crispy on the outside and almost fluffy inside. If you're not familiar with Mexican food, think of a sope as fried grits fritter, shaped like a bowl.  It was seriously more than I bargained for. And at $10, it was a steal.  My lady ordered the molcajete for one.  Fair warning, it is a single serving, provided that you are about the size of Shaq.  A gigantic stone bowl filled with beef, chicken, nopale (cactus leaf), chorizo, green onion, and salsa at the bottom.  We split it with our daughter.   As for our youngling, she went for the shrimp tostada, ceviche style. Again, a supervised portion.  I'll let the photos describe it.  The fact is, you should make a point to go here. And if you don't like this place, you likely think that Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I'm really glad I discovered La Barquita this week! A Mexican restaurant serving Jalisco style food. Jalisco is a state in southern Mexico where the tastiest dishes, the warmest people and the most traditional cultures of that country come from (Mariachi, Tequila and yours truly! Lol). Joking aside... This place has the best Birria I've tasted outside of Mexico. It is made the real Jalisco way, with goat meat and not beef, which is hard to find in the US. Plus... their hand made corn tortillas are delicious.  I've only tasted their Birria so this review is strictly based on that. But if you like goat meat or want to try something new, spicy and authentic... this is the place to be! The owners of the place are also very nice and will take care of you if it's your first time there... but trust me, It won't be your last!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place about 5 times now. The Birria is absolutely delicious ! Comes with freshly made corn tortillas. Highly recommend for people seeking authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Up until tonight I was willing to consider this restaurant as one the best Mom and pop Mexican restaurants in Phx. We've been coming here at least once a week for about the last 8 months and yeah we use the 20% off coupon when we do, so what, we always tip accordingly. Anyways about the first two visits were amazing, food was excellent, hot and plentiful, I almost felt like I was being undercharged. Service was great too even though our server was pregnant she never let us go thirsty. Then we noticed the last few visits, food and service starting to go downhill, I was in denial because I love their fajitas so much. Beans were coming out first and weren't really hot almost cold. My wife and I don't eat rice so when we say hold the rice just double the beans, they never come out double. Other things started slipping like refills on tea and getting our check in a timely manner but tonight sealed the deal, NO MAS! It was my sons girlfriends birthday and we could have went any where else and been treated better than we did here! First of all my son didn't get what he ordered but ate it any way. His girlfriend was satisfied with what she got. I was satisfied with the supreme fajitas (lots of shrimp) my wife ordered the same and I was going to take her shrimp but she was only served a couple, and both of our beans were cold and not doubled, Fail! Then they ran out of tea for my wife's refill, so the waitress(owners niece) offered to bring something else to my wife since it was too late to brew more, w/o disclosing she was going to charge us for it (never assume!) I had already got a tea refill and unbeknownst to me she was charging us for tea refills (menu says free tea refills). Then the guitar man comes around and I usually brush him off but tonight felt good, we're celebrating, he finishes the song I'm gonna slip him a couple of bucks and he says it's 5 dollars! WTH, Applebee's would have sang to her for free! And she would have got a free dessert which comes next in my story, the family ordered a cheesecake just like we got last week welll they brought out some sort of tres leches cake and charged us the cheesecake price! They also charged us for one chips refill, cmon this ain't Boston where corn has to be flown in, no one charges for chips in Phoenix of all places! Well when we confronted the owners niece about the bills inconsistencies she resorted to lecture us that they always charge for tea / chip refills, that they haven't had the cheesecake in over two months when we explained we just had it last week! And showed disbelief that we didn't want to get charged for cheesecake instead of the tres leches Cake price. And that we should have expected  to  pay for the \"Jamaica\" water that my wife got instead of a tea refill. All in all it wasn't worth piddling over a few dollars from an owners niece perspective, we have told untold numbers of people about this place, one in particular, my daughters boyfriend from Columbia won't eat Mexican except for here! Well this place won't EVER see us again, like I said earlier, NO MAS!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this is the place. My favorite plate is the Molcajete, and the best part is that you get home made corn tortillas."}
{"text":"We live to come here with our family but we always knew the servers are gonna treat us like we owe them something... No matter how big the group is I bring... Love the food but I always think twice when I think if the service... Was there today for my bday...i won't celebrate here again"}
{"text":"I love this place, my parents really really love place this as well... We come here often & we always order the \"Molcajate\" it's too die for... Everything about the food here is really good except for the service is what they lack of & that's why I took one star away but the food is too die for IMO"}
{"text":"Great local Mexican place!!! The food is to die for - great value for portion sizes and everything is prepared fresh."}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab a bite to eat along with great live band! Thank I will be back highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is straight fuego! Everything is good, the prices are outstanding. I would almost argue that this is one of the best Sonoran style restaurant in PHX. This is the best find ever!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this small restaurant. Taste was authentic and prices were average. Easy parking and access. I ordered a soda and it was a can. They needed a fountain soda instead. The three carne asada tacos were good and filling while the convo plates were more than enough food. Loved the cheeses used but some items were different. Enchiladas looked like a flat taco. Cheese crisp was deep fried. I'd come back with a coupon."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come back for dinner since we were here exactly a year ago when we came here from Los Angeles California to see the Dodgers play. We are happy to say the we were very much satisfied with both the customer service and the food. My husband devoured his chicken mole enchiladas,  my daughter enjoyed her caldo de res and all though I didn't finish my molcajete; not because I didn't like it but because it was more than I could eat, I left full and satisfied. We also drank every drop of our Micheladas and my daughter loved her horchata.  All the waitresses were very friendly and welcoming.  We will definitely be back and make this a part of our annual trip to Arizona."}
{"text":"Oh...my.....GOD. This place kills every other Mexican resturant I have been to. And I have been told I'm the Mexican Resturant expert by only the top critics in the world. You can say I'm pretty achieved.  Enough about me. Right when you walk through the doors you feel apart of a cultured family. And the food.. the food is to die for. If marrying food was legalized, then I would already be in a 3 year marriage with the Molcajete. Unfaithfully, I would cheat with the Birria. Eventually both dishes would find out about my secret affair and I would leave them both. Thus, marrying the Suizas. And the waitresses are not friendly. They're family. They're always on the move, due to the resturant popularity, but still manage to ensure your food is ready and that you are well taken care of. You can tell the resturant is ran by a hardworking family that has morals, ethics, and a cute napkin roller boy. I would live here if I could!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!! But the service sucks they take you the food and forget about you so what ever you are drinking gotta make it oast thru your whole meal."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch, and found this to be like many other Mexican places in the valley - not bad, but nothing spectacular, and not really worth making a special trip to.  I ordered a steak chimi with rice. Both were decent, as were the chips and salsa. Nothing really jumped out at me.  I suppose it's a decent place, but I've been happier at some of the chains like Macayo's or Arriba."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. The corn tortillas are made fresh and the service is great.  The only thing this restaurant needs is an interior design makeover but other than that it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"We went in today for a Happy Hour / Cena with a Spanish Language Meetup group. We enjoyed an amazing event! The Happy Hour items & prices were fantastic! I've been eating Mexican food since 1954, and I grew up on Sonoran cuisine, The excellent appetizers and entrees were unlike any other restaurant I know, and the staff was so friendly, so this was a new experience. The Jaliscan specialties were all staggeringly excellent, and we shared so many plates of them! The shredded beef, house-made chorizo, and salsa were perfectly tasty & original. Shrimp wrapped in tocino? WOW! Some items were too salty. I got a birria burro to go for breakfast, and I'm confident it'll be the high point of my day! Our group unanimously agreed to come back here to sample the extensive menu. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Located on McDowell Road just off the highway, this restaurant has absolutely zero curb appeal. It is very unassuming, located in a dingy, uninteresting lot in central Phoenix.   So come without your assumptions and preconceptions.   La Barquita is a lovely neighborhood Mexican restaurant rooted in southern Mexican flavors and style. And you know that when the table tops have plastic covers, you are about to get some delicious treatment.   The menu carries breakfast, lunch and dinner options, including: huevos rancheros, huevos divorclados, chorizo, nopales, taquitos, flautas, sopes, quesadillas, chimichangas, mole, carnitas, steak picado, chile verde, camarones, 7 mares and so much more. Several large pages of options.   The restaurant is seemingly known primarily for its Molcajete a la Mexicana (a sort of Mexican stew) and its bírria, which is made with actual goat meat. Amazing flavor!   Food servings are ginormous. For $10-15, you will have enough to feed two adults. But you likely won't want to share a plate. The flavors are fresh with a lovely complexity and depth. That goes for the birria, enchiladas and beans.   Only dings: Yes, the mole was a bit more spice-forward than chocolate, but it was hearty and luscious. The queso con carne was very cheesy and bursting with flavor, but it did not hold well when we tried to reheat it at home later.   Other than that, great food, excellent service and a lovely time. Bonus: the space is large enough to cater to sizable parties, so bring your family and friends. But know that this place has no romance, so best not to go for a first, second or third date."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because we had an Entertainment coupon. The food was very good.... the service was so-so. When we went to pay, I showed the coupon with the app on my phone. The waitress said they didn't take coupons off the ohone, it would need to be printed. When. I questioned it, she said she'd be back. 10 mins later she was digging behind the hostess desk and finally came over and again said they wouldn't take them off phones. She said they used to have a sign, but they'd painted, so it had been removed (they did have all their other signs up... good reviews on Yelp, A Rating from the health inspector). I asked her if I could email it to the restaurant and they could print it? She refused.  Needless to say.... we won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had the molcajete Mexicano. Chicken, flank steak, chorizo, Cactus, unions, tomatoes, it's delixious. The sauce though....omg its so good. With Oaxaca cheese"}
{"text":"Almost gave a five star, but the service seemed to get worse and worse as the meal went on. Cozy, authentic Mexican restaurant with a large menu for anyone's taste buds! I ate the carne asada burrito and added guacamole and sour cream while my boyfriend had the cheese enchiladas. I would stray away from adding sour cream because it made the burrito a little too \"wet\"- totally my fault. The enchiladas come with cotija cheese rather than the Americanized version! I'd recommend getting your soda from the glass bottle rather than the can- so yummy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Phoenix. I usually get the molcajete with corn tortillas. The tortillas are freshly made, the food is great. Horchata is always good. If you go on a Sunday for lunch you may have to wait 20-30 minutes. The Diablo shrimp are always good too if you like spicy."}
{"text":"La Barquita is a small casual Mexican Restaurant that serves breakfast all day and many Mexican Favorites. The menu is quite long and from what we tried portions are very large and prices are low. This isn't a fancy place and is older and worn.  They started us off with delicious salsa that was served warm and a basket of chips.  My husband had what might be the signature dish the Molcajete. It was a bubbling cauldron of tasty flavorful sauce that was packed with tender flavorful carne asada, chicken, house made chorizo, cactus and chewy pieces of cheese. It came with house made refried beans, guacamole and house made tortillas. THIS WAS VERY GOOD.  GET THE MOCAJETE.....It was very good!   I picked the Fried Perch. The flesh of the fish was crunchy and it seemed like most of the flesh dissolved in the fryer. The fish was topped with mushrooms with maybe half a jar of what tasted like jarred crushed garlic and maybe a few handfuls of salt. Mushrooms were not edible. My plate also came with oil soaked lettuce, an unripe slice of tomato, porridge-like rice and oil soaked soggy fries. Nobody asked me how it was as they did the usual drop and run.  I would highly recommend to stay away from the fried perch.  I would go back since the Mocajete was great but I would stay away from the fried perch here."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast.  Solid, real-deal menudo - offered with or without a pata.  Great tortillas.  Machaca and eggs order was generous and tasty.  Good freebie chips.  Reasonable prices.  On food alone this place merits 4.5 stars.  But the barrio ambiance (panhandler in wheelchair parked out front - he took in more dough than the working waitresses earned in tips while we were there) and service (very friendly but slow/sloppy - unbussed tables, condiments for soup slow in coming out, etc).    This place nontheless is definitely going into our regular Sunday morning rotation.  I like the vibe emanating from both the patrons and staff here better than Rositas down the street..."}
{"text":"Gonna have to up this one star after my second visit.  Went back for lunch with one of my lunch Amigas and it was a good experience.  Salsa was yummalicious and the chips were warm, crunchy, and fresh.  The homemade tortillas were totally yummy.  I had the Carne Asada w/grilled shrimps.  Steak was thin and didn't have a lot of seasoning, but was T-E-N-D-E-R which is a rare find in a Mexican food place.  Most steaks are tough, and many of them have gristle.  Good to know this one is top-notch.  Beans were good, salad was decent, rice was fairly blah.  The one knock this time was service - again, like last time, the servers were slow to respond to an empty salsa bowl and an empty water glass.  Above average joint, but still not quite in the same class as Mariscos Playa Hermosa, which is my #1 Mexican Seafood stop in the PHX."}
{"text":"This is the very very best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Nothing compares.   Everything I have tried there has been perfectly prepared, fresh, and delicious.   The Molcajetes are to die for. I had the Molcajete de Camaron and my husband had the A La mexicans and we thought they were both delicious. My mouth was watering for my husband A La Mexicana just on the presentation alone. Great place."}
{"text":"SERIOUS MEXICAN NOM'S!!!  My husband and I stopped here after flying into Phoenix.  It was a bit late but they were more than willing to accommodate us, thank goodness!!!  I was craving good, real homemade Mexican food after being in the Midwest for months with no real Mexican.  This place seriously hit the spot.  Dive restaurant in not so good part of town...so what!! Trust me, you don't want to pass this place up.  The service is fast and friendly and the margaritas are seriously yummy BUT the MOLE is TO-DIE-FOR!!!  Seriously, I ate so much I'm pretty sure I almost died but the flavor of that mole was so incredibly rich and delectable that I could NOT stop eating.  It was by far the BEST MOLE I've ever had!  The other impressive part of their mole was that the chicken was served on the bone, almost stew style, which you don't see much.  Normally you order mole and it's either shredded or chunk white meat.  The bone-in chicken added to the richness of this dish.  I highly, highly recommend it!!!  Don't miss this place. You'll regret it! I shall return Barquita.  Te amo!!"}
{"text":"Food 5 stars. If you don't care much for service food is good and portions are generous.  Another con is that they have a restaurant.com coupon but they do not take it on the phone, they ask for it on paper (boo!)  Yaay! Keto/Lowcarb friendly Menudo. They have the option of menudo with or without hominy. With pata! (feet). We went there 3 times in the past few weeks and food is consistently good and service consistently slow. Honestly I tipped just because I do not know if it is because they are shorthanded and that would not be the servers fault. Since they have 2 separate rooms you don't see what is going on.  However, in the spirit of bad service, I saw here something I had never seen before.  Went there for lunch once and we took a table by the window that had not been cleaned yet. When I called this to the attention of our server, she cleaned only half. Only the half that was most dirty... I was like... whaaaaa? then she left and I asked a girl that was cleaning a neighboring table if I could borrow a rag... and she was really nice and came to clean our table the way you expected to be cleaned.   I stand by my previous review... service is slow and inconsistent. One of the servers is very nice and friendly, though.  About the food:  * Great menudo * Great shrimp cocktail (not very sweet, enough big shrimp) * Hubby had pork fajitas, they were delicious and the portion was huge (see my review about the wimpy fajitas for 2 at Salsa Brava in Flagstaff). Barquita's regular portion (for 1) was like twice the meat of the fajitas for 2 there.  * Churros are good, but extremely hot!!, please order them at the beginning of your meal. We thought we ordered them ahead of time this time but still they took forever and we ended up waiting for a while after we finished our meals.  Bottom line, I may come back if I am in the neighborhood and I am not very very hungry : )"}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is the only one in the Phoenix valley that has the authentic Mexican Jalisco taste. Like you are eating in my mommas kitchen and i am 100% mexican. My favorite is the Cocido de Res and the Chiles Rellenos. My husband loves the chicken fajitas. I love the corn tortillas they are made fresh to order and taste very good. The staff is very friendly. I always recommend this place to all my friends and family. Delicious Authentic Mexican Food!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and cold Michelada's. The grilled fish was very tasty and the Molcajete Camarons was spicy and flavourful."}
{"text":"Decent.  The carnitas were a bit fatty, but portions were grande."}
{"text":"Always recommend this place to my friends when they come to Arizona... good home made mexican food.."}
{"text":"I am impressed!! Hands down the BEST mexican food in the Valley!! The servers are very courteous and informative. They were more than happy to explain items on the menu that I could not understand. I would describe La Barquita as a family restaurant. It is quiet, friendly, and priced fairly on portions. OMG!! The Molcajetes a la mexicana is to die for!! I can't stop thinking about it. It includes a piece of grilled cactus. Never having cactus before, I never knew it was so yummy! What really makes me feel good about the restaurant is its employees. We were there on a Sunday. I saw the cook take time to sit down with his children and enjoy a family lunch together. I also saw a couple of children come in and give the waitress kisses and hugs. My enjoyable experience with food and atmosphere definitely makes me want to be a regular. YUMMO!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix visiting friends and catching the Springsteen show. We live in Austin and it's hard to find Mexican food there that isn't tex-mex influenced. Wanted to get some birria, so hard to find in most places and almost impossible in Texas. Did a good search, found this place. just took everyone and wow, this place is awesome.   I would absolutely go back if i lived out here, and would love to have this place in Austin.  We had the birria and the molcajete, just awesome.   If you like authentic mexican food and are fine with kind of a hole in the way type of atmosphere, this is your place. Try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"A few months ago, I was fortunate to be in the valley of the sun for a visit.   I live in this cold place up north now. I am cold and I complain about the temperature and the food.  La Barquita is the food that most represents what I miss the most in Arizona. Warm, unpretentious, inexpensive, honest and good.  In September I noticed that they painted the walls and got new linoleum and I thought back a few years before and remember Lupe dreaming about new linoleum, since the floor was stained by the previous owner. The new linoleum is a victory for all who love really good food.  Oh? And Rosita's? Someone I read actually wrote a review saying Rosita's was better? Are you high honey? Rosita's is a 3* uses store bought tortillas and microwaved a few of my taco plates too many. They have a big empty bar with a couple of coyote looking guys and one of my friends likes the shrimp tacos so I went there a few times but the microwave thing and the atmosphere are a bit rough. La Barquita is a MUCH better restaurant if you have taste buds or some understanding.  Where else in town can you get Huevos Divorciados or Birria or gordonoz fritz? This is the place.  I want a La Barquita  red chili pork plate! I can't get it here -they always make it with beef and only a few places I have discovered actually make tortillas from scratch, all of them a cold train ride away."}
{"text":"We had an Entertainment Book coupon and checked their ratings on yelp so we decided to give La Barquita a try. The place is a dive and was pretty much as expected after reading the reviews. It was clean and the servers were friendly and helpful. We decided to try the combos and that was a good choice. There was plenty of food and it was very fresh and cooked properly. The salsa was very flavorful but a bit mild so we asked for some hotter salsa. The waitress mixed some of the Habanera in with it and it was perfect. Their Chili Rellinos were some of the best I have had. Overall it was a nice meal and I would recommend their food to anyone just realize the place is very divey but overall enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place was horrible!! The food was bland and the margaritas were weak and tasted like orange juice. The service was also very poor. The waitresses were rude and neglected our table. If I could give this restaurant a 0 out of 5 I would!"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Mexican restaurant around, great food, great price and great atmosphere, fresh made corn tortilla just don't get floor tortillas but I love this place."}
{"text":"Want real Mexican food? Been coming here for three years because that's exactly what you're going to get. Decent service, amazingly no food, fair prices! I love it here and you will too!"}
{"text":"Ordered enchiladas with beans and rice, menudo, and grilled onions through Postmates. Enchiladas were cold and there was no beans or rice because they claimed I hadn't asked for it( but menu clearly states beans and rice). Onions were good as was menudo. I'm giving one star for poor customer service."}
{"text":"This place was simply great and delicious. It was more of a serendipitous find. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but this place definitely made me a believer!   I got the Mexican molcajete. I didn't know what it was but seeing the picture I had to get it! Boy was I right! It was so good! It's like a fajita cooked in a stone bowl with simmering salsa, adding extra flavoring to the meat. A MUST GET. my wife got the 7 mares soup. Also very good. A great portion of sweet shrimp, scallops, squid, zucchini, etc. a hearty bowl of soup with a delicious broth. Definitely would eat this when I'm sick,  were I to be that lucky.   --Keep eatin"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.   Been here before and the quality of food is great specially the hand made tortillas you get with your molcajete. Would have given them 5 stars if my water stayed full all the time and the wait to check out was shorter."}
{"text":"Mocajeta la mexicana was very good!  Their pico de gallo was by far the best I have ever eaten, extremely flavorful!  Excellent guacamole (made with the pico).  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"There is a good reason everyone else has raved about the molcajetes at this place.  It is probably the best dish to order here and is very good.  I wish they would have given me more tortillas though; I only had three, and it is a lot of food to eat.  You have to chop all the ingredients up yourself, but once you do that it is cool enough to eat after having come out sizzling hot to the table!  My family ordered various other plates and they didn't seem as jazzed as me about their selections.  My mom had the Pozole.  It was really good actually but the portion is HUGE, so make a meal out of it by itself.  My dad griped that his tacos dorados with shredded beef weren't deep fried like they do in all the taco shops in the the southwestern states.  At least they were a bit healthier this way.  I liked them.  The chips and salsa brought to the table were good.  I liked the salsa a lot - a nice spicy and smoky flavor.  The margaritas, however, left something to be desired.  They put way too much sweet and sour and triple sec.  Even at $3.50 I think I would just stick with a beer."}
{"text":"This was not my favorite.... in fact it wasn't even that good. Maybe it was the fajita veggies, maybe it was the sauce I didn't like. Bottom line this didn't work for me and I won't be going back. Too many good Mexican places in the area.  The servers were very nice. This is strictly two star huevos rancheros"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Family friendly. We get the chocomils and strawberry milks it's so delish!!! And enchiladas suzias are good! Pesole is good! Today I got something different and I loved it! I wish I could have finished it though. Only complaint here is they do take a while to make your food. I feel like it's a long wait."}
{"text":"I ordered basic  huervos rancheros with rice.  The entree was served with slices of meat which appeared to be ham(not sure) on it which I didn't care for, so I took it off. The entree was also topped with cooked slices of fresh mushrooms, green peppers and yellow peppers.  It was very good.   Everything seems to be homemade even the corn tortillas.   Service was excellent even though they got slammed right after I was seated.  There are two small dining rooms.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Love the flautas from here! They are so moist inside. The lunch specials are a great price at about $5! They have canned soda which I prefer! I hate paying 2.50 or 2.75 for a fountain drink when I usually only have one glass. Service is always good. The only thing I didn't like were the enchiladas. I was really disappointed. It seems like they took a soft corn tortilla put white cheese in it and put it in the microwave. They sprinkle a bit of white cheese on top that isn't melted. I prefer the usual enchilada with cheddar cheese baked and melted cheese."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for my love of good dive-y Mexican restaurants.   I went to La Barquita a few weeks ago on a Friday night at the tail end of Happy Hour. I have to say that La Barquita serves the largest and best $2 margarita I have ever had. I love to get tipsy for under a fiver. (It's $2, so don't expect top shelf or even middle shelf tequila. This is cheap tequila, but so is the drink. )  Service: Sweet and very nice ladies serve you and make sure you are enjoying yourself. Excellent service for a dive restaurant.  Food: Holy mole the food was great. I got the mole enchiladas with cheese. They were delicious. And some good rice and beans on the side. My friend ordered the molcajetes a la mexicana for one ($12). He loved it. He is a sucker for chorizo and he said it was cooked perfectly. He also loved the Mexican cheese, chicken, beef, and poblano peppers that completed the dish. The charro beans, fresh tortillas, guacamole, and rice were wonderful additions to the almost overwhelming amount of food.   My three favorite things about the meal were: 1) the chips and salsa -- great smoky flavor to the salsa with good, thick chips. 2) the guacamole -- I almost ate all of the side guac. It's chunky and seasoned just right. 3) the fresh tortillas -- I'm a a big fan of fresh tortillas. My best friend makes her own tortillas and I am sure that they are holy because they are so good. These tortillas were just as wonderful.  Go here for happy hour ($2 drinks) and good food."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it.    The salsa that came with the chips wasn't spicy, looked really good, but it was just tomatoey.    We had a place of steak and eggs, which the hubby said the eggs weren't all that well cooked and the steak was a thin piece of meat.  Also had a chorizo and egg plate.  The beans were good, but the chorizo was different because it had pico de gallo in it.  It was a big portion that we took leftovers since the kiddos weren't all that into it.  We also had the pozole.  The only thing I liked was the big portion of meat.  The broth was more watery than rich in flavor and the side fixins' were a bottle of tapatio, onion, cilantro and limes.  We were able to share.  The horchata was ok.  I wasn't impressed, but maybe dinner is better?"}
{"text":"We've been frequent flyers at La Barquita for awhile now... can't believe I haven't written a review earlier! Don't let the bars on the windows steer you away from stopping by! We're never disappointed by the authentic and relatively inexpensive food here. The complimentary red salsa is fresh and the perfect level of spicy. The molcajate is our favorite entrée- a bubbling hot salsa sauce packed with a variety of perfectly cooked meat. The service is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I've eaten  homemade Mexican food all my life. This is the real deal!! I feel like this place is a delicious little piece of Mexico on this side of the border. The only problem I've had (on more than one occasion) is they run out of key ingredients sometimes!! I ordered the molcajete and they didn't have nopales. I think on a previous visit they had run out of rice. That's pretty annoying when you go to eat a specific item from the menu and they've run out of it. Other than that, the service is good, the food is great, and the live music they have from time to time is superb."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place for sure. The tortillas were homemade that was the highlight that's why I'm giving two stars. My molcajete was ok except for the nasty chorizo it was beyond bad it had gone bad. The servers will literally drop your food and bail zero personality. When you ask for something they offer little or no response. Will not be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Small place in about 20 tables, very casual great Mexican food! My servers name was Lydia she was very Excellent!!  I tried on her suggestion the gold tacos, they were absolutely fabulous very tenders soft me and flavorful."}
{"text":"Was told that this was a great restaurant. I ordered the Chicken and Beef combo Fajitas. The plate was ok but the Beans and Rice were as cold like it came out of the Fridge. The beans were canned refried beans, My coffee was cold only got 1 Refill, I put the cup at the edge of the table for refills that never came. My Family will eat there again."}
{"text":"Great food! Authentic Mexican!  Been 3-4 times, always very delicious. Chips and salsa are great. Been for  breakfast  and got Chiaquiles... That's what brought us back."}
{"text":"Trying out some new styles of Mexican food is always a treat! While La Barquita has a gigantic menu with dozens and dozens of items, I just had to try *the* item everyone raves about.   Molcajete - La Mexicana   Even for one, this is an incredibly filling dish that felt like a multi-course meal. First we've got a sizzling-hot stone bowl filled with a small steak, chicken breast, grilled nopales (that's cactus), chorizo, and queso fresco.  On the side, you'll have a bowl of guac, beans with cotija, and 5 tortillas of your choice. Please pick corn with this one, or I'll be very disappointed!   Enjoy it how you want. After 5 DIY tacos I was stuffed, took the leftovers home and enjoyed the smoky, citrus-y cactus for breakfast.   There are other varieties of this stellar dish, including a seafood option. Otherwise, there's a more recognizable southwestern menu with some American items as well. A very safe choice for unadventurous diners in your entourage. Don't overlook it!"}
{"text":"Not sure what was wrong with me, I noticed that I gave La Barquita a three star.  I apologize for such a low review.  There rice is great, and the food is nothing but quality.  I get the soup, I suggest for those colder days or sick days to try it out.  I\"m glad so many other people tried this Mexican restaurant its not an easy place to find."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars. It's clean, service is excellent, food is amazing! Tortillas made fresh! You get a lot of food for your money. They were even kind enough to allow my in laws to order their food after they had closed their kitchen for the night. Ever since we found out about it we've been telling others about it. It's not everyday I find a Mexican restaurant I like."}
{"text":"This place is located right next to Jack n the box and if you don't pay quick attention, because of how close it is to the intersection, you may pass it. Inside it is cozy, a little dusting is over due. They have happy hour and make good drinks, like my drink here on this pic. Worth a try."}
{"text":"So disappointing. After fantasizing about a Friday night dinner out ALL DAY, we decided to try this local dive. We had previously been to Rosita's place down the street and wondered how two Mexican restaurants could compete so close to each other.   Well, I'm still wondring. Rosita's Place was excellent. La Barquita was so mediocre that I spent the entire next day fantasizing about where to go out on Saturday to quell my unsated desire to have a good meal at a restaurant.  We got there at 8 on Friday. Hours are listed as open until 9. We were the ONLY people in the place other than the lone waitress, one cook, and two old dudes playing guitar. They approached us at one point and asked us if we wanted a song (man, I HATE that--but no big deal, it's a dive.), and we politely declined.    No one greeted us when we walked in, I had to go back to the kitchen to see if they were really open.  The waitress was very friendly and service was prompt, once we were noticed.   We ordered the posole, queso fundido with chorizo, 3 sopes with steak, and a chicken burro with red sauce.   It was all *okay*, nothing to write home about.   The queso was literally a dish of broiled cheese with crumbled chorizo, which, as soon as it came out of the oven, started to congeal and we actually had to cut it with a knife.  I had to ask for more salsa because the shot-glass portion that came with our chips was gone in uno minuto. It was tasty salsa, though.  About halfway through our meal, the waitress started mopping the floor of the restaurant with very potent disinfectant. I could practically taste it, and she was actually mopping around our feet! Nothing says \"hurry up and get out\" like the scent of bleach in your food...  She followed us to the door after we paid and, as I predicted, locked that sucker the second we stepped out. 8:30pm.   Well, now I don't have to wonder about this place and I can keep going to Rosita's..."}
{"text":"Read about this place serving a great Mexican breakfast and it lived up to its billing. The Mrs ordered Huevos Divorciados which I haven't seen outside Mexico. It was killer. I had the Chilaquiles (very good) and the nipper had Pancakes, which didn't look like much but were delicious. Excellent homemade corn tortillas proved that the place is most certainly legit, and all at very cheap prices. It was only 10am, so it was an hour or two early for me, but the vibey surroundings made me want to start necking beers, cranking the mariachi tunes and watch the footy."}
{"text":"La Barquita is THE BEST Mexican food I have had... EVER!  I ordered the Chile Verde and Horchata.  Here's the deal folks, you know you are in for an amazing experience when the waitress tells you \"I just made the corn tortillas this morning... they are fresh\".  If you want an Americanized Mexican food encounter, then pull up a chair at Macayo's or Rosita's and drive right past La Barquita.  I look forward to seeing some other folks chime in on this one!  A real local, hand made, mouthwatering time.  PS $3.50 Margaritas all the time... $2.00 during happy hour.  Beat that Rosita!!"}
{"text":"If i could give this plave a zero i would.  This place does Not care aboit the quality  of food they serve costumers.  I order hamburger for my daughters and they were burn . They serve my daughters  just bread tje beef patty and fries. I order the enchiladas.. and insted of drowning  in sause. They were drowning in some discusting iol. I will never go back to this place.. and i dont recommended  to anyone."}
{"text":"The Menudo is good. Needs a little more meat & a meaty pigs feet, but overall very good! The pozole was good also needs more meat less bones. Still great flavor! Service was ok didn't see my waitress all the time. But worth the $5 tip Great homemade corn tortillas AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!  We been there 2 times already in the past 48 hours.  Menudo, Mole Enchiladas, and Huevos con Chorizo so good and flavorful.  From outside it's not to inviting but once you're inside they make you feel comfortable. We will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Chips and Salsa Refried Beans and Guacamole Birria with handmade Corn Tortillas Shrimp Ceviche Tostada Chicken Mole with Beans and Rice Molcajete with Elote, Chicken, Beef, Pork, Peppers, Green Onions, Ranchero Cheese Cinnamon Churro, Cream Churro  Small, family owned and completely \"authentic\" per trusted sources, La Barquita Restaurant on East McDowell Road played host to New Years Day brunch for a group of three, the \"Help Wanted\" signs posted both indoors and out pointing to service issues that would be experienced in terms of drink refills and dirty piles of plates left to languish on nearby tables, though the food brought forth from the kitchen was across-the-board great.  Best described as unassuming, the low-slung and festively decorated space widely considered a hangout for nearby immigrants of southern Mexico, it was at a sturdy four-top in direct view of a television showing NFL action that the group was seated, several \"signatures\" pointed out by menu pictures from a list entailing everything from Goat to Hamburgers, thus ensuring a \"safe for all tastes and ages\" sort of approach.  Focused on old family recipes, the plating and service assuredly secondary to flavor, it is with a bowl of small, warm Chips alongside mild Salsa that patrons are greeted, the Horchata in a big cup sweeter than many versions, but nonetheless handy for quelling the heat if one decides to ask for some of the La Barquita's spicier stuff.  Owned by Jose Garcia, a Native of Jalisco who came to The Valley by way of Los Angeles, a meal at La Barquita is best experienced as a large group willing to partake family-style with a sense of adventure, a crisp Corn Tortilla topped in U-30 Shrimp and diced Tomatoes proving light and vibrant with Cilantro and Avocado while the steaming plate of Birria presented classic Goat Stew complete with bones and ready to be loaded onto handmade Corn Tortillas topped with Lime, Onions, Refried Beans, Guacamole or intense housemade Hot Sauce.  Waiting briefly for the second part of the order, a two o'clock arrival at \"the little boat\" still finding the place packed with families speaking in Spanish, round two offered a half-chicken mostly deboned beneath a dark blanket of semi-sweet Mole, the earthy notes not meeting approval from a typically adventurous nine-year-old, but well suited for sharing amongst fans with a craving while the three-legged stone bowl offered a treasure trove of textures and flavors including paddles of Cactus, three types of Meat and squeaky grilled Cheese in a smoky sauce comprised of Serrano and Poblano Peppers plus Garlic and Tomatoes.  Not reinventing the wheel with dessert, though no Tres Leches is to be found, a sweet finish was served in the form of two Churros, the Vanilla Cream-filled version light, crisp and tasty while the eighteen inch rod of Cinnamon, Sugar and Dough was almost completely soaked through from too much time in the oil, a lone misstep from a place now in business for over a decade turning out delicious and affordable plates of authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, based on flavor.  Mexican food, authentic Mexican food, with amazing flavor.  Their fajitas are flavorful (nothing compared to Chili's), and they come with a side of beans, rice, guac, sour cream, and tortillas. Perfect portion, you might even have left overs.  Their enchiladas are great, authentic, not the regular Americanized enchiladas full of melted cheese; these have flavor, sauce, chicken, and the perfect amount of cheese.  Their caldos are flavorful, good portion as well.   Their Mexican Molcajete is delicious! If you get it for 2 people, you will both be satisfied (unless you eat a lot); it includes: carne asada, pollo asado, chorizo, nopales, and a delicious sauce. It is not like fajitas, it's all separated, but it comes with a side of beans, guac, and tortillas, individually served for the 2 people. It is BOMB!  The service is great, bilingual staff, very friendly, really quick.  The place is very small, but it's cozy, I can see how some people may find it a little claustrophobic thou. There's enough free parking as well, so nothing to worry about there.  One of my favorite Mexican spots in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Delicious hole in the wall! Authentic through and through!!! Try the carne asada quesadilla, enchilada suizas or the chile relleno"}

{"text":"Well deserved. Delicious food. The chips were crunchy. Salsa was super fresh. Shrimp ceviche was generous and tasty. And the meals, wow."}
{"text":"Normally, the service is better on slower days but they try hard, owner got involved to make service quicker."}
{"text":"I was there for a lat lunch, so after the lunch and before the dinner crowd. Very few tables were occupied, but we still had to ask for a second glass of drink after waiting  at least 25 minutes and watching the waitress pass our table many times. But the food made up for the slow service. Chili relleno plate had a relleno, taquito and sope and very tasty. The sope was a fun surprise as I had never had one prepared this way and it was good. The taquito has a lot of meat stuffed in it and the relleno had a light egg batter, but the chili was nice and spicy. My husband had the shredded beef chimichanga. I tasted the meat and it was moist and flavorful."}
{"text":"We had a marvelous lunch of seafood tostado grande and grilled salmon with mushroom and garlic sauce.  It was as good as it gets!  Iced tea, cold beer with lime in a salt-rimmed mug --what else is there in life!?! Yes, it is a divey neighborhood joint.  But the attentive service makes up for the \"comfy\" decor."}

{"text":"Good Stuff... thick handmade corn tortillas, tasty salsa, $2 Coronas, friendly service. things started out pretty good.. and quickly got better I ordered a Molcajete. chicken, carne asada, chorizo, nopal (cactus) grilled then served in a hot stone bowl with salsa, guacamole, beans, and tortillas A lot of food, a lot of flavor...  I can't wait to try the Mole. it looked fantastic heading to another table Worth a look"}
{"text":"great food...definitely going back....sort of dirty(maybe a bit short handed)....the goat birria was great and the Mojolete too"}
{"text":"Zero stars had the worst experience had the waitress be rude, demanding, & pushy. I was told to switch seats & to hurry up & order to pick something quick! When i go to a restaurant im paying for good food & friendly accommidating service. I want to be able to sit down especially if the whole place is empty wherever i feel comfortable. I want to enjoy my time in peace let it be relaxing just serve me whith a smile is that too much to ask."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the low key atmosphere of the place...it's like being in Mexico.  Everybody is very relaxed, even when there's only 1-2 servers and they only walk around once every 10 minutes.  But they are very nice. I'm glad to have found a mexican restaurant with other items from Mexican cuisine you don't often find.  Mole, Birria...and I didn't try any, but the seafood dishes looked amazing.  It's a bit far from my neighborhood, and not too close to work either, but next time I have to go to PHX I'm definitely stopping here again."}
