{"text":"This taste like plastic!!  Just too pricy for the terrible taste. Plus one of the lady was rude to me. I didn't want any rice or noodles with my food but she insisted. She still put rice on it even when I  said I didn't want. 

I'd give a negative star if possible. 

Trust me, you're better of saving your cash and getting ruby Thai ( I always get ruby Thai. Something must have possessed me to deviate today) or a&w 

Just a waste really."}
{"text":"Avoid, avoid, avoid. There are about a hundred options in the area with better food, prices, and service. Not sure if the servers at this place are in a competition to see who can treat customers the worst. Like the poster below me, I would also give them a negative star if I could. YUCK."}
{"text":"I totally agree with Ann R. I also went to the Square one location. I come here a least twice a week.  Bad service. The service is horrible. I come to this place a least a couple of times a week. Today the cashier, (its usually this one).  I'm not going to say her name but it begins with a J.  She is really rude. She treats people who are Cantonese speaking in a very disrespectfully.  I see her treat Caucasian customers and theirs who speak mandarin extra nice. I seen this myself and with a friend of mine who spoke mandarin to her and there is a big difference.Today was the worst with her she deliberately severed someone else before me even though I was ahead of them in line. The service is bad with most of the other staff too One star I wish I could give no stars."}
{"text":"Just had the lady at the cash tell me \"you have to learn to tell me how you want to pay\"  this happened without her even asking me.  Needless to say my first experience with this place was not very good.  Food was mediocre also but after an experience like that i can barely be impartial."}
{"text":"I loved there Singapore noodles and the shrimps were best!!!! and also loved therte eggplant dish it tasted awesome than other place like ruby thai etc. overall had great experience tasting there food !!! :)"}
{"text":"I will preface this review first by saying I am by no means a dumpling nor dim sum expert. I have had my fair share of dim sum and it all seems to taste about the same to me. I have yet to have my mind blown by any particular franchise or restaurant. 

This place had a decent selection (sesame balls, BBQ pork buns, chicken & vegetable, pan fried dumplings, shrimp har gow, pork siu mai). I selected their 8pc option for approximately $10.00 before tax. Is that a rip off in Toronto? I don't know yet as I have not ventured into Chinatown. It was, however, the only option for dim sum at the mall and I wanted dim sum. So I bought it and ate it and I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Delicious fast food at the Eaton Centre's urban eatery. Singapore Noodles + Tofu were both excellent and for about $8.50! Yum :)"}
