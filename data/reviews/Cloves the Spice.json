{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious. Everything was fragrant and well spiced. The veggie pakoras were amazing; melt in your mouth good. Such a great addition to the neighbourhood. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"My friend's review:  \"We had dinner there last night; I had Lamb Jalfrezi and my friend had the Eggplant Bharta. We sampled each other's dishes and were in complete agreement that the food was absolutely amazing.  The place's unglamorous decor might not impress everyone, but as far as I'm concerned, the food quality, which is much more important in my opinion, is simply superb.  It's a shame that Cloves The Spice is often less than half-full while a few of the less-deserving establishments nearby are more crowded. I'm sure that'll change as more people discover this underappreciated gem.\""}
{"text":"Just ate there. Not good. The mixed vegetable curry, which was recommended by our server was good. The pakoras seemed microwaved but were okay.  The nan was okay-was it freshly baked? Another dish we tried was of course the obligatory butter chicken, it was very disappointing.  It was very sweet (a reoccurring central Toronto problem) and bland.  Honestly, I don't know what was worse, the disappointing butter chicken or the fact we found a hair in the pakoras and the papadum.  They compt the pakora-we didn't mention the papadum."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.. They gave me  2 hour delivery time. Received my food ice cold and they Indian cuisine I received.....2 stars is generous. Banjara on Bloor kicks ass!!!"}
{"text":"My favourite Indian take-out restaurant! Probably the best in midtown TO. I've ordered delivery from here about 4 times and the food is consistently great. Everything on the menu is so flavourful. I love the vindaloo... it's actually spicy! The vegetarian dishes are delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this place out a couple of months ago when i received a discount through an online ordering site and it has been my go to for Indian ever since! The food is delicious and always fresh. Great quality at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I tried this place yesterday night, the restaurant it self looks nice inside however it was empty at about 7.  I orded take out, got the butter chicken and lamb saag.  The butter chicken was pretty standard, nothing special and lamb saag was awful.  It had no flavor and no spice.  The naan seemed like it was cooked in a pan then microwaved, very soft and flat.  It should be fluffy.    Overall if you aren't use to indian food, this place would be fine, but if you are like me and love flavorful spicy indian food, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food, considering there were only a couple of tables when we came in.  Nice clean & quiet atmosphere, and smelled nice inside (if it doesn't, we usually walk out right away!)  Being a Vegan, we are always trying new Indian restaurants, noticed a new one at this location, and considering it's pretty close to home, we will definitely come back. One of the best Chana Masalas we've tasted, and definitely the best Biryani!! Deliciously hot Naan bread, and Pappadums with REAL lentil flour. They really understood what \"Vegan\" means & not all Indian restaurants do. Food came hot and fast, and price very reasonable.  Hope they stay, because they are leaps and bounds better than the previous 2 Indian restaurants in this exact spot."}
{"text":"The food here is good - not the best - but good.  I made the mistake of actually going to the restaurant for a sit-down meal and quickly realized that this is primarily a take-out/delivery spot.  On a Friday night, not a single other table was in the place and for good reason.  The ambience wasn't particularly comfortable or attractive, however our server was nice enough.    We had the standard butter chicken along with the lamb jal frezi which is a dish I've never tried before.  The butter chicken was alright - huge chunks of chicken (almost too big) with plenty of sauce.  The sauce, however, was not quite as flavourful as others I've tried.  The lamb jal frezi was pretty good.  The sauce had a lot of flavour and just enough spice for me (I got it in medium and I can handle a bit of spice) and was very meaty as well.  One downside for me was the huge chunks of green bell pepper and onion that weren't quite sauteed enough for my liking.  They were a little too crisp for a stew-type dish and detracted from the meal a bit.  The place wasn't particularly cheap for being a mostly take-out spot.  A dinner for 2 came to approximately $50 with no beverages and a samosa appetizer.  The bottom line:  I would order take-out from here again due to the lack of good indian restaurants in the area, but I have had better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Used to be good a long time back. Now it's a disgrace to Indian cuisine. Except for a semi-decent butter chicken other dishes don't even resemble what they are supposed to be. Especially roganjosh...which they've turned into horrible a chunky tomato based gravy.  To add to the misery, staff is rude and arrogant. A manger less and ownerless establishment where inmates seem to be running the asylum."}
{"text":"The Tandoori Platter was delicious!  I'm going to write a review that might change after going to the place.   I was in one of those \"boring home sick afternoons\", in where you want to do something, but you can't go out. So I decided to treat myself with a delicious delivery dinner.  I opened the just eat site, and started to analyze the ethnicity of the restaurants that deliver. I didn't want the typical Chinese or pizza options, so I was really pleased to see an Indian restaurant within the list and neighborhood.  I ordered the mixed Tandoori Platter, Goat on some kind of black sauce, and lentils.  My favorite dish was the Tandoori Platter. It had shrimp, chicken, cheese and a salad. The flavor and texture were perfect, so as the amount of food.  The goat kind of disappointed me, not because of the sauce, but cuz it was chewy and clearly undercooked.  The lentils were ok. But I wouldn't order them again, cuz the flavor was too strong and I was burping them during one hour.  The delivery took a while, so order an hour before getting hungry.  I'm going to give another chance to the place, but this time I will go there."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, i really did.  i had been looking forward to trying it for a while now since i love indian food and this place would be close to get to.  Unfortunately it was an overall disappointment. The Butter Lamb was a nice twist but nothing special and there was a LOT more sauce than meat in the take out container.  The Vegetable Pakoras were good, nice and crispy with a good mix of vegetables to batter and not greasy at all but.... they managed to omit the tamarind chutney from my order sadly.  Worst of all was that the naan was still half raw, might try cooking the other half and see if it ends up edible but... not holding my breath. Won't be back and hunt for a go-to indian place continues."}
{"text":"First take out order here tonight, via UberEats. Ordered Butter Chicken, Eggplant Bharta, Palak Paneer, naan.  The Good:  -Portion sizes are enormous! Overflowingly full, full-size take out containers (see photo) -Eggplant Bharta is delicious - so flavourful and not too chunky, as I like it -Palak Paneer is also fantastic - sufficient paneer, and the dish still tastes like actual spinach (which I don't find everywhere) -the chicken in the Butter Chicken is moist and flavourful  The Not So Good: -the Butter Chicken sauce tastes like Campbell's creamy tomato soup - thankfully that's a soup I like, but certainly not how Butter Chicken should taste  -the Naan was flat like a pancake and very doughy - it was like an undercooked roti, not the light, fluffy bread I was craving tonight - so disappointing! Hopefully it was just an off night for the naan maker? (see photo)"}
{"text":"Dropped in yesterday on a whim just casually looking for a place to eat.  I loved the atmosphere when you walk in.  They've gone all out to renovate the space.  The owner served us as we were the first customers there, ever.  I didn't think this could happen lol.  Anyway, the food was delicious, they were generous with their wine portions and they even threw in some starters \"on the house\".    Overall, love the restaurant, love the food, will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is my go to take out place. Great vegetarian and vegan options. Delicious!!! I've only eaten in once. It's not a fancy place, very basic and simple but OK. I'm sad they are closed on Tuesdays!! Nothing more to say."}
{"text":"My favorite for take out. Skip the butter chicken and get the Vindaloo, its amazing. The service is always friendly."}
