{"text":"The first time I saw the place, I was quite impressed and amused by the place. you have very good alcohols there, but they're a bit pricey. The thing that bothered me was the absence of people in the bar... it's a bit depressing when you find yourself in a bar where there's only 3-4 persons. It does have potential though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, skinny doormen with hilarious curly moustaches, expensive drinks; fantastic decor.  My favourite bar in Montreal.  Waiting for a place to sit down is actually not too bad, if you show up with a small group.  It's a great time to meet new people - much better than a noisy dancefloor.  The interesting seating arrangement allows for easy conversation, though I would not recommend coming here with more than 3-4 people during the busy hours - it's hard to look good while standing up, when everyone else is sitting."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite comfort restaurants in downtown Montreal! Why? It's open from 11am until 3am! Hurray for late night eats!! Even though they're open until wee hours, the quality of their food is very consistent and yummy every time.  They do classic Japanese eats like ramen but also have cool street eats of Japan that are very tasty. I've never had a miss from their menu which is really rare (and trust me, I've tried a lot :D). From their appetizers, main dishes, to dessert, every single one of them seem to be almost perfect on my palate. I definitely recommend their desserts and milkshakes as they're really refreshing and creative!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Montreal for the day and stumbled upon Big in Japan.  Neither of us were particularly hungry but wanted a small snack. We came right at the end of lunch and were told we can order from the lunch menu or the dinner menu if we waited 20 more minutes.  We stuck with the lunch menu, but the dishes were all rather big. I did not see any appetizers on the menu.  Also the menu is not very big or anything that resembles a Japanese restaurant in then Western world.   We decided on splitting the cold ramen noodle salad. It was huge- two of us stuffed ourselves in order to finish it.   The dish itself was rather pretty upon presentation .. Full of color, soft and crunchy ingredients. The dish was tasty.  However, the sauce, that was a big part in the dish was way too salty.   The atmosphere in here felt a bit strange. I could not pinpoint why, either way, our waitress was very nice and attentive ( we were 2 out 4 people in there) and she also spoke English very well.   I hope to get back there to try more and update the review."}
{"text":"Il y a de quoi plaire à presque tous les portefeuilles, chez Big In Japan. Je parle de prix avant tout, car à première vue, les repas y semblent dispendieux. Cependant, il y d'excellents sandwichs et soupes sous la barre des 10$, et les portions sont généreuses.  Côté nourriture maintenant, si votre palais est un peu aventureux, cet endroit est parfait pour vous!  Beaucoup de mets à base de poisson, cari, et sésame, c'est le meilleur du Japon, sans trop tomber dans la parodie américaine.  Deux mentions spéciales: les desserts (chers, mais très goûteux), et les heures d'ouverture (on peut y manger jusqu'au milieu de la nuit - rare pour les restos de ce calibre).  Finalement, il est à noter que le menu y semble en constante évolution. C'est bien pour essayer des nouveaux plats, mais ça peut être un tantinet décevant lorsqu'un mets spécifique que l'on désire n'est plus servi.  Somme toute, Délicieux!"}
{"text":"Locale carino e grande aperto anche nel pomeriggio. Abbiamo preso il Ramen ed è buono. Aggiunta di birra locale buona. Tutto a buon prezzo rispetto alla norma. Personale gentile ed educato. Consiglio."}
{"text":"Locale carino aperto anche di pomeriggio. Prezzi contenuti e birra locale ad un ottimo prezzo. Cibo di media qualità, ma considerato che siamo a Montreal possiamo considerarlo anche discreto. Personale gentile e paziente."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this bar and my first impression was I found the staff pushy. They kept on coming up to check my drink every two minutes. I was told it was laid back atmosphere and it was far from it. I waited 20 minutes for my bill. I followed it up and was surprised how rude the manger Andre was. He actually told me rudely to have some patience. He even went as far as to scream at me that I'm never allowed back. Try somewhere else. I have to rate it one star but from my experience it was a zero."}
{"text":"Never go there. While waiting for a table the manager was berating staff in front of us so we should have known what we were in for. Had the pork buns, they were fine. Very mediocre. Then came the tuna tartare with rice. It looked like canned tuna but tasted worse. As fishy as anything I've ever had and I've eaten raw fish all over the world. I told the waitress it was terrible and asked for it to be replaced with fried chicken. No chance I would order any seafood again. First time in my life I'd ever sent back food in a restaurant. She said sure but returned shortly after to tell us they would not take it back but we could take it to go!!! I asked for the manager who fought with us before walking away. He refused to change the bill. We left but did NOT pay the full amount. NEVER EVER GO THERE."}
{"text":"Having just returned from Japan, I came to here to compare. I didn't expect much but was keen to relive some Japanese dishes. Service was really slow. Staff were nice. Food was \"okay\"."}
{"text":"BOOOOOOO!!!   What is it with whiskey bars...is it some kind of rule that they all have to act like pricks?   The doorman was very friendly and polite, and we found ourselves seated after about 10 minutes of standing outside the unidentified door on the street.  Upon entering, I was pleased with the trendy decor and intimacy of the place.  The glass bartops look like a maze, and it's a very chic, romantic vibe.    The problem started with the waiter.  When we sat down on the tiny stools at the bar, I found that there was nowhere to put our belongings.  Other customers were putting their purses and coats on the floor, but I had a small purse so I put it on the counter.  The waiter immediately told me to move my bag to the floor in a cold manner.    Strike 1.  The menu was very sparse as far as beer and cocktails go, but this is a specialty whiskey place, so I let that go.  Still, it was a bit pretentious for the price and selection.   Strike 2. We waited a good while for our plain and simple drinks to come  BIG Strike 3. When we finally did receive them, the waiter dropped the check and then actually forced us to pay before we had even finished our drinks.    It seems like they just want to churn people out rather than give them a good experience.  Because of this, I left a tip for the bad service that even I'm ashamed of giving.  Whatever, he deserved it.  Super overrated."}
{"text":"love everything abou the place minus the fact that cocktails should be better and the food wayyy better! but great other assets. good for date"}
{"text":"Great ambiance with a lounge feel (minus the ow seating): Moderately busy in a weeknight. Inside you find dim lighting, exposed brick, and swivel chairs that are arranged in pairs, which make it a better place for a date and conversation than a loud night out with a group of friends. Wished I could hear more jazz and/or downtempo rather than the rock that was playing that night.   Interesting and tasty cocktails, but limited selection, and overeager waitresses that return over and over again to check in with you. And the drinks taste slightly different each time you order them. No student prices here, get ready to spend at leaf $50 for three drinks."}
{"text":"Place looks cool as you walk in and you don't see past the curtains in the back where they keep the more desperate patrons that just wanna be there so they can say they were there.  But give me an efin break with your non sense concept of having to walk around the maze to find a seat.  I'm from Toronto so if I wanted pretentiousness I would not have stayed somewhere douche at home.    They got this place all wrong from concept to staff.  All the positive reviews in blogs etc are due to heavy marketing.   Sure I would have liked to have gotten a seat with no issues and sit in one of the cool seats up front and all would have been easy.  But my experience was different and difficult.  Not what I want for a place just to get a drink.  We literally Walked around the place looks for a spot to sit (after waiting for 10 mins to get in), didn't and walked back out   So we went to majestique down a block and had a great time.  But that's a separate review.  Hope this helps"}
{"text":"It was an interesting concept and beautiful place.  Drinks are delicious here I had a Pimm's Cup, probably the best Pimm's I've ever had.  The service is really good everyone was kind and helpful.  I just thought that there should be a section of the place that could be more of an open concept.  So there can be room if you wanted to stand and have a drink with some friends while waiting for a seat.  It felt like rush hour in the metro.  I felt half the people that go there seem nice and down to earth and the other half are stuck up or douche bags.  So it's a place where you can enjoy the company of other strangers but also want to punch a douche bag in the face.  My final thought of the place would be when I come back it will be much earlier in the evening before the crowd shows up so I can enjoy a drink or two with friends and not feel claustrophobic."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bar ever! Unique interior design with Japanese whiskey bottles hanging from the ceiling that runs across the middle of the bar. Ambience was definitely on point and the candles on the tables added a romantic touch to the whole tranquil atmosphere. Service was excellent and they were able to provide good recommendations according to your taste for alcohol. Had the Rhum Sour which was well balanced in terms of the sweetness, sourness and the rum which was an absolutely wonderful concoction. Overall, an impressive place that is worth the wait. It is truly an experience!"}
{"text":"Hidden bar but very nice ambiance! Drinks were mixed well. Menu included a decent variety of whiskers and cocktails. Very romantic. Service was great."}
{"text":"Lovely bar, tasty drinks, excellent music. Pretty pricey compared to the usual bars - for me it's for special occasions only. But the drinks are pretty powerful as well, so there's that. Overall I've found the staff extremely professional. The atmosphere in of itself makes it worth visiting."}
{"text":"Food: I wouldn't call it \"authentic\" Japanese, rather the menu seems more fusion to me but with Japanese influences, with some interesting choices. The servings are big and the food is excellent in terms of taste.   Service: Fast despite the large crowd  Price: reasonable  Ambiance: relax lounge style, with a hipster twister."}
{"text":"Beautiful, beautiful little hidden gem... very romantic and lit with candles, but also great for gossip chat with a close friend. Perfect for a dirty martini on a Thursday or Friday night."}
{"text":"I love Japanese food and although a lot of Japanese restaurants / izakayas have been popping up in Montreal lately, Big In Japan has been around the block for quite some time. Always a good experience in my opinion. Check out my review to find out more: http://delifeed.ca/2015/08/06/big-in-japan-japanese-tavern/"}
{"text":"Awesome vibe. Very different from usual bars. It's got a Great Gatsby sorta feel. Classy drinks. Great for a date. You have to sit along the bar so you have to turn your back to someone in order to talk to someone else."}
{"text":"Nice decor, when the boyfriend and I stepped into the restaurant/bar, we felt like we were in Marugame, Japan. It gave us the feeling of a small town Japanese town. The waitresses were extremely friendly, telling us about the daily special and although alcohol must be accompanied by a meal, they told us that we could split the $27 daily special.  We ordered: -Green tea smoothie -Red bean smoothie -Miso Katsu don -Gyoza  Of the two smoothies (which were excellent by the way), we were both a fan of the matcha smoothie, it was tasty. Not too sweet, and had a distinct matcha taste. The red bean was a bit too milky for our taste. The gyoza was a fusion of some sort, they were deep fried, but the filling was the normal gyoza pork filling. The miso katsu don was great! I loved the moist rice, the sweetness of the rice complimented the crunchiness of the pork cutlets. All in all, it was a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I've experienced better.. I had high expectation seeing the reviews at first. When I came in, it look like a cheap dine in. Is it the end of the world ? no. I order a Beef Kinda soup with ramen. Oh. My. God. It was spicy as ####. And unfortunatly, not the good ''oh my god''. The kind that everything that you put in your mouth is just ''OK''. I think there is better restaurant in MTL to spend that 16$"}
{"text":"The worst! 9 hours to get a friggin beer. Cool deco but full of losers"}
{"text":"Big in Japan Bar - hidden cocktail spot with amazing drinks, intimate and upscale ambiance, great date spot, and charming and unobtrusive service  This cocktail lounge is hard to find with no visible signs outside, but worth it for the amazing drinks and unique atmosphere. To find it, look out for the black door with graffiti next to Patati Patata.  Once you enter, you will walk through a narrow corridor and be greeted by the rows of candles lining the table top. The long wooden bar snakes around the room, and branches out in different sections, creating privacy between groups. Bottles of whiskey hanging from the ceiling add to the unique decor. For you whiskey connoisseurs, you can buy your own bottle of Japanese whiskey, leave it at the bar where they will safely attach it to the ceiling until your next visit!   Drinks: great selection of gin and rum based cocktails, along with sakes, wine and umeshu Ambiance: intimate and upscale Who to bring: a special someone or a small group of friends Service: Attentive but unobtrusive Price: average $10-15 for a cocktail"}
{"text":"Le service est très bon! Les drinks sont dispendieux mais vous en avez pour votre argent. Atmosphere Chaleureuse, idéal pour une soirée de couple."}
{"text":"Very disappointing service so-so, food more than average."}
{"text":"Nice place to go have some drinks with friends. Service is really nice and ambiance is great, I especially liked the design of the booth area. You can also buy a bottle of whiskey and drink it with a group of friends or I believe have them hold it (although not too sure how that works).  Would recommend for afterwork drinks, evening get together with friends or first date."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever. I come here atleast 3 times a month.. the staff is great the music is phenomenal , so old school I love it. The food is just simply amazing! We always order the same thing the mushi pan , age gyoza , crispy pork on rice & chicken wings! I love itttttt"}
{"text":"The other reviews have this place more or less pegged right; the food is not bad, but it's mostly fried, specials are a bit too expensive, it's perhaps as much western as it is Japanese, and the service is disinterested at best.   Our food was nothing to complain about, really. You could do worse on any given evening (it's probably a much better night-stop?) But we came out both realizing we had our fill of fried food and that we couldn't think of anything on the menu that we would want to make a return trip for."}
{"text":"It was a rainy day in Montreal and I had a craving for some hot ramen. Coming from Vancouver, which is spoiled with good Asian food, and having been to Japan a few times, where my taste for ramen originates, I thought I'd give this place a shot. I didn't expect to find authentic Asian food in Montreal to begin with and let me start by saying this place definitely doesn't impress.  In terms of its decor, if you're looking for a tacky, run-down 50's theme then this place will shake your milk. I was seated in the \"singles\" section, at a bar facing the wall - nothing like an appetizing view of peeling paint. Not sure why they didn't make a bar by the bar. I was also disappointed that they didn't have a place to put my umbrella like a real Japanese place would have. They missed that practical feature but put some effort into setting up a display area full of cheap Japanese-looking stationery supplies and an Astroboy figurine by the restrooms. All part of keeping up appearances I guess.  As for the food, I ordered the pork \"miso ramen.\" It came in a dirty- and oily-looking brown broth that did not even come close to real miso ramen in taste intensity. It came with a standard soft-boiled egg that was cold on the inside - made me question how long ago it was prepared. The pork had fake grill lines on it - I think it was another move to appease the local Macdo palate. There was a bit of corn thrown in there as well, and some bean sprouts, pho-style! The ramen itself was too soft and could have been instant noodles. To go with the Vietnamese theme, the spoon they provided was a tiny dumpling scooper. Another little detail they missed was that Japanese spice mix that all ramen places have - I guess nobody in Montreal ever asks or even knows what that is. I also saw on the menu that 500 ml bottles of Asahi are $9... Are you kidding me?! The ramen was $12, twice the price you would pay in Japan for the real thing.  I paid my bill to whom I thought was the manager, a Chinese-looking man with heavily pomaded hair and 50s looking fake glasses possibly procured from urban outfitters - although most likely from a dollar store.  Overall, my meal was nothing special and nothing close to real ramen. This place is tacky, fake, overpriced, and doesn't have good ramen. I don't appreciate the irony of the name either. If I have one good thing to say it's that the menu was simple. Don't let this place ruin your impression of Japan - it has absolutely no resemblance to Japan or to Japanese food."}
{"text":"Yummo.  I've been to this place quite a few times now, and it's safe to say that I love it.   Do not expect to receive fine Japanese-only cuisine, as Big in Japan does Japanese fusion cuisine, and boy are they good at it.   First off, the décor: Cafeteria style with all of the Japanese quirks. Got to love the kiosk selling funky accessories.   Second, the cheap beer; they offer very cheap beer that will satisfy any beer drinker's appetite.  Third, the food; sooooo goood. I would suggest you share the potato croquettes and ravioli as an entrée and then share a couple of main dishes. The pork is always a good choice as it is cooked to perfection. I had the pork-braised salad and my friend had the beef noodles with eggplant. It was delicious.   Come to this place for the amazing fusion menu that is sure to surprise you and the low key cafeteria-style room filled with hipsters."}
{"text":"Cool bar, nice and quiet. Love the secret door thing, it's very NYC secret dive bar feel.  Very nice ambiance, and the drinks are nice. Wish the selection was more extensive both for the cocktails and snacks.  My one caveat was I had the same drink three times, and it never tasted the same all three times. So for drinks consistency, it's a complete FAIL. However the drinks were still drinkable, but making the same drink differently every time just really turns me off.  Had a great time there last night with my coworkers. Perfect place for a 5 a 7 during the weekdays since it's not packed at all."}
{"text":"I read that it was a must see bar in the area and after some confusing directions from Google we found the unmarked black door.  You had to find your own seat and after a minute or so we found three chairs facing a glass wall with a curtain behind it.  The menu had a good but somewhat pricey selection of  drinks, but it was dark enough to not really be able to read the menu. We were told to turn down the light on our cell and my friend noticed an odd smell, and quickly decided it was not our night and left before ordering."}
{"text":"Delightful soup and great after bar crowd. Chef shook my hand even though I was drunk enough to want to hug him. Staff laughed and didn't kick me out. Great customer service in that regard. Can't get the t-shirt unless you work there so few options in the t-shirt department."}
{"text":"I took the miso steak to share. It came with 3 grilled scallops, 3 fried croquettes, flavorful rice, roasted vegetables, and a fresh salad on top. The rib steak was cooked perfectly. It takes 30 minutes to prepare so they suggested that we take an appetizer. We took sake steamed clams. Everything was prepared so beautifully. The steak was rare just the way that I like it. The shared platter came to $72. I would say that it's big enough for three people actually. I recommend this restaurant and I would go again."}
{"text":"I had heard really good things about the food at Big In Japan so was very eager to try it but the waiter was SO rude to us that we got up and walked out, something that I NEVER do. Shame, because my opinion of the place is now tainted and I didn't even taste the food."}
{"text":"Get the Negroni.    Atmosphere: appears somewhat fancy at first, but a closer look and you see the unpretentious crowd doesn't match the Sinatra-esque vibe.  Expect to spend a bit of money. Not overly priced, but not cheap.  Doorman has a killer moustache."}
{"text":"This is NOT an authentic Japanese restaurant. I went with a group of friends who eat frequent Japanese food. We all agreed that the food was not good.   The miso ramen tasted like instant noodles with msg and salt.  The pitcher alcohol for $35 (Ginger and lemon) tasted diluted....   Only people who have never tasted real Japanese food would give this a 5 star, no offense.  Stay away."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and saw great ratings. Walked in and loved the ambiance and the waiter seemed very sweet but the time the manager/owner(short asian guy) walks in to help, he ruins the whole mood. I have never met someone with such bad energy. I looked at the menu and asked him if they have more snacks and his response \"you need to go to a restaurant if you wanna eat\". We planned to spend a great amount of time and try every drinks on the menu but unfortunately, he ruined it and we had to leave. I am sure this place got great ratings because of the other servers.  Guys,if u need great drinks with great service, stop by The coldroom. The drinks are awesome and people working there are awesome too! You won't regret. To this manager/owner, you have got horrible reviews from so many people. You need to stay home and hire someone else. What a JERK!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews on yelp. Been here more than a couple times and have been consistently disappointed by the quality of the service and drinks. It's easy to get fooled by the decor of this place but their quality of cocktails is absolutely subpar.  Service staff has been always been rude. The manager is probably one of the worst persons i've met in my life. No kidding."}
{"text":"Wow belle ambiance ! Decore agreable et chaleureux . Bon speak easy ! La musique est sympa ,look decontracté et agreable ! Bonne place pour une sortie en amoureux"}
{"text":"At first I though the place was ok, not especially tasty or anything, but good enough if in need of some calories. But after further reflection, and after burping fried chicken burps for about 4 hours after eating, I've decided that big in japan isn't worth the trip at all. The food court seating is somewhat lame as well."}
{"text":"Great experience, especially if you are new to Montreal, the address is wrong though, and the door is black now. There's always a line but as soon as you get in, the atmosphere is great and the drinks are good, good advice from my experience don't go in the corner in the back, it ruins the experience. Will definetely go back again."}
{"text":"Actually I don't even know how to start this review. My friend warned me before about how unauthentic this place is,and I regret that I didn't listen to her... Ok first of all it's not a isakaya at all,not even close, it feels like some kind of asian fast food Resto which also sells beer(and also u have to order one entree or two appetizers ,then you're allowed to order beers).  The miso ramen we ordered was just one word --\"plain\". There is no flavour in it ,maybe just a bit instant miso paste.   The crispy pork which was recommended by our waitress was below average, although the side arugula salad was pretty good .  I think I'll try another \"real \"isakaya next time ."}
{"text":"Good ambience, very pretty layout but the food is pretty bad. The cocktails were overly diluted and it was not  tasty."}
{"text":"Good food but frustrating experience. Impossible to make minor adjustments. Staff not responsive to patrons (even arguing with patrons.) OVERPRICED."}
{"text":"Bel endroit, mais carte très limité se veut bar à cocktail mais choix très sommaire. Accueil glacial par le patron \"Japonais\" et service lamentable. Un conseil passez votre chemin."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Beautiful decor, a very friendly and hospitable waitstaff, and a quick witted owner who is eager to please. Not too loud, not too crowded. The drinks are PHENOMENAL. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Not a Foodies paradise! Anthony Bourdain should be ashamed for even listing Big In Japan.  Bad Ramen that lacked any collegen, Bad Pork Buns with over cooked dry pork, Cheap Wine. Over priced food, poor decor, dirty and the owner was rude to his employee's. Won't be back, left most of the food it was that bad."}
{"text":"Ambiance de folie ! J'adore le style original ! A faire sur Montréal en groupe ou couple !"}
{"text":"This is a beautifully designed space  They took a shitty room and turned it into an elegant unique bar. The design is truly fab.   Some tips:  1) Go on weeknights.  I have never waited on a weeknight and always find it great. 2) Avoid large groups.  Its not really made like that.  The whole place has bar seating so more than 4 people is gonna be a pain. 3) Get into the whisky. Everything else is expensive."}
{"text":"The menu looks somewhat interesting. I was craving noodles so I had the Mabo Nazu ramen which was not so great, the meat was a bit dry and the broth was wayyyy too salty. The portion was very generous though. Although the servers were nice they were hard to get a hold of, I had to keep trying to wave down the waiters to take my order and to pay. Overall, I have had better ramen in many other places. I may return to try some of their other dishes and review again in the future, but the ramen is a dud."}
{"text":"I respect the fact that it's virtually unadvertised. I live in the area and never noticed that red door until meeting friends for drinks there around 10:30 last Friday night.  We were the last 4 people to get in before a line began to form outside, but it never felt too cramped or crowded.  Our bill was huge, but we had a great time.  Went on a tuesday after work and found the Negroni wasn't quite as delicious as the first time, and found the atmosphere a bit dark for 7pm, but It's a rad spot."}
{"text":"Went back to Big in Japan a few years later and had a way better experience. Loved the spicy ramen, so delicious. The mabo nasu was also really good. Would pass on the sake biru and go for the straight sake next time."}
{"text":"Best surprise of my trip was finding this hole in the wall. Behind an unmarked black door is a classy, unique bar with the most polite staff and intimate lighting. The set up is amazing, it feels exclusive - are you a pair of two looking for a quiet drink and some nice conversation? Go.   10 out of 10 Chelseas recommend."}
{"text":"I've never been too impressed with the service or the food.   Most menu items are Japanese brasserie fare, meaning deep-fried and un-exceptional. Flagging down the wait staff for another drinks can also be a challenge.  The open concept kitchen let's you watch the staff at work, which is fun, but I've lost count of how many times I've watched the owner verbally abuse and bully his staff over the most trivial of things. It's always made me uncomfortable, and really detracts from the dining experience  I end up back here with groups of friends from time to time, but it's never my choice. There are plenty of other pubs in the area if you're interested in pub group and in the mood to pound beers; but if you're set on a Japanese experience, I'd cross over to the west side of downtown to Imadake."}
{"text":"Certains s'offusqueront du refus de réaliser un Mojito, un Cosmo ou encore un single malt Old-Fashioned... Néanmoins, il y a très peu de bars a Montreal qui ont des principes aussi forts, et un professionnalisme extraordinaire. A voir."}
{"text":"First time here, might be a bit difficult to spot the entrance as it's just a door with no labels on Boyle St Laurente.  The atmosphere is amazing, very intimate and cozy, while the music in the background is loud enough to be heard but not overbearing.  The drinks are great.  We had the GIn Buck and the Paso Double, if you're a fan of G&T, then you'll love either of these, the Paso Double is stronger while the Gin Buck is more citrus-y.  Would definitely come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere Hidden Awesome Bar  This is a great spot to unwind with the significant other after a long and hard day at work. Drinks are a lil on the pricey side, but worth it. Recommend."}
{"text":"This place is not \"big\" anywhere except the ego of the people that run this place. Came in on a Thursday night to a relatively empty dinning room and got seated at the bar. Our orders were not taken until 10 minutes later, even though we sat next the the cashier. Finally, we got the orders in and the real nightmare started.   First, the neighbouring table that came in after us received their food before us. We had the miso ramen and the tuna tataki donburi; in my mind, our order wasn't anything overtly extravagant. My ramen was lukewarm and the noodle was overcooked. Although I am relatively competent in using chopsticks, I was unable to pick up the noodles without having them break up and fall back down into the flavourless brown liquid that claimed to be miso broth. Perhaps this was to allow the less proficient chopstick users to scoop up their food with the spoon. On the bright side, the pork slices were generously portioned. And the soft boiled egg was relatively flavourful.   My dinner companion's tuna tataki donburi was less tragic. It was heavily seasoned with miso paste and perhaps sesame oil. It was fortunate that the dish was over-sauced because the tuna had absolutely no freshness to it. The rice was overcooked and for some strange reason, very oily. There was a pool of tasteless grease that collected at the bottom of the bowl. At least the shredded cabbage used to garnish the dish was crisp.   The menu has been revamped since the place first opened and visited by celebrity chefs. It now resembles Momofuku of New York (not a huge fan, to say the least). Given the strong ramen/izakaya trend that is happening in the city these days, it is very hard to believe that Big In Japan is still relevant.   TL;DR. Service was bad, food was atrocious; don't go."}
{"text":"Eh.  It was OK.  Really cool and weird layout inside, so would be a great date spot.  Yet it was also pretentious with pretty basic cocktails."}
{"text":"Los dos discretos ideogramas de la puerta que rezan \"Bar\" en japonés, constituyen el único indicio de que detrás de esa puerta, hay, en efecto, un bar.   Emulando un \"speakeasy\" de los años 20, Big in Japan es un pequeño local elegante y con carácter, perfecto para una velada íntima alrededor de una sofisticada barra de bar. Jazz, velas y camareros impecables componen el escenario perfecto para disfrutar de unos cócteles clandestinos en pleno Boulevard de Saint Laurent."}
{"text":"thurs night at 11pm ... They say their full... ???   So either they didn't like what I was wearing or they just wanted a line... Cause I saw through the door and they weren't busy.. So :(   This place isn't welcoming.... and honesty... I have been inside... I don't know if it's really worth the hassle to get in.  Don't bother ... Suggest majestique (4105 same street)"}
{"text":"A very interesting design and great service. A little overhyped though, not a big menu and only had saki to drink. Which was still nice but I wanted a bit more of a selection. A good place to bring a new date."}
{"text":"Went to big in japan last Saturday with a girlfriend... Gotta say this is probably my best experience thus far !    I've been to big in japan several times before, some are better than others. It was mostly because of the service, seeing as it usually takes 45min + to prepare my food. However this time, the waitress was extremely friendly, and food was relatively fast (compared to previous experience) and the food was DELICIOUS. We had the age Goyza to start (Japanese dumplings), which was perfectly deep fried and went extremely well with the sauce. Thinking about it gives me the drools right now. Then for the mains, I had the braised pork with rice while my friend had the tonkatsu don (deep friend pork chop over rice). Both were excellent ! I really recommend the braised pork dish ! beware of the portion, it is GIGANTIC. This is the perfect place to go if you want some comfort food before passing out in front of your couch watching netflix. Of course, even though we were both extremely full from our main, we couldn't help but order some dessert. We had the green tea cake with ginger icecream, which i would definitely go back for ! I was surprised how much matcha flavor was in the green tea cake, which paired perfectly with the ginger ice-cream (surprisingly okay! ).    If you're in for some large portion comfort food that's not burgers and pizza, give big in japan a try, think you'll be pleasantly surprised !"}
{"text":"Ambiance intime, tamisé, musique pas trop forte. Parfait pour prendre un verre, discuter et grignoter. Notre tartare de thon était excellent. Magnifique décor avec le bar en serpentin."}
{"text":"Not only are the servers so attractive but the drinks are delicious and strong. The ambience tends towards romantic but it would still be a great hang spot for a close friend get together or for visitors out of town."}
{"text":"I went here on a sunday with a girlfriend. It wasn't too packed! We were able to sit close to the window in the front of the restaurant. I've been to Big in Japan about 3 times now and I normally enjoy myself here, but I have to admit that I would rather eat elsewhere. It was my friend's first time here and she'd been wanting to try it out for a while. The decoration is pretty fun, with japanese banners here and there. And in the back, they have booths, but it's darker there because there are no windows. Also, the first time I came here, they had the TVs on (some on the ceiling), showing some kind of japanese arts and crafts show for kids. It was very bizarre but entertaining. It gives the restaurant its charm, I guess! I have to say that I have eaten better elsewhere (try out an izakaya!). One of my favorite dishes here are the pork buns... they are just too good with their amazing sweet sauce. So sunday, we had the buns (obviously!) and the miso ramen. My friend commented that the ramen wasn't the best she's had and that it was too salty. I have to agree with her. I wouldn't recommend taking the ramen here as it doesn't portray the real deal. The last times I came here, I took the crispy pork on rice which is really good! Very tasty with the same kind of sweet sauce as the pork buns. One thing that I cannot get over and is the reason why I keep coming back here : the matcha milkshake. It is divine. SO good! A year ago, I came here with a group of people that don't live in Montreal and I ordered myself the milkshake (with my meal, yes) and made everyone taste it. Seconds later, everyone had ordered one for themselves. That's how good it is! It's a must-try!  PS: if you do take the ramen, I suggest you take one and split it amongst yourselves and take other dishes to taste different things, as opposed to everyone taking their own ramen."}
{"text":"Went there for a lunch yesterday with a colleague. We arrived 11:45 to avoid the lunch rush. There's wasn't one to speak of, many tables available through the lunch hour. Service was friendly, bilingual, knowledgeable, and super helpful. Both of us ordered the ramen soup. It had chunks of braised pork (feve aux lard pork) what contributed to the unctuousness of the soup...a few greasy calories as well. It was delicious. A whole soft boiled egg, bits of vegetables and rich both with the noodles made for a very satisfying lunch. Still, a bowl of soup and a small beer will run you twenty bucks. Once in a while paying oneself a treat is worth it."}
{"text":"Pretentiousness in its purest form.  The bar was relatively empty, yet there was line at the door.  Upon entering, the main host asked if we spoke French or English.  When we said English, he told us to go \"back behind the curtain,\" at the back of the bar. For a Japanese whiskey bar, they only had TWO Japanese whiskeys to try.  The same host was very curt and abrupt when we ordered our drinks.  When the rest of our party arrived, they were seated in the front section, but told where they could and could not sit.  Honestly, we had such a friendlier experience at the Cloakroom the night before, that this \"speakeasy-esque\" bar simply pales in comparison.  I would not go to Big in Japan again.  This is a simple bar with the exclusivity of an Hollywood club, but without the class or friendliness.  What a let down."}
{"text":"Si le décor est peu impressionnant, vous serez surpris par les succulents mets japonais qu'on y retrouve. J'ai pris la crêpe au porc, qui fut une agréable surprise! Chacun de notre groupe de 4 a été heureux de son choix!"}
{"text":"Love that place. Love the music. The drinks. The overall experience of a cozy and trendy place."}
{"text":"A great concept, a beautiful space, and well-crafted cocktails. Sadly, the owner treats his employees and guests with such disrespect that my last experience there made me vow never to return. I felt very uncomfortable witnessing him being condescending toward his staff. If you care about who you're supporting when you spend money in bars, I strongly suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a fun speakeasy with great drinks. I loved the simple decor and elegant uniforms. There was a short line to get in but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Personally I feel the reviews if this place are pretty harsh. This place certainly isn't refined but that's not the point. I don't think I would ever want to come here for dinner but for some drinks and some snacks it's a nice stop. It is true that the menu consists largely of fried items but I found most of what I tried to be pretty tasty, minus the croquettes which were quite bland. The price of the tapas seem fair but the specials are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Someone else said this place was Murakami-esque -- it is! We waited outside about 30sh minutes to get in on a Saturday night, and immediately saw that it was worth the wait. Did not get the feeling that this was a very touristy place, as lots of locals were there, trying to get in as well.  Walk in and it's a unique, sexy, perfectly lit bar with nattily dressed staff and a subdued, but just-edgy-enough vibe. In another, bigger city, this place would be swarmed night in and out. Anyway, they play great music, make strong drinks, have friendly and attentive staff (including one of the owners, who is an interesting dude). You also get the vibe that they are very detail-oriented (my napkin/coaster was changed...many times).  The bar setup is unique: it is kind of an undulating sine wave within which the staff are constantly milling to take your orders and mix your drinks. Speaking of which, the Gin Buck is a great drink, and packs a bit of a punch. Definitely hope to be returning someday."}
{"text":"Yuck. A long wait. The place seemed dirty and smelled bad. Nice staff, but understaffed. And the food was bad in Japan! How do you mess up edamame? We left hungry because the first three dishes ranged from icky to so-so. The beer was cheap."}
{"text":"PLANNING TO APPLY FOR A JOB HERE? PLEASE READ THIS FIRST!  There is a reason why Big in Japan is constantly on the lookout for staff through craiglists, no one stays, and for good reasons:  Step 1: You will spend money buying, maintaining and re-buying your uniform. The dress code is very strict. Don't forget to buy a specific bottle opener because you will be told to re-buy items until you get exactly what they want.  Step 2: It is just your first week and you have a question? No, you must already know everything. Don't you dare asking, you will get told that you are not professional.  Step 3: Which would be fine if it paid off, but it doesn't. Tips are pathetic and the salary is minimum wage. You may be staying at work until 5-6am and not be paid past 4am. It is not for you to decide. Well, nothing is. Perks? Not for you honey. No discounts, no perks, no staff party of any kind. Oh wait, you do get a free drink at the end of your shift, but you will hate the place so much that you will not want it. If you do take it though, make sure you drink it as fast as you can and don't talk to the other staff.  Step 4: You cannot touch objects or lean against them, you must stand straight at all times. Worked for 12 hours? Your problem.  Step 5: Constant disrespect from your boss and a reminder that you are nothing to no one and can be replaced. You will be insulted in front of clients regularly.   Step 6: Just forget that you are in a bar. You cannot laugh, you cannot drink and you certainly cannot entertain clients. Just make sure you sell that 20$ drink and get out.   Step 7: If you ever quit, no one tells you a thing. It is for you to figure out when your final pay is ready, where to get it and from whom.   The owner is a bipolar alcoholic who cares about nothing but money. He talks down at costumers and staff every night of the week. Unless you want to be in a hell hole, avoid this place.  The only people who stay there are those who don't speak French because they can't find another bar job."}
{"text":"This speakeasy place has a nice atmosphere. The cocktails are affordable and well mixed...a perfect place for a date. Get there early before it gets crowded"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened as I'm a big fan of the resto by the same name down the block. I live out of town & still make it a destination to pop into. In the business of decorating in larger cities, the interior matches my expectations, it's clever & probably is what draws me back. The drinks are ok & the bartenders seem happy ( nothing mind blowing, but average) & the crowd is good on a week night. however!  if first impressions are everything I have to say the door staff is the cockiest I've ever encountered. Walking through a friday night line-up to meet a friend inside, the logic floats somewhere else in the ozone. The door staff immediately heard my feminine frame into a 20min line-up, I mean geezus, I didn't dress up to be man-handled.  The jurisdiction was that I couldn't  even think about speaking or inhabiting the space at the bar my friend reserved for me upon my arrival, until I wasted my life in that line. Being not of the foolish sort, I proceeded to ask (& laugh) to speak to my friend in plain view to explain to him my situation. The door staff, though in suits with bow-ties and though ironically lacking all composure, forgot proper etiquette on how to speak to a lady, making all threats as to what would happen if I were to pass by the velvet curtain. I came in peace with my manners, however at this point it was wise to not reason with stupidity & just straight out  wave my friend down. Though the venue is small I do understand why they must attain a regulated capacity, however releasing this, it did cross my mind to think there would be room for a few extra inhabitants if the door staff's ego's weren't taking up triple their own personal space... finally I harnessed my friends attention & we fled to a much more loud but welcoming bar; Bily Kun."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit this place for quite some time. When my friend and I were searching for a quiet and yet classy place to have some drinks and gossip, we went here. There are no visible signs that you have entered the correct place, which I love. It feels almost exclusive and private, the entrance was a narrow walkway which opens into the beautiful space. I really enjoyed the décor of this place such as the style of seating. My friend and I sat next to eachother with the option of facing away or towards other patrons. The seats are designed like an on-going bar. The lights are dim with candles everywhere.   We ordered a bottle of Prosecco and gin and tonics. The service was great, our glasses were always full. There was some nice house music which was not overly loud or annoying. The prices are reasonable as well. There was an option to eat near the rear of the bar. I would love to return in a larger group soon."}
{"text":"Gorgeous ambiance... romantic, intimate and very decor-savvy. The photos don't do it justice cause the entire place is candle lit! Great unique whisky as well and the nostalgic music tunes can't be beat. This is a perfect date spot or a place to come to spend quality time with friends. One time in the summer of 2015 we were here on a slow night, we look to the end of the bar and who's there? BONO! Effing Bono from U2 was in town.. he was just chillin with friends and no one was giving him any grief or glory. Anyway, that's the kind of spot this is."}
{"text":"MMmmm mmm yummy! And a cool, hip atmosphere - you can tell a lot of effort went into the place. But the clincher is definitely the food. Try the chicken! YOu will be craving this place after the first taste - I think that may be why they are one of the busiest restos in town!"}
{"text":"If you are accustomed to good Japanese food; say that in Vancouver, you will hardly be able to swallow this. Hard dry rice, western style salad posing as Japanese fare, and an overcooked dry salmon was my dish. My fellow diners didn't finish their meals either. The service was mediocre, betting the fact it's a bar, but I wasn't expecting too much, so that's not the main disappointment. Bad service can always be forgiven if there is great food. But bad service and bad food at prices that are not even cheap is unforgivable... Cocktail concoctions also left something to be desired; too sweet and just mixes that try to be adventuresome but failing. Food also took forever to arrive. The only reason why this is not a 1 star is because I've actually seen worse. If I could give it a 2.5, I think that would be more accurate. But it's closer to a 2 than a 3 for sure; hence my rating. Just stay away from Asian food in Montreal is probably a good idea."}
{"text":"Very beautiful decor for a bar, has a romantic vibe to it but lacks a little bit of music, the ambiance felt a little bit sad. besides that, great delicious strong cocktails"}
{"text":"I dig this spot.   Very hidden, intimate, private, and classy drinks. The food menu is small and pricy, so come here for a  drink. I love the simple, yet intricate details in the seating..glass...and bar top here. Its all about being able to sip a drink and enjoy a convo here. Bartenders are classy, and over all serve you great. Id come back for sure, i just loved the atmosphere. Also, any speakeasy that has cards for their business is an interesting place in my book. i grabbed about 3."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée hier pour le lunch et j'ai pris le menu spécial du midi a 15$ ( ça ne comprend rien d'autre que le plat, de la mon léger désapointement)  '' Tataki de boeuf et curry de sésame noir sur riz. Accompagné de roquette en vinaigrette. (voir photo). '' Tout simplement DIVIN. J'ai vraiment été surprise par le goût sucré/salé de la sauce contrastant avec le boeuf tataki. Magnifiquement présenté et la portion parfaite. Le boeuf d'une fraîcheur saisissante. Le menu offre du 'comfort food' japonais, de quoi contraster avec la fine cuisine du même pays ( sushi, tempura & compagnie)  Le service fut rapide, courtois et discret. J'aime dîner en tête a tête avec mon livre et le gentil dude au comptoir a compris. J'aime aussi le fait que la plupart des tables donnent sur le comptoir, qui est aussi la cuisine a aire ouverte. On peut voir les chefs confectionner ton plat ' juste la ' . Ce qui est bien et assure une certaine transparence, c'est toujours rassurant pour moi. Ils offrent une bonne sélection de bière que je n'ai pas pu goûter étant donné le fait que j'étais sur mon heure de lunch au travail, mais j'ai bien hâte d'y retourner.  Autre ++ : ouvert jusqu'a 3h du matin, situé sur st-laurent.. pour moi ça rime snack d'apres bar ! yessss. Il y a aussi un petit comptoir cute ou ils vendent des items japonais, c'est un peu out of space, mais c'est cute. La déco est ravissante et l'endroit en soi est vraiment cozy."}
{"text":"Very cool speakeasy type bar. Incredible ambience, but ridiculously expensive. Funny story - I went there on a date and was kicking back Japanese whiskeys for a few hours. My bill was $270. That night I had a nightmare about how expensive the bill was. Not even a joke."}
{"text":"Love the music and the ambience. Food is decent to good but nothing to write home about really. The pork buns are probably the best thing on the menu. Ramen is decent but their noodles are very out of the can vibe."}
{"text":"Discreet door as the entrance, intriguing..as you walk in, you brace yourself and don't know what it would look like inside. You come to another curtain and there you are, inside. I have to say it was a very intimate, romantic setting that was architecturally amusing to my eyes. Candles everywhere with a swirly shape bar setting. The waitresses can maneuver through these paths and the service was impeccable! I had one of the BEST Manhattans there with premium Eagle Rare bourbon. Just amazing and highly recommend their drinks and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Si vous êtes à la recherche d'un bar avec votre date, cette place vaut définitivement le détour! On se laisse charmer immédiatement par l'ambiance tamisée et les nombreuses chandelles! Un vaste choix de cocktails sont disponibles! Ne soyez pas surpris par le prix par contre."}
{"text":"i agree that the seating is odd. but the food is exceptional especially for the price. the menu is truly montreal meats japan (spelling is correct) = very unique. great late night menu. fast service when it isn't packed. one of my favorites on the plateau."}
{"text":"Ambiance feutré. Service stylé avec portier et serveur en livré. Les cocktails sont de qualités et le service très soigné. On y retourne soit pour un tête à tête amoureux ou en gang de chums. Petite musique retro, éclairage feutré, entrée très (très) discrète mais absolument pas déçu en arrivant. Le bar occupe tout l'espace central, ce qui rend le service efficace et mets la qualité des boissons au centre. Le décor, les cocktails et le service : on y retourne pour continuer la dégustation."}
{"text":"Located on the corner of st Laurent and pine right next to all the action. Cool atmosphere... It's like a oriental pub which caters to western society, serves oriental beer and plays American 80's music. My boyfriend and I were seated right away ... The restaurant seemed busy but not overcapacity. The waitress was very nice and constantly filling up our glass with water. However, she was not the one bringing us our dishes and she kept pacing up and down our isle and looking at our table which is nice but a lil annoying...  Like I'm in the middle of eating, I don't want to give you feed back while I'm chewing my food. Besides that, I ordered the pork buns and the miso Katsu Don ! Both were unique in taste, enjoyable and left me with that good taste in my mouth after you have a flavourful meal. Prices were not expensive and reasonable for the quantity, quality and presentation. (12-17$ for a main course)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spot with my boyfriend or a girl friend. Very romantic decor & intimate with the candles around, this is the perfect spot for a date! The way the bar is set up makes it unique. I love sitting and watching people. You go there for the tuna tataki, but mostly for the plum wine. Yummy! I have to admit that the French music from the 50s can sound romantic at first, but all night long and after few times there, this stops me from going now. They could alternate."}
{"text":"C'est le \" first kiss\" bar par excellence! Mesdames si on vous y invite il est fort possible qu'il  \"mouve\". Éclairage aux lampions, musique rétro propice à la détente, plein de recoins intimes et des drinks servi dans un bol (un peu comme un punch)... Une fois envoûté par la musique et enivré par l'alcool un peu trop sucré vous tomberez peut-être sous le charme comme sous la mitraille...   Pourquoi 4/5: Les proprios de Big in Japan réussissent avec se bar ,ce qu'il ne sont pas arrivé à réaliser avec leur resto. Un endroit unique et original à Montréal. Ils ont transformés un bar crade en un endroit presque parfait. Se fut un coup de foudre instantané.  Si ça vous intéresse et avez les $$$$$, vous pouvez acheter votre bouteilles de whisky. Elle sera suspendu bien en vue maintenu par un aimant au dessus du bar.... dépêchez-vous le nombre d'espaces disponibles sont limités!  Mesdames si je vous y invite un soir de scotch et de brouillard vais-je y faire un \" mouve\" sentimental... et bien non pour le \"first kiss\" je préfère les parcs et les ruelles... mais ça c'est une autre histoire...."}
{"text":"Finding this place isn't too hard if you pay attention to the street numbers. There is no descriptive awning on the outside though.  Walking in, there is a really cool vibe with the wrap around bar and bottles hanging from the ceiling.  The drinks were decent. And make sure you don't lose that card they give you for your check as they will charge you $10. Then again, I'm unsure why a card system is necessary in the first place."}
{"text":"I like this place. Then again I live in Brooklyn. The food's not great but passable Japanese \"Izakaya\" bar food. People who work here seem very comfortable, polite, and genuine, in an indie-nerdy kinda way which would fit right into LES or East Village in NYC. Nice to hear Johnny Cash and slurp udon in a non-pretentious place on St Laurent."}
{"text":"Je n'ai vraiment plus l'habitude d'aller dans les bars...je m'explique... faire un long line up pour un bar me semble un peu extrême. Mais lorsque l'on franchit c'est petite porte en métal, la magie opère, un style speakeasy japonais, des petites bougies...c'est trop mignon. Le lieu est assez intime et agréable pour un petit verre en amoureux. Petit bémol, la carte des sans-alcools n'est pas très créative. Vous me direz pourquoi aller dans un bar pour du sans-alcool, je suis certaine que l'on peut aussi être créatif sans-alcool. Aussi, l'accueil du patron était super mais le service était glacial. Dommage..."}
{"text":"Probablement que la recommandation de ma serveuse sur \"un must de l'endroit\" n'a pas aidé mon appréciation de la place. J'ai tenté un porc au curi et sésame (rien à dire sur le porc, il était vraiment tendre et savoureux), mais c'est plutôt l'étrange et dense sauce brune dans lequel il baignait qui m'a laissé perplexe. Les dumplings étaient par contre de leur côté vraiment succulents. Belle ambiance, j'y retournerais pour essayer autres chose, tous les plats qui sortaient de la cuisine étaient très appétissants...j'ai l'impression d'avoir simplement fait un mauvais choix."}
{"text":"When we got there we asked to wait on the side by the washroom, we grabbed a drink and a few minutes later we were seated at a counter table beside the kitchen. We had there appetizers and a couple rounds of drinks. Food was pretty good but felt the waitress was rushing us, taking away our food even while we still eating it, twice."}
{"text":"I would give it 4 stars but the price of the menu brings it down one star for me. The drinks are great but it is very expensive. So definitely not a casual place where people can go all the time. For me, a bar has to make me wanna come back whenever I feel like drinking, everything draws me back ( service, waiters, drinks, ambiance) except the price. I work full time and I wouldn't go there more than maybe once a month.   The food was ridiculously over priced. Pecans for 8$, and the Japanese assorted chip mix, 5$ for a tiny bowl. I had a salad the size of a bread plate and it cost me 12 $ and I didn't even like it. The meat did not taste good. It tasted old.   Honestly, I had fun the times I've gone, but it is not somewhere I would go unless it was a special occasion."}
{"text":"The worst experience I have ever had, server was rude and was more concerned with clearing tables than serving us. Server said \"I am not paid to smile\" when we went to speak to the manager he said he instructed her to be less than accommodating because one of our friends didn't order a drink (our DD) the manager walked away as we tried to provide them with feedback. STAY AWAY DEFINITE VIBE KILL!!!"}
{"text":"So, it took us a couple minutes to find the discreet black door with very tiny letters reading 'BAR' but once we did, we felt like we had uncovered a mystery which made walking down the curtained hallway even more enjoyable. My boyfriend and I stopped by for a drink on a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy.   The bartender wasn't overly friendly but she was informative and timely. My boyfriend got a Manhattan which was very strong (but good!) and I got a Tokyo Mule. I knew I loved Moscow Mules so I was interested in trying it and it did not disappoint. I would go back there specifically for that drink, honestly. The bar felt really cozy, romantic and exclusive which turned out to be a great combination.   I would caution visitors against going with a big group--probably 4 people MAX. The seats are dispersed along the curving bar so it might be difficult finding a spot where you are together comfortably. But I would strongly recommend it for a date night!"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal from Toronto. I arrived late at night and found this place near the hotel. Glad they were open.  Interior: the inside looks like a old diner.   Food: I had Sloppy Joe Bun and Yakitori Don. The Bun is amazing - soft Bun, nicely seasoned ground beef and wonderful wasabi mustard. The Don was ok. It was missing a spicy kick in my opinion.  Service: My experience was normal/average  Conclusion: Two solid dishes and nice interior.  Pretty good spot for a hungry traveler at 11 pm."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful bar. I would say I wish they offered more food options, as the snacks are very limited in options, but I loved the vibe. The decor is tasteful, and romantic. It's a great place to bring a date, or have an intimate conversation with friends. It's for a more mature crowd, and the cocktails are made deliciously. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Fraîcheur et savoir-faire qualité 10/10 Service 8/10 Propreté 10/10 J'ai déjà hâte pour ma prochaine visite!"}
{"text":"Came here a few years ago and didn't like. Decided to give it another chance: also didn't like it.   Food wise, it's very ordinary. The tuna in my tuna tataki don didn't taste very fresh and half of the plate consisted of greens. It wasn't cheap and i wasn't at all full after finishing everything. The pork katsu wasn't very tender and it just felt like an oily piece of meat covered in too much sauce to cover it up. It also came with a bunch of greens and nothing much.   As for the restaurant itself, the chairs and tables are like those in a fast food restaurant in the 90s (tables and seats glued together and glued to the floor).   No good food and no good ambiance. Definitely wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Can I give you no stars?  So we were a group of seven, we all ordered drinks except two people, our designated drivers of the night.  One our server, extremely rude. My friend stated the drink was so bitter he couldn't taste it; she stated she'd have to charge anyways for another one.  So sure no worries. All our drinks were poorly made, then she gave us a little cup of syrup to mix in and sweeten it ourselves.  Sure.  Then we're about to leave, we're drinking our drinks and the server goes are you done your drink?  We go back to ask her why she's rude, she says she's not paid to smile and doesn't care. We ask to speak manager, he goes quote on quote:  I instructed her to behave that way with your guys because we usually don't serve people where everyone doesn't order.  Rushed to clear our drinks and pushed us out.  Great job guys: no line outside but yes feel free to push us out.  Never again.   Just for the service."}
{"text":"Très bon, et superbe rapport qualité prix, pour 15 $ (taxes incluses).   J'ai mangé la crèpe misoyaki excellent porc et crevettes nordiques excellente avec une bonne touche de luzerne et crudité très bon !   Je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de gouter à la bière maison.  Very good pork and nordic shrimps(misoyaki crepe), with a nice touch of alfafa.   I think it worth the 15$ (taxes included). I like it a lot but i didn't have time to taste the beer they made. The beer is supposed to be good !"}
{"text":"A tricky-to-find bar (there's no sign on the door - just check Google Street View before heading out). Great candle-lit ambience and classy servers. Interesting bar layout makes it easy for servers to attend to customers. Had a couple of 'glasses' of Prosecco for about 24 CAD. Apparently hard to get served if you're not actually seated."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! My husband and I ventured over to this bar after a recommendation from a friend who used to live in Montreal. We arrived a bit after 10 on a rainy Thursday night and after knocking on the door were told to wait outside.  After a 10 min wait we gained entry expecting the place to be packed- nope! They just had us wait to make it look like something cool was going on... strike 1.  As we walked in the owner did not greet us or welcome us in anyway- instead he just shouted and pointed to where we could sit. It was a very nice table though, so ok...  Before ordering our drinks the server asked if we would like to start a tab or pay as we went. Since we didn't know how many drinks we would have we chose the latter.  Ok, so out come the drinks. I had the Between the Sheets and husband got the Blue Hula something. One sip- mine tastes like cheap alcohol, the balance is totally off and it is not well mixed.  When the waiter checks in I tell him as much hoping he will offer to replace it with another choice....Nope! He comes back with a drink stirrer..,.what?! We live in NYC and have had cocktails all over the world.  I have never been tto an establishment where I'm paying $15 a drink that wouldn't replace a cocktail that the customer didn't like.  Strike 2...  A few moments later the waiter returns and asks us to pay our tab. What?! We have had like 2 sips of our drinks.  He explains that's what it means to pay as you go here.  Unbelievable! I have NEVER been asked to pay before finishing drinks ESPECIALLY in a place like this.  Strike 3...  The very short of it... Big in Japan is not worth the hype or the wait.  For truly excellent cocktails and SERVICE check out the Cloakroom.  Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"This place can get busy in the evenings, so brace yourself for a queue! I've come here every so often for their spicy ramen and pork buns. While it's not the best ramen in Montreal (Kinton reigns supreme), it certainly hits the spot if you're in the area. Casual, relaxed atmosphere. Portions are pretty big, beware of the inevitable food coma"}
{"text":"Wow. The staff here is downright racist. Yes, not only rude but racist. We politely pointed out the lack of coordination between the staff at the door and the seating staff to the manager. The manager went to make racist comments on top of being extremely rude. Hopefully, we never get to see him again.  Stay away from this place if you're not from Montreal."}
{"text":"We trekked to this busy street and parked our car in front of this restaurant. The reason was to go to Schwartz's for their Smoked Meat sandwiches but then we saw a very long lineup. Unfortunately, Montreal is in the midst of extreme cold weather that both my wife and daughter refused to lineup under those conditions.   Needing lunch, we decide to give this restaurant a chance. Once we were seated, we realized that our car will be illegally parked in 10 minutes so we got it to go.   We got a Yakitori Don, Katsu Don and Tonkatsu. The dishes were okay. It just wasn't what we all wanted. Prices were a little high too.   The takeout containers were very nice. No styrofoam ones given.   The rating is based on our dishes and it has nothing to do with the restaurant itself and service. The restaurant has some collectibles on display like an Astro Boy figures."}
{"text":"The food was awful and overpriced. It had nothing to do with Japanese food, disgraced the food culture showed no or little respect to the dishes by adding other weird vege mix salad in vinegar in every dish we ordered. It was nothing like what we had expected from the name big in Japan. If your hungry go find somewhere else but if you're adventurous this place definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Pathetic and classless attempt at an upscale, bougie and exclusive bar/lounge... and I am from LA. They give pretentious a bad name.  In -5 Degree F weather they have their customers wait outside (without any line in an open hallway that could be used for waiting because, as their less-than-eloquent host put it, \"they have had people wait inside in the past and steal a seat.\" So tacky and sounds plausible, justified considering the fifteen lonely, seated clients you can expect upon entry on a Friday night.  Upon being seated their staff untimely, immediately bombards you with rules like where your gloves and purse belong (not on the table) whether you are situated yet or not.  At one point we heard the short, asian man that was managing the place that night giving poor customer service advice to his host, encouraging their misguided overassertions. Leadership at its finest.  This is a place managed by \"nobodies\" under their misguided dilusion of the stereotype of how \"somebodies\" conduct themselves.  Most enjoyable part of the experience... writing this review."}
{"text":"I dont why this place is 3 stars. The food is great especially its black cod and crab cakes. Its reasonably priced and service is amazing. When I ever I am confused where, this place always come in handy and I have never been disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Must try the tuna appetizer and any dish with the fried pork so GOOD! It's a small restaurant and sometimes you may need to wait but so worth it."}
{"text":"A little hidden stop. Big in Japan can be confused with the other restaurant. But if you can find it then you'll fall in love with it. The drinks are so good. The staff really knows how to help you find the drink that will make your night. The owner is always there just chatting it up."}
{"text":"La bière maison est délicieuse. Excellent rapport qualité prix. Peu coûteux pour une cuisine aussi avant gardiste.   Un must"}
{"text":"Love love love this place of you want to class it up a notch and whine down with a great cocktail and nice environment this place makes you feel like you aren't even in Montreal."}
{"text":"I come here once a week. Food is always good. Usually I have Miso Ramen or the lunch special Tina Tataki. I think the Tataki is best in town, if there is anywhere else with a betyer tataki I have not had it.  Service can be an issue so come when it's not busy. Also thwir late nite option is great!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday and got a lemonade with a side of PTSD. It's been 2 nights since my night out at Big in North Korea and every time I close my eyes, all I see is the owner's dictatorial/'I have shit in my pants' look.  I decided to be nice and not forward the bar my shrink's bill so here I am, leaving 1 star too many to the biggest joke of an establishment this side of the Koreas.  The place is beautiful, the design and concept are perfect. However, the staff and management will make you feel like you need to take your purse off the bar just to pee in it because you'll be too scared to get up and go to the washroom (which by the way looks like another realm where spirits crawl into your privates once you take off your pants - my vagina now needs an exorcism).  Had I known I was being deployed to North Korea for the night, I would have at least worn my fatigues. Good luck to all the combatants making their way out there, I hope you make your way back through the bow-tie wearing douchebag employees unscathed.  Never again."}
{"text":"This is one of the \"infamous\" speakeasys of Montreal. Took us a while to figure out where it was (just how a speakeasy should be) and also because there's a restaurant by the same name on the same street just a few blocks down.   The atmosphere - I almost felt like I was in some of a bond movie! Ha! You have a decent selection of cocktails and other drinks."}
{"text":"By posting reviews, more people will find this place and it might lose its speakeasy appeal, but  it's a very cool place.  The door and bar is hard to find and you'll think you're pulling on a door that will be locked, but it will open. You'll walk down a flight of stairs into a flashy Japanese style cocktail bar that almost feels like something you'd see in a movie.  A must try."}
{"text":"Remember when the Temperance Movement succeeded in establishing the repressive policies of prohibition? Do you remember walking through the dead of a winter night in hopes of tracking down a speakeasy that you heard was in existence by sheer word-of-mouth? Ladies and gentleman of Montréal there is one such portal into one such an oasis in our midst. There is a little nondescript red door that is passed by unnoticed by the countess and faceless multitudes. But you, you know something. Beware ye all who cross the threshold beyond this small red door. A passageway with a pay phone; a corridor lined with grey curtains, concrete behind, the infinite at your fingertips. There is a glimmer of light in the distance. Walk there. Walk there and you will see that which you have come for. Pull the curtains aside. Do you see the place where you have arrived? Is that Al Capone drinking Japanese whisky? Enjoy the lights, my friend, for this is but a dream."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails and terrific service. Funky place hidden in plain sight behind a nondescript and graffitied black metal door. The atmosphere and decor only add to the vibe. Don't miss it when in Montreal, better to go closer to opening time to secure a seat."}
{"text":"Contente d'avoir essayé ce petit resto dont tout le monde parle depuis quelque temps....Service un peu lent.. mais l'attente en vaut la peine! Partaagez les plats qui sont en plat principale ou en entrée plutôt que de choisir le spécial \"à partager\". Je vous conseille la soupe ramen, le tatziki au thon et surtout le crispy pork sur riz!!! Le tout d'accompagné d'une bière maison à 4$ :) KANPAII!"}
{"text":"Imaginez que vous vous baladez sur une grande artère, et la au milieu des vitrines et des entrées d'immeubles, une petite porte rouge, un peu passé, vous interpelle. Vous vous approchez et vous pouvez lire en dessous d'un caractère (Japonais I guess) inscrit en tout petit \"Bar\", vous poussez la porte? Of course!  On se retrouve dans un couloir étroit, long de quelques mètres, avec des rideaux lourd et pourpre sur les côtés, en face ... Et lorsque l'on traverse ce rideau c'est juste wahoo! Atmosphère très intimiste, ambiance tamisé - presque clandestine ;-) des cocktails originaux et du whisky japonais - un mélange voluptueux ou il faut aller au moins une fois!   Après, les étoiles en moins, c'est pour le service. A chaque fois que j'y suis allée ça laissait à désirer. Serveurs snobinards et ignorants les clients (tout en restant visiblement inactif). Dommage!"}
{"text":"Literally stumbled on this place while walking down the street checking out the Plateau at night. It's a small, humble black door on a big flashy street with just the words \"BAR\" in Kanji and English in gold in small letters.   Ended up only waiting about 5 minutes (we got there around 9pm on a Friday) and entered a mysterious dark hallway with a red carpet.   It feels like a magical secret club when you enter and are greeted by the rows and rows of candles. The wooden maze that takes up the entire room creates ample room for seating (well. as spacious as a speakeasy can be) with swiveling chairs that help create an intimate setting for two people.   If you come here with a group, don't expect to sit together. It's more likely you will find one empty seat and others will have to stand.  Drink wise, it was tasty! I don't drink so I had the diablo de menthe, which was refreshingly minty. A+ in my book. My boyfriend had some kind of sake cocktail and complained that it barely had any alcohol in it. Still, BIJ was a perfect way to wrap up an accidentally romantic evening.   I'm surprised that my first speakeasy (does this count as one?) experience was in Montreal instead of NYC, but delighted that we were able to get in with no wait."}
{"text":"It's been hard to get in there - failed twice in the past when we were a group of 5-6 and came after 10pm. It surely wants to create an intimate ambiance that's not suitable for big groups. It's also unassuming in a way - not trying to please everyone but to create the right experience for the right people (or anyone maybe but in the right mood).   In addition to what others have talked about, my favorite was the stout especially its head - at the beginning the foam almost takes up the entire glass but you can soon see the dark beer gradually taking over and the foam rising up. Very interesting to see but also the taste won't disappoint if you like chocolate flavored beer."}
{"text":"Something about a hidden bar makes it all that much more special. You can't see it from the outside and when you do get to the door you'll only see one guy who either Lets you in or not.  We arrived 3 of us at first there wasn't any good spots but I noticed a couple leaving and they told me I was able to take their spot by the back which was fantastic. Comfy chairs intimate and u don't have to swivel around to see someone beside you lol.  All the candles are fantastic I'm obsessed with candles so it's the best place to be.  The owner is awesome and a real gem.  I can't wait To return and get myself a bottle that hangs from the ceiling."}
{"text":"I enjoy going there for a date or just to hang out with friends. The atmosphere is great! The drinks are amazing, but a bit pricey.  Its located behind a random black door on St-Laurent, so it might be difficult to find it. Make sure you google map and look at pictures before hand!"}
{"text":"This is was our third time visiting. Always good. Must try - miso ramen & ginger milkshake (yes, you read that right, a milkshake that's ginger flavored. Try it before you shake your head)  service - terrific food - tasty location - good (taxi ride for us)  we'll see you again, soon!"}
{"text":"Unique ambiance and attentive service - would recommend stopping in for a drink or two.  Note that the entrance is a nondescript door off of St. Laurent."}
{"text":"J'adore ce bar! Il est très intime et romantique! Les coctels sont très bons, entre 10-14$. Les serveuses sont un peu serieuses, mais le meilleur du bar c'est l'ambiance. En plus, on est allés un jour où le propriétaire était là, et il passait par tous les tables pour demander si tout allait bien, il a été très gentil. Je le recommande fortement!!"}
{"text":"I definitely wanted this place to be better than it was. The Japanese tapas items weren't bad, but everything was pretty lacklustre, over all. I had the gyoza dumplings, which were decent, and the spicy chicken on rice, which was a big disappointment in terms of spice and flavouring. As far as the decor, the rear of the restaurant is lovely and a nice place to sit if you're in a group, but up-front it's all leftover diner pieces."}
{"text":"Having lived 5 years in Japan, I assert that this place doesn't fit with any of the Land of the Rising Sun's service standards.  First, Big in Japan calls itself a Japanese Brasserie but you can only find two types of beers in the menu: the local draft of \"la maison\" and a can of Asahi (which actually costs $9). More, when I asked if the draft beer was from Japan, the staff (whose glasses' size might compete with her snobbery) gave me the weirdest look ever. Perhaps they weren't aware of their own restaurant's name and type after all.  However, the decor was coherent enough with a 1970s inspired interior mixed with old school Godzilla wallprints. The spots in the back of the room also looked descent for a party of a few.  Despite the contemptuous service, food was good. The menu is pretty rich with very different ingredients but savvy amateurs of Japanese food should reconsider. Indeed, you will find more fusion-oriented dishes than good old Isakaya food.  Moreover, the place opens pretty late and you might enjoy a late snack once you're done partyin' but you should keep at least one $20 bill to fill you hunger.  Overrated and overpriced."}
{"text":"Drinks are simply well prepared. Great place for a date, terrible place for a group. Beautiful room, pro service. I must say that the owner is crazy and probably high on ecstasy. Don't take pictures with flash!"}
{"text":"The whole pace is overhyped. The inside looks good and the service is pro, but the food is incredibly disappointing. There are way better noodle/soup dishes on St Laurent, at more low key restaurants."}
{"text":"Service rapide, serveurs très souriants et attentionnés aux moindres détails, repas excellent ! Le Poké au thon est une découverte ! Riz cuit A la perfection, du poisson frais, une marinade excellente et une petite salade rafraîchissante de roquette d'algues et de câpres. Le mélange est parfait, les assiettes repartent vides ! En boisson je conseille fortement l'épicier du punch si vous êtes 3 ou plus ! Saké gingembre thé vert, une tuerie !"}
{"text":"NEVER ORDER MABO NASU  .... Taste like nothing -_-# The other special is good but *sigh Learned my lesson : be careful when u wanna be ADVENTUROUS  Btw service sucks They can't even let me switch. HAVE TO painfully finish tasteless dishes  Worst noodle I had in my life so far"}
{"text":"I really love the bar big in Japan so I decided to try the restaurant of course !!! There isn't that much space and the decor is nearly not as great so I figured the food would be totally amazing and I was in the mood for a good ramen. To be honest the ramen was a little bland too salty and really not as good as some of the other places I normally go to. The appetizers were all right but nothing amazing. Don't know if I would go back unless the menue was updated"}
{"text":"I really liked the interesting flavours of ramen here. I'm enjoying the cute spots here in Montreal. Can't wait to review more"}
{"text":"This bar has a cool atmosphere and style but the way the bar is run is terrible. I bought a party over of about 20 but not everyone was there yet. They only made a few people go in at a time and made the rest wait for over 30 minutes, so everyone had to leave. The owner (short and stocky half Asian guy with glasses #asshole) was so rude when I politely asked him about the empty seats and if my friends waiting outside could come in, but he immediately raised his voice and got defensive with me. I get that it's first come first serve but He needs to go....  They really need to run this exclusive bar a little better so people aren't waiting outside for that long and be a little nicer to their customers. They should just take reservations if they can't seat people together...how are people supposed to know this ahead of time?  Make sure you call in advance and plan if you are bringing a large party of over 10 people because you may not be able to sit together and you can't walk around and mingle with your friends. It's a very unhappy environment and I don't recommend it for anyone. And beware of that little leprechaun bitch of a manager  Also it was my bday :)  That's all!"}
{"text":"What a great find in Montreal.  The food is unusual, and frankly I am not sure it is authentic Japanese, but frankly with anything this good, it doesn't matter.  There were three of us, and we could really decide which of us made the best choice for a meal.  The beer is good too."}
{"text":"Ambiance agréable, le \" set up \" du bar est hors du commun et le service assez rapide et courtois! Les prix sont un peu élevés mais ça va de soi avec le type de \" bar \". C'est toujours plaisant d'y aller pour jaser avec un petit verre à la main."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is hands down the best in Montreal to get a drink and get cozy! The drinks are on the pricier side, but the atmosphere is well worth it.   Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Hidden , cozy, and comfortable. This non descriptive entrance leads to Kubrick Esque bar with classic cocktails. Menu tends to shy away from modern drinks but if you stick to what they do well. It'll be ok."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place 4 starts but only had one dish, the gyoza, they were good and it came with a small Japanese dressed salad, it was really good, cheap, and at 2:45am was right on the money."}
{"text":"It looks so sketchy on the outside but the inside is gorgeous! Has a nice speakeasy vibe to it which adds a hint of mysteriousness to the whole setting. Atmosphere wise, this place takes the crown hands down.  The dim lit candles makes this bar absolutely perfect for a date. You can find rows and rows of bottles hanging from the ceiling. Even the servers are dressed in dapper tuxedos!  They have a fairly extensive list of drinks and snacks. Worth a second visit!"}
{"text":"One of the first places I found to have ramen.  The cold chuka style ramen is just like what you find it in Tokyo.  In the hot ramen the soup is quite rich and they serve it with an amazing soft boiled egg. A great place for a casual meal by yourself or with a group. They also have big meat dishes served family style, which isn't quite Japanese, but is also very popular.  All the portions  are hearty. So make sure to go there hungry."}
{"text":"I was beyond impressed with Big in Japan. We were visiting Montreal with our aunt and uncle who live part-time in Japan and are always on the lookout for authentic, delicious Japanese food. While the food wasn't 100% authentic, Big in Japan did not disappoint on the deliciousness. The sake cocktails were dangerously good and very bright and light. They went well with the ramen that we all ordered and enjoyed immensely. The waitstaff was super friendly and the service was fast. We will definitely be visiting Big in Japan, and perhaps their other bar down the street, during our next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Needs a better selection of Japanese single malt whiskeys. Even with that it is a nice place to be."}
{"text":"A perfect, elegant yet hidden gem in the heart of the plateau. This bar offers a great place to sit and chat with a relaxed ambience, candle lit tables and soft music. Truly a perfect place to go for a night cap. Loved the hanging bottles storage idea as well for those who want to buy a whole bottle, leave it there and return to continue drinking from their bottle."}
{"text":"Not in Japan, not very big. Crowded, even. But the food is definitely Japanese-inspired and the servings are decidedly big.  It was a bustling place and our waitress was incredible - fluidly moving around the crowded dining space and taking care of the other diners. The large open front window let fresh air in, which countered the tight conditions inside.  The miso ramen is delicious! A rich broth with tasty vegetables and lots of noodles. A very good deal and quite filling. My wife got the Hiyashi Chuka which had a light but flavorful broth and she opted for vegetable tempura as a topping which was so good! There was also a hefty portion of delicious strips of tofu mixed in. The soft-boiled eggs on both dishes were a surprise, but were cooked well. We ended up taking some home because it was so filling!  We both had \"sake slush\" drinks, which my wife found quite tasty. Careful, they're more potent than they look!  Definitely worth a try; when you're on the Main, drop in to Big in Japan!"}
{"text":"This place was fun; I think it may have been more fun to find though. My boyfriend and I got to big in Japan around 9pm on a Friday and there were plenty of seats open. We tried the Tuna Tataki which melts in your mouth but is smaller than expected from looking at the pictures.  We each got a drink;I had a glass of wine and my boyfriend had a beer. It is a small space and not a place I would hang out all night but seems like the perfect place to meet for a drink or two before moving to the next establishment. In the short time we were there (less than an hour) The place was completely full. My advice is to come a little early to beat the crowd."}
{"text":"Wanna win that special someone's heart over? The dim lights and cozy ambiance makes it perfect to get close and personal. Short list of drinks which makes it very easy to decide what you want. Service is impeccable, quick, professional and overall love what big in Japan is going for. I highly recommend going to big in Japan for a date or catching up with a gf."}
{"text":"I m quite confused when I ended up here early than planned, after an afternoon of drinking and evening of debauchery.  It was still a civilized time of night, and here I am a little worse for wear.  And I realize this would be the perfect place to get me some drunk Japanese food that it is not yakitori.  There is a cheap beer choice and the usual Japanese name brand beers, I off course choose the cheap beer choice because the price difference was significant and I was not in the shape to be a beer snob.  When I got my bowl of rice with pork belly in it I was devouring it up, the sauce was too concentrated for me, the sauce was too salty, the cabbage and rice was a nice complement.  In the middle of my not so sober state with sauce and rice hanging on my chopstick, I looked up and realized that this place had like people on dates and people on regular social outings.  I personally wouldn't do the whole dates thing here because the food is not that awesome, and the $$ I paid was a little more than the usual amount I would pay for to fill my stomach after an afternoon of drinking."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you must see if you are in Montreal. Get ready to wait in line (30m+ on busy nights) and get psychologically abused by the bouncer especially if it's cold outside, but you will be rewarded with one of the most interesting layouts and decor you've ever seen of a bar. Nice cocktail list and I wanted to try some snacks, but we were pretty beat up from chinatown.  Diverse crowd and a bit upscale, so don't come in here if you are looking ratty."}
{"text":"Bon, pas cher, et grosses assiettes !!!!  Nous avons pris les ravioles au boeuf et la viande panée en entrée. Et en plat, une soupe ramen et un plat de pates et de viande. Un régal pour tout !! Et les quantités sont énormes !! Ca nous aura fait le repas du lendemain midi aussi :)"}
{"text":"Bar was fine, speak easy feel to it.  But staff was very rude.  I think that she did not like the fact that we spoke English.  She literally threw the bill at us."}
{"text":"My fiancé and another couple visited on 12/30. We had reservations made for us by our hotel and were a little skeptical at first sight. The entrance was hard to find, but that all played into the mystique and ambiance of the place. Once we found the door and made our way in we were greeted by the hostess and taken to a table right by the bar. André the owner came over to personally greet us. He made it a point to walk us through the selections and even had a hard-to-find Japanese whiskey that I hardly ever find in the states. Honestly, André spoiled us with his attention to detail and kind manners; the server we were assigned was not as attentive as he was but that is by no means a complaint. Seriously check this place out and find a potential new favorite."}
{"text":"Affordable, generous and well seasoned recipes from the land of the rising sun :) A unique place in Montreal"}
{"text":"Big in Japan is a perfect representation of a classy Japanese whiskey bar. I love the hanging whiskey bottles that you can save if you are a regular here and the design of it all is sexy, romantic, and just makes you want to have a good time. They do have limited small bites to accompany your cocktails and whiskeys. Great for small groups or dates only. Don't expect a night of debauchery here.   The speakeasy feel in seeing why there is a line in front of an unmarked door just makes everything that much more exciting. (especially if you are bringing a date!)  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Very classy bar. The servers are very well dressed and the drinks are exquisite. It's the strangest place; it's hidden from the street but don't let the shady corridor leading to the bar scare you. At the end of the tunnel, you will be shocked!  The decor is beautiful too. Great place!"}
{"text":"It was pretty late on a Thursday night and we were glad this restaurant was will open.   I gifted myself with their tuna tataki on rice. It was amazingly good. The portion was big enough to get me bloated haha  Service was good too.   I would come back again to try their other meals!"}
{"text":"À essayer! Très spécial comme ambiance. Il y a comme un grand comptoir qui fait le tour du bar. Il y a bien sûr beaucoup de boissons alcoolisées japonaises.   Une atmosphère autant pour les dates que pour les groupes."}
{"text":"My sandwich was fantastic, but I found the service was a little slow.   Also, if you're seated in the middle and it's cold outside (like we were), every time the door opens you will feel like an arctic blast washing over you. They wouldn't move us to an empty table away from the door, because it was apparently reserved. Although it appeared to us that the table in question was later occupied by walk-in customers.  Again, the food was very good. I think the prices are a little high, but that's what you get in this location."}
{"text":"nice place. plus it's open til 3am! :) had crispy chicken on rice (with special sauce on it!)-- was probably the best japanese food i had by far. didn't find the ramen that good, but I never really had a thing for ramen even before.. the waitress said it's one of the good ones though. will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The nondescript sign on the door has two japanese characters that read \"sakaba\" which means tavern. We stumbled upon it while grabbing obscene amounts of poutine next door at Patati Patata. The interior layout of this cocktail bar is impressive, except for the dive-bar bathroom in the back. We went around 9 on a Saturday night in January and it wasn't jammed."}
{"text":"Worst experience I ever had in Montreal, as always in weekdays they are busy we waited for 30minutes and upon arriving inside we came to know they only had 2 seats and we were 3 people to be seated as a employee came to us and said either you two guys can sit and one can stand or check other bars for 3 seats, which is ridiculous offensive to any pub or bar.I would have rated -ve as review."}
{"text":"Great drinks, nice ambiance, hard to find location. Try the tuna tataki or the chips and salsa. Both are surprisingly delicious!"}
{"text":"Super cool comme endroit, j'ai vraiment adoré! L'ambiance est super relaxe, la bouffe est pas chère et vraiment excellente, les serveurs sont sur la coche. J'y ai été un vendredi soir avec un petit groupe d'ami, c'était parfait. On a commandé plein d'entrées (les gyozas sont excellents), de la bière (pas super bonne, mais je suis un peu difficile), des drinks à base de saké et de thé vert, des milkshakes, et des plats principaux qui ont ravi tout le monde. Mon préféré: le porc croustillant, trop miam!  Un gros coup de coeur pour cet izakaya à la déco vintage!"}
{"text":"First of all, if you were looking for authentic Japanese food this is not the place. It's a tiny spot with a nice cozy atmosphere, had to wait a bit but there were a waiting area. The decor is interesting, with some classic Japanese stuff near the washrooms. Behind the paper decor, the light box used was actually a poutine menu, kinda funny.  Anyways, service speed was decent and our server explained to us what the food was.  We started with a pork bun. The sauce was on the bottom of the plate, which soaked into the buns, making it hard to pick up to eat without touching the sticky sauce. Anyways it was delicious. Next, I got the vegetable udon with extra pork. Okay, I am a sucker for good udon so I had really high hopes. However, it was rather disappointing. First, it was FULL of herbs like parsley and cilantro that was overpowering and made no sense in the udon. All I can think is that the meat might've gone bad so they tried to cover up the taste? Second, the baby bok choy was not washed properly so I had to suffer many bites of crunchy soil and sand. Except for the udon noodles itself, tofu, egg and meat, the udon was not authentic at all.  We also got the black sesame milkshake, which was delicious and decently sized.  Everything was pretty decent so I'd say this review could've been three stars. I think I've just chosen the wrong main."}
{"text":"Our 1st experience here was great! the green tea ribs was tender and I even liked the cabbage that came with it.   The second time we were here, the waiter suggested their new and `experimental` hotpot, which were pieces of tofu, meat, veggies with the same brown soy colour and taste. Did not enjoy that although I guess it was `experimental`.   Love the concept and decor here, very unique and apparently authentic of what they have in Japan. We had the same waiter both times ( think he is the owner?) very knowledgeable, and enthusiastic."}
{"text":"We ordered Gyozas as a starter. To our surprise we saw one of the chefs taking out a bag of store-bought frozen gyozas. What the fuck. Sadly the said store-bought Gyozas were the highlight of the meal!   Miso ramen I ordered looked good with two pieces of cha-siu, some menma and a whole soft-boiled egg. Pretty authentic, i thought. Good things first, cha-siu was decent so was the egg. Also noodles had a good pull but broth lacked depth and tasted like a crappy miso soup anyone can make at home.   My buddy's miso katsudon was just panko-encrusted deep fried pork on top of rice. No egg, no onion, no soy sauce-based broth. Technically it shouldn't be called katsu \"don\" at all. Them again this is called \"miso\" katsudon (which I have never tried) so I might be wrong?  This is the second time I was at Big in Japan. I was there when they first opened in 2007 and wasn't impressed then. Well I wasn't impressed tonight either. Was this place really featured in the Montreal episode of Anthony Bourdain's new show? How embarrassing."}
{"text":"I got take-out and everything was superb, from the 5-minute wait to even the quality of the containers. The portion sizes are very large, and the noodles in the miso ramen were perfectly chewy. If you are dining in, beware the restaurant is rather small and crowded, but it's well worth the possibility of a little wait"}
{"text":"If you can get your head around the mild level of pretentiousness, this is a pretty nice bar.  Rising from the ashes of what was once Main Street, Big in Japan has given new life to that old red door on St. Laurent Boulevard.  Once you get inside you're greeted by 1000 Candles. The decor is very nouveau trendy. The whole place is a giant bar. It slightly resembles Pullman in the layouts of the bar and bartenders area. It's very easy to strike up a conversation with the people around you.  I went on a casual Tuesday evening. I would recommend it myself. Yet I have no idea what to expect on a Friday or Saturday. It certainly has the potential to be a madhouse in there."}
{"text":"My favourite bar in Mtl. Worth the wait. The manager is such an amazing guy. He definitely is an added value to the bar. He intervened and got rid of this guy who would not leave my friend and I alone (even after we asked him to) and then came over to apologize and explain to us that it was not the ambiance that the bar wanted to host. Drinks were on the bar yay!!! One of the rare places where tipping is a pleasure."}
{"text":"So embarrassingly bad I feel obligated to leave my first Yelp review in years!  The manager (owner?) is a total douche. Was hostile right off the bat, condescending and clearly trying to compensate for a miserable life at home. 3 minutes after interacting with this sad individual, our party of 7 decided to walk out before even ordering a single drink.  Do yourself a favor and find another bar to have a good time."}
{"text":"Tuna tataki, best choice, hands down. It's fresh and raw on the inside, and cooked crispy on the outside. Comes with a really delicious salad and rice filler.  I also tried the beef-tofu-eggplant-ramen noodle dish, but I'm pretty sure it was packed with MSG, it was so salty and in the Unnaturally Extreme Flavour category.  I also tried, for the first time, unfiltered sake, which is like alcoholic rice milk. Really yummy! My partner had their somewhat well-known ginger beer, which is a beer with fresh grated ginger added in a shandy-like bevvie that is pretty tasty and refreshing. Both those drinks are a win, but I'm also interested in trying that black sesame milkshake.  Wait times are not long at all - we got a table right away but they don't take reservations because wait times don't often go past ten minutes and you can have a drink while you wait (so civilized).  The menu has a limited number of choices so you don't take forever to decide. The décor is *well-loved* but comfortable.  Their wait staff is comme ci, comme ça - one of our dinner companions didn't get her dish until well after the rest of us had devoured our first plate, which seemed quite poorly coordinated, and when her dish did come, it was the wrong order... so maybe rack that up to a little Friday night chaos.  Let's not confuse the Big in Japan restaurant with the Big in Japan bar, which is a different establishment, quite a few doors down St Laurent. That's where I'll check out next!"}
{"text":"Holy crap where do I start? On business ended up here for dinner. Started at the unmarked door and ended up at the open air spot. Had the Kimchi biru, edamame, and finished with the Mabo Nasu. Every bight was beyond epic, thank you to the staff of servers that Made the night more enjoyable. Sat beside the kitchen and watched the crew kick it. Solid. Not an expert by any means but for my night a solid night - thanks to the unmarked door crew and open air crew was a solid experience. Kimchi for the win. Mabo Nasu - right bite."}
{"text":"Amazing concept, worth the wait if there is one (usually is on the weekends, late at night) Absolutely stunning atmosphere, amazing bar setup probably the only place in the city with that big of a Japanese whisky selection.   Anyone who  thinks it's over priced and pretentious can't appreciate a good cocktail and should probably leave anyway ; so people who aren't just looking for a spot to get drunk cheap and fast won't have to wait in line so long.   It is hardly pretentious which is something I love about it, you could have someone in a three  piece  suit and next to them  someone in plaid and a toque-  only dresscode is  turn down the irony  a notch.  The design  is welcoming and stimulating nouveau with a slight  edge so it's a fit whichever way you  spin it.  Don't let the tuxedo scare you away.   There are absinthe fountains and this is one of the few places with a crowd that can appreciate the art of the absinthe ceremony, I really appreciate people who actually know their spirits.   Aside from the awesome  Japanese whisky bottles that people own hanging from the cieling,  the beer comes in large unmarked  bottles which has a nice novelty  factor. Hendrick's  gin and tonic comes in a glass with  a cucumber on it. It's these little things that make for great conversation  and really make the experience.  The only reason why it get's 4/5  stars is the bathroom. Its freezing and boring, it just doesn't match the place so it takes away from the experience but I imagine that will be worked on soon.  The impressive ambiance is a guarantee to  get you laid- great  date spot-  great  whisk(e)y  lineup."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, went there for the first time around midnight but the food was tasty.   Fried dumplings, spicy ramen noodles and some saké were a perfect combination.  I'd go back there at anytime! Service was good as well, highly recommend to try this place out."}
{"text":"Great speakeasy with lots of Japanese whiskey's and other libations. Also it kind of looks like it could be a set for a David Lynch movie."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in the city. I love the sketchy vibe from the outdoors and as you walk-in you're shocked at how gorgeous and classy it is. It's a pleasant surprise every time i go. It reminds me of NYC's Lower East Side bars off of a sketchy backstreet. Drinks are delicious but on the pricier side. It's the perfect date spot."}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times and the last time was the worst out of all. I would not come back here. Food is horrible and so is the service. The least authentic Japanese spot in Montreal."}
{"text":"Big in Japan bar is a bit difficult to find for the first time, it's sort of just this hidden door in a wall between two other stores, but once inside, it's gorgeous! From the candle lined tables to the glass walls, to the bottles of whiskey overhead it really has a great environment and ambiance. It is a bit like a speak-easy bar, which is nice to go have a drink with friends or to go on a date without having to yell at anyone to be heard!   The cocktails are also delicious, a bit on the pricey side, and watching the bartenders create these brilliant concoctions is always fun!   It's pretty popular so expect to wait in line, BUT if you don't want to wait, go on a weekday (Mon-Tues-Wed) there was never a line. And it is not weird to go to a bar early in the week.... ..."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS  It breaks my heart to give this place a lower review than what it should get but sadly I have no choice.  I'll explain my reason in a minute.  First this bar is a bit hard to find - the outside it a graffiti door that looks like you might enter a murderer's lair.  But fear not because when you open it and walk through you are transported to something that is magical.  Dimly lit, candle lights all over the bar and whiskey bottles suspended from the ceiling give it that sexy and intimate vibe.  Great for a date, or just chilling with a few friends.  It's cool to be let in on the secret of this place :)  The menu is simple with a few selections of whiskey, cocktails and drinks celebrating Japan.  My friend and I each tried different whiskeys and then I also had the Pomme Cannelle.  This was so light a fresh - absolutely delicious with just a hint of cinnamon.  I was impressed.  The vibe and the decor are really cool and I would love to come here again, and to be honest I probably would come back because I just feel so sophisticated and cool here.  However here is my reason for the lower rating:  Firstly I wanted to take some pictures of inside the bar.  My phone automatically set to flash and it went off.  The server immediately came over and informed me that I could take pictures but not with a flash.  That's totally fine with me....except several other people inside the bar were taking pics and I saw their flash go off....but none of them were spoken to.  Hmmmm  Then I got a call so I had the phone to my ear listening to my VM.  It was done discreetly.  But then again the server came over and said that wasn't allowed and shook his finger at me (like no no no).  Once again if you can't be on your phone in here that is fine if that is the rule... but once again I saw someone else on their phone and they weren't spoken to.  At this point the server took away our menus....we felt a bit awkward...like we got drink blocked!   We just paid and left after that.  My friend and I felt that we weren't treated the same as the other patrons in the bar.  We're fine with the rules but they need to apply to everyone.    I totally understand that if they want this place to be more of a finer establishment with no flash/no phone rule I am fine with that.  They want to cater to a more upscale experience.  I get it.  But perhaps they should have said something to the guy who came in wearing one of those baseball tshirts and sneakers because I am sure he brought down the classiness of the place far more than I did!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Drinks were pretty good.  The ONLY reason I did not give this place 5 stars is because the bathroom was disgusting."}
{"text":"I got the curry udon. My friend got the same. My other friend got the rice with pork cutlet. The curry udon was filled with sauce/ broth. Way too much in my opinion. There was way more sauce than noodle. Also, you had to pay like 6 dollars to add meat to this dish, which I think is kind of a rip off. It was already expensive and without it, it would have basically been a bowl of sauce with some noodles and a couple vegetables. The food wasn't bad. It tasted good. I think it would have been better if I had gotten the rice and cutlet. It was piled high. Also, the staff were nice. This place has kind of a hipster vibe."}
{"text":"Nous somme aller dans ce restau car on m'avait dit que les plats étaient très bon. Effectivement j'ai pu constater cela. Bonne ambiance et plats top surtout les tataki de thon. Dommage qu'on ai dû attendre près de 45 min avant d'être servi (bon ok on était vendredi soir..). Je recommande quand même mais venez pas trop tard surtout en week end"}
{"text":"This is a bar worth hunting down (and you will need to hunt to find the mystery door) purely for the interior decoration. The service is charming and unobtrusive, perfect for date night or a quiet catch up with friends. The cocktails are inspired and the food menu is perfect for pre dinner snacks. But what really set Big In Japan apart for me was the way the long bar table  snaked around the room, creating a multitude of little nooks and \"sections\" that created a beautiful sense of privacy between groups. Super impressed."}
{"text":"I had miso ramen there. The bamboo shoot doesnt look fresh and the bottom of the soup tastes like sand."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Anthony Bourdain, and when he visited Big in Japan while shooting for The Layover- Montreal, I added this restaurant to my \"Must try\" list.  Big in Japan has two locations. The Big in Japan Bar which is on St Laurent & Rachel and then Big in Japan, the restaurant on St Laurent & Pine. I'm talkin about the restaurant. The places looks more like a diner  with Japanese scrolls hangin down the wall. Service is quick and very friendly. One thing to keep in mind, this is not an authetic Japanese joint. Its Japanese fusion cusine. The food is interesting. Liked the curry braised pork. The green tea braised veal cheek was good too. The soy chicken wings are ok. Also pass on the chicken neck. Dunno why they have it on their menu. The Mibo Nasu & Miso ramen are massive.  Portions are HUGE and if you are someone who counts calories, you rather skip. This place won't satisfy your craving for authentic Japanese food. For that there's Imadake / Kazu.  But what Big in Japan promises is that you'll be atleast a size bigger once you stuff your face with this interesting Jap Fusion food.  Food -  Good Service - Fast & friendly Ambiance - Casual Worth the money -Hai"}
{"text":"Don't let that non-descriptive door with no signage other than the small Japanese characters stop you. It is like Alice stepping through the door to Wonderland. The corridor leads you to a sophisticated dimly lit candle bar. The mellow ambiance was intimate and welcoming. The service on point. The variety of drinks from whiskey to mixed drinks are excellent.  The service is also on point. It was a carousel of musical napkin change. While I certainly understand moist napkins under drinks but I wonder the cost of paper napkins at this place. Aside that this 'secret' lounge bar is relax date spot. The drinks are well done and some light bar food if you want something along with your drink. Although you are certainly to impress that date with a gin fizz and a side of kim chi...er maybe not."}
{"text":"I loved this bar. It was beautifully laid out, could accommodate a large group of 8. It had only 2 kinds of Japanese scotch, but really how many do you need? There was no line when we arrived on a Saturday at 9, so that was good timing for us.   A beautiful atmosphere and I hope to return when I get back to Montreal."}
{"text":"A very mellow and classy bar. The servers were in bow tie!!! When you walk in, the 'velvety' curtain drapes screams: 'oh my, you've found this little gem tucked away in such a busy street', opens up to the bar.   The bar set-up modifies after traditional ramen tables; it curves in/out to provide the staff easy access to the patrons. Service was pleasant. However, i wish the servers explained the set up of the whiskies (even though I've read about it)    Tokyo mule: delightful drink with a sweet gingery honey kick at the end. Not the traditional mules served in a steel cup though. Also, the cups were not glass (which I was expecting, considering the decor and the ambiance they were trying to portray).    Tuna tataki: great thick tuna slices with a light salad on the side. The sauce was delicious too! Great dish overall to snack on.   Great date place to start the night, or end the night if you're feelin' grand. Very romantic and classy!"}
{"text":"Super endroit pour une sortie en amoureux. C'est un concept bien particulier, tamisé,  feutré,  branché, bonne musique. Ils y servent aussi de bons petits plats."}
{"text":"The place is interesting, the music is nice but doesn't correspond with the theme (music: American rock) it would've more suited for this place to be a dinner due to its configuration and the tunes they blast.  Food wise, okay ish, lots of salad in the dishes kinda feel like it's cover up which is to bad because less is more.  Nice staff, but yeah the food is not that amazing but for the price it's reasonable"}
{"text":"Awesome tucked away bar in Montreal. Great Japanese whisky menu and top notch service. Highly recommend, seemed better for small groups than big as it's a pretty small space."}
{"text":"Warmth. It's probably the strongest word I can give to this bar. Going through a nondescript door into a small hallway and introduced to a cozy room blanketed with soft lights and impressive counters. Here is a place to bring a date and speak softly while getting closer.   Unfortunately though I stumbled in here 4 drinks deep and with my friends all we wanted was another excuse to keep drinking. It was our stop along St. Laurent's many bars and this bar certainly helped.   The design and decor of the place allowed us to mellow out and begin to relax and enjoy the bottle of Sake we ordered. Nothing crazy to do here but to sit back and enjoy a wonderful time with your friends and be a little classy. If only we had dressed up a bit more that would've been good to get the overall feeling they might have wanted. It looks like when we went they no longer had a focus on food which is a shame seeing the pictures looks like they do a wonderful job. Otherwise it's still noteworthy place."}
{"text":"We had come here after going to the Bar Big in Japan. This has the direct opposite vibe and was more to our tune. We were seated by the kitchen and right next to the manager. He was helpful in providing us recommendations and was willing to share a couple of wonderful stories of the chefs that have strolled in here.   We got a Sake cocktail in a pitcher, we slammed these right down along with edamame while we waited for our main event: the Tori Chicken. 1 whole chicken (yes), on a bed of curry rice (Yes), Soy glazed wings on the side (Yes!), and finished off with some root vegetables and a perfectly cooked egg dripping down on our chicken (YES). Safe to say it was perfect and we loved it.     While dining the owner also appeared and was watching the team work together. He was respectful to them and congratulating him he extended to all those who made it possible. That's respect!"}
{"text":"Tip: this bar is behind a red door at 4175 St Laurent, it's NOT located at 3723 St Laurent (which is the sister restaurant).  Anyway, we were in search of an exceptional Montreal bar/speakeasy.....and sadly we did not find it here. Inside is a very unique layout that, personally, I was not a fan of. The whole room is one winding bar (i didn't take a picture but I'm sure you can find one on Yelp) with interesting lighting and whiskeys hanging down from the ceiling.  Since we were seated at the far end of the winding bar, and since there only appeared to be one bartender, the service was way too slow. But the Manhattans we ordered (with fancy whiskeys, natch) were pretty good I guess.  All in all, underwhelming."}
{"text":"Superbe bar, très inattendu. Cela fait longtemps que j'attendais une bonne occasion pour pouvoir y aller. C'est dans le cadre de retrouvailles avec des amis que j'y suis enfin allé. Même si nous étions un lundi soir, il y avait quelques personnes. L'endroit est superbe et offre une très très bonne impression en retrant. Le service est courtois et cordial. Les cocktails et le sake sont très bons. Mon ami a particulièrement aimé le kimchi. Un très très bel endroit que j'espère fréquenter plus souvent."}
{"text":"Méchant beau bar qui se veut un speakeasy japonais avec une belle carte de cocktails et de petits plats de service. On y rentre et l'éclairage et la musique nous rappel un temps où l'élégance était de mise, alors on se laisse bercer par les classiques du blues, jazz et les grands chansonniers français et belges. L'espace est divisée de manière à créer une certaine intimité, tout en étant ouvert et visible par tous - comme pour satisfaire notre besoin d'observation avec l'entente que se qui se passe ici, reste ici. C'est fabuleux.   Pour les amateurs de whiskies, vous pouvez y acheter une bouteille à vous et la laisser avec le bar, où ils la viseront au plafond, afin que vous puissiez y puiser lors de vos prochaines visites.   bref, une place que se classe probablement dans mon top 5 de places où aller sur une date intime evec votre petit-e ami-e!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to visit Big in Japan after reading all of the positive reviews. I agree that the ambiance is incredible. However, the drinks were ridiculously overpriced. We ordered shochu and plum wine, and the bartender only gave us like 2 cm of the drink and ten ice cubes! Overall, I thought it was pretentious and overhyped. We left in about 30 min to explore other bars in the area."}
{"text":"I went to big in japan bar last night with a friend. We waited 25 minutes for a menu, another 20 minutes to place an order and then 10 minutes later my friend's drink was served and I waited ANOTHER 10 for my drink. Everyone I could see was waiting for drinks. This place gets good reviews because of the decor / concept which are great but when I go out for a drink I don't want to spend over an hour waiting for it. We were prepared to spend a lot of money there unfortunately there isn't enough time in the world to spend money at big in japan bar. Not to mention the service was extremely rude (but even that I can overlook if I'm getting timely service at least)."}
{"text":"Excellent whiskey selection and reasonably priced considering the classy setting. Can be crowded on weekends, but week days are good to go! One hell of a choice for a first date.   The bar is hard to find, look for the hidden red door corner of saint-laurent and rachel."}
{"text":"Decor : This place is very trendy, minimalist decor (which I like) and has a lot character. A hidden gem.   Food/Drinks : Drink selection is good and the snacks are good (I liked the tuna sashimi very much).  Service : I must say that the staff is very stuck up. I had friends from Europe and the tab was quite a large one. They were rude to myself and other people from my group and I personally think that that alone would keep me from going back or bringing anyone there.   * I must however add that the brunette with the glasses was very nice (nothing outstanding but at least polite) . She is the only exception."}
{"text":"Cool little place, and certainly easy enough to find. Drink menu is short, but trendy and pretty delicious cocktails. It was pretty quiet at 7pm, and I imagine when it gets going, it can be a really fun place. Service is not what I would call friendly, but was prompt. Would go back! (Suggestion: the chairs at the back of the bar are absolutely mangled while everything else is pretty pristine. I can't figure this out, but would recommend to management to consider a fix)"}
{"text":"For years, I didn't know this bar existed. Then, I started to hear rumblings of a gem tucked away behind a nondescript door somewhere in the Plateau. I never thought much of it - I figured it would be just another dive on St Laurent. Was I ever wrong.   Walking into Big in Japan is truly a magical experience. The continuous glass bar, the intimate lighting, the rough-hewn concrete walls draped in elegant curtains... I never want to get another drink anywhere else. The cocktails are delicious and there's a large selection of other booze if you prefer something fancy neat or on the rocks.   The wait can be long during peak bar hours, but it's completely worth it. I do not recommend going here with a large group - Big in Japan is definitely more suited for intimate gatherings (think a nice date or a friend you've not seen in a long time)."}
{"text":"This place is done speak-easy style so expect to stand on a line outside of a hidden door. But that said, it has a nice ambiance and lighting and would probably make for a great date night out if you're looking for that sort of intimate, dark corner feel.  Oh. Except for that manager / owner dude who is rude AF to his staff. Like goddamn, this dude can not stop making the lamest sarcastic remakes to everybody around him 24/7. It's really weird. Like you get the sense he thinks he's coming off as powerful but in reality he comes across as just desperate for a reality TV gig. Like maybe he wants somebody to bring a hidden camera and make him go viral for being obnoxious to his staff and drum up business that way. It's that purposeful and out of place. I went with some friends and we literally couldn't carry on a normal conversation because we were all awe-struck by how obnoxious this dude was. His staff are REALLY friendly and competent, so why does every sentence out of his mouth have to be these over-the-top patronizing \"hey is for HORSES\" kind of lines? It's just so, so weird. And it definitely ruins the mood and makes what initially feels exclusive feel more like just a bunch of empty wine bottles and concrete with your grandmother's drapes all hung around it.  That said, the drinks were incredibly reasonably priced (coming from New York I appreciated THAT much) and tasted great. So I'm mixed. It's not a bad place, but I guess try and avoid the owner."}
{"text":"Coin sympa pour prendre un verre, plus entre amoureux que entre copain mais pourquoi pas pour la 2ème solution ! Pour l'ambiance, je vous conseille de regarder les photos, ca parle facilement ;) Les 2 cocktails que nous avions pris étaient très bons. Le mien au rhum et cassis était très bien dosé ! Le service est impeccable, très attentionné et les serveurs sont tout mignons dans leur uniforme. Les prix sont dans la normale pour un bar à cocktail. Je reviendrais pour un verre en mode posé :)"}
{"text":"Everything was over-salty and the mayo on the rice bowls was too rich, overwhelming the rest of the flavors. Prices are too high for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is literally a diamond. I get bored of always going to the same spots, and this one is the one that is different. If you want to bring a girl, I would say there is no better place. Don't serve her wine or beer, you are in a Sake place, go for it. It's exiting, not only the alcohol, but your taste buds will go crazy. And your mind too :)   I digg everything about this place and i go there often.  Very very trendy in the moment, you'll find a lot of 'hipsters' and people looking like they live on an other planet. You'll have a lot of things to say to the girl in front of you, if not, well you are boring :)"}
{"text":"Cool!  The negatives of this place are reserved for getting in the door and finding a space. On a busy summer evening, you will wait in a stifling corridor with no air circulation. Once you are allowed through the door by the less-than-pleasant doorman, you are not directed to any particular seat, but must find your way around the labyrinth to a suitably vacant place to sit or stand.  At first, I was really annoyed by all this. However, as my party found a place, the service was really nice and the atmosphere quickly grew on us.  We ordered a few cocktails, then ended the evening with a large punch bowl cocktail. The prices were reasonable for a nicer place, and the drinks were well above average.  The best part of the visit was the music, oddly enough. Big in Japan Bar plays some of the greatest mix of tunes ever.  If you are aware of the wait and a bit of initial snobbery getting in the door, you will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Super découverte par hasard! Les plats sont délicieux et le service bien sympa. Nous y retournerons c'est certain."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick bite at this spot on the main one late afternoon and unfortunately was disappointed. The venue itself was dark and dated and could really use a facelift. The service was okay; maybe it was the time of day but seeing the venue only had four customers, I would think that our order would have been taken and come around faster. Also, they had run out of some of the ingredients so we couldn't enjoy the bao buns we were hoping to get. Started with the edamame which were nicely seasoned although they could use a little punch besides salt. The fried dumplings were awesome though! The prices and portions are fair so it would be great for sharing."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. You come here to impress someone. Love the allure of trying to find this cocktail lounge (this place is NOT a bar) behind an unmarked black door. When you walk in, you are transformed into another world.  There are candles everywhere which sets the mood for a date. I love the decor, the vibe, the drinks and the fact you can buy an expensive exclusive Japanese whiskey that hangs from the ceiling. Super cool.   The service is excellent here. They know what they are talking about. You should know what you are talking about when you come here because they will ask you very specific questions about your cocktail order.  Very impressive cocktail lounge and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Belle endroit  très bien caché. Sur la porte ça ne montre pas l'adresse .Cela ressemble  à un logement abandonné. Quand on rentre  l'aspect  est  très chic et élégant.C'est pas pratique  si on vient  avec un  grand groupe de personnes , car c'est un  petit   bar . Le service est bon .  Mon cocktail  était savoureux . Il n'y avait pas assez d'éclairage  , car  la lumière  était  tamisée   dans l'endroit où on nous avait placé mes amis et moi ce qui fait que mes photos sont un peu  sombre . J'y retournerait  c'est sûr !"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short ... You wait in line for nothing The door man is a puny pretentious brat who puts on a fake British accent  The manager/owner looks like a pissed off Asian version of Cartman who REALLY needs to lay off the cheese puffs. The vibes are super cold, the staff doesn't smile or greet you, instead they'll tell you to take your purse off the table and to not lose your table number (a stupid card they put on your table) or they would charge you 10$ And for the love of god - don't let the flash go off on your phone or you'll get kicked out.  Yes, it is beautifully designed, but unfortunately for big in japan, that's not all it takes to run a great spot.  Very very uncomfortable experience"}
{"text":"The tuna tataki here is one of my favourite things to eat, and at 22 servings for $65 the giant punch bowls are a great way to celebrate life. Bonus fun: go read the graffiti on the back wall from back in the day when this joint was one of the sketchiest drug dealer bars in the city."}
{"text":"Ambiance is unbeatable. The whole scene from finding the little tucked away door to the lighting to the bottles hanging from the ceiling. Stick with a straight up whiskey drink though. We got a couple of the cocktails that were a little sweet and it wasn't until we switched to the Old Fashioned that we felt the kick of booze. Pretty amazing experience- albeit a little pricey."}
{"text":"We just happened to wander into this speakeasy last summer during our first trip to Montreal. It was like walking through the wardrobe into a magical Narnia for adults. Dim lights hung from the ceiling all over the room. The drinks were amazing and the music was great. They don't allow flash photography as to not ruin the intimate vibe. The waiters all wore dress shirts and bowties.I definitely recommend this place it's romantic and truly special, perfect for a date night with your s.o."}
{"text":"****This review is for Big in Japan BAR  The place was everything I had hoped for! Absolutely beautiful decor, not too loud, fairly quick service and a simple menu. We had the tuna tatiki and it was absolutely incredible (and considering the price you've got to try it). Our drinks were tasty but over priced, however we did take some of the higher end cocktails.   This is a great first-date spot or client meeting. Candle lit and overall very intimate. Be careful going with a group as it is dedicated seats meaning you may be forced to split up."}
{"text":"Veuillez noter que cette page Yelp est pour le bar speakeasy Big in Japan. Le restaurant Big in Japan est sur la même rue (environ à 8 minutes de marche).   Pour s'y rendre, il faut trouver la fameuse porte. La vibe du speakeasy est vraiment cool et intime. À chacune de mes visites, j'étais servie par un barman très sympathique et les cocktails étaient incroyable. Je recommande fortement pour une date à deux."}
{"text":"Vous ne pouvez pas vous tromper avec le porc ou poulet croustillant sur riz. Et n'oubliez pas les pains vapeurs en entrée!  Big in Japan est le genre d'endroit ou j'aime prendre une bouchée en fin de soirée."}
{"text":"We love a secret bar!!  This place does not disappoint.  We were in Montreal for my friend's birthday weekend.  It was four girls with a mission to eat and drink our way through Montreal.  Thankfully this place is open on Sunday nights.  What a great way to end the weekend!  Even though its dark and sexy its still fun for people who aren't on a date.  We enjoyed the stylish atmosphere, the friendly staff, but most of all, the food and drink.  We wanted some snacks and tried a few things.  We loved the tuna so much that we got it twice!  The cocktails are well made.  The only thing that was puzzling was that card that they give you.  I'm not sure what its for.  Maybe if its busier it makes sense? If I return to Montreal I will definitely make time to visit this bar again."}
{"text":"Good ambiance, horrible staff and management! AVOID!!!! We will not be returning to this place. I would rate zero stars if I could!  Tried to give feedback to the manager, he was defensive, rude and walked away. AVOID!!  Check out Coldroom instead! Friendlier staff!"}
{"text":"Ce bar est vraiment excellent pour y aller en tête à tête. Ambiance tamisée à la bougie. Musique rétro et Lounge, cocktails de qualités. Sans oublier le fait que le bar est caché au fond d'un couloir et derrière une porte avec  comme seule indication le caractère japonais sur la porte pour être mis dans l'ambiance immédiatement ! Un des meilleurs endroit de Montréal"}
{"text":"I've heard about this bar a million times and finally jumped the gun to come! Super cozy and quaint. Very romantic atmosphere and the decor and music is on point. On the pricier side but the drinks are well done and service is great. Great for a chill tête à tête !"}
{"text":"It's nice to go there with your friend to grab a drink or with a date.. But it's not the kind of place you will go with 4 o more people.."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for drinks on a Thursday night. The place was full but not packed making it comfortable and having enough room for a larger group (8) to sit. The ambiance is great. The candle lit atmosphere would also be great for a date. Age wise the crowd is anywhere from 20-40 so it really seems to suit everyone. Drinks were good, a little pricey but worth the whole vibe. A real \"hidden gem\" considering its entrance is a creepy black door with graffiti on it and you REALLY need to know where it is or you would walk right past it without the slightest clue of what you missed. definitely going back. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"The ambiance of Big in Japan is undeniably unmatched. It was a surprise when I found out the fashion the manager treats clients is also unmatched. Andre left us wishing we were the clients beside us,  as it was clear that our business did not require the same courtesy or kindness as the table beside us.  There is no fun to be had here. At all. Rules rules rules. Follow them or leave."}
{"text":"Bon, je suis allé au Big in Japan un lundi midi... même late lunch... j'avoue que je ne m'attendais pas à la \"top ambiance\" mais c'était relax et sympathique. J'ai pris la salade au poulet citronnée qui était vraiment très bonne et mes amies ont pris le poulet frit avec riz... assez bon ! Le menu midi est toutefois plutôt petit. Bref, c'est un petit spot sympa où je ne crois pas que tu peux être déçu mais tu ne tomberas pas de ta chaise de délire gustatif non plus... Je vais sans doute réessayer pour le souper."}
{"text":"Classic \"hidden door with no name\" that brings in a very hipster type of crowd. Be ready to wait for a while on busy nights. In fact, last time I went, we waited for 30 minutes before being sent in, and when we walked in, there was no seats available at all anywhere.   After a narrow corridor with curtains on each side, you get to a candle lit bar that creates an interesting atmosphere. The place isn't really designed for crowds of more than 3-4 people though, as you have to sit one beside the other in most cases.   They have a good selection of alcohol, you can buy a bottle and it'll hang on the ceiling until your next visit, which is nice. However, it's all overpriced, and in both times I went, the service was mostly absent."}
{"text":"I love big in Japan my husband on the other hand didn't get it (haha) the entrance is rugged, you walk down a long dark path and then u arrive into this amazing zen of candles everywhere. Unfortunately all the other couples were occupying the good seats and we ended up siting in a back area which were also good, as we got to see the mixologists work their magic in bow ties (Fun). Make no mistake this bar is very romantic I would recommend brining that special someone here to turn up the romance."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by one of my good friends. While hunting for food and drink that was open on a Sunday night, I checked to see if this place was open for a super long Sunday hike.   It did not disappoint. If it wasn't for the picture that showed which door this place was, I probably would have wandered in the dark for a bit.  Inside was a cozy speakeasy-style bar with minimal apron-dawned staff and a very intimate crowd. I so impressed my friend and was internally stoked.   Cocktails were solid, price was per usual in Boston, and I enjoyed the quiet ambience oh so much.  Want to seem in the Montreal know? Scope this place out."}
{"text":"Really nice bar, wonderful interior set up. Good for dates, not really a group place as the ambiance is pretty quiet. Ask the bartender any question and he'll be able to help you find the perfect drink depending on your taste, even if its off the menu."}
{"text":"Make sure not to mix this place up with the Big in Japan bar, because they're two completely different places.  We had the tuna tataki which good, and the fried chicken piece appetizer which was basically an escalope cut up into strips, not worth it. We also took a beef and tofu ramen to share, and it just wasn't a good mix at all. The portion was great, but dish tasted like someone had a recipe for a pasta sauce and instead mixed it with ramen. It just didn't go well together.  The vibe was alright though, really diner-y. I just didn't get the Japanese vibe at all."}
{"text":"Cool interior, drinks are perfect! Food is also of good portion size and delicious ;)"}
{"text":"5 Stars for design and ambiance.  The cocktails were great, the bartenders were pretty helpful, even though they were busy.  The prices are fairly reasonable for the quality. I really liked that they have a program you can buy a bottle of whiskey and they hold that bottle for you for every time you come in, badass.  Liked it alot here."}
{"text":"I love a good cocktail bar and am glad I found this gem -- it'll be my new go-to place for drinks in Montreal. It's a perfect place for a date or catching up with friends. Intimate and cozy -- not the best for a large group, mind you. I was a bit put off by having to line up, but it was ~10pm on a Saturday night. My party of 3 ended up waiting for 15-20 minutes in the little hallway behind the velvet curtain. We didn't mind too much. It did seem a bit odd that there was a dude in a tuxedo manning the entrance. He was very strict about letting people poke their heads in to see what the bar looked like (since there are no windows and it's just a tiny unassuming red door). He would let people in based on his own discretion -- it didn't make a whole lot of sense because he would sometimes let a bunch of people in, yet no one had exited in a while.   Whatever. Once you're in, it's a beautiful, elegant place. You feel worlds away from the busy Rue St. Laurent... It's got that speakeasy vibe. The hanging bottles of Japanese whisky, candlelit tables, soft jazz, and bow-tie-wearing servers create a cool atmosphere. The crowd is eclectic -- everything from university students to hipsters to middle aged couples. The drinks are good and reasonably priced. I really enjoyed my champagne cocktail (made with cava, $10). I also had a negroni, which was good but super-strong so I had to sip that one very slowly. The servers are very knowledgeable about booze. My DC had a manhattan and the server went into great detail about the different whisky options and what would work best for the cocktail. Saw some people order the bourbon lemonade ($25). It comes in a little glass bowl and you can serve yourself with a ladel. Cute. They also have some snack items like edamame, veggies and dip, etc. We didn't try those though.   Okay, Big in Japan is a little bit scene-y, but it offers a cool experience, great service and very few tourists. I will be back."}
{"text":"As other reviewers said, ambiance is key and the staff is superb. it's a bit difficult to find but that's part of the appeal.. the interior is cozy and uniquely designed and inspired by bars in Japan. The owner came to speak with my friends and I personally, who were visiting from Europe and bought us a round of shots on the house!! Very sweet. Will def visit when in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Rude, unprofessional and not accommodating. They made us wait in the cold when the place had a lot of vacant seats. Instead we were put in the back. We are a young group of mixed ethnicities and a lot of judgement was passed. We were spoken to rudely by one of the servers. Easily could have been a good payday for them. Will not return   As another reviewer Faiza noted, we had the same experience with being singled out"}
{"text":"My visit on a Wednesday at 6PM was the perfect experience. I found the gray door and walked right in not knowing what to expect.  The strange bar top setup with a bajillion of candles lit up and down the tables was the coolest experience, especially when no one was in. I ordered Between the Sheets and a Grapefruit Sour and they were both amazing drinks. Between the Sheets wasn't a sweet drink itself but the orange sugar rim was the perfect complementing factor. The Grapefruit Sour? Don't get me started! The perfect mousse on top to the light flavors in the drink itself were subtle and invigorating.   If you start a tab they give you a plastic card to remind you to get your card back. If you start a bottle of whisky they write your name and hang it up on the ceiling, giving you a year to visit and finish it. If you go on a Thursday night at 10PM you have to deal with the bouncer who doesn't give a flying monkey you exist. Don't go on a busy night. Second place where I realized Montrealers don't know how to line up.  There are hooks on each pole under the bar-top to hang your bag and also hooks on the walls to hang your jacket. Music was interesting. It was a mix between jazz and modern, at one point the song \"Big in Japan\" was playing while later on \"Sweet Caroline\" was playing... Service was stellar."}
{"text":"This place is popular! At 10:30 on a Saturday we waited 20 min to get it. However we luckily scored the best seats in the pace and really enjoyed out drinks, gin & ginger, something gin and minty, the house malt whiskey you see hanging from the ceiling (regulars buy a bottle and they write your name on it and keep there for you) and a shocu, which was a very small portion but service was great, ambiance is fantastic for a date or intimate night with the smaller the group the better. Hang your coat on the wall, find a seat, start a tab, and for god sakes don't be too loud."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere are OK but food taste really bad! Avoid this place...  We ordered the buns and bread was fine but the pork was hard and really not tender. The ramen was actually the worst ramen I ever had. Actually I'm pretty sure the pork was the same cut as the buns. It look like it was pre-cooked frozen pork.   The bar is cool, but don't go to the restaurant."}
{"text":"So I don't really know that any of what we ordered would be big in Japan but it was a big hit with us!. Between four people we had 2 ramens, 1 rice bowl and 1 appetizer.  Serving sizes were huge and we almost couldn't finish everything but with top buttons undone we managed to.  For the appi we had an agedashi tofu which was fantastic. It was a great balance of fried tofu, sauce and seasoning. Plus, I really enjoyed the thin as air batter which. The ramens and rice bowls were all equally as good with the creamy one being standout. I can't remember the name of it but I remember it was creamy and had eggplant and was unlike any ramen I've tasted before.  It was bursting with flavor, little sides of mushroom and veggies and was SO good. I would go back just for this ramen alone. The other dishes were good, but compared against the above ramen, it just wasn't as delicious.   Overall, Big in Japan is a bit hit in my belly and I can't wait to go back and indulge.  Five stars for creativity, service and unique items."}
{"text":"TLDR: Beautifully sophisticated speakeasy, with a great selection of whiskies and cocktails.  Simply put, I love this speakeasy so much. The decoration is refined and mature which allows for a wonderful sense of intimacy. I would recommend this bar for small groups 2-4 people or dates. Anything larger and you detract from the intimacy of the place.  My date ordered a Manhattan and the bartender kindly explained the different types (dry, sweet) and recommended which whisky best suited his choice of sweet. I ordered a Royal Kir. The Manhattan was extremely smooth, and the Royal Kir was deceptively simple and perfectly executed.  I've enjoyed their punch bowl in the past, and it was wonderful. Unfortunately, I was driving that evening, so I was limited in my drink volume. At the end of the menu, they also provide mocktails for those who do not drink.  I will only come on a weekday now so I can avoid the lines that build outside on the weekends. The fewer people there are the more you can enjoy the ambience of the place properly. It was a joy talking to the bartender, and I look forward to my next visit. Definitely, a place to take someone you are trying to impress."}
{"text":"We were looking for comfort food while on our trip to Montreal and somebody suggested we check this place out. The food was tasty. I was immediately super impressed with my meal but after a few bites realized it wasn't quite what I was hoping for. It was delicious none-the-less.   We ordered a few beers that we did not enjoy. The service was fine and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Absolutely breathtaking. I love this spot. The only thing I don't love is the service. Don't get me wrong, the bartenders are very nice, but they always rush me to pay. It's very obnoxious. If I'm spending $16 on a cocktail, I'd like to enjoy it and not have someone coming around every 2 seconds to see if I'm ready to pay. Maybe that's just me... anyway, that's my one and only complaint. Everything else is sublime."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! One of the nicest, well-hidden jewels of Montreal. The ambience and music are unparalleled. The drinks are creative too. I highly recommend the sour whiskey."}
{"text":"Big in Japan is quite unique bar. Multiple candle lights, great seating set up and the time will fly smoothly wether you are with a big crowd of friends or just with your date. The music is enchanting, I loved listening to French chansons and classics from the 50's, and 60's, it is rare even in francophone QC to hear Edith Piaf in a bar.    The personnel is knowledgeable and if the first drink was not exactly what you wanted they will make it up to your taste on the second round. The cocktails are nice, but I'm much more impressed with the sakes and the Japanese whiskeys in the drinks list. I actually secretly wish there was a wider sake selection and tasting flights, but what Big in Japan offers is pretty good already. The tuna tataki is great snack and the kimchi dip for the chips is delicious, and original.   Note some customers are writing reviews about the restaurant with the same name on the bar page. Ignore them!   As Mme Piaf sings \"no, Je ne regrette rien\" about the time spend in Big in Japan. Santé!"}
{"text":"These three stars are purely for the excitement of finding a secret/speakeasy-type bar and the decor. When it comes down to it though, the drinks were subpar for the price, the service bland, and we left feeling a little disappointed.   They seemed to skimp on the alcohol in my opinion. My husband ordered a $13 glass of whiskey, and was given significantly less than the standard 2 fingers. My gin cocktail tasted like straight up lemonade (and not in a good way).   Service was pretty minimal. I felt like they were waiting for us to order multiple drinks but there was no welcoming sense from the bartender or any conversation whatsoever besides the bare minimum of taking our order and silently running our card through the machine. Maybe it was just a bad night?"}
{"text":"Big in Japan was one of the first Japanese restaurants I tried when I first came to Montreal, and remains one of my favourite ramen joints until today. Their signature eggplant-minced pork ramen is the bomb and is always my top choice every time I come here. The portions are big and very flavourful, not like the average miso broth in mediocre ramen bars. The dessert and creative dinner options are always fun to try out and I always recommend this place to friends from out of town. A bonus on the side is its convenient location on St.Laurent -- within walking distance to many great speakeasies, jazz bars and clubs. Definitely recommend the Big in Japan bar down the street. There's no sign though, so you will have to look very carefully for the hidden door!"}
{"text":"Tried to come here 4 times. On the 4th time (Sunday evening), we snagged a seat at the labyrinth style bar. They don't have many cocktail options and for a place that has whisky bottles hanging from the ceiling, you'd think they would have more than 2 whiskeys (Yamazaki & Nikka). Also, for a half jigger of whiskey (\"glass\") will run you 11 or 13 dollars depending on which kind you choose. We just headed down to Else's and got much better whiskeys for much cheaper. The waitress was also a bit pretentious and couldn't really speak English *and* asked me to take my purse off the table even though the bar was nearly empty (~6 other people inside)"}
{"text":"I feel guilty using their wi-fi.  Good news is the draft beer (12oz) is $4.  Bad news: the miso ramen is to miso ramen what chop suey is to Hong Kong style noodles.  Also the all Canadian staff was very friendly. Enuf said."}
{"text":"Cute space but the cocktails are mediocre and the manager is a fucking prick. Do not patronize this establishment."}
{"text":"My favourite bar in Montreal! Classy and simple, and I love Japanese whiskey. Cooler yet, it's kind of hidden away. The door doesn't look like the door of a business and that sets you up for a wonderful surprise. I've seen it a few tunes on dates or meetings where people have that \"where are we going\" look, followed by the \"wow.\"   The good news is that it just gets better from there. The ambience is really chill with a great music selection, bottles of whiskey hanging from the ceiling, and a good amount of pda.   You kind of feel cooler just cause you're in the spot.   I am also told it also has the feel of a great post break up bar. Ha!"}
{"text":"Sexy - initimate - almost hidden. I love this place. It's my new favourite bar in MTL.  Right at the corner of St.Laurent and Rachel in the plateau, you wouldn't know it was there unless you really were looking for it. As soon as you enter the long corridor entrance and get a glimpse of the candlelit interior peaking through curtains, you know it's a magical place. It's romantic - it's jazzy - it's everything you want on a first date.  In terms of the menu, you're looking at some great options - a page with drinks dedicated to Japan, including 12 and 15 year old scotch, along with a great pan global selection including some great Amaro's.  You can even buy a bottle of Scotch for $250 and finish it at a later date. when you purchase a bottle, it gets added to the individual suspensions along the centre of the bar, almost making it part of the decor. From then on you have roughly a year to come back on multiple occasions and finish it, or you can have your friends come by and do it for you. Your name and ID number is jotted down for later use. Great concept.   Service is excellent and informed."}
{"text":"I love this place. Service has always been good.  It's hard to find, and doesn't look like much from the street, but that's part of the charm.  The food I've seen my friends order here (and have tried via them) as been good - the tuna tataki keeps showing up, and is really good.  The décor is great - what's not to like about whiskey hanging from the ceiling!?  If you want to try something different and very Japanese, go for the umeshu. It's plum whiskey, and is sweet without being too sweet, and still has a whiskey kick to it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately a nice night out turned sour because of one person - the manager/owner, Andre - who was rude from the very beginning. There were ten of us willing and ready to celebrate our dear friend's bachelorette party. We asked about the pitcher of punch: how many glasses can it serve? And Andre responds \"it's a pitcher.,\" without further clarifying and giving us a look as if we were stupid. We asked him to be specific and hesitantly he told us. My friend also asked about a specific drink: \"what is in it?\" And he told her to read the menu... well Andre, if we read French we wouldn't have asked you. Throughout the entire time we were there (a solid two hours) we didn't hesitate to order drinks, but did he come over to speak to us (like he did with other customers?) no! Did we care? No! However, when he did come to us he would have something negative and condescending to say. The waiter was sweet and was petrified when we asked to use our flashlight to double check the bill. We didn't want to get him in trouble so we didn't. Drinks were only OK. Liked the ambiance. Experience is a no go and wouldn't recommend simply because of rude Andre."}
{"text":"VIBE  Nice speakeasy. EVERYONE was here on a date. It's a sexy place. There really is no other bar like it. It's fun trying to find your seat and feeling like you're in that game mousetrap in its maze-like setting. The server tuxedo uniforms are a bit too formal but it adds to the whole ambiance. The staff was okay but we did find it took a long time at the end of the night to get our bill and it wasn't busy.   WE DRANK/ATE  Damn it, I can't think of the drink I had. So that must be a good thing because it's boozy.  What I do love about this place is the korean take on bar snacks like chips and salsa. The salsa has kimchi in it; and the chips are house-made. Very spicy but different!  OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I love it here. Fun spot but I guess I should bring a date instead of a girlfriend. I also don't think I'd want to come here on a Saturday. Seems too crowded and too \"datey.\""}
{"text":"The drinks are pretty good but I go there for the atmosphere and the classy vibe. The candle lights and the soft music make for a very romantic setting."}
{"text":"Bar intéressant situé dans le Plateau. On se retrouve face à une porte rouge avec un symbole chinois, on franchie la porte et un petit corridor sombre s'offre à nous avec des rideaux qui cachent l'entrée du bar. Puis, on arrive dans un endroit aux lumières tamisées, des tables longues en bois, des tables individuelles pour plus d'intimité. C'est en endroit très fancy, on y va pour impressionner. Les drinks ne sont pas impressionnants, on répète les mêmes classiques. Les prix sont quant à eux pas mal élevés. Donc on se gâte, on amène une date mais je ne serais pas une clientèle régulière de l'endroit. Service correcte mais sans plus, pas du tout personnalisé comme certains speakeasy ou je suis allée sur St-Denis."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my worst experiences. Decided to stop for a quick bite before meeting a friend and since the place was empty, I expected fast service. Boy was I wrong. It took ages for the tuna tataki and buns to come out. Texture of the tuna was very dodgy and the taste was more than lifeless. The buns were far from light and fluffy as they should be and the vegetables on them were seriously dehydrated. Total embarrassment to Asian food."}
{"text":"Japanese Isakayas seem to be in style these days. We thought we had discovered a gem on a busy saturday night, and they even had room! Turns out, there was a reason for it.  The concept is japanese tapas, and seems neat at first. The menu seems original \"fried garlic\", \"green tea short ribs\".   Crime  #1: \"The Fried Garlic\". 4.50$. It comes as two heads of garlic, with a toothpick, fried and a spoonful of a nondescript red paste.  #2: The steamed buns. It's nice to know that David Chang and Momofuku's influence has made it up the I87 to Montreal, but this is just a travesty. These look like the same momofuku-style buns, for the same price, but with rubbery, pasty buns,  leaking odd-colored liquids into a pool on the plate, and filled with what looked like meat from the taco place down the road. For sure, David chang's buns are over hyper and overpriced, but they are perfectly put together and offer a perfect bite. These are truly a shame.  #3: Sake Mussels: 12$. A nice sized bowl of mussels that smelled like the fish section of Provigo on a sunday night. Half of them were closed. We ate 3 mussels and decided, for own health to stop. When we asked for the bill with a full plate of mussels on the table, the waiter didnt even act surprised.  Clearly, the folks at Big in Japan took this concept of an Isakaya,  charging New York prices, and cut corners at every single level. What a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Super resto. Copieuses portions et surprise agréable dans l'assiette."}
{"text":"What to say about big in japan, in one word : BAAAD!!  In a few more words:  The food is not authentic Japanese, light years away from perfection usually found in real Japanese restaurants.   Ramen soup was too salty and greasy, it really tasted bad.   Really a disappointment, go to Ramenya or Kazu, much better culinary experiences than this cafeteria."}
{"text":"Overall, LOVED this bar. The concept was great always love a good speak-easy type of place, if you're not paying attention you'll walk past and not even know you missed it.   BUT ...the manager needs to relax a bit. Instead of enjoying our time there my friend and I were only able to notice him walking back and forth hovering over/micromanaging his staff & being rude to them. In a span of 5 min he probably walked to the front of the bar about 8-9 times. My friend and I tried to ask him where the bathroom was and he gave us the hold on finger and never came back. Although very pleasant while serving, the staff did not look happy to be there, which is upsetting.   Excellent drinks- loved the one large ice cube in my drink, small menu but great food - the seared tuna plate was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Liquor hangs from the ceiling.  Negronis are INSANE. Grey textiles cover the walls.  Oil lamps light the joint.  The staff is classic. Like crisp white shirt and bowtie classic.  There is absolutely no reason to not adore this place, except for the fact that I live in Wisconsin and its in Montreal."}
{"text":"Endroit très chaleureux et particulièrement different ! J'ai été agréablement surprise! Bouffe differente et abordable , service rapide et déco funky ! J'ai bien aimé!"}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, incredible service and drinks worth spending the last few pennies in your bank account on.   My partner and I came here for our friends wedding reception ( it was a very small wedding) and got the $65 punch bowl. It sounds expensive, but if you think about how much a bill could be for sub-par drinks for 4 people at another bar, you can see how it's a steal. And oh so yummy! Rock on Big In Japan Bar, you're definitely one of my Montreal favorites."}
{"text":"Very cool little bar, it has that old feel to it, like an old school speak easy.  The entrance is just a red door, so you have to know where your going and the interior is a mix or run down cement wall with cement re-bar sticking out of the wall as a coat rack mixed with elegant decor, lighting and a very interesting seating arrangement.  You want to come here for the atmosphere and the experience, I had a few Sake's to tie in the whole experience, and will definitely make this a stop in future outings.  PS don't confuse this place with \"Big in Japan\" which is a restaurant.. totally different place, but same owner from what I understand."}
{"text":"It is very easy to walk by this bar and miss it.  There is nothing but a door with \"Bar\" written on it and some Japanese words.  The secretive vibe makes it all much more cooler.  Inside it has an intimate, upscale ambiance going on.    The drinks are more expensive here but they are strong.  If cocktails are your thing then you will enjoy Big in Japan.  There is a small selection of snacks if you're hungry but if you want a full meal you have to go elsewhere.  The pecans are the best option and so addictive!"}
{"text":"One of the nicest bars in Montreal! Someone recommended it to me. It was hard to find at first because there are no visible address. I wasn't expecting to see such a nice bar looking at the front door. I think the owners did that on purpose. Once you enter the door the bar is one of the most sophisticated ones I've ever seen. I loved the way it was shaped. I enjoyed the dim lighting and the rows of candles throughout the whole bar. The Japanese whiskey bottles hanging from the ceiling was such a brilliant idea. Unfortunately, I don't remember the cocktails I had but they were really good! The bartenders were dressed so elegantly and they were really nice. I highly recommend it and if I go back to Montreal to visit, I'll definitely make sure to stop by because I loved it!"}
{"text":"Lovely lighting, great drinks. A little pricey, but had a great time!  It was, indeed, slightly tricky to find (which just made it more fun), but we went pretty early on a friday evening so there was no line.  Beautiful!"}
{"text":"Si vous êtes à la recherche d'un bar fancy pour un rendez-vous romantique, le Big in Japan est l'endroit idéal. Ne vous laissez pas décourager par l'entrée (la porte sur Saint-Laurent fait presque peur!). L'ambiance change du tout au tout quand vous êtes à l'intérieur. Service impeccable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Bar chic et caché à Montréal, il faut en effet, savoir qu'il est là parce qu'ici pas de grande enseigne à l'avant. La porte est sobre et rien n'indique qu'il se cache un bar derrière. Après être entré, un couloir et enfin le bar éclairé à la lueurs de bougies. Les serveurs et serveuses sont en smoking, l'ambiance est tamisée, on se croirait dans un film.  Réputé pour ses whisky (parfois or de prix), j'ai toutefois préféré un cocktail qui etait très bien préparé. Parfait pour un rendez vous galant (ou pour sortir ses habits de soirées tout simplement)."}
{"text":"Classy and beautiful. Had a fantastic experience the first 2 times, the third wasn't great because they sat us in the crappier portion in the back, which lacks the amazing speakeasy atmosphere. Eventually we were moved to better seats and had a great night."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a handful of blogs/people so I had to check it out during my brief stay in Montreal.   I came in fairly late for dinner (9:45ish) and my waitress was super friendly and attentive and my food came out really quickly which is important because I am both impatient and hungry, pretty much all the time.   I had the agadashi tofu which was great and as I was eating it I was thinking about the time I didn't like (or understand) tofu as a child and shook my head in disgust because tofu is dope as hell. How naive of me.   I had the spicy kimchi udon soup as my entree. Holy hell it's a huge portion, so I struggled to finish it (I almost did! Probably because I had the experience- one time in Sydney I entered a ramen eating contest and ate like 5 bowls of ramen in one sitting. Do Not Recommend.) But alas, it was delicious and full of fun surprises like lil mushrooms.   They play retro music from the 50s/60s which was a nice alternative.   Cool spot. Would definitely come back- but with a friend next time to help me eat everything."}
{"text":"Beau p'tit bar ! Belle ambiance intime ! N'oubliez pas l'entrée est par la porte rouge sur St-Laurent !"}
{"text":"This is a really cool place. The set up of the tables and chairs are awesome. It's like a maze or loop. The atmosphere is nice. It's a cool, hipster hang out spot for drinks with friends. They're really on top of their service."}
{"text":"Came here last week with an old high school buddy since we decided to try out a place from the Montreal episode of Anthony Bourdain's series, The Layover. so we settled on trying this place since neither of us had gone.  First up, we decided to order 2 appetizers and share, what came was a very tasty dish of fried chicken and a second dish of fried pork under a mound of fresh watercress and sliced radishes and onions. Both were very tasty and by appetizer-standards quite large dishes and very filling. We began to wonder if ordering mains  may have been a bad idea and overkill.  I ordered the Green Tea spare ribs and my friend ordered a Ramen noodle dish with beef and eggplant. My ribs, if a bit dry, were OK, (FAR better than Bar B Barn, which I can't stand), and the green tea sauce at the bottom of the dish was very lightly flavoured with matcha. It's not the best ribs I've ever had but I'll give them points for originality. My friend however was very disappointed with his dish, he described it almost as if it was a Taco which they just threw into a soup with Ramen noodles and vowed never to order this again.  The décor is very funky and clever and yes, it does almost have a cafeteria-style and vibe to it. The service we received was friendly and casual. I'd come back here if for anything else to try out more of these appetizers!"}
{"text":"What a fun night we had at this place! No wait for a table, though the seats were horribly uncomfortable (I get that they're retro -- but there's a reason most places have upgraded from molded plastic.) We ordered the green tea-ginger punch right away. It was fabulous, light and fruity and not quite boozy enough for experienced drinkers like us. :)  All three of us ordered very different dishes, but they were equally excellent. My husband had a spicy beef ramen with eggplant, about which he is still raving four months later: it had a lovely depth of flavor and was just the right combination of hot, salty and piquant. Our friend ordered a ramen salad that was cooler and lighter: crispy pork, vegetables, and curly noodles. I ordered the tuna tataki, seared and served with lightly-dressed greens -- and I also got some of each of their meals, because they were so huge! Seriously, they don't call it Big in Japan for nothing.  Our server was incredibly nice even though she had some difficulty understanding us (we were speaking English in deference to my husband, who doesn't speak French, and the music in there was also really loud.) Next time we visit Montreal, I will make it a priority to return here!"}
{"text":"Big in Japan is another Speakeasy bar we visited during my Weekend in Montreal.  Coming on a weekday evening, there was no wait at all. But since it was not busy, one might argued it lack that hopping vibe for a night joint.  Cocktails that offers here is more classical with simpler elements. I was hoping for more \"Japanese\" fusion twist. Their Japanese whisky selection though is excellent if you want to try out a few.  We ordered a few drinks which were well crafted.   Here the star is definitely that bar area which has this unconventional set up of a curving bar."}
{"text":"As far as bars go, I think this is my favourite one yet. A friend was showing us around Montreal and had this bad boy up his sleeve as a 'surprise'. When we got to the black door with graffiti (may have been formerly red), I thought he was pulling my leg. I had ants in my pants walking down the short hallway and was amazed when he pulled back the curtain!  This is the most chic bar I've ever been to. Use it to impress the girl you like... or even her mother! This place isn't what it seems and stuns the eye when you enter. I love the candles lining the table tops. The whiskey hanging from the ceiling is a nice touch. Also, take a peak at the back if you can cause you might be able to see the server shaking up your drinks - it's quite cool. Their drink menu is good. As a person who doesn't drink I appreciated the non-alcohol menu. The pricing was apt because you're mostly paying for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yummm love this little discovery! Everything tastes so good. We shared the gyoza, tuna, chicken wings (a must) and crispy pork as appetizers. All equally awesome. Then I don't know i continue eating but we shared the steak. It's huge! It comes with rice and veggies. Really good!! I really recommend this place. Oh yeah and don't forget to get a pitcher of there awesome punch!"}
{"text":"My friends and I mistakenly walked into Big In Japan [restaurant] before being correctly directed down the street to an unmarked \"big black door\" (FYI, the door did have Japanese characters on it). From behind this door peeked a doorman, who served as a bouncer for this speakeasy-esque establishment. The lighting inside was dim, and the seating was sparse when we arrived. The four of us managed to snag some space in the back corner, where we settled in to sip on some whiskey and chat. The bar has a variety of whiskey and cocktails on the menu, and knowing nothing about whiskey, I just randomly chose one from the menu. As luck would have it they were out of the one I chose, but our server was very knowledgeable and was able to suggest a similar (yummy) smoky scotch. Overall, this bar is a great place for some post-dinner drinks with friends or with a date, or simply for a nightcap."}
{"text":"Great little bar in Montreal. The bartenders were very friendly and the service was great. Its small and cozy. I loved all the little candles and they have a wide variety of drinks. I don't remember what drinks we had but they were all different and delicious. I'll be back if I'm ever in Montreal."}
{"text":"Ordered a buta don and a miso ramen. Taste like something diy. Definitely won't return there."}
{"text":"Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu. Unique and fun to bring OOT friends to."}
{"text":"Big in Japan Bar is an excellent cocktail spot. It's not exactly a speakeasy, but it's easy to miss the nondescript Japanese lettering on the door.  Once you get inside, there are these plexiglass dividers all along the bar, to help you wayfind to a table. We were a large group so we actually sat at the back bar, where we had the bartender's semi-undivided attention. He was a super cool guy and gave us good drink recommendations.  I was a big fan of the Gold Rush, which had bourbon and honey. Great combo. Didn't try any of the food as this was just our precursor to dinner. But note that this is NOT Big in Japan Restaurant (which has dismal health ratings).  Would definitely recommend Big in Japan Bar for a nice lowkey semi-fancy cocktail. Seems like a great date spot as well."}
{"text":"Miso Ramen was way too salty and the pork was tough. Doesn't taste very authentic, just very very salty and meh."}
{"text":"Le big in japan vous renvoie dans les années 20 au temps de la prohibition, lumière tamisé, éclairage à la bougie, musique rétro et ces fameuses bouteille de whisky suspendu qui vous font de l'il toute la soirée. Un jeudi soir le bar affiche complet, le service est agréable et les cocktails très bon, l'ambiance est détendu et calme enfin un bar ou on s'entend parlé. Nous reviendrons :)"}
{"text":"Love the big red door, the walk in and all of the glass and cool seating. My Pimm's cocktail was most fab and our waitress was very sweet. I love how my out of town people couldn't believe that there was a bar behind that door. Once you walk in through the narrow hallway, the bar opens into a fabulous, intimate spot that is both posh yet inviting. I love this place."}
{"text":"I love this bar! I love how classy it is, the comfortable seats, the dim romantic lighting and how exclusive you feel walking in there. The drinks were perfect! Best pim's cup I've ordered in Montreal and I also tried the gin buck cocktail which was excellent."}
{"text":"What I love about this joint is that it feels luxe. There's no big sign outside. There's nothing. You enter an odd looking door, walk down a short, dark corridor, and you enter an impressively classy spot. Very good music, friendly staff, good drinks and food... it's one of my favourite places and I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. I love the speakeasy style with the door simply marked \"bar\". As I went in I was very formally welcomed by the bartender who made me one of the best martinis I have ever had. Will definitely return. I am very happy that I was able to find a great place for martinis. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great high end cocktails. The maze setup of the tables is very cool. PLUS: you can order a bottle and leave it at the bar for a year. With your signature and everything! I haven't seen that since my last trip to Qatar!(about 14 years). Whenever you want to stow your bottle, they hang it on the wall! Hahaha so awesome. Next time I will buy a bottle and leave it there for special occasions or whenever I feel like hiding out from the world. :p"}
{"text":"At first I was, like, \"Whaa???\" But the tips are helpful: there are two listings and two similar businesses: one is for the restaurant and one is for the bar. If you know me by now, know that I'm reviewing the bar.  One step through the red door & curtains (look for the white rabbit; really, not really) and you're bound on an adventure. If there's such a thing as  Japanese speakeasy, this is it. I hadn't ever been to a place quite like Big In Japan and its history as a famous (right word?) drug dealer bar added to the allure (again... right word?). Its past firmly behind it, this bar is all about interesting cocktails either created from the menu or the whim of the bartender. Since I think it's important for mixologists to be able to let their freak flag fly, I  was all about trying whatever concoction sprang from the imagination banks our of very funny and personable bartender.   For my first drink, I tried a Gin Buck. This drink was a surprise for me because I'm not much of a gun fan. But the bartender's offer to make me something else if I didn't like it was guarantee enough for me to try it. It's a simple, classic cocktail and it's stood the ages for a reason. Refreshing (gin, lemon & ginger ale), tasty and uncomplicated, I've come to understand that cocktails like these are about precision. The measurements have to be correct and the ingredients must be better than what the average joe picks out of the supermarket. The drink skews sweet but not overly so. The next drink was a special creation. Staying with gin (what? I know!), I told the bartender what my flavor profile leans toward. I have no idea what I drank but a.) I'm here to tell the tale b.) it was delicious and c.) it fit my drink profile to a tee. If I knew what the heck I imbibed, I might have a new, signature cocktail that was individualized to me. You don't get that everyday.  I love Montreal."}
{"text":"I like the ramen and this was a really huge portion. And I tried the sesame milkshake, I like too. For my opinion, the price is a little too expensive. But I think, I will go back and have ramen again."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this establishment is popular. We ordered two dishes: Buta don (rice bowl of rice with pork where the best part was...the bland ice) and a very soggy okonomiyaki covered in salad and shrimps. Awful. Does the chef know what an okonomiyaki is supposed to look and taste like? Does the waitress have any clue?  Maybe it's because everything is so overly salted that people need to buy a lot of alcohol to quench their thirst, so much that they end up having a good time in the end... it's genius! It's the only possible explanation that I can find.   Avoid Big in Japan the Restaurant. I do hear that Big in Japan the Bar is quite good tho."}
{"text":"The miso soup and braised pork are very salty. And the menu doesn't say the tataki de thon and the pork are spicy."}
{"text":"J'étais tellement excitée d'essayer ce resto! J'y passais toujours à côté et j'en ai entendu parler à travers le vidéo de layover à Montréal d'Anthony Bourdain.  Cette adresse est une destination de choix pour les chefs puisque ce restaurant est ouvert jusqu'aux petites heures du matin!  Par contre, le menu de nuit est différent que le menu de jour.  Il change à partir de minuit plus précisément.  Beaucoup plus court et servant davantage des snacks.  Nous avons commandé le bol de ramen et le porc croustillant.  Le ramen était servi dans de la soupe miso avec des morceaux de porc bbq.  Les nouilles étaient résistante sous la dent à souhait, mais je n'ai pas adoré le bouillon étant beaucoup trop salé.  Le porc était pané et frit à la perfection.  Servi avec une touche d'algues séchés, des graines de sésame et le tout sur un lit de riz, le plat aurait été parfait s'ils n'auraient ne l'auraient pas aspergé d'autant de sauce soya.  Je serais définitivement prête à y retourner pour le menu régulier!"}
{"text":"C'est mon genre de bar , speakeasy , lumieres tamisés et musique jazzy, love it ! Service gentil, ambiance romantique et choix limités mais delicieux mmm petits plats gouteux si vous avez un creux."}
{"text":"do not come here i love it and dont want to share  the above is all i wanted to write but yelp does not approve of my reviews witty brevity"}
{"text":"After seeing this on Anthony Bourdain, we had high hopes. Boy, were we disappointed. I don't care that the food wasn't authentic. But the awkward combination of flavors in our mushy, poorly prepared dishes betrayed a complete lack of mastery that made us rethink our planned restaurant itinerary.   I was sorry to waste a meal in this wonderful city at this establishment. With so many great restaurants in Montreal, don't waste your time at a place so mediocre."}

{"text":"This bar has always been so special to me. Maintaining the old bones of a hidden punk bar from decades past, Big in Japan offers a magical seamless glass bar that snakes around the space with lighted and signed japanese whiskey bottles hanging from the ceiling, dividing the space. The drinks and the service have always followed the classy vibe; so much so that I took friends here years ago to finish off their elopement. I literally brought a (tiny) wedding here.  Where I get uncomfortable about Big in Japan is that I've heard, several times through the restaurant grapevine, that the workers are treated poorly here. I can't comment too firmly on this (and generally I never review restaurants my friends or me have worked at), but it adds up when I realize I've been going here for years and I don't think I've ever seen the same bartender twice. Food for thought to take with a grain of salt and a fantastic drink."}
{"text":"First off, I want to say, I loved the concept. The detailing in our experience was really something else.  That being said, the food itself was just OK, considering it was a bowl of ramen for fifteen bucks. Seriously. I could have gotten the same thing at GaNaDaRa in the West End for a fraction of the price.  As for the service, while I agree that they do try their best, I'm pretty sure they switched our waitress halfway through because the first one we had didn't speak English.  This was a bit strange, since as a result we waited around to order for some time. They also placed us (a couple on a date) at the bar, nearly a meter away from each other, which made for holding hands at the table quite awkward.  I'd maybe suggest just going to this place as a late-night joint? As a dinner date venue, it was something of a let-down."}
{"text":"Fancy fancy place. The service is like high-end restaurant or a 5-star hotel hospitality. Polite and extremely courteous! It took a while to find this place but it does get quite busy and noisy towards the night.  They make snack-ish plates like the honey nuts and tuna tataki, which were very very tasty. Cocktails are pretty nice. Overall the drinks and food menu is very short indeed, but the beautiful atmosphere makes up for the price.  It is a maze of candles and tables, it's especially beautiful when full (even with people to stare at right in front of you). It's a great place to spend the late night.  You must see it once!"}
{"text":"I came here based on all of the rave reviews expecting nothing short of a divey speakeasy with classy lighting and strong drinks. It took us a bit to find this place as it's unassuming entrance is just that...unassuming. Once inside, you have your choice of sitting at the winding hightop counter, the bar or the elongated table that doesn't get much action.  We were immediately given menus and both choose the Tokyo Mule. A nice spin on the Moscow Mule. It tasted more like a mojito with a hint of ginger. Kind of generic but very tasty. After, our drinks were delivered we were asked if we wanted to open a tab or just pay. We were a little taken aback as we had just received our drinks and were unsure if we would want another. Getting the bill so fast from the \"I don't have time for you\" waitress sealed our fate. She never returned to check in on us or see if we wanted another drink. I had high hopes and I hope this is an anomaly. Save your money and spend it where they take the time to at least talk to you."}
{"text":"Busy atmosphere and can be a bit of a wait. Food is decent enough and the price O.K..  I did find the most memorable thing about Big in Japan, was the service."}
{"text":"Difficult to find, but worth the time.  I went to the bar on a Sunday night--slow at first around 10-ish pm, but it picked up fairly quickly.  I personally had no trouble finding seats with a group of 5 people.  The whiskey selection could have been larger, but was nonetheless great.    The ambiance and atmosphere was especially unique for the Montréal area with candle lighting, an amazing wooden bar, and hanging whiskey rack that acted as the main focus point of the experience.  I would highly recommend \"The Assistant,\" and will definitely be back during my next Montréal visit."}
{"text":"Belle petite place feutrée où l'on s'entend parler. Les cocktails sont bons et les prix sont raisonnable considérant le quartier."}
