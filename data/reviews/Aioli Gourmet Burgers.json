Liked that the screen is easier to read. Nice printed menus too. Purchased a Groupon  (4 burgers 4 sides) gave our orders (one burger and side to go) and was charged $26 and change. I'll take credit for signing and paying albeit confused, my mistake. Apparently lady assumed I only purchased a Groupon for (2 burgers and 2 sides). I pointed that out, she (lady 1) needed help and the lady (lady 2) who helped only asked the cash registrar for an explanation, not me. No sorry no nothing. Immediate refund of $21 no questions asked. I asked why it was only $21 not $26 and change, a brief and now obviously fake glance at the screen and I was told registrar was right not me. Lady 2 walks to the back and cancels 2 burgers and 2 sides. I patiently wait cause I understood the kitchen was busy and there was a line. I explained we needed 4 burgers and 4 fries again, no apologies for their own confusion and mistakes. Lady 2 just says the whole order needs to be cancelled and redone, again no apologies, didn't even offer to help further, just stayed in the kitchen. Lady 1 put in an order for the other 2 burgers and 2 fries (one to go) offered me 2 free drinks which I declined.

Guess what came to our table. Yep, 2 burgers and 2 fries (you know, the one pair that was to go). Explained to the server that we ordered 4, again no apologies, checks with the lady 1 at the register and shortly brings our order to us. Fries tasted like fries anywhere else, crispy, plain. Nothing special like before. Burgers were bland, both my husband and son said burgers were 'ok, not really tasty like last time.'

As we're eating, I notice lady 2 walking and chatting to other patrons. She stop by our table to make amends? Why of course not. She looked at us though, and walked away.

Last week I told my sisters to eat here. Just sent a message on group chat telling them not to waste their time. Few weeks ago told my coworkers to stop by here when they're in the neighborhood, I'll tell them about this visit on Monday.

My advice to management: Tell staff to read, slow down, listen and understand how important customer service is.

Advice to Yelpers: Smash Burger or In N Out. Taste hasn't changed, service much better. If in Vegas, Wahlburgers."}
{"text":"The burgers are terrific and you can't really go wrong on any of them. As an appetizer be sure to order the Mac n Cheese Bites, they are deep fried deliciousness. 

A friendly staff and clean atmosphere make this a must stop while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh wow this place is amazing. The food truck is good but this place is great! The menu is pretty similar but with a few more delicious options and sides. If you are in the area it is definitely worth stopping by for a burger!"}
{"text":"We bought a groupon and thought we would try it and we were pleasantly surprised! Service was nice. I got the California burger and my husband got the italiano. Both were delicious! We got the sweet potato fries and the loaded fries. My husband likes the loaded fries but I thought there was too much cheese (seemed like the fake kind?). And then the sweet potato fries were good but I think I would like to just try the plain next time. I also want to come back to try the dessert!"}
{"text":"We visited Last night wanting to support the new neighborhood spot.  

Four stars based on the service and friendly staff.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt on everything else since it was super busy and clear they have some kinks to work out.

When we arrived, the line to order was back to the door and moving slowly.   It took almost 25 minutes to get our food ordered.  We were fortunate to find a seat while we waited, and waited, and waited.  At that point the seating had become a free for all.  If it's always this busy they'll need a different approach.

When our food arrived, around 35 minutes after we ordered our burgers weren't hot.  They did taste great though... a little on the salty side.  The fries were good too but also not hot.

Definitely some kinks to work out as one would expect in a new restaurant.  We will go back at a less busy time and I'll update this review."}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it. The free Mother's Day burger got us in the door, but the great food and friendly staff will bring us back. So many yummy burgers to try. We had the Black and Blue and The California. Amazing!"}
{"text":"My experience here wasn't horrible, but my gf ordered a Classic with picked onions. They came back with an Aioli Burger, no big deal... We informed our server of this mistake. He came back with the same EXACT BURGER just added pickled onions. Talk about lazy.. 2 stars cause the Lemonade was good. The French fries also were disappointing.. lifeless and sad."}
{"text":"had the Italian burger and it was fantastic. The basil was perfect, not too much not too little. I asked for the meat to be cooked medium...and it was just pink and juicy. Fries were hot and crispy the way they should be. They even offer a gluten-free bun option for their burgers....thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at this restaurant. The hostess who took my order said their beef was fresh Kobi Beef. She raved about the the fact that it was always fresh & juicy. I ordered aged cheddar cheese for the burger and medium rare . She said it wouldn't be more than 10 minutes . I also ordered cooked vegetables as a side. I also ordered sweet potato fries. It was called the Classic burger Combo. When i paid for the burger they charged me a TIP , which confused me to no end. Understand that you have to order at the counter and they bring it to your table. But being a good sport I gave them a 15% tip on top of the original order. they also charged me an up charge for vegetables which I was happy to pay. 
Now when the order was brought to my table 15 minutes later , there were NO Vegetables and my burger. My first bite into the burger was DRY , and TASTELESS. The woman came to my table and inquired How is Your Food ? I told her dry, tasteless and missing my vegetables. She gave me the funniest look , Like was I crazy or what. What she did not ask me was \" would you like something else ? OR what can we do to make you happy. Instead she walked away muttering to herself. I waited at the table for 5 to 6 minutes thinking she was going to bring me my paid for vegetables...NOPE never saw her again , that is until I left. 
This place is about Two steps below Burger King and maybe equal to eating at Ace hardware next door. ( sorry Ace , Sorry Burger King if I hurt your reputation ) 
so basically - Lousy Customer Service , Lousy inedible Food & poor customer relations. I don't know why someone asks you if you are happy, then walk away without changing or fixing the problem.  Sorry to give such a POOR REVIEW, but these guys need to fold up their tent and move . the dinner was disappointing, over priced and just a poor substitute for good food.
So sorry that I went there.

{"text":"We were really excited to experience this place based upon the reviews posted here, however when you call yourself gourmet burgers and charge at that price ps:its not cheap. 

When we got our burgers they were really small for a gourmet burger, but that i can live with if its a great tasting burger. This was not the case the Patties were small, grey, chewy and tasted frozen, it left me wishing I had gone with a  buck in and out burger. 

I will say the shake was great but that's about it. Wont be going back feel bamboozled. hope these guys take note and do better."}
{"text":"Ate there first time today! Excellent burger, great flavor, priced right. Didn't get any sides but they all looked delicious. Hope the area supports this place. Very clean. Nice staff. Easy to get to off 51/Shea exit."}
{"text":"A great local spot that offers gluten free buns for those gourmet burgers! A welcomed establishment in the 32nd & Shea neighborhood."}
{"text":"Got there about 6:55 didn't get our food until 7:40 when only 2 out of party of 3 got served. When the rest of order came it was wrong. Burgers were dry and not hot, server said the food had been ready but he couldn't find us even though we had previously asked him to wipe our table which had our order number in plain sight. One of my friends had a milkshake which he said was very thin and really just chocolate milk, he drank less than half.  When the server was clearing the table it was clear to me that he was trying to clear too much at once, the result was the remaining milkshake was spilled all over my other friend. Server apologized but it was ignored by the manager,  not sure they even have one since the entire place seemed to be in chaos."}
{"text":"My husband, parents and I ate here Wednesday evening around 6 p.m. There was already a crowd inside and people kept coming once we were seated - a very good sign.

My parents and I got the Italiano burger and my husband got the Aioli burger - all of us ordered loaded fries. There were no complaints, except for my Dad who didn't really care for the fries (but he put ketchup on them, so his fault!). Everything was really delicious and cooked well. I ordered the burgers medium to medium-rare and they were closer to medium-medium-well but they were juicy and tasty and so who cares. 

The loaded fries were $4 and you get a fair amount, but I might try an appetizer or a salad next time. Also, the lemonades are really tasty (I'm sure the shakes are too but I need to pace myself!).

Overall really delicious and since we live less than two miles away, we'll be back frequently! We might have to start walking there, though."}
{"text":"Not very good. Ordered a couple burgers and a kids burger. Asked for medium got well-done...Very well done. Buns we not very fresh and the Pattie was pretty thin. Overall a below average burger. I think I'll go to Wendy's next time for a burger. On the bright side the s'mores bread pudding was pretty good."}
{"text":"I can't imagine how anyone would rate the burgers here less than 5 stars. I had the truffle burger and it was the best burger I've ever had. I also had grilled vegetables which were fantastic, but the grilled red pepper sauce that came with them really set it off. A very simple, but fantastic tasting place."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for the 1st time this week. I was asked if I wanted \"pink\" in the middle and I said Yes. My friend asked for a protein style and said specifically NO BUN. My burger was charred, her burger was charred AND was WITH bun. the fries looked like they had been refried and sitting under the lamp for a couple of hours (we got there @ 1 p.m.). Next!"}
{"text":"This is the most incompetently run restaurant ever. Ever!

While the food is good, both visits I've made have been horrible. Complete chaos, lack of management and service. This last time I called in, got there, and paid for my food and they told me to wait for my name to be called. I waited another 10 minutes before I realized that my food had been prepared all along. I had to take the initiative, grab my bag and peace. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries good but every time I go in my order is wrong or something is missing. Even when it's slow. How is that even? I could be the only person in the building and still have missing items. Don't ask for a large fry or you'll get a small handful of fries in a burger container."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The food was pretty good. I had the black and blue
Burger and my husband had classic burger. While they tasted fine,  my husband said the small round pickles on the burger made it awkward to eat and the bun flavor was not that great. My burger was fine. While the bun was ok , it's not the best I've had. Both his golden fries my sweet potato fries were over cooked. The worst part was the restaurant itself. The seats are tiny and stupid. I saw a regular man sitting and it looked like he was sitting at the \"kids table\". I saw a 10 year old girl and the seat was just right for her. Also I almost sliiped on the floor going to the bathroom. So did my husband. I told the one gal who said she would fix it but they were way too busy to get to it. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the white truffle swiss burger and husband had the black & blue burger. Both were delicious. The loaded fries were great!  Love the avocado and pickled onions on them! Can't wait to try the other burgers and sweet potato fries. I've got my eye on those pretzel bites too. Awesome burgers, delicious loaded fries, and fresh iced tea!"}
{"text":"I've now had both the food truck and the restaurant, the food is excellent as always. Restaurant is a friendly open environment, with the fast casual approach. 

The menu has a lot of additions if that you cannot get on the Trucks.. I highly recommend you make it in and check the place out. 

Locally owned and operated by a great group of guys who grew up in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We just happened to be picking up some things from ACE hardware store, and needed to grab a bite to eat.  It was raining, and at the end of the rainbow...Aioli Gourment Burgers (photo included), so we gave this little place a try, without even checking it out first on YELP!! Yikes!!!

We were pleasantly surprised by the cute, clean environment, and the nice staff.  The burgers were amazing!  Real ground beef taste and a thick patties on a delicious bun, served in cute little metal trays.  

Definitely would like to try other items on the menu, I recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"The flavors are very interesting. I like to get takeout from there. It's a great place to pop in, grab a unique tasting meal and get on with your day. They have great cheesey fries."}
{"text":"Went to Aioli Burger with our Groupon tonight, chosen partly because they offer gluten free buns. Gluten makes me quite sick. Ordered a gluten free bun with my California burger and sweet potato fries. Order came pretty quick, fries looked delicious, so started eating them. Yikes, they were battered in flour! The lady taking our order did swap them out for regular fries quickly though when I told her. Just wished she had said something when I ordered, or that it was marked on the menu. Our burgers were OK, had good toppings, but were quite greasy. So much so that my burger buns was halfway soaked before I even started eating. Glad the neighborhood has a new eatery, but hope they can fine tune it a bit. I want them to make it!"}
{"text":"Decent burgers but I wouldn't go out of my way for them. No alcohol and a meal runs $10-15 pp.  Not sure if they were just slow tonight or what but the servers kept trying to take our plates away before we were really done. On the third try we just let them take the plates."}
{"text":"This place was a 10/10 ESPECIALLY for just a casual  burger shop!  We tried the White truffle Swiss burger, The fresh Prince specialty burger and the macaroni bites.  Everything we tried was to great to even pick a favorite, BUT the Cannoli milkshake was out of this world!  On top of that the manager gave us some fries and even an extra cannoli on top of the milkshake for us to try!  Great customer service and top notch quality food for around $30 will definitely be giving this place a big spot on the map.  And we'll definitely be coming back to watch it grow!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant tonight and we all loved it. Very delicious burgers and fries. My kids also loved the chicken fingers. My Green Chili bacon cheese burger was fantastic. Very comfortable atmosphere, friendly employees, and awesome music choice! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was very much looking forward to trying out this spot... Sadly, we weren't impressed. Burgers were average, at best. We also ordered a chicken sandwich which tasted as though it was boiled and undercooked, and had absolutely zero flavor as there wasn't even a dash of seasoning on it!!!"}
{"text":"Yes your order will take 15 minutes. What you get in return are the most amazing golden, crisp tender fries on the planet! And burgers that are not only creative but delicious every single time. And watch for the specials. I just finished the apple cranberry Brie burger (it's Thanksgiving weekend) and it was spellbinding. BIG PLUS: options for tasty gluten-free buns or a lettuce wrap. Amd even a \"Furry Friends\" side with biscuits, apples and peanut butter. Where else you gonna go?"}
{"text":"So my wife and I wanted to get a good cheeseburger and some fries, we normally go to Paradise Burger Co, Red Robin, In and Out, Five Guys, or Gordon Bersch, but decided we wanted to try something different.  So I jumped on Yelp and searched for some burger joints in our area.  That led me to Aioli Gourmet Burgers.  They are located off Shea and the 101.  The place seemed pretty clean, and kinda had a diner feel to it.  You walk up to the counter place an order and the food gets delivered to your table.  So we ordered the Pretzel Bites, loaded fries, white truffle Swiss burger, and the aioli burger and shared a strawberry milk shake.  The food was pretty good, the burger had a lot of flavor and the fries were excellent, my only knock on the burger was the size of the meat to bun ratio.  I found myself removing some of the bun, cause it was a little too much for the amount of burger meat.  I think the burger was 1/3 of a lb or a little less.  My wife enjoyed the pretzel bites, they were served piping hot with some sort of mustard and a cheese sauce, very tasty.  The milk shake was probably our least favorite.  It had a lot of whipped cream on top and was extremely thick.  Drinking it out of a straw was damn near impossible, and needed a spoon to eat it.  We let it melt down a little before we were able to drink it.

Overall, pretty solid place, I'm glad I ventured out and gave this place a try.  They have a variety of burgers and the food was pretty good.  The prices are reasonable, if you go to Zinburger or Delux, you'll drop 12 to 15 bucks on just the burger, so paying 8 or 9 bucks for a burger is pretty good.  I would recommend this place for a good burger."}
{"text":"We've been there two times and loved the service and the food we ordered. I ordered one of there specials both times, the Fresh Prince Burger and both times it was awesome!! My husband tried the Italiano and He really enjoyed it. Both times we got the fry flight and the first time it came with five different aiolis and a spicy ketchup. The second time we ordered it, it only came with four aiolis. Also the second time we went our burgers came out about five mins before our fry flight. Which was kind of annoying because we wanted the aiolis not just for our fries, but burgers as well so our burgers were cold by the time we were going to eat them. My parents who were with us were very perturbed by this. We tried a chocolate malt, the presentation was awesome and it tasted good. We'd probably try a different shake in the future.  Overall the only gripes we have are the inconsistency of getting an item and timing of getting food. It may have just been an off night that night."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had!!! The manager Karen was just amazing. We drove from fountain hills and will probably do this drive again soon. Hope they open another one close to fountain hills area."}
{"text":"I've drove by a few times the menu looked exciting. It was very slow but our food took more than 20 minutes to arrive. Our food wasn't warm and they shorted our order. It was a very unsatisfying experience. I would not go here again or recommend this place based on service or food quality..."}
{"text":"I have to say that the burgers from the food truck taste much better than the restaurant for whatever reason. We went in with a Groupon and got 2 burgers and 2 sides. The burgers were overcooked from what we asked and mostly flavorless. I got the white truffle Swiss burger which had almost no mushrooms on it and I couldn't even taste the aioli.  I'm not sure if the meat was seasoned or not but all I could taste was the caramelized onion. My brother had the California burger and agreed that the meat was flavorless. The side of roasted vegetables was actually pretty good along with the romesco sauce, but the fries seemed premade. Overall it was okay but did not seem to match the price point. There are other burger places at a similar price that I would rather have."}
{"text":"My favorite bacon cheddar burger has been at Majerle's Sports Grills around the Valley.  A bit of a drive.  And, although I live in the area of Shea/32 (as do the owners) and have for 39 years, I tried Aioli for the first time a few days ago.  It is every bit as good.  And, for a gourmet bacon cheddar burger, very reasonably priced.  The only things it can't match are Majerle's punch card for a free burger when you reach \"Thunder 9\" and its lunch discounts with the card.  And the ambiance of a fancy sports bar.  But then, it's a quicky stop at the counter for a delicious burger."}
{"text":"Was okay.  Good burger and fries.  Staff was friendly and helpful.   Kid didn't like the egg on the burger.  Overall pretty tasty."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Went back today after receiving an incredibly generous gift card and note from the manager asking to try again.  That was incredible customer service!!!  Five stars for that!!! When we got there, we were greeted immediately and the manager was very friendly.  We ordered a burrata caprese salad, an aioli burger, the special hatch green chili burger, and a chocolate malt shake.  The food came pretty quickly and it was MUCH better this time.  I chose to not do the lettuce bun this time, but the other burger was lettuce wrapped.  Burgers were cooked well, the aiolis on both were good, the burrata salad was DELICIOUS and the malt was divine!!  I think we definitely must have gone on a bad day last time because the food today was MUCH better!!!  Very much recommend the hatch chili burger and the burrata caprese salad!!  

I have been trying to eat at Aioli Burger for awhile; the first time, I called for take out and was on hold for 17 minutes (they forgot about me!) When I finally hung up, they called me back and left a message apologizing like 45 minutes later.  Then I called for takeout again a few days later and they told me they were closing in 20 minutes and wouldn't take the order.  I was getting frustrated but am doing low carb and really craved a lettuce wrap burger so called again last night.  Between two of us, we ordered: the Classic Aioli burger and the Italiano burger, both pink, both lettuce wrapped.  And we shared farmhouse veggies.  I honestly am not sure I have had a worse burger experience in a long time.  My burger (the italiano) was room temp at best, the mozz cheese was melted on top but was cold (actually cold!), the tomatoes were bad, the aioli was bland.  And the lettuce, my goodness!  It was like that lettuce you used to get as a garnish on your dishes at Shoneys back in the 90s!  And the bacon, no joke, tasted like a hotdog.  The other burger was better, the onion jam was delicious.  I will say they were both cooked well, as in were actually pink, though mine was not warm.  (I do realize there is a slight risk of this when you order takeout so I can actually understand that to an extent).  Then...the veggies...oh the veggies.  I literally threw them away!!  I think they are frozen veggies that get thrown into a microwave and then come w some sauce that has literally no flavor.  It was just not good.  I feel bad because I REALLY wanted to like this place but I definitely had a bad experience.  I think all bad reviews deserve a second chance so I'll try it again next time in the restaurant and see if that makes a difference.  I will say, the fries looked delvi"}
{"text":"Had the white truffle burger. It was good, but a bit sweet from the sauce, which was still tasty. The loaded fries are really good, but a bit on the salty side. Overall, it hit the spot and I would recommend this place to others. The food came out quickly. The lady at the register was nice. Place was clean."}
{"text":"Just tried Aoli Burgers and was very happy with the overall experience. Service was fast and friendly. My burger was excellent seared on the outside and pink inside. The restaurant was clean and welcoming.  I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The Italiano burger is Top notch!! Hands down the best burger in town. I frequent Aioli as much as I can when I am in town. The staff is always friendly and remembers me by name. Love how they are expanding the menu with speciality burgers. The restaurant is always spotless and the burger is just as good as the last time. True consistency hats off to the chef."}
{"text":"I'm adding up to 4 or 5 visits to AGB, I've lost count. It's hard to count when you're always leaving in a state of bliss. The Aioli fry flight features five different yummy dipping sauces and a good size basket of perfect fries. When dining alone I indulge in burger dipping to great tasting effect. The burgers aren't necessarily huge, but sooo tasty and I need room for those fries! Vintage sodas in a case out front, my favorite brand of iced tea China Mist, and outstanding chocolate malt are some of the satisfying drinks I've enjoyed here. That's just the food, ownership places huge value on service! The young folks that work there treat you like family at the kitchen counter. You get that same personal touch no matter how crowded it gets. So yeah, I like em."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick burger.   Kid running the cashier didn't know what he was doing... seemed new.  So ok.   

First thing to come out was our strawberry shake.  Which was delicious!  

Next the fries came out.   Regular coated like warm fries.   Disappointed!  Truffle aioli was ok.   House ketchup was Heinz jazzed up a little bit... maybe?   Loaded fried has cheese wiz on them?  Also warm not hot.  

Last our burgers came out.   I got the boring classic... I like to see if a place can mess up the basic.   Again lukewarm.   Average flavor.   

Overall a very blah experience.  The shake was the highlight.   

Prob won't go back."}
{"text":"Great food, clean little place!
Wife had the Italian burger and I had the Aioli burger. Both were large (had to take half home!)

Buns were excellent and loaded with a good mix of condiments.

The sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly. I has the waitress \"surprise me\" with her choice of side.... She chose the fully loaded fries. OMG!!! Pickled onions, aioli sauce, bacon bits.  Great tastes and textures.

Great food... We'll be back!"}
{"text":"What an amazing atmosphere. We brought our grandparents here while they were in town from florida..they were NOT let down! They even tried some new ingredients on a burger that us \"funky age kids\" eat.. like an egg? Delish! The staff was so amazing... clean tables, floors and walls (yes I look at those things). The food was brought to us quickly and the milkshakes... oh so fantastic. We had kids ages munchkin to 10 with us.. they were entertained and ate all of their food.. which was a miracle. This was our second visit but a million more in the future.. do you have a punch card lol? Thanks Aioli team.. you have outdone yourself"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Kind of gourmet, hence the name. So over half the stuff isn't for me. But keep it simple, and get the loaded fries. Man those good. Burgers are a descent size. You'd pay the same at Hardee's roughly. This place is worth the extra 1-2$. 
Regular fries are great. The aioli garlic sauce is terrific."}
{"text":"Great food and exceptional, friendly service! They've got some unique flavors, but I'm so stuck on the aioli burger and fries with white truffle sauce that I haven't gotten around to trying them."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Yummy sweet potato fries. Easy menu to choose from. Offers gluten free buns. Plus they sell many different bottles of aioli sauce you can take home."}
{"text":"Such good service and really the best quality food. I was taken back by how attentive they were. I had the aioli burger and loaded fries. Considering how good it tasted and the quantity of food, the prices were also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Clean, easy to find and park, very tasty! We shared the Mushroom truffle and aioli burgers, fries, and the Mexican street corn. We loved everything and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've never really been a burger person but these burgers are by far the best! I've had this place twice and I will continue coming back for their California burger and sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"OMG and I don't use that work but wow got there New Ahi Tuna Burger and wow this is the best. Even better than Sammy shops in SoCal or no Cal.  And I like fish tacos. This hit the spot and the help here is great.  Got that Hailee again she was nice and helpful and said I would like this and I did. 

This again. Danny"}
{"text":"I heard of this place when it was just a food truck but never got around to trying it out. This may not be the best review because it's been over a week since we've gone here but I can tell you that it's a place I'll visit again. 

I went with the White Truffle Swiss burger with sweet potato fries and my fiance decided on the California burger with regular fries. The young lady that helped us with our order told us that they had a $10 special going on that included the fries so it was nice that we were both able to get the fries we enjoy for a deal. 

I thought my burger was very enjoyable and would get it again. The sweet potato fries were perfectly crisp and not limp like some other burger joints. 

Brian said his burger was not memorable. He said he is willing to come back and try the Italiano burger. We also didn't care for the aioli dipping sauce either. 

The place is tucked away in the corner of the plaza and there isn't a lighted sign with their name up so look for the banner."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the Golden Fries at all - felt like I was eating a bag of under cooked frozen fries. However, with the bad stuff out of the way, everything else still has my wife and me wanting to go back and I've told others to try them out, less the Golden Fries. My wife had the Aioli and I had the White Truffle Swiss. Both were very good, lots of flavor but very well balanced. The Roasted Farm Vegetables were also surprisingly very good as a side dish - brussel sprouts, cauliflower and some other good stuff. This place also had some amazing variety of strawberry lemonade that is just the right sweetness. The burgers, drinks and outside patio alone are worth the visit."}
{"text":"We love Aioli!  So happy you moved into our neighborhood!  The burgers we've tried (so far aioli and bbq) are so yummy!  We could probably split one and be full but we don't!  Who wants to share?  These are not petite little burgers...these are the kind that require a handful of napkins and some time. ;-)  My son also loves your chicken and fries which is a sizable portion!  The fries (regular and sweet potatoes) are on point!  We also had the smores bread pudding!  It's a wonder we fit out the door.  Soo good!  Thank you and welcome to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this new spot a try after seeing many Facebook friends raving about the opening of a physical location and was not disappointed in the least. The wait was long but to be fair it was a Friday night, and is still very new. But! The wait was well worth it. Not only because of the delicious burgers and fries; The best I've had in a long while. But also due to the friendliness and caring attitude of the staff. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"All in all, we had a great experience with aioli. The burger was clean and really tasty... we got the Italian burger. We also ordered the mac n cheese bites, and loaded fries. The only reason I couldn't give it five stars is because everything had way too much sauce. Don't get me wrong, I love to have sauce and typically ask for extra from places I know that don't give you enough. Unfortunately, all of their dishes we received were almost overpowered. Other than that, great place!"}
{"text":"Mushroom Swiss truffle burger was great.  And a side of loaded fires to top it off.  Will be back"}
{"text":"OK I have been here a few times and each time some sort of issues.  First two times the service was extremely slow, second time the mac and cheese bites were cold in the middle and the forth time was fine except the tea as always.   Need to clean the tea containers it is always bitter."}
{"text":"I grew up in this area and just heard about it while I'm on Military leave. I never leave reviews but this food is amazing. The store is clean and staff is very enthusiastic, polite, and accommodating. I will come back every time I am back in Phoenix. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow this place improved from the the last time we were there. The meat was much fresher tasting and buns were not dried out.The meat was cooked how I asked some pink and some well done.  The guy at the register seemed to know how to place the order and was very energetic. I ordered the Italian burger with roasted veggies sometimes normally would not but soooo glad I did. I still got to try everyone else's fries which were hot and tasty but I felt like the roasted veggies were such a tasty unique and healthy side choice! Loved the balsamic glaze and motzerreIla  I didn't even miss the usual ketchup mustard pickle..wish other burger places would do this. Only complaint we wanted all aioli on the side in case we don't eat whole meal but it was put on it. Looking forward to our next visit keet up the quality of meat !!"}
{"text":"Such great food!  Great atmosphere!  So glad to have this place in our neighborhood!  We will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"I was absolutely blown away with how these guys and their staff handled themselves on a trial run of 3 seatings of 60+ people and how spot on the food came out. They're gonna really add a lot to the community! I'm so happy they have their first brick n mortar in my neighborhood and where they all grew up. Still running the trucks and handling full catering too! I'm so excited to have them in the hood!!!"}
{"text":"The worst experience and lack of service I have ever encountered in the food industry!!! If there were zero stars to give, THATS what this place deserves! 

I heard this place has great food and decided to check it out. My mistake had no idea that they close at 8:00 and we literally walked in at 7:59 and we're behind people ordering and when they were done ordering we thought we were next! We approached the counter and the young girl behind the counter told us she cannot take our order because they close at 8:00! I looked at the time and it was 8:02 ARE YOU KIDDING? She told us the people before us were the last order ( even though we were in line behind them) and \"That's coming from the chef\" is what she told us! I cannot believe that they would turn us away and not even offer to make our food to go! As good as they may be, I cannot see myself supporting an establishment with this type of culture! We drove out of our way and were turned away! We will go to our usual burger joint with EXCELLENT service called Hopdoddy!"}
{"text":"This is our second time to Aioli Burger, and as they are newly opened, I understand that there will be some growing pains. Our first time was so good, so we tried again, once again on a busy weekend night. First the good - the Italiano burger is so consistently good, and we love the loaded fries. The truffle burger was solid, and the chocolate shake was delicious. The meh - while the wait wasn't bad, it appeared that there were numerous other customers waiting for to-go orders that had been waiting a while and were obviously not pleased. Doesn't strike a lot of confidence as we're placing a to-go order, though I didn't find the wait too long. What was disconcerting is that we didn't get a receipt, so we had no idea how long we waited. We didn't get a number either, so we really had to sit and hope they did in fact have our orders. I somehow feel more assured with a receipt in hand, but I even asked and they said that I would get a receipt at the end. We didn't, so even now I have no idea how long we waited or how much our bill was. Irritating, but not a deal-breaker - they obviously need to figure out a better system for to-go orders. And finally the terrible - I can overlook a lot of managerial issues, but I want all of my food to be at least passable (and to be fair, most of our food was exceptional). I had raved last time about the kids meals - I was impressed by both the chicken fingers and kids burger. I ordered chicken fingers for my kids again, and unfortunately, they were inedible, even to my kids who routinely enjoy stale cheerios and things that fall on the floor. They looked nothing like the chicken fingers from last time; these were dry and overcooked and overall not good. We threw them all away, which is sacrilege in my household. Will I go back? Definitely. Am I a bit disappointed? Yep. Hopefully this was an anomaly as this is right in our favorite area."}
{"text":"I ordered a UberEats and the driver didn't pick up the food for 30 min after it was ready. The manager was nice enough to call, explain the issue and inform me the remade my burger so it wasn't cold. Seems like good people, now just need to visit the store in person."}
{"text":"First time eating here and let me just say the food is AMAZEBALLS!!!!. My favorite though was the mac and cheese bites. I love my mac and cheese! The California burger and the Mexican burger was so delicious. Would have never thought putting an egg on it and then the yoke going everywhere as you cut into the burger the yolk went everywhere, but in a fantastic way!. I finished off with my Dr. Pepper ...definitely a wonderful Fathers Day. Thankyou so much and I truly give you 10 stars!!!!!!."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious burgers,  toppings and crispy,  perfectly done French and sweet potato fries.  If you are a bacon lover get the double Aoli burger and ask for extra cheese.   The outdoor seating is perfect for the pooches and after 3PM this time of year the weather is perfect. 

The only complaint I have,  is a common problem with every outdoor seating restaurant in Phoenix and PV,  the flies.   Unless the owners fog their patio and use strong repellant candles,  this time of year you will have to keep your food covered in napkins as you eat.  I am even to the point with outside seating to bring my own spray and douse the table before eating. 

You will love the burgers,  coke products and friendly staff here,  just bring a little deet :)"}
{"text":"Aioli was pretty good, but...at their price point, I don't think they match up to the other burger joints in that category.  

If they were priced about 35% lower, I'd bump them up to a 4 star.

The burger was good.  The sweet potato fries were good.  
But, that was it...just good.  
And $14 for lunch?  Without a drink?  
It needs to be stellar, and it just wasn't."}
{"text":"Finally...a good burger place in my neighborhood. We went on a Thursday night and it was fairly busy but luckily we were able to grab a small table. I had the Italiano burger with chicken and my husband had the white truffle Swiss burger. Both were delicious! The fries on the other hand could have used another minute in the fryer to crisp up. The strawberry basil lemonade was amazing! 

Service was friendly. Dinner for two ran us about $31.00 not including tip.

We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I eat a loooooot of fast food burgers and I can say with certainty this place was really really good! I enjoyed the thousand island burger. Beef had great flavor. Toppings fresh. Quality pickles, fresh like in and out but cut thin like McDonalds. 

I'll be back. Often."}
{"text":"Unassuming place in the middle of a Scottsdale strip mall.  Amazing burgers and interesting lemonade concoctions.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yelp review 

Aioli Gourmet Burger surely did not disappoint. We drove 30 mins to give them a try & were very happy with our findings. The burgers were delicious & the service wonderful! We ordered the special & the Mexican & they both were cooked perfectly & full of flavor. There is a wide selection of different gourmet burgers to meet anyone's taste. And we are positive that every one of them will be awesome. We can't wait to go back & sample more burgers."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and the next time you're brain storming on where to eat out- choose Aioli Burgers. I love supporting local in AZ and am so happy to see a store front come out of this successful business. 

We dined on a Monday afternoon and the place was busy, a great sign! All of the food came out so quick, we were both super impressed! My boyfriend had the California burger- BOMB. I had the classic burger to start with, but the next time I come back I will surely try one of their specialty burgers! We also got the wedge salad, and the loaded fries...... make sure you order the loaded fries.

Clean, spacious restaurant with friendly service.
They have gluten free and vegan options as well!

I think the best part about this business is their reasonable pricing for the quality of food their putting out. Every other burger joint in AZ charges so much to add an extra sauce or topping to your burger, and Aoili does this reasonably. Every single thing we ordered was so worth it.

Great job, Aoili Burger!!!! I look forward to eating your delicious food again soon, and I will make sure to tell everyone I know in the area and beyond about this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and more!  Try the Italiano burger!  One of the best burgers I have ever had. I also tried the mac and cheese bites as well as the s'mores dessert.  Sooo good.  Get here fast so you can be one of the first to experience this great place.  The staff was friendly and everything is new and clean."}
{"text":"Best hamburger I've had anywhere in Arizona. Love this place and the staff. Creative innovative and excellent product."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the aioli burger food truck for a while and finally stopped into the restaurant. Same great service and same great food. I'm really happy they've returned to the 32nd st and shea neighborhood. 

My only gripe is the French fries didn't seem like they were made fresh. A place as creative and food quality focused as this shouldn't fall short on something so easy. I hope it was just an off night, I will be back to double check."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this hidden gem today for lunch. The burger was amazing. Well cooked (a little pink in the center), well seasoned (not over-seasoned), great condiments (Aioli garlic mayo) serious bacon and cheddar. Brioche bun fresh baked and tasty. All in all, best burger I've had in a long, long time. Got their basic burger for first time. Will be back to try some others."}
{"text":"The service is good, and welcoming... To me that's personally always a priority. Sadly, the burger was not that good. Maybe it was just that I was expecting a lot more based on comments. My friend thought the burger was too greasy, so I told her, that's a great sign of a great burger... Then she told me the sweet onions were way too sweet, and I got nothing :/ I run out of excuses. Mine was ok. Not much wrong with it. Only that it tasted like something I would make. But I do encourage people to go give it a try for themselves. I saw people working hard to serve, clean tables, keep up the place, and customers happy, meaning they love what they do and that means a lot."}
{"text":"We had the food truck cater a birthday party and it was great!  food is fantastic, they did a great job of getting orders done fast and keeping the line moving.  staff was very polite and professional"}
{"text":"Amazing place to get a burger and hang out. Great atmosphere, I came here with a couple friends to celebrate their 1 year anniversary. They had buy 1 get 1. I got the black and blue and the California burger. The burgers were amazing, by far the best burgers in town. Service was great, food came out fresh and time was reasonable. I will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Updated: I finally came back! I went in during early lunch and was greeted right away. 

I ordered the Italiano burger and WOW! I absolutely love this burger! I'm obsessed, it was soooooo good.  I got the farm vegetables on the side and I loved that too. I love that there's a healthy option for veggies instead of fries! 

This time around really impressed me."}
{"text":"I have dined here on several occasions. They make a great burger. I am especially glad that they opened in my neighborhood. If you do order a dinner be certain to order the mixed vegetables. They are probably better than the burger itself. 

I would give a five star, but the service can be slow at times. 

Give it a try you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good: 
The sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly and the white truffle aioli was delicious.  My husband got the loaded fries and I was literally scraping every last morsel of the yummy cheese off of the dish!  We also had a sample of the lemonade and it was very tasty.

And the bad:  
I ordered the Italiano burger.  The burger was by far the weakest part of the meal.  While the seasonings and cheese were good, the actual burger patty itself was bland and somewhat dry. I prefer my beef patties flavored and juicy.  It was almost inedible.  And I love bread, but the bun was too big and not that appetizing.  I ended up only eating a portion of the bun.

Overall:
The restaurant is cute and I like supporting local businesses.  I would go back to have sides and or appetizers (I want to try the mac&cheese, as well as the pretzels).  However, I would never pay such a steep price for a less than mediocre hamburger!  

5 Stars for sides
2 Stars for the burger"}
{"text":"This is a casual burger place where you order at the counter, get your drink and seat yourself. I tried the Falafel Burger with lettuce wrap instead of bun and for one dollar up charge I got the 3 Cheese Macaroni and Cheese Bites. It seemed like they hollowed out a WHOLE lettuce head for my sandwich (see photo) I adjusted the amount of lettuce and for the most part the Falafel Sandwich and Bites were delicious.....but then things go south fast.

We shared the Roasted Farm Vegetables. (see photo)
They looked like broken down leftovers that were full of grease and were sort of burnt. The vegetables came with a very non-traditional romesco. (romesco is suppose to be a red pepper nut sauce)

My husband asked for his Aioli Burger with the aioli on the side but that request was ignored so he sent it back. Big mistake...I don't know what they did but it seemed like they washed the burger off and threw it back on the heat......because.....
Instead of a \"Pink\" Burger (you order pink or well) he received a petrified burger and pulled it out of his sandwich and said to me that it was dryer than a Burger King Patty and too dry to feed our dogs. The girl working the counter said that she was sorry but it wasn't her fault because she ordered the burger correctly.

The other girl from the kitchen came out to clear the plates saw the dried up burger and said she'd make a new one but we were passing out the door to leave so we just left.

Aioli Burger made Delicious Fresh Burgers at the past Devoured Festival....I thought they'd be just as good from the restaurant but I was wrong."}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out. They have a good selection on their menu. I asked the cashier which burgers were the most popular. She mentioned the \"Dad\" burger and insisted it was good. This is a bacon cheeseburger with a peanut butter and sirracha sauce. I was hesitant but she convinced me to try it.

To my surprise it was very good. A little messy, but worth it. The French fries were quite good as well. I had an unsweetened ice tea with my meal and it was brewed to the proper strength. 

This is a place I will return to."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm a huge fan of the Aioli Gourmet Burger truck and to see they had a restaurant opening I was beyond thrilled! Once I arrived at the restaurant I was happy to see they expanded their menu so many more options to choose from!! The mac and cheese bites are super yummy along with the pretzel bites! Oh and the chocolate lovers shake is a serious must have!! My food was served fast and Hot! I highly recommend stopping in for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"One of the top best burgers I've ever had! Let's start that it's Kobe beef fresh made to order, this place just took first place in the battle of the burgers challenge and also recently won best food in the recent scottsdale culinary festival! I decided to try and it definitely lived up to its reputation. I ordered the prince which consisted of a Kobe beef patty (I ordered a extra patty) with shaved rib eye on top caramelized onions their famous Aioli spread fresh aged cheddar on delicious toasted brioche bun yummy goodness dripping down your hands! Great people the owner greeted us at the register n was very hospitable. If you're a burger lover You gotta try it!!"}
{"text":"Very good burger, cooked well with a great bun. Fries were ok, I wish I had tried the sweet potato instead of regular. Quick, fast and cute. I didn't know they had just opened when I went in but they were doing great. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Juicy tasty burgers with a rich unique taste. I definitely will visit again. I had the Aioli burger which was cooked just right. My friend had the Italiano burger. He really enjoyed it. The service was friendly. And the manager asked us if we liked it. Great price considering the size of the burger. We were filled up for sure."}
{"text":"OMFG!!!!! I just had the best veggie burger of my life! You must try the falafel burger with arugula! I can't even tell you how amazing this masterpiece is! Thank you Chef, for creating this amazing, mouth watering, joyful experience! 
P.S. The atmosphere is really cool, and there's an awesome portrait of Jules from Pulp Fiction!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, nice flavors, but the wait for our food was really long (like almost an hour) although the restaurant wasn't crowded at all."}
{"text":"Aioli Burger is my favorite burger joint in AZ! I love this place. Like many others, I discovered this company by visiting their food truck several years ago. I was excited when I heard about their brick and mortar restaurant and they have lived up to the hype. Consistently great food and service, clean restaurant, and convenient location. I always get the Black and Blue burger which is amazing, so flavorful. Their golden fries are also quite good, just the right amount of crispy and they pair perfectly with your choice of aioli dipping sauce (my favorite is the white truffle!). I'm not the biggest fan of their milkshakes but the food more than makes up for that. I would absolutely recommend Aioli Burger!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service. Josh was great...i wanted to set him up with my daughter!  

Anyhow, the food....well we shared the Swiss Mushroom truffle burger and the loaded fries. Ridiculous!!!  It was so good that I didnt even feel guilty eating it at a table outside with a view of the gym next door and watching people working out.  4 of us shared the bread pudding too. It was a huge serving, really good but super rich. We could only eat a couple of bites and brought the rest home. 

Oh, my other daughter and her friend got the kids chicken fingers and fries and they enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"The burger was good but I unfortunately can't say it was great...just tasted like any other burger. Their fries are amazing though and I would stop in again just for those. Worth a try for everyone...it might be right up your alley."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience. The food is amazing and the staff is the friendliest I have ever met. Not your ordinary burgers well worth the trip and price."}
{"text":"I recently wrote a review raving about The Paradise Valley Burger Co. I even called them the best burger joint in town. After eating at Aioli Burger, I think I may have to make some edits to that review. Aioli Burger was a little better and priced better than Paradise Valley Burger. The California burger and the Truffle burger were both phenomenal. The roasted veggies were awesome and the golden fries were also delightful. Why did I not know about this place sooner?"}
{"text":"Aioli is my spot for burgers!! Fresh , delicious and recommend it to everyone! Very clean restaurant , great customer service the food is on point . I discovered them from the food truck they had at an event and couldn't be happier! CHECK IT OUT !!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a big disappointment for me. The food was mediocre and looked nothing like the Instagram pictures. For example I ordered the Chocolate Lovers shake, which on Instagram has all these chocolate toppings like whoppers, chocolate chips, and brownies. They give you just a regular chocolate watered down shake. I asked them about it and they didn't care to make it right but tried to add stuff to it (chocolate chips). Because the shake was so watered down you can imagine where the chocolate chips ended. This wasn't the first problem either. The person who took our ordered asked how I wanted my burger no pink or just a lil pink. I said a lil pink, I got mostly pink. It was gross. I thought to myself when our food came out, that it was really quick for being a burger. The amount of pink proved why it came out so quick.The price was not worth the trip or the food. I wish I could have gotten all my money back. Fortunately, I did get the money for the burger back. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"This is a top burger destination. It is a gourmet burger, yet affordable and enjoyable place!

Their menu is simple and easy to choose from. Being a semi-vegetarian, we opted for the falafel burger as that looked interesting along with seasoned fries and farm fresh veggie roast. The falafel burger was fantastic - the chickpea was smashed well and the patty was well cooked. To go along with it, it was served with a side of smoked chilli pepper sauce..it was like Mexico meets Middle East! The loaded fries were delicious - so fresh and crispy that we finished off the whole bowl (and usually we seldom finish half the given plate)...very tempting and addictive fries. The farm fresh veggies were a blend of cauliflower, peppers and Brussel sprouts and were roasted to perfection. If you need a usual hamburger, I hear that is just divine here and the most popular is their signature aioli burger.
The staff is very friendly here and they take care of you really well. There are Groupon coupons that you can take advantage  of..so don't forget that. I will definitely come here again!

{"text":"Went in today for lunch and I was totally in for a treat! I had the fresh prince burger (one of the special burgers that they are promoting right now) with a platter of French fries to share. My Girlfriend has the Italiano burger which she says was amazing. The service was outstanding. I was constantly asked if I needed anything and they even brought over different sauces to dip our fries in. After our meal I ordered a Oops! All berries shake which was so so good! I really loved my meal here and will definitely be back again. This is such a nice small cozy restaurant and it feels like they really put work into the food they serve and have pride. Don't hesitate and go right in and you will be surprised with your meal. Thanks Aioli's!"}

{"text":"Like the different flavors and was thrilled to try the fries, but sweet potato fries were burnt and the fries my son got were horrible. I didn't even want him to eat them. 

The flavors would work great if the meat was flavorful. The patty definitely seem like it had been frozen no flavor at all so took a lot of flavor from the rest of the burger. The sauces to dip weren't that great. 

The lemonade was good! And the place looked cute. 

But if the food isn't good then what's the point? Sorry wouldn't even recommend the plac"}

I had the Italian burger, did I mention the delicious lemonade?? Mango! So good.  Bring your friends and family!!

{"text":"Pricing is very high for the quality. My California hamburger and sweet potato fries cost over $15.00.  They should not be charging table service prices for a \"quick service\" restaurant. Sweet potato fries were served cold and burger was not moist or juicy even after waiting over 15 minutes for my order to go. This is my third visit here and they seem to not be able to serve any hot fresh food when they get busy."}

The aioli sauces are fabulous (especially the truffle aioli) and burgers melt in your mouth!!!!!!   The salads are wonderful and despite the amazing fries they even have roasted veggies!!! We have been there multiple times and have been extremely happy with every experience."}

The burger was really good, but the fries were not and the five different Aioli sauces weren't that great either. The price for the two items were $14 - a little high, but I wouldn't mind the price if I loved the food. After about ten minutes after eating, my stomach was a little upset. Not sure if it was the Aioli sauces or the burger. Either way, I didn't feel good so I'm not sure if I will be back."}

{"text":"If you have read any of my reviews, you will notice that I am a big fan of these guys' food trucks.  When they opened a restaurant, you know I had to go!  This restaurant has some nice burger themed art and a very modern feel to the space.  I love the fast casual set up where there are no servers.  Makes it easy to get in and get out.  

For our first foray into the restaurant, I had my standard (black & blue burger) and my wife got the italiano.  For sides, we got the mac & cheese bites and the aioli fry flight.  

Burgers were fantastic per the usual.  This was the first time I tried the italiano burger and I have to give that one two thumbs up.  The mac & cheese bites are a welcome addition to their already stellar menu.  

This is a great neighborhood restaurant and can only be improved by adding some booze to the menu!"}
{"text":"Vegan review: Aioli Burgers offers the Beyond Burger as a vegan option! It's so nice to have a neighborhood place that we can eat at!

There has been some discussion on Facebook about if their buns are vegan or not, but I stopped by for some emergency fries (I was starving) a week ago and someone who seemed like an owner or manager told me the buns are vegan. As a result, I went back to try the burger this week!

The restaurant offers a variety of toppings, but as a vegan I just started with the \"classic\" minus cheese and dressing. The server was great about making suggestions, so I added grilled onions, ketchup and mustard. I was also clear with her that I'm vegan, and she said she'd mark the ticket so they'd cook it on a clean grill. I also ordered fries.

The burger was delicious! I had it cooked well done, but it was still pink because, well, it's not meat! It was nice and warm inside, but perfectly grilled outside. I've had the Beyond Burger at home before and thought it was just okay, but having it professionally grilled made a big difference! All the toppings were good. The grilled onions were thin and flavorful, and a generous portion. I should have asked for extra pickles, as there were only a couple. The bun was warm and soft. I do have a bit of doubt on if it was vegan or not - it seemed a bit eggy. The fries are perfect. They're lightly coated in what I assume was corn starch, and fried to a crisp. 

The service was excellent! The server noticed that I was sharing with my husband, who arrived after me, and offered to have the kitchen split the burger. The food came out quickly, and the server brought an extra tray for us to divide the food.

The only thing stopping me from making this a five star review is that I'd like to see them add more vegan options i.e. vegan cheese and maybe some interesting sauces/aiolis? I was sad to have to stick to ketchup and mustard. If they did, I'd probably become a regular!"}
{"text":"Delish! Definitely going back! Great burgers...bright, fun atmosphere. Dog friendly! They even have a menu for your pup! Can't wait to go back and save some room for dessert."}
{"text":"Great food, juicy tender Kobe beef burger served in several options. I got the White truffle w/ Swiss cheese mushrooms & grilled onion with a slight hint of aioli served in lettuce. My guy got the Italian Burger w/ marinara sauce & a bunch of other yummies, pancetta, mozzarella & garlic aioli. We also split the street corn (so good, it's taste like candy) & the sweet potato flight with all the sauces. And they're dog friendly with a little menu for your fur baby as well. 

A great burger with a very friendly & personable staff. 

We're moving today & these burgers will sustain us thru the big move."}
{"text":"This place opened yesterday and is legit. Most unique list of burgers that I have seen in a minute, and the food quality is outstanding. Had the Italiano Burger (mozzarella, pancetta, balsamic reduction, and basil garlic aioli), loaded fries (cheddar, pepper jack, avocado, pickled onions, and chipotle aioli), and a mango lemonade. Probably need to expect a wait for dinner, because the word is already out. It is BYOB with a liquor store next door, so hit that up, too."}
{"text":"Aioli has been making rounds on food truck circuit for quite some time now. However, it wasn't until I found out that they opened an actual location did we actual go out of our way to finally give them a try.

The concept is pretty straight-forward. They serve burgers, fries, and few appetizers, as well as a few desserts/shakes. I guess what sets them apart, or what is supposed to set them apart, is their variety of aioli-based sauces that they use. I get it. I've always liked aioli, but in comparison to a lot of other burger places, I wasn't quite as blown away as I had hoped.

My girlfriend and I ordered their 3 cheese mac and cheese bites, which are pretty self-explanatory and actually pretty good for what they are. 

For burgers, I opted for the California, while my girlfriend ordered the basic Aioli burger. When ordering, they ask if you want your burger cooked as \"pink or no pink.\" Now, I'm all for steaks to be cooked in the medium range, but when it comes to actual ground beef, I've just never been comfortable with anything below medium-well. Therefore, we both played it safe and went with \"no pink.\"

Now, I'm not sure if this is where we went wrong, but I'll reiterate what another reviewer said when they referred to their patties as \"petrified.\" All the juice and flavor were apparently cooked right out of them, leaving us with two very dry beef patties that, despite having acceptable ingredients, were really just no different than any other mid-tier fast food burger.

This seems very odd, as many places are able to cook their burgers well-done and still manage to contain flavor and juice, so I'm not entirely sure what went wrong here.

Afterwards, I was looking at their price points and see that they're actually charging similar prices to what you'd find at a more upscale burger joint. So, clearly they see themselves on par with your \"gourmet\" joints around the Valley. Although after trying them, I don't consider them to be anywhere close to that level.

There were positives, however. The fries were fine. The lady who took our order was very friendly and we were checked on quite regularly.

In the end, I'm not sure if I'd come back, but I guess they're worth trying out. Judging by their reviews, a lot of people seem to love them - but sadly, I'm just not one of them.

Bottom line: avoid their \"no pink\" patties at all costs!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Everything is really fresh and the burgers are delicious. Really creative recipes but also some simple ones for the traditional Burger lover. The sweet potato fries are to die for and the fried macaroni and cheese is great. I've also eaten at an event were these guys catered the food and they did an awesome job. Just overall a great place"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome spot to grab a burger. Always friendly, the burgers and fries are awesome, and the shakes are good too! Feels like a locals secret even though they have some food trucks around town too"}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious. We started with the pretzel bites that came with dipping cheese and mustard.  The vanilla shake was very good.  I would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and so far I am impressed. The burger was good, the fries amazing and the shakes out of this world....

they have a great staff!"}
{"text":"Tried Aioli Burgers for the first time tonight. First impression walking in, smelled like a bbq. That's a great thing! We ordered burgers, sides and some starters. Everything tasted great. As for the Aioli, I'll say this: get everything on the side. Sounds high maintenance. Just do yourself the favor. I love condiments. I'm a fat girl that likes to dip my food into all kinds of side sauces. But Aioli may have been even more than I could handle. I liked the food and will probably go back if in that area. But I will get all sauces on the side and ever ask if the loaded fries can be adjusted.
The Blonde working at the register was probably one of the nicest, friendliest person I've run into in awhile. Very helpful, friendly and seemed to care if we liked what we ordered. That was a nice change."}
{"text":"These burgers are the real deal! My personal favorite is the Italiano. I must say it's probably one of the best burgers I ever had. I love that the owners are some local boys that set up shop right in the neighborhood they grew up in. Keep up the good work Aioli crew!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at one of the Aioli food trucks and enjoyed the food, so we just had to give their store front a shot.

This place is right down the street in a plaza that has been cleaned up and looks great. I was impressed with how clean this place is when we first walked in. There was no line so we ordered right away. The woman behind the counter was very helpful and answered all of our questions. I decided to go with their Classic burger and an order of fries.

The food came very quickly and I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into it. The hamburger was hot and fresh... made to order. However, I thought the hamburger could have used more flavor. There was just nothing setting it apart from the others in the hamburger game. The fries were great. They were salty and hot, a nice compliment to the burger.

Overall, this was a great meal for a quick dinner. I would like to return to try some of their other hamburgers."}
{"text":"Burgers here are really good. Although it's a order at the counter spot the price adds up pretty quickly. Two burgers, drinks and fries costs about $30-$40. If you're looking for a gourmet burger in a very casual atmosphere and don't mind paying $8-$10 for a burger this place is a great option!"}
{"text":"I am always searching for the perfect cheeseburger and I found it with a Aoli Burgers! I have never tasted anything so delicious and fresh and unique-all of their different burgers are magnificent!  The french fries are also off the charts delicious and I'm a sucker for a great milkshake like they have.I suggest to everyone that loves a good burger!"}
{"text":"The burgers at Aioli Gourmet Burgers are so good! If I could I would eat here every week but I would probably have a heart attack . I hope people support this locally owned restaurant. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Smells disgusting! Staff is dirty. Place is wiped down with smelly rags staff go from touching rags to pants to plates"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.  Best burger I have had in Arizona.  Ordered the Black and Blue burger with the loaded fries.  $12.00 total and barely got through half of it.  I'm a big man and it was that filling. The flavors are gourmet to the core and it's obvious care and time is put into each burger.
Highly recommended and will absolutely be back and tell as many people as I can about it."}
{"text":"Great burger, good price, friendly people. Cute interior, nothing fancy. I got the Aioli Burger, which was juicy and flavorful. I especially loved the apple wood bacon jam, which was full of bacon! I got it served without the bun and it held up really well. My husband go the classic Aioli with no Aioli sauce, and apparently he felt it lacked flavor. I didn't think my burger did, so not sure if the patty itself is different, but I can only vouch for mine and it was great. The fries were also delicious...cooked perfectly and well salted. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Aioli Gourmet Burger with a friend this past weekend and from the moment we walked in the door we had a great experience.  We were greeted warmly and since it was our first time visiting, the gal who greeted us took the time to review several things on their menu and offered some terrific suggestions.  My friend and I ordered two different burgers and split them (Black & Blue and the California) and both were delicious.  We also split an order of Aioli's Fry Flight with the sweet potato fries and they were out of this world!  If I said everything wonderful I experienced during this visit, this review would be 5 pages long!  I will most definitely be going back again and again to this restaurant. One final thing...for those who love food trucks....they also have a food truck! There's a calendar on their website that shows when/where it will be."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night at 615 and no tables were available. Always a good sign. Had the mac and cheese bites with chipotle to start, they were excellent. Then the Italiano Burger. Beyond excellent. It was delicious. 
The front counter staff seemed a little frazzled but it was busy so understandable. 
Not much on decor and the table and chairs were a bit off matched but just nitpicking because you go out to eat for the food, which was great. 
Good job guys"}
{"text":"Good cozy place. Burgers are a little pricey but are made with premium ingredients and taste awesome."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  Really great burgers and grilled veggies.  You guys have eExcellent service. Keep up the good work and excellent food."}
{"text":"The guys catered an employee appreciation luncheon and did 75 plates in about an hour. Burgers are big, quality beef and condiments."}
{"text":"I ordered the falafel burger, and was stoked that there was something vegetarian on the menu!!! It was good but waaaaaay too much curry...the curry powder overpowered every other element on my plate. Could do without or with much less. My boyfriend had a classic cheeseburger and really, really enjoyed it. We shared the aioli flight and were so excited...but slightly disappointed when it came out. The fries were unbelievably delicious! But all of the aiolis looked the exact same... a dull tan color...honestly not that appetizing. Furthermore, there was zero indication of which sauce was which flavor and I couldn't even tell by taste. Would skip the flight next time. 

The young, blonde woman who took our order (and was basically running the place by herself) was delightful! Very, very happy with her service. She was kind and attentive to every guest in the building."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, fries and shakes!  Unique but good blend of flavors.  Friendly service to top it off!  Love supporting local places like this."}
{"text":"I suppose if you want disgusting food and poor service, Aioli Gourmet Burgers is the place for you. One thing that I absolutely despise is underdone hamburgers, so last weekend I ordered a well-done Aioli Burger with loaded fries. When the burger was served, it was barely warm, cold and pink, and the \"loaded fries\" were nothing more than cold, soggy fries covered with Velveeta-type liquid cheese and two tiny bits of avocado. When I complained to the server, she said she'd get me another hamburger. After 15 minutes of waiting I just left. I guess they just couldn't be bothered with serving their customers decent, hot food. What a waste of time and money.

I wouldn't waste my time with this place unless you like raw hamburgers with cold soggy fries covered with goopy Cheez Whiz type stuff. Heck, maybe you even like horrible service in which the server says she'll help you then disappears. However, maybe there are some people out there who actually like food and service like that."}
{"text":"Very good burger, I ordered the Italiano burger and it was excellent! Although it's pretty much self serve the servers did check on us a number of times. The water cups should be quite a bit larger, so just be aware if you are drinking water you'll be making several trips to the fountain drink machine. All of n all it was a pleasant example experience and we will be returning. 

Make sure you check your to go order before you leave. Our order has been incorrect more than once!"}
{"text":"These guys are fairly new to our area and we've been dying to try it out. 

SO GOOD!

My wife had the Aioli Burger and I had the White Truffle Burger. We both had sweet potato fries with chipotle aioli. For dessert, we had a Malted and a Strawberry shake. 

We did takeout but the dining area is clean and bright. We only live a mile away so it made sense to eat at home :-) We got our burgers fresh off the grill and they were plenty hot when I got home. 

Don't let the construction turn you off, they're open for business! And if you're feeling guilty* after your meal, stop in at YouFit gym next door!

Good job! I hope people check it out so that we can count on a close, GOOD, burger joint for years to come!

*they do lettuce wrap and gluten free options ;-)"}
{"text":"I love this place. They offer a good gluten free bun and 10% discount to students and faculty, with ID."}
{"text":"Service was great and enthusiastic. The burger are great especially the California with avocado and egg.  The different aioli for the fries are really good.  The fried mac and cheese was pretty good.  The cannoli shake was the bomb.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I liked the buger a lot, Super flavorful, hot and juicy. Could have been a little heartier for the price but was very good. Here's my question...why serve a great burger with crappy fries? They were bland shoestrings. They need to get as creative on the fries as they do with their burgers."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give this place 5+ stars!! This place not only has the most delicious burgers, but also the most insanely wonderful sweet owner! I'm a huge supporter of small businesses and not only has she won me over for her service alone, but the \"Fresh Prince\" was by far the BEST burger I've ever had!!!! I really hope it becomes a permant fixture on the menu! I pray they open a shop in Mesa soon haha until then its completely worth the 30 minute drive!"}
{"text":"Best burgers, I went in and had the Fresh Prince and omg I am in love with this place. Every one should try this place the staff are super friendly and the food is outstanding. Price is about the same for most places but the food is out of this world good."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had! I had the Aioli Burger with fries.  They were perfect! The chairs are hard but that's the only thing bad I can say about it.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Rather randomly found this place while attending a weekend event at the local high school - Shadow Mountain. 

Very good burger, tasty fries, and vanilla milkshake.  Did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Aioli Burger. Great atmosphere, great food. I highly recommend the Italiano Or Califorina Burger. It's truly worth the wait! It's busy and that's an awesome thing.... means GREAT FOOD!!"}
{"text":"Hi Tom, 

I am happy to upgrade it to a three star rating; however my written review still stands. My private message to you where I accidentally referenced a review to another restaurant did not show up in your review and does not affect your rating or my opinion.  Regarding our experience, perhaps we were just there on a day when you were understaffed I have no idea. 

Best wishes!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and really like the burgers.  They are juicy & delicious with an impressive variety of toppings.  Burger, fries, & a drink will run you about $15 and, man, you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. Upon our first visit, we were greeted by a really nice girl working. She let us take our time figuring out what we wanted and answered any questions we had. They have burgers, fries, shakes and some other options. 

I went with one of their special burgers, The Dad Burger, instead of playing it safe. The Dad came with pepper jack cheese, bacon, sriracha honey peanut butter, apricot preserves, and arugula. I wasn't quite sure how I was going to like the flavor... but it was amazing! I was so glad I ordered it. A little sweet, a little spicy, it was honestly the perfect mix. Hopefully I'll be able to grab this again before it's off the menu. 

I also ordered the sweet potato fries with a side of garlic aioli. They were pretty dang good!

My girlfriend got a plain cheeseburger and regular fries. She thought it was pretty solid. We also got the Cookie Monster Shake. It was tasty but we couldn't finish it. We were stuffed by the end of the meal. If you factor in a burger, fries and a drink you're looking at around $15 or so per person depending on what you order, but I think it's worth it here. 

The only downside to our visit was the fact that it was pretty hot inside. I know it's summer and AC bills are the worst..but it was to the point of being a little uncomfortable. Maybe some shades on the windows out front would help keep some of the heat out? Or maybe there was just air circulation issues.  Either way, that was my only semi negative comment. 

Overall, definitely check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Comfortable, casual place in a strip mall.  Service was friendly.  You order at the counter and they bring you your food.  Not a long wait.  Very creative burgers.  I tried the Italiano.  Loved it, but they overcooked the heck out of the meat.  They ask you if you want pink or not (yes, please) but apparently they got it wrong or don't care what you say.  The mac and cheese balls were nicely cooked and creamy on the inside.  Coating seemed to have a little spice on it.  Two dipping sauces.  The double chocolate malt shake was excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and really good service.  The lady runs the cash register is very friendly and always provides excellent service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my burger was absolutely delicious. I got the white truffle mushroom Swiss burger. It was full of caramelized onions and the mushrooms were cooked so perfect. Where things went wrong is when the appetizer came out. We ordered the aioli's fry flight. There were also fries on the sides option but there were two of us that were to be sharing and usually appetizers are meant for sharing. The fry flight is made up of golden crunchy fries that come with a flight of 5 flavored aioli's to dip in. I don't know why but all but one of the aioli's could be distinguished from one another. I believe the white truffle garlic aioli was the only one that didn't taste like just a plain mayonnaise. The main problem I had with the fries was that it was a ridiculously small portion of fries. The portion would have made sense if it was on the sides menu but it is on the appetizer menu. There were not even enough fries to come close to consuming the amount of aioli they give you. All in all I will not stop coming here as they do make an epic burger but I will not be ordering from the fry menu unless they stop skimping out on the proportions."}
{"text":"$34 for burgers, fries, drinks for two? Small burgers at that. The gourmet element is lost on me as I really didn't taste the difference or find the value. I can get the same quality and amount of food at Burger King for $12."}
{"text":"We hired the food truck for my Dads birthday party and it was a huge hit. Since then we have spent Mother's Day and Father's Day at the restaurant (Free burgers for Mom and Dad). You can BYOB and pay a small fee per drinker. The food is fresh, creative and flavorful (GET THE LOADED FRIES!). A great neighborhood burger joint with awesome food and ahhhmazing service."}
{"text":"Updated to reflect they reached out and deleted my email from their spam.  I would have given 4 stars because the food and the service was very, very good.  I lowered two stars because they started sending me spam emails just because I used a credit card to pay."}
{"text":"Had my first experience with the food from aioli Burger tonight.  We ordered a little bit of everything and all of it was phenomenal! We got mac n cheese bites and pretzel bites...yum!! Also the burgers and wedge salad were great!  I'm ridiculously full now and so are my parents.  Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Ok, being an Arizona native I went there in the beginning and really thought ya it's ok. Not anything great. Gave it a second then third try. The green chili burger is the bomb. Excellent heat as it should be. I'm not a huge fan of the aioli sauce the have so I get it on the side for my fries. Oh ya, fries are awesome as well awesome"}
{"text":"This place is good !!!! I love the combo deal for $11 gets you a drink a burger and your choice of grilled veggies or fries and omg the grilled veggies are prob one of the best I've ever had !!!! I love how they make eating healthy an option and not penalizing you price wise. The service was fantastic and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So here's my story. I've lived in the area for many years and for many years, our area has been greatly under served so I was happy to see a local burger joint pop up and give some variance to our few local offerings. I want to support small business especially in our community, perhaps that's why I gave an extra star for this visit.

We went on a weekday, close to their rather early close time of 8:00 pm, we got there at 7:30. There were 3 other tables and we had friends who met us shortly after. My wife and I ordered a couple burgers, sweet potato fries and drinks, about $25 said and done. Not cheap but not expensive. We were asked of the burgers, pink or no pink. Then we sat and waited for our food to arrive. 

I did notice some dirty tables but being the end of the night and after \"dinner rush\", it wasn't a huge deal, however Im a restaurant industry guy and in my world that would have been unacceptable but didn't affect my experience as much as made them look less than clean. Our friends arrived shortly after and ordered the same as we had.

The time is now around 7:40 and the front counter lady begins stacking and moving chairs across the floor, basically closing shop around us. As mentioned, I'm a restaurant guy, was for years in operations. There's few things that bothered me more than the feeling of rushing guests out. By no means did anyone there ask us to wrap it up but stacking furniture around your still dining tables doesn't send a polite message. I realize the desire to get home and keep labor costs down but shouldn't be at the expense of your guests experience.

When I saw them doing this, after shuddering, I said to our friends, just watch, people are still going to come in and they'll turn them away. And guess what happened, 2 more couples came in and both groups were told, sorry, our kitchen is closed. Now, this is a neighborhood restaurant, meaning, virtually every person coming in is a potential long term customer. Also, the people in this neighborhood are most likely the only customers you (Aioli's) will have, our little community are your guests, for the most part, your only guests. So a couple things here, closing at 8:00 is a bit early, if it must be 8:00, then close at 8:00 and not 15 minutes early. Don't rush out your guests while they eat or send a message as such by making noise and stacking, cleaning around them and for the love of God, don't turn people away who are attempting to give you their business! None of them will come back and give you another chance. You absolutely blew your chance of making those people your customers and they'll tell everyone about what happened. In my day, management would be fired for doing what I saw done, and happily. That's not guest service, that's being self serving. 

Final operational failures were we, all 4 of us were all asked of our burgers, pink or no pink. We all ordered pink, NONE received pink. My wife and I both ordered sweet potato fries. When the guy brought out our food, he had both my and my wife's basket, I could see his eyes glancing back and forth between our baskets, he stopped walking for a second as though pondering something then continued and dropped off our food and walked away without a word.. I saw what I think he was looking at, my wife's sweet potato fries were a pretty golden orange color, mine were more black than orange, burned. I didn't send them back but come on. He definitely saw them and sent them out anyway, No one checked on our table until we were near ready to pay. It wasn't a big deal enough for me to stop their closing procedures to remake my fries but it was an obvious reflection of their priorities. 

To sum it up, we split 2 burgers, one was good, the other was so-so at best. My wife's fries were good, mine terrible. The service was, seemingly, over being there that night, that was the impression I can guarantee a dozen different patrons received. I know opening a restaurant is tough especially with certain days and hours being slower than others. However, this is the business and location you chose. If you plan on gaining our communities support, then I suggest each day you and your stafff are reminded of what you are there to do and who to do it for. One of the mantras of the very successful restaurant group I worked for, for over a decade was, \"we are only as good as our last meal\". It's a good way of keeping your priorities in check and assuring you don't drop the ball. May I suggest you adopt the same mantra, you are only as good as your last meal! It wasn't good. Best of luck Aiolis."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. I got the Italiano Burger which was absolutely incredible (definitely recommend). My fiancé got the Aioli burger which was also very good and tasted a bit similar to an \"in and out\" burger. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, great fries ( I liked the sweet potato fries better). Friendly staff. Strawberry Lemonade was awesome! And they supply really good toothpicks (this is important)!"}
{"text":"We went to Aioli Burger after reading the write-up about it in the papers. It seemed like an interesting story: lifelong friends deciding to open up a burger joint in the neighborhood they grew up in. We drove out of our way to see if it would live up to the hype. It absolutely did.

I ordered the White Truffle Swiss Burger, and my wife had the Aioli Burger, along with French fries. The burgers were excellent. They were served piping hot and fresh, and the fries were crispy and tasty. The service was fast and accurate; our food was delivered quickly and with a smile. The restaurant was clean and bright. We both love a good burger, and this place just shot up to the top of our go-to list."}
{"text":"Great burgers and I looove the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night and I was very disappointed. The hamburger meat tasted awful. It tasted so old I couldn't even finish eating it! That's never happened to me before! I can usually just finish eating something even if it's not my favorite but I couldn't even finish eating it it was so disgusting. Overall it was a complete waste of my money and I wish I could have my 25 bucks back."}
{"text":"I'm from cali and this place is GREAT WISH THEY HAD ONE IN SO CAL but will definitely have to come back. Great burgers shakes and well cooked fries as well."}
{"text":"I have had their burgers a few times from the food truck. They are always very juicy and tasty and seasoned correctly. Also enjoy their fries. The owners are cool down-to-earth guys that want to serve you the freshest best burger you can get. They have a few specialty burgers that really stand out. Definitely worth checking them out."}
{"text":"I was in this restaurant Wednesday May 3. The wait time was ridiculous. I come her regularly. The veggies had tons of grease sitting in to go container. Plus waiting 45 min made me extremely irritated. Once I left I called to voice my concern. I spoke with Tanya who was extremely apologetic. She explained Aioli takes pride in what they do and my happiness is important. I'm not even sure what her title is but she was phenomenal. I will be back and Tanya thank you for offering me the gift card. The owner of this company scored big with you. See you next Wednesday."}
{"text":"Vegan option available! They have the Beyond Burger - you can get it on a gluten free bun or lettuce! Yum! Don't let the Aioli name fool you."}
