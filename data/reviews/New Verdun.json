{"text":"Ok. I don't even know how this restaurant got classified in \"chinese\". This being said,  the only disappointing experience I had with them  was teir scallops.  If you're gonna bread them and  fry them like chicken, I think it should be advertised on the menu.  As well as the canned macédoine  coming with it as the \"veggies \". Other than that the service was almost always courteous and delivery quick.  I really was disappointed with the scallops."}
{"text":"Everything that we have tried has been delicious.   The Chinese is outstanding and the pizza is the best!!!!  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants due to the friendliness of the staff and food that's always left me satisfied, as well as the proximity to where I live. They have the cheesiest alfredo I've ever eaten, very decent fries, and their chicken burger is my favourite. All in all quality food, though I'm not a fan of their Chinese.  I take friends to this place all the time :)"}
{"text":"worst ever food i have ever eaten there was a dead fly in my pasta and the service was the slowest and rudest i ever had"}
{"text":"Down the street so always one out of 5 main restaurant I'll end up choosing from.  Gyros are the best thing on the menu, with the plate you get rice fries and salad with feta, you can switch from fries to Greek potato get a lemon sauce on the side super good.   Chicken Cesar salad was a no no just lacking, poutine is a no go.  I like that's it's close, it's expensive fast food but at least they nail the Greek part on the menu."}
{"text":"Déjeuners copieux en bas de 10$, super bons et service rapide tout en étant courtois et amical. Petite découverte agréable et inattendue. J'y retournerais bien pour un autre déjeuner sans hésiter. Ps. Leurs crêpes sont vraiment bonnes même natures!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night meal after a movie. I got a an all dressed sub which was actually really good, Also shared a cesar salad, but it was nothing out of this world. The waitress was not the most polite. We asked her for water and she started cleaning and putting glasses away and chatting with another man who wasn't even eating or anything. We had to waive her down numerous times."}
{"text":"I had the #3 Chinese dinner. It was alright but they did not put enough broccoli in the almond chicken. I also got a grilled chicken Ceasar salad and they did not put the dressing on the side which caused the salad to be all soggy by the time it was delivered. It didn't help that the drenched it in dressing...like way too much. All in all I would give this a 3.5. I also think that there is no difference in the Chinese combo's when u add a person aside from the fact that they add 3 more egg rolls to it (for double the price) I may be mistaken though Final words the food was good but the small mistakes made it less enjoyable, could've been a 4."}
{"text":"Diner with the regular pizza and subs. They also have a Chinese menu and I mean old school Canadian Chinese food. It's no better than OK."}
