{"text":"Seems like the menu has been overhauled since I last dined here a couple of years ago. But NBD. We skipped the appetizers, knowing that our entrees would be plenty filling. The tasty appetizer selection is worth considering, though, if you're at Flo's with a fairly big party. We liked all of our dishes -- the spicy bean curd, the shrimp and pan-fried noodles and the chicken vindaloo, with the latter being maybe the weakest of the bunch. With it being early and uncrowded on a hot and humid evening, the wait staff was friendly and very attentive. Try out this location before the snowbirds return."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great flavor in all the dishes I've tried, my all time fave is the Chinese Lettuce Wraps! Lunch is definitely the best time to go, excellent portions and affordable prices. I plan on working my way down the entire lunch menu! Walking in, the lighting is beautiful and natural because of the big windows, it's super open space, high ceilings, cute decor, this place is modern and lovely. All the servers have been genuine and kind also!   Highly recommend for a quick bite, or even a nice family friends dinner :)"}
{"text":"The happy hour menu is a real bargain. I went alone tonight. I was seated right by the kitchen even though there were other small tables in better locations. I know I could (should) have asked to be moved but I figured maybe there would be a crowd later on and when I'm alone I don't get very picky. I was apparently assigned to a busy waiter who was annoyed at having to serve me. He took my order after about ten minutes making it clear that he was in a rush.   I didn't see him again except once when he refilled my soft drink. Others bring the items when they're ready. They brought out two of the three appetizers I had ordered in reasonable time. I knew the third one - the chicken wings - take 20 minutes to prepare so I waited. And waited. Didn't see my waiter. After 40 minutes the bus boy asked me if I wanted any boxes for my leftovers. I told him I still didn't have all my order. He went to check it out. Only then did my waiter come (actually about another five minutes later) to tell me it would be just a few more minutes. I told him to just forget them and bring me the check.   He seemed reluctant to do that maybe because it would reflect on his service. But he did. So, I got a pretty good albeit a pretty small meal for about ten bucks. Because I feel sorry for people who have to make a living as servers I still have him a five dollar tip.   The other problem with Flo's is that, other than a few appetizers, the rest of their dishes aren't even mediocre.   The two appetizers you should try are the shiu Mai and the chicken wings. The calamari is tasty but often too chewy."}
{"text":"One of the best chinese spots I've been to anywhere. The prices can be a little high for takeout chinese but other than that the food is absolutely delicious.  I recommend it all the time to friends."}
{"text":"We arrived shortly after 3:30, got sat on a tiny table and were ignored for almost 20 minutes. Plenty of staff running around, it must have been shift change as nobody wanted to serve us. The noise level was terrible, like sitting in an echo chamber. We left and had a great meal at Tokyo Joes across the street."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area so we went to Flo's for the first time. The reviews were spot on. Great food, service, and atmosphere. I love that there is a lot of tables, but the way they have them arranged I didn't feel like I was sitting right on top of someone else. Mitch our server was great. Very attentive, but not annoying. The only complaints I have is no WiFi, and the yoga pants the hostess was wearing. Not appropriate for such a classy place. Other than that we had a great time, and a great meal."}
{"text":"Did carryout and the food was great...glad to see in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Food is alright. Ambiance is boring. Service is always great though! Good happy hour menu. I do like that they have a bar area with a couple of tv's. I just wish they had better food options (like sushi) and a better ambiance."}
{"text":"Love this place. Favorite menu item : unbreaded orange chicken! It's amazing! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Soooo tasty! And the service is great, even when the restaurant is super busy. I love the salad before you get your order too (always free, and always included) - there's nothing better than sitting down to instant food rather than having to wait for your order of appetizers to arrive."}
{"text":"Eh...so so.  Service was speedy but...they are running so fast they're doing sort of drive by service so you can't get their attention if you need something, and there were a number of things I would have asked for. Won ton soup made with water not broth.  Won tons weren't wrapped properly so they fell apart and veggies were far too crispy in the soup.  They didn't serve it in a proper little bowl with a Chinese soup spoon.  It was a regular old American soup spoon.  Not fun.  They wrapped the moo shu pork for you, and then gave you sauce to dip it in which takes all the fun out of wrapping it yourself.  The plum sauce was so salty it was not enjoyable.  I needed a gallon of water to drink after a few bites of that, but I couldn't get a server to stop running past my table.  No tea offered to start???    I saw a couple drinking tea out of coffee mugs.  That is just WRONG! at a Chinese restaurant.  I don't recommend Flo's."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars if it were an option, because the food is good but they fall behind in other areas. For starters, their prices are a little too high compared to other similar restaurants. Second, although their food is very good, it is inconsistent. I haven't really had issues with their service, although we usually get take-out with them. I definitely suggest they lower their prices a bit, but overall a good place to get lunch."}
{"text":"So I have decided to make a yelp account after my most recent unfortunate experience at flos. My family loves the food so it Is a popular choice when deciding on dinner! So we decided to go just the other night everything was great until the middle aged busser starts dropping f-bombs loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear... followed by him rambling on in Spanish.... Definitely not a child friendly place anymore... Yikes!!"}
{"text":"I have been  coming here regularly for many years and this is one of my favorite restaurants and definitely my favorite Asian restaurant. I rarely stray from the cashew chicken because I love it so much but have had many other dishes that are also very good. The appetizers including lettuce wraps and spring rolls are great. The chocolate won tons for desert are great. I love the atmosphere. The service is usually excellent."}
{"text":"Recipes are generally good and meats usually tender but the best bet is to dine in rather than take-out as over the past six months preparation consistency has slipped and errors on the order are fairly frequent (1 out of 3).  When last I called to report something left out of the take-out order, I received a rude response. I'll avoid the Thompson Peak location and try their Promenade location."}
{"text":"Manager has a lack of knowledge on their food items. I ordered a dish that I've ordered before in the past. This time I told them to go easy on the sauce. Apparently that means serve it plain, no sauce. She told me the dish doesn't have a lot of sauce. When I ordered it the past 3 times, it is drenched in sauce. The dish is good but just needs a little less sauce. I also ordered a gluten free item for my 2 year old like I have been for the past 10 visits. This time I got different noodles. I asked the manager if it was gluten free and she had no idea. She didn't even know they had 2 different type of rice noodles. If a restaurant has specifically noted some items as gluten free, as a manager she should have some knowledge of those items. There was no apology, they offered me a credit. I told them I will only use it at their other location where service is great and I can depend on my food being prepared correctly."}
{"text":"Great place! Happy hour is awesome! It is pretty busy, but we never had to wait for our food or drinks. Great place to bring the little ones as well. They're very accepting of loud noise and some messes:)"}
{"text":"Flo's has a great happy hour - $2 beer, half price cocktails and wine, and half price appies which are large and really tasty! The lettuce wraps are substantial and great for sharing. I wasn't a fan of the dumplings, but the chicken satay was great. Some nice noodle dishes on the main menu. Incredibly affordable for what you get. Staff were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Service was not good, young teenagers running the place.  Food was ok but there are way better choices than Flos."}
{"text":"Love the Happy Hour! All staff so pleasant and helpful! Flo is a wonderful hostess. Thank you for birthday drinks! :)"}
{"text":"Disappointing dinner ~  I can't understand why there was such a long wait to get into this place.  My friend and I likely would have had a better meal over at AJ's.  The acoustics are horrendous - I had to scream at my friend the entire evening.  When we were finally seated, before we could even hang our purses on the back of our chairs, a server was there asking for our order.  Apparently, we were supposed to study the menu during our 40 minute wait.  Clearly wanting to get us in and out, our food arrived a little too quickly.  I had the Curry Vegetables - horrible - some of the veges were way under ripe (broccoli was more white than green) and undercooked (yes, I know they should be crunchy).  The sauce was bland.  Even the rice wasn't good - how does an Asian place screw up rice?  There were no seasonings/condiments on the table other than the obligatory Kikkoman's.  We were ignored until it was check time.  I know it was a busy Friday evening, but that doesn't mean service and food quality should go by the wayside.  Kudos to the owner for actually being there, although it's not really a shock she would like to show her face considering there's two large pictures of her right when you walk in the door."}
{"text":"Major issue with child safety and service. They provided us with two high chairs with broken safety belts. Upon request for replacement, they said that all their chairs have the same problem! Very strange that at some point when they were probably left with a couple good chairs, no one in the management every thought of replacing or fixing the broken chairs. Made the experience so bad since the kids wouldn't stay in the chair and could possible hurt themselves. We left without eating and had to take to-go. No courtesy shown by the manager at the store, except for a couple apologies. Paid a premium on the food to eat at the restaurant with expectations of good CS and ended up eating it at home. Could have just gotten food from a drive through instead.   Only plus was that the food had decent flavor, but have eaten better for the price. Bad management decisions make for bad customer experiences. Hope the restaurant owner understands this. Not going there with kids again for sure. Back to PF Changs!"}
{"text":"I love almost all dishes at Flos.  When I crave for Chinese food, I always go to Flos."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. The food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. My favorite dish is the cinnamon shrimp!"}
{"text":"Really good food! The calamari was outstanding (it's white meat only served in fillets, not rings...seasoned perfectly). Their happy hour is the best time to go...cheap appetizers that are delicious. Drinks were strong. The service was a little slow. But the food is just amazing. I've been three times now, ordered something different each time, and loved it!"}
{"text":"I ate there on a friend's recommendation; I won't be asking for any for anymore recommendations.  The two dishes I tried were both overly salty, I'm guessing to mask the flavor.  The quality of food just wasn't that good.  If you looking for food of this nature (un-authentic Chinese), give Pei-Wei or PF Changs a try instead.  They're much, much better."}
{"text":"My fave of all of the Flos restaurants. Best lunch deal in town and so yummy!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love the food at Flo's. I don't think I have ever been disappointed in anything I have ever eaten there. The curries are a standout for me; particularly the Malaysia Cashew Beef and the Green Chicken Curry. Yum. Well, the hubby hated the atmosphere...too noisy due to concrete and scraping of chairs on said concrete...so if we want Flo's for dinner it is carryout only. One of my gal pals is always up for going out to lunch and loves the food at Flo's, too. We go there fairly frequently. Or should I say, we used to go there fairly frequently. Monday was the last straw. We sit down, with menus to the side and start yakking. A minute or two goes by and before our server has even come by, the food runner plunks down our salads and fried won tons. Now mind you, we have not ordered food yet, let alone DRINKS. Are you kidding me? Who serves the salad course before drinks are even ordered? Tacky. Super tacky. We looked at each other incredulously. Now here comes our \"charming\" server. Who waited on me last time I was there, by the way,  and was every bit as \"charming\". She opens with: \"Are you ready to order\" no \"Hello\", no \"May I get you something to drink\"...girlfriend is cutting right to the chase. I look up and simply say I would like an iced tea. Gal pal Sue replies, \"Yes the same for me\". Then Ms Personality asks if we are ready to order. I say \"No\" as coldly as she asks us. Yuk. What a buzz kill. Okay. Things went fairly fine after that. She came by two more times (with a little less 'tude) and on the third we did order. Of course it came out with lightening speed, and of course it was delicious. It is also such a good deal for lunch with most entrees served with salad coming in at around 7-8 bucks a pop. So, I have a couple of questions: Is the management so bad that they make everybody miserable who work there? And why the rush rush rush? It is a large restaurant, we were there at the tail end of lunch, and clearly not in a hurry. The joint was half empty. I have waited tables and I know that working the lunch shift kind of sucks because you don't turn your tables. But I tip accordingly if I overstay my welcome. Good look doing that at Flo's. We were still in and out of there in less than an hour even with our delay tactics."}
{"text":"Food is generally pretty good but the snotty little brat that answers the phone to take our pick-up order couldn't be more rude and almost ruined our appetite once again. It's a shame how one person can negatively affect a dining experience. The owners should hire someone new before losing more business."}
{"text":"I rated this restaurant so low because we had to wait over an hour for our food, food wasn't bad but the service so bad, not sure I will be going there again."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious and service was excellent. We were a party of ten people and everyone commented on the extensive menu and how pleased they were with the food and drinks. We'll be coming back often. Flo's is very busy around the six o'clock hour, recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"Service is awesome, we loved our server. Gotta say that right away. Food, usually good. Tonight we started with the coconut curry soup which is usually delicious. We get it every time we come in. Tonight it was Very weirdly bland. We mentioned it and sent it back, very nicely. She came back and asked us what was specifically wrong with it (after we'd already specifically told her)  I'm pretty sure the folks in the kitchen made her do that. So, waited forever for it to come back out. It was handed to us by a young man who made a point of saying \"coconut curry soup, extra spicy\" just to let us know what assholes we are. Anyway, they had remade it and thrown in a handful of jalapenos (not an ingredient of this soup)  we like the server so we said nothing but you know what?  Totally classless and rude."}
{"text":"Meh, not super impressed with this place.  Had the Kung Pao chicken.  Was just OK.  Wasn't spicy at ALL and I wanted at least a little kick!  Chicken was a weird texture.  I wasn't a fan.    I also ordered the Thai Coconut soup and that was OK.... again, not the spice I wanted.  Portions are really decent size though, and service was good.    Probably won't go back cause I just wasn't terribly impressed...."}
{"text":"One of the cool perks of being a teacher is that I have really awesome, nice parents who take pity on me because I am pretty much stranded at school with my 35 minute lunch hour, and treat me to fabulous lunches on occasion. Because Flo's is close by I often have parents who treat me to Flo's. They have a really great lunch portion menu and their lunches come with a side salad and the crispy wonton chips. My (new) favorite dish is the Pine Nut Shrimp-absolutely delicious-one of my student's parents brought me this dish last week to celebrate the end of AIMS testing. I don't even mind that  the mere thought of salt makes me blow up like a puffer fish (let's face it-you can't really get away from sodium when it comes to Chinese food). The pine-nut shrimp and Flo's food in general is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Were it possible to give 1/2 star I would! We use to eat at this location frequently up until about 2010. My daughter & I thought we'd go back today. First thing I noticed was menu... limited, but thought we'd try our all time favorite chicken & basil & house fried rice. I decided to try the spicy coconut soup.... wish I hadn't. Not only was the food bland, boring, but I couldn't even eat the soup. It made me sick to my stomach for the rest of the day. Service was horrible & had to wave down \"manager\" to get the check. One positive was the salad as the dressing was good.  We will not be going back! No one bothered to ask why we left a table full of food & didnt want to take it home."}
{"text":"Yum! A little noisy but I didn't mind. They did forget the tofu on our rice and only brought out one of the two orders of spring roles we ordered.. They were quick to fix their mistake though. It was very good food with very good service!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place! Ordered take out a few days ago and was so disappointed. Nothing was great. One of the dishes we ordered had no sauce in it. Pretty much dried noodles and vegetables. To top off the horrible food, it was definitely way too overpriced. 3 meals and a couple appetizers for almost $80. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Best hot and sour soup we've ever had!  It's $5 and easily serves 2 big eaters.  We were there for lunch. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Ever since I've been in Phx, I've been looking for good chinese food... Flos is ok, but that's about it. There wasn't anything about the food that wowed me or makes me want to drive up to North Scottsdale again. I will say that the wonton chips are yummy, but that's not enough to keep me going back."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there today . Food is always good. Great hot n sour soup"}
{"text":"Last night was my first dining experience at Flo's. The ambience was nice, and our server Emmi, did a great job explaining the menu as well as providing us with great service. We ordered honey beef, Sichuan orange chicken, chicken fried rice and chicken lo mein, and we're pleasantly dazzled with each one.  We'll definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Have to knock Flo's down a few notches.  Flo's used to be my go to for take out.   They had really good food for the prices and they had a great kids menu that my boys loved.   I was put off when I called in for take out and was told that prices had gone up, because of new ingredients, and kids items were no longer available for takeout.   They were more than happy to make a kids dish in a regular size and price.    So my normal $35 order went to $60.  The funny thing was that my Pine Nut Shrimp did not taste any better at the higher price and with the new ingredients.  Kids also thought the food was worse without the kids plate.  I know Flo's was always booming, but I am not sure the snowbirds are going to like it when they come back to find they are paying gourmet prices.  I wish Flo's luck, but I have too many other choices at this price point."}
{"text":"What makes Flo's worth the trip is the Happy hour.  You can fill up on appetizer goodies and have a beer or two for a reasonable amount.  The food is average and some of the appetizers are mislabeled if you have Chinese family and are accustomed to the food.  This is not really suprising or even important for a restaurant in the states since not many people would notice and if it's good then so what?  It does make it trickier if there are expectations to be met.  Flo's is by no means authentic but some of the dishes are good for what they are and the ambiance is nice when it's not too loud."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am in the food and beverage industry myself, so I am extremely patient and understanding when it comes to dealing with a busy/ bad server.   However, I only stopped by flo's to order some take-out on a rainy night. When I arrrived, the place was packed and so loud that I coudn't not hear anyone talking to me! I walked up to the bar and waited for about 10 mins (like I said, I get it, there are busy! I can wait my turn) Then the bartneder finally turned to me and asked what i wanted. I said a to-go order and she told me that I would have to go to the hostess station....would have been nice to know 15 mins ago. So after wating in line again, i placed my order, veggie spring rolls and lettcue wraps. They told me it would be ready in 15 mins. I waited in starbucks right next door.   After about 20 mins, I went back to check on my food. I asked a girl up front if it was ready, she said \"she didnt do to-go orders\" ok??? so i asked another girl up front and she said it wasnt ready yet. After another 15 min wait, I finally asked again if it was ready and they girl turned around and grabbed a bag off the counter and said here it is! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!! IT WAS THERE THE ENTIRE TIME!  I told her my food was now cold and soggy.... but she conviently didn't hear me say it.   I threw it away in the garbage can outside... There goes 15 dollars down the drain.  No wonder the hostess insisted that I paid prior to recieving my food. I'm sure too many unhappy customers would walk out without taking their food home. I would have!!!  I will never go back to Flo's and do not suggust anyone else goes their either. The service is horrible and the food is not worth the $. No wonder they have to give away 5$ lunches. Even if I had complained, I'm not sure anyone would have cared.   Trust me, save your $. You're better off going to Panda Express."}
{"text":"While I don't know if everything here is worthy of 5 stars, the Cashew Chicken that I ordered on Mother's Day was delicious and I would have given it 5 stars by itself! I had plenty leftover for lunch the following afternoon and it was just as good then. While I didn't enjoy the dish that my sister ordered as much (some kind of fried beef covered in sauce), it's one of her favorite dishes here. We had really good service despite it being a busy holiday and got free wontons in chocolate sauce at the end of our meal. The only negative aspect was that we were apparently seated right under an air conditioning vent because it was FREEZING! I overheard the table that was later seated beside us complain to the server that it was too cold, but there wasn't really anything they could or would do about it. All in all, it was one of the better Chinese/Asian restaurants I've tried since moving to Arizona."}
{"text":"Food is still good.  Take out simple order.  Irene gets indignant about my tip.  I get that she is flo top employee  but there is no reason to be indignant toward a customer.  I will limit my visits or take ours from flos accordingly. ... Bad service gets bad results. The food is what earns my review.   Anywhere but vina this is the best chinese food I can get..."}
{"text":"Not only is this the best Flo's location, it's the best Chinese restaurant I've found in the city. In fact, it's the best Chinese restaurant I've found outside of San Francisco. The BEST hot and sour soup - the perfect balance of the spicy and sour elements. Everything is extremely fresh and they use high quality ingredients. The service is prompt and friendly, too, so Flo's is a great overall experience."}
{"text":"After a lukewarm initial view of this mini-chain, I've become a believer.  The lunch menu and value can't be beat and the addition  of the happy hour (3-7/7 days a week; 1/2 of alcohol & apps) enters this place into the apres work happy hour rotation. Staff always meets expectations and the food quality is consistent.    The only possible knock (and this is REALLY nit-picking) is that the food is consistent in it's simplicity as well as quality.  Sometimes I wish they'd roll the dice and innovate the menu a little and introduce a few specials (I don't believe they offer any off the menu fare) or seasonal dishes. Strongly suggest trying this place if you haven't, and sit at the bar if you've only experienced the dining room."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food! We've been here a couple of times, and both times the food was good. They give you wontons and a salad right after you order, and the food we had as leftovers heated up very nicely! It tasted almost as good as the food did when it first came out.  Great lunch prices!"}
{"text":"You cant beat the price of their food. Good portions and hot/sour soup is always nice on a cold and gloomy day...  My favorite is the Spicy Ginger Onion Beef..."}
{"text":"One of the more pleasant happy hour experiences in both food and drinks thus far. Pleased with the service, great atmosphere, and the Sweet and Sour Soup is amazing, any time of year!"}
{"text":"My family and I are somewhat \"newbies\" at Flo's and we love the happy hour. The food is great and service is fantastic. Last Friday we had Katie, she is very knowledgeable and attentive. She seemed as if she has worked there forever! We asked her how long she has worked there, and told us 10 years. She is very genuine which is hard to find in people these days. We told her to not stop smiling because her smile is contagious. Katie's recommendations were spot on! I can see Flo's being a weekly dinner night for our family! Btw Hot and Spicy soup is to die for!"}
{"text":"omg...hands down the worst chinese food I've ever had anywhere.  Stopped by for lunch with my wife.  I ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp.  Barely edible.  Makes Panda Express look like gourmet chinese food.  Prior to Flo's, the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in Nebraska...but that's Nebraska.  I'm chinese and live in San Francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Flo's regularly since the tempe location opened. We are big fans of the other ones in Scottsdale.  The food at this location is soooo delicious!!!!  The waiters are  friendly and the manager usually comes around to see if the customer is being taken care of.  Best appetizers and great happy hour! (strong drinks)  Con: It is a bit loud in there."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the new menu. The calamari is gone and so is Chef Danny's lemon pepper chicken. Chef Danny is completely off the menu. The new 1 sheet menu must cost less to print. But prices are higher to compensate!"}
{"text":"We moved here from Hong Kong a few years ago and were introduced to Flo's by our long time resident friends.  Mind you, we lived in one of the culinary capitals of the world, where the best of any food can be found.  Also, I am American and my wife is Chinese.  Flo has a fun and varied menu.  We are sure that the Western palate leans toward Orange Chicken and General Tsao's Chicken, along with Spring Rolls and Fortune Cookies.  However, the menu has a variety of well-prepared and tasty dishes with noodles and the spicier items being quite appetizing.  So, for those of you who have written less than positive reviews, you have certainly limited yourselves to a narrow sampling of Flo's.  The iconic Saturday Lunch, yes, has increased in cost and the portions may be smaller but, come on, what more could you ask for at $6? Flo has given us a unique place to savor Asian dishes at, realistically, economic costs.  We, for one (and our feelings are shared by our group of friends) enjoy a periodic Happy Hour at Flo's and stopping by for a nice lunch on a Saturday, while running errands.  Thank you, Flo....................GRW"}
{"text":"Great lettuce wraps! I get the Thai ones, although the build your own Chinese ones are good too. The pad thai here is perfect, but the cinnamon shrimp is a must-try if you like cinnamon. They're not kidding, either, it is spicy, which isn't usually what you associate with cinnamon. The chile orange chicken is really good too. I get take-out from here and it's always good, although once or twice they've forgotten an extra order of sauce I asked for. In-restaurant service is very good."}
{"text":"This place drives me crazy. Its not cheap and the kids working in there are so rude. We order for take out a lot and more Times than not the food is just thrown in there and the sauces leak everywhere.  They never give extra sauce or more than 1 fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Went here once.  Fresh summer rolls were poorly made, way too big to eat, not very good.  Egg drop soup was pretty good, but too salty.  My credit card was overcharged $3.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star because the TAKE OUT SERVICE sucks.  The last two times they have forgotten something in our order.  They tie knots in the bags when you pick it up and even when you verify the order with them verbally there is still something missing. We have had problems in the past but I never posted a review but since it was two times in a row I think it's time they get their act together.  The first time I ordered a side salad and chips to go with our entrees but they were not in the bag when I got home.  Since it was just a salad and chips I opted not to go back and pick it up.  This last time we ordered lettuce wraps but when I got home the chicken filling was not in the bag.  I called to let them know I was coming back to get it.  The first girl I talked to asked me to double check to be sure I didn't have it.  Then she put me on hold and another person came on the line and described what kind of package it would be in and asked me if I was sure it wasn't included.  REALLY?  We didn't order that much food that the container would be sitting in front of me and I didn't see it!  I told them we definitely didn't have it and I wanted to come and get it.  When I got back to the restaurant they had it ready for me but just barely apologized and didn't offer to refund my money for the inconvenience or even offer a coupon or discount on my next visit.  Since my family was at home waiting to eat and the food was getting cold I opted not to talk to the manager.  I just didn't feel like dealing with it.  So unless you insist that the bags are not tied up when you go to pick up or make them untie everything to verify beware you may be missing something in your order when you get back home.  One other thing....their interpretation of SPICY is actually MILD.  Every time I have ever ordered something that says spicy on the menu it has not been even remotely spicy.  I always have to add hot mustard or chili to it."}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup is da bomb!  Seriously the best I've ever had.  It's full of tender shrimp and chopped green onions that give it some great freshness.  The large bowl that serves 4 people is only $5.  It's so good, I could eat the whole thing myself.  We were there with 6 people and all ordered different entrees.  Garlic chicken stir fry, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Lemon Pepper Chicken, General's Chicken (not spicey enough), Kung Pao Chicken (not spicey enough either).  The Garlic chicken stir fry was the best.  If you like spice, ask them to make your entree more spicy, as everything is pretty mild.  There is also a secret menu, so if you have some Chinese favorites that aren't on the menu, ask your server.  The chicken is very high quality and I believe all white meat.  I will go back for the soup and garlic chicken stir fry, and get more recommendations from the servers.  This will definitely be my go-to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Nice menu with many choices.  I have enjoyed every item I have tried."}
{"text":"Typical fusion Asian food.  Nothing special.  Spicy foods are mild at most.  If you're tired of pei wei maybe give this place a shot?"}
{"text":"This place is a must!! Excellent happy hour prices, great portions, and nice place. The chicken lettuce cups(wraps) were $3.50 on happy hour and it was delicious!!  Happy hour is everyday from 3-7 pm."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food we have had in the USA..the quality is good, the portions great .the service good.went for dinner with apprehension but came back satisfied.the hot and sour soup had good flavours three of us shared one order.the chicken lomen ..good"}
{"text":"I don't know what I would do without Flo's... My husband and I are frequent visitors (almost weekly) simply because it's an easy walk from our home. The food is delicious, the portions are generous, and the staff is always friendly and speedy. Some of the best Asian food I've  had!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Don't bother with a menu, just get the Dan Dan Noodles and enjoy your meal, some of the best flavoring I've had! Super generous portions as well, we also had the cashew beef and the side of brown rice was the equivalent of a whole pot of rice!! I'll definitely be back when I'm in Chandler the next time!"}
{"text":"Having lived in the near Flo's for over ten years, we frequently (twice per month) have gone there or ordered via telephone since that time.  Most of the time service is good; however, I have had my trepidation since they typically hire 14-16 year old employees working at the counter.  Tonight, I ordered sizzling rice soup via phone and when I got home it was definitely not sizzling rice soup.   When I called letting them know there was a mistake, I was placed on hold and then the gal who took the order got on the line, and said, \"I repeated your order twice, and that is what you ordered.\"  I was taken aback, since that is not what I ordered and it was not repeated.  Again, since I have ordered here, so many times, I expected to politely disagree with her assessment, and then be compensated for what I ordered, however, she was really rude.  At that point, I hung up and agreed with my wife to not order from Flo's again.  I was so frustrated that they would argue over something like $2 or $3 difference in price for a long time customer.  Now,  they lost over $100 per month (small, I know), but my neighbors and customers will also learn about the rudeness and arguing that occurred. Again, I am usually very tolerate, but don't need to be treated like a moron (and basically called a liar) to pay money for food."}
{"text":"4/4/11: I've been enjoying food from Flo's since 1998. I get takeout because it is loud in restaurant. Spring rolls are my favorite appetizers - I get two orders so I can eat one on way home. I like various dishes especially when they are willing to cook off menu (like chicken with snow peas).  Subtracted one star for noisy atmosphere"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Flo's this weekend. We chose takeout and unfortunately there was a minor error on our order. That was addressed but the food was bland"}
{"text":"Dear Flo- It's not you, it's me.  I just can't justify spending $14.95 for lo mein, then being charged an additional $2.00 for extra vegetables and all you add is three pieces or broccoli.  Our last dinner came to nearly $50, to-go with only two items.   We ordered the chicken fried rice several times and the chicken was rubbery and definitely not what we've come to expect.  I'm sorry Flo, after nearly eight years I'll miss our weekly date, but the updated menu pricing and lower quality food is forcing me to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Flo's growing up in the valley. I just visited the Tempe location, visiting from New York, and picked up a to go order for me and my friends (mu shu, katsu chicken, lo mein, pad Thai, and beef noodle soup). We get home to discover there are no pancakes for our mu shu. We call to let the restaurant know only to be asked if we \"actually checked for the pancakes\"  after being put on hold. After telling the hostess answering the phone we didn't have a car to come get the pancakes (visiting/hotel = no car) she said \"there is really nothing I can do for you then.\" Disappointed in the customer service to say the least."}
{"text":"My family in Arizona recently discovered this place through word-of-mouth, and when I arrived to visit them we went here to eat lunch after they picked me up at the airport. My brother and I split a giant bowl of pho (my mother, the vegetarian, passed because it had a meat broth). The pho was wonderful and came with a plate of add-ins and sauces, plus smaller bowls for us to ladle our individual portion into.  We also ordered entrees which were good, solid versions of Asian food.  My mother, the vegetarian who also wants gluten-free food, was a little disappointed because her entree came with noodles, which she was not expecting and was unwilling to eat. That having been said, she didn't ask the server about gluten-free options before ordering, and there may have been some. If you are averse to eating gluten, you might want to ask before ordering.  Flo's wasn't crowded at 1 pm when we were there, but I'm told it does get crowded at other times.  It was a great place for me to eat and enjoy the sunshine and appreciate being on the ground again, and I hope to go back!"}
{"text":"went for dinner on 6-6-15. been eating here since she opened. ordered shrimp & long beans. shrimp was very small and overcooked. very hard. order this all the time, never so bad. also ordered shrimp & eggnoodles. same thing. shrimp was very small & overcooked. very hard. she used to use very large shrimp and were never overcooked. whats the chances both dishes had small shrimp and both overcooked? wow! lettuce cups are the best u can find. moouse is the best 2. but at $6 is a bit pricey. used 2 be $4. wonder what happened to flos? mayb gonna close when they move 2 tempe? have 2 look 4 another good chinese place."}
{"text":"Not fit for human being -- I ended up throw away all take out I've ordered.  Worst Chinese food I've ever seen. Yes I am Chinese.  Yes I've eaten both authentic as well as Americanized Chinese food; of which both can be good.   The food here is growse.... Yuk~"}
{"text":"Went to Flo's in Tempe for the first time, it was Halloween evening, so we were served by a very tall hot dog w/mustard, the service was good, thank you Andrew! We started off w/two glasses of wine and the vegetable potstickers, they were about the best I've had and the dipping sauce was delicious. I ordered the Spicy Cinnamon Shrimp, it was beyond  excellent, very rich  and completely different than any dish I have ever eaten, this alone will keep me coming back to Flo's! The fried strips of crepe were a nice added touch to the dish and yummy. i needed a box to take the leftovers home. My dinner companion had the Pine nut Shrimp and said it was a bit bland but the broccoli was cooked to perfection. The portions are nice, not overly 'loaded' w/food, the prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is comfortable and clean. Only one reason I did not give Flo's 5 stars, we were seated on the southwest side of the restaurant, the sun was going down and I had a choice of the sun in my eyes or beating down on my back, my eyes won that decision but our waiter had to wear sunglasses to serve us, there are no blinds to close. I cannot imagine the summer months with the AZ sun interfering with my dining experience, Flo, call your decorator!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to Flo's for 3 years now and I cannot imagine how anyone would write a negative review!  Those that have any negative thing to say, please stay away so that we can actually get a seat!  The food is always perfect and the prices are great! Word has gotten out about this gem and we have to make sure we get there a little earlier than usual.  We love this place and will be coming back on a regular basis.  Keep up the great work and ignore those that don't appreciate a great atmosphere and amazing food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch yesterday and the food was excellent. I know food tastes are all individual but we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. When I was about 10 years old friends of my parents (both from China) had us over for  dinner. She had made Beef with Black Bean Sauce. It was excellent and for some reason that is my constant go to meal when in Chinese restaurants. I have to say that the Beef with Black Beans at Flo's is as good as what I had as a kid. I grew up in New York and went to China Town quite frequently so I feel that I have a benchmark to compare it to. My wife usually has the Shrimp Lo Mein and that is what she had yesterday as well. Her meal was excellent. I know there have been changes with the menu and with pricing as well.  I know you no longer get the  bowl of chips and the hot dipping sauce for free but you can get a small portion of the chips and hot dipping sauce at no charge if you ask for it. I do feel that $1 is worth the price if you want a larger portion of the Chips.  Our server was Danielle. There was no need to go over the menu as we both knew what we wanted. Danielle was very attentive and  and checked on us a number of times during the meal to make sure everything was tasting good. Even though  the prices have gone up somewhat, what business hasn't raised prices, but it is well worth it. Looking forward to our next trip to the valley and our next enjoyable meal at Flo's Great meal!!"}
{"text":"Uninspired. From the food to the staff, just another mediocre Chinese restaurant in the valley. I expected something better."}
{"text":"I eat here on a regular basis. Kung Pao Chicken is the best in Scottsdale. Service is always incredible. Pot Stickers are fantastic. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super fresh Chinese food. They also did an A+ job with our call in take out order. Super cool customers and a great happy hour with a happy hour food menu"}
{"text":"Time to find a another place for Asian food. I loved the previous menu, which separated the dishes by origin, noted which items were gluten free and had reasonable prices. I feel like Flo hired a consultant who demolished all that was great and put into effect a menu that lacks many of my previous favorite items, is MUCH smaller in scope, and MUCH more expensive. This was my go-to place for dine in, take out and happy hour. No more! It's a shame because I frequented all of the locations, dating back to the short-lived place in DC Ranch. What I ordered last night for take out was just okay. Miss the old Flo's!"}
{"text":"Flo's is great! I go t this restaurant on a regular basis.   They are always quick and courteous. The food is consistently great! The prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"The place to get Chinese food in the McDowell Mountain ranch area. This place is usually pretty busy. We have been happy with every dish we have gotten there. The hot and sour soup is very good and the spring rolls are awesome."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place, and finally did this weekend.  I usually hesitate to go to \"Asian\" restaurants.  I prefer to eat at more authentic restaurants that focus on a certain food...Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, etc.. you get the picture.  I was pleasantly surprised to realize that we went here during happy hour (Sunday at 4) and got 50% off drinks and apps.  I had the green curry, which was good, gf had shrimp lo mein and others had spicy shrimp chow mein and the pepper chicken.  I think the curry was best.  Food was good, not excellent, and overall a decent experience."}
{"text":"Excellent first impression, and on takeout. She had the Fried Honey Beef and I had the Seafood Sizzling Rice Guo Ba. Normally I don't let my first visit anywhere include a seafood dish, but I sure am glad I did. The food was delicious, prepared entirely on time, and the staff was very friendly when I arrived.  We're looking forward to dining in, and expect the next review to become a 5/5 for us. Nice looking place, in and out!"}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting Flo's.  We were not impressed.  We ordered the shrimp & snap peas with sauted vegetable and were completely under whelmed.  If you can describe anything less than bland, that would be it.  On a Wednesday night, the place was packed so I was so surprised when we sat down at our table with our to go order and felt I would have better served with Panda Express, which I hate by the way.  The spring rolls that I ordered (thinkin P.F. Chang's) were worse than I could have gotten at Costco for a total of $8 for 4.  I can't recommend it and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Ended up here for Happy Hour last week and was pleasantly surprised.  The HH is a great value.  The drinks were good and we definitely ordered way too much food, expecting the food portions to be small for HH.  Do not make our mistake, order a couple to start and then order more if you need it - I doubt you will.  Wonderful addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Good dinner. Ordered two dishes for takeout which they got wrong, so frustrating to get home and not have what you ordered. Second time we have gotten wrong takeout order."}
{"text":"We ordered two teriyaki lunch specials & they were great for the price. Plus the staff was friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"Tried to have a nice dinner here on a Saturday night, 7:30-ish. Usually have a good experience here for a weekday lunch and knew my son and his fiancé would like it. However, tonight we had to walk out. No one came to take our order. Even after we politely asked the busboy to ask someone to take our order. It's not like they were busy - pretty empty actually. Just got tiered of waiting and watching the staff walk around setting tables and ignoring us. And as we left, there were two waitpersons just leaning against the wall chatting behind the hostess station. Plenty of other choices in North Scottsdale where you won't be so rudely ignored."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and modern, and you can smell all of the yummy Chinese food when you walk in. I especially love the Beef Chow Mein. The only thing I haven't liked is the Fried Rice, which just seems like white rice with veggies and meat thrown in. Great place for take-out!"}
{"text":"Definitely American-style Chinese...no shame in that though, great food here.  Entrees were on the large side though so order to share."}
{"text":"This is probably the best kinda of, fancier then normal, chain Chinese place I have been to that I can remember.  It is way better then Pei Wai and I guess better then P.F. Chang's.  Although, I can't really say that since it has been a while since i have eaten there...So, i would suggest going to Flo's your self and YOU tell me if it's better the P.F. Chang's.  Also, there lunch is WAY cheap, less then $30 for 3 people!!!  Why I didn't give it 5 Stars.  1st time I have been there.  Parking wasn't very good at all.  We had to drive around the small lot a couple times.  People were parking in the fire zone."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this meal. Having ordered the Beef & Wide Noodles, I was glad to see the healthy-sized bowl presented to me. They bury the noodles way down there, but there are plenty. The food is heavily-oiled, but not overly salted.   Fun and entertaining music played at this location. Bright atmosphere; lovin' the windows and the decor. Stylish, clean, with small tables and lots of dining space."}
{"text":"Flo's is nothing more than fast food Chinese with sit down dinning. Food is greasy and tastes of old burnt cooking oil. Sauces are all sugar based, no real flavor. Meats and vegetables are probably mass cooked, sit in bins soaking up the grease and getting stale, then tossed in the syrup when ordered.  As for the happy hour appetizers - you get what you pay for- these are nothing more than food service frozen items."}
{"text":"Service and Food is always excellent. For a sit down quick chinese restaurant you can't beat Flo's"}
{"text":"I picked up takeout on Monday and was very surprised at how delicious it was! I really didn't know of many good Chinese in the area and was recommended by a coworker. My boyfriend and I orders of the chicken lo mein and orange chicken to split. Both were very good. I was surprised yet pleased that the orange chicken came with the sauce on the side because takeout chicken with sauce can get so soggy and groos! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I tried this place again after bad food experiences in the past, and yet again Flos didn't deliver. The hostesses took our pick up order, but left out our lettuce wraps. When I called to have them charge the order back to my card, the hostess was snippy and told me that they could only take down my phone number so that next time I came in to dine there I could get credit. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love Flo's! The one at the Promenade is the best! The food is great and the service is always warm and friendly. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"awesome happy hour great service nice and light food always a great standby for any night or the week now they have asahi on tap"}
{"text":"Sorry Flo, however this place has really gone down hill. The food has gone down in quality, the service has gone down a few notches and the ambiance has never changed. I have noticed more and more bad reviews for Flo's. Last week was my last time in."}
{"text":"I love Flo's! Sweet and sour soup is the best I've ever had! I convinced my girlfriend who is extremely picky to try it, and she loved it! I enjoy sitting at the bar. This place has a cool atmosphere and the new remodel is inviting."}
{"text":"The first time we came here we had a great experience. The last 3 times, very disappointing.  Take out order was wrong and 2 times, service painfully slow. We sat Dow and I told server 'we're starving. I'll start with the salad rolls please.' 15 minutes later, asked where they were, and she said 'oh I thought you wanted it all together.' A table that came in about 10 minutes after us was served before us.  So by the time I go to eat my appetizer, my warm food was cold."}
{"text":"Love it!  Great food, prices, and service!!  Would recommend for dinein or takeout."}
{"text":"Been eating at Flo's since 2003. Last two times I was disappointed ordered yellow curry one word to describe \"horrible\", second time I ordered Kung pao chicken after sitting at the table for 15 minutes, when it finally came there was exactly 3 this pieces of chicken. May be I should stop coming here & look for other Asian food choices. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"+.+.+.+.+.+Two Things Have Changed in the Past 30 Days +.+.+.+.+.+.+  PRICES have been  increasing quite frequently ...... and they just did it again. Enough is enough ...... They now have become very expensive. We'll still continue going here ........ reducing our visits by 50%. There's a wonderful Chinese restaurant at Shea and 92nd Street that gives much  larger portions ..... at about the same price as Flo's.  Secondly the remodel is Beautiful ..... However, why wasn't the Rock Concert noise level remedied ?????"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I really know what good Chinese food is... It seems like all my favorite places growing up were soooo delicious. Now I end up at Flo's with coworkers about every other week and really do like it. Maybe it's the comfort of the food? Who knows.  I ate nothing but kung pao the first few times I came here because I loved it. I decided to experiment with the menu a little and so far the pad Thai and twice cooked pork are also delicious. So, either they make good food or I am easily pleased with salty meaty saucy woked food... Hmmm maybe a little of both.   Flo's EXCELS at getting people in and out and I love that as well. The portions are also perfect for lunch and usually under $10 including tip."}
{"text":"I am happy to update my review based on the very positive response by the owner Dustin regarding my visit.  He seemed truly concerned that we had experienced poor service, and insisted on making it right. The food was good overall, despite one issue.  My experience was that we came in for a late dinner, and it felt as if the staff was put out that we were there. When one dish came out wrong, the kitchen tried to say it was the right dish and the server didn't do anything to compensate for the issue. Toward the end of the evening, the server was not around and a busboy loudly stacked dishes behind us and then kept asking to clear dishes before we were done.   While nothing in  that experience would entice me back to Flo's, previous good dining experiences and Dustin's apology and commitment to making things right definitely makes my experience that night seem different from how he and his wife Flo want the restaurant run."}
{"text":"First off, let me say, that Flo's has been one of our favorite restaurants since she opened in the first location years ago.  The quality and the taste of the food is still excellent. The hot and sour soup is delicious and  the best we have ever had.   But, we went there for lunch on Sunday and to our disappointment, the lunch has changed drastically from what we are used to. The salad was very small, they longer serve the \"chips\" with sweet and sour sauce-which is great for the kids while they wait for the food, and the lunch portion size has decreased significantly. The dish is no longer enough to share, but more like an individual size with a scoop of rice. From a family who looks forward to eating at Flo's a few times a month for lunch, this is a huge disappointment. You have lost a loyal patron on this one, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Food was good, but nothing compared to the location on Frank Lloyd Wright.  Service is EXTREMELY slow.   We came at lunch, and the restaurant was only a 1/3 full.  We got our food before our lunch salads and drinks even made its way to the table.  We had to ask for the status on our soft drinks.  Will stick to my regular location where service is timely, and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Really poor service. So bad that I can't see us coming back anytime soon. The food just isn't special enough to overcome my bad experience."}
{"text":"What happened??  You took a beat up McDonald's and fashioned it into a nice place to go and have some amazing food.  I loved the food....and the people were awesome!  Seems like for two years things were pretty good..  Glory days!  Then... the wheels fell off.   Maybe it was sold?  Maybe they could not find decent help?  Maybe it's as simple as nobody there gives a crap?    It sure feels a lot less like a nice restaurant and more like a gathering place for a group of people intent on doing as little as possible.  Perhaps if I had not experienced Flo's during it's better days this would not be so obvious or sad.    Went there for dinner a few weeks back and although the place was half full we were seated at a table that had been cleaned by someone with an art background.   Little tidbits and other morsels where thoughtfully scattered on the table and chairs.  The floor was gross.  No other way to describe.  We ordered.  The food did arrive pretty quickly.  So that's good.  Some of it was not what we ordered so a few points off for that.  We called over the waiter who took it back and after a while did bring the correct order.     I will say the crab puffs were pretty good although I do like em chewy.  The best way to describe the food is to say it was ok...but it used to be great.  So the overarching impression as we walked out was this. The hospitality they used to exhibit has lessened greatly over time.   From entry to exit it was clear that taking care of diners was on the list....but not too close to the top.  Combine that with food that used to be awesome and now is average at best and you have a losing combination.    Cannot see any reason to go back....but would like to find one."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our quick lunch at Flo's. Very good! My panko chicken was excellent and my hubby's teriyaki bowl was delicious.  The salad was great too! Our water was refilled VERY quickly. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST happy hour everyday. The food is awesome and the service very good.  Flo's is a great place."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, have to admit the happy hour time was better and the Saturday lunchtime rush wasn't as good.  Perhaps it had to do with the fact that I was missing those delightful fruity drinks that pack such a wallop?  Sea Breeze?  I can't read my handwriting.  :(  THAT'S the sign of a good drink, ha ha, if you can't read your handwriting after two.  Drapps were great, full sized appetizers.  I liked the pot stickers, lettuce wraps, meat on sticks (there should be more meat on sticks in the world).  Sunday evening was great, Saturday lunchtime not really because it was so crowded and I suppose it is just me but I felt rushed though I didn't \"have\" to be rushed and no, the wait staff did nothing to rush me, it was just the overall atmosphere of Saturday lunchtime.  Yes, I'll return.  For one thing I'm thinking about those pot stickers and now I have a taste for them.  Wonder how they are on Wed. eve?  ;-)"}
{"text":"Few words worth spitting back up for this place, but the food certainly is. The last thing I would want to do is write an instruction manual for the management with my review and see this place survive as a result. Rude twenty something server, bland food, sad, sad vibe. Fresh spring rolls, \"summer rolls\" here, look like dog turd with worms. Wierd culture. Staff seemed miserable. Don't eat here if you value your time or money.   [Let's see if this gets removed by yelp like my wife's did]"}
{"text":"Visiting from our of town. Went to Flo's for dinner with a group of 8. Great food, quick service great ambiance. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"I loved the food . Specially you should definitely try the calamari it's great . One of the best Asian food in Arizona . But the only thing that which is taking short of one star is the service. Once they serve the food they vanish and is difficult to ask them to at least refill water or  drink . But apart from that it's definitely the best place to have Asian food."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Flo's tonight. I got the lemongrass beef with noodles and it did not disappoint! Very good flavor and quality. I don't remember what my husband ordered but he was very happy with his choice as well. We also split the house ginger salad which was a nice size to split and the dressing was delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Flos is the best food, period!  I have been eating here for over 12 years now and it is my favorite restaurant in the valley. The Kung Pao Chicken is absolutely amazing. Thank you for making such good food."}
{"text":"Food is OK - sometimes good - used to be great.  The service is terrible and a 25 minute wait for lunch on Saturday at 1:00?  Seriously?  It seems the restaurant relies on takeout - hostess ignored folks waiting to get on the wait list (irony intended) to serve carryout customers - could the tips have an influence? We were finally seated - had Shrimp Pad Thai and Red Chicken Curry - the curry was very good, but shrimp was overcooked and the dish tasted substantially different from last visit.  The restaurant is incredibly loud, to the point of distracting.   We used to go here often, but will be eating at other places from now on when Saturday shopping."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. In Tempe. Not a chain. Great remodel of McDonald's. Food is average. Service bad. Tonight ate at the bar. Bartender was too busy hanging out with his friends to wait on me. When I was done it took more than 20 minutes to get his attention to get my food picked up and a check.  Even tried waving my credit card at him. Didn't work. And I was sitting less than 3 feet away. Also found it disconcerting that one employee kneeled at the bar while a co-worker gave him an extended shoulder massage. Eeuw."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Really enjoyed the meal and the service was excellent.  Definitely will return.  Thank you Flo!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at Flo's!  The spicy shrimp was amazing and the service was spot on.  Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"All the food was full of flavor & extremely satisfying!  The best Hot & Sour Soup I have tasted. The staff was polite & helpful. They brought the wrong meal for my son & initially they forgot to bring our soup, but everything was quickly corrected.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"So good. Flo is the best. Staff works hard, but the food is so good, they could throw is at me and I'd still come back."}
{"text":"I usually go to Flo's on Thompson Peak but just realized there is one in the Promenade, which is closer to where I live. I always order the sweet & sour chicken with white rice. It's perfectly cooked (with a touch of crispiness). It's the best Chinese food I've ever had. I will be going again and again."}
{"text":"Was there on a very busy Friday night. We were seated immediately, and received very good and friendly service. We had the Thai chicken lettuce cups , Yellow Curry chicken, and Kung Pao chicken entrees. Food was flavorful, portions generous, and fellow diners were very pleasant. The owner (Flo) was circulating in the dining room, speaking to (classy casually fashionable to well-dressed customers) and graciously asking how their meals were. So nice to see restaurant ownership that sincerely CARES about their product and customers.  Top-notch Friday night stop with a good happy hour and app specials, good for a Friday/Saturday night date, and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I just picked up an order from the Scottsdale restaurant and found it uneatable.    The pot stickers were dried out, cold, and torn up; and had clearly been sitting around for sometime. The orange chicken was sooo bad we couldn't eat it and gave it to the dog. It made McDonald's chicken McNuggets look like haute cuisine. The chicken chunks were cold, old, and rubbery. The fried rice wasn't even fried, it was white rice with a bit of egg and oversized veggies in it. I could go on and on.   i recommend if you want Asian food go to Pei Wei or PF Changs not Flo's"}
{"text":"The drinks were excellent and the happy hour prices are good. Food is pretty lackluster - bland except for being over salted and fairly Americanized."}
{"text":"not  very pleased 2nd time around won't return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a few times. The first time we were invited for a party get together. We had a great experience and the food was great. So we have been returning to enjoy a great meal. We always get two of the same things on the meal, the crab puffs and the beef lo mien are our favorites! We always choice another different entree to get as well. There menu has a lot to choose from, so we never have a problem finding something that sounds good, more of a problem trying to just pick the one thing. So far everything we have ever ordered has been delicious. The portions are pretty big, we order two entrees to share and always still have leftovers to take home. I highly recommend giving this place a shot if you're looking for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, excellent quality, great service. Every time we've gone here, it's all been great - every time. The ONLY misgiving I have is that they , well, only give you enough for 1 meal without leftovers. I guess there's been built an expectation when you eat out at Chinese you pretty much get 2 meals.   Price is slightly high, but we don't mind paying for quality.   Oh and ignore the dorks here slamming them for not having wi-fi. Get a life and do your internet at home or starbucks or Barnes and Noble with the other social butterflies.   I hope they don't get wifi so the bar isn't filled up this 'those types' sitting with their laptops open on the bar - jeez. (or geeking out w/their phones)"}
{"text":"love this place and they do a great job with take out orders (better than the other location, in my opinion) and we go there at least 1-2 times a week.  pricing is great, food is so fresh and so tasty.  I always go for the soups, so much food I always have enough for leftovers :) love love love!"}
{"text":"Kat, at bar is awesome, try her wing sauce! Flo's management seriously add this to the menu."}
{"text":"I took my parents this this restaurant yesterday. We had been there twice before and found it good so we thought we would go back for a third time. That will be the last time. What could go wrong, actually did.  We were later than usual and was surprised how conversations and general noise carried in this place. We could not hear each other without raising our voices, also asking the speaking person to repeat what they had just said. Very uncomfortable. We ordered one of the lettuce wraps for an appetizer and could not eat them because of the high spice content that I did not see on the menu when I ordered them. That was a waste of money.  We ordered brown rice and ended up with white. Of course it was taken care of when we brought it to the server's attention but come on... Another server attempted to deliver an order to our table that was not ours and we had a hard time convincing her that it was not ours. The gentleman that was responsible for re-setting the tables was walking by and we all noticed that he was holding the clean water glasses in place as he walked with his chin inside the open part of the top glass. Ugh! Let's just say, we didn't drink any more water after we saw that! The server could not remember our order from our table to the ordering station and had to keep coming back for clarification. Service was slow and it took us forever to get our bill and then to have the opportunity to pay it. The actual main dishes were not as good as we had before and we had to once again chase with server down for dinner plates. All we had were the serving platters. Needless to say, the leftovers did not come home with us since they were not up to par the first time around. We were not impressed."}
{"text":"We came at a busy time and we're very impressed with our waitress, Katie. She was professional and friendly despite the busy rush. Even during happy hour, they managed to get our food to us in a reasonable amount of time, keep our drinks full, carry a light and polite attitude, and help us with decisions and questions about our meal.   Their curry was worth the trip alone, and with their tofu was delicious. It was an overall enjoyable experience with exceptional service. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Subpar food cuisine unknown. Service is fantastic but the food is terrible."}
{"text":"It seems like some people in North Scottsdale have low standards? The place is overly crowded I cannot understand why it's not that great. I ended up getting sick after eating here, not just me but my boyfriend too. Oh well, I gave it a try several times only because the location, I will make the drive to find something else."}
{"text":"The stench of what was once Flo's and is now garbage hangs heavy in the air.   I had the crispy tofu with mixed vegetables. Husband had shrimp pad Thai and BBQ pork slices.   Tofu was not crisp, was a strange shade of dark brown, had a terrible wet/mushy/sponge like texture and the sauce in the dish was completely flavorless. The smell coming off this dish was somewhere between dirty dishwater and abandoned stairwell - funny that something with no flavor would generate such an aroma.   BBQ pork was an experience that we do not wish to repeat, the meat quality was incredibly poor.   Pad Thai had unusually large noodles, eggs had strange color, really didn't have that Thai flavor, shrimp were ok but by the time the dish was halfway done they were soggy.   Even the rice was bad.   Yikes.  I'm off to light a scented candle and see if there is anything in the fridge."}
{"text":"I never dine in here, because it always seems too busy, so I just do take-out. The food is always great. I'm never dissatisfied. Women at the counter are always very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing soup with shrimp, chicken,  mushrooms, carrot julienne, and lemon grass.  Fabulous! Only place with better is Thai House."}
{"text":"The best Chinese I have ever had.   I live in the Bay Area of California and have a lot of options when it comes to Chinese. Quite often, we will pop up to Chinatown in \"the City\" for some Dim Sum, but there are the other kinds of Chinese restaurants closer to us that we have tried. None of these have ever come even close to tasting as good as Flo's. We think of it often and wish we were picking up some. Whenever on vacation we make sure to stop by here a least a few times. I see the mixed reviews below and have to wonder. I don't know if it's their tastebuds, or perhaps there are different chefs on different days (and we've just always got the best one), or if we just happen to order the best stuff on the menu, but we have no complaints at all and we can't wait to go back.   I HIGHLY recommend the Twice-Cooked Pork. MMMMM"}
{"text":"Definitely stay away from this flo's. the restaurant is half full and it took 35 min to get just the soup portion of our meal. Currently, we are 55 min into the new and we are still waiting on our food. When we mentioned the long wait time for the food, the waiter said 'we're really busy'. That probably explains he leftover food that was stuck to my water cup from the previous customer and the small piece of foil that was served on top one of the dishes...they are just too busy to care about quality when the restaurant is half full.   Do yourself a favor and only come here when it is 25% full, then it actually might function like a real restaurant. Otherwise, if you get here and it is close to 50% full or more, you'd be better off going to coffee bean across the parking lot for dinner or lunch.   Happy fortune (cookie)!"}
{"text":"Everybody in the North end of Scottsdale knows Flo's.  She's often in her restaurants talking to and help her patrons, she seems very dedicated to her menu and her guests dining experience.  There always seems to be something new on the menu, which is a great mix of all the Asian dishes and styles.  Which is what makes her menu so diverse. Whether it's Vietnamese, Thai, Indian, Mandarin, or Szechwan, Japanese or Korean, it all seems to be well represented.  It's hard to recommend any one thing, and I hate to be cliche' but her Lettuce Wraps seem to be the crispest, most flavorful I've had, a Must Have, no matter what else is ordered. I don't know where else you can go where you can sample so much that Asian food has to offer"}
{"text":"What a great meal! Very authentic and delicious. Had the shrimp and green beans. Light however full of great flavor. My husband had the crispy honey steak strips and spring rolls. Yummmmmm! Our server Tony rocks!!! All the staff were attentive and food came fast and hot! A wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food.  Best crab puffs anywhere.  Spring rolls, pot stickers, lettuce wraps: all delightfully prepared quickly. Thai Shrimp skewers are amazingly good.   Don't forget the cocktails.  Yum."}
{"text":"We love Flo's! It's a bit pricey but the food is great and the portions are large enough that we always have left overs for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"$5 sat lunch deal on sat, and happy hours are the best deals in town"}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles, when i am in Mesa and Tempe, AZ, i have to eat here everynight . Eveyone here are awsome and food is incredible. Jerry the manager and Stephenie the amazing server is why i come everytime when I am in this part of the country. COME HERE ONE TIME and you know if i am right."}
{"text":"I have been going to Flo's for many years and it is the best Chinese restaurant that I have found in Phoenix in the 18 years that I have lived here.  The atmosphere is nice, the wait staff are very attentive, you get to see and talk to Flo very frequently, which I think is pretty cool, and you get a lot of delicious food for the price.  I would highly recommend Flo's!"}
{"text":"Love the dinner here... its fresh, especially on the weekend.  Lunch is a bit more iffy.. I guess depends on the chef."}
{"text":"For the area, this is one of the better places to grab Chinese food from.  The starter salad has a great dressing on it that I always enjoy and the chips and sweet and sour dip are excellent.  Both get you ready for a good lunch.  I generally stick with the orange chicken here because it is quite good.  Unlike other versions of orange chicken, the taste of the orange in the sauce is distinct and there are even chuncks of oranges on your plate.  If I based my review on the food alone, I would give it a five.  However, the service here is, in my experiences, a bit weak.  The staff tend to take a nonchalante attitute and walk you to your seat and visit you occasionally.  I usually have to drag someone over for a refill of water or chips.  However, this has never just been outright awful, just weak.  If you enjoy Chinese food, Flo's is definately worth a try."}
{"text":"Very average.  Very overpriced.  Very disappointing.  We order $90 worth of take-out to try this restaurant and will not return.  Of 5 entrees and 4 appetizers, only the moo shu pork was worth recommending.  The lettuce wraps were bland...almost tasteless...and there were only 4 pot stickers per order (most places its 6 or 8).  The mongolian beef was OK but the garlic chicken & kung pao chicken were average at best.  Don't believe the hype...the recent reviews of Bryan M. and Julie M. are right, Flo's is just plain disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here with a girlfriend for happy hour on Friday, 8/17. The HH menu is half off all the appetizers on the main menu and half off all alcoholic beverages including wine, beer and the umbrella drinks. I really like the Chinese lettuce wraps (serves 2) which is regularly $7 but only $3.50 during HH. It's just as good as PF Chang's. I also liked the chicken wings which are breaded and deep fried. but not greasy I love the banana spring rolls for dessert (even though it was not half off). Only problem with this place is the noise level -- hard to hear other people amid the clanging of dishes and loud chatter. But for HH, can't beat it. And the service is always good."}
{"text":"This was the best Chinese food I have eaten in years!  The Moo-shoo chicken was excellent!  Apps were great also. Our sever was very accommodating to have noddles instead of rice on the kids meal.  Overall 5+ Stars!"}
{"text":"Menu tilts more Chinese than anything, but lacks an abundance of flavor.  The popular honey beef was just your basic sweet-soy glaze on some unfortunately soggy breaded beef strips (it would need to be a perfect crispy to work).  Salad at lunch from what appeared to be bagged lettuce mix didn't exactly inspire.  The lunch specials all came with fried wonton strips they called \"chips,\" which was interesting but didn't exactly add any flavor or color.    Service was friendly."}
{"text":"My family doesn't usually go to this location, and I have to say I was extremely disappointed with the service. Katie, with the blonde hair, was our server, and she definitely needs better training. In fact, much of your stuff just needs to be trained on basic teamwork as it relates to customer service.   We sat down 14 minutes prior to happy hour ending.  A busboy promptly filled our water glasses soon after we sat down.  But we never saw our server or even knew who our server was, until exactly 16 minutes later. We watched many other servers and bussers walk by our table, back and forth, MANY times, but no one ever made eye contact.  So frustrating.  We had all of our menus closed, sitting at the end of edge of the table within 5 minutes of being seated. Yet not a single person stopped to ask us if we needed anything, or if we needed our server.  Common sense and the look of disbelief on our faces would clearly have shown that we were not being taken care of.  When the server finally showed up, she was polite.  The lettuce wraps did not show up until the very end of our meal, and that's only because we finally had to ask about it (we would have asked our server earlier, but she would disappear for at least 5-10 minutes at a time, nowhere to be seen in the restaurant). She quickly blamed the kitchen, saying they are very slow on making that particular item. I've ordered that item at your other location dozens of times, and it usually comes out extremely quick.   Everyone at our table doubted the story.  I  think you need to meet with your staff, and teach them about basic teamwork. I was a server for several years in college, and you are taught that just because it may not be \"your\" table, doesn't mean you completely ignore the table and tune it out every time you walk past it.  A little bit of common courtesy would go a long way."}
{"text":"My better half and I started going to this Flo's on the recommendation of our Realtor, who told us about the ridiculously cheap $5.00 Saturday lunch special.  Our first visit was good.  However, subsequent visits chipped away the other three stars.  Service was always adequate, but never good.  In fairness, that could be just because we always went during the inevitable madhouse that comes with offering a $5.00 lunch special.     I first had the Mongolian Beef, which was excellent. However, every time I strayed from it, I was disappointed.  The rice is never good.  It's always dry, broken grained, and utterly tasteless.  I'm no fan of soggy vegetables, but Flo's swings the pendulum too far in the other direction.  Eating a dish with huge chucks of nearly raw green pepper that merely kissed the wok/saucepan is not enjoyable.  Tender-crisp would be appreciated.  The Shu Mai are the best I've had, but twice I had to send them back because they were trying to pawn off old, dried out, lukewarm ones that should have been tossed, and that's just insulting.  It's been quite a while since we've been to Flo's, and we likely won't return.  I wanted to share with you why."}
{"text":"This is possibly the WORST meal I have ever had.  I don't even know where to start. It was fairly crowded for a Sunday night which I took for a good sign. The wait staff is young but fairly attentive.  Our actual waiter was a bit of a dope and more concerned with the table of 5 chicks in his station.   Appetizers. We ordered the chicken satay. Super sweet and basic. We also ordered the spring rolls. Completely ordinary.    Meals. Eggplant/pork dish. I thought I was going to wear it home. The waiter literally almost sloshed it off The plate and in my lap. I just ended up with a gelatinous spill on the table.  It was so sweet it was almost inedible. Yellow curry was actually edible. Pho was probably the best option but not near as good as my favorite pho joint.   $50 but not my last meal. Bummed. Was hoping it might have promise for my new watering hole."}
{"text":"When she began opening up restaurants to compete with P.F. Chang's (so the rumor goes), it was a real reason to go, especially dinner hour.  Prices were really competative and food was good.  Now a few years later you might as well go to Chang's; you certainly will feel like you are paying for it.  There's no reason for a honey beef dish (deep-fried beef and sauce - that's it!) to be $13.  Yes it tasted good and yes they were quick, but I'll bet if you did some reasearch and took a few chances you'd find something similar in Mesa/Tempe/Chandler for half that or less.  Maybe even S. Scottsdale...  Lunch and happy-hour will be the best options.  It still tastes great, you just feel like you are getting what you pay for."}
{"text":"Had a Great dinner at Flo's tonight, Fried brown rice, non-breaded orange chicken, cashew chicken, lettuce wraps, tofu and vegetables and spring rolls.  Love the contemporary atmosphere."}
{"text":"I used to love Flo's.  We would go there once or twice a month.  Have moved out of the area, haven't been there in a year or so.  Went there for dinner on Friday night. Food tasted great.  All three of us had food poisoning all weekend long.  Needless to say, we won't coming back for a long time if ever."}
{"text":"I love the food & the value is great. Service is good, family friendly, nice ambience. It's my favorite place. We usually head out there on Friday's before 7pm to enjoy the happy hour with half off appetizers and alcoholic beverages.   Our usual order includes any one of the curry's, cashew chicken, basil chicken, yakisoba. The chicken on skewers are a great appetizer. They're pretty much always full house, but I've never had trouble being seated within about 5 mins.   Yaaay to Flo's!"}
{"text":"Flo and her team does it again! Great service and amazing lunch special! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Order the Duck, takes 24 hours! Worth it... Everything else and I have had all the apps and a large portion of the menu is alright. Also the layout is kinda wonky and awkward."}
{"text":"Odd menu, poor choices, poorly presented. The way the food is served is strange, they give you the cooked meat, with the flavor (sauce) on the side. Good rice. I was disappointed with the menu it is very limited as far as Asian restaurants go. They have no side dishes... I mean really? What is a Chinese dinner without a few side dishes? Comfortable dining room and a nice bar. The service was marginal, the  waiters seemed confused and not familiar with the menu, even as small as it is. They scrambled and wanted to charge me for a 13 dollar dinner, just because I wanted a side of noodles. I will not go back. Disappointing if you are used to really good Chinese food. To sum it up... find another place!"}
{"text":"Don't order take out from here! At least!! Though the quality of the food can't possibly be much better when you're eating in either. Ordered sweet and sour chicken and they didn't give any sauce. Who does that? It was just little crumbly looks like bacon but it isn't fried chicken bits and canned pineapple! And $13!! Don't do it! Flee! The pork shumai tasted like food poisoning so I only ate one of them. $6! Fleeee!"}
{"text":"Flo's was always a favorite during our many trips to Scottsdale years back. It's been about 10 years since our last experience so we were very excited to return.  This location, set in an interior strip in The Promenade shopping area is brightly decorated and spacious.    Our efficient server presented us with the regular and lunch menus and all our favorites were still listed. The lunch prices are reasonable but I'm not sure how they compare in size to the dinner portions....they appeared a bit skimpy from the Flo's we remembered.   We started with soup and pot stickers.  Their sizzling rice soup is the signature dish that brought us back to Flo's over and over again.  It's a humongous bowl fit for two that I used to eat all by myself as a main course.  It was flavorful with two patties of sizzling rice. The veggies and chicken were ample, the shrimp not so much. The chicken actually had a really weird, spongy consistency.  The taste was ok but I couldn't get over the texture.  For our main dish we got the shrimp and pan fried noodle and combination fried rice.  Both were good but they can keep the fried wontons they put on the side of their dishes...to me, they seem like filler to make the portions appear larger than they actually are.  Lunch at Flo's was not bad but I'll take a pass next time.  I'm more inclined to try someplace new in an attempt to capture that special experience we used to long for."}
{"text":"Meh. Yellow curry was watery and I've had better pad Thai from the frozen section. Not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Flo's kung pao chicken is the closest I've had in the US to what I used to eat in China. It's phenomenal! This alone merits 5 stars.  Flo's service is also fast and extraordinary. All dishes are great, but I wouldn't even consider leaving out the kung pao chicken!"}
{"text":"we started with 4 orders of chicken wings and 2 orders of calamari.  Both were crispy and well seasoned. We followed that with 3 orders if siu mai. I was underwhelmed but the other 11 in our party liked them.  After that they came with 2 orders of special fried rice 1 brown rice and 1 white rice, 2 orders of honey beef (SPECTACULAR), Chow fun ( a bit salty), beef chow mein (good), cinnamon chicken (a novelty order that reminded me of lebanese chicken), mushroom chicken, ginger spicy onion beef (super zippy and good), some breaded chicken thingy with a brown sauce on the side (think katsu and it was pretty standard), thai curry chicken and finally the hot chili oil sirloin beef (tasty and i liked the contrast with the water chestnuts).  Some of the food was surprisingly good and some of it was a bit standard.  But I would eat here again even with it being more expensive than my usual digs.  The tea was never refilled, the water took awhile but the food came quickly and hot. Also, they didnt freak out at my 1 yr old niece eating so sloppily."}
{"text":"Flo's Suck! Below average tasting Chinese Food at super high prices.  I'm from Hawaii and use to excellent authentic tasting Chinese Food. For example if you go to Hawaii (Oahu), there's an excellent Chinese Food restaurant where all the locals go called \"He Hing\" across from the famous \"Leonard's Hawaiian Bakery\". Don't waste your hard earned money eating here at Flo's. Seem's like Flo is a bit money hungry with her off the wall high prices, for just O.K. food.  There's a great Chinese Food Restaurant in Mesa, AZ called \"Best Hong Kong Dining\" on Southern Ave/Dobson Rd. Excellent roasted duck with whole cooked ducks hanging on hooks (like the old days). The food is fabulous and the service is friendly.  Regards, J.D."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Scottsdale. Great Happy Hour prices, delicious food, and cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour with great prices and delicious food but be prepared for loud indoor dining with 'can't be bothered' wait staff. The silver lining is that we were served by Stephanie. Because of her we go back."}
{"text":"Did not know anything about Flo's Asian Kitchen saw it on a business meeting I was having in the area and I'm going to tell you it was fantastic they gave me chips and some kind of Asian hot sauce before my meal came and the salad was crisp the dressing was delicious and then my food came very quickly that was also exceptionally tasty I would recommend this to anyone in that area and I will be going there again and I didn't really know what to order and the server was incredibly helpful so Flo's Asian Kitchen thumbs up"}
{"text":"Always good at Flos!! A neighborhood favorite! Nice friendly atmosphere & quick service at lunch!  It's nice to catch this busy place slightly off peak hours to avoid wait time."}
{"text":"Went for lunch after main rush was over at about 12:45. Place was half empty but got seated in far corner table.Service was terrible. The waitress appeared to want to be anywhere but there. Salad came and was swimming in dressing. Every table had won-tons but we were not served any. We had to ask and were served them part way through our main dish. My wife's orange chicken arrived and was cold, tasted like fish and was chewy. My entree arrived 10 minutes later. The Mongolian beef was chewy and poor quality. Wrong rice was brought and had to be exchanged for our ordered brown rice. We have eaten here many times and it was okay. Today was a radical departure for even classifying it as good. We won't be back. Flo's has gone way downhill and the service which was never stellar was terrible."}
{"text":"What is up with todays lunch service?? It wasn't my first time eating at Flos, just my first time writing about them.   The waitress was very rude and seemed like she was bothered to be a waitress. Last time I checked, working in the restaurant industry meant serving people their food and drinks. Ms waitress thought different, she thought, let me sigh and roll my eyes to these people. UNTIL the big lady herself walked in, FLO.  Ms drama filled lazy waitress turned a 180, and started smiling, and saying, \"yes, of course I'll refill your drink because I've been ignoring you until my boss walked into the restaurant, now I have to pretend I was happy all day.\"   Anyway, aside from ms lazy waitress. I love going to Flos, and will always continue going to Flos.   If Flo reads this, check the attitude of some of the servers, a smile and courtesy goes a long way in the industry. Don't take away the singapore rice noodles, IT'S MY FAVORITE! Food is GREAT, but the dining room noise is something to get used to. It's like sitting in a very large living room."}
{"text":"I've been going to Flo's for years.  Chinese food can be hit or miss.  We decided to give it a try one day when she had her old resturant across the street from where she is now.  The food was awesome.  It didn't take long before word caught on and she had to open a bigger place.    Her food at this location is excellent (although I've tried some of her resurants and they are not as good) and she is usually there working.  Lunch menu is a great value and so is happy hour.  It is always busy, so go early.  Never had a bad meal or experience.  The only negative, it gets very loud in the dining room."}
{"text":"Again, we enjoyed a nice lunch on a recent Saturday at Flo's.  The $5 lunch menu has to be the best deal in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We've come here several times for lunch, as it's close to work. It's mediocre. I'm a vegetarian and they don't have a ton of options -- they have the usual stir fry veggies, veggie lo mein, veggie fried rice. I opt for the crispy tofu and veggies with brown rice.   I'd suggest to STAY AWAY FROM THE TEA. Their iced tea is gross, and probably a Nestee product. They don't brew it, and if they do, I don't know what kind of crap they use. My only gripe with Flo's.   Overall, it's an average experience with Chinese food -- for an average lunch price ($8-11)"}
{"text":"The food was good, I just took issue with what how they decided to handle a challenge. I ordered my lunch and was given the option of white or brown rice, I chose brown. I was never notified of an issue with my choice and when the waiter brought the food, he dropped it and said \"we are out of brown, it will take 15 minutes to cook so I got you white.\" He never asked if that was ok, never mentioned the problem until my food was in front of me.  On top of that there was no apology or service recovery. I just felt it was just handled poorly with little regard for my happiness."}
{"text":"Well, I came in here to get an order to go .I will start by saying the customer service is fantastic. I came a little after 1:30 so they were not quite as busy as the lunch rush would be. The restaurant itself is sparkling clean and I love that.The tables are spaced out nicely,so you are not sitting so close to others. I really like that. I placed a to go order, and it was ready so fast. It was still piping hot when I got home which was fantastic!  We got the Chinese Hot and Spicy Soup-Amazing. It had chicken and Shrimp in it. I would totally get that again. Also got the Beef and Broccoli and the Shrimp Pad Thai noodles. Both came with rice and you could get Brown or White rice. Everything was fantastic. I really like the Pad Thai, the Noodles are different than the Thai version. But, still very good. The ladies restroom was so clean, and that was after the lunch rush. It was large with amble soap, paper towel,and it even smelled nice. I will be visiting this place more often. I just never knew  what I was missing there. I always thought I would stop in there one day. Parking can be busy,since it is in a busy shopping center. It is right next to Whole Foods on Rural."}
{"text":"Flo's always has great food and will accomodate allergies if made aware.   I love the lettuce wraps and Chicken rice soup.  I add skinny rice noodles to the soup and make it a meal."}
{"text":"We ordered take out pad thai.  We got back to the condo and realized that there were literally very little to no spices in it that would make us think it's pad thai.  Also, it seems that they use egg noodles versus the classic thin rice noodle.  So, overall, we were very disappointed and would not return.  If you're looking for some meat and noodles in some kind of bland sauce, then try it.  We sat at the bar while we waited for our food  The drinks were ok, just like any other place, however the difference is that they have asian wines here instead of a classic cab or Reisling.  Just disappointing over all.  The egg rolls were \"spring rolls\" and again not very tasty and kind of bland."}
{"text":"The food is probably the best in the Phoenix area. Service is very good and the selection of dishes is large. Only complaint is the lack of teapots (only have 3) for patrons requesting hot tea with their meals. The cups are small and the waiters bring you one cup at a time if the teapots are in use by other patrons. A real turn off!!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg we went (I had to go back because I was invited by a family and I didn't want to tell them anything negative). I couldn't believe that we waited almost 3 hours for our meal Friday night it was raining it was packed but we sat there  waiting forever!!  Then they brought the food separate we got some food then we waited for other people and then we gave up and ate and then finally finished, meanwhile some of our party finally got the food.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Lunch at Flo's today. Haven't been here in a while as the quality of the food has been inconsistent over the last couple years. Surprised, plenty of seats open. Lunch was very good. My girlfriend thought so too. Service was good also"}
{"text":"It was a very good and chip place not long time ago. With new menu came new prices and gone services.  Hot tea was cold and served in tiny coffee cup. They brought wrong order and we waited for tea refill forever. Food was tasteless and when I complained to manager she was arrogant and rude. We lost one more place to go. Never again"}
{"text":"Just returned from the worst dining experience I've had in years ~ the restaurant was loud and you couldn't hear those dining across the table from you ~ the service was poorly timed, bringing out the soup with the entrée and overloading an already too-small table with too many and poorly matched dinnerware and utensils for the food items served ~ we ordered Manhattans that were served in tiny glasses with ice and apparently no alcohol at all ~ the food was average at best and the wait staff unattentive and rushed in a half full restaurant.  What should have been an enjoyable and relaxing evening was beyond disappointing.  Will never return."}
{"text":"Great prices, nice atmosphere, and the food is fantastic.  This is the best Asian restaurant around by leaps and bounds."}
{"text":"First off, the food and the prices are outstanding. As for the dining experience, pathetic comes to mind. Whoever the Architect was that converted the old McDonald's (Tempe location) has absolutely no concept of noise management. It kind of reminded us of a high school cafeteria. The place is an echo chamber and you can't even hear the person sitting next to you. I was in a party of 10 on Saturday night and every single one of us was thankful to leave. We actually stood in the parking lot for 20 minutes (110 degree heat) talking because we couldn't do so inside. What a shame because $1000.00 could fix it."}
{"text":"I've been eating here practically every weekend for the past three years!  Today, was a huge disappointment as I was dissatisfied with something I ordered, and told they were not going to replace it!  I'm sorry but when you see my face in there every week and want to treat me that way I will NOT patronize your facility!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for half price apps, the pot stickers and and skewered bbq chicken.  Was pleased with the value and would stop back in.  Little to no atmosphere.  Would have to try again to recommend."}
{"text":"Flo's...I'm a fan.  Been living in AZ for over 10 years and this is one of the most consistent Asian/American cuisine in the valley.  The food is pretty solid.  They have a wide variety of dishes, I'm a fan of most of them.  They have tasty curry dishes and great soups,  The lunch portions and prices are decent, but their dinner prices are a little pricey.  They used to have 5 dollar dishes on Saturday, but now they are 6, I usually hit that up and their happy hours.  One thing I do love about Flo's is their Lettuce Wraps.  They have Lao and Chinese style...go with Chinese!  Hence my background.  This place is pretty solid, I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stick to the Ginger Broccoli Beef. Everything else is so heavy on the oil that you're bound to have bouts of diarrhea. Seriously. This isn't my first time here either, so you'd think I'd learn my lesson by now."}
{"text":"Great service, the owner is marvelous and the food is amazing!! Will definitely come again, no question about it!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Pho I have ever had. The soup tasted like roast beef soup. It was brouwn and the vegetables were old and wilted. They did not even serve the soup with a soup spoon. Don't ever order the pho."}
{"text":"This my favorite Asian food place in North Phoenix!  I haven't had anything that wasn't delicious and fresh.  Even the Take-Out rocked!"}
{"text":"Some of the best egg foo in town ., Flo's been around for awhile ., keeping it a solid with your favorites orange chicken is a must !!"}
{"text":"Love their happy hour.  Food is good beer is great. Excellent spot to hangout after work"}
{"text":"We've been to Flo's approximately a dozen times since they opened and we have had excellent service and great food every time."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!!!  Best fried chicken my husband has had,  ever!  His words,  not mine.   Service was superb!!!  Manager was walking around making sure everyone's food was to their liking,  including us of course.   My son is a very picky eater and he loved the orange chicken,  without the green stuff Lol!  Highly recommended:)"}
{"text":"Food just okay nothing special. As a lunch that is okay, for dinner NOT. The staff customer service is mixed. Been there twice and the hostess in the front was terrific, the bartender was cool, the waitress - oh no!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Tempe.  Happy hour is 3-7 with 1/2 price apps & alcohol drinks.  Place was busy but service was still great.  We ordered from the appetizer menu Thai calamari, Thai shrimp skewers, Chinese lettuce wraps & Crispy spring rolls.  Quick service, water glasses filled & yummy food.  We will come back soon.  If you need gluten free they have lots to choose from."}
{"text":"We have been to Flo's twice. Both times we enjoyed the shrimp pad thai the most. If you go for lunch the services are just the right size and you get crispy won ton noodles also! Service was adequate both times.  Lunch can get busy depending on the day of the week so the service at that time is less personal, but with a large crowd that can perhaps be expected. They have lunch specials, so it is a good way to try more than one dish to find your favorite. The decor is very casual, chairs are not comfortable, but they perhaps want you in and out so they can keep turning the tables. We were told they do not take reservations, so be aware if you are on a time crunch. Not a place to have a business meeting, not too many tables that are private and it gets loud so not easy to have a confidential conversation. Hot and sour soup was very good!"}
{"text":"Boy, were we underwhelmed. Went there for lunch with my mom and was disappointed in the service. They forgot our appetizer and then, when we were almost finished with our entrees, they brought it out. We sent it back. They never asked us if we wanted something to drink other than water. Food was very, very average. Having not been here for many months, I think I'll stay away."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a modest price.  I got the orange chicken and asked them to spice it up. They brought it out really quick, almost frighteningly quick. With it came a side of rice.  I went there on a date and really enjoyed the experience. My only concern was that the walls were plain, but that's just a little hurdle to get past.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I would lean towards 3.5 stars simply for some changes in the years we've been coming here for work lunches. But because I still enjoy them...we'll go 4 instead of 3.   They are pretty quick for lunch and you get a salad, your lunch entree and a healthy sized serving of rice with a few won ton chips thrown in for a reasonable price. This is where that half star comes in...they used to provide a bowl of wonton chips and a cup of sweet and sour like chips and salsa style when you would be seated. And it seriously made my day every time. I'm sure people would fill up and they would throw some out, but I seriously adored it and was bummed when that practice stopped. I get it, truly. But I like what I like.   They flavor is decent. I always get the Kung pao chicken. Like some other reviewers have said its not the spiciest but I wouldn't call it bland. Mine is always filled with jalapeños and full red chilis cooked into it. It's the right amount of kick to meet the likes of most I'm sure.   We've always had decent servers, usually great ones in fact.   But there are some changes they've made to the presentation just change it from what felt like a nice dinner place for lunch to an upscale Panda Express for lunch."}
{"text":"I am definitely pro Flo's. Every lunch is accompanied by a generous helping of won ton chips, sweet and sour sauce and a fresh salad with miso dressing. My favorite dish is their [insert any meat here] low mein. It's exploding with flavor and they let you customize your order if you want chicken and beef.   The service is always great. The servers and staff are ninjas, (yes, very appropriate) -- glasses of water appear before you look up from your menu and empty dishes disappear. Everyone who works there is always smiling and looking to help, even when they are serving half the city.  Best of all, this weekend, we discovered the $5 lunch special on Saturdays. The line was out the door, but it was so so worth the wait. Every lunch special highlighted in red is just five dollars until 3:00. I was reunited with my de-lish lowmein for less than what I'd spend at Subway. Now that's something to smile about."}
{"text":"Where in the Valley can you find Happy Hour 7 days a week from 3-7? Where?  Tell me! lol .... Well, I'm sure there's other places but I haven't experiences them .. nor have I experiences any Asian Fusin/Chinese food in the Valley as good.  I've been here at least 3 times since Flo's opened.  Thus far I've tried the shrimp lo mein, Teriyaki salmon, Chicken wraps and the Hot and Sour soup.  My goodness ... the Hot and Sour soup is absolutely delicious!  Theeeee best!  There's also a really good Pomerita they make ... it's not your average Pomerita but it's delicious. All the 3 times I've been I've never had to wait for seating, either at the bar or in the dining area.  2 thumbs up for me! Give Flo's a try :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful  service and food from start to finish. Fast service. Hot food. Our waitress was super nice and all wait staff and bussers  were super friendly  as well. I was very impressed  on how clean the restaurant was as well. Prices were awesome. And we went during happy hour so appetizers were way cheaper.  It was $50 after tip. We got drinks, 2 appetizers,  soup,  and 2 meals. We had plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"This place is packed on Saturdays and as I read about their lunch deal on Saturdays for 6$ ,I am kind of unbelievable .Even I called up before I reach there to make sure about the deal.:-)  As we entered on a Saturday afternoon, we found the place is almost filled and our waitress helped us getting a table very quickly and she answered all my questions very promptly. So here I explain the deal of Saturday. Anything on their lunch menu (Entrees) are absolutely 6$ complimented with a salad and a choice of white/brown rice.  Apart from that , I give the stars for their staff and taste of the food. This place is highly recommended on your lazy weekends or when your taste buds demands some Asian food."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews a few weeks ago, I bookmarked this place. My husband and I were so looking forward to having a late lunch here today.  Not sure what's going on at this place but the service was non existent. As soon as we walked in we got seated in an area with about 4 other diners eating lunch. It was kinda strange but it was very quiet in this restaurant.  A wait person, with a frown on her face approached our table and poured us some water and handed us our menus. I mean it was blatant that this server was not having a good day. I asked her nicely if lunch was still available and she frowned again and this time at my husband. Who by the way wasn't even speaking.  After she walks away, another 5 minutes go by and I flag her down and ask again where our waitress was. Again, another frown.  At that point, knowing that we were going to have a minimum $25 plus meal here my husband and I both decided to walk out and eat at a place that wants our business.  The funny thing about the whole thing was as we were walking out, a girl behind the bar area says, \" have a good day. \"  To which I replied to, \" that would be great if we actually got to eat. \" Usually I would take the time to talk to management but I just got the feeling that they really didn't care. It was already so obvious to us.  Again, not sure what's going on here and super disappointed but there's a serious disconnect with how they treat their customers and what they need to do to keep them.  This was by far the worst customer service we have ever experienced in AZ as it was just basically non existent."}
{"text":"A seemingly fresher Chinese takeout but lacking in flavors. Placing the takeout order by phone was problematic. It seems the person did not know the menu well, so we were off to a bad start anyway. Then the food overwhelmed me."}
{"text":"Flo; she's a neighborhood celebrity. And her restaurant, a crowd favorite. I've been a regular, almost weekly, customer for 17 years! Almost everything I've tried has been tasty. My go-tos: hot and sour soup, house chow mein, orange chicken, and lettuce cups. Lunch and happy hour have great deals and dishes too! Good value, good food, and it's always a bonus when you get to see the famous Flo!"}
{"text":"Love Flo's!  Good food, inexpensive and quick!  I have been going to Flo's for lunch for quite a while now.  They do indeed have a new menu, but still have all the lunch time favorites available, you may have to ask for them if you don't see them on the menu.  You can get salad, rice and an entree for lunch for around $7.  Their food is so delicious you will want to eat the entire meal in one sitting, but I always try to save some for leftovers.  I am really picky about Asian food, and this restaurant tops my list!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese I've had in AZ. The food was soooo good, so hot and fresh, and the flavors were fantastic! They offer more than just Chinese food here (Vietnamese, Thai, some Indian) and the menu is creative and dynamic; it's not just the stale same-old same-old. They provide fresh and exciting twists on staples or do the classics very, very well. I can't emphasize how good the food tasted... everything we tried was amazing.  The atmosphere was very upscale-looking, so you get a nicely-decorated and upscale dining experience for the usual affordable price of any other Chinese restaurant. The service was good, too: kind and attentive. I am obsessed with Flo's and will be returning again."}
{"text":"The service tonight was absolutely amazing and we were well taken care of.  Flo the manager was exceptional and the waiter was awesome!  Your food is fabulous as always and I can't thank you enough for everything.   I will always recommend your locations to others and next time I will come see you in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My mom loves it. My daughter loves it. I like it.   Their lunch special is a great deal; one evening I went in for a late dinner and was offered the lunch special price if I wanted less food. That was actually impressive to see that they would offer lower pricing way after the lunch hours. So that's a plus.  Things to try:   Calamari appetizer: Just enough spice to make you drink the recommended daily amount of water. Tossed with red peppers and spices that will make you wish you didn't have to share with the table.   Spicy Shrimp Chow Mein: Jalapenos make this dish S-P-I-C-Y...a good thing! The noodles may be a bit overdone with a tad too much sauce, but overall it's a good dish.   Thai Coconut Soup: This is delicious. Brimming with veggies, and several floating pieces of chicken and shrimp. Must try.  The place can get a bit noisy on some days but it's affordably priced and a nice break from having to cook at home. One and a half thumbs up."}
{"text":"I usually come once a week or so for lunch. We just had dinner there, it was a little busy but not crazy. Server took forever to greet us. Think her name was Nicole. Our food took so long. Think it was an issue as another sever was telling his table near us. He apologized. Our server did not. Really goes a long way. Very disappointed in the whole experience. Even worse bc I now have a bad stomach ache."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place to eat!  The lemon chicken is the best!  We have excellent service every time we go there.  The price is the lowest we paid in years.  We now are regulars and eat at Flo's at least twice a week!  Thank you to the staff and Kevin who manages a great place!"}
{"text":"The food was amateur at most, A+ to service though. The food wasnt that great for the price, but edible. Go to P.F. Changs instead."}
{"text":"Everytime to this place is different, really like the fusioness they do with the food, like the crab puffs, jalapeños chicken wings"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Luckily, the last time I went was a hit with the yellow curry with chicken.   I have been coming here for about 4 or 5 years. When momma is in the house, the food is generally better. (Flo) Come in for Saturday lunch special for $5. Yes, I said $5. All the special entrees come with salad. Reg. $7.50-8.50 during the week.   I also like the pad thai and spicy chicken chow mein. It has these tiny but potent jalapenos. Man, it has the burn, but really probably my second favorite dish. If you do not like spicy, stay away from that one!"}
{"text":"This food is terrible. I ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken and it smelled not only of fish but it tasted like it too. I could only pick at it and that was about it. My friend ordered the katsu chicken and it was a rip off. The chicken was cut super thin and super small. Very disappointing. The dumplings were terrible. They were hardly cooked and tasted like the dough was only half cooked. If we weren't so hungry we would not have ate them. It took 9 minutes to get our tab after we gave the waitress our card. Not impressed with this place."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming here and the food is exquisite. I ordered the curry the first time and it was flawless. I had the pad Thai this time around and it was wonderful. I think I may have found my new favorite dish. The staff is friendly except I am not sure why there was 5 or 6 of the girls standing at the counter just talking. I only needed one person to help me lick up the take out. I am also disappointed with them stuff my paper bag to the top and not folding over the top. I don't understand why they didn't just use two bags. There was no parking so the bag ripped and I lost the chips that came with the meal. Not impressed with that. It is super noisy in the restuaunt so I recommend take out!"}
{"text":"This place has an AMAZING happy hour....tons of apps and drinks for super cheap."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  Flo's has a great atmosphere, very clean, casual and modern... but none of the food was great.    We started with shrimp rangoon and lettuce wraps.  The rangoon was OK - I didn't see or taste any shrimp at all, pretty sure it was all cream cheese.  The chicken filling for the lettuce wraps was so salty and oniony - not so good.  Entrees were orange chicken and cashew beef.  The chicken was just OK - sauce was too sweet.  The beef was the best dish - really tender and well flavored, but so salty.  I prefer my local Chinese place in St. Louis over this upscale but disappointing restaurant."}
{"text":"Our favorite location and always satisfied here  Great happy hour food and beverage specials. Not sure what others are complaining about! More than 10 years coming to this location and they are always consistent, delicious and accommodating."}
{"text":"Love Flo's! Why the three stars? Because the Flo's at the Promenade DOES NOT compare to the Flo's on Thompson Peak. The food at the Promenade location is lacking. The Katsu was dry, the soup blah, and the meat was just bland. The service is awesome, which redeemed the visit (been there several times), but if you want the real experience, go hit up the Flo's on Thompson Peak."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Asian restaurant in the valley. Happy hour is from 4-7, seven days a week, with half price appetizers and drinks. Everything I've eaten here has been fantastic. The spicy shrimp and pork wontons and house roast pork are to die for. I'm coming in next week for the Peking duck."}
{"text":"We've liked everything we've tried here - the hot and sour soup is the best we've found anywhere.  We always wind up getting an order to take home.  Service has always been prompt, cocktail list and beer selection is good as well.  My wife and I are both partial to the seafood guoba as our favorite dish on the menu.  It's close and convenient, and a guaranteed good meal every visit."}
{"text":"We've been to Flo's in Tempe several times. Unfortunately, the food is not consistent. Last night we did take out; the order was incorrect - included a pork dish & we don't eat meat. They did correct the Oder but by then the vegi egg rolls were ice cold. The \"experience\" was ruined & most of it is ready for Fri trash day. Expansion without quality control just simply isn't worth it."}
{"text":"So I went here for LUNCH on a SATURDAY while in town visiting friends and it was sooo good, for one their lunches on Saturdays are 5$ but even when not on special they are only 2$ more... and let me just say it was sooo delicious I shared about four dishes among 2 people and myself (we ate semi-light) my favorite of the 4 was the sweet and sour chicken it was very crisp light breading and juicy wonderful chicken... tone of the other members in my party enjoyed the egg plant chicken, and the other said she most enjoyed the pork fried rice so it is clear to say ALL the dishes were tasty. I would def. reccomend"}
{"text":"We had a big group who needed lots of food that we could all enjoy, so of course we turned to Chinese food!   Heard about Flo's, looked up the menu, and was really impressed with how extensive it was. Given the size of our group, we were able to try a pretty wide array of options: pot stickers, noodle soup, Mongolian beef, Kung Pao chicken, curry, and sweet and sour pork. I sampled most of it, and everyone was really pleased. We especially liked how they have classic dishes with authentic flavors and not super diner-y or greasy Chinese takeout.   So if you're looking for a modern presentation of classic Asian dishes, check out Flo's and I think you'll be pleased!"}
{"text":"Flo's is great. Quality ingredients, consistently good & well trained staff. Thanks Flo!"}
{"text":"This was our first time back in a couple years to see if the food had improved at all. Unfortunately, it hadn't. Filling for the lettuce cups was greasy and flavorless. Stir-fried vegetables were boringly bland. And the black tea was thin and appeared to have been brewed long ago. But the service was good. Maybe we'll try again in 2019. Not."}
{"text":"Family night out with my wife, our two kids, and her parents and we thought we'd have a great night at Flo's. Unfortunately service was horrible and the food was ice cold when we received it. It took exceptionally long to receive our food and when we did we were so hungry we started eating. The waiter didn't return for a long while and when he did he took three of our dishes. They were not brought back for over 15 minutes, and even at that point only two were brought back. They brought a third one shortly after, but it wasn't what we had ordered, so this just added to the frustration.   When the manager stopped by (I think she was actually the owner) she said they take the food right from the kitchen to the table and was somewhat argumentative which shocked me. She offered no resolution at all. I'm not the type to complain, and this is my first review of any type using yelp or any other online tool, but felt so compelled to do so after her attitude.   I've been to Flo's many times and unfortunately this will be my last."}
{"text":"Their happy hour specials are great. Don't pass on the wings, they are worth the wait. I don't think the food here is as good as the Scottsdale location, although I haven't eaten there in a few years. The menu is hit and miss. I love their mushu pork and katsu chicken. Some of the other items are generic, so so Chinese takeaway staples."}
{"text":"It's always fun to see new restaurants come up in the area & an Asian Fusion restaurant is definitely right up my alley. We had some evening plans so we just got a couple of dishes to go from Flo's.  The first thing we noticed when we walked in was that the interior is very modern & sleek-looking. There's quite a bit of sit-down seating as well as a few seats at the bar.  After a look over the menu, I wanted to try something different but ended up ordering the Kung Pao chicken with white rice and my date got the Singapore BBQ Pork Noodles.  The Kung Pao chicken was fine but I found myself wishing there was a little bit more flavor & spice. Also, the veggies that were tossed in with the chicken were different than what you usually find in this dish. It all tasted just okay. The Singapore BBQ Pork Noodles were definitely different and interesting. I didn't get too many bites but I thought the ones I did seemed mostly bland. Typically noodle dishes aren't served with rice but this one was.  I thought that the price was not justified. The dishes were both much more expensive than I was expecting in the first place, and then after eating what was served, I didn't find it was worth it. My date did not eat any of the rice so I think it would've been better to have an option of not getting rice and paying a little bit less for that entrée. Overall, I don't feel like I have much of a reason to return."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch HORRIBLE...Bad service RUDE server and when \"FLO\" came over to the table she was also rude!  I hadn't been to a Flo's in eight years...Things have changed!  Its ok to treat customers like that and is OK'd by the owner!  Flo's no more..."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant !! Food is excellent.  Great Happy Hour too.  The staff is on top of it all. Can't say enough about Flo's."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix on travel, this place was suggested for happy hour.  Well the server didn't know the specials.  Then when we ordered some other person dropped food off at the table with an attitude.  Server had to be flagged down to get assistance.  We called the manager over to tell him about the service.  Glad I don't live there and wont go back if i did.  Maybe service is better at the bar than table service."}
{"text":"I just moved to Scottsdale last Friday and for some reason on my first night in town I just had a craving for Chinese food.  My husband had been living here since April, so he had been to Flo's a couple of times, so he suggested we go there.  We walked in around 4:30pm on Friday and were seated quickly.  The place isn't very large and it's decorated simply but nicely.  We were pleasantly surprised to hear that it was Happy Hour.  Everyday from 3-7pm all alcohol and all appetizers are half off.  What a deal!  I even heard the waiter for the table behind us telling them that many people come in for happy hour and just order an assortment of appetizers.  Sounds like a great plan for some other time, but we were pretty hungry.  We had an order of spring rolls, I had katsu chicken, and my husband had general tso's chicken (this was on a separate summer menu).  The katsu chicken was very tasty, my only complaint is that the panko breading starts to get soggy as soon as they pour the sauce on top, so eat fast.  The general tso's, on the other hand, had a different breading that was perfectly crispy even after adding the sauce.  It was not at all spicy like the menu indicated, but were were perfectly fine with that.  Pricing was reasonable, service was good, and food came out quickly.  We will definitely be back.  I particularly would love to try the peking duck (note that it requires 24 hours advance notice)."}
{"text":"Flo's is a good option for happy hour Asian fare.   It's located right off FLW and Thompson Peak.   The Happy hour deal is pretty decent ($5 for specific/well drinks and 50% off most apps.) While you get a good deal price wise, you kinda get what you pay for. The food is average \"American Chinese restaurant\", it's tasty but not exciting or memorable.   It's usually slammed with the early bird crowd so there's always a decent wait for whatever you order. They also keep the restaurant pretty dark and it gets loud in there so be mindful of that."}
{"text":"Flo's lunch deal is good bargain. The dishes are usually around 7$ and come with a salad with a tasty dressing and bowl of won tons with a nice orange dipping sauce. I usually order the Teriyaki bowl and they now have the option of white or brown rice. It is enough food that I can only eat half of it and bring the rest home for dinner. I enjoy the ultra quick water refills as well. You can't beat the lunch deal I recommend it highly! Only complaint is that it can get a bit noisy when it's packed and it's usually packed!"}
{"text":"Flo's made me sad.  Walking in, I was optimistic.  The restaurant was open and inviting, and the food smelled good.  Perusing the menu I still optimistic.  The selection was decent, with some interesting choices.  Then I saw Spicy Malaysian chicken and I smiled.  For those of you that don't know, Malaysian food is one of my favorite things in the world.  I'd kill a man to get a decent Lemak dish.  Chicken was ordered and our efficient server had the food out in no time.  My chicken looked...orange.  I'm not sure how else to say it.  It just didn't look all that spicy.  Sadly, it didn't taste spicy either.  It tasted quite a bit like orange chicken, which is most assuredly NOT Malaysian in origin. Did I mention that it wasn't spicy?    So to sum up, the place is nice, the service is good and the food is kinda bland.  I'd eat here again, but I would order differently"}
{"text":"Have gotten take-out here several times and usually enjoy it. But the last time, the food was VERY salty. MSG??  Also, the dishes we ordered, pork lo mein, broccoli beef, and cashew chicken, were too dry - not enough sauces. Will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Good food but when trying to get takeout it takes forever. I had to wait 25 minutes after waiting about 15 minutes before leaving. This was not the first time either. Staff is nice and friendly. Cool bar too."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service is spotty.  It seems there are whole new crews every time we go in, and we have moved to order take out more often over dining in. The best thing about Flo's food is that it is the best food the day after."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed my meal. They are well priced for how much food you get. I highly recommend this chain."}
{"text":"I have to update my earlier review because I've become a regular of this place, and quite a fan!    This is still not your 'Bay Area' Chinese restaurant, but given the location and demographics, you aren't going to get that here in Scottsdale and I accept that now.  I've settled on several good dishes, and the place is always crowded and lively these days (I was new to the area back in July 2009 when I first visited - I guess I should be amazed that they were even still open at 9pm, at that time of the year!).    Several of the dishes are really enjoyable - the bacon / prawn dish is good, and the steamed fish with ginger is outstanding. I've started to explore a few of their \"Thai\" variants, and they seem to be doing a good job of those.  I love the fact that the place is always busy and lively (though the acoustics are a bit challenging, with shiny concrete floor, glass walls, hard-wooden chairs, etc - some hanging fabrics would help I'm sure ... )."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best here! Appetizers are 1/2 price,  the portions are huge, and the staff is really great!  I love that they have a lot of gluten free options too.  The salt and pepper wings and the chicken lettuce wraps are my favs!"}
{"text":"I've been to Flo's multiple times and not had a super positive experience.  I ordered the \"spicy thai coconut milk soup\" assuming it was tom ka and the soup that came out was more like orange-colored hot water. No taste, no spice either. It looked akin to the plastic heatable containers of tomato soup you can buy at a grocery store. I've also ordered with brown rice before and was served white rice, which was easy to fix but in retrospect, another negative mark. I came here with my parents once and ordered hot green tea which came as a small cup (and only a small cup) and that showed up on the bill as like $2. Then the potstickers are like $5 for 4 of them and they're probably just potstickers purchased from the nearby Trader Joe's market. To be honest, the only reason why I even come here now is because someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Flo's never fails to disappoint. Very good food and great service. Probably not authentic Chinese but delicious nonetheless. You'll never leave hungry. The only drawback is the noise level. With cement floors and a wide open space, it's always noisy and not a great place to have a conversation."}
{"text":"BEWARE Vegetarians and Vegans!!  I visited Flo's for the first time today and had a bad first impression.  They have some dishes listed as vegetarian (I'm vegan), and according to the waiter.....they are NOT.  He told me the brown sauce is made with a chicken stock.....ummmmm not even close to being vegetarian, let alone vegan.  He said they could make it vegan so I trusted (scary!) that they would. So buyer beware......ask many questions and don't trust the menu labeling!"}
{"text":"A good friend recommended Flo's for the food. I'm sorry to say that we didn't get a chance to eat the food because the service was so abysmal! Maybe it was because we came towards the end of the lunch rush (1:00 pm). We were seated promptly and they asked about drinks and brought our drinks quickly. After 20 minutes no one had been around to take our order.  Even after attempting to make eye contact and flagging down our waiter, another 10  minutes came and went. We finally gave up, paid for our drinks and left. Not good."}
{"text":"While visiting Tempe we tried this place out! It was really good. The Chinese Chinese Chicken Lettuce Wraps were amazing! We had the Pork Potstickers and Shrimp Spring Rolls, the potstickers were good, We wish they were cooked a little longer. The Shrimp Spring Rolls tasted great and everything was fresh! For dinner we shared the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce with Brown Rice and it was delicious! We recieved a complementy order of the chocolate won tons for dessert due to it being our first time there. When we visit Tempe next time we will definatly be back!"}
{"text":"Flo's is more of a Chinese/Thai hybrid than straight Chinese food.  But it was fantastic regardless of what I was looking for.  Loved the atmosphere and happy hour drinks!  In my party we had the Chicken Lo Mein, Katsu Chicken, and Teryaki Chicken.  All were outstanding.  The pot stickers and fried spring rolls were excellent as well. It was a little loud at times but that worked well for us as our party was equally loud.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Really?  Ordered brown rice and was given white. When reminded them that I ordered brown rice I was told they ran out. So my husband is halfway through his meal. Why couldn't we be told it would take a little longer instead of plopping what I didn't  order on my plate.  Bad service and no offer to comp meal that was delivered late.  Food is good but that's crappy customer service in my book."}
{"text":"Excellent hot and sour soup - probably one of the better ones ive ever had. very flavorful and not sloppy. my entree was OK not the greatest, but man that soup..."}
{"text":"Flo's is awesome and always yummy. They start you with a salad with an amazing dressing and all the entrees I've had rock! If you like spicy order a side of there chili oil."}
{"text":"This place is always dependable.  The food is always good, the service is always a little lackluster but without blame as those guys and gals bust their backends considering how busy the place is, always and the prices are really fair, especially considering portion sizes and happy hour specials.  It's a no frills experience, you go, you wait but you wait because the food is good and fresh and doesn't leave you hungry in an hour like many other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I bring my family here for the Saturday lunch specials. The food is tasty and affordable. The wonton chips with sweet and sour and salad they bring before your meal are worth coming for alone. I've never been to China, so I don't know if this is authentic, but on the other hand, I don't care either. It tastes great."}
{"text":"We have eaten here probably 3 or 4 times now, simply for the fact that it's nearby and easy to get, but we must say the food quality here is pretty low, the flavors are very hit or miss (mostly miss), and the prices they're charging for this mediocre food are way too high. We would expect to pay half as much for food this poor. We just spent $40 on a to go order for lunch and not only did they mess up our order (we think the waitress was new, she didn't know the answers to any questions on the phone), but about 3/4 of our food was nearly inedible... it was just plain gross. Just a waste, we threw it out after a few bites. Suffice to say, I don't think we'll come back again."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around.  Great Hot and Sour Soup, Shrimp Skewers, Kung Pao Scallops, it is is all yummy!"}
{"text":"This place was okay as far as casual atmosphere goes, not a place to dress up for. It reminds me of something between a cafeteria and a cafe, nothing spectacular. But if you want a quick bite to Easter i guessed it was more of a casual cafe."}
{"text":"Flo's is good for service and their prices! They have a great happy hour and $5 lunch on Saturdays! They have an expansive menu with a fantastic variety of Asian food choices, but the quality of the food is CONSISTENTLY INCONSISTENT!   Two times the food has been great and 3 times so, so! Last time had Shrimp Pad Thai and the noodles were so mushy! Had Dan Dan noodles another time and they were great! Have had the green curry chicken twice and once it was good and the other time not. I am not sure if they have better cooks at one time than another.  Good prices and service means I'll give it another try but I sure wish they would get it together for good food EVERY visit!"}
{"text":"The food and service was pretty good.  The building  use to be a McDonalds years ago but Flo's has remodeled it so well you could never tell.  If i am in the area I would eat here again but otherwise I  wouldn't go outta my way to drive to Flo's when there are so many other options."}
{"text":"June 25.  Waitress was not rude but aloof. Gave us dish w/small portions of lime for our water/tea. I complained that they were dried out/no juice and she whisked the dish away and brought back more that were the same.  My wife order an appetizer that was dried out and not fit to eat. She abruptly took the dish, with no comment and credited our  bill with 33% of the cost of the item. Again no comment.  They closed all the blinds (understandable) but without proper lighting the place was so dark it was hard to see your food.  Noise level is unbelievable . I over tipped according to the service received.  The waitress could have used some training on customer relationship."}
{"text":"Flo's has great food and great service.  Plus they are right across the street from Doc and Eddy's Bar."}
{"text":"There seems to be a. \"Click\" that hangs at the bar . So if ur not part of it u r basically ignored by the bartender . Not hating just saying don't sit at the bar if ur not a regular"}
{"text":"without a doubt, the best around. happy hour. excellent, my favorites is the calamari and the chicken wings, a must have..and everything else excellent. I try and make it thier at least twice a month ..half price on appitizers and drinks from 3-7, did i say happy hour..m-f.."}
{"text":"Last night it was our first time here.we went there after following good reviews.but what a disappointment. We ordered hot and sour soup, shrimp and egg noodles, Kung pao chicken, red curry chicken. No doubt soup was good.but red curry and kung pao was a total fail.i don't know why the curry called red curry.coz not even the colour was red.forget about the taste.there was a burnt flavor in kung pao.anyhow I didn't like it at all.never going back there."}
{"text":"Great stuff, we went during happy hour.  I couldn't believe the prices at the end of the day.  The only problem was the salt and pepper chicken didn't have any salt.  Probably some snowbird complained that all the salt would raise his blood pressure.  $25 for two of us, both are over stuffed, and not oiled out. I am going back for sure.   Also I saw Flo."}
{"text":"Flo's is pretty good. They have an incredible Saturday lunch special... 5 Bucks! Can't beat that! It gets very crowded on Saturdays, so it's best to go early or late for that lunch special. I guess it's just a strange pet peeve of mine, but it's really loud in this place. Every other sentence, and I am leaning over and yelling WWWWWHAT? to my wife! It annoys me to go there, despite the food being pretty good. I like their lettuce wraps, and the curry chicken dishes are good as well. They serve a great little salad with entrees too, with a delicious house dressing."}
{"text":"Kids meals were disappointing.  Terriyaki chicken is a basic kid meal staple but Flos kid meals only include rice.  If you want noodles instead with the Terriyaki meal it costs extra $2.  That's $7.50 for kids terriyaki with noodles.  Pei Wei much better and more flexible with pricing."}
{"text":"The  food was reasonably priced and they are very accommodating to vegitarian but the four dishes we ordered were a bit bland. The atmosphere is awesome and we are planning to try it again to seen if they had an off night"}
{"text":"Flo's was pretty goodies.  We were recommended to go there by the concierge at the place we stayed who said they had the BEST won tons in the universe.  False.  Still, good all around place that was basically empty when we showed up on a Tuesday night.  Reasonable prices and competent service."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot. Very good. All menu items are homemade and taste fresh. Not cheap but I think well worth it."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to this restaurant, based on a recommendation from a bartender in the Grand Canyon.  Unfortunately, after reading the great reviews about the food and the service, this experience really ruined my last night in Scottsdale.  We ordered a crab delight appetizer and the crust was chewy & heavy, instead of light and crisp, which took awhile to arrive.  Fifteen minutes later we were brough the Spicy Thai soup, which wasn't great, yet the best dish we had.  Sitting at the table, being ingnored/forgotten, after we were asked if we wanted the soup boxed up, we sat comtemplating leaving before the rest of our food arrived.  I told my boyfriend that a gal had come (who wasn't our server) asking if everything was okay and I told her we were waiting on 3 dishes and it had been awhile.  He told me he already watched the people who came in behind us eat and leave.    Our server then glanced our way and made a comment under her breath - 'no food?'.  About another ten minutes, two of our dishes arrived by the hands of someone else.  The cashew chicken was okay, the Mongolian beef was unedible and the lemon chicken tasted like you could get it from a grocery store.  All I can say for the good reviews if that these people must not have exposure to much Asian foods.  We are from Seattle, where there is a huge Asian influence on the palette.  So, if your city is known for Asian food, I recommend skiping this place, if not, you might like it.  However, the poor service was inexcusable and they didn't even apologize for the hour+ wait in a non-crowded restaurant!"}
{"text":"I read all of the Yelp reviews and remember Flo's being very good at the Scottsdale location years ago. Ordered combination fried rice and Mongolian beef. I was stunned to see the  \"fried rice\" it was the most disgusting, bland, nothing 'fried' about this dish. Just awful.  The Mongolian beef was ok but more onions than beef. $30 total wasted. NEVER AGAIN, we threw the fried rice out as we could not eat it (was take-out) it was THAT BAD."}
{"text":"We just got back from lunch at Flo's! I am surprised it was not busier but we did go at 11 AM so maybe we beat the crowd. I had the lemon sauce chicken and the sauce was nice and sweet and the chicken was thin and crispy which is exactly how I like it! The lunch comes with a side salad first with their yummy dressing. We are going to add Flo's to our lunch options for sure!"}
{"text":"My original review was three stars, see below, but after the owner sent me a message berating me because of my review I decided to downgrade my review to a two. I felt it was a fair honest review. He actually told me I'd be better off at Panda Express, well if that's what you feel your food is compared to I feel bad for you. I feel your food was much better than Panda Express.     Nice decor. The food was decent, similar to a PF Changs. Servings were good sized and affordable. I had the sweet and sour chicken, spring rolls and pot stickers. All were good. But not out of this world"}
{"text":"Flo's is good, not great. Killer lunch specials on Saturdays, 5 bucks. It's loud in there, and the service is OK. Can't get too excited about this place, but it is right around the corner from where we live, the only bonus for me."}
{"text":"Visited the place many times. The food is great. Some dishes are fantastic. Price is reasonable. Very good lunch deal. The place is noisy, but the food and service are great."}
{"text":"I love Flo's! I'm so happy this restaurant has finally made its way to Tempe... So delicious.  And a really really..... REALLY good happy hour menu.  Half off all drinks and great appetizer specials.  The food is just as amazing as the other locations.  My favorite is the Mongolian Beef, but the bartender introduced me to the salt and pepper wings which might be my new obsession.  This place is brand new so expect some slight hiccups, but he final product is always is delicious!!!   I  heart Flo's!!!"}
{"text":"So sad that the chicken satay..a main staple was removed from the menu. The main reason I came to flos. :("}
{"text":"Walked in and very surprise with music and atmosphere not good and noise. Very bland food with no salt nor peppers on table. All come with salad that i was ready to ask if it was bagged. Employee not very happy to be there and not knowledgeable on food. Please don't waist the money, i had better at a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"We love Flos. Happy hour has the best Beers and Happy Hour Menu is soo good. Dinner menu is Awesomely Delicious. Service is very very good and friendly. Can't beat this place. Luv Mary&Carl"}
{"text":"This food is terrible. The hostesses are hot, but the food tastes like one of those $4.95 all you can eat Chinese buffets. Seriously, the Emperor has no clothes. It sucks."}
{"text":"In town for the week, was craving Chinese food and found Flo's not too far from our resort. We were initially shocked at how busy it was for a Wednesday night but we were happily seated right away. We decided on sharing the orange chicken and Mongolian beef with crab wontons to start. The wontons came only a few minutes later and were delicious! Our food followed VERY shortly after. Our food was AMAZING! Probably the best Chinese food we have had. The portions were huge, which we of course at at home later that night. The service was very fast and friendly, Emmi was a great server! Would recommend if you are in the area, all around a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"For the past 10 years I've been ordering the Yellow curry chicken dish. I love it so much. Now I even have my father in love with this restaurant and dish.  If you're looking for proper Asian food go to Flo's."}
{"text":"Ok food, not much better than PF Changs. Some unique dishes but not great and not very authentic. The crispy and spicy chicken was good though."}
{"text":"While the waiter was attentive, the food was so salty, it was inedible. Huge waste of money. I ate 3 pieces of the edamame after having had to wipe the heavy salt off of each. Had about 4 bites of the Hot & Sour soup - way too salty, as well. Very disappointing. Should have asked for a discount, or should have been offered one, but no."}
{"text":"Love all of the food at Flo's! They have a very large menu from many different Asian countries and it was hard to chose everything sounded so amazing!  I ordered the Dan Dan noodles and they were perfect! The food and drinks came out quickly and the noodles and chicken were fresh and delicious 10/10 experience.  The two hostesses Kristen and Katrina were very very nice and friendly and my server Tony was excellent and very funny! Love this place :))))"}
{"text":"One of the restaurants in the valley that I stop by to frequently. Great prices, great service and always awesome food. Being that Flo's started in Arizona, I love it that much more! Crab Wantons & Southeast Asian Peanut Chicken"}
{"text":"I've been to Flo's numerous times over the years, but there seems to be a downward trend.  It looks like I'll be finding a new Asian Fusion spot...  The Man and I had a couple hours to kill and hungry bellies to feed, so we popped into Flo's for their (seemingly) amazing happy hour.  I ordered a froo-froo drink, which I'm pretty sure was half-price because it contained half the alcohol it normally does.  Tasty, but strong? Um, no.  We moved on to a bunch of appetizers: crab puffs, chicken satay, spring rolls, BBQ pork, and pot stickers.  The BBQ pork was yummy, but that is where our satisfaction ended.  All of the other items seemed no better than from-the-freezer snacks I can get at the grocery store.  Are they making any of these on site?  Maybe, but it sure didn't taste like it.  The crab puffs were the most disappointing.  So little crab, so much cream cheese.  They should definitely take a look at that ratio and either rename the dish or up the crab quantity.  Just a thought...  Now I'm off on a journey for a new go-to Asian spot!"}
{"text":"Terrible! The expensive calamari was so chewy I couldn't even get through a single piece, the chicken was unbelievably dry and the sauce that came with it made my stomach hurt, and the pot stickers tasted like they were frozen out of a box (soft and bland). Never eating here again!"}
{"text":"Bad ambience. The food was a disaster. Wonton soup was water and uncooked wontons. Red curry came without the rice. The only food I enjoyed was the lettuce wraps.  Never again."}
{"text":"My \"go to\" Chinese joint in North Scottsdale although my favorite dish is not Chinese! The Thai Tom Yum is as good as you can get and for only $6, an unheard of bargin with lots of big yummy  shrimp. My wife swears by the Sizzling Rice Soup and my teenage sons love EVERYTHING but especially the Katsu Chicken and of course Spring Rolls and anything Wontoned...   Be sure to get an Oder of Flo's Special Fly Rice, it has all the proteins in it including the kind that quacks before it finds it's way into the wok!  Xie Xie (sheh sheh)"}
{"text":"The best burritos I ever have in around this area and it is very closed to where I worked that I can pick up my lunch in a few minutes. I came here sometimes and planned come back sometime in the near future! More I can say that I truly recommended!"}
{"text":"New location opened in Tempe at Rural and Baseline, its actually located in a former McD's but you wouldn't know it by walking inside. They have a nice long bar area and the dining area is large and open. The menu is huge and varies between chinese, thai and other asian fusion.  They have lettuce wraps that are delicious and the Pad Thai, Pork Lo Mein and Shrimp in Lobster sauce are all good choices.  Go in for Happy Hour or on Saturdays when the menu is $6 from noon - 3!  Such a deal."}
{"text":"I have been going to Flo's for years and every single time it is AMAZING! Whenever I have family or friends in town I always take them here and nobody is every disappointed. Not only is the food exceptional so is the customer service. Flo herself stops at every table and ask how your meal was... I seriously don't understand how every single time I have been there in all times of the day she has done this. By far one of my favorite places in AZ."}
{"text":"Another random stop for lunch last week and this place was pretty crowded around 1pm on a weekday, but we got seated right away. The first mistake was being served salad as the opening course. Even though the peanut dressing was really good, no asian restaurant worth its merit should be dishing out iceberg salad. They need to do the traditional cup of soup or eggroll for us to get the full experience. Most lunch dishes are around $9 or $10 and I had the lemon chicken. Pretty simple and tasty. Panko breaded chicken strips with a lemon dipping sauce, white rice and a few wontons. I got soy issues, so my Chinese experience is boring, but still a good dish."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner in April 2011. The dishes are hit and miss, and all are over priced. My wife ordered pad thai, and it was horrible. Instead of the traditional, flavorful dish with peanut and bean sprout, this dish at Flo's is just a salty, chicken noodle. My wife and I both took a bite, we had to send it back. It was not edible. Too salty. Only chicken and rice noodle. There was no peanut, no bean sprout, no pepper, no egg, no ..... Basically, it was NOT a pad thai at all.   On the upside, my son ordered a sweet&sour chicken, and it was better than most places. They used fresh pineapples.  Based on food quality, ambience, and dinner prices, I say there are tons of other places that are better."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I went to Flo's with my family tonight and will not be back. The Basil Chicken entree had two pieces of basil and the cheapest chicken imaginable. My meal was cold while my husband's was steaming ?!?   The service- The waiter took 10 minutes to greet us. We quickly ordered and he never once came back to see how anything tasted. Towards the end of the meal he finally returned to our table to hand us the check... Ha!   Not worth the money. Not worth my time. I probably could have eaten better and cheaper at a Chinese takeout fast food place. Gross."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: My sister used to work here, so I have eaten my fair share of free food from this place, allowing me to taste more or less everything.  Flo's has some of the best hot and sour soup I have ever had.  It is so good, it is a bad thing because I cannot eat it anywhere else without being disappointed.  Really.  The food is all pretty good, nothing outstanding, nothing terrible.  I try and mix it up every time, so there is nothing that I prefer over anything else.  Take a stab at any thing.  The happy hour here and at all Flo's places is pretty sweet, 1/2 off all appetizers, table or bar, and same with drinks.  It is hard to beat.  The restrooms are nice private stalls, clean and stocked.  4 Flushes."}
{"text":"What is not to LOVE about Flo's.  I haven't eaten here in years and it was just as great as I remembered.   I am from New Orleans and their shrimp rivals the fresh gulf shrimp that I grew up on.  I had the seafood soup and it was delicious and full of shrimp and scallops.   My meal was only $11.00 and I have leftovers for tomorrow night.   The hot and sour soup was also amazing and I hear their beef and noodle soup is delicious.   I am here for a month and will be eating here a lot.   I can't even make dinner at home for less than that."}
{"text":"Three stars for any Chinese restaurant in the area is really good. There aren't many options, and most are meh. We went in time for Happy Hour (before 7:00) at the FLW location and it was packed and extremely LOUD. We were seated within 10 minutes and staff was very pleasant and helpful. Spicy lettuce wraps were tasty as were chicken wings. App portions are very large, so we enjoyed them the next day. I had chicken in Cantonese sauce--very different than I'm used to, but tasty. Hubby didn't love his pepper chicken and will try something else next time. Might try Promenade location next time as waitress said it's a bit quieter. Overall, it was decent Chinese and will go again. Portions are generous."}
{"text":"You know it's not authentic when they give your party forks instead of chopsticks, lol.  To their credit, the food wasn't terrible tasting... but it's whitewashed Chinese food. And not GOOD Americanized-style Chinese food (think Panda Express - greasy and yummy, Americanized) but rather... just... very bland \"Chinese\" food.  The venue itself is super clean and nice, and the servers are lovely people.  Go here if you are too nervous to try authentic Chinese food but want to feel multicultural for a day. Don't worry, they won't give you chopsticks unless you ask."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was more of a community effort.  We had an issue with the food, more of a personal preference, and it was resolved quickly.  Would have liked more attention from our designated server. Will eat here again.  The business should close up the south end of the patio to hide/quiet the Baseline road noise and lights coming into the parking lot."}
{"text":"Damn good Chinese food! Nothing much else to say"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with my first trip here. I usually go to the one on Thompson Peak and I was expecting similar food quality, needless to say I am surprised. The chicken is like chewing on leather, the portion size is smaller, and there was barely any sauce. Staff was friendly, but the food is overall bad. I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I recently became Pescatarian, but REALLY love Asian food. It's basically a guilty pleasure. So when we walked in and smelled the amazing Flo's smells, I almost died. Our server, a tall blonde man was great with getting us beers and waters, and made sure to help me find the right dish -- Sweet and Sour Tofu with white rice. and it was DELICIOUS. The atmosphere in the Tempe Flo's is great too. We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Good service. Nice restaurant. The food is not very good though. At least what I ordered. I ordered Kung Pao Chicken. It came out too quick. You could tell that it was processed pre-cooked chicken that they just flash fried really quick. Very fatty not good quality chicken at all.  Will try this place one more time or another dish but if it's the same quality I will be not back again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the menu and all the wonderful options and tastes.   For example, by offering (and mentioning it in the menu) the flexibility to substitute tofu in any dish, it opens up endless possibilities not offered in most other Asian restaurants.    The last few times I have subbed in the rather unhealthy yet tasty fried tofu in the pan fried noodle and beef and broccoli dishes.   As a bonus, they even reduce the price when  replacing meat with tofu.     Here's where Flo's needs improvement.   First, the service has been very very slow the last few times I've been there.  I don't know  what the holdup is as there appears to be plenty of staff present.   Perhaps the staff needs additional training.  Second, the food has come out warm, not hot.   Could be the slow staff leaves food sitting under the warmers getting cold.     Overall a great place and worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The only thing I would change in this restaurant would be adding booths . I think it would add a more warm and comfortable feeling .   The service was great for lunch . We absolutely loved the egg drop soup ! My husband love the fried rice and he keeps talking about going back for it lol!  I really liked how clean the bathrooms were. The bar was very nicely set up .  I can not wait to try more food !"}
{"text":"I've been obsessed with Flo's for years and have never had any issues until recently. I so want to leave more stars but I've been dissatisfied the last 4 or 5 times.  - there has been a mistake in my take out orders 3 out of 5 times. The hostesses sound 15 yrs old and rush the call resulting in errors with my food that I can't send back bc I'm already home  - the portion size has dramatically downsized. I asked the waitress last time I ate there and she said \"yes, there have been a few changes\"  Now, instead of getting a basket of won ton chips on the table, their new technique is to put a pile of them on one side of the entree plate so they take up space so people hopefully won't notice the skimpy portion size. I'm an average person and don't overheat, but for these prices, the amount is very skimpy  - lastly, flo has raised her prices to the point of being absurd. Maybe her locations cause her to think all her customers are rich, but I seriously can't afford to get take out anymore. Tonight I ordered 3 basic dishes for my daughter and I and it was $40 before tip.  The average dish is $12-14 which is ridiculous. Most other restaurants are $8-11. I noticed tonight the lack of flavor in the lo mein and the small number of cashews in my cashew chicken.   The sad thing is, good chinese is so hard to find in Phoenix, but that doesn't give Flo's the right to take advantage of that fact.  2 years I wouldn't have complained but now I'm in search of a new obsession"}
{"text":"Guy has been busing tables, wiping tables with nasty rag that has not been rinsed, sweeping floors and picking up stuff off floor, then proceeds to set fresh dishes and silverware, bring out ' clean' bar glasses, refilling glasses, etc, etc and hasn't ever washed his hands. Just took my daughters glass, refilled it and put a straw in - stirred the drink with the straw by holding the top of the straw, handed it back. Daughter is so grossed out. Along with rest of ppl at table. Wash your hands. Simple thing. Have watched him for another 20 min. Still hasn't washed Last thing he asked our table if he could box up leftovers. A big 'no!' From everyone at table.   Good food, good service. All ruined by somebody not being clean."}
{"text":"This location has been horrible, the other locations have been great. Since this location is near my house, I still for some reason due take out a couple times a year. MY MISTAKE, I ordered tonight and I always inform the CSR to place notes on my order to please make everything fresh as It is not always fresh from the past. Well, I picked my order up and sure as can be the spring rolls and crab puffs were cold, I informed the manager and he said hold on a minutes and took the two items back. He came out and said, \"here they are fresh straight from the oil\" Well, I got home and I was shocked the store manager would take the original items and toss them back in the oil and not even have the professional solution by making the complete order over, how do I know, both the items were burnt. Very obvious they were reheated in oil. I took pictures, but do not see a place on yelp to upload.  This is not cheap drive-through, and as a store manager he should of made it right, I am ashamed that customer service is coming to this."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and always enjoy my experience here. It's a great place to bring guests to enjoy great quality Chinese dishes. Also they have the best happy hour! 3-7 everyday!! half of their drinks and appetizers! Their appetizers are so good! My family loves them, the crab puffs are so good with the sweet and sour sauce (the best sweet sour sauce I've ever had), shrimp skewers gotta be my favorite! The shrimp is so juicy and the peanut sauce is such a nice pairing! My parents love coming here, their pricing also is so affordable!   They have this lunch specials on Saturdays, anything that you can order in a lunch portion, is 5 dollars! Also comes with a side of rice, a side of salad with their amazing dressing!! and side of those yummy WT chips with the sweet sour sauces! The service has always been excellent, Flo's got the best crew! They made sure that everything is excellent and the owner and managers are friendly and helpful too! All of their dishes are so good, this is by far the best Chinese restaurant in America. You can do take outs too!   I first came about 4 years ago with my family, and we were hooked! The kids always loves the sweet and sour chicken, and the chocolate won tons! right now I'm definitely in love with their cashew chicken! they have a great vegetarian menu too, and you can ask to have your food gluten free! I took one of my friend to try out the happy our there and she fell in love with the spring roll and also thought that the staff are all really good looking LOL.   Over all, this place is definitely worth the visit, and it's a great experience. It's affordable, great quality, very customer friendly and definitely my favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants to go to... we are regulars here.  Great food, awesome happy hour and wonderful staff especially Jeanne (the manager) and long time wait staff like Dony, Nikki and Mike."}
{"text":"Great food, nice environment, service mediocre. Can't believe this used to be McDonald's!!"}
{"text":"great food great service but the fortune in my fortune cookie were the same as my friend .....   this place is a scam!!!   never coming back again because of the fortune cookie incident.    it broke my heart."}
{"text":"My friend at work just loves this place.  I'm not blown away by Flo's but it isn't bad.  The salad dressing is wonderful, and I wish I could buy it by the bottle.   The food isn't spectacular (though I will admit I am not always adventurous when it comes to Chinese food)   The service is usually pretty good, though this last time, I think the gentleman was new because he was ALL over us, and then we didn't see him again for nearly 30 minutes. But I'm sure once he's more comfortable he'll be a great addition."}
{"text":"basically az's pf changs or whatever  you want to call it ... the food isn't all that wondeful but what am i supposed to say? this is probably one of the higher end places arizona has to offer ...   service was decent. prices are appropriate, $7 an entree?  if you want chinese food in scottsdale, flo isn't a bad place but i would rather save my appetite for something better ...  meaning, id rather go elsewhere (not a restaurant) but grub on some homemade chinese food which is normally the way i like to eat my chinese food. *shrugs*"}
{"text":"I have never had such service that I had to let others know about it.Yesterday was Valentine's Day and so we decided we were going to order take out and have a family night. We choose Flo's  in Tempe because an individual recommend it said he goes there for lunch all the time and  said it's fantastic. I wish I could have received the same service he gets at lunch time. So I call to order take out and the young lady answers and asks if she could put me on a brief hold sure I said knowing it's a busy day of the year so it was a little bit of time that I held probably 3 minutes or so and she comes on I tell her I would like to order take out coconut soup,pot stickers, wings,crab puffs and pepper bacon shrimp she kept correcting me chicken bacon I'm  like no my husband seen it on your menu then she finds it tells me the keys on system are always moving ok whatever 58.00 I seen on the website 50% off most appetizers and drinks ( doesn't say in house) you should probably put which ones are so people can see them. But was in shock I thanked her and hung up  omg I was thinking I text my husband to tell him how much  because he was on his way. He asks WTH did you order I'm thinking regular Chinese food appetizers  and though one might at least be half off. then I called back I asked the woman to remove coconut soup and she  very abruptly say I will and hangs up the phone(rude) so my husband proceeds to get home we sit down to eat and I was shocked this food was like nothing we expected at all the only thing half decent was the crab puffs because they weren't soggy and for 7.50 and only 6 in the bag the wings had a good flavor very scary looking because they put crispy wings on a plastic container that's not a good move and that was 12.95  wasn't a dozen  which I was shocked for that price and ordered the pot stickers they were gummy as if they were not cooked fully and they were pork so didn't want to take a chance getting food poison, my poor husband after working all day gets a container of soggy bacon what looked like Roma tomatoes soggy and it had 4 shrimp in it. Our Valentine's Day was to focus on each other and express the love we have for each other  instead we didn't eat much of this very over priced meal. To top it all off in conversation about how mad at ourselves we were for getting food from there. My husband says you didn't get your coconut soup I said I know I called and cancelled he said they still charged me for it I called and explained to them what happened there was not a sympathetic answer given basically it was 20 questions I was asked was it a man or woman that checked you out? Do you happen to know their name? My favorite one was are you sure you didn't get it? Then she puts me on hold and a man picks up ( please let your customers know that they will be transferred) I said do you know why I'm calling ?he said yes and then told me what I can do is give you store credit we have a book here with the names in it ( I had to chuckle because I understood after what I was served I understood why)or I can void your transaction and I'll need to take your credit card over the phone with the 8.50 plus tax taken off . We chose the void. He says I do see a 10.00 tip should we keep or remove that no keep it I stated it's Valentine's Day so he then tells me what my total is charges the cards I still have not received a sympathetic response even from the manager. I will never eat nor recommend this place and I will be telling my close friend that frequents there today when I get to work. I have been in the service industry for years my recommendations  are: 1. You should never make any customer feel like your to busy to assist or take care of them and not a good idea to the game clue when a customer said they didn't receive something. 2. You should probably reevaluate the container you use for hot food because as cost effective as they may be that alone will loose you business nobody should be subjected to pay high prices for soggy food 3. You should put quantities on your menu so people know what they are getting for that price 4.If the roles where changed I may have \"apologized\" for the level of service along with asked how everything else was and more then likely being it was one of the busiest days of the year would have at least gave 50% off the meal to encourage return business . 5. Know what goes out of your restaurant should always be known for quality not quantity. I would never tell no one to eat at flo's because that is just not me but I wanted to share my service with you as a first time guest. Thank you"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years now and it got really big since they opened. Sadly, it lost a little in food quality over time and for some reason I always seem to have stomach issues that I don't get at any other Asian eateries. They might be cooking with MSG, I am not sure since my wife does not seem to have any problems with the food. Waiting time can be very long depending when you want to eat so I usually just order it as a take out since we live near by. It's best to call ahead to get a feel for how busy they are. I am also discouraged by the inconsistency of the food quality, while sometimes the egg drop or wonton soups are awesome, they are bland and tasteless at other times. So I give it 3 stars which seems fair But I would rate it 3 1/2 stars if Yelp would allow half points."}
{"text":"I've giving them 3 stars instead of 4 based on lack of parking. It's absolutely ridiculous. There's no 10 min parking for takeout, be prepared to walk a couple hundred feet. Once your inside it's great. I've been here at least a half dozen times. It's always packed. The food doesn't blow your mind but it's predictably good.   The kong poa & orange chicken are my favorites."}
{"text":"My first time with a friend. Just OK, nothing special. Ordered crispy fried beef and Mongolian beef. Portion at lunch was generous, served with a small salad and lots of ordinary brown rice. Waitress friendly but after the meal came, not seen again. Probably won't return as we prefer at least 3 other Asian places."}
{"text":"I do like flo's Chinese food. But it can be hit or miss sometimes. I always get their pho soup. Usually very flavorful. My husband likes to get their eggrolls, chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"Love, Love Love this place for happy hour. 1/2 price drinks and appetizers and the food is great. We always come with a big group and the service is always very good. There's a good size patio to be able to eat outside also. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place for so many reasons. The foods great and it never disappoints. I only go for lunch but I hear the happy hour is great as well. It's priced right. I can't get a better value for my money. What I love the most is the service. I'm a nobody but when I go in there they make me feel important. I always sit at the bar and although I may only go in a couple times a month, the bartender knows my name, order, and modifications. The manager has randomly comped my meal just out of appreciation for my business. I don't write reviews but these folks have it figured out and other people need to know they are doing it right. I'll be forever loyal to this Flo's. They truly inspire me to be better to people."}
{"text":"Good stuff...been to the one Scottsdale several times and always enjoyed...glad they brought one to the SE valley. For apps, we orders the spring rolls and the pork dumplings.  The I'm in love with the egg rolls at PF Changs and these don't really measure up...sorry! The dumplings were amazing.  They are steamed and we had them done a bit crispy.  They were a perfect combination of steamed and lightly pan friend!  Amazing!! We went with the classic Cashew Chicken and the kids Sweet & Sour Chicken.  Both were great.  I love this place!  We passed on desert so no review there."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good but didn't stand out significantly. The ambience was okay but the lighting was too dim. My mom had to use her flashlight on her phone to see the menu. Our server seemed a little overwhelmed and was taking on quite a few tables by herself. I ordered chicken fried rice but again- it didn't stand out and didn't have a lot of flavor. I might try this place out again for happy hour."}
{"text":"We have been looking for our go-to Chinese restaurant in the valley and now have found it. For dinner we had a bowl of Wonton soup and a black bean beef entree. The wonton soup was delicious and filling with homemade wontons. The black bean beef was a special order that they  graciously made for us. Service was attentive. Only ding is the black bean beef could have been a little hotter when it made it out.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went there for an early dinner today and the good and the service was excellent.  Very clean and sparkling.  Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience ever, i will never come back to this place , the food was decent it took about 40 min to get our food out , we saw our server maybe 3 when we needed something we always had to ask , the managet was this blond girl that was just hanging out in the host stand doing nothing not helping her staff , they had maybe 4 servers for the whole restaurant and they had a wait list , i blame her for the bad planning and not helping her team . Dont waste your time at this place very disappointed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I eat here about once a week!! Love this place! We always sit at the bar, because Katie always treats us well, and she really knows what to suggest, when we want to try something new! She always welcomes us with a big smile...and has taken time to get to know us, as regulars!  Best service EVER!! Food is always good...but Katie is the real reason we go back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Opened at 3pm on Christmas Day and the crowd was pouring in before then.    The hot and sour soup was the freshest I ever had, and was gigantic.  Everything was freshly made with good ingredients.  Friendly service.    The Spicy Ginger & Onion Beef, along with the special spicy fried rice was delicious even when reheated as leftovers."}
{"text":"Love their lunch here. It's an excellent value. You get crispy won ton's, salad, and an entree for $7-$9. It's quite a bit of food so I always take some left overs back with me.   However, it is always really loud an crowed here. Parking can also be a nightmare in this lot. It's a small shopping center with a couple of popular stores/restaurants (well it doesn't look like there's much else but apaprtments/condos/houses in this immediate area) and minimal parking.    And it's pointless to make reservations here for large groups here. We've had issues a couple of times. Most recently we had a business lunch here a few weeks ago and called and confirmed our party of 14 twice and when we got there on the day of our reservations they acted completely clueless. And because it was during a busy lunch time it took them awhile to get some tables together to seat us."}
{"text":"Flo's Flo's Flo's!  Anyone in the general vicinity of Scottsdale Rd and FLW who is searching for great Asian fare, your journey is over.  For great dine in or take out eat Flo's...period."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great happy hour spot,  Flo is your girl. She has 50% drinks AND appetizers till 7. If you're a wino like my bestie and me go for the whole bottle. We have been on the look out for new happy hour joints for years but always come back to Flos. When you can do a tangy bottle of white wine, spicy lettuce cups and crispy spring rolls for a great price it's hard to justify going anywhere else in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"So, the first thing you should know is, slow service.  The theme of the evening was hearing the staff say \"let me check on that, it should be ready by now\" or \"I'm sorry your order is taking so long\". Not a good sign and if I had been paying attention when my daughter and I walked in for our first experience here I would have turned around and left.  We were there for TWO hours for what essentially was mediocre Chinese.  Not bad but not good either and particularly not worth the time invested.  Even the people waiting for take out were having to wait a long time, the problem is the kitchen.  Figure it out.  The only thing was by the time we got our food the manager ended up comping our meal and all I did was tip the poor waitress.  She was good and pleasant under the extremely stressful situation of having incompetent kitchen staff service her customers .  I won't be back and you should avoid this place."}
{"text":"Good food good service only reason i didnt give 5 star was because its way too loud.  Def would come again"}
{"text":"Situated in north Scottsdale, it's a gem to discover. With its small bar and dinning areas, this place really impressed me. All staff were so friendly and patient to this newbie. I ate at the bar and the barista was perky and jolly... A breathe of fresh air on an overcasted Sunday evening. It's not really a \"full\" bar, but it will get you through. The place was clean and very coordinated with its orange, black, and white color scheme. Very calm, relaxing atmosphere.   The menu is lengthy compared to other Thai restaurants. They are sure to have your dish. I ordered the hot and sour soup for starters. The dish was delivered very promptly. It was so hearty and plentiful, that I didn't order a main dish. AND I took half the soup to-go!   The only negative: I didn't get ONE napkin during this whole experience. Seeming that the soup comes with a spoon, I guess it wasn't necessary to give me the utensils wrapped in a napkin. No biggy. I'll return again... and demand a napkin! ;-)"}
{"text":"Diverse menu. Food usually pretty good. Great happy hour prices. Decent beverage selection by Chinese restaurant standards. We have had good service when we have gone.Easy parking. In a shopping center but don't let it discourage you.  This is part of a small chain and they all seem to be good."}
{"text":"My kids actually eat here! They love the teriyaki chicken. Love the shrimp and bacon dish! And Pomarita-Florita. Eat here regularly. Service is great."}
{"text":"Really good food and a friendly staff makes this a great place to visit.  I have been several times, if you like spicy the spicy ginger beef is my favorite by far.  They have a wonderfully priced lunch menu.  My two daughters, aged 8 and 5 love the kids honey chicken.  It is our go to spot when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Flo's was a great dining experience. They serve a full-course meal that will definitely satisfy. The menu is huge, but everyone was satisfied with what they ordered! The building is recently renovated so it is very nice and clean inside. I recommend the pad Thai!"}
{"text":"We popped in here after the Phoenix Open for some dinner because they were on our Elite AZ restaurant list! Since we don't make it up this way very often, we figured that we might as well take advantage!  We started with vegetarian spring rolls and they were good, not great. My husband and I got in a little debate because he ordered them while I was in the restroom and chose vegetarian instead of chicken but vegetarian spring rolls are always warm, mushy veggies! Not my thang.  Anywho! The entrees were EXCELLENT! I ordered the beef and broccoli with wide noodles and oh my goodness, these were HEAVEN. I would 100% recommend them over just basic beef and broccoli. The sauce and noodles were dreamy. Next, we split the orange chicken and that too, was tasty! The meat was good quality white meat! Yay! I'm not a fan of dark meat so this made my happy. We ordered white rice to go along with it. Both portion sizes were HUGE!!! We were both pretty hungry and my husband can eat A LOT (it is super rare for us to take home leftovers) and we had a good amount of both leftover! Yay! Always a plus!   All in all, the food was fresh and tasty! They were super busy for a Thursday evening which was noticed in the service because it was a bit slow (we waited forever for our check). But oh well! We were full and happy. The portion sizes were huge and the menu is very well priced. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always been a Flos fan, it's been a family favorite since my siblings served there! I loved the ginger beef, comfortable environment, always kind of cold. They do have a bar that's separate from the dining area! Great service."}
{"text":"Best happy hour ever!   The following have been tried and are delicious:  salt and pepper chicken wings, edamame, crab puffs, hot and sour soup, sizzling rice soup, basil thai chicken.  All bartenders are fantastic.  Good selection of wine.  Only reason for 4 stars is their desserts (only 3 available) are terrible."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just stumbled upon this place tonight and we enjoyed it so much I felt compelled to review.  The food was delicious, fresh, and filling! The staff was great, along with the atmosphere.  Definitely would go back again! Also, for vegans, or gluten free, etc. it is easily specified what it contains as far as allergies on the menu. No matter what your needs, Flo's has many options for all which makes choosing a great dish for everyone fun and easy- just wonderful :)"}
{"text":"Flo's Asian has finally made it to Tempe! We have been fans of \"Flo's of Scottsdale\" since she opened her 1st restaurant in Scottsdale! So it's great they're open now in the heart of Tempe, at Baseline & Rural Rd. Great Interior Design...such a nice, bright open feel! We had excellent service and the food did not disappoint!  We started off with  1/2 price appetizers, Crab Puffs & Spicy Wontons.  (Happy Hr. is every day from 3-7pm with 1/2 price DRINKS also!)  For the main course, I got the Cashew Chicken and my partner got the Kung Pao Chicken. All were as delicious as we remembered! At the end of our dinner, Flo herself came out to the table to check on us & thank us and wished me a Happy Birthday! We topped off the delicious meal with complimentary \"scrumptious\" Chocolate Won tons!  We'll be back for sure! Way to go Flo!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed when I come here. Service is always fast, friendly and the food is ALWAYS good. I got the Dan Dan noodles with chicken and it was great! They even accommodated me by making it Gluten-Free! I highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed either. The only negative was the hostess didn't say \"bye\" or \" see you next time\" she just watched me walk out. Still enjoy this place though!"}
{"text":"The Princess and I have been huge fans of Flo's for years, since the original Flo's next to Osco on TPPW before they moved across the street.  This location is our local favorite and try to get over from the NW Valley at least once a month. The Saturday $5 lunch special is truly the best lunch value in the value. I really admire her business acumen for recognizing the need to pack her place during the economic downturn, provide excellent jobs, and still make good money on volume rather than GM%, but I digress.  If the food wasn't good, it still wouldn't be worth $5 and it is.  We love the food and especially the generous discounts during happy hour.  My favorite on the menu is the house chow mein with shrimp, chicken, and beef-extra spice. It is one of my all-time favorite things to eat.  The Princess always gets the spicy ginger beef, kind of a play on mongolian beef, it's excellent as well.  Make sure you get the salad with their amazing, one of a kind ginger dressing, you'll want to take some home (and yes they will sell you a container of it).  Hat's off to Flo's! Fantastic food and excellent service!  Well done!"}
{"text":"Since this location is brand new, it wasn't yet on Yelp. I requested for an additional menu to gather information and add the business onto Yelp. I informed our server it was strictly for Yelp adding purposes and that I wasn't going to order anything else. He informed the manager and they sent us a free dessert for helping aid their start to social media. Great management team!! Thanks Flo's!"}
{"text":"If you love Asian food you need to try Flo's reasonable prices & food is off the chart. OMG!! happy hour is fabulous"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Pot stickers wonderful as well as the soy braised tofu. Pricy but delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Flo's is in one word... AWESOME! My family and I had reservations for 6 PM last night. Although the restaurant was very full we were shown to our table promptly at 6. The hostess waited for us to be seated and handed us our menus. She was very personable and answered all of the questions we had. Our bartender Blaze warmly welcomed us back for he must have remembered our faces. Total thumbs up in my book! Chris was also very attentive and the food was DELICIOUS! Blaze very patiently took care us and made the whole family out-ing great. Blaze, Chris, and all of Flo's staff... YOU ROCK! So glad Flo's has opened in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"The Chinese food was alright.  Our egg rolls were probably the best out of everything.  I ordered the cashew chicken and I didn't like it. The chicken was very rubbery.  The twice cooked pork was a tiny bit rubbery. I gave it three stars because the egg rolls were delicious and service was good. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Its ok food. The portions are small especially for Chinese food. I think they actually pour oil directly on the dish. Ive never had food this oily.  I do like that you can ask for extra won tons but they charge you .25 cents a won ton.   Not very good, everything tastes the same.  Im also not sure if they use any hydrogenated oils"}
{"text":"Greatest Happy Hour in Scottsdale!!  Excellent food and drinks and very attentive service.  For a really special dinner, order the Peking duck a day in advance."}
{"text":"It's sad that one of my first reviews is for a restaurant that is so utterly bad.   If I could give it a negative rating I would.   My advice is to skip this place.   The service is slow and the food was cold which I'm guessing are related as it seemed impossible that such a simple dish would take so long coming out of the kitchen.   The beer had stuff floating in the bottom of the glass which looked like sludge from the lines not being serviced. I mentioned the stuff in the glass to the server who ignored the comment and asked if I would like water!?!   The rice is recycled from other tables or I would guess it is as I found food in it! Further had a texture of new and old rice that had been mixed together and reheated several times.   The main dish I ordered was soft and almost without flavor did I mention cold like it sat for 20min.   I could go on but I won't.  I'm going to take something to get rid of this feeling of wanting to vomit."}
{"text":"Wow. Now I know what the fuss was about. Service could improve a bit. But food was very good. Would recommend this place anytime."}
{"text":"YUM! Everything is made fresh and they don't over cook the veggies.  They use a sauce in most of their dishes that is fabulous.  I take my visitors there and they say it is the best Chinese food ever.  Especially the hot and sour soup.  YUM! The service could improve.  When we do take out, it only takes 15 min."}
{"text":"This is my new fav way to eat Asian cuisine. Sorry peiwei doesn't even compare now that they cut their portions. I've been to flos 2x for lunch and dinner and the food is DELICIOUS big portions so I have more for later and the service is incrediable. Friendly waiters and people floating to fill drinks and so helpful with doors when I have the baby with me. Greta atmosphere, great food and great service. I'll go here at least 2x a month :)"}
{"text":"Flo's is awesome! I love all the unconventional Asian dishes available here. They offer mainstream Chinese as well as some other delights from off the beaten path. The curries are all very good. And they make the best brown rice in town. A very solid restaurant. Great choice for a quick lunch under $20."}
{"text":"I love the food at Flo's but the parking and interior acoustics are dreadful. I know, I know, it's not Flo's fault that the parking is difficult, but Yelp is here to help others make educated dining decisions and I think the parking issue is relevant. So there you have it."}
{"text":"It was Sunday night and I'm craving pho . Unfortunately pho restaurants are usually closed on Sundays. So I gave this place a try . I ordered their beef pho and lettuce wraps . Lettuce wraps good typical lettuce wraps . Tasty and satisfying .  Now the pho ...... disappointed. I wasn't expecting much but seriously how can you call that pho . Soup tasted nothing like pho . The meat was good but not the typical meat that goes in pho . Where's the brisket ? Sliced rare beef? Tripe ? Tendon? Ugh I really wasted my money on some watered down not anything tasting pho .   I will definitely not order the pho again but might be back to try the Chinese food but hey I have pretty high expectations for it because of how pricey everything is ."}
{"text":"All those things that Chanel said. Plus lettuce wraps. ~food boner~"}
{"text":"Really good food. The management is really great. The staff is always nice. Very busy location. Get there early!"}
{"text":"This is a really good place to eat....most of the time. I have tried several things off the menu but there is really only one thing I like there, Lunch. Otherwise I would have given it higher marks. they have a fantastic ginger dressing with the lunch salad and to date is still my favorite dressing period. They serve it in advance of the lunch item you ordered and fried won-ton chips come with that. The combined flavors and crunchy of the chips make it a great intro to the main lunch item.  My one and only favorite thing at Flo's it the Ginger Beef. It's in a dark spicy sauce and I also order it with peanuts. This flavor combination will rock you and the beef is very tender.  Try it for lunch some time."}
{"text":"This will always be my favorite Chinese Restaurant!  Hello, $5.00 lunches on Saturday's???  I AM IN!  The service, food and ambiance is always great.  The waitstaff work their tails off to get your food out to you as fast as they can.  The salad dressing is made fresh everyday and is the best dressing I think I have ever had."}
{"text":"I like Flo's for lunch. It's fast, it's tasty, and it's a ton of food for a pittance. I skip the wonton strips that come first and dig into the small green salad with the scrumptious ginger dressing.   My favorite dish here is the Yellow Curry Chicken because it has lots of  veggies. It comes with eggplant, broccoli, onions and peppers and tastes divine without being to overly rich. And there is always more than enough for a second meal. All that for just over 8 bucks (drink not included) is a heck of a good lunch deal. Lunch is served until 3pm too, which is nice for people who prefer a later lunch like I do."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and reasonable prices.  Love their soup!   So good and fresh.  Very clean and neat."}
{"text":"What a great surprise and a gem of a find! While some of the servers are quite young and clearly learning the ropes (we all learn somewhere, sometime), the service was excellent and the food was great. It is shocking that this place was a McDonalds for many, many years, you'd never know it,...and I know it! They did a fantastic job remodeling and rebuilding to make it very open, lively, warm, welcoming and a fun atmosphere.  The food was excellent!  All the ingredients were clearly fresh and each plate made to order. Spices were alive and spot on. Drinks were excellent! We went during happy hour and the value was incredible!! We had 4 or 5 appetizers, where were all good size and 2 drinks and the bill was less than $30,...and we were both stuffed and very, very satisfied! The manager stopped by to say hi and he was a super friendly, knowledgeable, caring guy, that was great.  This is seriously one of the best restaurants in the area. We only had appetizers and drinks but the entrees on the other tables looked delicious and huge and steamy hot!! I can't wait to go back and try them. If they are as good as the apps and drinks we had, I may need to \"up\" my review to even higher.  Really, stop in and try this hidden little gem, you won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go. Asked for a small modification on one entree (\"can you leave one item out\"), but when we got it, it was not modified. So I just paid $15 for an entree I can't eat. Even if it was made modified, it was very dry. The other entree was just ok. Not worth the cost. I hade Asian food from food carts with better flavor.  Cost did not reflect quality. Too bad, since it's close to my house :/"}
{"text":"It's an okay place. I liked 1 out of the 4 dishes that our table ordered. Very clean place and staff was friendly. Expensive for the food though."}
{"text":"Flo's is absolutely delicious! Their hot and sour soup is an absolute must, as are the lettuce wraps and cashew chicken! GREAT happy hour as well. Their wine list could use a little work though.."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, not the highest quality ingredients (I usually have a few bites of chicken not worth eating). But overall a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, busy for lunch with good lunch prices.  However, two of our meals - teriyaki chicken and cashew chicken were substantially overcooked and very tough, hardly \"stir fry\"."}
{"text":"Best Food in Tempe & Scottsdale however I prefer Tempe (closer to home) prices are so great! I cannot say enough about the Food! It's the BEST! Staff are Amazing too!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Flos 5 times and this was my worst experience here.  The food is still not here and we have been here for 30 minutes.  They said they were so busy that all of their 12-15 tea pots were being used by customers, but I looked around and saw only one table with a teapot.  Then, we waited 10 minutes for a tea refill.  The waitress must have realized we were becoming impatient because she excused the slowness and apologized.  However, the other Flos is always more busy but also more prompt.  So I know they have an example to live up to.  Really disappointed.  Won't be back. Won't recommend."}
{"text":"First time at Flo's last night and I was impressed!   My partner and I wanted to take my parents out for dinner and since my mother loves Asian food, we decided to try something different.   We all shared several different appetizers and dishes and the food was full of flavor and fresh!! We might of found a new favorite Asian restaurant.   The establishment was clean and sleek looking. It wasn't too hectic busy, but it was not dead either for a Sunday evening.   The service was great as well. Our server was personable and very helpful.   The prices were lower compared to other Asian establishments I have visited in the past.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a different place to eat at."}
{"text":"Good Asian food, can't give a complete review because I am very unadventurous and order the sweet and sour chicken every time, but that itself is great!  The Pre-meal salad is also good, coming from someone who is not an avid salad eater.  The only downside is the dressing coats your throat and you will be tasting it throughout the remainder of the day!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the happy hour prices but enjoying a good Southeast Asian Peanut Chicken. The place is hopping but it is loud inside. That is the only real negative."}
{"text":"Fav Chinese in Phoenix area!  Fast order/take out too.  Family always wants Flos when they visit.  I like very spicy and lots of veggies."}
{"text":"I'm picky when is comes to Asian food. I used to work at a Japanese restaurant owned by a Japanese chef and I can never find anything that compares until now.  I was here lunch and had the summer spring rolls and chicken katsu.  Both were excellent.  The rice they serve with it is delicious.  I'll be back soon to try other dishes for sure. Mitchell took care me and the service was perfect.  Highly recommend Flo's."}
{"text":"Flos's is the place to go for happy hour! Seven days a week half priced drinks and appetizers! Need I say more? Ok... Appetizers are delicious and the cocktails are on point! I don't live in Scottsdale, or even in Arizona for that matter, but I do visit frequently and I make sure Flo's is on my list of \"must do's\"! The staff are professional and friendly. They check on you often enough to make sure you are well taken care of, but not too often so they don't interrupt your conversation with friends and family. The lighting in Flo's is perfect for the romantic and also for that business lunch! I love the atmosphere at Flo's and I'm sure you will too."}
{"text":"When we first moved here six years ago, we really liked going to Flo's. Their dishes were tasty and interesting to the pallet.  The two of us came for a late lunch and thought wow, things have gotten very expensive and the food was just okay.   I agree with everything my friend Marvin A wrote in his updated review just a few months ago. http://www.yelp.com/biz/flos-scottsdale-3?hrid=TJuxgsGDqv6OjBCHJk7gpw   Also, my friend Scott D brings up some very good points as well. http://www.yelp.com/biz/flos-scottsdale-3?hrid=l4MSDHKXs1IDBvKn1TjaHQ  So I call your attention to both of their reviews.   It seems Flo's no longer has a Luncheon Menu, only smaller portions of their regular dinner menu. We decided to start off with some pork Pot Stickers for $5.00. We were vanquished, so I decided to ordered two (if only to have some for later, or so I thought). These however were minis, barely half the normal size (see photo) and bland  Our lunch entrees were Chicken with Cashew for $9.00 and the Chicken Asian Peanut sauce over noodles for $11.50 (photos). Both were okay, just not memorable as we remembered eating in Flo's in the past.   We were saddened to see the direction Flo's has taken. There is no je ne sais quoi anymore. So our return factor is pretty low, though we might give them another try at some point.   Our lunch bill came in at $30.50 and our server Irene, was very good and kept our water glasses filled. So two and a half stars and barely \"A-Okay\". Now, where have you taken Flo?"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the food. We ordered lettuce wraps, pot stickers, orange chicken and a few other \"to-share\" dishes and it was all amazing. However, the service here is terrible. I'm not sure why because usually it is pretty dead for the most part, but it is terrible service. Recommend the food, not the service. Maybe order take-out."}
{"text":"21/2 years in AZ and we have thrown away more Chinese food than we have eaten, I had given up.  But someone took me here, I was of course hesitant.  I ordered the Lo Mein.  Service was very fast and the place is crisp and clean.  We were given a small salad, the dressing was delicious, I licked the plate.  The Lo Mein was more of a chow mein but not quite what I have been looking for but fresh, good, very very good.  I ate it all, did not throw it away.  Looking forward to going back and trying something else.   FINALLY!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened this time, but we had to wait for forty minute for our order, and the spring rolls were very greasy.  The rest of the order was only mediocre.  Too bad"}
{"text":"Great happy hour and it lasts till 7pm! CHEERS to that!  Half price all drinks and appetizers. The chicken wings are delicious! The service has been slow but only when all tables are full and that is understandable. They are doing something right!"}
{"text":"This isn't bad Chinese, but it's not great. I got the sesame Thai peanut chicken. The only thing \"peanut\" about it was the fact that there were chopped peanuts in it. What about the Thai peanut sauce? Aw, bummer. At least the veggies were good and the chicken wasn't bad! The service here is really good, and the staff are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Flo's is excellent. I love the food here. Quality tasting, good portions and great service. We love all the dishes we ordered, and in love with the wide beef noodle dish."}
{"text":"Definitely americanized asian cuisine. But very good none the less. I had the green curry and it was pretty good. I'd definitely recommend it to other people."}
{"text":"Arrived for dinner with minimal wait time. First impression very noisy. Wait staff very attentive. But lack luster food. Pool of grease came under the spring rolls and the entree was very dry."}
{"text":"great food, and fast friendly service.  We go there often and also get takeout.  It's definitely a go-to restaurant for guest in town or when we are in the mood for chinese.  The only reason I can't give 5 stars is that I wish the menu was broader or more creative.  I end up ordering the same 2-3 things everytime.  Still one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"It was good, but it was overpriced for quantity and what you got. Guess I'll go back if I really need to. Will definitely investigate less expensive options. I think it's the most I've ever paid for Asian food. Was desperate for a quick meal. Wasn't all that quick even"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  Place looked great inside.  We had lunch off of the appetizer menu.  Lettuce wraps were fantastic, as were pot stickers.  Our waitress was Stephanie, and she took good care of us.  I was really impressed with the whole place and am glad to see this type of food available.  We would not hesitate to try it for dinner as well.  I found the price to be very reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"The fact that this place is so crowded at lunchtime just confirms my suspicion that most Scottsdale residents have more money than taste.  This place is aggressively mediocre and proud of it.  You could get better Chinese at Applebee's for a lot less money.  I had to load on the soy sauce and chili oil just to make my lunch have any taste at all, and even then it tasted like mildly spiced dishwater.  Pretty bad when even your chili oil lacks flavor and authenticity."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night to give it another try.  Something is going on in the kitchen as the food is getting worse.  Had potstickers, small and tasteless, lettuce wraps, lettuce wilted, chicken and snap peas, white meat not soft and tender without sauce like it used to be and lacking in flavor.  If the food was better we could put up with the noise level which is terrible, but afraid we have to find another place for chinese food.  Somehow, the place is going down hill fast.  Sorry."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and so was our waiter. The price is very reasonable.  Other than our excellent waiter, every other employee was rude and aloof. The woman seating us said nothing, but pointed to where we should sit. The man bringing out our food gave the impression he was in a big hurry, and could care less about us. As we left, a woman said in a monotone voice \"Thank you for coming\" without looking up from what she was reading.  We arrived as the restaurant opened at noon on a Sunday. There were very few people there, but they sat us all close together. It was extremely loud because there is little to soften the echoes and noise from other tables. If we go there again, we will ask to be seated far from where others are seated."}
{"text":"I love Flo's... they have lunch specials during the week only that include brown or white rice and a salad.  Love the miso dressing... its delicious!  I usually get the kung pao chicken... friend likes the double cooked pork or something like that.  Happy is great... 1/2 price appetizers and drinks!  With the happy hour apps they are full size... not smaller due to 1/2 price.  Wings are good, potstickers are yummy too.  You can order lunch size portion anytime but I don't think you get the salad with it if its not during lunch.  I think I like the other location on Frank Lloyd Wright better... it seems they do things differently there... i.e. I think you can get fried rice with lunch special there where I found that at this location...  if you want fried rice... you just have to get an order of it."}
{"text":"the food is decent, not my favorite place to go but you definitely get a good meal. and the prices are great, especially for how much food you get. the people inside have always been very nice as well. so no complaints."}
{"text":"\"BLAND\" is my one word summary  1) vegetable dumplings...i'd say it was frozen then thawed out and tasted like pot stickers you'd get anywhere...the one's at Fate now those were good. (2 stars)  2) hot & sour soup was huge which is usually a good thing...but useless if it doesn't taste hot & sour at all...all I tasted was sweet & more sweet soup. (1 stars)  3) chicken vindaloo (what was I thinking ordering and indian dish at a chinese place?)  anyways probably the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life and tasted absolutely nothing like chicken vindaloo. (0 stars)  4) wife had vegetable fried rice...i think they forgot that we ordered everything spicy...had no flavor and i think they even forgot the soy sauce to make it fried rice (1 star)  on a positive note my wife did like the free salad and wonton chips and the service was good.  overall I wouldn't give this place another try even with all the stellar reviews."}
{"text":"Food was great, but I was disappointed with their customer service. When ordering a plate that came with a side of white rice, I asked them if they could substitute the white rice with fried rice and I offered to pay them extra to do so. They said that there was no way that they would be able to do that even after I insisted that I'd pay them a good amount just so that I could have fried rice... just seems like a simple request from a customer that would do the restaurant no harm, especially when the customer is willing to pay for the substitution..."}
{"text":"The food here tastes good and overall it's a nice place but the prices are high for the quality/qty of food you receive, point in case the fried rice is $13 and whichever protein you add is proportionately small. Kids meals are $7 for a large serving which is great. Happy hour makes drinks and apps. half off which is nice. There are many other Chinese cuisine options that offer better quality food at a more affordable price.  The downside to dining in is that it's loud, mega loud inside but if you're a large group this would be a good place since the service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Good food and service was efficient. We ordered the pad Thai and yellow chicken curry soup. Both with quite delicious and savory. While the pad Thai wasn't traditional, their spin on the dish was quite pleasing. The yellow curry with chicken is absolutely delicious, a must try! The restaurant is located in a busy plaza and has very clean upscale decor. Give them a shot and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. The best happy hour ever. Half price appetizers, half price drinks, and the food is amazing. This is our new favorite local hang out place in south Tempe."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here twice and I dont think Ill ever eat here again. I ordered the lettuce wraps and the food smelled like horrible BO. It made me so nauseous I couldnt even eat it. The salad is decent but I still cant get over that smell!"}
{"text":"I'm had an appointment in Tempe & when I left I was looking for a place to eat and Flo's caught my eye. Very nice place. Very clean. The service from employees was outstanding! I truly enjoyed my lunch special, it was a lot, plenty left over for dinner :) I will differently be going back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place but they definitely have some things to work on. I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could.   Pros: food is great, service is good, drinks are strong, restaurant looks nice.  Cons: if you come during dinner time it is extremely loud. They did an extremely poor job with sound management. It would also be nice if they put some booths in as the seating isn't the most comfortable. Also seems like they might be understaffed, though I myself am surprised a restaurant is this busy on a Wednesday evening!   I think this place has a lot of potential. They do a very interesting mix of Asian foods including Chinese, Indian, Thai, etc. I really hope they can work out their kinks. Especially the sound.. It wasn't fun to sit here in silence with my fiance."}
{"text":"Average food, average service, average prices and thereby an average rating. This place is nothing out of the ordinary. We primarily decided to go here because of decent ratings and reviews, but weren't really impressed with anything. First of all, they seated us right next to the entrance door, saying that the rest of the area \"was closed\", although I could clearly see people eating there. After requesting several times, we got a better seat, and shortly after we were seated in the \"closed\" section, a group of 10 people were seated there. Seriously guys? We ordered the green curry chicken, and the scallops/mushrooms as entrees, both were okay at best. Definitely a one time eat place, life is too short for just ordinary! :-)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to dinner here and her meal came out with the wrong type of noodles so they went ahead and remade the dish for her. Then our waitress informed us that the manager and her went ahead and comped our WHOLE $34 meal (2 entrees and an appetizer) for us because of the kitchen's mistake. Good food and great customer service!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a great place for happy hour! We sat at the bar food and service was great and such a good price!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Flo's!  This review is only for their lunch menu, but let's face it - it is all delicious! The lunch menu is such a great deal for the food that is prepared for you. Tried the chicken chow fun and katsu chicken, and both dishes were fresh and extremely tasty. My mother and I both said, \"Wow, this fried rice is amazing!\" I would highly recommend for anyone needing an option to select. We both needed To Go boxes to bring the rest of our food home!  The interior decor kind of relaxes me and feels zen. I will be a regular of Flo's as long as their around!"}
{"text":"My new happy place when it comes to Asian food. It's trendy, casual but not too informal, the open space is great for groups or if you feel like having a drink at the bar and a solo meal. Kitchen ran smooth, apps were done and entrees quickly followed. Staff is super friendly and our servers had great suggestions to try, and explained the tastes perfectly. Def worth trying something new every visit, been here more than 3 times and haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"It disappoints me to give Flo's a 1 star as the food at their Scottsdale location has been decent but I will not return to this one again. After ordering, we were sitting for an over extended period of time for our food. (Ordered carry out). After a while someone brought out a carry out order to the desk but the attendants were not there. Finally the girl walked back to us and said she was going to check on our order. the next thing I see is that she is coming out the other door and walks toward one of her friends working and strikes up a casual conversation completely forgetting about us waiting. I decide to get up to look at the order they brought out and it was ours! Talk about bad service.  So... we get home to eat (ordered the Lemongrass chicken. The dish was completely without flavor and was only a bunch of noodles and some small pieces of chicken. Everything else was left out including the flavor. Charging as much as they do for measly dishes is just plain out ripping people off.  I would never recommend anyone eating here. There is Yupha's Thai and many other delicious places around with much better service staff and quality of food."}
{"text":"Pot stickers round 1 still very doughy asked for chili paste showed up after I finished round one pot stickers round 2 pot stickers better than round  1 showed up with chili paste ........ had to request water3 times .........."}
{"text":"I thought we were in for something special. After driving from Chandler just to try this place, we were gravely disappointed. The food was average at best. The mangolian beef was burnt and flavorless (See attached). Trust me, you'll drive past better Asian food places to get here. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty! Big menu, I feel I could eat here often without getting bored. I had the shrimp wontons to start which were good but nothing special. The shrimp chili stir fry for entree was full of flavor on the other hand and presented beautifully. My girlfriend and the shrimp pad Thai. She said it was delicious with thick noodles and a light sauce. Their food feels light and fresh instead of heavy and saucy like so many Asian restaurants. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday, first time there.  I found the atmosphere very cold a barren.  They had hard rock music on, which made me dizzy.  Service was good, didn't have to wait long. the place was almost empty (at noon).  Food was good, small portions. I had Kung Pau Chicken, nice and spicy.  Wife had asparagus chicken, I felt it was too bland. Probably not go back."}
{"text":"Passing by the opposite direction on way to an appointment saw this place and thought it looked different form what I usually see in Tempe. Baseline is a changing from our living there 20 years ago. Most of the businesses have changed or been replaced with new buildings and businesses.along Baseline.  This place had a vibe look to it and after our business in Tempe i pulled into Flo's for lunch. It was a very open floor, many tables inside and a nice patio outside with hanging wired lights which gives a feeling of fun. Of course it was lunch and no need for lights but the patio was clean and had a modern look. Have to go back some evening and enjoy  the ambiance with the great food.  Back to lunch. It took us a little extra time deciding as it was our first time eating there. I coped out and went easy ordering the Chicken teriyaki and a app of pot stickers. My wife had so curry something. It looked and tasted good. I enjoyed my meal and the service was more than excellent.  As Arnold says, I'll b bac"}
{"text":"We can't figure out why all of the rave reviews. We've been here several times with friends, and the best thing about the place isn't the unique food, but the unique decor. The food is O.K., but not outstanding. The lettuce wraps don't even come close to PF Chang's wraps, the chicken skewers with peanut sauce were overcooked - dry and chewy, the peanut sauce gloppy and thick, the chicken fried rice was not flavorful at all. The Mongolian beef was good.  You can't beat half-off happy hour, though. Maybe that's why the place gets such rave reviews - after a few drinks, almost anything tastes good!"}
{"text":"I usually just get take-out from this place, so I can't speak for an important factor - the service. Whenever I get take-out however, they have a good amount of food and doesn't take too long to be ready.   Worth mentioning: The hot and sour soup is amazing. I would seriously get take-out just to get that soup. The mushrooms especially are phenomenal. Who would do shrooms when Flo has much better mushrooms in her soups? Ha!"}
{"text":"We ordered a to go order and when we got to the restaurant they forgot to place the order and tried to make us believe we ordered the food from a different location! We asked for the manager he apologized and told us he would cover the bill and when the food came out he over charged charged us and the amount ended up being $37.00! Since we paid for the food we reluctantly ate is and it was horrible! Bad management, horrible take out department, nasty food! If I could give zero start I would! Don't waist your time McDonalds down the street has better service! Oh wait! This property was a McDonalds! Don't waist your time this place is bad!"}
{"text":"I love this place and it really is the only good Chinese restaurant in the area that's not super, super casual. (Asian Island is good but it is really casual).   Their won ton soup is so amazing and delicious. It is huge for $5. LOVE this soup.   I had the sweet and sour chicken and my boyfriend had the chicken katsu. The sweet and sour chicken was really good and \"typical\" flavors. The katsu was soo yummy I ate more of his than mine. I keep sneaking my fork onto the plate for some of that delicious rice. Katsu it is for me on our next trip to Flos.  It would be nice if the restaurant wasn't so modern looking, I love the traditional Chinese food places. The atmosphere is still really nice though so I can't fault them too much."}
{"text":"This place has the best happy hour on the planet. Every day from 3-7. Even weekends. Half price on all drinks, including bottles of wine. Half price on all appetizers, of which there is a substantial selection and the food is fresh and good.   We had:  A bottle of wine ($38 full price) Chicken satay Lettuce wraps Chicken pot stickers Shu Mai dumplings Teriyaki chicken skewers  Hot and sour soup  Veggie Lo mein Grand total before tip: $55.05 And a lot of yummy left overs!!"}
{"text":"Great food and a good price! Owners are nice too! I have only been to the Scottsdale location but I'm sure all are great!!"}
{"text":"Two words - HAPPY HOUR!!! Actually- more words - SEVEN DAYS A WEEK! Appetizers are almost all half price, drink specials are totally reasonable. The spring rolls are so good. Spicy ginger beef - yummy. Orange chicken w sauce on the side. Mongolian beef - add spicy. I could go on and on. Only thing I didn't Love was the calamari. Bar staff is nice, and happy hour - again- is seven days a week!"}
{"text":"All the food is good, spicy lettuce wraps are so great!! And the happy hour from 3-7 is truly a great deal. Love Flo's"}
{"text":"Trying to find good Thai in Phoenix can be a challenge. So is trying to find good Chinese that doesn't make you want to fall asleep an hour afterwards. I think Flo's just came up 2 for 1. My GF is gluten free and loves calamari, loves breaded calamari but can't eat it. Bam. In comes Flo's to save the day. They have this seasoning that imitates breading and is actually pretty awesome. I had the spicy pork and added pineapple. Recommendation of the the waitress and bam, home run! It was out of the park good.  The portion size is great for the average person to have two servings. I'll admit it, I ate the whole thing.   So good."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The menu looked great and the restaurant looks nice, but the food is just awful. Ordered shrimp skewers and spicy orange chicken. The shrimp was probably the worst shrimp I have ever had. The orange chicken comes with the sauce on the side. Sauce was decent but the chicken, which was breaded and fried, was awful. Really chewy and had a strange texture.   I know this restaurant was converted from an old McDonald's and sadly I wished I had gone across the street to McDonald's instead."}
{"text":"Flo's is the bomb-diggity. My family has known Flo since she was the cook at Eddie Chan's in Scottsdale. I loved that little hole in the wall Chinese restaurant and was sad when they closed and reopened in Cave Creek as an expensive up-scale place. But Flo's is still affordable. The portion sizes are good (I can't even eat a whole kids order of sweet & sour chicken) and they now have steamed bbq pork buns *drool*. The atmosphere is a little nerve-racking though. Maybe it's the bare floors and high ceilings but it always seems loud and chaotic there."}
{"text":"I LOVE Flo's!!!!  They have great service, the food is delicious and well priced.  This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch or to take out of town guests.  I especially love their salad and their lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"I don't know how to describe it, but the food tastes clean here, and I think its a good thing.  We ordered take out, I had the Chicken Lo Mein, the wife had the Seared Ahi Salad, and we shared an order of the fried shrimp and bacon.  Everything tasted great, and it didn't leave me with the greasy regret feeling afterwards. At about $40 with tip, it beats cooking."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour. Drinks and Appetizers are half off from 3-7. Ordered Wonton Soup which I did not like at all and Spicy Wontons which I did not like. Teriyaki Chicken Skewers were very good and the Pork Fried Rice was very good. Chicken Lettuce Wraps were very good too. Service could have been better, but it was happy hour. I don't think I will come back but gave it 3 stars as it may just be my personal taste, as it always seems to be busy there."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant! Very clean and great atmosphere. The food is always good, fresh, and very well seasoned. They have really good lunch specials also."}
{"text":"Trying to decide what to do for dinner the other night ... we settled on Chinese.  So at Flo's - we selected Lemon Pepper Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken.  We shared both dishes - and both were loaded with flavor and just hit the spot.  There was not one morsel of food left on either platter.  Can't wait for the next visit!  Service was great, and It's nice to see the owner circulate and ensure service and food lives up to her expectations.  Well done!"}
{"text":"The worst service i have ever gotten at any restaurant.  It took 30 min. just to get drinks. I will NEVER go back. After not getting out order after 40min. we left."}
{"text":"They have redeeemed themselves! I was really craving chicken vindaloo and was in Tempe so decided to see if things had changed.  It was absolutely delicious.  The vindaloo was done perfectly and the service was great. So glad to see that they are now up to the level of the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Have to say the quality is going down hill as is the service.  We typically go here once a week and the last two times have been less than desirable. The service was slow and the food was warm at best.   I hope they turn it around because we used to really love going there."}
{"text":"used to be a daily lunch spot when I didn't want to deal with the chaos inside ajs just for a salad. I've never once disliked anything. the service is quick and quiet. 99% of the time it's busy but the ticket time is super quick so tables are turned in no time. idk wtf is going on with those little peanut cookies they give opposed to a fortune cookie but I could eat a million of them."}
{"text":"Nice decor, clean & semi decent food. Still searching for good, authentic asian food in scottsdale-it doesnt look too compromising :("}
{"text":"Went to Flo's tonight, we ordered hot and sour soup, which was very sour & not hot at all; crunchy tofu with veggies, which was ok, one of the highlights of the meal; veggie chow mein, which was tasteless; veggie fried rice was ok, nothing special; and moo shu chicken, which wasn't good. The majority of the meal was tasteless. There were 5 of us in total, and we paid $50 plus tip."}
{"text":"First of all, there really is a Flo. It's her face on the website, and you will see her at Flo's Chinese Restaurant often, walking the tables, checking on her guests, a strong quiet presence. Here is what I think you need to know: Flo gets it.  She understands what people want, how much, how fast, and she get's that while things are better, they can still be tight.   Iv'e been to dinner at Flo's with a party as big as 17.  Finding a restaurant that will please the 17 distinct and neurotic personalities of food-mates, (Settle down, I keep you anonymous) is no small task.   There are roughly 15 Appetizers to choose from, and Flo's sweet and sour sauce is the mortar we use to hold them all together. It is great on everything, and I've poured it straight from the saucer into my mouth. It's so good I've devoted a whole paragraph to it. Back to the Appetizers. My daughter Olivia will lie right to your face to get an extra Flo's spring roll. She will fake a limp, put her arm in a sling, ask you if you've lost weight. Whatever it takes. Our Wing-nut, we'll call him Cluck Norris, calls Flo's Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings one of his favorites.  I'm happy enough with the little bowl of wontons and sweet and sour sauce, Flo's version of chips and salsa, that come to the table gratis.   Flo's offers a green dinner salad. The lettuce is fresh, topped with some orange slices, pretty standard stuff. It's the dressing, this magnificent, green, sweet, horseradishey (look it up, it's an actual culinary term) nectar that is absolutely fabulous. We've tried to coax a few of the ingredients out of Flo's savvy and tight-lipped crew, telling them we have allergies and that it's a safety concern, but no dice. They smile knowingly and give nothing away.  The main courses are solid, and we can't budge our kids from their favorites. My son, 19 and 6'7\" has two favorites, the Cinnamon Shrimp and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. The shrimp are plump and sautéed with peas and carrots in a sweet-spicy sauce with a hint of cinnamon. It is served, as several of Flo's dishes are, over shredded lettuce. Yeah, shredded lettuce. My favorite dish, the Lemon Pepper Shrimp and Chicken, comes over shredded lettuce and it hits all the gustatory pleasure zones. The shrimp pops in your mouth, the chicken is sliced thin and together with the lemon and pepper, the oils and scallions, is savory and spicy, crunchy and rich. I have to tell you, I've tried to speak while eating it and drooled right in front of a loan officer I'd taken to lunch. It's just the price of doing business at Flo's.   A Chinese restaurant is only as good as it's Sweet and Sour Sauce. I know an authentic sweet and sour sauce is supposed to be browner than it is red. The sweet is supposed to come from the sugars in fruit or honey, the sour from vinegar. So, in terms of authenticity, where's all the ubiquitous bright red sauce come from? I don't care. I want my Sweet and Sour sauce really sweet, and slut lipstick red. Flo's delivers.  It is soo good.  I could eat a bowl of white rice, drenched in Flo's Sweet and Sour, every day for the next 9 months and not get bored. When I'm alone, I like to take a big table spoon of it and smash it into my face then pull the spoon away and let it fall down my shirt, then I spend the next 3 minutes licking my lips. Yeah, I have a problem."}
{"text":"I had a take out of Cashew Chicken a few months ago since Flo's was on the way home from work, I believe it was in the $12 dollar range. I thought the meal had no real taste to it. I didn't even finish my meal, which is a rare occurence for me.  I just don't get how the restaurant is always filled. There are much better Chinese food options around Scottsdale such as Ling & Louies or Asian Island to name a couple.  Oh well, let the lemmings keep coming back for more, they just don't know any better."}
{"text":"For the life of me, I cannot understand why everyone loves Flo's.  The only thing that this place appears to have going for it is the location.  In this neighborhood, they really are the only option for quick Asian food.  I've been stuck ordering food from here several times because my Starbucks of choice, jeweler, waxer, and nail place are all in this shopping center; when you only have 15 minutes in between appointments and you are starving, sometimes you just have to suck it up.  The service is horrible, especially at the bar.  The bartenders typically spend most of their time socializing with one another and other servers.  There have been a few times that a dirty glass from another patron (or an empty glass from me) have sat unnoticed and are only cleared or refilled after flagging someone down.  The food is a hit-or-miss experience.  It's either good or completely shameful (tending more towards the shameful).  The crab puffs are good, but only if you adore warm cream cheese with a few hints of fake crab.  The summer rolls have potential, but could be improved if they didn't put so much shredded iceberg lettuce inside.  Their idea of pho is a total joke.  The beef is well done strips of leather (not rare) and they use overcooked noodles that have no business being in pho.  Their pad thai is moosh and pretty sad (if you want excellent pad thai, you should try the Wild Thaiger--amazing!).  The final insult came when they started using spaghetti noodles in the Lo Mein.  They do offer a great deal on Saturdays ($5 lunch) but it reminds me of Nordstrom's Last Chance; yeah, the prices are stellar, but who cares if you can't find anything of quality?  The only reason they are getting two stars, instead of one, is because of the few appetizers that have been edible.  So, if you are stuck there because of a nail or wax appointment, go ahead and take a chance, but you will probably regret it."}
{"text":"This location just opened in June and I finally stopped in last night with friends to check it out.  SO glad we did!  There were six of us so I had the opportunity to try a bit of everything!  Such a great menu and I couldn't find a dish on our table that wasn't awesome!  A bit pricey, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment!! Love their Scottsdale's original location. Thought this would be the same but it was at best mediocre food. The service sucked. The waitress was inefficient and didn't care much. We ordered the spice dish which was the worst I have ever had.  Compared to the other locations this one is just a let down  Will probably give it one try otherwise just one step up from Panda Express!"}
{"text":"Pricey and Bland.  We ordered takeout for the whole family.  Spicy Orange chicken sauce was ok but even with the sauce the deep fried chicken had an ultra bland taste. Black Pepper chicken was a little better, but overloaded with huge onion chunks and bell peppers about 8-1 ratio Onion and bell pepper to chicken.  Crispy spring rolls were also a dud.  The place was packed, but it was 7pm on a Friday night and it's new to the area.  My wife said the tofu was descent.  Long story short I'd go to Pei Wei or PF Chang's 10 out of 10 times over this place."}
{"text":"The egg drop soup comes in a HUGE portion. Like, it was surprising to get that much soup for that price and as an appetizer. It was delightful though! I had the pad thai and loved it! My husband has the Kung Pao and said it was the best he's ever had. Would definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"So the story...this place was started by Paul Fleming...who started PF Changs, after he sold Changs off to the restaurant group.  It's been a long time since I lived in Phoenix, but that was the urban legend back then.    The food is solid, as is the line at lunch."}
{"text":"Always solid service, food, love the updates they did to the restaurant (beautiful booths, colors, pux).  Clean, friendly and the best chinese fusion in the area.   Been coming to flos for over a decade..saturday 6.00 lunch.. Amazing! Salad + seems like over 20+ items to choose from for sat special. I would come and pay full price :) arrive before 12 noon the place will be packed by 12:10.  -flos bbq pork+ chicken fried rice always a must. Chili oil and their yummy salad with their signature dressing. Delish!  Support local! Your belly will thank you."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Was told it was like pf changs (not as good) Close to my house. Decent Chinese. Friendly staff. I eat here atleast once a month."}
{"text":"Half price happy hour is what caught my eye, since I have teenagers that eat a ton!  In and out is easy so long as you go before 5:30, otherwise there is a bit of a wait.  Food quality good and love all of the shrimp dishes!"}
{"text":"I'm not particularly a fan of fusion but Flo's is definitely the exception. The food and service was great!"}
{"text":"Flo's has done an amazing job of remodeling an old McDonalds. The former McDonalds' drive-thru is now outdoor seating and the inside has been redone in a \"yuppie-wannabe\" sleek, modern look. It was 12:30pm on a cold, rainy day and the place was not even half full.   I was seated right away and my server brought me some water and took my order promptly. I requested some hot green tea since it was a cold day. Beverages are not listed on the menu, so I have no idea what this costs. I never did find out since they never brought my tea. My server stopped back as I finished my meal and I told him to cancel the tea since I was done eating.  I ordered the Lemon Chicken ($9 for lunch) with brown rice. This was supposed to be a special recipe of the chef. Unfortunately, there was no detectable lemon flavor--in fact no flavor at all. Surprisingly, this was the most bland Asian food I have ever encountered. It was so bland that I could not even eat half of the food on the plate (and this was a smaller portion size than most Asian restaurants serve). The chicken was odd in that it was in small flat squares--sort of like the frozen meat chunks you encounter at YC's Mongolian Grill.  I was also brought a small salad with some kind of ginger-peanut sauce on it. It was OK, nothing special. It was also a surprise since there is nothing on the menu about salads being included with my meal. The obligatory fortune cookie shows up with the bill.  The restaurant is clean and the staff efficient (except for the hot tea fiasco). Parking has always been difficult in this particular shopping center. I probably would not go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Have been back twice since my initial visit.. Not too pricey but fast and delicious food with fantasic waiting staff and a pleasent decor"}
{"text":"Fastest lunch ever.  Great vegan options.  Friendly service.  I wish my wife liked Chines because it would definitely be a dinner option.  For now, it's my quickie lunches at the bar.  Fried rice and crispy tofu!"}
{"text":"LOVE Flo's!  We have been coming here for over four years, and it's a family favorite.  The food is always FRESH, the service reliable, and the flavors amazing.  My family has their favorites:  the Wonton soup, a light broth, with fresh basil, sliced char sui pork, and wontons; egg drop soup with shrimp; we always get two orders of Calamari, which is sooo addictive- chewy crunchy with vegetables and a salty-spice seasoning; fabuloso lettuce wraps, no special sauces needed; and my youngest loves the crab puffs.  Note- I haven't even addressed the entree's, but we have had many and have never been disappointed.  We usually order our usual orange-style chicken (kids), and one other entree that's new to us.  Truly, never a bad experience.  I'm partial to the vegetarian eggplant dish, and the YangChow fried rice.  I'm just getting ready to take my family there now for dinner, in fact!  We have done Mother's day there, and family birthdays.  There is so much variety, and everyone is happy.  Prices have gone up, but lunch deals are great."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned, Flo's Chinese Restaurant can expand their mini dynasty into MY neighborhood!  I'd heard largely good things about Flo's and decided to take it in, myself.  Surprise, surprise...it's in a strip mall, but a quaint one at that.  The interior is sorta (sub)urban-chic.  It's a mix of upscale and low-brow with linen table cloths and throwaway paper napkins.  Cool enough for adults, yet casual enough if you're bringing the kids.  I was fortunate in that unlike some other Yelpers, I had no trouble finding a parking spot and the decibel level was comfortable.  The hostess was smiley and seated me right away.  The server and busboy (or is that bus man???) were quick to have ice water, crispy won tons with duck sauce and a complimentary side salad (iceburg, romaine, carrot slivers) on the table within seconds.  It's evident they are aware the lunch crowd may not have time for a long wait.  I didn't go crazy, sticking to a couple of \"safe\" options ordering the orange chicken with steamed white rice and the Triple Chocolate Mousse.  The dessert was pretty, but just OK for flavor and texture.  However, I have to say the chicken was fantastic; moist without too much batter!  I've had orange chicken at many other restaurants before and have been served lumps of fried dough with an indiscernible amount of actual chicken.  Not the case at Flo's!  The portions were good and the prices very reasonable: just $7 for the lunchtime entree!  Next time I'll take advantage of the $5 special on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"Overrated and pricey, with a combination of bland food And complete lack of service. Avoid this place, unless that Is what you are looking for."}
{"text":"I took my father here for dinner because I had heard so many good things about it. The restaurant was relatively slow when we arrived. We were sat by a very friendly hostess and waters were promptly delivered. Then we sat at our table for over 15 minutes without receiving any further service. I had to ask the hostess to find our waitress for us.  Once they finally came over and took our order they hardly seemed apologetic for the neglect. In addition to having to wait so long to even place our order they forgot my order when the food finally arrived. I will not take anything away from the quality of their food but the service is less than up to standard. Id recommend getting take out."}
{"text":"Great Design Very Modern Excellent Food  Menu & there wonderful HH EVERY Day like in N. Scottsdale. Staff Super friendly !!  Glad to see it here as we just moved to Tempe after YEARS in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Since Day One~ Month One ~I have gone to this restaurant. Recommended it to Many Many people- Clients, Friends, my Real Estate office-taken many of our family and friends but usually go ourselves, usually 2X a month.... because we were able to get in and enjoy a inexpensive HH- ...  But tonight we were skipped over after waiting almost 30 mins-  and did not get in-they now have a call in reservation or call in wait list . I think Long time loyalty should be recognized. Sorry Flo-  you shouldn't leave LONG TIME CUSTOMERS STANDING- who come ALL Year round for the SNOW BIRDS."}
{"text":"Meets all the criteria for a splendid lunch.  Quick and efficient service.  Great prices.  Food that doesn't make you want to take a 2pm nap.  And food that is exceptionally tasty....even a tad healthy."}
{"text":"Fred,Flo and the entire staff are delightful. it is my neighborly placeto go for a carry out, or even a cocktail with friends, or best yet to have a nice meal in the casually elegant dining area.                i have had experiences many times where they go above and beyont tomake sure I eas 110% pleas ed. Just go there,, both locations are great,, exceed expectations at reasonable price!,"}
{"text":"I love this place and I think it's hilarious all these dumb people getting take out and bitching about the amount of food they get.  NEWS FLASH PEOPLE: TAKE OUT CONTAINERS ARE THE SAME SIZE EVERYWHERE!!  Go to the restaurant and order a dish and you will have food for a few meals! It's amazing how that works...  The food quality is amazing, and the portions are amazing IN THE RESTAURANT. If you get food to go the chefs have to pack food into a container.   The apps are awesome and fresh, good size. The entrees are large and have plenty of veg and meat (depending what you order). We frequent this place (both take-out and dine-in), and when we go there we get twice as much food as when we take out. HOWEVER this is not the restaurants fault, it's just the way it goes when you take food out of a restaurant.   Eat at the restaurant and enjoy great service and even better food. Take out and expect less food but great food."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Slow service, slow food and cold chicken. We've been here a couple times before and never had this much of a problem. I even asked for salt and pepper and never got it. Wow"}
{"text":"Got a hair in our crab puffs, a big disgusting hair. They didn't do anything but take that part off of the bill. Not sure if there were anymore hairs."}
{"text":"Flo's has the most delicious food and absolute great service. Their lunch specials are fantastic and prices are great, I come here for lunch periodically through the week and on the weekend for dinner and i have not once been disappointed with service or food quality. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great gem in Tempe. The food is flavorful and plentiful. Service is great and the servers are well trained.  Don't order too much. Lots of plates are big enough to share. And if you do get too much, it is yummier the next day.  Get there for Happy Hour. Great drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"'Delish food at reasonable prices' -pretty generous with their portions. - reasonably nice ambiance - Tom Yum soup was good... a lil on the saltier side...but lots for the price -basil chicken was great -kimchi was fantastic and again lots of it 4 the price    Associating the word 'Confusion' with a restaurant is somewhat rare for me...but my experience definitely deserves it.. The place was a lil hard to find in the the big strip mall- confusion 1 We were still waiting on the entree when the waitress comes and packs the leftover appetizers- confusion 2 We get the check before the entree comes...lol  - confusion 3"}
{"text":"A group of us came here for dinner and I was not a big fan! The portion sizes were small and the price we paid was big. The food wasn't tasty at all. I think Pei Wei's food is a lot flavorful and the food portions are better. We spent close to $80.00 for dinner for five. The service was very good because the restaurant was empty during dinner."}
{"text":"My sister invited us to have dinner with her and my brother-in-law at Flo's in the Promenade, Saturday evening at 5:30, so we could get their early bird 1/2 price appetizers!  It was a 30 minute drive for us.  I poured over at least 70 or 80 reviews that afternoon.  When it comes to oriental food there is a distinct separation into Americanized and Authentic in our population, you need to be aware of what group you belong to. Flo's is definitely for the Americanized palate:(  a group we don't belong to.  But family is family so along we went. We ordered 5 Appetizers: #1-Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings (Seasoned with spicy chile salt and tossed with bell peppers, fresh chiles, and onions) and told there would be a 15 -20 minute wait, no problem.  Also ordered #2-Thai Style Calamari & Chiles. (Breaded calamari seasoned with chile-pepper salt, diced bell peppers, green onions, and a hint of lime). Next #3-Chinese Lettuce Wraps. (Chicken in a sweet hoisin sauce with water chestnuts, mushrooms, and green onions.  #4-Pot Stickers (Pork), and #5-Singapore Chicken Satay (Skewers of tender chicken breast drenched in a rich peanut sauce). The chicken appeared to be ground and somewhat gritty but the peanut sauce was tasty and worth 2 1/2 stars. #1 & 2 were listed as spicy, - NOT, no heat at all!  The wings were crispy and had a nice flavor, alone I'd give them a 4 and the Calamari were quite tough and chewy, cut in long thick strips and had a \"fishy\" taste and no spicy taste I'd give a 1.  Also decided to order their Chinese Hot & Sour Soup - A thick and hearty soup made from an old village recipe with chicken, shrimp, tofu, mushrooms, eggs, cilantro, and green onions.  that had rated several rave reviews, I wonder which soup they really had.  No hint of spice, a strange aftertaste and a rather large portion that didn't taste like any other hot & sour soup we have had. Rated it a 1.  The lettuce wraps had no water chestnut crunch and little flavor and rated a 2.  The pot stickers were somewhat dry but with fair flavor and their accompanying dip needed help, gave them a 2 1/2 as I would also give the Lettuce wraps.  The restaurant environment was attractive, appeared clean with rather dim lighting.  Service was fairly good and friendly.  My bill was almost $30 without the tip. I've had better and will not return."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch after shopping. I would recommend the orange chicken, it's not spicy like the menu indicates. My wife enjoyed her vegetable fried rice, not greasy and came with a large portion of vegetables.   Service was excellent. Timely and responsive. Clean establishment."}
{"text":"Frank Lloyd Wright location always seems busy, so I guess it is a neighborhood favorite. Service is friendly and attentive. Cocktail menu is inventive.  The food though.... hmmmn.  Nothing was authentically Chinese. This place is American Chinese Food. Dishes are thickly coated in sugary orange-colored sauces, and everything tasted the same. We did not even bring our leftovers home. Gloppy, goooy disappointment.  I really wanted to like this place, as it is convenient for us. We've given it a couple of chances, in case we had just been there on an off night or ordered the wrong things for our tastes.  Rats! Our search continues for Chinese food in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is a good Chinese place compared to other places of similar caliber.  I like almost everything here except for the scallops and mushrooms.  The scallops tasted rancid and were overlooked.  The curry is good and so is everything else.   Service was slow and not attentive."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend for an after work dinner outing. I was looking forward to a calorie conscious meal as I'd researched their menu online a few days before. That's not what I got.  The service was good. I was politely greeted seated quickly. While I waited for my friend and water and the menus were promptly delivered. Our table was right in front of the door and I contemplated asking for a new table but realized it was the only table for two in sight. Yes, I could have asked, but whatever. It was a table.   For dinner I asked for the teriyaki chicken skewers and a side salad with the ginger dressing on the side as I like to control the amount of dressing that I have. The salad arrived first, but dressing was NOT on the side. I looked around for our waiter but he was no where in sight. Oh dang it...I'll just eat it as is.  The dressing was pretty yummy and the salad was fresh.   Then came our meal (which were on the appetizer menu) and I knew that the chicken was not grilled but fried. Oh cr*p. I didn't ask how it was prepared. My bad. It was a pretty hefty portion with about 6 skewers. Not bad.  Then I took a bite and wow...not what I expected at all. The chicken was \"bouncy\" and not tender and juicy. It was fried (or broiled) I think and pretty oily. The teriyaki sauce was very, very salty and I knew my rings would be tight the next day. (I was right.)     On the other hand, my friend's dish looked amazing! She had the lettuce wraps and they looked super fresh.  She said it was yummy and practically ate the whole thing. Again, the portion was sizable.   As another Yelper mentioned, It was pretty loud and at times I couldn't hear what my friend was saying. The noise was distracting.   Since I was looking OUT of the restaurant toward the door, I didn't really take in the interior decor so can't comment there.    I'm not sure I'll be back. I was not wow'ed and to me Chicken Teriyaki is super simple to make. I could probably do better at home. ;)"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Flo's when this location was across the street. Todays lunch was a big disappointment.  The salad is now very small. The $9.95 lunch special is half the size than it use to be. With rice serve on the plate that covers 70% of it.  It took forever to order and the same with paying the bill. One server seems to be handling the entire restaurant.   This will no longer be our favorite place to go.... To many other places just as good for the same  price and you can leave full."}
{"text":"Suffering from a serious case of inconsistency, Flo's has alternately provided some of the best and worst chinese in NoSco. Their lunch special is a steal, with fried wontons, salad with some of my favorite dressing, and a healthy portion of many of your standard offerings.  Unfortunately, the quality often lacks. Breaded chicken used in a variety of dishes including sweet and sour chicken, etc., is almost always too dry to swallow without significant liquid assistance.  Speaking of assistance, good luck getting any. Wait staff is on par with McDonalds in terms of skill and experience. Then there are the BUGS.  Only a mass-production assembly line approach to running a restaurant kitchen can result in the number of undesirable additions that can be found at Flo's.  If you are repeat customer, it's not a matter of if, but when, you will experience the same nauseating discoveries."}
{"text":"Mike the manager should be fired! Zero customer service and 100% lack of intelligence. I ordered a house salad, and when I picked it up i was being charged for a $15 salad that had oranges and walnuts and who knows what else..and when I mentioned it to him that it was not what I ordered, his response was \"just take the stuff you don't like out\" once again I said, \"why am I being charged for a more expensive salad that I did NOT ORDER? I ordered a house salad!\"  He once again suggested I take everything I don't like out, but that id still have to pay the price of the more expensive salad because it's what they do!   After insisting for 10min, that he had my order wrong, he went to the back and brought back another salad, and said it was the house salad, when I checked, I saw walnuts...it looked like he poked through my salad and just took crap out. I was soon frustrated that I just wanted to get out and pay.    Now paying was another ordeal! I was also picking up an order for my coworker. When I called and placed the order I had made it very clear that it was to be separate checks...well not with mike at the register!  He suggested that my coworker pay the full bill on her card, because he didn't want to split the check!  That was another 10min of dealing with this idiot!  I mean I have never had such an experience with a more basic individual...Flo's I hope you can do a better job at hiring your managers. This guy didn't even understand basic customer service...sad part is that not once did he try remedy the situation...he was just straight out lazy and disrespectful! I feel bad for the girl in training standing next to him...as a manager you have to lead by example...sad to say this was not the case!"}
{"text":"I walked in and it was clean. The service was good. We ordered take out. Portion size was good. Food was good. I got the spicy orange chicken which was tasty, the shrimp chow mien, which was awesome and bumbling which were bomb.  I will go again next time I want some Asian fusion"}
{"text":"Probably our regular dinner hangout whenever we crave Asian cuisine. Their Dan Dan noodles is the best! Period.  Service is good. Just would be nicer is servers weren't rushing around and if they could smile a bit. Of our 7 trips as of yet, we had a server who smiled just once.  Ambience is nice, a bit on the dark side (no pun intended) as compared to their Scottsdale Rd location.  Very kind in terms of correcting their mistakes and humble too.  Love this location. We always recommend this location."}
{"text":"I do love this place. And not just because one of the hottest waitresses I've ever seen in my life works there. (I still haven't mustered the courage to say much more than \"Please\" and \"thank you\" to her, for the record).   I can't think of a Chinese place that serves tastier hot and sour soup. I love the free salad with peanut sauce dressing that comes as soon as you sit down. I love the flat $7 price for almost every single entree no matter how elaborate it may be. Granted, this is yet another cafeteria-style restaurant with seating for 8 million people, which I normally detest and mark points off for. But if the food is good enough to compensate, I'm willing to overlook it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! Fresh food with lots of flavor. Great happy hour specials, good ambiance and friendly staff. Food arrives pretty quickly and turnaround time at the bar is very fast. You won't end up waiting on your drink order, even when it's packed."}
{"text":"Dear Flo, your sure know how to make a girl scarf her dinner! It's all because of your delicious Chinese cuisine that I just can't help but pile on my plate! How it took me this long to visit Flo's, I will never know. However, now that I've had a bite...err plateful of food, I will frequent this restaurant over and over again.   Let me start with the atmosphere. This is North Scottsdale suburbs at its finest. You'll find a lot of families here eating, but there's also a bar with plenty of TVs that make it perfect for an Adult's Night Out as well. This is not a dive. No, this restaurant is decorated with trendy Asian decor. The staff is incredibly friendly as well. We went on a Thursday night in the middle of the summer, so I'm sure that can attest to the fact that we were able to sit down without a wait at 8:00 PM at night, but there's plenty of seating so I'm sure even a small wait doesn't last long.   Now on to the blissful food. Two words: Katsu Chicken. I could eat the entire plate myself but I did share. It's breaded chicken that's so tender, you don't need a knife to cut it. The breaded chicken is bathed in a sweet Teriyaki sauce and sits upon a heap of egg fried rice. It's delightfully delicious upon every bite. So much so that I went back to seconds (and thirds). Secondly, the Sweet and Sour chicken. It's pretty much your standard Sweet & Sour chicken but it's good, tender and worth a second helping as well! Their lettuce wraps were juicy and a great starter. We didn't get dessert, but I noticed chocolate won tons and banana spring rolls which sounded pretty sensational as well!   This is solid Asian dining and worth the visit if you're in the area (or even if you're not!)"}
{"text":"The service was great.... love the happy hour. I recommend the chicken lettuce wraps and the fried rice... the chicken pad Thai wasn't that good to me especially since I'm used to the small noodles, but overall I would go back"}
{"text":"Good food, although I wish they'd not used so much soy sauce.  Also, since I ordered an appetizer and a main dish, I wish they had given me a chance to finish the appetizer before bringing out the main dish. It wasn't that crowded; they didn't need to bustle me out in order to turn the table.   Good service, though."}
{"text":"This place is very good. For the price, you're getting good quality Chinese/Thai food. They have a good menu with lots of soups and appetizers. Only downside is food takes quite a while when they're busy, and the wait staff don't seem to watch each other's tables."}
{"text":"Very blah. No flavors stood out at all. Actually if you ask me the biggest flavor was salt. I kept asking for more refills of water to wash my salt down. They would fill the water up with 90 percent ice, refill again please. The kid serving me, I doubt he could even spell Chinese or for that matter find China on a map.   Poor food, poor service. Its almost like they copied Pei Wei and did an extremely poor job of copying a mediocre restaurant.  Look for this one to close down in 12 months."}
{"text":"My favorite Tempe locale for some taste you food. Snuck in before happy hour and they were great about getting two beer orders and some appetizers. Great service.  Eclectic patrons with happy servers. Gonna keep going here."}
{"text":"So Santa was very generous this past Xmas.. he left me loads of yummy eats gift cards including Flo's Asian Kitchen.. Ive been here once before and while I liked it, thought that the lacking service and typical dishes found pretty much anywhere else would stop me from coming back. Well can't disappoint Santa!  I'm not a fan of the dumbed down over sugared, over salted Americanized fluff supposed Chinese places that have been serving in our lovely urban sprawl for some time.. THAT place starts with initials. Flo's offers many different regional specialties done very well. For instance the Calamari with Chile's was just plain awesome.. simple and fresh, crusted calamari with chile's, no sauce, sugar, goop or glop.. just simple and delicious.  The chicken curry skewers we're so tender and flavorful with the additional taste of coconut milk.. oh how I heart coconut milk!   Service was good and the Tiger beers were nice and cold.. will certainly return to Flo's soon! Also to be mentioned, while this place gets busy not nearly the noise level of Thompson Peak.. actually very intimate considering the size of the dining room.   Thank you Santa.. I love you!"}
{"text":"Flo's has a very modern ambiance so I was excited to come and try their authentic Oriental food. I was a little disappointed for a few reasons:  - They don't allow fried rice as a side dish during the lunch special (no subs) - The appetizers tasted like they were frozen and fried up instead of made from scratch - Kung Pao Chicken tasted very much like star anise (licorice basically) which is not how it's advertised  A plus- they give you an assortment of different sauces with all of the food brought out, which is awesome because I like to dip my food.  Probably won't go back, but a good place to go if you want a quick and cheap lunch with a big group."}
{"text":"Went for lunch after reading review.  Ordered take out - yellow curry chicken.  It was very solid.  Good amount of food and a good value.  I'd go back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times now since it opened and Tempe and it just seems to keep getting better and better.  Now they have outside seating which is even better!  I have been turning all my co-workers on to Flo's and they have all like it.  The ambience is awesome!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great place for happy hour if you enjoy appetizers which is just about 2 pages from their menu and not to mention drink specials. The food is fresh and tasty,  service is phenomenal, and sometimes, you get to meet Flo as she checks to make sure her customers are satisfied.  I don't eat meat so I opt for their shrimp kabobs, veggie spring rolls, and potstickers.  Top it off with a $3.00 sake and I am one happy gal!"}
{"text":"Please don't waste money here.. Very disappointed after reading the reviews. If Flo's is the best Chinese food in AZ i am the king of France. Bad food we didn't even eat it.. Simply couldn't eat the food. Another Scottsdale fail."}
{"text":"I've been in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area for so long, and I'm kicking myself for not visiting Flo's more often.  The food is reasonably priced and ever so tasty!  I went recently with my girlfriend and enjoyed getting two dishes that we both shared.    The service was good as our server was attentive to us.  We also didn't have a wait upon our arrival.  The food also arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  We looked through the menu, which does a great job highlighting vegetarian, gluten free, and/or spicy dishes.    We shared a garlic chicken dish, which instead of zucchini, mushrooms, and onions, we swapped the mushrooms and onions for broccoli and extra zucchini.  We then also ordered sweet and sour chicken, which is breaded chicken with pineapple, bell peppers, and onion glazed with sweet sauce.  Both dishes were great on the evening we visited as well as made great leftovers as together we only ate half the food we ordered.    I also wish to note that Flo's participates in the Elite Restaurants program (https://www.elite-restaurants.com) where we can visit so many restaurants and receive buy one, get one free discounts twice (per restaurant).  This was the first time we had used the promotion at Flo's.  After using it at several other restaurants in the program, Flo's was the first restaurant where all the servers were fully knowledgeable about the program.  I was impressed!"}
{"text":"I've gotten advertisements in my mail for this place and was curious about trying. I don't think I will ever go again. There was hardly anyone there when we went inside at lunchtime. The manager seemed nonchalant about us when we walked in. At least he wasn't ignoring us but the overall sterile atmosphere contributed to my overall not-super feeling about the restaurant. Our waiter, although he was very nice, could have been a newbie and when asked of different dishes didn't really give too much detail that gave indication of the dish. Granted he probably didn't know enough about Asian cuisine to comment but it would help in the future. The less than mediocre appetizer of 4 potstickers (too doughy and not browned enough) for $7.50 gave us a clue to what was to come for our main dishes. In my mind I gave them the benefit of the doubt that it's hard to find good potstickers anywhere. But our main dishes were around the same identity...less than mediocre with flavors of inauthenticity that one would appreciate if they shopped at the Fry's \"Asian\" section. The garlic eggplant that I ordered was hardly seasoned while the other dishes that the others got were too Salty or lacked sauce where it needed (ie in the Curry) to soak up the rice.   The waiter was trying to be nice and ask us if we wanted anything from the appetizer list to rectify our doughy potstickers. We declined. Ok so I thought he was done being new and trying to help the situation but later he came way too fast to ask about the check and made us feel rushed (not good). The manager came over as well to ask about our food and while I think he sensed our disappointment he didn't inquire further which in a restaurant like this where there were hardly any people dining and servers galore, there should be time for them to come and really learn about a diner's experience. That never happened. Hmm well I'm getting tired of writing negative things so will wrap it up.   If you are interested in going to a higher end Panda Express or Pei Wei than this is your place by don't expect to get authentic and tasty food for the price you pay. I understand it's hard to get good \"Asian fusion\" or even figure out what Asian fusion food is but Flo's please don't call it that because of dishes like \"Pad Thai\" and \"Vindaloo\" that you have on the menu. Call it that when you have unique Asian inspired dishes and people who care about your experience."}
{"text":"First, the good news. Good location, plenty of parking, nice staff.  Unfortunately, the bad news. Worst Chinese food ever had. Every dish we had was worst than the prior dish. No further details needed. I honestly don't know how folks keep frequenting the place or perhaps it was a bad night there. I don't think every gave a one star rating before.  In any event, won't be going there again and forewarning to others."}
{"text":"it doesn't matter what i have ordered this is the best chinese food i have ever ordered. i just wished i have had this food before."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in arizona :)   I recommend the lettuce wraps to start.   Our favorite entrees 9/10:  spicy cinnamon shrimp: simple amazing flavor which I've never imagined could be achieved.   9/10: vindoloom curry, which a wonderful sweet and spicy pair of Indian and Chinese flavor.   8/10: chicken Pad thia - great veggies and large noodles   Michael was a great delight, respectful and swift :)"}
{"text":"Great food, loud ambiance. Servers have been very attentive! Very often a wait but the food is worth it. The Salt and Pepper chicken wings are awesome, as is the Beef Chow Fun and the always delicious Spicy Ginger and Onion Beef!"}
{"text":"Had the Tom yum soup and lemon chicken..... The soup was so far from original with a huge bowl and so lemony I had to put water and ice to fix it myself...the huge bowl only had 3 shrimps but had plenty of mushrooms.  The lemon chicken  was enjoyable as well as the service from the bartender.  The place has a calm atmosphere but I will probably try another place and come back once more before I completely forget about it."}
{"text":"Flo's food quality and the staff are as good as ever.  We were one of Flo's original customers more than 12 years ago and loved the freshness and flavor of her menu items.  Having returned to Scottsdale after living out of state for a number of years, we had to return and have found the food quality and the staff to be a good as ever.  Flo is still there to say hello and insure the quality is as good as ever.  The menu has new items as well as the selections we had enjoyed for years. This is a must in Scottsdale and is much better than other well know national Chinese food chains."}
{"text":"I really like Flo's. I always try to hit the one in North Scottsdale when I'm in the area so I was ecstatic that they opened a location in Tempe.   The whole family went tonight. The restaurant is spacious and beautifully appointed and the food was very good, as always. But the service was appalling.  My husband and I took separate cars so I arrived before him with two of our children. When we walked in, we were told they didn't have a table. Just like that, \"We don't have a table right now\". No offer to put me on the waiting list, nothing. I had to prompt the guy as to what happened next. He said to take a seat, they were cleaning a table. Then, a girl followed up and told me it would be 10 minutes because they were clearing a table.   We got seated in fairly short order though, so that was OK. Our server took awhile to come over. Now, understandably, my husband and other daughter weren't there yet, so I didn't get too fussed. He took our drink orders and said he'd stop back to get our order when our party arrived. My husband and daughter got there and sat down.  The waiter walked by us about 5 times and didn't even acknowledge that he saw the rest of our party. He then came over, plunked my drink on the table and walked away again, without asking my husband and daughter if they wanted a drink. Then he proceeded to walk past us about 5 more times.  He finally came over to take our order. He didn't listen to my husband and put in the wrong order.  Our food came out very quickly but we had to send my husband's back.   So, the short version is, food was good, service was bad. I'm sure I'll be back but this was disappointing."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Asian food I've ever had (granted, I've never been to Asia so I leave off one star for that, but still, it's amazing). This is the location to go to, the others aren't as good in my opinion. I have friends that come into town just to eat here. It's really worth the visit."}
{"text":"Have you heard the NPR episode where the seafood industry has a problem mislabeling the species of seafood sold and served? The story goes on to discuss an urban myth that pig bungholes are repurposed and sold as calamari strips. I want to tell you; it's not an urban myth. I had them yesterday at Flo's new restaurant in Tempe. Flo's calamari appetizer was as chewy, inelastic, and muscular as you might imagine a pig's bunghole to be. Even my dog, who likes a nice chewy rawhide occasionally, only ate one and left the remainder in her bowl. I avoided the garbage disposal for fear the motor would burn up trying to macerate the tough over-processed protein.  The entrée we shared was the chicken fried rice. It was nothing special. We also shared a 16 oz. bottle of Tsing Tao Beer, my favorite, but we wondered when we paid the $33.00 tab if we'll ever be back. And it's a shame, Flo's location is very convenient to where we live.  I have to add, our server Bethany, was charming and attentive to our requests. For Bethany, we give the extra star otherwise Flo's only deserves one star."}
{"text":"Good place for take out! My work orders food from here sometimes and it's always good. Yesterday was my first time ordering it on my own before! My sister got lo mein noodles and I got Thai yellow curry. We both liked our food! My curry was a bit bland and I think I'll get the tofu steamed the next time, but overall good stuff! My sisters food was a little pricey but the portions were huge so no complaints, I'll definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"The food taste like Pei Wei but Flo's doesn't make you stand in line to order which I appreciate.  My girlfriend and I came here for lunch and it was packed but the service was lightning fast.  I must say I was pretty impressed with how efficiently the staff works together to serve the customers and quickly turn over tables.  I had chicken curry and the sauce was delicious, the chicken was tender and the veggies were crisp.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty unique concept. Their food selection seems authentic which I like. They have Thai food, Vietnamese well pho, and Chinese. I like their food selections. We came here for happy which is from 3-7pm. Very affordable and huge portions! The place is clean and spacious! This place is good for family dinners as well!!!"}
{"text":"Love flos food is always good. Had to stop going due to gluten allergy but was recently informed that they offer gluten free options so may have to start coming back to try them"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Asian restaurants. I like that it has a slick modern look with an open dining area. Mostly I love the crab puffs, which are some of the best I've ever eaten. I have never ordered anything that I haven't enjoyed. The wait staff is always friendly and helpful. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The best Asian food I have ever had! I will never go to PF Chang's again!!! Wonder atmosphere and the food was divine!!!!"}
{"text":"Uneven experience at Flo's tonight for our party of five (including two children). Potstickers and veggie spring rolls were terrific and the kids' meals came out promptly. On the downside, the egg flower soup with shrimp lacked flavor. A dash of low sodium soy sauce could not revive the concoction. The main courses, chicken pad Thai and spicy ginger beef were excellent. However, there was a bizarre service issue where the servers could not be bothered to clear the plates as the main courses arrived. Picture dishes from two appetizers, one soup for four ... And trying to fit on another two major entrees without clearing all those empties. I never experienced this type of plate-clearing confusion. Comically, they sent ONE solitary server to clear all of these plates. To sum it up, great food, poor soup, bizarre service."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Happy hour is so flipping cheap for such great drinks/service/food. An absolute must!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here last night. I hate to say I can't remember the servers name but he was very efficient. He could teach a class on how to be a good server without overdoing it :-).   Food was good, lot's of flavor. I had the ginger beef... could have been a bit spicier, but that's a personal matter easily resolved with some chili paste."}
{"text":"Sadly, a new menu was implemented recently. Prices have increased by about a third across the board. Many of our favorite appetizer/happy hour items have been omitted. The food is still good, but the casual environment does not justify the new high prices. It is no longer my favorite Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Be careful when you order take out. We ordered takeout on Monday Sept. 1 .  I was told we should be at the restaurant at 5:40PM to pick up my order. I waited 25 minutes.  The order was not ready till 6:05PM.   No comment was made from the staff anD no complimentary desert or anything was offered. I think this is BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR FLO'S."}
{"text":"This by far is our favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley.  Always good food and service along with reasonable pricing.  Both locations are excellent."}
{"text":"I probably order food for pickup here once a month. It's consistently good.  The sweet and sour chicken and the pepper bacon shrimp are my favorites.  It's nice to see the owner here all the time keeping an eye on things."}
{"text":"We used to love this place but today's visit proves that things change and not always for the best.  In their infinite wisdom they have Changed their menu and removed some of our favorite things, most notably is the calamari appetizer we always ordered.  They also decided to remove all descriptions from the menu so happy guessing. (The printer must charge by the letter). Also, they serve the same dish multiple ways, one way for dinner and another way for lunch.  I ordered the yellow curry chicken lunch. It was served dry, when I asked for the sauce I was told that they serve the dinner size in a bowl with the sauce, not the lunch.  So my curry is altered for what purpose?   I think I'm done with flo's after this sad visit."}
{"text":"Went to Flos in tempe for lunch Saturday.  I have gone there at least 6 or 7 times on Saturdays for their lunch which has been very reasonable and the food decent in the past.  This past Saturday the restaurant was busy and the food terrible.  My wife's chicken curry had very old dried out pieces of chicken and her rice was dried out, terrible.  I ordered a shrimp pad thai and it was really bad,  nothing like real pad thai, pretty much egg noodles (large and flat) with a couple of shrimp, bad flavor and again, dried out and old rice.  They add some fried won tons which are really just a waste.  I guess I won't return."}
{"text":"This is the best of all Flo's restaurants.    It is probably one of our favorite places to eat in Scottsdale.    It isn't unusual to see Flo walking around the restaurant checking on the customers.   The menu is very reasonably priced and they have great lunch specials!   If you sign up for their email promotions, they have great deals on gift cards - 20% off and sometimes even 50% off.     If you haven't been here, definitely try it and it is well worth the wait if there is one."}
{"text":"I was just here for lunch today and I got the spicy beef with ginger. Very good but I asked for it to be extra spicy as their version of spicy and my very of spicy is very different. Sigh... Oh well, I at least have leftovers and can add a few extra spices to get it as spicy as I like."}
{"text":"The girls and I decided to stop by for lunch. I read reviews and determined it was promising. Till This day my girlfriend still gives me crap for picking this place. Food was mediocre, service was slow and my friends dish looked like someone threw it up into her plate. If your looking to try to new places and don't really mind the quality of you're experience I would say try this place."}
{"text":"Gave this place two tries. The service staff is friendly, but the food is not good at all. Hot and sour and wonton soups are bland at best. I tried shrimp and pine nuts and Mongolian beef, and I would not recommend either. A friend ordered teriyaki chicken which looked great but did not taste good. My guess is that the cooks are not tasting the food before serving to check quality. A disappointing experience for a restaurant I had high hopes for."}
{"text":"Yes it is noisy,but the food is great. Much much better than the corner chinese!  Hands on management insures great service. The chef knows his way around his kitchen for sure. Well worth the $$$ and delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was priced right.  It was real loud inside and hard to hear from across the table. Waiter was nice and helpful. My only other comment would be that they wait by your table to take your dish whether you were done eating or not. That irritated me tremendously."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Flos for the first time Friday night. Ordered the wonton soup & the chicken wings. We LOVED the wings, so delicious and worth the wait. I also ordered the chicken vindaloo but had it with beef instead, it was a bit too sweet to my liking and not enough spicy. So I took it home and made it a bit more spicy. Overall everything was good."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out there is a Flo's in Tempe.  I was a frequent visitor of the Scottsdale locations throughout high school.   Half off drinks and appetizer's for happy hour, you can't get better than that!  Their crab puffs are still some of the best around."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! Our waters stayed filled and the happy hour deals are amazing! This is a place gives quality everything and they are not over priced. The manager is so sweet and our server was extremely patient with my million questions. This was my first time at Flo's and it we not be my last! #WeAreNotSorryWeOrderedTheCalamari"}
{"text":"Out of all of the Flo's locations, this is the one I've frequented the most over the past 3 years of living in the Valley.  I've seen the menu change here and there, but I have to say, I've never had a bad meal at Flo's.  I met my friend Melanie H for dinner this evening and we really enjoyed our meal... we had great service - our waters stayed filled throughout the time we were there, and our food was served promptly. Our server checked on us several times as well.  We started with vegetable pot stickers and requested that they come steamed.  They were delicious! Next, we shared 'Indian Curry Vegetables' (I ordered it with shrimp) and Indian Vindaloo Chicken.  Both were extremely tasty - fresh veggies, chicken, and shrimp in really flavorful sauces with just the right amount of spice.  The curry vegetable dish came with broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, and long beans.  The chicken dish had tomatoes and onions. We also had steamed white rice.  Note to Flo: We were both disappointed that you took the Vietnamese Spring Rolls off of the menu and I miss the days of the green curry dish with calamari. One more thing - the chicken corn soup that you serve at the DC Ranch location should be offered at the others as well - I love that soup!  Fortune cookies came along with the check and we both were happy with our fortunes.  The bill didn't break the bank either.  See you again soon, Flo!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I would still give you 5 stars based on the things that I have personally ordered, but today I took a bite of my better half's Dan Dan Noodles and wasn't terribly impressed. I ordered the Black Pepper Chicken and it was perfection...again. (easily one of my favorites there), but the Dan Dan Noodles were really blah. My suggestion...either make it as awesome as your other dishes, or take it off the menu, life is too short for you to have something sub-par on your impressive menu and it makes me sad that this was his first impression of your restaurant. *sniffle* *sigh* so I'm taking one star away."}
{"text":"Had a really great meal here tonight and a fabulous server that let me customize it.  I ordered the veggie stir fry and asked that no sugar be added to the sauce.  In addition, in lieu of rice, they steamed cabbage for me  My family thinks I am high maintenance but I really appreciate the restaurant working with me!    Several members of our party had sweet and sour chicken and that was delish as well!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Loud atmosphere, staff lacks experience in proper service. If your desperate to eat and are ok with average food, poor atmosphere and a staff that lacks experience then your good to go."}
{"text":"If you are looking for \"authentic\" Asian food, look somewhere else, however Flo's provide tasty \"fusion\" type of cuisine served in a friendly, attentive environment.  My mother and I did have to ask for more spice to our food since it tended to be more of this slightly spicy/sweet combo taste.  My mother sent her order back after they offered to make her a more spicy dish, which they offered graciously.  My rating is based upon customer service, taste (which again is not authentic, but fusion), and the attentive/friendly staff.  Also the decor was tasteful."}
{"text":"Front cashier did make make a good first impression. Server \"Katie\" was a gem. Energetic, knowledgable, patient and friendly. Food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Excellent place for Saturday/Sunday brunch!! The ambience is nice and the food here is great!!"}
{"text":"I eat here for lunch or dinner at least once a week. Lunch specials and happy hour are killer and the food is always on point. The bartenders (Dave and Kierstin to be specific) are top notch and highly attentive.   You can tell this is a locals spot because the staff remembers who you are and are always welcoming. If you on the fringe of wanting to try this staple, just do it. It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Flo's is our new happy hour spot!  We stopped by on Friday night around 6p for dinner. To our surprise, their happy hour runs from 3-7p. Also to our surprise, it's a pretty amazing deal - 1/2 off all alcohol & apps!  We ordered lettuce cups, wontons, spring rolls & a couple beers. The food was delicious & they were all large portions.  Our total for 2 beers + 4 apps = $17.   Flo made her presence known which I also found refreshing. Everyone was friendly & the food was top notch; you go girl!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago for lunch with my daughter's family, my daughter, her husband and 2 teen-aged daughter's. Everyone loved their food and service was excellent. Decided to come back today on Mother's Day for dinner with same group plus my husband this time. Everyone was very pleased with their meals once again! Service great as well. They will serve both white and brown rice for the asking. All of us had leftovers from our plates to take home. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone even if you have a fussy eater. One of my granddaughters had sweet-sour chicken...she was very pleased. The other one had egg/foo Yung and was pleased also. We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Quick service!  Probably my fav Asian place! HH is great as well.  Nice and clean as well!"}
{"text":"I like many types of Asian food and I noticed Flo's while grabbing a burger next door at The Habit a few weeks previous.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in and given a choice of a table or the bar.  Being just a few minutes after opening the place was empty.  I chose a high top in the bar area.  Was given a menu and my drink order was taken right away.  I must not eat out in bar areas often, that was the first time I had seen iced tea dispensed from a bar gun.  When my drink came my salad came with it and the waitress took my order. The food came out in a reasonable time.  My waitress checked on me several times. The food was good.  I will definitely be back.  Other than the decor the place reminded me of the now shuttered Zang Asian Bistro in Glendale that I went to often.  Right down to the dressing on the salad.  Flo's also has many more items on the menu.  I also like that they have lunch pricing, and I assume portions, on most of their menu items."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite on Saturday after shopping-this place is conveniently located at the Pavillions Shopping Center on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. I hate to compare Scottsdale Chinese food to my native San Francisco, but I just can't help myself. The pork potstickers were only okay-pretty greasy when they came out from the kitchen. The combination fried rice was overcooked and didn't taste freshly made at all. The single dish we ordered-Chicken with green beans was freshly made but the disappointing other dishes but a damper on the over all meal. Still looking for good Chinese in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Flo's has been on our restaurant list for too long...because we finally ate there tonight after reading lots of Yelp reviews. Service: attentive & well paced. Cocktails & Beer good. Menu: very large & varied...from Indian to Thai to Chinese to....made our choices very difficult. Started with the Crispy Fried Shrimp Wontons - nice sauces, good fry but too much shrimp & needed seasoning....but that doesn't mean we didn't eat all of them. Entrees: Beef Lemongrass & Rice Noodle and Lemon Pepper Chicken - good flavors but again would have been much better with fundamental seasoning (salt). It's a 'keeper.'"}
{"text":"First, the modern concept and set up is cool!  Makes you feel welcome and a clean feel to it too.  I found my friends there were 1 hour before me and happy already from happy hour.  LOL!  OH, they have a great HH menu for drinks and food.  The service was OK.  We needed to keep flagging down our server for refills, additional orders, etc.  Since I was only stopping for the ornament exchange, I ordered the Singapore Chicken Satay and Chicken Pot Stickers.   I got my satay and never got my chicken pot stickers.  Had to grab the servers attention to make sure the chicken pot stickers were removed from my check.  TOO bad the chicken satay was very good, and I left hungry!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Flo's in Scottsdale today for the first time. What a wonderful experience. From our greeting, to our waitress, to the salad, entree, and very fresh fortune cookie-it was all first class. No issues of any type to report. The house made salad dressing is to die for as was the pork and eggplant dish that we shared. If you are anywhere near this restaurant, you really need to give it a try. With half price apps and half price drinks, happy hour seems to be wonderful too. If you like Asian food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Ask for Corey behind the bar and get some great food and happy hour 3-7 all day everyday. Classy new spot but still have PBR on draft."}
{"text":"I have tried this place about 6-8 times since moving here in 2002 because others rave about it, and I keep thinking it will be different but every time I seem to get something bland. Ordered some sort of peanut-spicy chicken thing and it was basically flavorless and the onions were raw. Are they in a hurry or something? \"Chicken\" tasted thin and rubbery. Place was SUPER noisy - do NOT go on a date there! Ling and Loiue's on Shea and 96th blows this place out of the water in every category."}
{"text":"I've tried several of their dishes at this Flo's location and they've been all good.  What keeps me coming back again and again is their hot and sour soup~ made fresh, full of flavor with large pieces of white chicken meat and large shrimps.  Usually, when I am feeling under the weather, like today, I stop by Flo's for a quick \"pick me up\" of their aromatic and delicious hot and sour soup and after consuming the large bowl, big enough for four people, I felt better and left a happy customer~ along with a to go order of wonton soup to nurse my coughing throat for later on in the day."}
{"text":"Tip: Come on Saturday to get the cheaper lunch specials! The meals listed are actually $7.95, but only on Saturday day time - not in evenings and not on Sundays. That is at least what our waiter told us.   Parking: This is a busy strip mall area, like the entire valley, but parking is easy to find.   Service: Quick and thorough. The service staff are on top of it and are usually quite quick to take orders.   Food: I have been here twice. The mixed vegetables are crisp and cooked just right. They could use a bit of spice. During the lunch special, they provided little salads with a tasty ginger dressing. It was a nice light crisp dish with all the creamy / hot foods. The potstickers were good as well."}
{"text":"First timer..found via the Urban Spoon App. Service was excellent, Im going to say that right off the bat. The rush had come and gone and by the time we sat down it was 5 til 7pm. We didnt even know about the HH that was about to expire but our server let us know we had 5 minutes left and told us the HH deals ..which was a nice surprise since she could have said nothing and we would have been none the wiser. My date and I were chatting up a storm and the server was great she just kept checking on us but wasnt hovering or rushing us to place our order.   We started with the pan fried pot stickers and they were excellent, no complaints. I ordered the spicy cinnamon shrimp.. just because it seemed so unique and it was great. The texture was great, not soggy. I just couldnt really tell if it was spicy because I was 2 cherry vodka/diet cokes in.. but the cinnamon was apparent..you could taste it on the inhale.. when you take a bite, but no cinnamon taste left behind. It was like a magic trick in your mouth.. lol  I would definitely go back to try other dishes not even a question that needs an answer."}
{"text":"Flo's is good! Gourmet? Well, okay...I agree that it is predictable, but I enjoyed what I had (NO LIES!). Their brunch/lunch specials are sort of affordable. At least, the dishes are cheaper, eh? The Dan Dan noodles, crab rangoons (although I think they call them puffs here), and we got a spicy beef plate...I forgot the name. NERDS! It's not really authentic by any means, but it still filled me up and was tasty.   There are these crispy won ton chips that they bring out, too. And a small salad.   I know probably none of this is actually good for you -- health-wise, even the salad drenched in that orange dressing (which I personally really dug). Maybe it's just that I was really hungry when I went? Isn't that why you're supposed to go out to eat? To NOT be hungry at the end of it?   Mmhmmm. Flo's. Comfort American-Chinese food. For me."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying their food was decent. I had the sweet and sour chicken and I thought it was pretty good but nothing special.   The reason for the 2 star review is their customer service. The other day I came into Flo's with 3 of my co-workers. We were greeted by a very kind hostess and immediately seated. We sat down and waited all of 30 seconds before our waiter came over and took our drink orders. He must have run to the kitchen and back because next thing we know, we all have drinks and he's taking our meal orders.  I bet you are wondering where the problem is....just wait, this is where it gets good. From that point on the waiter never came back to our table. Someone else delivered the food, we had to flag down a different waiter when the entire table was waiting for a refill. Worst of all, I had to chase down our waiter to get our check so that we wouldn't be late getting back to work. I literally had to race after him (in heels might I add) and I followed him all the way to the kitchen and then grabbed him as soon as he exited.  I've never been in a situation where I had to ask someone to bring us the check. Usually that's when the waiter is most on top of things.   Food: 7/10 Service: 2/10  Will I come back? I think I'll give them another chance, but this better not be consistent behavior."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but it doesn't warrant dealing with the dining room noise or the lack of parking.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkJvxLssz5E"}
{"text":"Take out service is excellent.  We have been long time customers of Flo's and will continue to buy from them."}
{"text":"Sorry Flo, but I won't be coming back to this location..  The food was totally uninspired & bland as can be.  It's amazing that  even though it's the same restaurant, the Flo's on Thompson Peak is SO much better!  This is what we had:  1) wonton soup:  watered down tasteless broth, HUGE slivers of pork which was kinda gross and wontons that were 99%skin and 1% meat  2) hot & sour soup:  it was just OKay  3) mapo tofu:   salty, starchy, &  sauce had NO flavor 4) pepper beef:  tasteless and again salty.  It tasted like soy sauce and not much of anything else.  The 2 stars are for the service and the miso salad dressing.  it was good but the herbal vinegarette at TP location is SO much better!!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with any of Flo's entrees and thus everything I've tasted was good, just not great.  I am grateful that it's nearby because it 'hits the spot' when my chinese food craving kicks in and you can find me there at least a couple times a week.  My food is usually carry-out, but I have to comment on the superior service everytime I've eaten there.  The servers are soooo attentive:  1) always checking to see if everything's okay 2) clearing empty plates 3) refilling beverages, etc...  I'll admit I'm obsessed with the herbal vinegarette salad dressing.  I think it's the 'perfect' dressing to any salad and my only gripe is I wish it was sold it bottles.  I would buy it.  The fried wings appetizer is also tasty and they're perfectly fried and presented on a bed of chopped lettuce, onions, and jalapenos.  It's salty, spicy, crunchy, and there's alot of flavors going on.  $8 is pricey for 8 pieces, but it's worth going during HH when it's 1/2 off.  Oh yeah, the sweet/sour soup is really good too.  $5 for a huge container is a great deal!  3 stars for the food +1 for the service!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty busy the night we went, which usually bodes well. The open space is nice when you don't like to be on top of the table that's next to you. I like that you can get food from all Asian cultures, but it's not the best in town. The price was fair. The service was fair. The taste was fair. I feel like there are many better choices in town. Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"Happy Hour everyday is awesome (half off most apps and drinks!). Entrees are ok, last few orders vegetable to meat ratio was a little high (I like more meat!). Can get expensive if eating outside of happy hour hours."}
{"text":"Went here based on a personal recommendation.  Service was really good.  Note that the menu and prices on Yelp are not correct with the actual prices.  Ordered the Pot Stickers - Chicken/Pork/Vegetables $7.50.   It comes with 4 of them....arg.  Rather expensive little things.  Nothing remarkable about them.  For my main entry I ordered: Crispy & Spicy Chicken $12.95 (9.95) Breaded, butterflied chicken breasts smothered in a Sichuan red chile garlic sauce.  The chicken looked like Katsu that was sliced.  Also came with what I thought was a bowl of soup.  But now that I am reading this, I am guessing it was the Red Chile Garlic Sauce that I was supposed to smother it in?    It really wasn't that Crispy or Spicy.  The salad dressing on the salad was really good.  He said it was a house made and had Miso in it."}
{"text":"I get takeout from here all the time. I only get the sweet n sour chicken! I could use more pineapple!! It's the best part! Great food! Seems like all white meat chicken. Very flavorful!!"}
{"text":"I love Flos Tempe location.  I don't love every single dish on the menu, but, there are enough dishes on the menu that I crave, that I go to Flos two or three times a week.  I love the moo goo gai pan, the orange chicken, the honey beef, the mongolian beef and few other of the main dishes.  The lettuce wraps, salt & pepper chicken wings, and spring rolls are great appetizers.  Flos will gladly alter any dish to your liking, like adding mixed vegetables, or putting a different sauce on your dish. At lunch, they serve a complementary salad with fancy greens and a tasty dressing.  This location has a wonderful group of servers, that not only provide excellent food service, but are some of the most friendly and happy servers that I have encountered in the valley.  I am so happy Flos moved into my neighborhood.  Is it perfect...no...no restaurant in the Phoenix metro area is, but I am a pretty fussy eater, and the food and service here keeps me coming back, again and again."}
{"text":"Value. When you factor in cost and quality this is 5 star all the way. Hot and sour soup lives up to the hype of previous yelpers. We tried a variety of appetizers, the aforementioned soup and the twice cooked pork (it has bacon that's enough said)."}
{"text":"I went to Flo's restaurant on a recommendation from a co-worker and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the broccoli beef and it was amazing--such wonderful flavor with the sauce, thinly sliced beef and various vegetables--on my way home I started eating some and I could not stop. I really wanted to turn around, go back, and get another order (smile). Next time that I go I will have to sit in versus getting take out as it looks like a very nice and relaxing atmosphere. The staff that I did interact with were very friendly and open to changing the soy based sauce that usually comes with the broccoli beef to a white sauce (I am allergic to soy)  I hope that in the near future that Flo will open up another restaurant--hopefully in Old town Scottsdale or central Phoenix, so those of us who live in Mesa, Tempe, and south of North Scottsdale can have quicker access to Flo's amazing food!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a good friend who said this was the best place to go too for Asian/Chinese food. The atmosphere is nice. I like the way it is decorated but I will say that for the prices, I wish the seating was a tad more intimate. It had more of a fast food seating arrangement. It is very clean and nice though. For appetizers, we ordered the crab puffs and the salt & pepper wings. Fyi, the wings take a minimum of 20 mins, our main entree came out first. For our main dish, we ordered the crispy honey beef. This was by far AAAAHMAZING. Awesome flavor. Also got an order of bbq pork fried rice. The rice was just okay. The pork needed more flavor. We also ordered a drink and beer. Before tip, our total was about $69.  For what we ordered, I don't think it was worth that price but it won't keep us from eating there again. Also, it would have been nice to have our food boxed up instead of ourselves having to do it....I would recommend this to others."}
{"text":"Of all of the Flo's restaurants in the Valley, the McDowell Mountain Village location is my favorite. It's located on the northeast corner in the same plaza as AJ's, so parking can be a bit trying during peak eating times.  I've never been disappointed with the food at Flo's. It's easily the best affordable Chinese food here and even rivals some of the best places in the Bay area. My personal favorite is the lemon pepper chicken, which is delicately tart. The kung pao is also pretty fantastic. No matter where you go on the menu, it's hard to go wrong here.  One of the best things about Flo's is that you can substitute tofu into any of the menu items, or ratchet up the spiciness with no fuss by the staff. It's refreshing that they're so accommodating.  Prices are normally pretty reasonable, especially given what you're getting. Dinner is in the $10-15 range for the most part. However, on Saturdays, Flo's runs a crazy lunch special from noon to three: $5 lunch! For five little Washingtons, you get a nommy house salad (with a tart herb dressing), crackalicious won tons and your choice of entree with rice. Even at lunch portions, it's still a good amount of food. I typically take half home with me. The rest of the week, most of the lunch menu is $7, which is still a steal. Happy hour (half priced drinks and appetizers) is on weekday afternoons from three to seven.  There is typically a short wait for lunch at Flo's, but service is quick and efficient. The restaurant is always clean, and although it can get noisy at lunchtime, I have never found it difficult to carry on a conversation here."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I've tried many Asian style restaurants and this is by far one of the best. Service was outstanding and food was phenomenal. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Vegetable potstickers and Veggies and Tofu are amazing for a vegetarian!! Really good lunch specials and HH. Just wish there was one located in Central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I usually get the yellow curry chicken through DoorDash, and I love it the only thing I hate about the delivery is that it comes in a  plastic bowl and the food is super hot, I hate using plastic since it's unhealthy I wish you guys use paper bowls like Most restaurants use for soup instead, thank you."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite places to go for Chinese! The food is fresh and delicious! There are also a few veggie options which is great for me! The flavored are good and the staff is great!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite place to have Asian food. We are always content with Singapore noodles. We have had plenty of their dishes and always delish. One thing I may change is their fried rice. Recently we have seen and tasted that it's a bit different. It lacks the brownness of it  which is probably the soy sauce and egg. Other than that it's delicious."}
{"text":"Headed here for lunch with a co-worker the other day, and I must say we were pleasantly surprised by the sleek and modern interior of this place! We were greeted as soon as we walked in and seated by the window.  Their lunch menu and dinner menu are one and the same, however, they offer smaller versions of their dinner options with a lunch price in ()s next to the regular dinner price. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken with white rice. The sweet and sour sauce was exactly what I was looking for flavor wise (sometimes you can get a sauce that's too runny and just doesn't coat the meal...not the case here!). The chicken was cooked perfectly.   The waitress was quick to refill an empty class and to check on us regularly. She was obliging to separate our checks for us and had us checked out and on our way pretty quickly for a lunch hour.  Overall: A We will definitely be back for a lunch!"}
{"text":"Good flavors, fast service.  Love their green curry.  Great happy hour where appetizers are 1/2 off the reg price.  The downside is that most of the appetizers are deep fried.  I like lunch better than dinner as they offer a nice salad with the meal."}
{"text":"I give it 3/5 because the food is ok.  It's not bad but at the same time it's not good.  To be honest I'd probably rather just go to Panda Express.  It's cheaper and has the same averagish take on the cuisine."}
{"text":"Good food!  Good service!   Great choices!  What else could you want.   Flo's GOT it.  Wonderful addition to the great city of Tempe.   Try it."}
{"text":"I have passed Flo's a bunch of times while driving and always wondered if it was any good. So I finally decided to do some Yelp investigating and based on the reviews and how close it is to our house, we decided to try it. We ordered for take-out on a Sunday night. The girl who took our order over the phone was very friendly, and the food was ready quickly, in about 20 minutes. We ordered the Summer Rolls, which were fresh and delicious, the Kung Pao Chicken which came with fresh vegetables in a very tasty and just the right amount of spicy sauce, as well as the Orange Chicken. The orange chicken comes fried (wish I had read the menu more carefully) and the sauce for the orange chicken comes on the side, so you can use as much or as little as you'd like. Overall everything was really delicious, and didn't feel heavy. I'm sure we will be visiting Flo's again for some more yummy take-out!"}
{"text":"I have gotten take out 2 times since they opened. My boyfriend and I have shared the shrimp pad thai, orange chicken, sweet and sour soup, crab wontons and kung pao chicken. Everything was great! I loved the pad thai the most. We live a mile or so away so it's close and easy to get to. Friendly staff. I didn't give it 5 only because I haven't received actual \"service\" in the restaurant... yet."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch here. I got the fried rice with brown rice, was delicious! The place is spacious and modern."}
{"text":"Flo's \"Asian\" Kitchen...?  Where is the Asian food?  The food had no flavor whatsoever!  It makes the ultra gross chain restaurant PF Changs seem like Asian food in my opinion.  Not to mention this \"Asian\" restaurant is extremely overpriced!  I know this is Scottsdale, but come on.  Makes me miss California more and more..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super flavorful and reasonable. We normally do take out. A must try..."}
{"text":"Nice happy hour! I love the fried chicken wings with minced garlic and jalapeno peppers. Green Chicken Curry is also very yummy!"}
{"text":"I've had better........from the frozen aisle at frys"}
{"text":"Best sizzling rice soup and crab puffs anywhere! Love this place."}
{"text":"I know everyone and their grandmother has already reviewed this place, so I will be quick.  I love this place.  Yes it is more \"western\" chinese.  But it is light years better than PF changs, or other chain type places.  Every time we have been going we get something different from the menu and have yet to have anything less than a fantastic meal.  It is also very affordable. Plenty of things on the menu for under $10 per plate.  Me likey..."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Flo's for a while now. Today I finally got my chance, but it was so disappointing! I ordered the Panko Chicken Salad and the greens look like a bagged salad from the grocery store (supposed to be mixed greens, but more like iceberg with 3 pieces of baby romaine). It had shredded carrots and NO walnuts (menu description says walnuts). The chicken is just OK. Honestly, this is a McDonald's quality salad for $9.50. I also ordered the edamame appetizer and the pods are slick with oil. Yuck! I am extremely disappointed, will not be returning to Flo's. Bummer, since the menu sounds so good- but obviously is not."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this location for some time and it did not disappoint!  Very fresh & good. We have Mogolian beef & peanut chicken in a mild spicy sauce. Good..."}
{"text":"The food was awsome, you gotta try the soup!  I only wish there were more items on the menu.  It would also be nice to have a location closer to me.  PV Mall area....."}
{"text":"This restaurant is getting one star for taking items off the menu i personally liked most. Very disappointing because now, many of the items can be ordered at a fast food chinese restaurant at half the cost. The thai style calamari with chilies was delicious and so was the beef with cashew. But you will not know because these items are no longer served."}
{"text":"As a gluten free vegetarian, it is quit a job finding meals as my family and I dine out. Here at Flos I had the pad Thai with a few adjustments, making it fully veggie approved. It was and by far has been the best, most tasteful and fresh Pad Thai I've ever had. The triple chocolate moose was freshly made and truly worth the calories. Definitely a five star value! Not to mention with four people in my party making dining, 11 entrees and four alcoholic beverages our bill was only $86!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Stephanie! She really knows how to make her guests feel welcome. We've also had super service from Jenny on previous visits, be sure to ask for one of those girls! We had the wonton soup and a huge spread of the happy hour appetizers, everything was perfect and larger portions than we're used to for happy hour specials, great job and thanks again Steph!"}
{"text":"Flo's used to be better.     Our meals yesterday were good, but not remarkable.  (Kung Pao Chicken and Thai Style Green Curry Chicken.)   The salad dressing is too sweet and the server was haphazard when applying it (My husband's was underdressed and when we asked if he could have some more she squirted a bunch more on both our salads....and mine was already overdressed.)    I ate there a month ago and once again, just sort of average.  With the exception of the soup (Spicy Thai Coconut), which was very good, the rest of the meal was relatively bland.  And the lunch portions are way too pricey for the small size you get.  Re service, we sat at the bar.   It wasn't busy, but trying to get our bartender's eye contact to order, to ask for chopsticks, to ask for something to give our meal some flavor....good luck.   She really exhibited no interest in our dining experience at all.  And speaking of the bar, for a tiny glass of average Sauvingnon Blanc it was $10...and in one of those cheap, small catering type glasses.  The wine selection is tiny and overpriced.  And if you still decide to go, parking is not easy to find for the entire shopping center.  This place is in between a 2 and a 3.  I wish I could still recommend it, but I can't."}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite. I personally love the vegetarian tofu wrap. I love this restaurant because they never mess up your order and you can get everything customized, also their is free unlimited rice unlike many other restaurants."}
{"text":"Hands Down the BEST Happy Hour in Town!!! Our favorites are the wings and crab puffs. My son loves the honey chicken and we always share a bowl of the sizzling rice soup! The staff is super attentive and you can tell they run a tight ship. You can always find Flo walking around talking to guests. It's super clean too which I personally appreciate because I work in this business!! This place will NOT disappoint it's the best asian cuisine around!!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in town. The salt and pepper chicken wings, eggplant, sizzling rice soup, chow fun and especially the lettuce wraps are all amazing!  If you want authentic Chinese food with friendly service this is the place!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Flos for many years and have always loved it but the last few times its been really off. One fav was always the Thai Coconut Soup until the last couple of visits, it's now completely lacking that amazing flavor we expected. We asked at both these visits if they had changed the recipe or something 'No' was the answer & the manager had no idea what was different and really was not concerned. Also the dishes keep getting smaller & pricier, I love veggies but as an example when it's called a chicken dish shouldn't it be about the chicken? Also we liked it when we would go for lunch it was served on platters like the dinner menu, now you get a small lunch plate with a single serving and half the plate is filled with a large ball of formed rice & the small plate of dry lettuce just doesn't cut it either. I am so disappointed to say we won't be returning any time soon-when twice bitten, twice shy."}
{"text":"After an awesome trip to Taliesen West, my two friends and I found Flo's. The decor is a little strange, with some \"cultural\" posters, such as a series of pictures of women standing next to a plane during wartime, interspersed with poorly designed posters such as one of the word \"stir-fry\" superimposed onto a picture of raw broccoli.  The menu is your typical pan-Asian menu, so I had low hopes, but the food turned out really great! I got the Thai Basil Chicken, which came with lots of vegetables (which I like) and a scrumptious side salad. I also thought the wonton chips that came with each lunch order were delightfully quirky and delicious. All in all, it was a fun experience, made even better by the great company I had."}
{"text":"It's honestly quite difficult to ever find a nice Chinese restaurant. Usually, it's a fast food or quick service kind of place - I'm so glad this isn't another one of those!  Flos is actually a very nice, clean restaurant with delicious food. The times I have gone, it has always been fairly busy but never loud. Everything on their menu is amazing! Their Mongolian beef is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  The remodel has helped with the noise level.  High quality food in a nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"After recommendations from several family members, my husband and I decided to try Flo's while vacationing in AZ. They have an awesome happy hour from 3-7 daily. I would suggest trying the lettuce wraps and crab puffs.. so good!"}
{"text":"They have excellent food, but the portions are average to small and the pricing is expensive for this type of cuisine. I'm not sure I would go again compared to other options I have for chinese food. The staff was average as well. I'd like to see better staff and bigger portions in the future if I were to go again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great thing going for it -- everything is cooked to order. I love their Tom Yum soup. Not very authentic, but it's flavorful with a slight spiciness. I'm not a fan of seafood, so they make it for me with chicken instead of shrimp.  Their noodle dishes are delicious and remember, it's all to order. So if you want to customize your meal, go ahead!  This place is crazy busy in the evenings, especially weekend evenings. It's even worse in the cooler months -- to the point where I don't go there for dinner unless it's summertime."}
{"text":"Love the hot and sour soup.  That and a bowl of rice hits the spot.  Staff and service is mediocre but always come back for that soup."}
{"text":"Chinese fusion food. Reasonable price for lunch or dinner. The food came very quickly  and the staffs were nice and friendly.  About the flavor??? I just haven't get  that the kick flavor yet."}
{"text":"First timer. The service was good. We enjoyed the Asian pork and pot stickers. Very reasonably priced. Will have to go back to try more items. It was different than the normal Asian tastes, I liked it."}
{"text":"Flo's is our go to place for takeout but recently we went in for a sit down dinner and it was such a disappointment. The service was the worst. Slow, inattentive, didn't listen or deliver items requested, and took forever to take our initial order and bring our drinks. The food was good but because of the service I will not be returning unless it's for takeout."}
{"text":"Flo's is good place for a business lunch. They have good size portions and a salad and fried chips are included.  I like the Pine Nut Shrimp with broccoli or the Thai Basil Chicken. Service is quick and friendly enough. You can order takeout too."}
{"text":"Went in with some family for lunch today. Loved that all lunch entrees on the menu were only $7.95 for large portions. Food was pretty good, and the service was really excellent."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this location 5 stars but due to the service I last received when introducing my mother to this place it gets 3.   Previously I had a great experience with a large group of friends one happy hour after work, but fast forward to when I brought my mother here it was a completely different experience.  The food hands down is delish and you can beat 1/2 off any drink and 1/2 appetizers (with exception to a couple that are not included).   The place was actually quite dead when I made my last visit, which struck me odd that our server was so poor at serving us. We actually had about 4-5 different servicers drop by our table since our waiter went M.I.A. on multiple occasions. Come to find out he's outside on his phone and I found him chatting it up with a table that had shown up some time after us. Later I found out there was a co-worker at that table and apparently that gets you priority service.  Anywho - if you're looking for an awesome happy hour with great prices and delicious food check this place out but be prepared it's a hit or miss experience with the service."}
{"text":"Flo's has amazing Asian food, it's definitely my favorite in the Valley!! My favorite dish is shrimp with asparagus on brown rice. There are so many selections to choose from and served hot, fresh, and quickly. Lunch prices are great and served with a delicious salad. Happy Hour is a must served 3-7p throughout the Resturant, great drinks and appetizers to enjoy at terrific prices. The servers are all excellent and several of them have worked at Flo's for many years. 5 Stars for sure..."}
{"text":"Flo has managed to create a mini Chinese restaurant empire here in the Valley.  Maybe it's the funky atmosphere, maybe it's her personality ... it doesn't seem to have spawned from the food.  Although it's good, it's nothing spectacular... especially for the price.  But then again, where do you go for inspired gourmet Chinese that rises above the rest?"}
{"text":"My friends said this Asian-y place was started by the wife of the guy who started PF Chang's. I don't know about that as I already have apprehensions of \"modern\" Chinese food (or rather, non-authentic).  I had the panfried noodles with \"everything\" (beef, shrimp, chicken and calamari). It was tasty though salty and a tad bit greasy.  I also liked our veggie lettuce wraps and fried calamari appetizers.  And who serves sake in a Chinese place?  Oh wait, this is the \"Asian Kitchen.\"  Okay, fine.  I love sake.  Service was really good.  I actually saw a Chinese family eating merrily here while talking loudly.  Hey, it was like I was almost home in L.A."}
{"text":"We used to go here a lot a few years back, when a long line before 12 pm on Saturdays was the norm. Quite a bit has changed, but I still appreciate their lunch special. It's just a little disappointing to see the major changes implemented over the years (fond memories of the unlimited chips in the middle of each table). The salad that comes with the lunch special has the best dressing I've tried. We normally order the following dishes: - Shrimp w/ Long Beans: not much shrimp to be found, would appreciate more sauce; note: this is spicy unless you request otherwise - Cashew Chicken: I appreciate that you can order this the \"old style\" aka with breaded chicken; a good portion for lunch - Beef Chow Fun: actually quite authentic, but the noodles seemed unusually chewy (undercooked?) - Pad Thai: decent"}
{"text":"Happy to have a good Asian place in the neighborhood! I cannot believe this used to be McDonald's. They did a really amazing job making the place over. For a former fast food joint stuck with another ol' strip mall they managed to make this place feel inviting yet open and airy.  Okay, on to the food. My boyfriend and I started out our meal with the regular lettuce wraps. They were really good. I could have just eaten these as my meal. We would have liked a little more sauce for them though - mostly because the sauce added so much flavor to it.   For our entrees I went with a chicken and veggies dish - it was a slight variation on the chicken and veggie stir fry and my boyfriend got sweet & sour chicken. The portions were huge - we definitely could have shared. And I liked that they gave us both white and brown rice - perfect for a little mix and match. The ingredients tasted fresh and the dishes were very flavorful. Overall we really enjoyed our meal. And then we enjoyed it the next day as leftovers, too.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've visited Flo's a few times this past year and consider their food ok. However my last visit I tried their shrimp and asparagus which left me with food poisoning and sick for a complete day with stomach cramps. I don't believe after being this sick that I will ever return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Took a date and had decided to sit on the porch. The inside seemed a little too loud for us, and the porch is very pleasant with a high fence and outdoor heaters to keep us comfortable.   I had the green curry and will order it again. She had orange chicken and seemed to enjoy it. We also shared crab rangoon and they were fine, nothing crazy, but still good.   The hostess was very pleasant and our waiter was a gentleman. We enjoyed our night and have talked about revisiting."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with the quality, quantity, and cleanliness of Flos. The menu offers spicy Thai, spicy Chinese, mild dishes as well as gluten free items. They have fleshly brewed China mist black tea which is mild and delicious. Happy Hour is 3-7pm every day. Saturday lunch special is $6. I had the pad Thai which spicy but not \"hot spicy\". They have a full bar and deserts. Casual dinning and comfortable seating, no booths. Friendly service from the hostess to our server. I will be back and highly recommend Flos to everyone. Try them out you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Take out or eat in .. both are amazing. Fabulous bartenders! Love the menu. Love the food."}
{"text":"First, the service was excellent. My waitress could not have been more attentive or capable. Tried the Hot and Sour soup, Dumplings and Dan Dan noodles. Soup was good, slightly above average. Shu Mai Dumplings were average, I see the same or better at any Dim Sum. The Dan Dan noodles were completely disappointing and I sent them back after 2 bites. The chicken and sauce were tasty, but the noodles had the flavor and consistency of cheap, overcooked spaghetti noodles from a generic box. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Chinese food. I like other Asian types of cuisine, but Chinese food always seems monotonous and uninspired.  Flo's changed that. We went to the Thompson Peak/Pass restaurant on a recommendation by an Uber driver.  Beautiful place. Attentive but not over bearing staff. The young lady getting our water really lined me out on some of the menu items I was curious about.  Hot and sour soup was great, with shrimp and a lot of other great stuff. Perfect for sharing.  Salt and pepper wings were plump, crispy and still juicy.  We got the twice cooked pork( xtra spicy, duh) and the spicy ginger onion beef(I think that's what it was, basically super duper Mongolian beef) and roast pork fried rice.  DAYUMMMM!!! Hadn't had Twice cooked pork in a while, amazing. Veggies done to perfection, meat was tender, not rubbery. Great spice but not overpowering.  The super Mongolian beef was a revelation. I don't ever get beef from Chinese restaurants because the beef is usually super Lowe grade and it chews like bubble gum. Not this stuff. Great cuts, juicy, and again very tender without being too chewy.  Flo came out and met with us also came back to make sure we were satisfied(to say the least).  An overall excellent experience. I'm always coming back here whenever I'm in Phoenix, hell anywhere in the southwest. Worth driving out a bit for a complete dining experience.  Flo threw in a complimentary desert which unmanned to find room for.  Oh yeah, and the true test of any Chinese food is the leftovers. Later that night after a few margaritas, I destroyed any and all leftovers. So excellent. Even the fortune cookies were great.  Thank you Flo!!!!"}
{"text":"Our monthly group dinner.  I ate at one of their locations in Scottsdale.  We order several dishes and shared:  Beef with Wide noodles, Lettuce Wrap, Fried Tofu & vegetables, Katsu Chicken, Salt & Pepper Calamari, Singapore Chicken Satay, Spicy Ginger Onion Beef & Twice Cooked Pork.  It was all good, tasty and well prepared.  Our waitress was very quick, accommodating and friendly.  I wouldn't mind coming here again, when in the area."}
{"text":"DON'T COME HERE IF YOU WANT REAL, AUTHENTIC ASIAN FOOD!  This place is full of people who use forks. We should have walked out right when we stepped in and realized that there were no Asian diners. Just a panda express disguised as fancier dine in. Chicken was dry and costs over ten bucks, our \"calamari\" was a joke as well. A couple of the employees were slacking, it was awkward seeing a couple of them flirt and not pay attention to their tables. They obviously don't care about looking and acting professional. Go to panda express and save your money and your taste buds if you want fake Chinese. Also, it's not exactly the fact that it was so far from authentic, because I like and tolerate fake Asian food just as much as the next college student, but this was just overpriced shit. It was one of those rare bad food experiences where you regret even walking in. There is absolutely nothing worse than paying for a horrible meal."}
{"text":"I use to work here.... My favorite dishes on the menu are: hot and sour soup, yakisoba noddles, orange chicken, red curry and Mongolian style beef.    Happy hours are good for appetizers I recommended the wings and calamari ask for a side of salad dressing to dip with-----amazing!  Saturday lunches are 5 dollars for any dish includes a salad. Be aware service and time can take a little longer since the kitchen is backed up with in house and to go orders.   This place has good food and fast service."}
{"text":"Service was slow and fairly apathetic, I'd expect a little better on a Sunday afternoon.  I'd heard plenty about Flo's, mostly good, so I was excited to try it. The salad that came before lunch was cafeteria-grade iceberg. Dressing was tasty, though. My entree was shrimp with bacon, cabbage, and tomato. It tasted okay, nothing special though.  The reason I'm giving them one star, though, is because something in this meal (I'm assuming shrimp) made me sick, and I'm still paying for it two days later. Far from impressed, and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"If I would have written this review after our first time ordering here I would have given it a 5 star review. Our first time we ordered pork and shrimp dumplings, twice cooked pork, and their onion and ginger beef--all of which were absolutely delicious. We liked it so much that we came back a couple of days later and ordered the same thing. Tonight we decided to try something new and quickly discovered that we had made a mistake. We started with the calamari (half off on happy hour) which was chewy, bland and did not come with sauce. Then we had had the salt and pepper chicken wings and they were good, but not amazing. My boyfriend ordered the hot and sour soup which is his favorite; it was a bit weird tasting and not in a good way. I ordered a Thai beef and noodle plate as my entree. We sent it back. The dish had a good flavor profile, but it was very dry--\"drier than the Sahara Desert\" as my boyfriend put it. All in all, I am super disappointed because we were so excited about this place after our first visit. We will still be back, but we will be sticking to our original order. On a side note, happy hour from 3-7pm here is a great deal. All drinks and appetizers are half off. I really enjoyed my Flo-Ha cocktail."}
{"text":"Flos has some decent chinese at an affordable price. It is located in a parking lot with yogurtology, AJs, and chipotle. Yogurtology is a great place for desert after!   I get the teriyaki beef here. It is pretty good, although I don't like it that hot. It is sometimes soggy. I'm not really a fan of the other options on the menu (but don't worry, I'm picky. The menu is huge!)  The reason it gets a 4 is because it has the best deal in the valley. Come here for a 5 dollar lunch on a Saturday! Great deal and it gets very busy. On Mondays and Tuesdays, you can get lunch prices at dinner time as well!"}
{"text":"Maybe not the most romantic restaurant for dinner, but offers an amazing lunch and has great drink offers from the quaint, little bar.  Very good Phad Thai and Spicy Basil Chicken...  Have a Flo's Bloody Mary while you are there.  Great food!"}
{"text":"Oh Flo's how do I love thee....Let me count the ways  1. Quickly seated from a sweet hostess  2. Fast & Friendly service!!  3. Those little heavenly wanton chips that I dip in Flo's out of this world sweet and sour sauce  4. THE FREAKEN GARDEN SALAD! For the love of all things holy! I wish they bottled and sold the salad dressing! Its crack people! Crack on a salad! Cant.Get.Enough.  5. The lunch size sweet and sour chicken is great! If you are really hungry its just enough, or not so hungry its good for a little lunch tomorrow! And the chicken is crisp yet light, and its not drenched in sauce, its just perfectly sauced...always!   I heart you Flo's, I really do. I haven't even taken the hubs here yet, you are like my  little secret! I need to take the hubs here, he will love it and most likely leave me to make out with the salad dressing, cause its that amazing!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the Valley. As others have said, salad dressing is addictive as IS available to take home in containers. Shrimp dishes are outstanding with large, plump high quality pieces of shrimp. I have never had even an average dish here. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I am so picky with chinese food because it never tastes fresh, but Flo's is always fresh. I drive from Anthem to eat here. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G and by far the BEST, most delicious and fresh Asian food I have ever had.  We so enjoyed this dinner while visiting my P's in Scottsdale.  If I could have, I would have dined here every day, every meal, as often as they would let me come.  It was crowded for dinner, as I would expect, but we were seated within about 15 minutes nestled amongst families, date night'ers and soloists.  We started with the wings - get them, get two orders.  They were crazy good, no breading just crispy hot tasty chicken wings very meaty.  The egg drop soup was out of this world and I am not a soup person - I have had egg drop soup a dozen or so times in my life and this one takes the cake hands down served in a giant crock.  We ordered chicken fried rice which was white and fresh and we could not get enough, chicken satay with a wonderful peanut curry sauce and lettuce wraps to graze on for about an hour during our stay.  We enjoyed every smidgen of food here - every single item was made with such quality ingredients and served in abundance as we had plenty to take home.  I love this place.  I wish they had one in Chicago.  FLO'S PLEASE COME TO CHICAGO, WE WILL EAT YOU SO MUCH!!! OH!  There is a happy hour half off certain dishes and cocktails in the late afternoon - everything but one item we ordered was on special pricing.  Dudes, we had two orders of wings, a crock of soup for four, chicken satay, two orders of lettuce wraps, chicken fried rice for like 40 bucks!!  Go, please go. Go now."}
{"text":"This is one of my old standbys.  Great for takeout or eating there.  Its never that crowded and the food is awesome.  My absolute favorite is the green curry chicken.  If I could be sure no one saw me, I would lick the bowl!  The japanese teppanyaki beef is also wonderful.  The meet is super tender and the noodles are delish.  The malaysian cashew beef and lettuce wraps are also great choices.  I like the varitey they offer, lots of different asian flavors.  I'm moving farther away soon and am bummed it won't be right down the street.  But I'll still make the trip!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Happy Hour.. 3-7pm, 1/2 off ALL booze and ALL Apps.. For about 40 bones, you can come here with a partner, and you can do some pretty good damage through their menu.. Highlights are the Calamari, and the Dumplings.. It feels a touch drab and sparce inside, and it lacks an energy, but the food is really good.."}
{"text":"Good location  Don't ask for spicy as they will make it very spicy Standard Asian food"}
{"text":"Have been to Flo's for over 7 years, the food is fresh, the service fast and the prices fantastic, try their happy hour, Flo is an amazing women with the golden touch! love love love the food!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for happy hour, Great drink and food specials, We had lettuce wraps and dumplings and other goodies, Everything was cheap and good, Spent very little and had lunch the next day! The dirnks were really good, The place is nice, upscale, Has been packed both times we went."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and had to try it. Was not disappointed. Really nice upscale restaurant, manager who cares about your experience...which is important. And then, GOOD food. Good flavors, not too greasy like you get sometimes. The hot and sour soup was exceptional, it has shrimp in it so ask if you don't eat seafood. The Kung Pao chicken was truly the best I have had in AZ, not piled with sauce like most places, just chicken and peppers, lots of flavor. Will try again for sure."}
{"text":"I live right across the street from this place and have been wanting to try it out. Today, my boyfriend and I finally had the chance to go.  Long story short,  food was pretty good but service was lacking so much so we would only go back if it was for takeout.  We were one of two tables in the restaurant and served by Stephanie.  The staff,  manager included, were more concerned eating their lunch in a group at the back of the restaurant to be focused on how ours (the guest) was.  Working in the restaurant industry I know what good attentive service looks like and this place needs some work."}
{"text":"Flos is amazing. The food is cheap, good, and quick. The service is great. See Stephanie in the bar."}
{"text":"Food was hot and good. Prices were reasonable and the service was excellent.  The lemon chicken and pepper chicken with a Hugh bowl of egg drop soup."}
{"text":"Wow - exceptional service...and I mean from everyone!!  Had to pull the owner aside just to share it with him.  The food was also pretty damn goood too.    I have to single out one gal, who I had asked the preverbal quintessential question to...\" so what's good\"?  And she didn't skip a beat - she actually qualified me first and then followed up with ale great suggestions.  I love it when a server has the willingness and confidence to do this - it simply shows thy care both about the establishment they work for and the customer.  She was a rock star.  I didn't catch her name but she was awesome!!     Thanks for great lunch experience - I'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Finally - a place to get decent real Asian food in Scottsdale!  So many Asian restaurants here are just bland and don't even attempt to balance the flavors.  There are many great items to choose from here.  The menu covers several different Asian cuisines."}
{"text":"Flos never fails! I've been going here ever since I was little. Even the salad they give you before your meal is delicious! Their dressing is amazing! I usually get the orange chicken (maybe it's sweet and sour chicken I can't remember) but recently I tried the coconut curry soup and OMG it's to die for! Perfect blend of sweet and spicy! I love Flos!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times since it is right down the street from where the husband and I work. We've also brought the in-laws here, since they really like Pei Wei. I would have to say that this place is similar to Pei Wei, but with way more varieties and less of a \"chain\" feel.   When you dine here, you receive a salad with a tasty dressing and some wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce to start. Then you have many protein and vegetable options. When with the in-laws, we usually order way too much food, but it's all really tasty and makes good leftovers. The house fried rice is delicious - it comes with beef, chicken, and shrimp! The sweet and sour shrimp technically isn't on the menu, but they can bread anything and dunk it in sauce. S&S Shrimp is one of the father-in-law's favorite. The beef and broccoli is tasty - the broccoli tastes fresh and the beef is really tender. The sister-in-law and I really enjoy the beef teppanyaki - which is wide flour noodles with onions and beef. The sauce is delicious and again the beef is tender. The husband always orders a different dish, never deciding on just one favorite. On Saturdays, the lunch items are all $5, which is a great deal. If you are ever in the area, definitely give Flo's a try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"In a word, this place is a success at providing american (quasi Chinese food.)  Not authentic, not so good at all.  I didn't base this review on a single visit.  I wasted (3) visits confirming the that the food is sub-par for anyone pursuing authentic great tasting, Chinese food.  You can't even determine what region of China that they are attempting to reproduce.  They really should try and at least keep up with PF Changs, or Panda Express."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh, good ol' Flo's Chinese Restaurant.  I love this place.  I was introduced to this place when I first moved to AZ  seven years ago by my friend Anushka.  This quickly became my favorite happy hour place when I lived in the area.  Just a quick drink with a friend always ended up to be a late night at Flo's.  It is an easy place to hang out at the bar.  Great drinks and food specials.  The service was great, decor is nice and the food is yummy!    I always enjoy coming back here.  Also, ya can't go wrong with the $5.00 lunch specials on Saturdays!    Check it out!"}
{"text":"BAd service.  Bad food.  I have tried Flo's multiple times and it is an all around fail.  Too bad. This city needs good fried rice and such"}
{"text":"If you're hungry for Asian, by all means go. It's a nice restaurant with a very pleasant staff.   The food is good and tasted fresh. The Coconut Curry Soup is good, the pad thai was not among the best I've had but it was satisfying... The Tom Yun Gun was way too salty."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed Flo's for many years. It is clean, food is fresh, prices are reasonable, and wait staff is friendly and efficient. Lunches come with a nice small salad. You can choose from white or brown rice without an up charge. They do a great job with their shrimp dishes. Saturday lunches or happy hour prices are great value. Love the Chinese lettuce cups (and they also offer Thai version which my neighbor prefers).  This is not super authentic Asian cooking, but is geared to American tastes, imo. If you really like spicy, be sure to let your server know."}
{"text":"I love happy hour!  They have half off appetizers that are delicious, hot and fresh.  One of my favorites are the buns filled with BBQ pork.  Their lettuce wraps are as good as PF Changs and their soups are delicious."}
{"text":"flos is probably one of my favorite places for takeout. Its also very nice restaurant. They have a mixture of Chinese and thai food. They're teriyaki chicken is delicious.. and i love their egg rolls, they're so light. I been to some pretty pricey Chinese restaurants in the valley and wasted money,  Flo's is definitely worth every penny. if you want delicious fine Chinese/Thai cuisine, flo's is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Initially had some trouble getting through to call in an order, but Flo got us taken care of. Awesome experience as usual, food is always fantastic, and customer service exemplary! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This time i ventured off my usual noodle dish and started off with Chinese Lettuce Wraps which were on the HH menu. It was large enough to be an entree. We ordered the Mongolian Beef and Scallops with mushrooms. The only issue I had with those entrees was there was a good amount of green onions and onions in both dishes. There were three types of mushrooms with the Scallops and both dishes had an okay flavor. The server was pleasant and was able to answer all of our  questions. Our water glasses were kept full."}
{"text":"Tried this place instead of our usual Flo's in the Promenade.  Arrived on a Thursday night at 6:30 PM and it was so noisy, I could hear the sounds bouncing off the walls. This venue has a large bar area.  The service was lacking and the food was so-so.  Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Took a while to finally get seated and the waitstaff acted as if it wasn't their job to seat us. When the waitstaff finally paid attention to us, we were seated, but the service was pathetic. The need for drink refills went unnoticed and it took 30 minutes to get the check. After leaving the restaurant, neither of us felt great from the food and decided the leftovers needed to be trashed. I had such high hopes for this restaurant, but I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Had the Malaysian coconut beef & it was amazing. Coconut curry soup was awesome as well as the spicy Kung pao chicken. Tasty meal, great service."}
{"text":"The girl on the phone taking my order was so disorganized I had to repeat my order several times and even explain some of the dishes to her so she knew what I was talking about. I was quoted 30 minutes and ended up waiting about 40 for my food. To top it off, I asked for no bell peppers in my dish because I am allergic, and what do I find in my food? Tons of bell peppers. Thanks. The other food I had was flavorless and disappointing. This location is absolutely terrible. The FLW location is so much better. Update: I found a hair in my food. I couldn't even make up how bad this experience was."}
{"text":"I've been eating Flo's for some time now but this was my first dine in experience. Server was friendly knowledgeable and attentive. Happy hour was a steal, I had a 22oz Tsing Tao for $3. I had the Seafood Sizzling Rice Guo Ba which was delightful. I would recommend doing your research before you go because the layout of the menu is rather sporadic. They have plenty of vegetarian and gluten free options that are clearly marked on the menu. My dish came with huge pieces of shrimp and scallops and I think was fairly priced based on what you get. Atmosphere was pleasant and I believe the owner even stopped by to say hello. Food and service time was great. Only complaints I have are the water could taste less \"tappy\" and the menu could be more organized. 5/5 a great experience every time."}
{"text":"I recently had lunch here with a friend who recommended it. The restaurant is modern, which to some may seem a bit sterile. I thought it was a pleasant atmosphere, very clean, with the tables spaced so that you were not on top of the diners next to you. I chose Teriyaki Chicken, and fortunately inquired whether it included any vegetables. The waiter said it did not, but offered to have fresh steamed vegetables added for a small fee. The waiter was very attentive, constantly refilling our water glasses, etc. Our entrees arrived fairly quickly and were delicious. The added vegetables were prepared perfectly. The portions were generous and I took home half of mine for dinner. I would definitely return to Flo's and would recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Came here twice for Happy Hour where apps and drinks are all 50% off. And you get to sit in the restaurant so that makes it nice when the bar is full or you have more than two people. Potstickers are good-chicken better flavor than the pork. You get 4 chicken ones and 6 pork. The chicken are bigger than the pork so it balances out.  Shrimp skewers are good and good deal.  Shu mai-awful. Mushy. Stay away from these.  Salt and pepper wings-yummy. Good taste. Big and plump.  Spring rolls-not the rice paper wrapped Vietnamese ones. These are fried like lumpia or skinny egg rolls. Better than I thought in that there was lots of meat in the chicken ones.   Chicken skewers (both kinds)-had mixed reviews.  Some people liked them and some did.  Calamari-good amount.  Not the best I've ever had but for the price, pretty good.   I've also had the lunch version of the Dan Dan noodles and they were pretty good.   There's not many good Chinese places in the area so unless you want to drive to Mesa or Tempe, I think this is a good sub."}
{"text":"We had relatives in town over the weekend at a resort down the street from Flo's. First of all, they do not deliver. The night family got in, we got Chinese rather than go out, because they were tired from their road trip. My fiancé had to go pick it up, and since we had no menu, I just ordered typical items over the phone, and was not given the total. Had we seen a menu with prices, no way we would've gone to Flo's. First of all, the prices are outrageous, and do not reflect the quality of the food. Got five dishes and the tab was $85! Where we get Chinese delivery in Phoenix, tab would've been under $50. The pork foo yong was just a big egg patty with bean sprouts, but NO pork, at $12.95, but the gravy was good. The vegetable pad Thai had no flavor and was made with big fat noodles instead of the thin rice noodles we were wanting, and not many vegetables, at $12.??  The most disappointing dish of all was the shrimp fried rice. Not only was it NOT fried and had no flavor, but it was plain dry white rice with peas, egg, a few vegetables, and about 7 tiny shrimp, at $14.95. It was nothing like the moist brown yummy shrimp fried rice I used to get, with lots of shrimp. The veg spring rolls were good, but $6 for two! The Mongolian beef ($15.75) was small, but very good. And The Kung Pow chicken ($13.50) was a nice surprise with red peppers along with the typical green, and extra vegetable - not too many peanuts though. All in all, most of the meal was disappointing, but the biggest shock was the $85 vs. $50 for the same but YUMMY items AND delivery to our door. Will not go there again when staying in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE flo's... but I haven't been there in a few years, and this time it just wasn't as good as I remember it. The beef and broccoli was tasty, I definitely enjoyed that. The crispy noodles had a sauce that was way to salty for my taste. Service was good, it was way too loud and way too dark. I don't mean to sound like and old lady, but it was really dark. i usually like to be able to see what I'm eating... overall its fine but I wouldn't go out of my way to rush back."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST casual Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale! The food is always fresh and the sauces are light and delicious! Great Happy Hour and Saturday lunch specials! If you go for Saturday lunch get there early because people line up for the restaurant to open. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST casual Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale! The food is always fresh and the sauces are light and delicious! Great Happy Hour and Saturday lunch specials! If you go for Saturday lunch get there early because people line up for the restaurant to open. Well worth the wait! Flo even occasionally stops by your table to see how things are going."}
{"text":"I've always liked Flos for their multiple oriental offerings from chinese, Thai and Vietnamese, plus the freshness of the food. Today the food was good but service was really lacking. It took multiple requests just to get water and my food came out after many other tables were served that had come in after me."}
{"text":"I've read about this place a lot and it met the hype.  Food tasted fresh and great quality.  Will be beach definitely."}
{"text":"I can still remember being at ASU more than a decade ago, and laughing late at night every time I saw a commercial for Flo's.  No matter what I was watching, somewhere between midnight and 3:00am it would air at least once.  A cheap, but somehow overly produced ad featuring an asian woman with a heavy accent introducing herself, and explaining why I should eat at her restaurant.  Yes, it's quite immature, but it led to a friend of mine and I becoming obsessed with trying Flo's on general principal.  And when we finally did, we were surprised to become big fans.  All these years later, Flo's is still in the valley, still awesome, and still popular.  (for better or worse, the commercials are gone).  My girlfriend and I ordered takeout, and at 5:45 on a Friday, the place was slammed.  I'm not one to go by the adage that popular means good, but when a lot of valley residents are passing up the chains or a local spot, it's a positive sign.  We had the lettuce cup (think PF Chang's lettuce wraps with a fresher taste), Kung pow chicken (holy crap this was good), beef and snow peas (also awesome).  The meats were all sliced, cooked, and sauced perfectly.  I have nothing bad to say about any of those dishes.  Food is good.  Portions are good.  Prices are good.  The only negative is trying to park.  The strip mall this restaurant has very limited parking.  It can be a battle for a spot during peak lunch and dinner hours.  It's also very loud inside when it's busy, but that seems to be a trend nowadays, so I guess that makes Flo's a trendsetter."}
{"text":"Out favorite Asian restaurant in the west!! Love Flos restaurant! And love Flo!! She is a wonderful owner who is generally there toi greet us every time we frequent her restaurant! You can tell she takes pride in her restaurant and is genuine with her customers.  The hot and sour soup is delicious and the very best I have ever had! It's got loads of shrimp, chicken, mushrooms and tofu in it and the savory flavor is over the top!!  Another favorite is the green curry chicken, house lo mein, moo shu pork, Mongolian beef with broccoli just to name a few of our favorites!! Oh, and did I forget to mention her lettuce wraps!! Yummy! Flos is one of the first places we dine when we are in Scottsdale!!  We were there last night! 6 of us and ate to capacity for under 80.00 plus tip! That was with no alcohol and most of us were hydrating with just bottled water. Buy HAPPY HOUR DAILY with 50% off all drinks and appetizers!! What a great Value!!  The only reason I did not give Flos 5 stars was because of the service. Generally the service really good, although the last few times it took forever to order, then get our food. And the waiter kept forgetting to bring out extra sauces!  Hopefully the next visit i will update to a 5 star! Until next time..... I highly recommend you try this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here together with friends. The place was packed and loud but it was understandable because it was after all, peak hour. The staff were friendly and serve the food as fast as they could. The food though, is nothing authentic. The Tom Yum soup is far from how it should taste though I should give credit for making it \"look\" like one. It's not that bad that you cant eat it, but if you're looking for a real Asian cuisine taste, it's not gonna be from this place."}
{"text":"Stephanie was our waitress and was extremely attentive introduced myself and my business partner to the lunch menu and guided us both to a delicious and customized items for both of our dietary needs and edible desires. I ate the beef/broccoli sweet and spicy with veggies and no rice. The veggies were cooked perfectly, and not over cooked nor undercooked and the meet was tender. Highly recommended for a nice lunch or dinner. Ask for Stephanie and share with her a story from \"Alexa\" to make for good conversation and a laugh."}
{"text":"Stopped here last night for happy hour - most all appetizers and drinks 50% off - what a deal! Then, we got carry out for home.  Food was excellent, fresh, tasty.  If I lived here I'd be a regular!"}
{"text":"I was there for Christmas at 5pm. Jammed packed is an under statement. Apparently partially because very few restaurants are open then.  We ordered soup and after quite a wait I knew the soup would arrive at the same time as the entree and that's exactly what happened. Totally understandable because of how slammed they were.  The Thai Coconut Shrimp soup was awesome. The Yellow Curry Shrimp was good but lacked the level of flavor the soup had. The quantity of the shrimp was quite adequate. The staff was young and wholesome, very nice. Prices are reasonable. I look forward to returning when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Ok...so who goes to happy hour at a Chinese restaurant? This guy does now!!! Wow! Great food...great specials and our server Stephanie was prompt...witty...and provided great service! Will you see me again....uh yes!!!!! Flo's does happy hour right. Only problem....I ordered so many apps I didn't try the entree's! Next time I will pace myself...as if! Lol....a must try!"}
{"text":"This is the newest in the chain of restaurants owned by Flo. This is my preliminary review, as the restaurant has only been open for two days and like all new places it has a few things to work out.  I arrived at 6:30 and was seated immediately. I was offered a libation and ordered a Diet Coke, the only diet drink on the menu. I would have ordered Iced Tea except that the only sweetener available was what many restaurants have removed from their tables in favor of Splenda. Unfortunately, the carbonator on the soft drink line was not working properly and my Diet Coke was mostly syrup and water.  The restaurant was nice looking, but was all hard surfaces making for a somewhat noisy environment. The addition of some soft hangings or some carpet would ameliorate the amount of sound.  First ordered were Spicy Wontons and Chinese Lettuce Cups. The wontons had good texture and I loved the very light wrapper around it. The flavor was very light as was the spice but I would order it again. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the lettuce wraps. My plate contained a half head of lettuce which was not taken apart at all, so my first order of things to do was to tear apart a half head of lettuce. In doing this a number of the leaves broke apart, leaving me with broken leaves to place the contents on and later drip down my hands. The filling did not impress me as it seemed to lack flavor which the accompanying sauces could not make up for.  Next was the Hot and Sour soup. A lovely bowl of properly gelatinous soup swimming with all sorts of goodies including very fresh shrimp. I added some vinegar and chili oil and it tasted just like I remember from China. This soup was dynamite! I'd have loved a bit of Ogo in it but it was a great soup.  Next was Kung Pao Chicken. One of the ingredients in it was zucchini which was a nice surprise since so many places use celery. A second nice surprise happened when I was served both white and brown rice. While white rice is traditional in oriental cookery, the brown rice is a nice addition for those who prefer a healthier option or prefer the nutty taste of it. The chicken was cooked to perfection, but once again the dish seemed to lack in the flavor department. It seemed to be lacking the heat and flavor that should be part of the dish, as well as the peanuts that I could not find.  I was brought Ma Po Tofu to try. It was made with regular peppers, and while the ingredients were all there, none of the heat was. I wish it had been made with real Szechuan peppercorns which would have made it an authentic dish even if it had to cost more.  Last was the Chocolate Wontons. Half wontons cooked till hardened then covered in a dark chocolate sauce plated with a slice of orange and dusted with powdered sugar. I appreciated the interplay of the orange and chocolate, but there was no way to eat it without getting my fingers dipped in chocolate too. Not that that is necessarily bad for a chocolate lover, but getting cleaned up afterward without a wet nap is a problem.  Overall, as a new opening there are a few problems to be ironed out, especially in the flavor area. Most of the food seemed cooked beautifully but lacking all sorts of seasoning. While Flo is noted for healthy variations in her food, she is not known for lack of flavor and I am hoping that this will be worked out by my next visit in a few months. If I had to sum up the food in one word it would be fresh. The food was anything but tired and worn out and the use of nice fresh ingredients was apparent.  The restaurant seemed spotless. The waitstaff was a little confused but that is to be expected in a new opening. The cashier needs to know that sitting on the counter where the register is does not look nice and is unacceptable.  I'm giving 4 stars for quality of ingredients and for service in a new environment. Next time I hope to give 4 stars for flavor as well.   As my readers know, I do not accept free meals, and after paying for my dinner I found that the  charge on my card had been voided and the meal had been comped. In keeping with my precepts, I have donated the cost of the meal to a local charity."}
{"text":"Love Flo's! The food here is awesome, prices are great and people are great too. I was just a little bummed when I came here for lunch on a Saturday at 11:45 am to realize they didn't open until 12 pm! Thought that was a little funky for a place that is known for their awesome lunch specials. Now I know, and will plan more accordingly. No biggie.  The salad they brought out to start was so delicious. In the future I will ask for light dressing because in my opinion I thought there was a little too much on it. But the flavor was definitely there. For my entree, I ordered the Garlic Chicken with brown rice. It came with sauteed veggies as well! So yummy! Craving it as I write this a couple days later. Flo's has become one of my family's top choices due to the fact that they have a lot of vegan options for my brother!   Also have to shout out our waiter. He knew we were pressed for time (the main reason why waiting an extra 15 minutes for them to open was stressin' me out), so he did everything he could to get our food out as fast as possible. I'll be back time and time again! Love it here."}
{"text":"Tried the yellow curry. Very tasty with lots of fresh veggies (green beans, broccoli, carrots, onions). The service was attentive and the lunch portion was just right. The decor is attractive and service was attentive. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"2/28/14  Called out sick from work, and I was craving for egg noodles with either beef, or chicken with ginger, so we ordered the Mongolian Beef (an entree I've already tried before), Thai-style Green Curry chicken (new to me!), and Shrimp with snow peas for Mom for pick-up.  Enjoyed the Mongolian beef (beef with onions, jalapeños, red pepper flakes, and something that looks like sweet potato leaves), but as always, I felt a little let-down when I bite into the pieces and did not find the satisfactory crunch of the caramelization of past Mongolian beef entrees I've had elsewhere.  I was looking forward to the ginger-hot spiciness of the green curry chicken, and while it was slightly underwhelming, which I'm sure is most likely from the fact that I'm suffering from a cold and could not taste all of the flavor notes, I was happy to be able to detect the ginger in the dish.  I loved the long beans in this entree, which also had basil, lemongrass, fresh chilies, shallots, galangal, garlic, and cilantro.  I had a taste of both dishes for lunch, and I would have to say that the beef was more flavorful- saltier, and definitely spicier!  The noodles were angel hair-thin and had not satisfied my dietary lust for stir-fried noodles I fancied while languishing in bed waiting for lunch time to roll around...  I offered to share my dishes with Mom, but she was too busy enjoying her Shrimp and snow peas!  Dinner time came, and I enjoyed the noodles and green curry even more-- it tasted even better, or perhaps I was feeling better from the OTC medication and rest...   Wished this dish contained a LOT of long beans, as I find myself rationing the remaining amount...    Btw, each entree came with a side salad and the signature house dressing."}
{"text":"Take-out sucked violently. Too much vinegar in the hot and sour soup, I felt like an old lady with yeast issues.  But what sucked the most was their new take-out containers; half the size of PF Changs and compartmentalized, like a tv dinner. In one compartment, the rice, entree in the other.  Think about it. What was once a white, four-fold container is now a cheesy two compartment container with half the food.  I'm out."}
{"text":"Takeout takes very long some times. I usually call to order the food so it would be ready for pickup. I went there when they told me it would be ready (about 30min from the call) and I ended up waiting another 30min there.  Awesome $5 lunch special on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"I happend to find this place as I was itching for some sake and left very satisfied.   Grub a dub- I find it sometimes hard to eat asian food , unless sushi or sashimi is involved, because I always feel so full after, but this place is different , slightly smaller portions , with fitting prices. The hot and sour soup intantly became greatness to me.  Service- I guess i went at a weird time as I was the only one in the place , so every thing came out fast and hot.But you can tell the server was about to leave and kept rushing away to do her final things.:(  The Get up- kinda standard look to the place , blacks and red stark asain decor . nothing new or stand out. but not cheesy either.  All in all, ill go again but probably wont suggest it when headed out with friends."}
{"text":"This place always gets rave reviews from my co-workers, so finally we went. Its a nice spot and I am sure there are some meals better than others, but I wasn't blown away as my friends have been describing. It was good, it was standard...nothing our of the ordinary. I don't think I would go back here when I know there is better food elsewhere.   I had the sweet and sour chicken, crab puffs, and pot stickers. The apps were the best part for me, however they were still just your standard apps. Friends had the chicken lo mein and the orange chicken. Both were eh."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. I came with my daughter to enjoy birthday dinner and the farthest we got was being seated by the host and I got to watch the wait staff run around and small talk with customers and run behind the bar and make drinks for about 10 minutes and no one even acknowledged to offer a glass of water."}
{"text":"I love Asian Food.       That being said Fusion places can be very satisfying due to a range of unique choices. But those choices have to be good.      After shopping at Whole Foods we decided to dine here since it appeared to have a good crowd.      The menu has a wide variety of dishes and is very appealing.      We thought of soup and asked a couple next to us what they had and if they liked it. Their reply was that every soup here is great and theirs was the Hot and Sour soup. They were nice enough to lets us try a spoonful after saving their extra. You get a large bowl for a good price.       To be honest it was the best part of our meal along with the sliced BBQ pork. We didn't get any other soup since my friend wanted shrimp.      We started with the Crab Puffs and BBQ Sliced Pork. The puffs were OK though soggy in the center since they weren't fried long enough. The pork was delicious, tender and moist. And was in a nice sauce.      I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo (The worst I've ever had.) Fair taste but no spice with what looked like pre cooked chicken.      My friend had the Spicy Cinnamon Shrimp. A big waste of money. 5 shrimp in a Cinnamon sauce that had very little spice or heat and the 1 I tried, I would swear was cooked with it shell on. Either that or it had the toughest skin under the shell I've ever eaten. They were cooked with peas and came on this big bed of fried wonton strips. It was not worth the money.       If we do return it will be for the soup and to try the Sweet and Sour Chicken which looked good on the table next to us."}
{"text":"Flo's has been our go to place for Chinese, or just a great meal in general, for roughly 10 years. Upscale/trendy scene, great value(especially the daily happy hour), amazing food and service."}
{"text":"Have been told good things about the Scottsdale location. Went in for a late lunch with a friend. Menu selection was awesome and it was during happy hour so it made it even better.  Food was excellent, and the serving sizes were large enough the meal could have been split in two.  The only downside to this visit was the fact they only seemed to have one server on duty. It took her awhile to get our order in and to bring drinks. Could have simply been shift change, not sure."}
{"text":"THREE TIMES IN ONE WEEK! love this place! I went here last weekend after the Open and I went again Fri night because I couldn't get enough... then again yesterday for lunch since a friend had to try it per my raves. I've had a wide variety but here are my faves: Chinese lettuce cups-OMG, Spring rolls(chicken but they do offer a veggie option) these are more like egg rolls but still phenomenal.. and my last fave is the orange chicken. Price is reasonable because you can taste the quality ingredients and get decent service. Lunch portions are cheaper and come with a side salad. Every time I've visited I've gone home with left overs.. even lunch! ..so that says something about their portions(and I'm an eater). They have a decent beer selection and the amount of Sake you get with a bomber is surprisingly a lot.. I think the sale craft holds more ounces than a typical craft. The final item I'll comment is the passion fruit iced tea.. it's REALLY good. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The place was busy on a Friday at noon so we sat outside under a nicely placed umbrella and when the waitress lowered the music the 4 of us enjoyed talking and eating! Shrimp Pad Thai was okay. Would have liked more Pad Thai and not the other half of the plate of brown rice. Others had the beef and snow peas, and others ate the soy and garlic eggplant meal...all with brown rice. Passionfruit ice tea and I liked the green iced tea."}
{"text":"First time at Flo's and was extremely impressed! Not as formal as PF Chang's but the food was just as good if not better.  Service was a little slow, but they were very busy.   Overall a definite plus! We will be back."}
{"text":"We eat quite regularly at Flo's & I know it's Valentine's night, but getting there at 6.55pm & waiting 40 minutes for an appetizer isn't acceptable. So, I stood up & asked for a manager. Tatum came over and I said 6.55 and 40 minutes later no appetizer. What pissed me off the most was not once during the conversation did she apologize, she said, \"were busy\". Then she disappeared never to return to our table. At least apologize. The chicken on the lettuce wraps was burned so that was edible. And when we left the 2 girls up front didn't even say goodbye. Really. I think we'll travel to Jade Palace as they have staff there that are mannerly. C'mon Flo!!!"}
{"text":"Food was not that great, kind of greasy. Container only 3/4 full. Even the soup - I bought the large quart size and received just over half full. Cost was expensive, VERY expensive if you take into consideration none of the containers were full. Egg rolls and spring rolls more dough than filling and extremely greasy."}
{"text":"My brother & I have been coming here for years and Flo's is consistently good.  Whenever I'm in town we'll usually meet for a quick  and reasonably priced lunch at Flo's.    The food is always fresh, tasty and prepared with quality ingredients.  I'm especially fond of their Thai-inspired curry dishes, but I haven't been disappointed by any of their meals. The lunch special comes with a small salad and even though I'm not a big fan of iceberg lettuce, Flo's yummy salad dressing more than makes up for it.   This place is run like a well-oiled machine with prompt, capable and friendly service.  If you're on a time schedule for your lunch break you can depend on Flo's to get you fed with efficiency. All of this and only $8? Oh yeah, that's why Flo's is our go-to lunch break in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Flos is my absolute fav spot for lunch in Scottsdale! You can't beat the prices, the service is fast and the food is always fantastic. They have done an amazing job for so many years. You can't go wrong for lunch!"}
{"text":"I have never had such fresh and great chinese food!  We had take out tonight and it was piping hot and tasty.  The staff is friendly too.  Just wish they delivered..."}
{"text":"Great service.  The waitress and waiters, the whole staff was kind and so helpful.  They paid attention to us despite larger groups nearby ordering drinks.  I Really felt respected here.  The value is great here too, You get a lot of food for what you pay.  so why the 3 stars?  The food sucks.  Sorry, its the same quality and taste as when Safeway makes Chinese food.  Its was very mediocre."}
{"text":"It has been about 6 months since we were at Flo's last. We used to frequent Flo's on a regular basis and it was one of our favorites in town for Chinese food. There lunch prices have gone up to about $9. I understand the need to increase prices, but the half dinner portion that used to be half the price for lunch is now only a few dollars cheaper than dinner and still half the size. You do get a salad with lunch,but it is essentially iceberg lettuce with a little dressing. I would spend the few dollars more for a dinner portion if you like having leftovers. I ordered the Moo goo gai pan as usual. It came out without any chicken. I let our waiter know that there was no chicken and he took the dish away without apology. I waited for about 15 minutes while the rest of my party ate there lunch. Another gentleman brought out a new and improved Moo goo with chicken, but without a word of apology. I then realized that it was almost bone dry and did not have any more than a glisten of sauce. I asked the waiter who delivered my dish for some sauce because the dish didn't seem to have any. He said \"oh , you would like some extra sauce\" and I said no I would just like some sauce on the dish as it appears that it was left off. He returned with a small cup of sauce, again without a word. I felt badly wasting almost the entire cup as I only wanted a couple of spoonfuls not a drowning plate, but did appreciate some sauce finally about 25 minutes after my party received there food. I was incredibly disappointed by the mistakes and service. This used to be a favorite and I hope that they were just having an off day, but we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance and service. Thank you Flo for bringing your great food to the Tempe area! You are the best!"}
{"text":"Have been coming to Flos for years - every time it is absolutely delicious. Really great Chinese food - this place is a must! Get the cream cheese wontons and orange chicken !!"}
{"text":"It can be hard for me to find well cooked tofu so I was so excited to finally find a place for awesome tofu Asian dishes! Really good food, friendly and attentive service and the atmosphere was really cool.   **Update: They recently changed their menu and some of the food items that were favorites are now either gone or not as good. It's a bummer for us."}
{"text":"Flo's is still a go-to family favorite. We prefer this location over the other locations. The salad dressing they use on the house salad is so addictive. Their portions are very large, if ordering something like sweet and sour chicken we use an entree to feed two people. We always order sauce on the side, in case we need to take something home. The kids offerings are hearty portions, I often order them for my adult meal."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in the place. I really liked the katsu chicken. Only bad thing I have to say was that there was obvious food spilled on the ground that no one bothered to clean up."}
{"text":"That's not Chinese Food!  This is so watered down to match the vanilla patrons in Scottsdale.  I find it offensive to be frank."}
{"text":"That's not Chinese!  I eat here once and never again.  Not because the food is bad per se, it simply isn't Chinese food.  Flo has so watered down her menu by cutting the very thing that makes Chinese food Chinese Food, SPICY!    But that's not her fault, its the people in the Scottsdale area who somehow think that's how Chinese food is suppose to be - IT ISN'T!  But how can one argue with Flo's success?  ME!  She sold out to the N.E. crowd who thing an onion is spicy!  If Flo's was Chinese food I'd give her higher rating, the problem is, that's what she markets herself as.   Her husband or ex-husband stuck to his guns and made some excellent Chinese food, but the local palettes couldn't handle real Chinese food and he went under!  How unfortunate that we in Scottsdale have to give into those from the N.E. that have no sense of good food.  Too Bad!"}
{"text":"Food is always great but the service was terrible.!!!  The hostess was very rude and we had to ask 3 people to get a waiter to take our order."}
{"text":"Flos is close to our house, yet we have never tried till now. The staff was young, but I was pleasantly surprised at a couple of \"stand outs\" that really shined.  I am in a wheel chair from a recent motorcycle accident and have found that helpfulness and courtesy comes from how you are raised, not training.  So thankful that a couple of the guys went out of their way to clear a path and hold the door for my wife who was pushing the wheel chair. Very much appreciated.   Now the food.  I had the king pao chicken and my wife had Kung paolini vegetables.  Excellent flavor and presentation.  My wife ordered a side salad for $6 and it was huge. Plenty for both of us.  Dinner came with a large pot of brown rice.  We took the rest home and had for dinner that night.  Great value.  The decor was clean and nicely done.  The only thing I would change is the background music.  It seemed to be a radio station and took away from the ambiance.  Other than that a great experience.  We will come back.  Give them a trt"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I came here as a celebration, got chocolate wantons as a gift. Amazing atmosphere! Beautiful menus and easy  to read. The staff so so friendly! Stephanie was amazing and very personable. We will be here again soon."}
{"text":"3.5  I'd been to their other Scottsdale location, and a friend and I grabbed lunch here yesterday afternoon. It was a little afternoon and it was not packed, but no one was at the host stand so a group of about 6 of us waited for someone to greet and seat us. After 2-3 minutes someone came out and seated us. Our server came by not too long after and took our drink order and came back with the wonton chips and we ordered a side of pork gyozas. The gyozas are super small, but it was enough to split between the two of us with everything else that comes with the lunch specials. I liked the salad that came out, though the dressing was a bit runny.   I decided on the southeast asian peanut chicken with brown rice, which I really liked. The thing of rice they bring out is giant and could easily be split between two. My friend had the katsu chicken and said it was good, though he prefers their teriyaki chicken. We ended with the chocolate wontons which were good, but they sound better than they tasted.  The thing I noticed about this location and the other is that the wait once your done with your meal the wait is painstakingly long. Maybe it's because I'm watching the clock because I have to get back to work, but it took a long time to get out once we were done eating.  Food is good. I'll be back to either location again."}
{"text":"I have been going to Flo's for more than 10 years and have always loved the food and value. The last few visits have been disappointing. Last night we did our traditional New Year's Eve take out and were disappointed again when the sweet and sour sauce for our sweet and sour chicken was missing and the sauce for our dumplings was also missing.  I had checked the order when I picked up but forgot to check for the sauces. Needless to say, dinner was not very good. We have had problems before with take out and at this point, I can't see us doing this again. There is no quality control in Flo's take out and when I spend more than $60 for dinner, I expect to get what I pay for. Flo, if you read this, add a quality control step to your take out process."}
{"text":"FLO... Please open a central Phoenix location!   I have to agree with Gabi.. I love this location.. the service is always good, the food always yummy.. This location is focused on Thai flavors more so then Chinese.   Today I came in for their lunch special.. not bad for $13.00 !   Started with the Pot Stickers... 6 little pan fried dumplings, savory and piping hot! These are one of the best in the valley I think! ($5.00)   For the main entree, I ordered the Lemon Grass chicken ($7.50) which is a smaller portion then dinner, served with rice and a fresh mixed green salad, peanut dressing. This dish is my favorite here... tender chicken slices, teamed with lots of mixed veggies, all kissed with lemon grass infused light brown sauce..YUM! You really can't go wrong here..   From what I understand from the attentive bartender is that Flos offers a happy hour Mon-Friday with half priced drinks and appetizers... and on Saturdays, they offer a $5.00 lunch special! Awesome! Check it out... if you like Thai... you'll love this Flos Location!"}
{"text":"In town for business, came out to eat solo. I adore hot and sour soup, and this is about the best ever! BUT. Tell a solo diner that it is served in family portion!!  Food was SLOW. Does this make the feeling of satiety last longer perhaps?  Kung Pao chicken had decent flavor, but sadly not as spicy or overall as good as PF Chang. Good veggie component, though."}
{"text":"Delicious food. We ordered the shrimp and green beans and it was piping hot and super tasty. Their lunch portion is generous and food is not greasy at all! Service was spotty our waitress pretty much ignored us and looked cranky. I know this is almost expected at Chinese restaurants but why should that be okay? If they were friendlier and service was better I would give them 5 stars"}
{"text":"By far the best Asian cuisine we've had. The food was authentic, our sever knowledgeable and attentive. The restaurant has a great vibe, nice atmosphere. We walked in unaware of it being part of their 3 hour happy hour so that was a nice  little bonus!"}
{"text":"I used to love Flos. Someone should write to them directly about their price increase. So sad. They have good food & reasonable prices. Funny, the food doesn't taste as good as it once did."}
{"text":"Opting out from the noise and hustle of Flo's we called in a take-out order recently.  Arrived for pick-up as instructed in about 35 minutes.    As usual, the place was hopping when I arrived.  Transaction was completed quickly and I was out the door with my order.  All happy - until I got home and realized that my order was incomplete.  Rec'd only the appetizer & rice, but neither of the 2 main dishes I'd ordered.  Now I'm NOT happy.   Called to inform Flo's of the problem, talked to a \"manager\".  She was snippy and basically told me it was my fault for walking out with only 1 bag when they had 2 for the order.  Yes, and how was I supposed to know that??  I requested credit back to my credit card, more discussion, finally she says \"I'm not going to argue with you\" and hung up.  Huh, what has this conversation been then?  Several days later I found my credit card had been credited back.  Hurray, I won't have to dispute the charge with my credit card company.  Flo's - you screwed up and blamed it on me.  Your food isn't that great anyway and your attitude is worse.  Think about adding some customer service to your menu.  In the meantime I'll find another restaurant that actually wants my business."}
{"text":"No wifi?!?!?!? Shame.   25 min wait for takeout or dine in -- at 1:15 on a Sat?! They need more staff.  Food has gone down-hill here.  Very inconsistent.  Used to be a consistent winner but now we've had several mediocre to inedible dishes on multiple visits."}
{"text":"Pretty awful.  We were here years ago and now I remember why we had never returned.   The place was packed so obviously my opinion is in the minority.  The hot and sour soup was OK, but it should be mostly broth, lemongrass and a few items.  It was sloggy, stew-like with an almost mucous like consistency.   The egg rolls left a major oil slick on the table.  The lettuce wraps were just AWFUL.  Instead of finely chopped tasty ingredients this was some flavorless mystery mush.  Just awful.  The beef and chicken dishes were swimming in soy sauce, hence total salt taste.  No taste but salt.  Good thing I do not have high blood pressure.    I am only giving it 2 stars (the food was 1), as the servers were quite nice and helpful.  Wow, the lack of good ethnic places in this valley floors me.  When this can pass for Chinese there is something seriously wrong with the taste in Scottsdale.  I guess if you never ventured from some Midwest suburb (or Mars) then moved here, this kind of flavorless salty greasy food would be on par.  But anyone who has eaten at a big city Chinese place would never return.  (And we won't)."}
{"text":"Recommended, but not a fan. Maybe dining in gives a better \"experience\" but food not worth the trip or price. I appreciate flavorful food and am a huge fan of Asian and Thai cuisine. Very disappointed with burnt pot stickers, over cooked Mongolian beef, nothing special egg fried rice and no flavor chicken low mein. Only good choice was brown rice."}
{"text":"So let's start with the the good stuff.  We went in for lunch on a Tuesday, we got greeted and sat down right away.  We decided what we wanted and ordered.  When the food got there it was pretty good.  I would go back for the food.  Now to what was not good.  Our service was not good. The guy who brought out our food was rather rude.  Our rice order was wrong, it wasn't a huge deal.  We ordered brown rice and got white rice.  I let the waitress know and she asked the guy who brought our food to get the brown rice.  Once again, he was really not friendly.  He gave us the impression he was pissed to have to be helping us at all. Our waitress was ok.  Just ok.  So since this was our first visit I will go back because I liked the food.  If the service isn't better there will not be a third time."}
{"text":"I could take their green curry sauce and eat it with just the brown rice and be a very happy camper. I might even be able to just eat it with a spoon and be perfectly content. Have gotten it twice and can't imagine getting anything else there. I also really enjoy the tea they serve...its green tea with brown rice infused, or something like that. So its a little nutty tasting, and very good! I tried the lemon pepper chicken once and didn't like it; it was very dry. Don't know if there was supposed to be sauce or something, but either way it was very tasteless. The dan dan noodles are good, too."}
{"text":"I could probably eat the green curry chicken every day and not get tired of it. I order the same thing ever time and it never disappoints. I have very nice friends who share their food with me, and can say that the dan dan noodles, tom yum soup, and twice baked pork are also delicious. I wasn't a fan of the lemon pepper chicken because there was no sauce. I also love that they give you hot green tea for free if you ask."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop after golf with a friend who recommended it.  Very nice interior and is a great happy hour spot.  We went at 2pm so no one really there, to be expected at that time.  Selection of Chinese and Thai dishes is excellent.  Unfortunately, there was no descriptions of the items.  I eat out a lot so knew what to expect but it's nice to see what it comes with as one restaurant to another makes the same dish differently.  I had spicy and crispy chicken.  It was a smaller portion but very tasty.  It was not spicy but a side of Siracha fixed that quickly.  I would g"}
{"text":"good satay and nice service...the happy hour rocks....you get all sorts of stuff half off...good stuff too, your bill ends up being so cheap, we always get the shrimp skewers appetizers...next time im going to order 2 of those and have that as my dinner"}
{"text":"Always busy. Expect to wait for a table. The food is very good. We always enjoy the broccoli beef and teriyaki chicken, and the wonton soup is a great choice. Lots of variety on the menu. Staff is good, but always rushed. You can't beat the price for this kind of restaurant. A fave of ours when too busy/lazy to cook."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick late night bite and was so warmly greeted by a tall blonde hostess. She genuinely made us feel welcomed, unlike normal hostesses that just ask \"how many?\" in a dull voice. As soon as we sat down, a server assistant (or a different server) poured us waters. Our server Forest quickly greeted us and made himself readily available for menu questions. Forest was sooo kind, polite and professional. He checked back with us often and was on his game our whole visit. As we were wrapping up, being the last people in the restaurant, a couple walked in 15 minutes before close (so annoying) and Forest didn't show one bit of hesitation or let his demeanor drop. We were so incredibly impressed by the staff and excellent food, as per usual. Thanks Forest and Staff for a great experience! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Was over at Flo's this evening for happy hour/dinner. Being a new arrival to Arizona, Flo's is becoming my neighborhood bar/restaurant! My girlfriend and I arrived and ordered drinks and several appetizers from the menu. One dish was not exactly what we were expecting. Flo came by our table and personally asked what the problem was...she not only fixed the order to something more to our liking, but discounted other items that we had ordered.  Thanks, Flo...we will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious Chinese takeout. The eggplant melted in my mouth and the Thai cucumber salad was so fresh and flavorful. Please open an NELA outpost stat!"}
{"text":"Always great!  I've been coming to Flos since she opened.  The ingredients are fresh and combinations amazing!  Of course I always ordered all the normal items, pot stickers, crab wontons, lettuce wraps but I'm personally obsessed with the king pao chicken!  The fresh jalapeños make it for me!  My kiddos always order the fried rice and orange chicken which never disappoints.  I'd always recommend Flo's"}
{"text":"Flo's is a very good restaurant.  The food is yummy and service was outstanding.  The bus person asked us many times if everything was alright and kept our water glasses full.  I asked for chicken with vegetables (not on the menu) and asked for more veggies and less chicken.  They made my dish perfect with lots of nice tender crisp veggies.  Nice place to catch a game as they have 3 tv screens over the bar.  Much healthier than bar food.  Happy hour lasts until 7:00 every evening with half price drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Went with my wife who told me how great it was when she went with her girlfriends earlier in the week. The place is nice and clean. The waiter was nice but we asked for the appetizers to come first and then our food. Well the appetizers took at least 15 minutes to come and one of them was wrong. Then the main dishes came out like one minute later so no time to enjoy. The waiter apologized and also said sorry about the wrong dish but never took it off the bill. The food was pretty bland which is another reason for 3 stars.  The portions were good sized but a little pricey. The east valley has some really authentic Asian places that I would rather go to"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place for Asian cuisine. My sister recommend Flo's as she raved about it!  I ordered the Cantonese Style Pork and was disappointed as the dish really had no flavor and was bland.  My sister ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce which was amazing!  As for a food rating I would give 3 stars.  As for overall experience and wait staff rating I would give a 2.  The staff was definitely attentive, however, when bringing a stack of 6  dishes to the table for our party to use, instead of using 2 hands which would have been a better choice, the waiter chose to use 1 hand and placed the stack of dishes on the table with his 1 hand wrapped around the plates and his thumb smack in the middle of the top plate.  First off, probably a health violation, not certain, but definitely would think twice about eating there again.  Second you would think someone who was waiting on tables for a living would know better.  The next thing was twice we were brought a dirty dish and utensils that were not entirely clean.   Really wish I had a better experience as I was looking forward to trying a new place."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty tasty lunch specials... pick a meal and get salad, cinnamony won-ton chips and rice for $7 (plus drink and tip).  The veggie stir-fyr is really yummy.  It can get pretty crowded around lunchtime so go early, but the service is fast, so once you are seated you won't need to wait long for your food."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before on several occasions, but its been a while since I dined in at Flos.  I like it here, though its typical chinese food.  Lovely menu, cool decor, service was okay.  I would come here again.  I split a dish with a friend was hanging out with.  Sweet and Sour chicken was good, and my friends lo mein noodles were exceptionally tasty!!!  yummy.  Great place for first dates, places to take parents while they are visiting here, or just a nicer dinner out then the usual. :-)"}
{"text":"I love Asian food so I love this place! They have a big menu to chose from! I have been here 6 times and have gotten different dishes each time and it never disappoints! There has been a few times that I have visited during HH, they really have an awesome HH. Happy hour offers Half off all appetizers,  that are flavorful and just the right amount. I always leave with leftovers. Service is really great too  :)"}
{"text":"I Will always rate flos 5 stars ....we are regulars and love the place,great food and great staff,but what's up with the country music?It is the most non sense thing ever, a restaurant play list should reflect the concept... since when country music fits in with a contemporary Asian restaurant ??? Weird...."}
{"text":"We were recommended to go to this place because it was good we are in the area and we looked at yelp we were close. Would recommend what were the favorite and it was absolutely Wonderful. This past week for sure will be coming back soon. They also said happy hour from 3-7 everyday."}
{"text":"I think this place put MSG on their food. After dining in last Saturday I got severely dehydrated and was experiencing headache and shortness of breath."}
{"text":"Flo's is tired.  The same restaurant that was jammed with diners nightly five years or so ago is now only fairly busy.  The food is almost the same as it was then, but the world has changed, and diners now expect more innovative and tasty fare.  This is not to say that Flo's is bad, and judged against the universe of Chinese neighborhood restaurants, it probably would rate four stars, but I can't bring myself to judge Flo's that way - to me it aspires to be a top-of-the-line eatery and it just isn't.    Both the dishes we ordered were fine - pepper shrimp and sweet and sour chicken - but not great.  The portions were more than adequate and the ingredients were better than average (larger shrimp, good white meat chicken).  But the flavors were yesterday, the service was maybe a bit too casual, and the restaurant was far too loud, especially when the bar was full of people.  I enjoyed my meal, but only a little more than Panda Express.  Not good enough for that fourth star.  Flo's: down an energy drink and get some new life, or perhaps it's just time to retire."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. I'm a fan of spicy and they are capable of making the food spicy and flavorful. The thai soup is amazing, the salads are great too. It can be a little pricey for some people but it is very worth it. Beautiful restaurant, beautiful food, great staff. I used to go to the Tempe one and now I moved and there's a flos close by and I couldn't be happier about that!"}
{"text":"Flo's is a really authentic chinese resturant, they do have other cuisines such as vietnamese and thai, but stick to the Hong Kong Chinese Food.  I have not had anything I did not like here, as a chinese food veteran I am happy to have found this place! I constantly miss the LA 626 chinese food, the struggle is real.. trust me. Their prices for lunch are decent, my coworker and I tend to lean toward coming here every time we can't decide where to go.    What to eat:  Beef basil fried rice  Hainan Chicken, extra ginger sauce please!  Fried seafood noodle  Egg Foo Young (cooked soft)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour with half price drinks. Interesting and unique drink menu. Awesome Bloody Mary. Nice little wonton chips for free at the bar. Salt and pepper chicken wings take a little while but are worth the wait. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other Flo's restaurants in Scottsdale and I have always had a great dining experience so I was happy to discover a Flo's on the south side of town. Since it was part of the other restaurants, I expected the same level of quality service and food at this location but was really surprised.  Oh gosh, the experience was way off...  REVIEW OF SERVICE:  The waiter must have been new because his explanation of some of the dishes wasn't really helpful.  Additionally, we were in mid-bite when he came over, said it looked like we were wrapping up, and asked if we wanted the check. what.the.fuck. The restaurant was only 15% full, you need to make room for imaginary customers?  Also, usually at Flo's the salad comes out really quick but for some reason today, the salad took quite a while and it was thrown onto the plate so half-assed, it was spilling onto the table when they served it.   Also when the food was delivered, the waitress practically whispered the name of the dish while trying to move it to the table. We had to ask her what dish it was so we could direct her on where to put it.   The restaurant had a lot of employees but the quality of the service was just lacking. Sad really because I brought two friends who hadn't ever been to a Flo's and I'm not sure if they'll try any of the other locations after having such a bad experience.   REVIEW OF THE FOOD:   The pot stickers were steamed and fried like they were supposed to be but they were pretty doughy and the sauce they gave us was really shallow so we had to move the dumpling around in the sauce dish to get some flavor on the dumpling...  Imagine trying to take a bath in 4 inches of water in your tub-  yeah, it was like that.   The eggplant dish was poorly cooked.  One bite into the eggplant and the whole veggie would explode with water. The water completely diluted the flavor which made it feel like we were eating a sponge.  The curry chicken was decent but didn't have much sauce which is funny because to cook that dish, one would need quite a bit of sauce because the chicken, green beans and basil leaves were all evenly coated with sauce but the presentation of it was like a semi-dry curry dish.  Hardly any sauce at all.  SUMMARY:  I can't come back to this location. The other locations are great but this one just seemed like a waste of money."}
{"text":"Good food and excellent service.  If you order the hot and sour soup there is enough and more to share with 4 people."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. 40 minute wait though.  Since it's only been open a short time hopefully the fad will fade away and have more reasonable wait times,  We ordered the spicy and crisp chicken.  Could certainly have been more spicy but it was tasty.  Prices are on the high end for Asian food."}
{"text":"Great Asian place, eclectic menu of Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai and Japanese. Fair pricing. Excellent service. Love the beef and onion dish.  Could be the best Asian place in town IMHO for the overall package.."}
{"text":"Sept 2017 edited to add - Unfortunately Flo's menu has had a drastic change. They removed a lot of the options. I was so disappointed to see that the Singapore chicken satay is no longer available. Not sure we'll be back due to the menu change. It's basically Pei Wei now.   Oh wow!  I hope that tonight wasn't a fluke because our first dinner at Flo's was fantastic!  Be sure you take advantage of the happy hour specials, half off appetizers!  We thought about making our entire meal out of appetizers but decided to get one entree as well.   We ordered Chinese lettuce cups, Singapore chicken satay, shu Mai dumplings and black pepper chicken. Everything was delicious!  The portion sizes were generous. My favorites were the Singapore chicken satay and the lettuce cups.  The ingredients were really fresh, the veggies crisp and beautiful...... Couldn't have asked for a better meal.   Lately we've noticed that a lot of the Asian places we have been eating at have overly salty and sometimes goopy sauces. We were so happy to find a place that reminded us that Asian food shouldn't be so salty and sauce heavy. What a nice change!    We definitely could have ordered a couple more appetizers and not ordered the main entree. We will probably go that route next time if we are there for happy hour. I will also order one of the huge bowls of soup that I immediately regretted not ordering when I saw it brought out to a nearby table.  Service was great, restaurant clean and nice environment. We will definitely be going back sooner rather than later. This place is awesome. I might have to go back for the soup this week!"}
{"text":"Will never go back. Food was not very good. They didn't get my order correct either. The shrimp wontons were so bad they were just thrown away. The beef.. Greasy and tasted disgusting. Gave it a two star cuz I had the tai seafood soup .. Was great .. But mostly broth. We will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Not terrible, but many other better choices in the Valley for American Chinese food.  The soups did not have enough substance (i.e., mostly broth) and three of our four mains tasted the same.  The only standout was the twice cooked pork, which I asked to be extra spicy (and it was)."}
{"text":"Where is the 10 star button.?  I love this ace,  great service,  clean and the food will blow your mind. It's a must visit. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I have been told by many that Flo's is the PLACE to go for GREAT Chinese food...  Unless we went to the wrong Flo's, this place was not impressive at all.  After waiting ten minutes before a food server actually acknowledged us, we were almost ready to get up and leave. It was a young gal who had no clue about anything on the menu...was this the food server or a random customer wandering the restaurant, I wonder?   The soup was good, but not memorable enough for me to come back for more...  The portions? Um, what portions? They were so small...did we order from the kid's menu by mistake? Geez!  Small portions, poor service, ok food...we definitely WON'T be back!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! Half off drinks and almost all appetizers. Our waiter was attentive and even Flo came by to see how we were doing. The atmosphere was great- not super quiet but not very loud either, it definitely had a good happy hour vibe. The food came out relatively fast, except the wings which take about 20mins so order those first. We tried about half of the appetizers on the menu. The crispy springs rolls were great, not too oily and still hot and crisp when we got them. The lettuce cups are a good summer snack, since the lettuce is cool but you still get the warm and fullness from the filling. The chocolate wontons were amazing, just a light dessert to finish of a great meal. Got the Mandarin Orange cocktail which was really good too, I like the sugar rim which contrasted well with the slight tartness of the drink. Definitely going to come back and try some more of the menu as well as the happy hour."}
{"text":"Tried there shrimp kabobs with peanut sauce and was pleasantly surprised, they are juicy and tasty critters!!! The Chicken pot-stickers are homemade and are the bomb with the zesty dipping sauce!!!! Flo you rock the House !!!"}
{"text":"Love this food, staff, and location!  Jeni always greets me with a beautiful smile and gives excellent service for all my to-go orders!  My favorite dish is the Kung Pao Shrimp but everything I've ordered is really good!"}
{"text":"Not feeling Flo's at all, the staff was nice but the place is way too loud and the food isn't as good as the lunch time prices."}
{"text":"The lunch and dinner menu here is fabulous. The food is always so good and fresh! Service is professional and attentive. Been here several times and have always left feeling full and satisfied. I always enjoy the Katsu Chicken on the dinner menu. The only downside in my opinion is the dining area is a bit loud. It can be hard to have a conversation. If you sit at the bar it's nicer and easier to converse."}
{"text":"After going to Flo's loyally for so long they go and change the prices on their happy hour menu. The main reason for going to this spot was the great deals during Happy hour. Our bill doubled for the exact order and the staff didn't seem to care. I showed my bill for the exact same order a few weeks earlier and the amount was $2 shy of being doubled. On to better places now."}
{"text":"Well lets see. I live in the far SW valley and Flo's Asian Kitchen is in the far NE valley. Everytime we go it cost us at least an extra $40 just in gas to get here, however it is well worth it. Been here at least 4 times, the last time we were in, they did not have the wonderful spring rolls. I hope its just a seasonal thing. The lettuce wraps are the best in the valley. I have tried a few other Flo's restaurant, and this one is the best. Very un-Scottsdale atmosphere. Big open room. Tables are some what close to each other, however the few times we have been there it has never been packed. They have the menu layed out by region. Very easy to understand. Their beer/wine list is limited,but what they do have is pretty good. Last time we were in they were featuring Mondavi."}
{"text":"Great place but an even better happy hour! We love it here all there apps are 5% off and you can get amazing food for super cheap! Worth the money"}
{"text":"Thai soup was good (although the chicken was weird and the shrimp looked a little funny).  Dan Dan noodles and mu shu chicken were just OK.  Usually Flo's is better."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars and that's a stretch.   I have heard nothing but raving reviews about this place. The food was good, but nothing to write home about.   The problem here was the service. Our server took forever to do anything for us. We were finished eating for at least 20 minutes before he offered to bring out check and 10 minutes to even get the check after he offered.   Service is a big part of dining. Food was good, but would not come back here simply for the bad service."}
{"text":"We stop at Flo's about every other week and have never been disappointed. Service is always prompt especially when we have Pablo as our server. The happy hour specials are a real bargain and there is a wide variety of appetizers to chose from.  I am amazed to see some negative reviews here as our experience at Flo's has always been great."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple occasions and the service has been great. Our waiter was friendly. We were offered water which was nice.   The food is good and flavorful. The skewers are my favorite along with the lettuce wraps. If you are looking for something that is tasty and easy Flo's is the way to go."}
{"text":"This place used to be a nice option....now, not so much. It's kinda turned into a mix of geriatric retirees and man-bun sporting pretentious hipsters serving bland, overpriced quasi-Chinese. Whoever the bald guy is....maybe a manager or shift supervisor....whatever, has been unnecessarily rude to my girlfriend and myself on several occasions, even though we are polite and always tip well. The taste of the food seems to be in constant decline and they are starting to take their clientele for granted. People of Flo's please \"get over yourselves,\" because we already have and will not be returning nor recommending."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian restaurants in Tempe!! Food is tasty, menu is limited for Veggies but who cares when you are pure Non-Vegitarian :P Loved the ambience and service was really good. Sure will come back and suggest my friends :)"}
{"text":"ALWAYS enjoy this place even before it moved but... the noise is unbearable sometimes. can't even carry on a close conversation and it's definately NOT an intimate setting but.. the hot and sour soup... GREAT and the food has always been terrific. Pretty fast service and the prices pretty fair. Again, I'd give it 43 stars except for the noise. Better than their other locations too."}
{"text":"Too much inconsistency, standards have fallen hard and be very careful if you have a seafood allergy don't assume because you asked them to exclude the shrimp they do or or check it before leaving the kitchen.  Used to be regulars here for years, but we have literally given up on this branch and happily use their Thompson Peak / Frank Floyd Wright one which Flo herself runs really well.    This location at The Promenade sometimes gets it right and the next time messes the same dish up.  For example their base chicken soup / sizzling rice soup or won ton soup may or may not have any seasoning in it and who ever oversee s the kitchen obviously didn't bother tasting it to find out.  This has happen need at least 6 times to us.    Instead of using standard recipes and testing the finished product the same dish can taste totally different on the next visit, and that includes the consistency of the sauce which goes from watery with color to thick and able to coat as it should.  The ironic thing is the Thompson Peak one serves it the same way each time, surely the same owner (Flo) should be ensuring there are recipe cards for each dish and that someone is responsible for testing and tasting what they make.  What bothers me is having sent a dish back asking for some sauce to be provided instead of just using it to coat the food (I have eaten it there literally hundreds of times) I was told ''the expediter says that is how that dish is served' and he sent the dish back to me unchanged!  Interesting that the other restaurant serves it with plenty of sauce every time.    Do yourself a favor, drive the extra 3 miles to the other one and enjoy....."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to restaurants.  Their food is tasty, consistent and good value.  They make the best chicken wings we've ever had, plump, juicy and coated lightly in something that makes them extra tasty, they the. Add some salt (not too much despite the salt and pepper name) and some green onions, bell peppers and not too much chilies which don't blow your mouth away.  They can take 10 mins from ordering, but trust me, they are well worth the wait. We usually also order the spring rolls (2 to a portion) and if we are having only apps for our meal, we will order their potstickers too along side their sizzling rice soup which is also great.  I mentioned the apps because up to 7 pm from I think 5 pm they serve most of the apps are half price for their happy hour, which is great value and they will serve that at the table, not just the bar.  They do something I really appreciate, if you like a dish but would prefer it with chicken instead of shrimp, or with their wonderfully, how do they do it, tender beef pieces.  I also like that they assured me that they don't use MSG in their food (unfortunately I am really allergic), so it takes the stress of of having to study the extensive menu carefully.  If you do get to the entrees, we typically go for the chicken chow fun (wide noodles), honey beef, spicy beef and onions, Thai green curry, cashew chicken, Thai basil chicken and the lemon chicken.  However none of the dishes we've had have disappointed.  Enjoy......"}
{"text":"While having a few valley locations, I have to admit that I always feel like this place is local eatery. I'm not a big fan of the chain places however this location has made the list of \"family go to spots\" as they have something that accommodates our family's wide variety of taste.  Flo's sits near the intersection of Rural & Baseline. Lot's of options in the area so it's busy with wandering drivers. We did a pickup previously during the eventing and parking was challenging, but realized they didn't have a designated Takeout Parks up front.   Comfortable atmosphere with a full bar along with multiple televisions just in case you want to check out a game. We ordered the seafood noodle soup, several potstickers which by the way I enjoy the fact that they make chicken potstickers and not just pork.  We also picked up some orange chicken and peking duck and quite a few cocktails to help with the edge of the holidays.  It wasn't a pack night but it was great to have our server and staff very attentive throughout the course of our meal.  All of the food was solidly good and honestly came out tasting as  expected."}
{"text":"Easily the worst service I've had. First and last time here. Bowls and spoons have food all over them as well. Server forgot to put our order in, food runner ran chips out and spilled them all over the table without saying a word about it or trying to clean it.  Update- Went there for lunch yesterday. Everything was clean, service was good and the food runner didn't spill chips all over. The cleanliness of the restaurant was great."}
{"text":"Been eating here since they've opened. Best hot & sour soup in town.IMO."}
{"text":"Love Flo's! This is a great casual restaurant. It's Asian Fusion - my favs been the appetizers, curry dishes and the pad Thai. They also have a ridiculous happy hour. Half off of all appetizers (except edamame) and half off anything from the bar.   My husband and I just went and we had 2 cocktails (a-flo-ha) and 2 beers, with 4 appetizers: wings (which were really good, crispy and not greasy), lettuce wraps (fresh crunchy lettuce), edamame and spring rolls. All of it was half off on happy hour and cost is only $29! Definitely our new happy hour spot!"}
{"text":"I was so excited that there is a Flo's in Tempe!  The selection, service, and food are amazing.  I try and go once a week to get dinner or lunch.  This is the best Chinese I've had in the area.  My favorites were Garlic Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Mongolian Beef.  I just wish you could order a cup of soup with dinner, but they are generous with portion sizes and offering to bring more rice free of charge.  On Friday and Saturday nights, I would recommend getting there either before 5:30, or after 8:00 if possible, it gets busy and wait times can be long."}
{"text":"I love this place. I dream about their beef. I have no idea what they do to their beef, but it is so soft and tender... Try their beef fried rice, beef egg fu yung, and beef moo shu! In non-beef related items, there is a great Katsu Chicken Salad. And speaking of salads, order a salad (or if you go at lunch, a side salad will come with your meal)!  Their salad dressing is so good you will want to drink it like a soda.  Me:  Can I have a refill? Server:  \"Ma'am, there are no free refills on dressing... Dressing is not a beverage...\" Me: \"num num num...yes it is....\"  One thing I have had there that I don't like too much is the Pad Thai.  I think there's too much fusion going on in that dish and it has lost the authentic taste that I expect from it.  Other than that I really love this place!"}
{"text":"Not the most memorable experience. Service was not good at all and I noticed the female waitresses were mostly in tank tops. Not an issue at Hooters or Tilted Kilt, but not something we enjoyed in this place.  Our waitress was fairly absent, and when the bus staff refilled our water it felt as though we were scum of the earth for making them refill the glass.  Food was OK. Our appetizers were awful, the pork buns were extremely dry on the inside and my wife thought the crab puffs were salty.  The entrees, however made up for it. I got the Yu Xiang stir fry and it was quite delicious, and my wife's sweet and sour chicken was also good.  The prices were manageable, but some of the appetizers seemed expensive for the size.  All in all, not the best experience. We will probably try again, but we couldn't help but feel we would have been way better off just going up to PF Changs."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 14 on a busy Friday night and our table was available when we arrived a few minutes early. Wonderful menu selection. The salt and pepper chicken wings may be the best fried chicken I've ever had. If I have the opportunity to come back, I may order it as my entree. Very, very good. Everyone in our party was happy with his or her entree choice. The only suggestion I have for improvement is service. It was a bit slow, but I realize a party of 14 is  never an easy assignment. I hear happy hour at Flo's is unbelievable. And if I could get those wings half price, I would eat dinner early every night when I'm visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour! Prices can't be beat.   The food is so fresh, hot and tasty! Service was timely and friendly. Asian Fusion isn't typically my go-to, but there are so many options we'll be back more frequently than I'd expect."}
{"text":"I'm downgrading my previous review (5 years ago) from 5 stars to 2 stars for 2 reasons:  1) They've discontinued their special Saturday lunchtime pricing as yesterday we were charged full menu price for a takeout order.  2) They got my order wrong Saturday and apparently it's not a high priority to respond.  I ordered the Indian Vindaloo Chicken (what I always order) and they gave me a spicy chicken dish with broccoli and carrots instead.  It was a takeout order that my wife picked up.  Not worth trying to return it to the restaurant, but trying to contact them turned out to be fruitless.  I likely won't return as a customer."}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant.  The food is very good and a good value.  The service is always excellent.   My wife and I eat here regularly, but prefer their restaurant at Scottsdale Road and FLW."}
{"text":"Flo's is our favorites. Great service....great management The management at Flo's Scottsdale Promenade is outstanding. The restaurant is always very clean, as are the restrooms. The staff do not let dirty plates accumulate  on the table. The water glasses are constantly being topped off, and they gladly bring lemon slices. We discovered Flo's about a year ago, and are \"regulars\" now. (We are Arizona residents, and never head north to escape the heat like so many do) We love it here, and Flo's is a real \"find\". One of our favorite dishes is Pho, either chicken or beef. The very best Pho we have ever had, bar none! The Egg Foo Young is awesome, as is the Salmon and Broccoli. They even will prepare your dish in Sesame oil if requested. Try Flo's, ask for Ryan or Donney. Great service!"}
{"text":"I always start off with the words \"Yelp brought me here\" followed by what I've read and I always find I get great service and in this case the server added a complimentary desert. Either way this place has awesome food, a full bar and a very friendly staff. Oh and get this... They have HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY between 3-7 yes you heard it here first including weekends which would make it \"Happier Hour\". I had a local IPA from the good people at San Tan brewery in chandler called the Hop Scotch IPA and I always order the pad Thai dish when trying a new place and it did not disappoint. If you're in the area stop in trust me!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this is one of the best Asian restaurants in the entire valley. Amazing service, quality, and portions at a very reasonable price. I have heard their happy hour is unbeatable too. I just moved to the hood and plan to make Flo's a regular stop. I also heard the owner is PF Chang's (Paul Flemming's) ex???"}
{"text":"This place turned to crap.  I remember when it first opened I loved this place.  I thought it was the best Chinese Food in town.  Flo took so much pride into her recipes.  I am not sure what went wrong.  I can't speak for all the servers there, but ours was terrible.  No personality just a freaking robot.  She came up to the table to greet us by saying \"Are you ready to order\"  How about some drinks lady?  I can get by with horrible service if the food is good, but the food was lousy.  We ordered chicken lettuce cups, 2 different types of soup and 2 entrees.  They tried to bring the soup out first but I asked them if we could get our app first.  The chicken that came with the lettuce cups was just the fatty pieces of the chicken they don't used with the entree, but all minced up.  The texture was gross and the flavor was bland.  The soups were the only reason this review got 2 stars.  Pretty good.  Wife had wonton soup and I had seafood shelfish soup.    The entrees sucked.  We shared Crispy Spicy Chicken which was more like Soggy Salty Chicken and the Orange Beef which was decent but soggy which made it not as good.  The server never came by again therefore I went the whole meal without anything to drink.  For sure we will not be coming back anytime soon.  I am not sure why this place stays busy, it's not worth my time.  If I wasn't so hungry, I would have returned the entrees and app."}
{"text":"i hate to do drop this down to 1 star, but i just have to. I took my parents and grandparents here for a special dinner, and everyone loved the food... until we saw a roach climbing the wall behind us while waiting for our bill. It completely overshadowed what would have been a great evening. We ended up waiting for our bill at the front of the restaurant, and i discreetly let the server know what the issue was was. They were super apologetic, but that only goes so far. Honestly, I won't be back. Luckily, there's another location near by that i've also been to that has just as good food. (note: menu's are not the same between locations. Which i find odd, but interesting.)"}
{"text":"my go to Chinese food place!!! so fresh and good prices too! the staff are always friendly and professional! in my opinion its the best chinese food in tempe!!"}
{"text":"I visit Flo's about 50 times a year with friends for the past several years.  Never ever has there been anything wrong with any of our dishes.  All super great and super fresh and tasty. Excellent happy hour and specials.  Great service and always 5 star.  I take my out of towners to Flo's and they rave about it and can't wait to come back.  Boy anybody that rates this place below a 5 Star is all wet in our dry state.  Thank you, Flo's!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at the one in NoSco before having gluten issues. And having seen on the menu several gluten free items, was happy to give the Tempe location a try on a recent visit. I ordered the Lemon Chicken entree. I had water to drink as they didn't serve alcohol and I am not a huge tea or soda drinker. My friend got the wonton appetizers, he enjoyed them. I refrained (the gluten thing). The chicken dish was good but a bit bland, so I asked the server if they had gluten free soy sauce. He went in back and came back several minutes later with some soy sauce in a regular soy sauce container, and said \"oh I just put it in a regular container because we don't have any GF containers\". My instinct told me not to try it but my tastebuds won out. Within an hour, I was regretting my decision. I was bloated and all the rest of the fun stuff that comes with being \"glutened.\" The next day I contacted the restaurant to give the manager on duty the scoop because I felt that he could use the opportunity to better educate the staff on food restrictions that people face. If a restaurant goes out of their way to state on their menu that certain dishes are gluten free, they need to take that seriously - because people with dietary restrictions have no choice but to take it seriously. Being glutened is no fun. It very well may have been a simple honest mistake or miscommunication between staff so I won't hold it against them. Anyway, I declined the manager's [Devon] very kind offer for a free meal upon a return because that was not the point of my call. Devon took my critique in stride, was very professional and stated he would definitely talk to the staff. I will definitely give them a second chance since the Manager was so understanding."}
{"text":"FLO'S IS THE S#*%!  I've only been here twice coming from Omaha, NE visiting family, but it's been amazing both times. Highly recommend happy hour 1/2 price drinks and App's 3-7 - the lettuce cups and salt and pepper (vegetable pepper) wings are amazing. Stephanie has been amazing both times!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and I go every once in a while when I am in Scottsdale and wanting Thai food. I liked the chicken pad Thai quite a bit."}
{"text":"I am sorry folks don't enjoy Flo's as much as I do.  I have been a regular patron for years.  Happy hour is absolutely the best deal in town, with half off all drinks and apps in both bar and restaurant, 7 days a week from 4 to 7 pm.  Meals are creative preparations of traditional Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean and Szechuan dishes.  The lunch special for $6 on Saturdays including salad is a steal!  Red curry is non traditional in a thick sauce,  not a bowl of coconut milk. Hot and sour soup is best requested with pork instead of menu method chicken, for richer flavor.  Get the spicy Lao style lettuce cups with lemongrass and fish sauce, you will eat some jalapenos and not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Wasn't many patrons there. Service was attentive. Food came out fairly quick. I enjoyed the lunch specials and discount pricing. Food quality and taste was decent. I would say above average. Good experience overall"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this restaurant at all. Their menu is small, their iced tea was disgusting, and their chicken fried rice was horribly bland. I didn't even order anything because nothing appealed to me on their menu. My husband did enjoy his meal, chicken lo mein, I think it was, so that's why I didn't give it only 1 star. For the amount we paid, we could've gone to a hole in the wall take out Chinese place and gotten 3 times the amount of food with a lot more flavor, and a lot more of a selection. The atmosphere is very nice."}
{"text":"The greatest unknown place in Tempe. Amazing happy hour specials - which helped contribute to me becoming a regular here. They have tasty takes on Chinese cuisine and the ambience inside or outside feels right. If I had a magic wand, I'd probably spice up the servers to be a little more proactive and perhaps even transition into a sophisticated lounge atmosphere for evenings."}
{"text":"I went here for the third time the other night and am finally getting around to reviewing it since it has been a while since I last went. (Flo's was the head to destination for food after landing at Sky Harbor when visiting my boyfriend before moving here back in August.)  My experience with the menu is not that adventurous I will admit. I've stuck with some staples and they have been consistent over the times I've visited. Dinner usually starts with the Garden Green Salad which is fresh tasting with a nice dressing. The menu states a miso dressing but I taste some peanut sauce in it? Regardless... GOOD. I vow to try and replicate it someday. Next staple? The Vietnamese Spring Rolls. Chicken and potato? I know... but they're delicious and one order is never enough it seems. This last time we tried the potstickers. Decent... not the best I've had. They are a little on the chewy side and not quite as crispy as I tend to like them. The flavor lacked a bit too. Dinner consists of the Peanut Chicken which isn't exactly as spicy as I would like it but still pretty good.  I wouldn't say Flo's is the best I've ever had but it's NOT bad in my book. The modern and clean decor makes the atmosphere a nice alternative to little Asian dives I've been to in the past. Service has always been good in my experience."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch one day when we had an appointment in the neighborhood. We hadn't been to a Flo's for quite some time. Unfortunately, we were a bit pressed for time, but we were able to mostly walk in and be seated -- that was a plus.   The decor in the main area is nothing special. To me, it feels like an old diner. I think the bar area has a little more modern feel.  We were given water quickly and someone arrived to take our order shortly thereafter.   The lunch menus don't have descriptions next to the dishes, so if you don't know whether a dish comes with veggies, or what a certain sauce is, you have to ask. I don't know if the dinner menu is the same, but, as someone who likes to read menus, that is a little odd to me. I decided on the spicy cinnamon shrimp, which I had to order because it sounded interesting (even if the only thing I knew about it were those three words). I didn't find it particularly \"spicy,\" but the cinnamon sauce was nice and the shrimp were cooked well -- battered and fried in this case. The portion size was about right: I ate most of it and didn't feel stuffed when leaving the place.   Overall, the service and food were good and the waiter even got us our check quickly when we asked because we were running short on time."}
{"text":"Have heard about this place for years and finally went.  Made reservations, but still had to wait 30 minutes, but they did extend Happy Hour prices for us since we had to wait.  Food was good, service very friendly, but it was very noisy.  Once Happy Hour ended at 7pm, it quieted down.  They appear to be extremely busy during the happy hour.  Will definitely go again, but may just get take out."}
{"text":"We stopped in to Flo's weekly for many years...specifically for the Happy Hour Menu at the bar. The food selection was ALWAYS great, prices were great, and the girl working at the bar was fast/efficient/intelligent. OMG, were we in for a surprise after not being into Flo's for the past few months while we were out of state! The Happy Hour food menu has been reduced to only a few mediocre selections, with all the great selections NO LONGER AVAILABLE ie: Calamari. The Pot Stickers which are down to ONE selection now...are the same price as always, just HALF THE PORTION!!! The other \"regulars\" at the bar were also voicing their disapproval of the \"downsizing\" of selection and quantity as well. The poor bartender/server was most apologetic for the changes and shortcomings. These changes are not confined to the bar menu...they are specific to the regular menu as well. Lo and behold...the back story is that Flo's is in big financial trouble ie: August 2017, filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.  We will not even consider returning to this little restaurant...There are too many other wonderful Asian Fusion/Thai restaurants that are financially stable and serve AWESOME food!"}
{"text":"Customer service is subpar to the quality of the food here . I've ordered the lettuce wraps twice  for take out and twice they've forgotten my lettuce. If the food wasn't so good I wouldn't be so concerned but its delicious . After calling the manager about the second forgotten lettuce incident I then got a personal phone call from Flo . She was extremely personable and understanding and helped me out a lot . It really shows how much you care about your customers."}
{"text":"I've dined at Flo's many times and pick up food to bring home often.  Everything is spot-on delicious. Pictured here are the Crab Puffs which have just the right balance of cream cheese & crab filling to crispy crunch. Also pictured, is the Cashew Chicken which has vibrant al dente veggies, tender, large chicken slices, and fresh cashews.  One of my favorite dishes is the Broccoli Beef.  The Fried Rice is wonderful with tender and fresh meat, peas and carrots. All of their food is fine restaurant-quality, never that of \"take out Chinese.\"  Dining in has always been pleasant, even when they are packed. The decor is modern chic, and the lighting is subdued for a relaxing dinner experience. The service is outstanding. The attractive and efficient wait staff refill beverages before they are empty, serve the delicious egg drop soup into your bowl, and are pros at their job.   They, and even the manager, are very attentive and gracious, checking to make sure that you are happy with everything."}
{"text":"I'm giving this five fat stars because I'd get fat if I still lived in Arizona and was subjected to the close proximity of this restaurant to my apartment.  And job.    I can't remember other things on the menu, other than the Pad Thai.  I'm not sure if Pad Thai is Thai (makes sense that it would be), but I see it at non-fusion Chinese restaurants, often.  Anyway, I don't care about authenticity when something is this spectacularly good.  I am very afraid of flying.  I had to fly back and forth from Phoenix to Burbank (Los Angeles area) once per month for work.  I needed comfort when I stepped off the plane, regardless of if it had only been a one hour and five minute flight.  I'd make a beeline here after getting back to Arizona.  Yummy Pad Thai.  I miss you so much.  You were my friend and comfort against the horrors and fears of the scorpion enemies.    Wide, flat (but short) noodles.. slightly curled..  chicken, egg, sprouts, and other good-tasting things.    I would usually get my order to-go, but the seating area seems cool, too.  Service was also great..  to-go order always ready to go..  price was right.  You know that feeling you get in the deepest parts of your gums and jaw..  that tingling thing that begins the process of salivation?  It's happening now.  They're heeeeeere!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Are used to come here a lot seven or eight years ago and loved it back then."}
{"text":"Waitress wrote down wrong order. And was very rude when we asked for the correct item."}
{"text":"Once again we are at our favorite restaurant. Flo's at the Scottsdale Promonade. The crowd is large and everyone has a smile! Delicious choice of entrees for every taste! Today we are having Flo's Famous Pho with fresh chicken breast, and Teriyaki chicken. A nice salad comes with lunch too!! Jeannie is the manager, and everyone does a great job!! Mike and Jan Phoenix"}
{"text":"We came here to try the half priced appetizers. The items seated were very good and the portions very adequate. We most likely will return for the full dinner selections. Service was excellent and features t very clean."}
{"text":"First off I'm a well Hung Chinese chef   Meh..  Are used to go to the original location in north Scottsdale about a decade ago and it was fantastic.  We tried a few different items here and they were all very bland and I can honestly say you're much better off just going to panda express. It is literally about that quality. Perhaps a bit lower now.  We ordered for items and two of them had to be sent back. The two we kept were average at best.  Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"My first time to Flo's, I needed take out, I craved curry, but saw the Asian Peanut Chicken on the menu and knew I had to have it.  I called in,  first thing,  the guy taking my order didn't rush me.   Second,  their chicken isn't breaded,  yeah!  Third, I wanted extra veggies and he was kind enough to read me off the selections.   I got exactly what I wanted,  on time.  I ended up splitting it with my two kids. They were way more interested in my dinner then pizza.  I split the rice and dinner between 3 of us and we are stuffed.   The veggies were perfectly done,  still crisp, the sauce was full of flavor and the chicken was the right size and tender!   I will definitely be trying other amazing things!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner-food was very good. But my review is centered around our server. His name is Forest and he was wonderful. He was courteous and respectful. What I mean by that is he allowed us time to drink our drinks and eat our appetizers and talk-he did not rush us to move on to placing our order for dinner. We don't always get that kind of service-people seem to want to rush you thru your dinner and turn over the table. Thanks to Forest we enjoyed our wonderful dinner at Flos and enjoyed the company we were with that night."}
{"text":"Although most of the food here is excellent, I come here for one reason and one reason alone... Hot and sour soup. I have been eating this soup for 10 years, literally the best soup I have ever had in my life. \"hot\" without being too spicy, the perfect amount of meat and tofu, the mushrooms in it are also amazing... the smell alone will clear your sinuses and cure you of your common cold. It's pure magic. Do yourself a favor, If you happen to visit Flo's GET THE SOUP. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place and had it on my list to try. After some shopping at Scottsdale quarter, we ventured up here to grab dinner. It was around 6:45pm during the week and we didn't have to wait for a table for 2. Score!  We were promptly given water, and then our waiter greeted us and said he would be right with us as the place was pretty busy. I don't mind a little slowness when it's crowded, as long as you give some acknowledgement, so I thank our waiter for being courteous!   We started with the crab puffs, which were very crisp and tasty. Probably would rank it as one of my favorites when it comes to crab rangoon/puffs. We ordered the crispy honey beef and Mongolian beef. The crispy honey beef is exactly how you would imagine.. crispy beef with some sort of honey sauce. A good mix of sweet and tangy that complimented the beef well! The Mongolian beef was some of the best my partner had ever had. We both chose white rice to accompany it and couldn't finish.. definitely got to take home lunch for the next day as the portions are very generous!  Our server was polite and attentive, getting us refills and offering to box our food for us. By the time we finished the meal the crowd had died down and the back of the restaurant was pretty empty.   I will definitely be returning to try some of the chicken and shrimp dishes!"}
{"text":"The service here is always great, but every time I go here I am disappointed by the taste of the food. Prepare for the whitest version of every dish you've ever had. I can honestly say I enjoy Panda Express more. The food is just as greasy. I give it a meh outta 5."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and inviting. Two stars for that. The food, bland and greasy. I have been to Chinese buffets with better food. Three people serving a table of 7 and not one knew who got what. My order was left out almost entirely until I reminded them what I ordered. By that time I couldn't remember. No drink order was taken or asked."}
{"text":"Great HH specials! The 7 of us ordered delicious cocktails and Tiger/Tsingtao beer...  Everyone enjoyed the lettuce wraps (chicken and tofu), wings (takes ~20min), crab puffs, Mongolian beef and spring rolls. Everything was tasty! It is newer so a slight wait on our server as it got more busy for HH and dinner. It is a cute place and cannot wait to use the patio when it gets cooler. Expect us to go there again!"}
{"text":"Very good. .. glad to see / eat  fresh hot food. Very polite and well kept. I will be back"}
{"text":"Flo's is a role model for other restaurants and this one is sure no exception. The service and the food  are consistently excellent. You can tell that the staff has been extensively trained in customer service so you leave as a happy customer.   My favourite item on the menu is the shrimp pad thai.   I also like the fact that they have lunch and dinner portions.  Some other reviews mention that this location will close within twelve months.  I strongly doubt it!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour daily from 3 til 7...Consistently excellent food and service...My favourites are: hot and sour soup, red curry chicken, chicken satay appetizer, mojito, shrimp pad thai...Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Their service was really bad. We got our appetizer almost 40 minutes after we ordered!! Also Their cocktails tasted more like juice than an alcoholic beverage! Overall not a very satisfying experience"}
{"text":"Like Christopher H., I think Flo's. Well, I think Flo's kinda blows actually. Great open, modern room. Quick and friendly service. Affordable prices But the food? Bland and predictable. Kinda like network television. Or a Will Smith movie. I gave the extra third star to Christopher's 2 because when I lived at DC Ranch, it was uber convenient. Cuz once I was holed up at home after a long day at work, dining choice were slim pickins. One huge reason I'm happier living in CenPho. The Mongolian Beef and spring rolls were my usual. And if they were fantastic, merely thinking of them should get my glands to salivate. But alas. No salivating. No Flo's. Adios and Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday during lunch with some co workers. I ordered the orange chicken with brown rice. Few others entrees looked delish and would like to try some different dishes even tho orange chicken is my fave. One hiccup a few of us ordered brown rice but they gave us all white rice. Anyways I would like to go back and try some lunch specials or maybe happy hours appetizers."}
{"text":"Best lettuce wraps anywhere. Best tom ka gai soup anywhere. Pad Thai Satay is so completely inauthentic, I mean COMPLETELY different than real Pad Thai, but you know what, it's so damned good that I could really care less, and order it almost every time I go there. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Second only to her other restaurant, Flo's Asian Kitchen, five miles down the road. I really wish she'd open a location closer to ASU, where I lived. Three of her four locations are all a stone's throw from one another, all in Scottsdale. They're all excellent, and all half an hour from where I live(d). The exception is the airport location, and don't even get me started on that mess..."}
{"text":"We had dinner with another couple at Flo's, based on the reviews we read here. Unfortunately, 2 stars is about all I can muster. The food was as lackluster as the service. Spring rolls were quite greasy (meaning they hadn't been drained adequately at best); and the four dishes we tried were distinctly uninspired. Flo's would certainly not be my first choice for Asian food in the Valley. And I doubt that anyone in our party will be returning. If you're searching for impressive Asian cuisine, skip this place."}
{"text":"I too have been a loyal fan of Flo's for more than a decade, eating here every week for awhile when I worked in the area. Sadly, I can't say I'll ever eat here again. It's true, prices have gone up and the quality and consistency has gone way down.  The boyfriend and I visited twice in the past couple weeks. The first time, the only thing we really liked was the white rice and General Tso's (spelling?) Chicken. It was sweet, savory & spicy. The other menu items were a fail. Spring rolls were tiny (like as long as my pinky finger!) and I believe $4 for just TWO. The brown rice was mushy and overcooked. The Orange Beef was bland. Their orange sauce is definitely not as good as I remember, which used to be my favorite.  The second visit, last night in fact, we ordered General Tso's Chicken and Mongolian Beef. Unfortunately, the brown rice was again overcooked. C'mon guys... if I can make good brown rice myself with a crappy $30 rice cooker, what is your excuse?! The General sauce lacked the spiciness of the previous visit and was just OK. The Mongolian sauce was good, but the beef was mushy. It seems like they might soak it in meat tenderizer for a LONG TIME. Very weird consistency.  Seriously pains me to say that I won't be back. Very sad.  :("}
{"text":"Food was bland service was good music was too loud. We hoped to find a new Chinese restaurant but this place won't make our list."}
{"text":"I like this location.  Flo is often here herself and does a good job of making the rounds though not to every table.  The sizzling rice soup was very flavorful - it \"sizzled\" unlike a recent experience I had elsewhere - and was chockablock full of veggies and chicken and shrimp. Yum!  The cinnamon shrimp was inspired! Really interesting flavor combinations. The chicken katsu was tasty.  Nice decor. Nice people. Clean. Fair pricing. Always happy here. A good alternative to the national chains.  Would have given up 5 stars if not for: a patron had a \"service\" dog. Now, I have no idea whether the person needed the animal or not. There was no indicator that the animal was \"in training.\" I'm not judging because these animals play an important role in our society. My objection (and I'll admit I do not know all there is to know about service animals and how people are to interact with them - or not) is this: the animal had its harness on and Flo and some servers were lavishing the belly-up dog with attention including aggressively petting it and letting it lick them. My understanding is: harness on = dog is working and should be left completely alone by everyone other than the handler; harness off = \"play time\" only with the handler's consent. And, this is a restaurant! So, hands off the animals because your hands are on peoples' food!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time trying Flo's. We arrived during happy hour so appetizers were half price and we ordered the crab puffs. I had the Kung \"Pow\" chicken and my husband had the orange chicken. We also had the chocolate won tons for dessert. I can't complain about the food. It was good. It was a large portion for the price and it was hot food. It was fine but unremakable. Didn't blow me away. What DID blow me away was the service. It was outstanding. Our bus boy was so great I gave him a tip. We were well taken care of and I would go back."}
{"text":"I came here for a girl's afternoon out with my boyfriend's cousin on a Saturday. We were pleasantly surprised to learn about the Saturday special. It was $6.00 at the time, but I've learned that the price has since risen to about $8.00.   This was my second time here and both times were good experiences.   Service: The service was solid. While there was nothing spectacular that happened, sometimes that's a good thing. The waitstaff are consistent with their smiles and politeness. They make you feel welcome even when the restaurant is very crowded. My water and iced tea were filled up constantly.   Food: Flo's is made out to be a fusion-type place, but we chose meals that were pretty standard: a red curry and a chicken stir-fry. I'd say that the quality and authenticity of the food was somewhere between a fast-food place and a home style restaurant. I would eat here again. The Saturday special started with a salad before the actual entrée was served.   Ambiance: It's fancier than most Chinese restaurants. You could come here for a business lunch, or just a lunchtime date in shorts and a t-shirt and you wouldn't feel out of place. It's clean too which I really appreciate.   I'd come back here."}
{"text":"Appetizers are 4 stars pretty good for Asian food. The entrée are blegh :( tried it twice and both times the noodles tasted oily and beef was gamey. In the end I will not return except happy hr."}
{"text":"Seriously--it is as good as it gets!  Even my 3 and 1 year old sons loved it! I couldn't believe how fresh everything was.  I'm usually not a fan of Asian cuisine because it usually tastes processed and too salty for my liking.  But we tried 7 different dishes at Flo's and every single one was cooked fresh and seasoned to perfection.  The staff was friendly and attentive as well.  Can't wait for our next experience there."}
{"text":"I met my buddy MT here for lunch. He suggested it and I'm glad he did. I like this place, a lot. First, it's beautiful. Well, if modern colors and lines with a contemporary feel is beautiful to you, this is the place. I liked it the minute we walked in the door. We were greeted immediately and taken to our table. Our server, Blaze, was soon at our table taking our drink orders. $2.50 for ice tea is spot on. Very good green tea I would like to say. MT ordered the Shu Mai ($6) to start. Lovely little steamed pork dumpling. Full of tasty puree'd pork with a ramekin of sweet & spicy dipping sauce. A tad salty but overall this was a great start to our lunch. MT ordered the House Pan Fried Noodles ($9). He said his lunch was good. I was impressed that our entree's came with a small house salad. Nothing special but for the price this little add on was perfect. I ordered the Lo Mein ($8.50) subbing in Thin Rice Noodles with a mix of Vegetables and Roasted Pork. The noodles were delish, the veggies were a combo of steamed broccoli, zuchinni, bean sprouts and napa cabbage. The pork was long strips, seasoned fine but a tad overcooked. In addition was a half baseball size pile of brown rice. All in all a very good dish. Lots of Gluten Free items on the menu as well as Spicy and/or Vegetarian choices. Happy days. Great Service, really good food, fair prices (lunch), beautiful space. 4 Stars"}
{"text":"FINALLY - a sit-down place @ Promenade that knows how to handle a lunch-time business crowd.  We were in awe watching everyone move and dance and flutter around the dining room like a well-rehearsed balet.  It was amazing!  Within 40 seconds of sitting down, we had salad, wontons and water in front of us.  All in all, we were in and out of there in about 35 minutes.  Flo - PLEASE go to your neighbors at Pasta Primo and show them how it's done!  As far as the food is concerned, perfect lunch sized portions.  I had the pepper bacon shrimp (or something to that effect) and it was very tasty.  My co-worker thought it was spicy peppers, but it was coarsely ground black peppercorns.  A unique flavor and very well put together.  My co-worker had the garlic chicken and she was happy with the dish.    All in all, a positive lunch experience @ Promenade.  They know how to do lunch there at Flo's!"}
{"text":"Flo's is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale.  The best time to go is for Lunch at 2:50pm.  Lunch special reduces the cost buy a couple bucks and comes with crunchy chips and an asian salad.  Chicken is very well prices ($7.50) which includes the chips and salad. Lunch special ends at 3 so get there a little before, but happy hour begins at 3 (2 for 1 appetizers and drinks) so I try to time it so I get both.  They do take out and have great sized dinner proportions.  Everything is good.  My favorites are the kung pow (mandarin) chicken, teriyaki chicken, sweat and sour chicken, mongolian beef, broccoli and beaf, dan dan noodles, shrimp lo mein.  Everything is good."}
{"text":"Funny that I saw other comments that are the exact same reason I only give this location 1 stars. Our server was Katie. She was nowhere to be found most of the time. She didn't seem to care that we were one of her tables at all. I had to chase someone down to get water for our table as we were there for about 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged. When we finally met Katie, she took our orders and disappeared again. Our food took forever to get to us and came out a plate at a time instead of all together.   My friend ordered a glass of wine and she brought her the wrong (more expensive) one and my friend didn't catch it until she saw her bill. When we told her about the mistake, she talked to her manager and had it fixed but said \"pay more attention next time\". Great customer service, lady. We were there for two hours (because it took us way too long to get our food) and saw Katie probably 4 times. This is one of many negative reviews I saw for Katie and she still works there.. go figure.   Love the Tempe location, but I'll never go to the Scottsdale one again."}
{"text":"Best Asian food I've had in a long time. I love it that it is right around the corner. This place is always full when I go, even though I always get take out. I get the Mongolian beef, which is amazing. I definitely recommend this place to everyone I know if they are in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing! I'm not a typical Asian food lover. Its something I have to be in the mood for. I was in the area at a doctor's appointment and I asked the office where I could find some good healthy food and they said Flo's, right across the street.  I figured I would try it but never expected to find the best Asian food I've ever had! If you want fresh food, excellent service, a large menu, a well kept/ clean, good prices - place to eat - try Flo's. You will not be disappointed! Thank you Stephanie for taking such good care of us. You are wonderful. We will be back to experience more yummys!"}
{"text":"I used to go to her Scottsdale location and it was always very good.  The Tempe location is equally good, excellent service as well.  So l am so glad Flo is also on this side of the valley!  I'd like to give it a also a 5 star  but the warmth is lacking at the Tempe location.  The bar had the most annoying speakers right above our heads. We asked to move to another table.  Now past this element, l highly recommend Flo!  They have Happy Hour every day (great choices from their starter plates) and fantastic cocktails or top shelf choices at 1/2 prices.  You can bet that dish you will order will be outstanding."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food.  Service was great.  Shrimp Phö was tasty and had a ton of shrimp.   They don't have the phö soup spoons though so you just get a small soup spoon - can't make the perfect bite with it!  Hubby had the chicken Katsu and subbed plain white rice - he loved it.  So, yeah, we were happy!  Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Katie is the best. We have been coming here since they were in DC Ranch. She always acknowledges how much my kids have grown over 10 years. We live near the Flos on FLW but always travel further to see Katie. The food is excellent the service is better. Happy Hours are the best!  Try the FloMo pineapple drinks. If your not sure what you want, Katie will recommend and you will never be disappointed. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Service was top shelf, but the kitchen let the hard working wait staff down.   We ordered the lettuce cups, which were solid. Had I known what was to come, I would have stopped right there.  Entrees were Fried Honey Beef and Sizzling Rice Soup, both bordered on inedible. The beef was fried to the point of being devoid of any moisture whatsoever. Effectively beef jerky when it reached the table. The soup should be retitled \"wet chicken with stale rice crispies\". No flavor at all. I should have known when the sizzling rice didn't sizzle when dropped in.  This place gets lots of good reviews, so maybe I caught them on a bad day, but this meal wasn't even in the ballpark of decent.  2 stars because the waiters really did try hard. The only way they could have provided better service would have been to warn me and the entrees to come and helped me bail out after the appetizer."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about Flo's restaurants, so imagine the excitement I felt when I saw Flo's Asian Kitchen across the shopping center at dinner time!    We decided to check it out and, to sum it all up, the service was fantastic, but the food was a bit of a let down.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I didn't find any of the dishes to be anything more than average.  The sauce with the crispy & spicy chicken was salty and lacked any real heat.  The chicken itself was prepared fine, but it was not unlike any other chicken breast that has been pounded, breaded in panko and fried.  The green curry was good, but I there was not enough coconut milk in the recipe and the dish was very heavy on the onion.  I also wished there was more of the green curry sauce....lots more.  The service is what redeemed this visit.  We were greeted and then seated immediately after we entered the establishment.  Waters were brought to us with out having to ask, including a small cup with a lid for our daughter.  Our server was completely on the ball with taking orders, refilling drinks and checking back with us to make sure we were taken care of.  The service she provided was good enough that I might be willing to give Flo's Asian Kitchen another go....maybe."}
{"text":"Love, love this place for good Asian food. The atmosphere is a good place for a first date or nice evening out with your sweetie or girls day with your bffs."}
{"text":"its hidden away in a shopping area but once you enter the decor is very nice (totally did not expect it). we were seated immediately during happy hour and there werent too many people there. our waitress greeted us with a smile, informed us of the specials and took our drink orders. she returned promptly and took our food order (even the steamed carrots we specially ordered for the little one). the crab rangoons were small but very tasty. he ordered the yakisoba w/chicken and i went for the teppanyaki beef over flour noodes--both were very good and filling! the waitress came over and check on us a few times then brought us our check as soon as we asked for it. since we were using a Groupon we weren't able to take advantage of the happy hour specials (1/2 off apps & drinks)--we'll def be back to try those!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Flo's in North Scottsdale since I was a kid, so when I saw their sign up in Tempe, I got pretty excited. I told my friend we had to come here for happy hour because they have fantastic deals - half off almost all apps and half off all drinks, yes ALL drinks... awesome! I had the mandarin oriental and my friend had the tytini. Her drink was... odd. It wasn't bad, but it didn't taste like anything I have tried before. My drink was very tasty, sweet, but not overly so, and easy to drink. For 4.50, you can't beat it. We also decided to get 3 apps, which have been very delicious at the other location including the pork potstickers, the spicy/limey Lao lettuce wraps, and the spring rolls. The Lao lettuce wraps were as tasty as I remembered... I like how the chicken has a lot of flavor from the chilies, lime, and spices and it's especially good with some potsticker sauce on top. The other two apps were horrible failures. The potstickers up north are typically fried, these were steamed, which isn't a problem except they tasted... off. Like something about them was bad. They were inedible and we left them behind (which is kind of a big deal if you know me because A. potstickers/dumplings are one of my favorite foods and B. I never leave food behind, either it's eaten or boxed). The spring rolls were greasy and flavorless. I hope the lack of deliciousness was due to the restaurant just opening. Regardless, I would return for happy hour drinks if nothing else."}
{"text":"What happened Flo's? I have been coming to Flo's for many years, even had my sister in law's baby shower there (which was great and affordable!). I was in the shopping center today and decided to pick up some of their delicious wonton soup for dinner, as I have a bit of a cold, and I always liked their pork wontons, the delicious julienned ginger and carrots, the spinach, the shaved garlic....perfection for wonton soup. I got home and opened the soup....what is this?!?!?! It was like the generic wonton soup you get at any take out place or from the frozen aisle. It had thick cut carrots and 3 peas, but no other veg, no scallions, no ginger, no garlic. The wontons were like shrimp balls....I don't like shrimp and was expecting pork. This soup was not even a shadow of what I have had here before and was not good. I am so disappointed. I don't know if this is due to it being take out (which would be ridiculous) or if they ran out of their normal soup (slightly better) or they changed their soup completely to this bland garbage (worst case scenario). I was thoroughly disappointed and won't come back soon."}
{"text":"I always love to dine at Flo's!  If you have several friends-even better-so you can dine family style and share such satisfying dishes as Mu Shu Pork, Orange Beef, Sweet and Sour Chicken.  It is speedy service-so great for a quick lunch.  HH is also 3-7 daily.  Works for me!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day since it's down the street from my work.   I ordered the chicken Katsu. Instead of white rice it actually comes with friend rice which I thought was a good twist. The Katsu was good. Remember this isn't Onos or L&L so you're not going to get the best Katsu ever. But it was good. For drinks I got the Mandarin Oriental. Omg! For $9 a drink, you definitely get your money's worth. I actually thought it was a bit too strong. Each sip was like taking a shot each time.   I thought their dishes were a bit pricey. We're talking around $12 a plate. It would be nice if they had lunch specials. They have a very big menu so there's definitely a lot of items to try."}
{"text":"Our dinner started out a bit rocky, but then got better.  My friend and I ordered some potstickers, and they were just ok, very small. They came with our dinner. I told the server I didn't like peppers, and she said I could order the vegetables I wanted, so I ordered the pork with eggplant, no peppers, but with broccoli instead. When everything came, my friend's tatsu chicken was good, but my dish came with green peppers. We asked the busboy to bring sweet and sour sauce and brown rice, but he never came back. When the server came to check on dinner, I told her about the peppers so she took it back. She asked if jalapenos were ok, and I said definitely NOT! It should say on the menu that there are jalapenos in the dish. When I finally got it, it was very good, and she brought me brown rice on the side.  Fairly good food, with some snafus in the beginning! Would I go back? Possibly"}
{"text":"Food was average and I was rushed to leave because of the time, couldn't really relax and enjoy my food because staff wanted to go home.  I asked about the hot wings and she said they would take about 20 minutes and they were closing down and about 30 even though I had told her that I had come to try them. Ended up ordering something I didn't really want, and they kept coming to my table it was annoying. More than likely will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy geesh this place is amazing. So many gluten free options! Healthy too! So good. Coming back for sure. Happy to have this place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Got the Panang curry, Thai basil chicken, and the chocolate won tons for dessert. So good! I'm a curry critic (love my green and panang) and I liked this one. Would go again and love that it close to my house. Nice ambiance as well."}
{"text":"11:53A... 20 people standing outside waiting for restaurant to open at noon and staff inside laughing and dancing.  POOR customer experience."}
{"text":"We have yet to be disappointed  in Flo's after at least 30 visits to this restaurant. My favorite starter is the calamari with peppers. The batter is so light on this dish and the spices have just the right amount of zip. I have never tasted calamari done better than Flo's. The service is always prompt and friendly. The dining room almost always seems to be full and everyone around us looks very happy. Flo's has to be doing something right to be so busy. Some of our other favorite dishes are the coconut chicken soup, a delicious classic Thai dish or the spring rolls. Any of the stir fry dishes are exceptional and I can honestly say we have never had an entree or appy we haven't thoroughly enjoyed. Flo's is one of the most consistent if not THE most consistent restaurant in the Valley. I do miss the yummy almond cookies they used to serve with your check but the fortune cookies are still a fun way to finish up a great meal and what a value. Two can dine for $20.00 easily and go home with leftovers. Compared to P.F. Chang's ( I am not a Chang's fan) Flo's is a winner."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Haply hour is excellent! The long islands.. NICE!! Everything i have had on the menu has been great. Really enjoy the staff."}
{"text":"Impressively, every single dish was excellent and our waiter Doni was really nice. My husband and I love the Spicy Chicken Basil , Kung Pao Chicken and the crispy vegetable & chicken egg rolls are fantastic. The food was fresh and has a lot of flavor. We enjoyed it. You should check it out... Highly recommend!!! Thanks Doni!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch- haven't been for YEARS and remember it being good when it opened.  MEH.  Lunch salad was a handful of lettuce from a bag with some ok dressing on it.  I had the red curry- ok taste, but lacked sauce and the chicken was ICK.  Slimy almost and fatty- not even sure it was real chicken. No spring roll included- just some crispy won ton strips.  Totally disappointed.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place because it had good reviews but this food was completely bland and tasteless.  As an appetizer I had the spicy wontons which were not spicy at all but had more flavor than anything else I ate. Service was good.  It was a bit pricey and no flavor.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's one of two Flo's within about five miles (the other is at the Scottsdale Promenade, and from what I understand the menu/focus is somewhat different).  This one is at McDowell Mountain Village (same strip mall as an AJ's)  kind of a corporate hangout for people who work in the area, like myself.   They've recently changed and expanded the menu a bit, and it includes more vegetarian options (yay!) I especially enjoy the Crispy Tofu and Vegetables. Each meals comes with a green salad with the world's most delicious dressing -- kind of spicy, kind of sweet. The wontons with dipping sauce are also delish.   Service is quick and friendly. Parking can be an issue, and the place fills up fast during weekday lunch hours."}
{"text":"This review is a tad jaded as we went there on Christmas Eve and the wait was long!  We waited well over 30 minutes and they do not provide device to summon one back once table was ready so we had to hang around the front door. While the food was good the noise level was horrid and made table talk almost impossible."}
{"text":"It's odd that this excellent restaurant is classified as Chinese, as it's really pan-southeast-Asian, with standard Chinese dishes being rounded out by Thai curries, pad Thai and Pho. Everything I've ever had here is outstanding. They are always busy but somehow manage to get you into a table without much waiting. Flo herself is often there and mingles with the customers. She obviously cares that you're enjoying your meal. There's a real pride of ownership."}
{"text":"Having been to the Scottsdale location about 6 months ago we gave this location a try. Straight-up, it was LOUD including screaming kids on a Saturday @6pm (PEAK). Our server was great and tended to recommend veggie dishes, which this body could use more of. I had the Yuxiang Pork with eggplant per our server's suggestion...great, with a delicious sauce! The menu is quite varied including Curry's & Thai options. Happy Hour will get you ridiculous prices for Apps & Drinks....think, 21.6oz TsingTao beers @ $3!!! plus crab puffs & pot stickers as well for half price!....our party easily over ate apps and were then presented with family sized entrees. I tend to judge chinese places by the Hot & Sour soup...in this case, Excellent!  I say plan on sharing or over eating, your choice."}
{"text":"I liked the layout, it was spacious. It was busy but that was to be expected for a Sat. lunch. Seems all the dishes were $6 for some reason that was good because they were not worth $8-$9 as printed on the menu. You get a salad starter which was tasty. You also get a big pile of rice, like half the plate. I ordered the Twice cooked pork. It was marked as Hot & Spicy but was not. It was decent but most of the veggies needed to be cut smaller. Oh, I'm not a fan of Green peppers and they sure do use A LOT of those.......simply 3 stars for me nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"I used to come here a long time ago when I worked up here on rain tree and the 101.  It's been atleast 5-6 years. Best thing about this place is that it has not changed a bit with the quality of food and service. I really enjoyed this place, atmosphere, friendly service, quick food. We got here when it opened so it was not busy yet, but people started rolling in right away. I ordered my all time favorite teriyaki chicken and some crab puffs. Both were exceptional. I will be coming back regularly since I work in the area again. I recommend trying it out, it might not be your kind of place. But see for yourself, you shouldn't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"One of the managers at my job decided to treat us to Flo's for lunch yesterday. I practically did cartwheels in my aisle because a) I was determined to eat out on my Friday and b) I love Flo's. I can't recall if anything I have eaten there was subpar. I ordered the Pepper Bacon Shrimp which is mixed with tomatos, cabbage, and bacon. With this you can choose between white or brown rice, and it comes with their house salad. The dressing is spicy and unique. They also bring out wontons with a sweet and sour sauce. Between those and my affinity for chips and salsa, I will never have a six pack. Anyhoo, service there is speedy without you feeling rushed. That place runs like a well-oiled machine. It is nice when you go during your lunch hour because you are in and out within the hour, usually. My husband says their Mongolian Beef is the best he has ever had and since he comes from the Seattle with plenty of Asian food, I believe him. There lunches are on average $7-9. Not bad considering the amount of food you get. I can usually make a second meal with my leftovers. I wish they would bring a Flo's down to Central Phoenix so I could have it more often."}
{"text":"We were promptly seated by the hostess.  The place is decorated with both modern and ancient Chinese caligraphies that dates back to to Chin dynasty.  We order pot stickers (very finely presented), seafood soup (superb), but their entrees were weak.  Ma po tofu is a Chinese signature dish that ultimately test the chef's ability to paint their flavour but it was way too salty for my taste.  The red curry didn't have the spice that I am looking for but if you like the Japanese/Korean style curry then it would be ok.  We were served by four different servers with more attention by the bus lady since she came by several times to fill the water but the waiters who presented dishes were not attentive and left me to fill my soups.   I will have to alter the food at home with chicken broth to soften the sodium content.  My friend said it was ok but I couldn't eat it.  They didn't offer to package the food for us either and the place wasn't busy..Hmmm.  Am I expecting too much?"}
{"text":"Been here Numerous times we enjoy the food and service has always been great, I am a big fan of thier Chicken Katsu and their fried rice is one of the best in the Valley...Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My first Flo's experience as I do not live in this area. Pretty good Chinese. Not your typical east coast cantonese stuff. Black bean shrimp, beef & broccoli. beef wide noodle and soups were good. Fried rice is the white style fried rice so not my favorite. Really wanted to like the BBQ pork buns but was disappointed. Not white puffy dough but more like a jewish egg roll. I could deal with that but just was not all that tasty.  Pricey bot not outside normal Scottsdale prices."}
{"text":"Ordered food2go got home was very low quality and wasn't happy about my meal for the price"}
{"text":"Walking distance from my house. Great portions. Great HH prices. Full bar. Spacious environment. I dig this place."}
{"text":"Let me be clear...the service at Flo's is wonderful. I ordered the Edamame, Spring Rolls and Won Ton Soup.  The Edamame was cooked well, but was just salted and needed garlic or something. The Spring Rolls were just ground chicken with really no vegetables or too little to make out. The texture of just ground style meat was not appetizing. The Won Ton was a huge portion and had large won tons with a whole shrimp which was nice, but they were too big for your mouth and too hard to chase in the broth to cut. I tried to just bite one on the spoon, but it was difficult. The iced tea was excellent!  I REALLY wanted to love the food since the staff was so wonderful, but it just wasn't what I expected."}
{"text":"I have to admit at first I was pretty apprehensive but it turned out to be a pleasant experience food is pretty pricey but well worth it Large portions my overall experience was great I would recommend for some good Asian food"}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!!! This is a newer place in Tempe, a sister property of the one in North Scottsdale.  Having been to the Scottsdale location I was hoping for good things when I saw the Tempe location opened in the Whole Foods complex.  They did not disappoint!  Food is extremely fresh, Asian flair, I had the Pad Thai with shrimp, calamari (not great) but overall a very good experience with good staff!  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Tasty Chinese (Asian cuisine) at an affordable price!  Living here in the valley, I have always struggled to find Chinese food that isn't greasy, but also isn't over the top expensive. Flo's is it! Tried it out last night and everything we ordered was delicious. Sizzling rice soup was especially good, and I would highly recommend the beef chow fun.   Service was a bit slow, but it may have been because they were so busy.   I will go back!"}
{"text":"As a  a long time Flo's customer the new layout of this location is horrible. The hostess stand has been moved to the side allowing waiting  customers to flow into the dining room and lean against your table while you're eating.     Absolutely refuse the first table behind the hostess stand it is a miserable experience. When I complained about it Flo said its because they were busy. Well on my job when I earn the money that I spend at flos I can't provide poor customer service just because we are busy. Bottom line with flos is they have gotten too big,  making money is more important that the client experience.   Find another establishment until they put clients first"}
{"text":"Flo's is my favorite place to get Chinese in the valley. This location, especially. I am not a fan of the one in the promenade... The hot and sour soup here is AH-MAY-ZING. Oh my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The broth. The pork. The shrimp. The mushrooms. Sooooo good. I hate when I order hot and sour soup from a restaurant and it tastes like salty beef broth with peas and carrots and those canned bamboo shoot things. I also hate when it's the consistency of jello. But Flo's is always perfect. Just the amount of spice and vinegar, the perfect thickness, perfect amount of egg that's actually stirred in correctly and not just giant globs...  Their other dishes I've had are good too. The ingredients are fresh. Their noodle dishes are pretty basic tho, so if you like tons of ingredients, maybe don't get one. I however think they're delicious. My only real complaint about Flo's is the service. Everyone always seems extremely stressed out, from the hostesses to the servers. Maybe they need a few more employees? But it's not a big deal for me, I usually just get take out. Or lunch. And it's actually great for lunch, super fast, and fresh, and you totes get your money's worth!!"}
{"text":"That was hilarious! The bartender's response wasn't what I expected. I post a lot of pics to social media that people enjoy. They say I have a great skill to \"capture the shot.\" (Decide for yourself if my pics are good, IG: @jefferythomas)  When I first saw the lighting of the bar backdrop, I knew I had something I could work with. After dinner I ask the bartender if I could take a pic. Asking permission is really just a polite way of telling him that I need him to move out of the shot.  My idea of collecting raw shots that I could crop, manipulate and edit for the enjoyment of others was crushed with an abrupt and stern \"No! We don't allow photography inside!\"  I've never heard such a response to that question. I've never ask that question in a Chinese restaurant either.  Being so surprised, I had to pry into why. We've all heard the rumors of what constitutes Chinese restaurant food. He offered to go ask the owner if it was OK. Yeah, don't waste my time getting the confirmation \"No!\"  I'll pass. No pics posted supporting and promoting you guys.  Besides, I didn't like the dried out rice anyway."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a Labor Day dinner. I've been to Flo's Promenade and I've gotta say that the flavors are much better at this restaurant. Authentic Chinese food and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Always solid choice. Had beef and broccoli pepper chicken and Kung Pow Chicken.  Spring rolls just so so"}
{"text":"I would give Flo's 3.5 stars if I could.  Best brown rice I've had from a restaurant.  Consistently the hottest hostesses from lunch to dinner too.  Sometimes she has a really hot bartender girl too.    One of my favorite places for lunch - super fast service, and a lot of food for the money.  Also one of my regular places to bring home take-out from.  It's super-duper awesome Chinese take-out food.  That's not really saying a lot though.  None of the food here, besides the rice, is really all that great.  The only thing I've ever had from Flo's that was gross, though, was the Teriyaki Chicken.  It smelled totally disgusting.  Everything else though - pretty good but not great.  This particular Flo's is extremely ear-shatteringly loud when full.  Don't expect to carry on any sort of conversation in here at lunch."}
{"text":"I came here during HH so I could try a lot of different appetizers.  I ordered the shumai dumplings, Lao style lettuce cups, and calamari.  I thought everything was great!  The lettuce cups came with a LOT of chicken.  I think it was enough for about 4 people to share that appetizer.  My friend got the spicy wontons, shrimp skewers, and vegetable dumplings.  I tried those and they were also good!  But the spicy wontons weren't noticeably spicy at all.  I like that they take online reservations, even for Saturdays.  I'll definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"I frequent here because the location is very convenient. Some of the entrees are really good but some aren't. Their wonton soup, Thai chicken basil, lettuce cup, and Mongolian beef are good here. I didn't care for their curry dishes and chow mein.  The restaurant and the restroom is very clean and service is spot on. It gets busy here but never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This Flo's is located in the AJ's shopping center. It has larger dining room than the scottsdale road location. I love how clean and well decorated this restaurant is. The same goes for their other locations.   The garlic chicken lunch was absolute delicious and very satisfying. Had perfect amount of chicken to vegetables.  The Lao Style chicken lettuce cup, on the other hand, was very disappointing. It tasted like they just chopped  bunch of leftovers and threw some random sauce on it. It was salty and sour...just couldn't figure out what it was supposed to taste like. I've had their regular chicken lettuce cups in the past at this very location and remember it being quite good. Hence the 4 stars.  I'd recommend skipping on the Lao's style and go for the regular one.   The staff were friendly and efficient. We were out the door for lunch on a Tuesday in about 30 minutes. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food and a great happy hour. Half price appetizers from 3-7. Kimmy is a great bartender and always there with a smile and there to serve. Good Job!!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here just recently for the first time. The food was really good,  the service was OK. When food was being brought out the servers had table numbers messed up, we would have other peoples food be brought by our table asking if it was ours. I wasnt over joyed with the service but the food was awesome and we still enjoyed our selves none the less."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and an outstanding happy hour menu price list! Husband has picked up takeout for lunch from here a couple of times and said it was good. We stopped by tonight and ordered 4 apps and beers and our bill was incredibly reasonable due to happy hour. We had dumplings, calamari, shrimp skewers and pork slices. They were all yummy! We will definitely return when in the neighborhood. Thanks Flo's!"}
{"text":"I just ate at Flo's and the service was amazing! The food was delicious and the ambiance was really nice."}
{"text":"Flo's offers good Chinese and Asian cuisine with friendly service at decent prices. Stand-out dishes: pine nut shrimp, red curry chicken (I get it with the yellow curry veggies + add water chestnuts - per the recommendation of a waiter), and orange beef. It can get very noisy when busy in the evenings. Happy hour pricing is good with mostly fried food options. It's fun to sit at the bar and grab a couple of drinks and dishes. I wish they offered vegetable fried rice as an option to accompany dishes for a reasonable upcharge instead of a whopping $8. Lunch is served with an included small iceberg lettuce salad (nothing to write home about) and I usually leave still hungry. Dinner portions are larger and more filling. Lots of gluten-free and dairy-free options on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband Todd and I were on a night on the town and decided to try out Flos. Boy was I surprised. Service was tremendous and I could not feel more welcome. Our bartender Cole was very friendly and made an excellent mai tai. We talked about professional scooter riding for a bit and were astonished that he was famous. Our food came at a very reasonably time and Collin was very cute and friendly. Our pot stickers were top notch. We will definitely be coming back to Flos!"}
{"text":"The customer service here was beyond amazing. I never ordered food from here and the gentleman at the desk explained everything and was so kind!"}
{"text":"The lunch portions are big and will give them that , but the service not so much! The only service we got from the waiter was taking our order and bring our check. I ordered orange chicken and a kids meal . Both good but nothing to wow about . I asked for a kids water with a straw and I never got it. The waiter asked me 20 minutes later if I still want that water. The food came at a reasonable amount of time , however they didn't bring the extra napkins that I asked for which is imperative when dining with children. It took another 10-15 minutes to get our check after the plates gone away . I put in $20 for a $15 bill and I was planning to tip 20%.  I waited another 10 minutes for my change to come back since the waiter was doing other things. He came back and asked if  wanted change and I said yes because there is no way I'm leaving a $5 tip for crappy service .  Then it took another 10-15 minutes to get my change. All i can say that will be my last time at Flo's."}
{"text":"I went to Flo's a few years back on a business meeting, and the taste of cuisine stuck in my head. I don't know why I waited 2 years to come back to this place, but I'm glad I did.  Oh it was one Friday night and I was having a bad hankerin for some Orange Chicken. Peaked on their menu online, and what-do-you-know? Chili Orange Chicken!  My boyfriend and I showed up at roughly 630pm, and was seated promptly. Ordered some sodas, beef/pork potstickers, and was not disappointed.   The potstickers were wrapped in a thick wrapper, and tasted almost of sausage. Nicely spiced, sided with a soy sauce and a garlic chili sauce. For my dinner I ordered my plate of Orange Chicken was around 11 dollars. It was enough to feed 2.  Came out with a bowl (side) of rice (choice of brown or white), hot and steamy. Let's just say I needed a to-go-box.  I'll be back to Flo's and make it my new Chinese food staple.  Half off appetizers from 3pm - 7pm 7 days a week. Our appetizer of 6 meaty delicious potstickers was $2.50. I mean, c'mon now! Flo's is the ish."}
{"text":"Worst spring rolls (thick rice paper and no veggies). Even though the service was great, the food was just expensive fast food Chinese."}
{"text":"I think Flo's deserves a 5 Star Rating! I have been frequenting this place for over 5 years now and they have maintained a consistentcy in both menu options, flavor of food and price! I cannot stand going back to a restaurant where they have changed their cook and the favorite dish is no longer on the menu, or it taste totally different (and usually in the 'not so good' category) than what I remembered, and on top of it, the prices have gone up $2 or $3 dollars!!!! Good Lawd!  . . .   Flo's Asian Kitchen has been good to me! One thing I would like to add also, is that in the 5 years that I have been going to the Promenade location, I have seen veteran staff members! Which means that Flo's must be a great working environment as well! The service has always been great!   I recommend the Chow Fun w/chicken & shrimp, or the spicy chow mein noodles. The lettuce wraps are a great choice if you are trying to cut down on the carbs! The menu is Asian diversity perfect!"}
{"text":"So after being a patron for over 10+ years, I can definitely say  . . . Flo Girl? Ya'll losing it! The location on FLW & Thompson Peaks looks real nice and all but the food is not reflecting the flavor, presentation or taste you used to serve! I decided to try one of the winter specials and ordered the Spicy Beef & Basil Fried Rice! Where's the basil??? General folks would be saying, where's the beef? But there wasn't a lack of beef just basil! No basil or basil flavor present in that rice no where!  If I wanted beef fried rice, I would have just gotten that! Okay??!!!  . . .Then, I ordered Shrimp with Lobster Sauce and got Egg Drop soup with some added shrimp! I kid you not!!!! That chef ain't fooling me! I knows what you did!  Not that cost is an issue cause you gonna spend $30+ when you eat at Flo's! At least I do and generally gadly so! But I paid $15 dollars for some soup that cost $5. It's principal ya'll!  Yes! I got credited for that order honey! Hahahahaha . . .Trying to play me! Huh! . . .Over the years prices have gone up as it does everywhere else, but I always felt the food was complimentary to price! Maybe a little under priced!  But Flo, ya'll got me scratching my head and wondering what the hell is going on over there!  Get it together!  I see some major decline in business in your future honey!!!! I am telling you the truth cause I love ya!"}
{"text":"Really poor service at the bar. Girl was obviously new but nobody offered her any support. Waited 30min to get another drink, at a 15 seat bar.  Food is good, but service and teamwork there is extremely poor."}
{"text":"Always a great experience, we do take outs a lot and these guys are always amaze me with how fast and attentive they are. Food is always so tasty and steaming hot! All sorts of delicious meat with fresh crispy veggies and the juiciest sauces! And I'm a huge fan of their chicken wings, so yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious Asian food. Randomly came in for a quick dinner. Everything tastes very fresh and portions were large. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had the Thai style catfish and it was so delicious. It has a sauce that resembles curry although it's not exactly like it. The fried rice it's absolutely delicious... I will definitely be coming back for more! Lindsay is excellent! Kevin, the store Manager made sure our meals were timely and our experience a great one! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had the Red Chicken Curry. The flavors were amazing! Never had curry that good. Everything seemed really fresh and cooked perfectly. There are plenty great dishes that you can chose from and the service was great. Ill defiantly be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Flo's is a nice little spot with friendly service. As for the food- It depends on what you order. We got our last order to go and the girl at the front was very pleasant. We had crab puffs which are decadently delicious, and pork pot stickers which also were very good. We ordered a ginger dish that  originally was supposed to have beef but we substituted chicken. It was pretty tasty with nice slim pieces of chicken.  The orange chicken had a lot of breading on it and was served separately from the orange sauce, which I didn't really care for. The spicy shrimp dish we had was really tasty but came with absolutely raw broccoli.  Four dishes and two appys for just over $70 did seem a little pricey."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on twice-cooked pork, chicken katsu, and pork pot-stickers.  Wife and I were most impressed by the good flavor profiles on the 2X pork and chicken katsu. (We liked that they used fusion flavors, not just the standard bland Chinese take-out seasonings we've experienced with other locals). Pot-stickers were small but OK. I would order take-out from Flo's again, for sure. I award this restaurant 5 * on flavor! Look forward to trying other dishes.  Also, I arrived at 5:00 pm on a Tuesday afternoon in mid-May, the bar seats were full for happy-hour and the restaurant had about seven 4-tops in play. That's a good sign, I think, especially as seasonal tourists are mostly absent."}
{"text":"I crave Flos sizzling rice soup! I have not had a dish here that I didn't like. The ambiance is nice, very clean. It can get a little loud and crowded, but they have take out if you are wanting to avoid any crowds."}
{"text":"Great food, huge restaurant and clean atmosphere. Server was basically there just to take our order so I'm hoping they tip out their bussers well. Never had to worry about being thirsty because the guy was always there to refill our glasses. The portions were huge, we were able to split the curry dish along with the lettuce wrap and the fried calamari. We even took it home for leftovers. Food came out fast and everything was absolutely delicious, I'd come back definitely."}
{"text":"Third time I've been here and second time they've messed up! Went here for lunch today with a coworker and ended up asking for our food to go because it took them the entire hour to make two chicken dishes. Get back to the office to find my order isn't even right! I ordered lemon sauce chicken but instead got katsu chicken. One of the worst dining experiences of my life!!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place for years but didn't try it until my wife said she wanted to try it. This review applies to all three locations -- Thompson Peak, Scottsdale Promenade and Tempe. I've been to the Thompson Peak location the most.  I had eaten here many times and tried various dishes and wasn't all that impressed. Then on one visit I discovered one of the best dishes I've ever eaten -- the Spicy Ginger and Onion Beef on white rice. This is the most flavorful thing I've ever eaten and sometimes the peppers (not sure if they're Thai peppers or small Jalapeños) are really intense but I like it that way.  Years ago they used to have $5 lunch specials and you could have pretty much any dish on the menu, including salad and a bowl of wonton chips. This place was always packed and had lines of people waiting for them to open. Sounds good for business but I always wondered how they could make any money. That deal changed to a $6 lunch special and they still give you a salad but only a few wonton chips on the side with your entree. I don't even know if they have the lunch special anymore since the last several times I've been there hasn't been during Saturday lunch. Dinner portions are larger and more expensive but you don't get a salad for some reason.  There used to be a Flo's in Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor International Airport a few years ago; it was right before you went through security. I kinda wish it was still there for the times I've had to sit at the airport waiting for my flight.  I would give this place 5 stars but occasionally my favorite dish has been a little overcooked (including crab wontons on one occasion) or a bit off, lacking the flavor it usually has. On one occasion we had a really rude waitress at the Promenade location. She brought us our food and before my wife could even taste the Lemon Chicken she had ordered asked us how everything was. That particular dish seemed a bit off as she had ordered it before but our waitress never came back to the table until about 30 minutes later and when we told her about the food she said \"why didn't you say something before now?\" It's because you disappeared for 30 minutes you twit. My wife refuses to go to that location anymore although we went back once after getting no service at the Cantina Laredo across the street (see my other review).  However, more often than not we've had a great experience here.  I do wish they'd open a location on the west side of town as it's about a 30+ minute drive to all three locations. Takeout with that kind of commute doesn't work because my favorite dish doesn't reheat well. It needs to be eaten fresh."}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout and this is my new fav Asian spot. Cinnamon shrimp was uniquely flavored and delicious. Lettuce wraps were awesome. And chicken with fried rice hit the spot. Can't wait to return and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Love the food here, happy choices were very good and they will make it as spicy or mild as you ask for. The service was very nice and attentive and the price was right and included a glass of wine, which was very good.. I will come back."}
{"text":"When my sweetheart's mother suggested an Asian restaurant called Flo's, he just about hung up on her.  Luckily for us, she stuck to her guns.  We absolutely loved Flo's!  In fact, we went there twice in December!  We tried several dishes, but our favorites so far have been the fried calamari (which has delicious peppers mixed in), the lettuce cups (which have a great kick to them), the egg fried rice with chicken (I rarely like fried rice at restaurant's - this was fabulous) and the pho was pretty good, too!  The pad Thai was really good at a level 5 once I added a ton more red chili paste. I just like it better elsewhere.   They have an amazing happy hour from 3 to 7 daily, which gets you 50% off appetizers and drinks!  I love a good deal. This one will have me coming back time and again.   It is really a cute restaurant, too!  Now you know what to get me as a gift... A Flo's giftcard!"}
{"text":"Found this place courtesy of the yelp folks- thank you.  Started with lettuce wraps. I think the portion was easily sized for two - but I destroyed the platter. Really tasty and very hot! (Temp not spicy)The sauces were very good. There was a hot sauce with a texture of salsa but the taste of Thai hot sauces. Excellent sauces.  Then I thought I would try the tom yum soup. The bowl was large enough for 3 and filled to the brim.  The fresh mushrooms were very good, the shrimp a bit boiled.   Would have liked to try an entree but too full. Ordered chicken fried rice - to go!! Great, attentive service. The server was a bit snooty with an air of wanting to be elsewhere. But the rest of the staff was excellent.  Putting it on my places to try again"}
{"text":"This is not good Asian food.  The veggie stir fry was terrible.  The rice was deplorable.  The hot and sour soup was very good - a bright spot on the menu.  If I was ever forced to come here again, I would order that.  Otherwise, this is genericized Asia food that is no better than the take out you could get at any mall in any state in the U.S.  And, the service was slow.  Not terrible.  Just kind of absent."}
{"text":"People really love this place.  Stylish?  Yes.  Good prices?  Sort of, more expensive than I thought it would be.  It is good, but I wasn't blown away.  I thought it was rather average.  Maybe I just don't like Chinese food that much.  I actually think I prefer PF Changs."}
{"text":"Flo's was highly recommended to me by a friend and it fell so, so flat. All of the wait staff seem to be in high school, and ours was no exception. They all had empty-hearted \"how are you?\" and didn't look at us when speaking. It was really uncomfortable.  It would have been fine if not for the food.  We ordered the crispy spring rolls, some pork dumplings, Spicy Thai coconut soup (Tom Kha Gai), and some beef fried rice.  The spring rolls were ok, however they were egg rolls. Why would you advertise as spring rolls?  The pork dumplings were just a ball of pork sausage and the dumpling casings were all falling off. I could only eat one.  The soup was really sweet, and not spicy at all. For spice level, it was 0/10. I even had my boyfriend test it, who hates spicy food, and he couldn't taste any either. I've had this soup many places before, and it didn't even match the description that Flo's listed. It was extremely disappointing.  The beef fried rice was really mushy and salty. I was hoping that they couldn't mess that up. I was wrong.  Our waiter did not check on us for a long time, and politely expressed that I was not satisfied with the soup and to take it away. My boyfriend was really hungry, so he kept the rice and asked for a box so we could leave. The waiter argued with me about the soup before taking it away.  Meanwhile, Flo was going around the restaurant talking to customers during our entire meal. She passed our table more than once. I was surprised she was not notified that we were unsatisfied.  When we left, we were not greeted. I have no fond memories of this place and all never return. The only reason I am leaving a two star review is because it was a clean place, and the food, while edible, was falsely advertised and honestly gross."}
