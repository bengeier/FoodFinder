{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. This place is a total rip-off! They WAY overcharge for the quality and size of the food. My husband's omelette was only about 2 eggs at the most and came with ham and cheese. Nothing else but one measly slice of orange. For $7.50, it should at least come with hash browns or potatoes or toast. My breakfast sandwich was nothing special either. Dry croissant and zero seasoning on the eggs. And they serve on plastic plates- really classy and great for the environment (insert sarcastic voice here). Also, this place is located inside a hair salon so unless you eat outside, expect to eat with strong hair product scents wafting up your noise as you take the 5 bites that it requires to finish their tiny portions. Will NOT be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came in before my salon appointment. So glad I did ! I had the ham panini- very fresh and hot !  I can not wait to come back ! The sold out ribs looked amazing !"}
{"text":"I'd like to think Gloria's Cafe is my own little secret, but I can assure you it is not. Tucked inside Steven Paul's Salon and just over to the left is \"cuisine ala Heaven\"... whatever suits your pallette,  you will find it here: espresso, tea, brunch, lunch, amazing salads and so much more. Today I had a Bacon, Egg & Cheese Croissant.  My friend had A Bacon Wrap. Both light, both delicious, both only $7. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual breakfast out of the way of the Old Town brunch scene. This place was it!  Locally owned bistro style with food made to order and friendly staff.  We ordered the breakfast sandwich, fruit cup and bagel with cream cheese. All delicious!"}
{"text":"Very yummy & fresh breakfast wrap!  Supporting locally owned breakfast & lunch Cafe!!"}
{"text":"Tommy and the boys are the best!  Whatever your mood, he has it and you will be happy!  The chicken salad is to die for. Panini's are always a hit and if you're in the mood for breakfast...served all day! Salads, wings and more!  Delish  Not only is the food good, Tommy always has a smile and is happy to serve.   follow that with getting \"A's\" every inspection that hits (tommy is meticulous) clean as a whistles whether you just want a latte or some grub.. we all at Steven Paul highly recommend!!"}
