{"text":"Great food with the right amount of serving and cheap drinks!"}
{"text":"Went to the Green Room for the first time.  Had popped in before, but it was always so rammed that we couldn't get a table.  This time, however, we were in luck.  Got to sit on the patio, which has a garage sale vibe, but in a good way.  The pond and trees are a nice addition to the patio.
The food was cheap, simple, and delicious.  Stars off for slowish service and dirty tables."}
{"text":"For those who want to know what the place is like before heading there:
- Think of it as a dive bar (where they have random, non-matching furnitures)
- Cheap food ($6-9) that includes pad thai, amazing sandwiches, large salads
- Good for cheap, casual weeknight get-togethers with friends
- Don't go there for the service. Usually quite slow.

I personally like this place when I feel like something very casual, and drinking and eating very cheaply - and eating non-typical bar food (kinda get sick of nachos, calamari, and fries you get at regular bars)."}
{"text":"This place made me soooooooooooooooooo happy when I was living in Toronto and I went there for beer, food, nights out, afternoons of chilling with a newspaper and chose it as the venue for my leaving do. A bit of a quirky place and...... I just want to be there right now!!"}
{"text":"If you want to drink for cheap it's ideal, cool atmosphere, and cheap drinks. Great place to start or end your night! 

Eat elsewhere though, for the same price you can get something way better pretty much anywhere else. You'll get cold oven fries, wonderbread sandwiches, and the nachos they serve are laughable. The drunk meal you make when you get home will likely be of better quality. 
If you do choose to eat here be sure to absorb the food in plenty of alcohol, and make sure they bring you the correct order!"}
{"text":"Great for some grimy atmosphere and cheap drinks... notice all of the asian people cooking in the kitchen? Order the asian food on the menu dummies!"}
{"text":"Edit, updated:

The food is no longer fresh and delicious, we ordered many things and were disappointed in all of them. I'd expect that they would clean up their act after being busted a few times by the hygiene police, but they actually went way downhill.
Service and ambience is still good, but food went from 5 to 2 stars.

Old review:
I love this place. I've been here a few times and loved it at all times. Last night was super busy and our food arrived late and scattered but who cares : beautiful patio, beautiful vibe, a great selection of beers, the cheapest and most delicious food ever, and a great server who did his best at handling like a thousand customers. One of the best places for a heart to heart with a friend, or like 10 friends, or even a second (or third) date after a nice walk in the park."}
{"text":"The Green Room is no hipster joint at all.
They have cheap beer and cheap pad thai. This is where I used to go for endless coffees and cigarettes in high school. You used ot be able to buy singles from the bar and they rarely carded.

It's sort of a grandma's living room meets college dorm, meets quirky coffee house.

Great for students and anyonevon a budget"}
{"text":"I was at the Green Room last night for the first time in AGES. I was happy to see that it was exactly as I remembered it - ya know, business as usual.

It's a great place to just hang out with friends and have a few beers and what not, but when it comes to the food, I'm a bit leery. (Sticky floors and tables, makes me question cleanliness all around.)  But, that being said, I got pretty hungry and wanted their Avocado & Brie sandwich, which I remember being pretty good, but alas, the kitchen was already closed. Bummer."}
{"text":"Ok, where the hell do I begin. This place seems fine if you're going with a small group but man oh man PLEASE BEWARE if you're in a larger group. They will target you and attempt to overcharge you for your bill. And ,if you do not pay, the staff will thug it up and assault you on your way out as they did with my group when we tried explaining that we had all paid our portions. I found Toronto to be a friendly city until I came to this establishment. Thank you for the lousy food and even worse customer service."}
{"text":"Definitely a dive bar atmosphere, but a cool student atmosphere. 19+ to enter. The patio and upper floor are definitely the highlights as well as the food. They sell korean/thai food that is delicious and very good quality. All prices are cheap. All the waiters were friendly and fast! Definitely a grungy mismatched decor."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Green Room for drinks on a Thursday night to catch up with each other.  We used to frequent Green Room a few years ago and decided to reminisce.  The place was about half full the entire night, not busy at all.  We started out on the patio and ordered a round of drinks with wings and nachos.  The service was non-existent.  The drinks took way too long to arrive and when the wings were delivered they were room temperature.  Ok we thought, maybe we'll get more attentive service inside.  Boy were we wrong, because it was even worse inside!  We notified staff that we had switched tables yet nobody ever came around to take second drink orders.  We had to wave someone down for service after sitting 20 minutes with empty glasses.  The prices for drinks are cheap but that's because you're paying to drink the mix, there is not a hint of alcohol in the drink.  When we got the bill at the end of the night to make matters worse we were charged automatic gratuity 15% on a table of 4.  I guess that's why the service is a joke because no matter what the service provided, the servers are going to make a reasonable tip.  I don't mind tipping but I do mind being forced to tip when there was absolutely no service.  Last night was a joke.  I would give Green Room 0 stars if I could and you can bet I will not be going there again.  A little tip, go next door to The Lab where the drinks are cheap but strong, and the staff treat you with respect."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Came here for the first time with group of ten friday night. Nachos were disgusting. Later into the night, one of my friends had too much to drink and threw up on the floor. One of the servers started yelling at us and didn't even check to see if my friend was alright. He yelled at us to clean it up and threw out our bags that were under the table without our consent."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the coolest and hip bars in Toronto! The coolness factor begins with the fact that its location is somewhat hidden, since you have to access it from an alleyway.  The atmosphere is phenomenal-very eerie and yet incredibly cozy. You feel as though you are in a secret location where only the hippest people have been invited. The place is lit up by candles in beer bottle \"candle holders\" and Christmas lights, the tables are wooden and carved, there are unique curtains on the windows. I think the atmosphere is what makes this place!

As for food and drinks: these are pretty ordinary, with normal prices. Usually order pitchers, Bailey's or shots. They also have mixed drinks, but I don't think this is their specialty (do yourself a favour and pass on the Caesar-we made someone drink it on a dare, let's keep it at that!). 

A couple of negatives (aside from the Caesar): the place is crazy busy so you might have to wait to get a seat (but it is worth it, I promise!), and the owner is sometimes there on Saturday nights!! It's very annoying having a random elderly lady walking around peering at your table.

Go to the Green Room if you want to spend a chill, relaxing night with great friends in the best atmosphere in town :)"}
{"text":"My friends who grew up or went to school in Toronto have what I consider an irrational fondness for what I can only describe as the dive-iest bar in the Annex.  When I get invited to a gathering there I often spend a lot of energy trying to suggest an alternative, but what can you do when people love a place and have been going there since high school?

Yes, the food is cheap and on a busy night it is stuffed to the gills with cute, young people.  But the place is a mess - I can't even imagine what those couches look like in daylight - the food is awful (admittedly, I will share an avocado and brie sandwich under duress), the music is deafening and the service stinks.  And that's not getting into the less pleasant rumors about the place.

For some reason the staff at the Green Room have been given the orders to maximize money per table, with no regard to service whatsoever, and the result is really some of the worst service experiences I have had in the city.  On one memorable night, while waiting for a few more friends, my three friends and I were asked to move from a table for four to a table for two.  When we asked if we could eat our nearly-finished meals, we were unceremoniously told no and then our waiter bused our food and drinks without asking first. On top of all of this it wasn't even that busy in the downstairs area where we were sitting.

Some people disparage the bar by calling it a \"hipster\" watering hole, but the people who attend aren't exactly scenesters, more likely people who got tired of going to Future Bakery/Labyrinth around the corner.  The patio is nice although it is really just an extension of a back alley behind the building in front of the bar. In the colder months you can't move an inch without knocking over people's coats, scarves or mitts, and navigating the upstairs dining room is akin to taking on a maze of peoples' limbs and tables too-close together. 

I guess I had the misfortune of moving to Toronto in my post-dive bar phase of life, otherwise maybe I would have a soft spot in my heart for the Green Room, too."}
{"text":"I used to love Green Room for its variety of food choices and the cheap price. However, after a few times of going there with a bigger group of friends and getting over-cahrged for food that didn't arrive, I started to feel like maybe it needs a bit more supervision on getting food to customers and not over charge tipsy people who would never blink twice and pay for what they didn't get."}
{"text":"So first - you don't go to the Green Room for the food, and you don't go to the Green Room for the service.  You go to the Green Room because it's the Green Room. 

I was there last week and the waiter swore at us on at least two different occasions. Once he brought us a drink which we didn't order and when we pointed this out he said \"Well you have to speak fucking louder ok, because it's noisy in here.\"  On another, my friend asked what kinds of beer they had and he said \"I'm not going to list every fucking beer we have because there are too many, just tell me what you want.\"  He wasn't saying it in a cutesy way either, he was just a douchenozzle.   Perhaps this is due to the fact that if you have a group of three or more there is a 15% gratuity automatically added to the bill, so the waiter could call your mother a dirty whore and he'd still get his tip.  Fortunately our mother's reputations survived unmaligned. 

Normally this level of douchery would upset me, but hey this is the Green Room. You go to the Green Room because it has personality. It has character.   Sure, it might be the personality and character of that creepy uncle who your parents would never leave you alone with because god only knows what he would do to you, but hey if you want a sanitized experience go to Jack Astor's. 

One big change I've noticed is that the washrooms, which years ago were like something  you'd find in a Soviet gulag, have been transformed into a veritable Taj Mahal of bathrooms. They done put some fancy ass tile work up in that mofo. 

Pros: It's the Green Room, drinks are cheap, washroom is no longer  place where nightmares are born.
Cons: It's loud, the food is bad, waiters have learned customer service by watching reruns of \"Hells Kitchen\"
Verdict: It's the Green Room."}
{"text":"I admit The Green Room isn't for anyone but I like it. The food is cheap and generally decent. Alcohol is affordable. Questionable and filthy interior. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I was invited to a party with these international exchange students and it was a great night. The music is decent and there are 2 spacious floors. The environment is quite dark and intimate and the music isn't overly loud to the point where you have to shout.

There is no bar service so one of the downfalls is that you need to wait till someone comes to your table.

BTW, don't order nachos - they suck. My homemade ones are much better. Just go for drinks.

So if you don't mind walking through a back alley - it isn't that sketchy, really - it's a great place to wind down."}
{"text":"Great price, slow service, large space, nice lights. 

Inconsistent experiences: music can be loud or not, service can be slow by rarely snobbish. Bathrooms have been rebuilt which is nice.

You can't really complain when you get a fish and chips for $7 or a pint for $4."}
{"text":"If you told me a year ago that the Green Room would once again be one of my main hangouts, I would have said you were crazy. But new ownership (while keeping the bar exactly the same) means you can sit on the couches without fear of what bugs you're getting.

Absurdly cheap beer is basically the reason I go there - and because, when we feel like getting drunk and a little loud, no one cares. The food is not great, but it is super cheap and there's a lot of choice. They usually have fairly good beer on tap for way cheaper prices than anywhere else.

Pleasant ambiance, though the second floor is WAY too dark. Lovely patio."}
{"text":"Worst experience here ever! Never going back! RUDE waiter. Waited over 30min for our food. Got my food after all my friends finished their meal and after I had to hunt down our waiter to find out where my dinner was. One of my friends never got her dinner! At all!! They never compensated for this at all. Do not go here. Uts not worth it."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have been this place if my friends didn't bring me. The alleyway is not a welcoming place to be, but...

This place is a great place for students. It's laid back and the interior of the place gives a vintage-type of feel. It's definitely a nice touch that they use candle lights around the place after a certain time. Just like most bars, the place is most likely packed during the weekends and is VERY dead during the weeknights. Very cheap drinks - like VERY CHEAP compared to the other bars around The Annex. 

But, the cheap drinks sounds exactly what you are getting. I have read in several occasions on BlogTO that the greenroom have been closed due to sanitary issues. Even today, I wonder how they are still open. They leave the fruits for the sangria open all day on the counter - tons of bugs, especially fruit flies, have made themselves home on top of the fruits that is about to go into your pitcher. Everything is pretty much left out in the open. I never tried their food, but I rather opt out of that in case I get sick from their dirty food handling.

A place where I do find myself heading back to since my friends really enjoy hanging out in this atmosphere in large groups. But, I would never opt to come to this place myself or bring anyone here."}
{"text":"People actually review the Green Room? Haha, why? Does anyone consider online reviews when deciding on whether or not to go to the Green Room? That would just be... Weird. 
It is what it is, and will always be so. Take it or leave it. But definitely go at night--you don't want to see it during the day. And have a few."}
{"text":"The Green Room is perhaps one of Toronto's best kept secrets. I've been going here for many years, and felt it was time to write a review for them.

I've always found the service extremely friendly and pleasant, and usually also quite quick.

The menu is a mixture of Vietnamese/Asian/Pub food, in one of the best ways... You can come for a bacon and egg breakfast, Pad Thai, Sandwiches and fries, or even some mexican food...

Perhaps my favourite dish, and not to be missed is the Green Room Special - a plate of glass noodles, with Shrimp, Chicken, Tofu, Egg and Stir Fried Vegetables. This has long been my favourite dinner spot out, and it will continue to be.

Not to mention, the drinks are very cheap! Half litre of house wine is only $12, and many mixed drinks start at $5.

I would highly recommend this place, if you can find it..."}
{"text":"Ahhh, The Green Room. It's just this special, special place. If you've spent any time as a student in Toronto, you know why. These days, don't expect it to be open, there's about a 20% chance that they're closed for a health violation or because they've been serving without a license (but they're oddly strict about underaged drinking (even when they don't have a license to serve)).

I will always love The Green Room, and everyone has some ridiculous story about it. Pass on the food. If you really have to sop up some sloppy drinks, get the pad thai I guess."}
{"text":"This place feels like a bar but has an extensive menu of bar foods and Thai inspired foods. Our experience wasn't the greatest- the first mistake was coming here for food primarily. My friends and I ordered the veggie rolls, mini pizzas, wings and quesadillas. All of these are simple foods that most of us could make and came out pretty simple. The wings were fried and dry but didn't have sauce on them. The sauce was on the side but wasn't BBQ sauce. It was sweet ketchup. When we asked for sauces we were given more sweet ketchup and salad dressing. My friend who ordered the wings wasn't happy and when we asked to send them back the waitress send the kitchen/ senior manager  wouldn't allow this. It only seemed like 2 people were working and this place can only a quarter or half the capacity of the restaurant. We're college kids from the U.S. and our dorm room kitchens have seen better food. The drinks weren't too bad though. So overall, service was not great, food was not great, drinks were decent, atmosphere was decent."}
{"text":"Johara/Joey brought me here, she was my only friend from OCAD who didn't have any classless OCAD tendencies like, being inconsiderate or...being stupid. 

The Green Room is perhaps the only place opposite from the establishments of Yorkville that I completely enjoyed.  The humble bar has all the characteristics of a shabby bohemian hole in the ground, and its décor rivals even the most gypsy of grandmothers.  But it so SO relaxed that none of these things matter.
I was very touched that Johara knew that I would like this place despite how different The Green Room was from what I regularly enjoy.  Not many people are able to accurately predict the things I approve of.  

She especially booked the Victorian couch at the slightly elevated section of the bar, giving me the illusion of superiority that I desperately seek in life.  The company we had were completely agreeable despite them being....liberals.  It felt like Nirvana, and I ordered the alcohol like I was the God of wine.  And we got drunk.

The service here was phenomenal, relaxed, and perfect for the establishment, the prices for drinks were very reasonable, it's a shame that this place wasn't bigger.  

Perhaps the only bohemian joint in Toronto I would ever find myself coming to willingly.  So nice that I can almost smoke a big spliff......not that I would ever do such a thing!"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Great food for cheap and cheap drrinks. My favourite is the $14 pitcher of sangria... the best of the best. Waiters here are very nice! They do tend to get very busy on the weekends but it's the ideal place to be. 

Totally worth it..... I'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good night with a budget. New place to be!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go after class to grab drinks with friends. Has such a cozy vibe to it! Plus drinks are cheap."}
{"text":"C'est le genre de bar caché au fond d'une allée à 2 pas de Bloor Street West. L'entrée est vraiement glauque cachée à côté des poubelles! Mais une fois rentrée l'ambiance est très symapthique. 
Ambiance bar pub avec canapés pour les groupes et petites tables pour les couples. Tout ce petit monde s'accorde gentiment et les 3 serveuses courent dans tous les sens. Le service est très rapide et que vous le croyez ou non on paie avant de partir seulement, la confiance m'étonnera toujours au Canada!
Service de restauration classique de bar :  cesar salad, burgers et sandwichs, arrosez le tout avec soft ou bières.

Une bonne adresse pour les groupes."}
{"text":"A 5 for a Dive...

This was a great start our night.  This place is tucked away in a back alley behind a random plaza strip.  The atmosphere and music are totally worth the 15 second walk through a sketch back alley.  This bar is classified as a dive bar but gives off more of a trendy lounge feel.  Also, there's a sexy upstairs part to this drive bar/lounge so it doesn't get too crowded.


Pro's

Fun relaxing atmosphere, very trendy and funky with couches, different colour lighting (green, blue) and nice use of levels.  Music is a perfect volume; not too load so you can still hang out across a table a have a conversation, and not to quite so you can still sit back and people watch to a sweet beat. Service was styled like any pub, friendly and to your seat, but still leaving the option open to grab a drink from the bar at anytime.

Con's
Sketchy back alley way entrance. Drink prices are around $5-6 per drink.  Couches are reserved for groups of 5 or more (I really wanted  a couch seat).


Recommendation;
Don't ask the bartender to make you and your girl a surprise shot like a Banana Jack.  The guy ended up mixing whiskey and Frangelico together ... all I can say is it was surprising... Surprisingly Gross!


This bar was a little tough to gauge but I still enjoyed it for a dive bar.

A 5 for a Dive."}
{"text":"Oh man. I know Rachel L. said the Green Room is no mas but indulge me. 

It was a windy, snowy Toronto Thursday night and I was fighting my way through the streets with a few friends in the Annex. We sort of had a vague idea where we were going but due to the aforementioned wind hadn't looked up for awhile. Turn a corner, and bang we're at the Green Room. Perfect.

Super cozy and warm inside. Candles galore. Beers on tap that I'm into. A din of conversation and a really sweet two floor layout. Sort of felt like I was in an old friend's living room but bigger.

Clearly romanticizing, but seriously going to miss this place."}
{"text":"Am I seriously the first to review The Green Room? This Yelp Canada thing is insane.

Even though everyone knows the place, The Green Room's back alley entrance makes it feel like a secret club. 

The ambiance inside is strictly casual, in a 'slump on the couch in a dim basement' kind of way. The upstairs layout is more like a standard pub. If the crowds and weather co-operate, you may be able to find a spot on the enclosed patio.

There's beer in bottle and pitcher form, plus cocktails and liquor although the drink menu doesn't provide much guidance. Hungry kids can order up decent Asian entrees, sandwiches and snacks. The prices are kind to student budgets.

The Green Room isn't really about specific drinks or dishes, though. It's about the atmosphere.  This is The Annex condensed: eclectic music, ramshackle but cheerful decor, staff and patrons that defy categorization.

I was first introduced to The Green Room in Frosh Week and something crazy happens to me every time I'm here. Examples: running into a former flame I'm still pining over, being yelled at by the manager for making out in the corner, being sent martinis compliments of a mysterious stranger, being carded while the under-agers in my party are not, being dragged home by near-strangers (this one happened multiple times). What I'm trying to say is that 'things happen' at The Green Room."}
{"text":"Some of the cheapest food in the city - but they don't sacrifice on quality and taste! I've been here a couple times - and the seating and overall atmosphere isn't my favorite (it's old... and kinda just put together without any effort - but maybe that adds to the vibe?). The menu however - wow! Everything here is so cheap and you would think the food wouldn't taste good because of the price - but that's not the case. I enjoyed it.

Parking is a pain because they don't have a dedicated lot, so you either park on the street or park behind at a Green P - either way its most likely paid parking when you go. That's the only drawback here - save on food prices, but pay for parking!"}
{"text":"Cheap drinks were cool but when they said they would let our group of 20+ request a song they ultimately didn't let us love the coco.

Well they did but with the polite sudden hush of a British parlour room from the Victorian era. I almost forgot dive bars were polite environments where you are supposed to sip pabst blue ribbon with your pinky out. 

Also it's a sitting policy, which is exactly what we want in order to get the full grade school experience. The only time I should be told to sit down when I'm drinking is when I'm piss drunk and missing the toilet, not when I'm trying to order my first pitcher of beer. So in response I put my hand up to order drinks, but as I should have learned from school that often times you just don't get picked. 

The friendliest staff member was the bouncer which is ironic. He gets 5 stars. They should really make a yelp page just for him to help their cause. 

Also when I arrived there was a group of Asian foreign students singing songs. Weak.

Also the room was not green.

So boys and girls come here if you want to witness unaddressed irony unfold where witnessing nothing happen is the pinnacle of green(?) room's excitement."}
{"text":"LOL my co-worker found a floating dead cockroach in her beer. Muchos Nachos were good. Ordered 2 of those except the second plate had very little cheese compared to the first. Took forever to flag down waiter for food."}
{"text":"I used to travel a lot to Canada for work. Toronto, save a few corners near Bloor, is my least favorite place in Canada. It's like the Chicago of Canada. The first night of the first time I visited Toronto, I ended up at the Green Room for drinks. The Green Room is responsible for me returning to Toronto. I say responsible, because there's apparently a no drinking and snogging rule in the Green Room -- the ramifications being all but forced out into the shockingly cold snow after three rounds of tequila. Or was it five? And for that chilling service, five stars and a god bless.

Let me back up. I went to college in Hanover, New Hampshire. Our mascot was absurdly named, \"The Big Green.\" Green what? Green nothing. Just big and green. The school is famous for its fraternities. (Animal House was about our school.) Having lived most of my freshman year in the basements of Alpha Theta and Phi Tau, full of sturm und drang and free rum cokes, I'll tell you, the Green Room is the epitome of frat house party in all but actuality.

Wine, women, and a jukebox, if my memory has not failed me. Odd, unmatched couches, tables, and chairs are scattered about without rhyme or reason -- or taste. A song plays by the fireplaces and the pool tables above and below. The place is packed to the gills with bright-eyed, bushy-tailed college kids wet behind the ears. The urge to huddle away from home must be an innate defense mechanism in cold climes. They're draped along the walls or sprawled around the room like patients etherised upon a table, while alcohol fairies flit from patron to patron at a drunkard's pace.

My recommendation: come with company on an absolutely frozen night. Toss a coin and a prayer to the Parking Gods and find respite for your cold seats in a warm, plush couch in the darkest corner of the Green Room. Flag down a waitress and order shots of liquor, and lots of it. I assure you, the rest will be written in history."}
{"text":"Well I can only reiterate what other Yelpers have already written. It's a great place. Not full of hipsters. Kinda dirty but it adds to the pub atmosphere. Not a great drink selection. Food is sub-par. Nice and cheap. Interesting atmosphere, definitely has that secret clubhouse feel to it. Love the lighting.

Be forewarned: there is in fact a creep old oriental woman who stalks around there AND there is no water pressure in the washrooms (bring Purel)."}
{"text":"I always come here with a big group of friends and we always have a good time. Cheap food and beer :)"}

I recommend if you're in the area looking for a chill place to drink and catch up with some friends."}
{"text":"The Green room is a dive bar period and I have been going there for at least 11 years and I had a lot of fun back in the day. The beer is cheap, specially the pitchers however in all the times I visited this place, I never, ever dared to order any food. I mean, if you have been in the Green Room, then you know how the kitchen looks. Like a depressing, green-filtered kitchen you see in gritty movies like Fight Club.

Sure I like the Bohemian decor, the couches, the bookcases on the walls and the candlelit atmosphere on the second floor but during the day this place looks just like what it is, a dump. Bring a date who is not a student or covered in tattoos here during the day and you will never heard from her again.

Normally, I would have given this place two stars, heck maybe, in a flight of fancy even three. However, as many of you may know, this place got shut down for the extreme health code violations it managed to garner in just 2 years. Seriously it seemed as they were trying to collect violations as they were some sort of rare and precious Unobtanium! They passion for them seemed quite unmatched.

And if in one of your DineSafe Toronto reports, as recent as Feb./15/2011 includes among others, the nugget of:
\"INADEQUATE PEST CONTROL\" 
You know for a fact, I won't be coming back. Although I am fair, so maybe if they stay clean (green) for a year or two, then maybe I will come back. We'll see. 

I mean, what do people need to see in order to avoid this place? Cockroaches using your pitcher of Moosehead as a soothing Jacuzzi?"}
{"text":"Student heaven with cheap food and drinks.  I'd just opt for the latter as there is a reason why the food is so cheap.  Food is better at the red room, and that's not saying much.
It's a great place for a large group to come and drink and laugh the night away, start the night, or finish the night.
Really, just an easy place to hang out and a very nice (oddly large) place with an unassuming back alley entrance.  

The alley way smells of gross grease as does the entrance, which further derters one from ordeirng food, but if u were to order food just heed warning that even their pub food is no good (which is usually the type that is fairly safe).

go if your young, poor, and in the neighbourhood."}

{"text":"I've only been to the Green Room once, but based on first impressions only, I'd say I had a good time and enjoyed the bar quite a bit... First, the story:
 
 In the dead of winter, on a very dark and cold night I was searching for a place to meet some friends...Lighting was sparse, directions were non existent and all I knew was that where I was going was in the back of the buildings of Bathurst and Bloor....Vague; slightly, but I was keen to the adventure...

 After a few minutes of displacement, I finally found the sign for Green Room. (For those who have never been before, enter off the alley from Brunswick Avenue and keep your eyes peeled!) 

 It's nice to see that some gems are still hidden and worth searching for. Green Room is a large, yet cozy pub with two floors of dimly lit ambiance and a decent, eclectic mix of music.

 I did notice that the crowd was fairly young (yet as I write this I realize how utterly relative that statement is...).  By young, I mean university students there for group drinking sessions and cheap food. Word to the wise; the food was sub par, at best. I ordered nachos and I'm pretty sure my amateur chip and salsa mix would've fared just as well. 

 I liked Green Room in that the drinks were cheap and plentiful and I was able to order an entire pitcher of sangria for $5! The atmosphere there is very casual, come-as-you-are, and cozy; like drinking in your own dingy basement!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?

Customer service was nonexistent. Even with only 2 tables being used in the place on a Sunday night, the server would not make eye contact with us or come by to see if we needed anything, not once. We had to walk up to the counter where she was eyes glued to phone unmoving for upwards of 10 minutes. Overall, she just didn't seem competent.

The decor of the place is atmospheric like the previous Green Room, maybe dingy, but more lived-in than anything. It's a comfort place.

The new menu is well designed and attractive. It was easy to find what I was looking for (Muchos Nachos) and how much for a side like guacamole is directly listed. Very easy.

The food was bland and the toppings were weirdly clumped in one spot. Nothing special, poor display, but whatever. We were hungry.

On finishing and going to pay, I was trying to hand her $10 and a tip (felt bad, I guess), but she was trying to dash away from me back to the counter and nearly had trouble taking the money. It was like she just wanted to get away and back to what was happening online.

Overall, poor service and attention, plain and bland nachos, didn't try any drinks. Didn't seem to have any Hot drinks either; maybe that's because the place is new but she didn't seem to know how to make a cup of tea and coffee was out of the question. When we asked about the hot apple cider on the menu, that was also foreign to her so we gave up asking.

Won't be coming back, at least not for another 4-5 months while they get their shit in gear.

Still, Great for large groups.
Cheap.
Comfy. 
Which is why we come.

Oh, remembered one more thing. She asked if we'd like to split the bill, for one item. I wonder how that would have worked if I had said yes..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for students! Tons of seating space for large groups. Nice and casual atmosphere, dim lighting and crazy mismatched decor. There's a nice patio full of christmas lights.
 Drinks and food are very affordable. I ordered the avocado salad, and fresh veggie rolls. The fresh veggie rolls here do it better than a lot of asian restaurants. Here, they don't skimp out on the veggies. They also have a variety of choices for asian food, and typical pub friendly food, and vegan, vegetarian options as well which is hard to find in this area. I also had a white sangria which was pretty good.
Service is quick, staff are friendly and laid back. 
Note that there is no air conditioning, so if it's a hot, humid and muggy day, keep that in mind when drinking."}
{"text":"The dark graffiti-ed alley way entrance, the lack of heat, prices from 2006, and grungy decorations like your uncle's basement, the green room is quick to remind me that my student days have long pasted.

If you feel like a nostalgic college night, or feeling stingy, this is the place to be! Staffs are friendly, and you can get a full meal for under $6. Put on something comfy and come hang out, no one's judging. It's a happy reminder that things were much simpler."}
{"text":"This place is a total dive, cheap and can be a lot of fun. 

You certainly do not go to this place if you are aiming to impress someone. But if you want a bar with ok food for not a lot of money, this is the place you are looking for.

Where else can you get a burger and fries in TO for less than 8 bucks. 

(Disclaimer: I have yet to try the burger)

Revision: Now having tried the lentil soup I can say that it is quite tasty and a bargain at $3.75."}
{"text":"To be honest I was a bit skeptical coming here. After reading mixed reviews and asking some regulars,  I expected a young-ish crowd, crap food, cheap drinks, and stuffy stinky atmosphere (a la Madison). 

I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in thru the unmarked door and entered this small library hideaway. 
It is true tho, the food is crap, but the drinks decently priced ($4.75 - 5.75 for a pint, 15.00 for a pitcher)
Stay away from the sangria, because it's just some juice, water and wine. there wasn't even fruit in it! But gave me enough for an asian glow. 

We did make a reservation and had to get there by 8. I think it was smart we did that cuz we got a small corner to ourselves. 

The place was cozy, but still felt spacious, and was noisy, but not noisy enough to drown out the people at our table talking. And they had some good tune in the background. 

My only real complaint was the staff there. They all seemed stoned out of their mind, or incredibly not friendly. The one serving our table, spoke to us in a gruff voice, and really needed to buy some new clothes that fit her.  And the bill was difficult to understand, as it was just some numbers scrawled on a piece of paper. 
Minus 1 for that, really. 

I'd come back. Yes, it's a young crowd, but I barely noticed and I don't have to mingle with them. Too bad they don't serve desserts. 
I'd recommend it for people with large groups that just want a place to chill and catch up. There's not much else in the area.

oh and good call on wearing scantily clad attire for upstairs (previous reviewer), it did get very warm!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome both times I've went. Sat upstairs and also downstairs. Cheap drinks. Don't come expecting more than what you pay for though but cheap awesomeness to say the least."}
{"text":"Green Room seems to be a place that is popular with students and I can see why. The atmosphere here is very nice, the food is cheap and delicious and the alcohol is reasonably priced.

Green Room is of the same family as The Red Room and Nirvana so if you've been there you have some idea what to expect. Mismatched tables, interesting art scattered on the walls and dim yet pleasant lighting. Unless it gets too crowded Green Room is a very comfortable place to eat and drink.

The food is probably the best part of this place. For a very low price (most dishes are below $5!) you can get a very good meal. My personal favorite is the spicy, pho-esque \"Viet Soup\". The only food item I've found lacking is the nacho plate, which is passable but bland. The beer at Green Room is not the lowest price I've found, but it's not bad either.

My main problem with Green Room is the very slow service. Considering how popular the place is, you'd think they'd hire a couple more people, but often I've found it taking a very long time to order or even to pay.

Despite this though Green Room is still a fun place to go, especially if you want a good meal to go along with your drinks."}
{"text":"Went to the Green Room the other day - and their prices have gone down! Pitchers of beer are now $13! However, service quality is mixed. We had this one server who got ALL of our orders wrong. Not once, but twice. 

I ordered a burger with cheese and my friend ordered quesadilla's without sour cream. What did we get - a burger without cheese and quesadilla's with sour cream lathered on top of the quesadilla and on the side. When we mentioned this to the server - she played ignorant and said that she wrote it on the order. But, after our meal - we were still a wee bit hungry - so we then ordered the cheesy natcho's with chicken. They came without chicken. This time the server said she did not hear our request for the chicken. Oh, my. 

So, thankfully there was another server who quickly took her place after that debacle and brought my friend (who was drinking rum and coke) a drink with not one ounce - but 3 ounces of rum in one glass to help make up for all the food order mistakes. If it wasn't for him, I would have had to brought the rating down to two stars."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone is complaining about the hipsters?  I love the hipsters, at least they dress nice and know good music.  SO yeah, the Green Room is pretty much the U of T and Ryerson hipster student joints, or more becoming a hipster wannabe joint.  The entrance is tucked away in the alley next to the garbage bins for a local bar.  Sketchy but you know, its suppose to be \"cool\".  The food here is cheap and good for hang over.  You've got your typical nacho chips (HUGE PLATTER!), chicken wings, fries, beer, cocktails, and tons of people.  People definitely go there to check each other out every once in a while.  Once I went with my brother and he claimed that an older gay man sitting next to us wouldn't take his eyes off of me.  It would've been better if he was hot.
BTW, the drinks are cheap, and that's important in Toronto.  $2.50 beer and $5 vodka gimlet doesn't come by easy in this expensive over priced town.
PS: go upstairs, that's where the action is.
PSS: For you Americans, happy hour is illegal in Canada.  Which sucks, but that's why DUI is not a major problem."}
{"text":"Are you a fan of Pixar's Ratatouille? Do you dream of having rats handle your food? Then the green room is for you! I'd stay away from the food, but it does serve as an ok Annex destination. Some would call it the beige of dive bars. 

Pro tip: Go get sushi, then come get blotto. 

** stars"}
{"text":"I used to love the Green Room.  It was a chill place to get together.  Good for drinks, but also decent food.  The rundown couches and mismatched chairs just added character.  Then one time I went there when it was still light outside - and what a mistake.  You don't want to see the place when it's light - we got to see mice racing each other under the couches and around the tables.  And then another time they delivered our food to the wrong table, and when the table rejected it, they left it at the front.  After not being served for 30 minutes, we inquired and they handed us the COLD food and seemed shocked that we'd ask for it to be heated up.

Overall, chill place, bad service (but that just adds to the charm, right?), and vermin.  I'd still come back here, though I would never order anything fresh."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been here several times and I've always enjoyed myself. The food and drinks are cheap and the atmosphere is just awesome. I always go upstairs cause it's got this awesome hipster vibe to it! The patio is cool too. It's definitely hard to find, and especially hard to describe how to find it, but once you're there, you're all set. I recommend that everyone give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Probably the cheapest place in Toronto. Pitchers of the usual variety going like hot bread, few decent choices (like Big Wheel). I tried the food here before I read the other reviews for the numerous infestations in the past, but I believe that was years before, don't think it's a problem anymore, the food was pretty delicious (Thai glass noodles). Yet, I would probably avoid it now.

The place gets PACKED after 10 PM with large groups, plan not to come too late if you want to get in as people just stay the whole night. It's also very loud, all these people shouting over each other, but that's how dive bars are supposed to be.

Staff is nice, but order twice the quantity cause it may be half hour or more before they come around again, two or three people working a full 2nd floor.

Basically great for a group to get knackered on cheap booze and have a good ol' time."}
{"text":"So I've heard a lot of hullabaloo over the Green Room since moving to Toronto. For the most part, I've heard great things about this \"super hip hidden gem\" near Bloor. 

I'm sorry but I was royally disappointed. 

Now, it must be said on the Green Room's part that I was quite intoxicated so a second opinion may be necessary but usually my impairment helps a venue's chances in gaining my love, and will swerve my opinion to that of a more favorable tone when I am on nightly outings, so it is not saying much for the Green Room that despite my intoxication, I still did not like the joint.

I did like the atmosphere of the place, kind of a Hogwarts, hole in the wall kind of thing going on there, but that's pretty much where the excitement stops. The waitresses were all really grumpy or depressed, or something, and granted, yes it was very busy, but then don't be a waitress at a student bar! The service was really slow. 

And the worst part of the whole thing, devastatingly and quite unfortunately on my part, I partook in the consumption of a rather stingily constructed nacho plate. And just as my intoxication impairs my judgment of various venues when I am out, veiling them with a positive glow, it also impairs my ability to be sensible and logical when certain items of food are placed in front of me. The logical decision would have been not to scarf down those nachos which were quite disgusting. Sadly for the Green Room, my impairment was not enough to paint the memory of those nachos in a positive veil this morning. 

Will have to go back to determine if I really can't stand this place. I can tell you one thing, I won't be ordering their nacho plate ever again."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the Green Room in probably about five years or so. It seems from some of the reviews that it has closed and opened again since they, maybe even more than once.  It was however the exact same Green Room I remember from days gone by. 

Met my friend here so we could have a short meeting to decide some details for the group we all volunteer for. Sitting on the couches, drinking wine and going over some information was just perfect. We even ordered a couple of appetizers which were surprisingly pretty tasty.

It did eventually get a little loud for a meeting, but luckily we're done by this time and just gabbing. I think the best part was the bill at the end. CHEAP!  Great place to come if you don't want a huge selection of drinks but just want something cheap and cozy."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance, the selection is fine, but the service is a little off. I waited 20 minutes for wait staff to refresh my drink... and it took them 5 minutes to get me my first one. It was a Tuesday at like 6, there wasnt much of a crowd to excuse it. It might sound like I'm exaggerating, but this third time I went in there, I actually decided to time it because it had happened to me before. I wonder if it's one of those places that sort of thrives when crowded instead, I'm willing to give it another go and see if that's the case."}
{"text":"Why do I go to the Green Room? Well, because it's close to where I live. And if anyone else lives in the Annex they can tell you: there really aren't many options. Or rather, there aren't really many decent options. Actually, there's really nothing decent at all. 

Now, to the point: the Green Room is a reliable venue. You know it's always going to be there and it's always going to be busy. On Friday and Saturday nights it can be hard finding a table, and since the sound carries poorly, it's usually hard to concentrate or focus on any sort of constructive conversation with the person or people you're with. The good thing though: most people don't have constructive conversations after a couple of pints (though they always seem to think they do).

There are two floors, and of the two floors I prefer the first. Many people will probably tell you that the upstairs \"is an entirely different vibe,\" and it is. Louder music, rowdier people. If you're into that, awesome! If there are no table downstairs, chances are you may-may-may be able to find one upstairs.

The best thing about the Green Room is the entrance, located in the alley. If you bring out-of-towers to the bar they'll probably say something like, \"Are you taking me to get raped?\" And you'll say something like, \"No, I'm taking you to the Green Room.\" They like that."}
{"text":"As other Yelpers noted, the staff here will try to overcharge your bill. Keep an extremely careful list of what your group orders as mine was forced to pay for a pitcher we already paid for. We were awkwardly forced back into the venue where staff accused my group of not paying for a pitcher. The staff are aggressive, act like a gang, and could care less about the venue's reputation. When we explained that we had paid, they brought out a bouncer to intimidate us. My group later reconciled expenses and calculated that we had in fact paid for everything we ordered. If you're coming for the drinks, there's nothing but a small bland collection of options. You're much better off going to any bar in Ossington or Queen Street West. Never returning here, and will definitely let others know not to."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, cheap food, convenient location, full of young people (mostly college kids) service is suuuuppeeer slow and the food it's pretty bad, but then again it's really cheap so I guess you pay for what you get, if you can go somewhere else, do it."}
{"text":"With cheap drinks and lots of space, most Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights see The Green Room packed with the college crowd.  Playing albums from all sorts of indie bands, this is a great hangout for people who aren't really into Top 40 or classic rock.  

They have a surprisingly big menu, with sandwiches and Thai food, amongst other bar essentials.  When you ask for the plain nachos (melted cheese and chips, that's it) you will get what I believe to be the cheesiest nachos in the city.

They also serve the most inexpensive breakfast I've seen.  For $3.50, you can get a full breakfast including eggs, bacon, fries, salad and toast.  It's not the best tasting breakfast, but very affordable and fun once in a while."}
{"text":"Only giving a one star because that's the minimum (would give -googolplex if i could). But this was the absolute worst establishment i have ever been to. I had searched online for reviews about this place and heard that they will over charge people they think are drunk. However, my boyfriend and his friends still insisted on coming. The group consisted of me. my boyfriend and 3 other girls. We were charged wrong on the first bill and then when i informed them abut their mistake they recalculated the bill. But that bill was wrong again and they tried to charge us extra for the second bill as well. The extra charge was only $20 (which I'm fine with paying) but when i tried to let them know that it was incorrect they tried to throw me out (especially the asian guy, the rest of the workers were okay with admitting they could have been wrong).  I didn't want a refund as i had already paid for the bill but i wanted an admittance of guilt; an admittance that someone could have overcharged us or someone could have been wrong. But the asian guy kept denying it and said I was wrong and the rest of my party was wrong and that he would give us an extra drink so long as we would never return. My group and I decided that it was not about the amount that we paid but the fact that there could have been a mistake on their behalf that pushed us to the edge. If they could have admitted to some guilt we would have been fine. But the fact that when we tried to refute the bill and then they tried to kick us out was completely unethical. We will never return nor do we recommend anyone coming back here. This is the absolute hands down most disgusting establishment I have ever been to with the worst staff as well as customer service.

PS honestly if you think my review is fake and biased hit me up at 647 529 1212 and I will tell you the truth about this pathetic place."}
{"text":"Great food selections, there is something for everybody! The low prices also are great for people who are going out on a budget. Good service, as well."}
{"text":"I don't get this place. - I don't know if it's because I didn't go to UofT, or if it's because I don't wear hemp pants.... I just don't get this place. 

I've been numerous times in the past, but this is far from my bar of choice... probably last on my list of places to go socialize next to that shwarma/juice place next to the Bloor Cinema. 

The one and only interesting part about this place is the location/exterior... it is kind of a cool feeling going around back through an alleyway to check this place out.... It felt like I was one of those degenerate Teenagers walking into the Foot Clan Warehouse in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.... so exclusive and cool... I went in with a Go Ninja Go Ninja Go... and Left with a No Ninja No Ninja No - I truly appreciated the exterior upon leaving the establishment... as the experience inside Green Room felt more like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3..... 

You walk in, and you truly have no idea what's going on.... dark.... really loud music... tables scattered everywhere in no particular fashion ... with a group of 15 people standing in front of the doorway. You don't know if they're waiting for tables, or waiting for friends, or leaving, or just as confused as I was when I first entered this place years ago.

This wasn't my first rodeo, so I proceed upstairs as I know the seating upstairs tends to be pretty ample. Go upstairs only to experience the same thing downstairs...again....  Dark, scattered tables, loud music, and people standing around without being greeted or served. I only saw one guy who worked there and he was at the top of the stairs sweeping.... and that's about it.

Okay Okay Okay.... I get it.... it's a trendy hip place where you end up seating yourself.... I know.... I can't fault them for that.... but here is the kicker: 

Sat down at a table, it was next to a radiator that was BURNING HOT... so we had to get up and find another place to sit, this booth had glassware from a previous party.. so we ended up tossing the glasses aside to another table...someone walked by to grab them... yet didn't acknowledge that we just sat down and wanted to place an order. We waited 15 minutes, and in the next break in the conversation - I stood up and said, \"I'm going to the bar to get our rounds\". 

Went to the bar - walked past the same guy sweeping - and aside from him there was no one at the bar! I waited 2 minutes and two people magically appeared, rabbits out of a hat, and they made me two drinks. 

Drinks were cheap in comparison to other places in the Annex... but I'd rather pay the extra buck or two and get great service.... even poor service... this was just an absence of service. 

After that round, we weren't acknowledged or served after going up... we decided to get one more round at the bar. As I waited, I noticed the bartender who served me was now taking orders at tables, but this time he was wearing a hat....

Do they just have one person who works there that has their own tickle trunk behind the bar? Taking out random items that gives the illusion of having a properly staffed establishment? 

Hat
Monocle
Broom

Which reminds me! ... The Sweeping guy! He went back to sweep the initial spot I discovered him at.... what's the deal with that guy?! The issue with this place is that there is no system, it was all willy nilly! 

They got the sweeping covered... but nothing else ! 

The bartender is out from behind the bar covering sections in a disguise.... the waitresses' were hiding in the top hat, and the ceilings were on the roof... the whole place was topsy turvy! 

AND THE PEOPLE... don't get me started on the people...

Patrons were taking out fruit containers from Metro and eating it at the table..... knocking drinks over themselves/each other, knocking chairs/decorations over without picking them up...It was like sitting in a den of thieves... hipster thieves. I've never wanted to inflict pain on so many people in one place at one time.... EVER. 

I guess I figured out why they have a guy constantly sweeping, but the rest remains a mystery. 

If it were me, I'd hire more staff... provide better service....and get the guy who is sweeping to start punching people in the throat for acting like jerk offs."}
{"text":"I enjoy a good, lively, dark dive bar.  And that's what Green Room is, a bit of a dive bar.  There's nothing particularly WRONG with it, it's just not for me.  Green Room is a bar that offers food.  The bathrooms are not really accessible and the bathrooms are gendered.  The menu is barely vegan friendly, unless you'd like a salad or french fries.  

My friend and I visited on a Tuesday.  The main floor was packed, and unfortunately had a bit of a septic system smell, so we found a seat upstairs.  There was lots of seating and was perfect for large groups.  There were a few large, loud groups of early 20's who all looked like they were having a good time.

It took about 15 minutes to get service and menus.  This was not the staff's fault.  From what I could see, there were 2 waiters for about 50-75 people, and people trying to get service at the bar.  Our waiter was very nice, but it was obvious he and the other waiter were spread too thin.  It took about 25 minutes to get a plate of okay nachos, which is slow.

As I said earlier, there's nothing horribly wrong with Green Room, and if you have a large group, this place would be great.  They have a few sections with some nice, wood benches.  But for me, a bar that smells like a bathroom, with few to no vegan options, slow service, unmemorable food, inaccessible bathrooms and a wait staff that you almost feel bad for does not make me want to return."}
{"text":"oohhhh the green room is not for the faint of heart!!! This is a GRUNNNGGGYYYY bar. So grungy you can't even see it from the street, you have to kind of walk into a dark alley where the entrance to the bar faces a parking lot. It's old and crumbly, but it has so much character it's hard not to love!

There are steep stairs that take you to the second floor or you can hit up a backyard-type patio when it's warmer. You can smoke there too - whoohooo! 

Upstairs you have an array of couches and seating areas of all shapes and sizes. Decorated with Christmas lights and curtains that hang from the ceiling, and absolutely unrelated wall pictures - this place is heaven for the hipster within you or a poor college student.

The food was a-ok we got nachos and they were standard, i was secretly hoping the kitchen has recently passed a health check :) The beer and whatever other drinks people ordered were cheap too.

GO HERE PEOPLE! If you're picky and want leather chairs that match each other and no drunken youngins, don't go here. The atmosphere is awesome and if you let loose you will meet a ton of awesome people :)

PS Sangria is great here - try it!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst place i have ever gone. Zero service. Always with an empty drink. Apathetic and complacent servers who stare at you down their prissy little hipster noses. What a bunch of hacks. You make tips by serving. Not by having your customers hunt you down for drinks. I even hunted them down for the bill! I could have walked out unnoticed!!!! Must be nice to be so fuckin' bored and annoyed all the time. Zero tip for you hipster"}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered a weird dish, but the veggie burger here did not taste good at all. I think there was kale or something in the burger/sauce? Some of you may like that, but I sure didn't. The nachos however were generous and loaded with cheese. 

The service was nice though. Overall, not a bad place for nachos."}
{"text":"The Green Room is tucked away behind Bloor Street in the Annex. It's one of those places that's pretty hard to find unless someone tells you where to go. Chances are you'll never stumble upon it all on your own. It's a University hang out for the most part. Both food and drinks are stupid-cheap. I'm always amazed at how low the bill is whenever I come. Of course, the food kind of sucks, so there that. I think avocado sandwich is probably the best thing they make. I'd avoid getting beer on tap here, because i'm pretty sure they are do some sketchy-ass stuff with it. I've seen them pour beer between pitchers in the kitchen, and they keep poured pitchers in the fridge. The service also kind of sucks. Still, I love this place in the dead of winter. It's dark and warm and, on an off night, quiet."}
{"text":"I don't want to hate on the Green Room too much because the upstairs is a nice place to hang out for some beer. But the fables (and recent closures) have made me think twice about coming here. I have only ordered the food once and even though it was decent it certainly didn't leave me with the impression of a \"place to have dinner.\" There have been times I've been downstairs and have seen mice running around, which is never a good sign. The staff upstairs are friendly and nice, but efficiency is certainly not their strength. I was once there on a very slow night (maybe only two other tables upstairs) and the girl took our order (pitcher of beer) and then came back 20 minutes later and asked if we needed anything. Ooops.

Definitely a spot I liked going to when I was younger but now that I am almost in my mid-30s hanging out with a bunch of loud college kids with dodgy draft beer is not exactly an ideal decision for me. But if you are still in University and like cheap drinks and food (and not picky about cleanliness) then this is right up your alley."}
{"text":"I go here for cheap beers and big serving of nachos - if I had a choice there would be no stars, but alas that option is not available - and I should show some appreciation for the cheap food, so one star it is.

I don't expect service.
I don't even expect to be seated - some times if I'm lucky I may score a patio seat in the summer time.
It was a great joint - brought many groups(we're talking 10 or more) of people here to enjoy what little hopitality they offer- and well, no more.
I never had good service but  I never expected to be grilled for tips.

Each and every time I went  the server had the audacity to say to me, \"That's not enough tip\"... I worked in the hospitality industry for a long while and I tend to tip at least 10% even for the crustiest service, because can relate. But apparently the 10% tip is not enough for this place. A friend of mine once left a $5 tip on a $25 bill - which is close to 20% - and the waiter said to him, \"are you sure?\"  to which my friend said, \"Yeah it's all yours\" and the waiter resonded, \"No I don't think so. You know we live off tips, right? this is just not enough.\"

So he ended up with no tip.

I have not been back there since.
There are plenty of great places with great service that also service cheap beer and food - without staff that ask for bigger tip."}
{"text":"After going to the Green Room for about ten years, I now find I'm starting to feel a bit out of place on the busier evenings. The combination of cheap beer (which, I find, is more likely to leave you with a hangover than other bars) and a good 'bar-like' atmosphere understandably draws new arrivals from nearby U of T. It doesn't detract from the enjoyment, however, as the crowd is always mixed. It is occasionally hard not to feel a little old when the place is full of 18 year-olds, though.

My one complaint about the Green Room in the evening might seem silly, but it's that the music is too loud, and totally sporadic in quality. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's awful. I don't say that as a music snob either; it's just that it sometimes feels inappropriate for the setting. And as someone who tends to be soft-spoken, I just can't have a conversation here. Sometimes that's fine, but more often, it's really annoying. 

During the day, however, this place is still quiet, charming and relatively empty, and the fact that you can have lunch with a pint for well under 15 bucks is great. 

It's hard to shake the nostalgia of this place. I guess as I long live in the Annex, I'll keep heading back here. I just wish that, in the evenings, they'd turn the damn music down."}
{"text":"Love the look and Interesting ambiance of this place.  The entrance is down an alley covered in graffiti and very rustic inside.  Doorway looks like a speakeasy from days gone by!  There is a good size patio on the ground floor and great room upstairs with a bar area.  Meeting upstairs is great for groups as our group of 15 did.  We were able to converse and hear each other even with the music playing in the background.  
A couple of folks in my group ordered sangria's and they looked great in the tall glass and tasted great as well.  White or red sangria was available.  Good variety of beer and great prices on the pitchers to share.
Great prices and great choices in the menu with a wide variety of appetizers as well as mains.
Interesting variety of soups with Lentil, Beef Satay and tried the Seafood Udon which was delicious with nice juicy noodles.
I ordered the Vermicelli noodles special with lemongrass pork which comes with fresh lettuce, cabbage, peppers and carrots.  Also comes with a crispy spring roll on top,  Very unique flavors and thoroughly enjoyed.

Will certainly go back as there are a number of interesting items on the menu to try and just love the feel of the place."}
{"text":"Green Room is a great place to go to if you want to have some drinks in a casual setup. Their food isn't the best, but their beer prices are pretty affordable."}
{"text":"Super cheap food, decent quality.  Upstairs could get a little loud at times.  We were sitting across a tiny table, but found that we had to scream and shout to be heard.  Drinks were cheap and decent.  Didn't get the best server around, but I guess that's what you get for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"very nice dive bar. it's loud, i dunno about cozy. i think of cozy as quiet and chill. there are couches if that's cozy for you.

anyways, good selection of beer, very reasonably priced, they got an outside patio that's pretty nice. unfortunately all the seats there were taken.

i really enjoyed this bar. good place to take friends and have a few drinks."}
{"text":"This is my favorite favorite favorite bar in Toronto. The food is cheap and delicious, the atmosphere is cozy and artsy(reminds me of a more hip Brooklyn Tea Lounge), and the drinks are good. They're always playing my favorite music. 

There have been a few tiffs with staff but nothing too bad (or completely unwarranted). I'm in New York now but I always wish I could magically beam myself back for an evening of fun."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I have been there twice now.  Once with 'friends' from work, and another time with actual friends.  If you're looking for a classy place, this is not it.  The entrance is in an alley behind the South-Side of Bloor Street in clear view of a bunch of dumpsters.  If you haven't been scared away yet, feel free to enter into a dark room, which, in it's former days would undoubtedly have been smokey also.  I will save you suspense - the room is not green.  I have no idea why it's called that, but it doesn't really matter.

The downstairs is full of tables and the back wall has three sections filled with sofas.  These are major low-riders.  I haven't seen anyone pass out or fall asleep on them yet, but you can bet it's happened.

The servers are very nice, the beer is cheap as hell, and the menus are full of delectable pub foods.  Each time I've went, our group has swigged pint after pint of cheap draft beer, followed by wings, fries and pita and hummus.  The pita and hummus I would not repeat, but the wings are to die for!

I'm not a big wing person.  For some reason, I hate eating messy things.  Like if it gets all over your face and hands, it's not worth it.   I like crispy wings that are not oozing in sauce.   Their wings are right up my alley.  But they come with sauce to dunk in, if that's your thing.

There is an upstairs too, where I have not spent any significant amount of time aside from numerous trips to the washroom.  

Anecdotally, I must confirm what other reviews have said about \"not looking too closely in shadowy corners.\"  We were sitting on the sofas on Friday 10/17/09 and saw a mouse pop out... go back under.... pop out.... go back under.  We were enjoyably buzzed by this point, and decided to find it cute.  Outside on the entry, there was a poster saying Toronto Public Health had just inspected the Green Room less than a month before, and it had passed.  Those city inspectors must be doing a bang up job."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. Although I'm in this neighbourhood a lot I never knew this place existed until a friend suggested it. Love the eclectic, ramshackle decor. Food was cheap and good, service was friendly. I'll come again!"}
{"text":"this place overall is OK! 
i mean the place is really loud, the food is not that bad but for sure not the best!

If i have to come to  this place is for the cheap drinks, you have a lot of choices for usually less than 20 bucks but overall the cocktails taste like juices and same with the sangria! At least the pitcher is really cheap and you have choice in beer.

The service is bad, there i said it! Your order can be lost in a black hole and it's so hard to call the waiters or even distinguish them with the customers. 
The waiters are really mean and not friendly, i know its a busy place and some people can be jerks but still!"}
{"text":"I always felt cool and very Toronto snobbish when I introduced new-to-town friends to the Green Room - as in \"what? you've never been to the Green Room?\"  and then I lead them down an alley that you'd probably not go down otherwise.  Boo-yah, I'm just *that* cool.

Inside it reminds me of high school and the 90s, old sofa's that just make me want to bust out my flannel lumberjack jacket and bell bottoms.  Not to say this place is dirty (you can't tell, it's dark) but it definitely takes me back to my teen years, right down to the candles burning in wine bottles.

Of course, extra points of high-school-cool if you score your own little sofa area to enjoy some cheap eats and booze. My only issue is the sometimes too loud music that really interferes with conversation. They also have this amazing little patio which is so lovely and secluded on a summer day.  All in all, I love the Green Room, I love the atmosphere, the memories it reminds me of, the food, and the fact that I feel like I'm in a secret club house!"}
{"text":"This place is great for people who are on a budget. It's an ideal place for students and to just chill out with friends for cheap. Their food is pretty good for it's extreme low price. 

Service is sometimes slow because it does get busy. Drinks are cheap and my favorite is their sangria pitcher for only $14 (TOTAL STEAL). I come here regularly and it's always a good time."}
{"text":"How does this place have 3.5 stars?  If you have any taste whatsoever you will never go here.  The beer is cheap, yes, but the food is disgusting and this place should be shut down imo.  Nachos were $12 with chicken addon (few pieces still cold), and a layer that did not feed one person out of four.  Nachos and cheese were stuck to aluminum foil, some of which was consumed.  This place is disgusting.  The women's bathrooms did not flush, and the manager doesn't give a sh*t.  Anyway we had a pregnant bartender who was very rude.  We had to get our bill adjusted, and she threw the pen and a fit at us for asking to separate the bill (simple).  We had to speak to the manager, and she fulfilled this request.  Crap food, terrible service, extremely slow in collecting bill payment (over 40 mins.)."}
{"text":"Went to the Green Room with some friends...it's an alley bar off Brunswick near Bloor.  This place is pretty funky....cool decor...chandaliers, mismatched furniture and the heavy scent of nincese in the air.  From what I was told, this place has been there forever it looks the part.

It was full, but not overcrowded for a Saturday night.  We managed to get a table on the back patio, but we had to wait for some people to vacate.  We just got drinks, the prices are reasonable, but if you are looking for an extensive or exotic beer selection, look elsewhere.  This place will have your standards at a good price.  The waitstaff are friendly and accomodating.  There is a food menu, but we did not partake.

All in all, it was a comfortable place to go have some drinks with some friends."}
{"text":"It's very dim and has great music playing, good vibe, it was empty when I went though so I'm not sure what noise is like. Ordered a couple tequila shots and a red sangria pitcher ($13.50 on Saturdays) which was made with apples, which weren't fresh at all. But you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is rad. Cheap beer, great ambience. I love dark, dank places. I'm visiting from NYC and love finding non touristy places like this. My BF and I love cheap beer and getting drunk on comfy couches so. We're easy like that. We were quite happy. Good music playing, the avocado Brie sandwich was out of control. Can't wait to visit TO again and come back."}
{"text":"Here's The Thing: This is not a dive bar. This is not a Thai dive. This is not even a dive opium den. As some of the world sees the ruse of faking orgasms as a ruse to make blood boil, if you fake being a dive on me, I get pissed. I get feisty. I become the tantrum you're not interested in. Don't fake being a dive bar. Bottom line. It's the epitome of why old people don't like young people: it's why Brooklyn in 1992 hates the current future that attempts to be Brooklyn in 1992. 

I asked for: \"Give me the dive-y-ist, dankest most bizarre earth house that's a bar that serves food.\" Answer: \"well, there's this place that always had a cat, was shut down for rats in its kitchen known for dirt cheap thai food and serves shit sangrias.\" I then looked to The Source here and all the reviews said the same thing. It also passed the vaunted Sticky Floor Test: search \"Sticky Floor\" on Yelp, and you're 99 out of 100 times going to get a dive. This time I did not. Now I'll admit, I asked for a dive-y food dive bar, which is a twist on the classic. However, especially in this case when the world weaves in food into a dive it typically trends to the other end of the alley, where no one would ever go, let alone eat.

We walk in, and it's packed -- way too packed for a dive. And everyone was happy. We find a table for two in the back and I immediately realize... there's not even a bar here. Yeah, there's a corner of the room where they stock booze and serve from, but there is not a place for my Uncle to faint off a stool with bloody elbows. No bar. No bueno. 

The allure of the $15 Sangria pitcher kept me there. And the noticeably $6 Pad Thai. 48 ounces of Sangria, two fists of noodles for $20. Four pints of more sprite than red wine later, I found myself next to the one I came to Toronto for in a nook in a corner in an entirely packed room under dim lights, dark walls and Amsterdam teenager art wondering: if this is Toronto's concept of a dive bar, how did a city survive for so long and prosper with 5 million people without having a true dive in their midst?

Don't worry, there's no cliffhanger: there are definitely dives in Toronto. Great ones. Maybe the best I've seen and I feel like I only tasted just the tip of the smut that happens in this town (read: I watched a man refuse the call from a woman to go to the House of Lancer, so there's more to go.) But for this place to attempt to pass as a dive bar, and for others to continue to tell them they are, they're wrong. If someone can promise me that the moment I step inside the Green Room, my foot sticks to the floor and that cat curls up on my leg in complete silence, and an old man tells me about the time he duped the Nazis with his Bayonet named The Fake Orgasm, then I'll call it a dive."}
{"text":"Three years ago I would have given this place a 5 stars. I would have been raving to all my friends about going there a friday night, to load up on beers and enjoy the atmosphere before hitting another place. I would have held my birthday party there and took advantage of the patio. I probably would have been on first name basis with all the servers and bartenders.

Today, I honestly found the place too loud and the crowd too young for my liking. It is a college bar with a college feel. I met an old friend there for after-work drinks a few weeks ago. I could barely hear myself think. I couldnt concentrate on anything my friend said, she was even ticked off thinking I wasnt paying attention. 

Bottome line, the drinks were a decent price and the food was pretty good. If I was 21 again, I would hang out there. But I'm not. And I dont think I will be back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was here recently during the daytime and had an okay experience. I think they're getting stricter on underage drinking because me and my friend were asked for our IDs for the first time...ever. 
There was only one girl tending to all the patrons and it was quite difficult to flag her down. Upstairs was closed at first but opened later during our stay. 
We ordered a pitcher of Sapporo which was reasonably priced and a plate of their sweet potato fries, which are seriously the best I've ever had. I doubt they make it themselves so I'm dying to find out where they buy them from. 
Weird occurrence of the night: the pitcher of Sapporo didn't taste like Sapporo at all and when our other friend joined us an hour later at our table, she thought we had ordered Canadian upon tasting it. The beer was extremely flat and more bitter than I remembered it being. The second pitcher we ordered was Pabst which tasted like Pabst so not all was lost."}
{"text":"Sure a mixed bag of reviews about this place. Hell, let the whiners stay away. 

I loved the dark, cozy ambiance (couches and candles), the delicious avocado and brie sandwich on thick wheat bread, the strong, tasty vodka tonics and the friendly bartenders. The hummus was tasty, too - LOTS of veggie options - and tasted of mustard mixed with the squished garbanzos. And having an afternoon of Beatles music at the perfect level for either reading or gabbing - serendipitous.

Wish it was in my neighbourhood to be my local...."}
{"text":"One of the best dives ever!  Cheap as hell, dirty as hell, but such a good vibe and the food & drink is much better than the prices would suggest.  The place is dark & interestingly decorated.  Crummy furniture adds to the feel.  Full meal for two including appetizer, mains, dessert, and wine came to $32!  lol!  
The place gets pretty busy on weekends, so plan on spending a bit of time here if you come."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Green Room for years, but haven't really frequented it as much as I used to since I graduated from uni. The clientele is known to be of a younger demographic, but I personally find that crowds are usually well and pleasantly mixed.

This is a great place to go with a large group of friends to celebrate a birthday on weekends. It's also a good place to go with just a few of you to catch up on quieter weeknights. The music is really loud, but the booths and tables are intimately candle lit and cozy enough to chat closely in. The music selection can be a toss up though. Some nights, the music is just perfect background noise, but on other nights, (like last night), it sounded like someone with quite eclectic taste put their iPod on shuffle - which is probably exactly what was going on. The abrupt changes from jazz to metal to pop was a little hard to ignore or enjoy. 

There is one thing you can always count on though: the food is ridiculously cheap. I've been a fan of the Thai style stir-fried glass noodles ($6.50) forever. Many of my friends love the pad thai, but it's much too tomato-pastey for my taste. Drinks are also very cheap. I'm usually happy splitting a pitcher of sangria ($17.50), but opted for a litre of the house white wine ($21 on the menu, but $19.95 on the bill) instead. Enjoyable. 

It's not all fun and games though. There was an awful rotting smell lingering near the doorway and last night was not the first time that I've noticed this. Oh, and the lock on the toilet stall door wasn't all that trusty. There may have been an awkward surprise door opening on me while I was going about my business (but that really doesn't need to be mentioned anymore beyond these cautionary purposes). Hey, you get what you pay for, but there are some nights when cheap and cheerful will do the job spendidly."}
{"text":"This place is great for cheap drinks. A cocktail (while pretty diluted and tastes like jolly ranchers) is only 7 bucks."}
{"text":"Green Room is really meh for me. 

I used to frequent it quite a bit in '07/'08 when I lived nearby. At first I loved the decor - student looking artwork, Christmas lights, old couches.

Nowadays, I'm usually subjected to the Green Room once or twice a year when my friend from BC comes back into town and insists on holding his reunion/catch up party here.

As mentioned in other reviews, the booze and food are cheap. The service is mediocre. The food, in my opinion, is pretty bad but OK considering the cheapness. 

The management is terrible. I've been in a few times when it's packed and the Chinese lady manager can be a real nazi, moving patrons around and rudely dictating which specific table you are allowed to sit at.

I think if you're a student you will probably like this place. If you're 25+ I would just give it a pass and go some place a little more \"sophistimicated\""}
{"text":"3.5 stars
The Green Room is open once again!
While they've done away with the candles in beer bottles, little else has changed with the Annex classic, and even the oddball crowd has slowly started to make their way back to the hideout! The 'hidden patio' is still packed weather permitting, and the cool artwork is still up despite the apparent change in ownership.
Drinks are still on the cheap though service is a bit slower than before! Hopefully this is the slow beginning of a revival, and things will start to look up again... or maybe nothing has changed and I'm just starting to grow up.

Give the Green Room a try if you haven't before and are into dark divey bars!"}
{"text":"As a visitor to Toronto, the Green Room was an oasis of inexpensive comfort food in a desert of overpriced eateries. 

Also, I felt like I was in college again. It wasn't just the crowd, but the atmosphere and the food. Slightly shabby and grubby, but not enough to worry you about the food hygiene. Music blasting, but not so loud you had to yell to be heard. Server with attitude, but still cracked a smile when I joked with her.

I'll return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"For a first time visitor, finding the Green Room might be as hard as finding the lost city of Atlantis. Tucked away in some dodgy alley behind dumpsters, the two floor establishment offers enough seating space all year round. The ambiance is very much consistent with the whole funky bohemian thing going on in the Annex. The patio, perhaps the jewel crown of Green Room, is very charming and intimate, adorned with old Christmas lights and candles after dusk. 

The food and drinks are cheap and delicious. Domestic beer pints are less than $5 and pitchers go for about $12. I love the small yet decent beer selection. Amsterdam Big Wheel, Blonde, 416; Blanche de Chambly; FM Hoptical Illusion etc. Sangrias are also on the menu. The food ranges from typical bar staples to Pad Thai (which is quite good and very cheap). Appetizers feature sweet potato fries for about $4, which come with their delicious chipotle mayo (the king of condiments). They bring the bottle of the mayo to your table."}
{"text":"Call me tacky but I love a place that can pull off Christmas in July with lights strung along the bars in no particular way all year long. As a regular hangout for Annex yuppies and U of T student this place was pretty quite on a weekday, with ample seating compared to weekends! 

The menu and drinks are super cheap (my friend and I had a beer, chicken sandwich and fries each and one salad...the whole thing came to $27!!!) The food was good with tons of veggie options and most items under $10, but I found the service was rather slow given how many patrons were there. 

The music was great they played an entire Elvis Costello and Dusty Springfeild record while I was there....classic!

Great hangout place...beware it gets loud on weekends!"}
{"text":"I had a good time here last night, the service isn't good, understandable when it gets busy and i kind of like the student dive bar atmosphere-- which is why I like this place. BUT I think everyone should know that they include a 15% gratuity in the bill, and saying 'it's all included' apparently wasn't enough of a hint for me, especially when the tip option appears immediately when you get the interac machine. They must do really well, these servers, because people are so used to tipping, and can easily get tricked out of 30% if they don't scrutinize their bill. Truthfully I was annoyed when I found out afterwards! Automatic gratuity is appropriate only in large parties of 8 or more AND doing auto grats is clearly not an incentive for your servers to give good service."}
{"text":"I used to really love coming to this place.  The more recent visits have been disappointing.  I used to love the soups but now they taste watered down and possibly from mixes.  The vegetable noodle rolls were tasty and the Sangria fun.  It was an expensive place but the food was once good and the little patio was delightful.  I really hope they can get back to their roots because I would like to enjoy this place again.  Now it is just there.  Nothing to rave about because they are competing with their own past greatness."}
{"text":"The Green Room doesn't try to pretend to be what it isn't. And it isn't a fancy bar. The atmosphere is usually packed with university students, the music is a bearable volume, the food is cheap and the drinks are cheaper. Great place to go to hang out with a group. The patio is a decent spot if you can manage to get a seat. Otherwise, upstairs is where you'll find a bunch of different crowds. They also do off the menu drinks, just ask!"}
{"text":"The Green Room, just like it's sister joints Java & Nirvana, offers great, cheap food and a really mellow atmosphere. Every time I've been there I've found it to be more of a university student hangout than a hipster haven.

They have a menu filled with super cheap food -- great sandwiches, some Asian dishes, and a random assortment of other food, I'd say almost all of it is good. Some staples are the Avocado & Brie sandwich (get it with soup, their soups are actually decent), the Deep Fried Tofu, and the Pad Thai. There is a bit of ketchup in the sauce but it still tastes strangely delicious.

I remember having a really hard time finding it years ago -- it's down a little alley and seems really intimidating at first, but just go in, sit down anywhere, and as long as someone sees you, they'll help you right away. A couple times the service has been slow, but not unbearably so, and the staff have always been polite and apologetic.

My one and only warning -- if you're on the patio in nicer weather, watch out for wasps. They love it there, and they're annoying as hell."}
{"text":"It's well documented that there's no better way for two late-20-somethings to spend a Monday night than doing a drinking-and-cycling tour of Bloor/Dupont.  Green Room bookended just such an idyllic evening for just such a pair earlier this week.  

Deeply committed to ignoring age and responsibility for being alive the next morning, our heros bumbled into Green Room after three previous cycling breaks for pints.  Clear of the normal student bustle, the sprawl of Green Room's two floors and patio was free to impress.  The patio is pretty, lush with all of the plants and lit with Christmas lights.  Stairs on both the inside mainfloor and patio give access to the second floor which has its own bar.

One pitcher of PBR and competent (for bar food) plate of nachos later, the dishevelled duo squared away their $24 bill and mounted their bikes in search of well-earned rest, vowing to return to Green Room on some other night where they would be able to enjoy the atmosphere without ridicule from their less-than-contemporaries."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have said, this is a student hotspot (it's right in The Annex) and it's clearly very popular because it's always teeming with people!! Yes, the cleanliness of the place sometimes leaves a bit to be desired and the service can be slow at peak times, but you can't beat the prices (honestly, sometimes I have to do a double take to make sure they actually charged me for everything) and the location/atmosphere are great! 

I love the massive bean and rice burrito (it's something ridiculous like $3 for one) and the colossal pitchers of sangria - or as my guy friends like to call it: MANgria. 

Great place for very large groups and to really let loose - the place is loud and boisterous and everyone is welcome!"}
{"text":"Do not under any circumstances eat here or drink beer out of a glass. Four-point-five stars if you order a cheap cheap bottle of beer and resign yourself to the environs. One-point-five stars if you eat or drink anything else. Toronto DineSafe knows what they're doing, heed their warning."}
{"text":"I don't really go anymore.  Or rather, I haven't been in a while.  But my memories are fond.
Yeah, there are a lot of cool things about this bar...  You enter an alley way to get inside, it has two levels of very relaxed and eclectic atmosphere and one of the coolest patios, in my opinion in the city.  It's a walled in patio, complete with a pond and a mettle stairwell...  
I hope the Pad Thai is as good as I remember it.
A great place to get a cheap, cold pitcher of beer or sangria.  
Just ignore the mice that scurry across the floor.  Unless they have done something about that now."}
{"text":"Cheap, private, comfortable place to go. I've been here multiple times. The upstairs closes really early, which is unfortunate because it super hot downstairs. The food is just ok. The nachos are disappointing, calamari is not worth it, the sweet potato fries are pretty bomb. But what I love about this place is the sangria. It's so delicious but not sweet or bitter. I can drink it like its nothing, but it's actually pretty strong and kicks a punch later on. Sundays have cheaper sangria so make sure to check it out then!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but this place has now closed. Check out Pour Boy at 666 Manning Avenue if you want to relive the good times.

RIP Green Room. You were a lot of things to a lot of people, but you were Toronto."}
{"text":"19 year old Evelyn W would be mad at *slightly* older Evelyn W for giving this place only two stars. Good thing she lives in the past and can't actually see this review. 

This place still exists as it once was, with mismatched velvet furniture, tables that wobble at all heights and in all textures and two levels of crappy fun. Green plastic patio and fire escape included. 

The sangria is still too sweet and the pad thai is still edible. 

The Green Room just isn't really a dive or a kooky joint, but remains ideal for students who want something not student-y and dark to get drunk in with that special someone on the cheap. 

PEPPER PAUSES and asks: What happened to the cat that used to chase away the mice? Rest in peace, fluffy."}
