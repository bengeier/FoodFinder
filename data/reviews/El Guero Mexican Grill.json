{"text":"I tried El Guero last week. I am very new to yelp. be honest I didnt like it very much,   its good if you are drunk and nothing is open late then you can eat it. but if you are specially going there for lunch or dinner please don't go. thanks"}
{"text":"I really, really don't like this place. Once worked down the street from it. The fajita veggies were cold (like refrigerated cold). Everything is genuinely pretty flavorless, honestly. They give you more choices than chipotle does (including churros?) but i still wouldn't go there.   It also might be a front for some kind of criminal organization, because I've never witnessed more than 5 customers in there at a given time."}
{"text":"Their carnitas taste so fresh, I think they are almost as good as Chipotle. Great place to have downtown, glad to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, and talk about a staff that seemed to not have a clue on what was going on. Food is average, prices are at least $1 or more above the going rate at competitors establishments, chips are stale, and in the end after watching them struggle to turn my pile of soup into a burrito, they made me a second, which ended up in the same condition. Portions were meager, and what I received was a burrito folded flat like a middle eastern sandwich. Who makes burritos with basmati rice? What a bust. Spend a little less time on your decor and fancy pots n pans and focus in your food. Save your money and your time. Eat someplace else."}
{"text":"To be clear I don't like writing bad reviews, and this review is service based only. The food I've gotten has always been 4.5 stars and I tell everyone how tasty it is. However, the service I got today was horrific. I got my usual a bowl to go and asked for the fajitas. She yelled \"fajitas\" to someone behind her and told me they aren't ready yet. I said that was fine assuming once they were ready they'd be added, like they are elsewhere and proceeded with my other toppings. She started ringing me out, at which point they announced the fajitas were ready. She said ok and proceeded to package my food, bag it up, hand it to me, and turn away. At this point I didn't want to say anything as I'd clearly been dismissed. All with a rude and curt attitude. As much as I really like the food, and would rather give my money to them then Chipotle, I don't know how soon is return."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Underseasoned and NOTHING is fresh.  I had the grilled chicken burrito bowl initially with hot salsa.  The salsa was spicy but it tasted bitter.  So I took it back up to the counter and they re-made it with the tomatillo salsa.  Better, but still not great and definitely not worth $7.50, especially when the salsas aren't made fresh (pathetic).  Food was barely warm, too, which is a huge pet peeve of mine.  Boyfriend got 3 hard shell tacos...they looked like El Paso taco shells.  WAY overpriced for what it is.  And my burrito \"bowl\" didn't take up half the bowl.  The young dude working there was clueless and timid and didn't know a thing about the menu.  If this place would take a lesson from Rubio's in California, it's this:  Grill the chicken fresh.  You *might* differentiate yourself from Chipotle and justify your ridiculous prices.  Otherwise, your food quality is cafeteria style and nothing great.  Skip this place.  A bad sign about this place?  Open until 3am.  Way to roll out the red carpet for all the drunks..."}
{"text":"As my friend Matt put it: \"El Guero: never a good night\"...however, they're one of the very few places open late on Friday and Saturday so that I can get some food after coming back from bars!  I've been here twice - the first time was daytime, and I got a burrito. Despite the Chipotle-style burrito making, I was not impressed. At all. It's sad when I'd rather go to a big name chain, but I would in a heartbeat. I had sworn them off until....  Flash forward a few months. It's late, late, late at night after a great time out on E 4th. Despite Matt's comments, we ordered a ton of nachos and salsas and gorged ourselves on the food. And you know what? It tasted pretty darn good! Were they the best nachos ever? Nope. Were they the best nachos available in the Warehouse district at 2am? Absolutely.  Honestly....this is probably a 2-star place that gets an extra star solely because it serves food so late (hint, hint other restaurants!). But good enough for me. At 2am."}
{"text":"we shared the burrito and burrito bowl. both were delicious!! service was great as well. the interior is incredibly nice. i'll definitely be back for future lunches and dinners."}
{"text":"It's open late. It's on West 9th. It's semi-healthy (depending on what you get), which is good because you most likely drank your weight in alcohol. Or at least felt like it.  I've been here when intoxicated, and it just seemed like a Chipotle for me. I was thankful for the brown rice, and the other unique options they seemed to have. I stuck to what I was used to, a veggie burrito bowl. It tasted fine, nothing really that blew me out of the water and nothing that disappointed me either.   I'll be back (sober) to try it and give a proper review. Three stars for now."}
{"text":"FRESH, FRESH, FRESH AND MANY CHOICES!!!! Finally we have a place to eat Downtown Cleveland that isnt a restaurant. They are actually open past 2pm and open on the weekends, LATE!   I drive from E12th to W9th byweekly to get lunch here. I dont have a problem with parking on the street to run in and grab my food to go or sit  inside.  I try something different every time im there since there are so many choices.  The line is quick and the staff is super friendly, greeting when i walked in and when i left. The salsa is very fresh and you can tell its not loaded down with perservatives. Guacamole is pretty darn good too. They have fresh cut veggies for your salad bowl rather than just the salsas and fajita veggies. The beans look like beans and not like slop! They also have your choice of lettuce. Healthy eating is hard to come by unless your packing your lunch. Chances are your not going to fall in love with everything you eat no matter where you go but there is definately something for you here."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped by for dinner tonight.  Pretty solid place.    Pros: Price point is fair ($7.50 for a huge burrito) I had the Chicken Burrito, with Bacon Onion Rice, pico, hot salsa, black beans, cheese, lettuce, grilled veggies and sour cream.  The Beans could have used a little more flavor, but were good. I ended up adding some green tobasco, which went well.  My wife had a salad with pinto beans, pork, pico, mild sauce, grilled veggies, cheese sour cream.  She liked it, and there was a lot left over as it was huge as well.  We will probably go back."}
{"text":"After my horrible experience here, i decided to send a email to the company and tell them about my experience.  One of the owners responded to me via a phone call.  We discussed my whole experience in detail and what he was going to do to improved the overall customer experience.  The owner even sent me a gift card, so that I would return and see the changes that were made.  I have been back since and the experience has improved.  The staff is more friendly then before.  I will go back again."}
{"text":"There are so many better options for mexican food in Cleveland.    The food was pretty flavorless, except the hot salsa which was fairly hot, but shockingly  salty.   I thought the bacon/rice was actually a pretty good idea, and it wasn't half bad.   The food wasn't terrible, but I was hoping for something great.   The staff was disinterested, and not even a little friendly or helpful.   I won't be back.   Like so many other reviewers said, I will be going to Ohio City Burrito, or Orale next time."}
{"text":"Whoohoo - Open until 3am on Friday's and Saturday's, and serve beer!  Fast Casual food in the Warehouse District just got a new friend in town, and it's not bad!  This venue, similar to the Chipotle/Qdoba that we know and love, has brought a fresh take to the burrito world.  They offer bowls, taco's, salads, and burritos with a healthier take on ingredients, including brown rice option!   We were all very pleased with our meals, and portion size - whoa!  The bowls are hefty and can easily serve two meals.  But, why save half for after the bars - it's still open. Go get a fresh bowl w/ corn chips and share friends into the morning hours.    Two other exciting tidbits:       1) Homemade sweet potato chips - a weakness of mine      2) They are going to have an outdoor patio in the warmer months - going to be a great spot!"}
{"text":"Chipotle fans will feel at home with the familiar menu and layout.  And those familiar with the Steelyard Chipotle will be pleased to see that the line doesn't take 40 minutes and the employees are friendly.  Brown rice on the menu is a nice option.  I had the burrito bowl with chicken.  Just what I wanted.  Ample seating.  Rice cooking could use a little improvement as it seems overcooked, but I'm sure that will come with time.  Nice to have El Guero in the warehouse district."}
{"text":"Great addition to the warehouse district. Fast, friendly service with good food. The option of brown rice was a pleasant surprise and the hot salsa is actually HOT! Can't wait to grab one again after the bars close!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. The food was ok, but nothing special. There will be no great draw to go there again. I would take Ohio city burrito over this in a heartbeat, or even Chipotle, as the burritos are priced better. I would likely try another restaurant in the area if i need to eat around their again or eat somewhere i already enjoy like nauti mermaid or little bar"}
{"text":"This place is NOT like chipotle.  No matter what combination you choose it tastes like absolutely nothing.  Just eat sawdust, it's cheaper and will probably taste the same.  Not only is the food crappy, it's expensive for what you get AND the employees are super crabby.  My dad got a bowl with double chicken and the girl charged him for TWO whole bowls.  Skip this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh god- this place is terrible! I'm late to review this, but tried it out when it first opened.  Living in the neighborhood, I was so excited to finally be getting a local mexican place and then so quickly and swiftly disappointed.    Everything here is bland, bland, bland.  I'm not even sure how they managed to accomplish that.  I went with 2 friends, we had 2 burritos, a salad, and chips. This review goes for all of it equally. The food is totally flavorless, and somewhat overpriced for what it is.    So, as another reviewer has mentioned do not think Chipotle..because this place is so much worse. If you are craving a good burrito and are in the area, please save your dollars and head to Ohio City Burrito instead. You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"For ye non Spanish speaking Yelpers, Guero is a derogatory term for light skinned people with light colored hair.    I got a veggie burrito with brown rice, black beans, vegetables, pico, corn and hot salsas, lettuce and guacamole.  With all those ingredients,  I was taken back by how small it was, and ended up needing to eat my friends leftovers to get full. When you are used to seeing Chipotle and Qdoba give you large portions of ingredients, you feel ripped off when you pay more money for a smaller burrito.  Their staff is new. They really had no idea how to operate a burrito line.  To El Ginger's credit, with time and experience, that should get better.  But where was the wrap training? My burrito fell apart in my hands, which made it super frustrating to eat.  Another thing I didn't like: they serve their hot sauce in little packets like Taco Bell which are difficult to open with the lost dexterity that comes with a night of drinking and messy hands from a broken burrito.  Where were the jars of Tobasco and Cholula? Maybe they pulled those from the shelves for fear of theft; I did decide to try it at 2:30am.    On the plus side, it's nice to have a healthy Mexican option downtown where you can build your own burrito to healthy or non-healthy liking.  I'm sure beers and friends will  likely convince me to go there again... I just hope for a bigger burrito that stays together when I do."}
{"text":"Well well well....... So we have a Mexican joint in the Warehouse District.  Lets start by saying do not, I repeat do not think Chipotle.  The reason I say this is because this place blows Chipotle out of the water!   I know what your saying, But Marques how can this be better and I've never even heard of of it?  I asked myself the same question moments after finishing my burrito bowl.  To put it simply, this place is good!  The brown rice is a good start (they also offer white and another type with bacon added.  The chicken was fresh and flavor full and lacked the overwhelming salt punch you get from Chipotle.  The fajitas are grilled to perfection and the salsa had just the right amount of kick to add some punch to the meal without muting the rest of the flavors.   Now for the kicker.  They are open until 3am on weekend! No longer do the residents of the Warehouse District have to go to bed hungry after a night out because they refuse to fight through the mosh pit that is Paninis after 2am for a slice of pizza.  This isn't to say they aren't busy as well once last calls been made.  But things are a little more organized with the bank style zig zag line keeping the hungry masses all in a neat line. All said in done this is a much needed addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"El Guero gets a \"C-\".     What I ordered:  Burrito Bowl, brown rice, black beans, corn, hot salsa, lettuce, guacamole, fresh sliced peppers   Lets talk about  the bad--  Black Beans-- unseasoned, tasted like they opened a can and microwaved them  Corn- blech! again can opener working over time, they could have at least rinsed it off or squeezed a lemon or lime to give it some zest!  If you like hot salsa, I repeat if you like HOT SALSA... run, run  far away from this place.  It was the worst excuse for salsa I have ever tasted!  It was like a can of tomato paste was aborted in to a spice rack.  Not everything needs to be gourmet, but at least  try!  (it was like \"kissin' yer sister\" ) I ended up scraping it off, or like they do in that Lonely Island song \"I throw it on the ground!\"  Also I got take out and wasn't even offered a plastic fork.    The Good- and this is what gives me hope for their future  the brown rice was cooked perfectly, great texture, not mushy or undercooked.    The peppers were fresh & crisp same for the lettuce, it was refreshing     the Guacamole was good, I won't say it's best I've ever had, it is definitely a shining point that will have me coming back.  (plus i need to try their corn chips)   The place had a good vibe everyone was friendly, it sure beat going to the Steelyard Chipotle, that place is maddening!    I am sure in the coming months El Guero will see it's fare share of improvements as it matures, but until then I'll trek the extra mile to Ohio City Burrito for my lunch time taco fix."}
{"text":"better than currito burrito in the cleveland airport, but still not as good as chipotle."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken taco, with lettuce,pico,corn,sour cream and cheese. the chicken was tasty and smokey. The fllour shell was really flimsy so my taco kind of fell apart. the prices are a bit high, 7.50 for 3 tacos no bueno."}
{"text":"Not good not good not good not good.  Oh god, guys, I don't know where to start with El Guero. First of all, never get corn on anything you order cause that stuff comes straight out of a can. It's not even tasteless, it is actively bad, and this is corn we're talking about. I almost felt like I was being personally attacked.  Secondly, the hot salsa is HOLY CRAP SO SALTY. I am not one to complain about the saltiness of food but I had trouble eating my bowl because of how salty it was. I'm sure that other ingredients contributed to the overall salinity of my meal. To add to this, the beans have absolutely no flavor.  I have admittedly only had one experience with El Guero and I may chance returning to try a different set of ingredients, but I was pretty disappointed by a few things that are not hard to get right.  The portions were acceptable for the price, and the service was alright, but I will give this place maybe one more try before it's gone from my life forever. What I can definitely say is that if you're craving a fast Mexican lunch, go to Ohio City Burrito if you have the time. Otherwise, support a brand new restaurant and enjoy Charkha's awesome Indian lunch buffet right down the street.  El Guero is not worth your time or money. Avoid wherever possible."}
{"text":"You're familiar with Chipolte, right? Ok so now we have that covered, each restaurant that tries to be Chipolte will be compared to Chipolte.  El Guero is not bad by any means.  Skip the Burrito Bowl (my Chipolte fave) and stick to the actual burrito.  There is a lack of creativity to set it apart from other restaurants with the same business model.  It's good, but it's all been done before.  Guacamole on the side with chips was average.    Best of all however, it's right downtown within walking distance of my apartment.  It's a little more expensive than Chipolte but that's the downtown premium.    I'd give any Chipolte a 4 for their food, and this place is a notch below.  Earns a respectable 3 star rating."}
{"text":"It's next door to Constantinos. What does this mean? It means that whenever Constantino's prepared food section is lacking for our last minute dinner, we resort to this place.   It's not that it's horrible. It's clean. The staff is friendly enough. The food is just \"meh\". Ohio City Burrito is much better. I will admit that it has a \"fresher\" taste than Chipotle though.   Either way, that's what you can expect. The same concept as Chipotle - with more varieties of rice. ;)"}
