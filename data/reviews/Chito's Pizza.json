{"text":"The pizza looked old when i walked in. Maybe it's better to order it fresh... I got the chicken schwarma which came with some wilting veggies and layers of sauce. It... Tastes as if the sauce is compensating for the lack of flavour in the chicken. Yes it is cheap and probably a staple. You're not coming here for top shelf food. It's the draw of schwarma on pizza...

{"text":"Chito's claims they have just about everything in one tiny restaurant that, as far as I saw, has no seating.  The pizza at the end of the day was curled up and dry - nothing was fresh, but I was starving.

The only thing that made my slice better was by first seeing a woman get a slice with chicken on the top.  They carved fresh chicken from the spit and loaded it on top - added garlic and hot sauces, then popped it in a bag.

It was great to have late-night, and the service is pretty good - but all in all, the food is tired, dry, and dirty."}
{"text":"The owners of Chito's Pizza deserve to be busy: their product is unreal. The pizza can't be beat, the service from the family members themselves is hospitable (other staff members just seem to be unsure of themselves). They were too kind when they learned we had just moved to the neighbourhood and it was our first time. They gave us a fair price on our two HUGE XL pizzas. When one of the pizzas came out with pepperoni instead of peppers (a miscommunication on their end), they said they'd take care of us next time we came in. A couple days later I returned to buy a falafel and though another staff member was helping me originally, the owner stepped in and took care of wrapping it herself and not charging me. I felt bad - this is how much value there food has - I felt like I received SO MUCH and gave them SO LITTLE. She refused my money so I put it in the tip jar. TIPS FOR CHITO'S AND BEWARE: advertises free delivery but they no longer do it and am guessing they don't care enough/have the money to spend on printing new flyers and signage. Whatever, they put out an AMAZING pizza, will totally let this slide. The garlic sauce is awesome, ask for extra on the side. And lastly: stick to the pizza. Everything else is super mediocre (but cheap!). LASTLY for real this time, be sure to get a shawarma pizza. Ask for: green peppers, spicy onions & chicken (they are very generous with the amount and put Pizza Pizza to utter shame). #TwoEntrepreneursApproved"}

If the pizza slices are freshly out of the oven , then this combination is even more enjoyable. The pricing is amazingly cheap with really good fast service ."}
{"text":"Chito's Pizza is a hot closet on Bloor where everything is weird and notable. Spanish namesake, serving Italian pizza, topped with middle eastern shawarma, owned and run by Albanians. This place should be given some kind of CHIN Picnic Toronto Diversity Award.

The chicken-piled slice of pizza plus a pop costs $3.50, no tax. I haven't crunched the numbers, but I'm pretty sure it's a tremendous calorie and protein-to-dollar ratio, so I advise every homeless person to eat there. If you're not homeless, it feels like you're getting away with something at these prices. Maybe bring an extra dollar for a tip, or perhaps a fan to cool off the face of the whoever is making your crazy shawarma pizza while standing over an open pizza oven in August.

ONE STAR REMOVED for the promise of FREE DELIVERY on their signage and flyers that doesn't actually exist."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious. I am sure they use fresh worked-up dough, which feels pleasant to chew on.  Toppings are fresh and plentiful.  I don't usually enjoy pizza, but ended up finishing a lot. 

Shawarma is excellent.  My 9 year old can't stop eating.  He also gave big thumbs to the chicken wings.  

I recommend their signature garlic sauce.  Worth trying!

Fresh and hearty food.  Easy environment.  Cost is minimal.

Top 5 mom n pop shops in T.O."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like shawarma/doner or pizza? This place combines both of them for a decent price.  The food is always good and fresh from my experience and they are generous with the toppings.  I found that the food at this location is much better than the Dufferin location."}
{"text":"The best delicious, cheap, unhealthy food in Bloordale. Love this place! 

Looking at Chitos from the outside, it looks ghetto to be honest. But if you stood outside long enough, you'll notice enough people coming in and out to think, 'This place must be good, I should try it.' Thankfully, I skipped this process as I heard about how good Chitos was from my boyfriend who has been going there for the last 8-10 years (since highschool). 

I've always ordered the small chicken plate (it's not as small as you think). It comes with rice and chicken and lots of sauce (you should get extra hot sauce). Its only $5. If you want extra chicken, you can get it for another $1-2. This is so filling, and I workout quite often so my appetite is not small. 

I've also had the pizza with chicken on top. I think it was only $2. The idea is that you can order any slice (I would only get it if there was fresh pizza available) and you can get chicken on top. It's messy so I wouldn't recommend you to walk and eat it. It's also best eaten right away because it's hot. 

I'm drooling thinking about this place... I live in the area so it's a great place to go when I'm too lazy to cook or you've got midnight munchies.

The nice thing about Chitos is that you can order inside or from the outside window making this place accessible to all people! Dog walkers don't need to tie up their dog, peoples with disabilities don't need to climb the steps (sometimes they can't!) and parents with kids don't need to roll their stroller in this already cramped and probably hot area inside."}
{"text":"Drunk nights that end up here are always good ones. Fresh, fresh pizza. And they LOVE to pile it with stuff. You can get gyro or fresh cut chicken on your pizza slice for something like .75 cents and they put a STACK of it and then they'll almost always ask if you want sauce on it and that means a ton of this amazing Caesar creamy dressing. It's just delicious. But for when you're feeling gluttonous otherwise you might judge them and never look back. Ha"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about. Came here to try the famous pizza topped with shawarma and it was nothing special. Really disappointed in the quality of the food. Even the pizzas alone are bland and so thin, you can hardly taste the pizza. Gave it a 3 stars because the chef was really nice about allergies. Asked him about one and he went to the back and brought out the entire heavy flour bag to show us the ingredients list."}
{"text":"This place is shit there staff are shit there pizza is some of the worst pizza and there garlic sauce tastes like ASS"}
{"text":"Dirty, dirty pizza. If you are looking to feel ill, than this is the pizza joint for you.  You might as well just drop your slice of pizza into the toilet. I thought that the idea of chicken shwarma topped on my slice would be a nice addition to my pizza.... I was clearly mistaken. The grisly chicken tasted as if Chito's had placed a collection bin outside of KFC and collected all of the left over nasty bits from random parts like chicken feet and beaks.  They then slathered the chicken with a gnarly garlic sauce that made my stomach turn just to look at it. However, I had the munchies and I am just pig enough to eat it.  
If you are desperate for discounted dirty food and indigestion, than Chito's is the joint for you."}
{"text":"Delicious puffy crust and delicious shawarma pizza... Amazing value! Medium shawarma pizza $11 flat rate. So filling like 1-2 slices is all I can handle! This is not for the faint hearted lol definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Dirty, the person behind the counter handles the money and touch's the food.

Bad costumer services, the debit machine doesn't work, and forces you to the atm next door (extra $3) to pay.

Rude employee, calls the costumer cheap for not wanting to pay a $3 fee for the atm. (You should warn the costumer that the machine is not working before he orders)

The pizza it self was alright, but after seeing how dirty, and how rude the employee is. I will never come again."}
{"text":"Just OK, based on only one visit. 

Stumbled across this place on the way home from Yorkdale, decided to check it out.

When I asked the teenage girl staffer for a recommendation, she laughed and said not the pizza, go for the chicken shawarma, which I did, and it was decent, but not mind-blowing.

Maybe I'm a bit spoiled having hit most of the good spots in the Wexford zone of Scarborough and down by the Danforth, but Chito's didn't blow me away, it was okay for a quick bite when in the neighborhood.

The basic building blocks of the pizza slices on display looked quite weak and like they've been sitting around for a while, but the idea of a chicken shawarma pizza with lots of garlic sauce doesn't sound terrible, so I may be back sometime."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Chito's!

I live just around the corner from this place and it has served me very well! 

If you're short on money and want something filling - go to Chito's. 

If you're in the area and want something cheap and cheerful - go to Chito's

If you want a riduculous amount of food that you are going to eat straight away, go to Chito's.

I tend to stay away from the pizza here though. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid pizza. But the chicken shwarma is where it's at. A big bite of food for under 5 books. Can't go wrong.

My one word of advise is that if you order the pizza with chicken on it, you better eat that bad boy the same night because when I opened up the fridge the day after a particularly heavy night's drinking, the leftover chicken had gone rock solid. Not good in the microwave! It's the chicken on a skewer thing that they use for their kebabs and what not. 

Chito's chicken wrap - do it!"}
{"text":"A slice of pizza heaped with chicken shawarma and strong creamy garlic sauce... and a pop for $3.50. Awesome value, and tasty! I've had better pizza elsewhere, but you can't beat the value offered!"}

{"text":"I likely wouldn't stop by Chito's if I was just walking by but since I live just down Lansdowne, Chito's has become a go-to for a quick bite to eat. 

The spot is probably best well-known for its chicken shawarma meat on a slice of pizza. Pretty standard food (pizza, shawarma) so there's really not much that can go wrong. 

For what it is, cheap prices and quick service, four stars."}
{"text":"When you can put two of my favourite foods together, I am sold! And yes I'm taking about the heaps of schwarma chicken on top of a slice of pizza heaven. Note- this is not for everyone, and is extremely messy. But for $2.50 a slice, it's worth a try!"}

Large chicken shawarma plate for $6.50, no I'm not even kidding in the slightest. Serious face, $6.50 and boy was it filled! Tons of rice, chicken, pickled turnips, cucumbers, lettuce tomatoes, red onions and sauces. Stuffed! Phenomenal value. 

The area is a bit sketchy so best keep your eyes open when taking a stroll on these streets, otherwise a great find. We'll be back to try the pizza shawarma."}

People, the questionable slice of za that transports your generous portion of  chicken shawarma, garlic & hot sauce is just the vessel. Given your late night Blandsdowne options you should be singing Chito's name from the rooftops. And all for $2.50? Cman. Never mind the noises from your stomach, it's just trying to give you a high five and say \"Hey bro, well done.\"

5 enthusiastic stars."}
{"text":"Wow this is one of the best pizza I have ever had. So much flavor! The slices are so big, so much meat. I love the barbecue sauce on top! This guy is not cheap with the meat. It's a very small place, could barely squeeze in there but the pizza is amazing and cheap."}
{"text":"Kinda dirty but cheap. 

Have been looking for a shawarma/pizza place since Albion's at Dufferin and Bloor closed down. This wasn't it unfortunately.

Where Albion's had spotless food prep area, friendly service, pride in their food, fresh and interesting salads and pickles, crispy chicken, fresh pizza, and a clean seating area, this place has none of those things.

Instead, you get thrown together generic salads, mystery chicken, congealed pizza and a pretty dirty seating and food prep area. 

It is cheap though, six bucks all in for a med chicken plate, and it's salty and tasty enough in a pinch but I'll be continuing my search elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my 100th review of the year could be somewhere memorable. Even if it wasn't something I'd likely ever come back to.

I saw all the 5 star reviews of the Chicken Shawarma Pizza, and decided that a perfect start to the weekend usually involves a little gluttony and I got on board.
Pricing wise, it's $10 for a medium, $13 for large, $15 for XL. This is just the chicken, sauce and cheese included. Any additional toppings were $1.

After ordering from their tiny storefront, I was told to come back in 15 minutes. AKA, this place is too small to have people milling about while waiting, so don't bother hanging around. After coming back, the pizza was made but it wasn't until my return that they actually put the chicken and shawarma sauce on the pizza. The problem is that since the cheese is already setting, the chicken isn't actually being absorbed, it's just sitting on top. As soon as you try to pick up a slice all the chicken falls off the top. This created one messy eating task, and I couldn't imagine actually eating this front of someone.

Flavour wise? The pizza wasn't anything great, and the added shawarma sauce is over the top in terms of saltiness and garlic content. Literally overwhelmed the sauce and cheese flavours. There were times during eating this thing that my review went anywhere from 2 to 4 stars. The best part? Grabbing a fork and eating all the saucy chicken that had fallen off the pizza.

In the end, I'll admit it was pretty cheap and food coma inducing. But that doesn't mean I'm planning on coming back to do it again."}
{"text":"Chito's always seems to be busy and I honestly just can't fathom why.  Are they crazy inexpensive? Na, not really.  I mean, they're cheap, sure, but not in a good way.

I went in hoping for a slice of pizza and quickly changed my mind upon viewing the dry, old slices on offer.  I instead opted for a falafel, seeing as they're seemingly more a shawarma/falafel joint anyway.

The falafel was dry, lacked flavour, and was overly greasy.  Hm.  Not good.  The pita shell seemed stale.  Also not good.  The toppings were sparse and bland.  Triple fail.

It was cheap, but even cheap doesn't justify bad.  I won't be back, especially considering we've got Curry in a Hurry, Ali Baba's, and Vena's all within a stone's throw distance despite being in another stratosphere of quality."}
{"text":"A slice of any pizza topped with a glutinous proportion of chicken, garlic sauce and hot sauce for $2.50?? Listen, these 3 star reviewers can't matter; I mean, TWO FIFTY??!! You tell me, where else ur gonna find that?!  If you don't want the stupid dried up slices, order a fresh medium shawarma pizza, it's only $11!  So what if the place is small?? Take it the fudge home, or sit on a bench by Lansdowne Station and enjoy the ambient sounds of belligerent coffee time crackhead/enthusiasts.   I'm kinda surprised that people complained so muchabout the slices being old when pizza pizza is up the street selling mummified slices and panzerottis. Don't let these caviar palate-having reviewers sway you to miss out on that mind-blowing shawarma slice; Chitos is awesome.  5 stars!!!!!!"}

{"text":"The food here is always fresh. Chicken is tender and juicy. The chicken shawarma pizza is a must try."}
{"text":"I wondered what made this spot so popular the past few years, busy, lots of quick bites.  Used to be a Wing Machine (drunken food). The place is tight/crammed, it's hot.  The popular item is a slice with minced chicken on top w a heavy sauce.  I was pretty weary, doesn't appear very clean/sanitary.  I thought the pizza was decent/mediocre, the chicken/sauce was 'too much' (being polite), scrapped it off and had the slice.  A one time experience for me."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Have been here for years and will always come back. The price is unbeatable, their sauce is amazing and the chicken is always fresh. This is a spot if you want a pizza sharwma at its best"}
{"text":"As some of the other reviewers have already said, Chito's is nowhere near your fine dining experience, but don't let the appearance scare you off... the food here is pretty good.  Just a few steps from the Lansdowne TTC station, Chito's is a great place to pop in and grab a quick bite to eat. 

I wouldn't recommend coming here for sit down, because (1) there's not much seating to begin with - only stools that face the back/side wall, and (2) you probably want to get in and out as fast as possible to avoid absorbing too many calories from the airborne grease.  Although they're known for their pizza, I only ever tried the chicken wraps.  For $4 (no tax), you get a decent sized chicken wrap with meat straight off the spit.  

The best part, they have LOTS of toppings (more than 10 if I recall correctly) plus the delicious garlic and hot sauce.  Don't forget to get extra napkins because these things are a challenge to eat, especially if ordered fully loaded."}
{"text":"slices of pizza with heaping amounts of shawarma chicken, garlic sauce and hot sauce?? for $2.50?? What's not to like??

Super fun place to bring people on dates. Appearances are lacking but more than made up for by the taste. Don't expect to be able to eat inside, the physical space is tiny as hell."}
{"text":"When was the last time you looked deep into your soul, beneath the layers of half-truths and self-delusion, and faced the darkness that lies inside us all?

Let me rephrase that: Have you ever been to Chito's Pizza?

I discovered the hallowed grounds of Chito's this past Friday night as I walked home across Bloor Street. I was hungry and tired, but all of the fast food options along the way were mediocre at best. Pizza Pizza. Subway. 241. I needed something more. Something pure.

Just as I was ready to give up and go home, I saw Chito's. I had walked past this place over a hundred times before, but had never been inside. This time was different, and now nothing will ever be the same.

When was the last time you hurt someone you loved? It's okay. We all do things we know we shouldn't. Like when the friendly server behind the counter asked me if I wanted chicken shwarma dumped on top of my slice of pizza, and I couldn't help myself.

I said yes.

Hot sauce?

... Yes.

Garlic sauce?

Y E S.

Do you have two dollars and fifty cents?

...

$2.50. For a slice of pizza covered in chicken shwarma and drowning in garlic and hot sauce. How?! How did the stars align just so?? Chito must be a lunatic or a prophet, or both. There's a part of me that wants to meet him, but there's also a part of me that wants to drive my car full speed down the highway without ever taking my foot off the gas, just to see what happens.

Look at the pictures. WHAT IS THAT? Is that pizza?

No, it's not pizza. It's freedom.

Not the bullshit, commercialized faux-freedom you see in TV and movies. This isn't a two week Caribbean cruise or mindfulness meditation retreat. This isn't your pampered climb of Everest - do you see any fucking sherpas here? No, this is true freedom, where the weight of every decision you make has the potential to crush you.

Eating your first slice at Chitos is like having your partner suddenly slide a finger you-know-where mid-coitus, and then the dog licks your toes as you climax. You didn't necessarily want it to happen, and you certainly didn't expect it to feel so good, but now that you've had it you need it again. Every damn time, or it's just not the same.

Yes, the shwarma and sauce are spilling off the pizza before you even try and pick it up. And yes, when you do try and eat it, the toppings will cascade over your fingers and onto your lap. Your hands and face will be covered in more sauce than were on the pizza to begin with. HOW?? 

Did you honestly think this cost only $2.50? No, you cannot experience Chito's without paying a higher price. I've been back at least once a day since Friday, and I still need more. Something is wrong with me - something that can't be fixed. All I can do is go back again, and again, and again...

Because Chito's Pizza is one of the greatest things I have ever taste-- no, EXPERIENCED. The things I used to enjoy before Chito's? I don't remember what they were. My friends, family... they're all gone now. I'm finally free, but I no longer know who I am.

Chito's Pizza isn't a metaphor for life, life is a metaphor for Chito's Pizza.

Maybe this isn't for you. At least, not yet. But there will come a time when you feel the darkness stirring, deep inside you. A longing like you've never felt before. To tell your boss and colleagues to fuck themselves. To tell the love of your life that you need to be alone for a while, and you might never come back. To tell your kids that they aren't really your kids.

Yes, there will inevitably be a time that you will be called to Chito's Pizza. Whether you answer that call - whether you choose to embrace the agony of existence and let the salty, greasy taste of freedom obliterate you and everything you've ever believed in - that is entirely up to you."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the one outside Landsdowne station often when I was in highschool. There was just something about an amazing shawarma at a low price with pineapples in it that had my heart swooning! Yesterday I had the chance to visit it's new location near Yorkdale to try out the pizza shawarma ($12.99) medium and my expectations were met! If you love pizza and shawarma you've got try this yourself. Make sure to add hot sauce and banana peppers for the extra kick.

Service was also top notch, the lady and gentleman who tended to us behind the counter were very welcoming and sweet. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Bought Shawarma pizza, large at $14.50.
Pizza itself was mediocre (crust) and cheese was non-existent.
It is called Shawarma because the pizza will be topped with diced-up chicken, garlic & hot sauce.

Présentation/handling non-existent.

Passable if you are hungry.
I just did not feel/think that the owners/servers have pride in making the pizza.
The whole operation looked to me as if the people/owners/servers who were there
were \" playing house. \"

Very basic equipments/condiments/knowledge of making pizza.

It is just an honest way of making a living.
At least they take credit cards.

Customer service was basic.
Taste was \"cardboardy\" with cut-up chicken that did not taste coming from a vertical spit rod.  

The Chito's on Dufferin Ave appears to be a bit \"serious/professional\" looking.
I ordered the same thing and it was cheaper and had more \"substance\" on the pizza.

Their prices have changed.
Really.   Not cheap.   
Quite \"expensive\" for something un-palatable and ?-able ingredients."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to Chito's for awhile after hearing about it a few years ago I finally went. It's shawarma on pizza - what could go wrong? Unfortunately, it was a HUGE disappointment - the garlic sauce was neither garlicky or saucy, it was super salty, and the hot sauce was nothing special. The chicken shawarma itself was dry and chopped up to minced proportions. Overall, I'm in shock that they could mess up shawarma!

Pros:
- Cheap - $2.50 for shawarma pizza slice

Cons:
- The garlic sauce was too salty and didn't taste like garlic
- The chicken shawarma was dry and chopped up weird

Note: One of my friends said it was amazing, and a second friend's second slice looked a little better. Maybe it's hit or miss, but I wouldn't give it a second chance even if it only cost me $2.50."}
{"text":"Pizza was bland. 
Stingy on the chicken. 
I went on like the first week it opened.
Two slices of shawarma pizza came up to $13?!??!
The lansdowne location is like less than $3 a slice with a generous portion of chicken."}
{"text":"I have gone to this Chito's Pizza over 150 times (I know because I checked my credit card / debit card bills). I go back occasionally now as this was my go-to spot for shawarma 4-8 years ago when I used to be in the area. 

I recommend the $5.00 chicken plate (if you are a high-school student you get a free pop) and the $4.50 pizza with chicken on it (add pineapple ontop of the chicken, it really cuts the grease).

You know a place is a true \"hole in the wall\" when:
a) the items are called for by its price (i.e. $3 chicken plate, $5 chicken plate, $7 chicken plate);
b) the actual width of the store is no more than 2 meters;
c) they make sales on 'credit' / guarantees that the customer will pay the next time they come in;
d) there is no parking for it - every time I come here I park illegally on the street for a few moments.

The place took a real quality dive when it comes to its food, which is reasonable as they never changed their prices for 8 years. Their sauce is no longer as tasty and their portions are slightly smaller - but for the price, this really can't be beat. This is why I gave it a 4-star review; the quality of the food itself is probably a 2-star to a 3-star, but for how much you are paying, can you really complain?

There used to be a better shawarma shop that was equidistant from Dufferin St. on Bloor St. as well, but in the opposite direction. I think that they closed down because they were probably not turnomg a profit, 1.5x the price and 2.0x the quality of Chito's for $0.50 more doesn't seem like a sustainable business model.

I would caution you from becoming addicted to this place - it is definitely bad for your body. When I ate here everyday for months on end, I gained at least 15 pounds and started getting acne (every time I stopped eating here, I stopped getting acne)."}
{"text":"Found a random post on the gram, same day we went to check this place out. Small shop. Initial thought of the store was questionable. Not really the most organized and the yellow pass sign wasn't pleasing to look at. Not much room to dine in, but on the bright side they had a take out window. Pricing was surprisingly low, from the slices, pizzas, to wings. 

Ordered a large pizza, half veggie and half with just shawarma chicken. Drizzled with garlic and hot sauce at the end. Came to $14.00. 

Despite my initial reaction the food was top notch, the entire pizza was done in a matter of minutes. Perfect crust that doesn't scrape your gums. Generous amount of toppings on both sides.Good cheese. The chicken was as expected well flavored and was great alone. Adding the sauces on top, was the perfect combination. 

Overall would recommend this place, and worth a try. One of those cases where you shouldn't judge by looks. Great experience for a random plan. Friendly staff. More importantly for the price the food is good. Would go again.

** Dont forget to ask for the garlic sauce and hot sauce on top."}
{"text":"Let's start off with saying that this place is incredibly small. However, don't let that stop you from visiting this place because this place has some of the most delicious pizza.

The chicken shawarma pizza is absolutely amazing here, from the dough to the toppings to the garlic and hot sauce, this is one amazing pizzeria. It is however, very heavy so unless you're ok with feeling sluggish and incrediblely full or you have with you a decent amount of friends, I suggest getting a small."}

They put together both kinds of foods into a delicious combination called the Chito's Signature Pizza which is basically a pizza topped with chicken shawarma and all of the sauces that usually come with it! 

You get to pick one topping with the chito signature pizza so we got pepperoni, it was baked and then topped with chicken sharwarma... perfection yumm!"}

I couldn't find this delicacy anywhere on the menu, but upon request the man behind the counter took a slice of pepperoni and topped it with delicious chicken and garlic sauce... Amazing!
I likely wouldn't have eaten this pizza if it wasn't slathered in chicken and garlicy goodness - it was a bit dry-looking before being 'dressed' - but does any other place offer something like this?? 
Good job, Chito. Good job."}

I actually went for a pizza slice, however they did not look fresh so I opted for a shawarma. It was tasty. I have had some bad shawarma's in Toronto and have been put off by  them for a while. Not anymore. I found my spot.

I had a can of coke with the shawarma, too. Total cost. 5$."}
{"text":"I popped in there for a slice of pizza with chicken as many have recommended here.  It was AWSOME!!! And $2.50??? Wow... I'll be going back there quite often I'm thinking!!!  The pizza doesn't look all that great but the taste is amazing... And with the chicken on top with garlic sauce... Yeah AMAZING!! Did I mention it was only  $2.50????"}
{"text":"Large pizza with 1 topping, with 2 cans of pop, $11.99.

Shawarma pizza, large, $15.99.

Both were good!"}
{"text":"Home of the chicken shawarma pizza. What's a chicken shawarma pizza? chicken shawarma on pizza of course..don't forget to ask for garlic and hot sauce on top."}
{"text":"I got the shwarma plate with rice, size medium was $6 including tax and was enough for me to eat twice.  Meal had a good proportion of both rice, meat and salad. Everything tasted great, but the garlic sauce (and I love garlic) was WAYYYY too garlicy and left my breath worse than anything I've ever eaten before. To get five stars they need a slightly less garlicy sauce option and tahini sauce because the garlic sauce is the only sauce aside from hot. The turnips are great but the cabbage is not pickled cabbage, which would be better. Overall, good food."}
{"text":"Chito's Pizza is probably best known as the former \"Pizza Best\" in the shady 'hood of Bloor/Lansdowne. I'm not sure if the owner is the same as it was when it was called Pizza Best but his name is indeed Chito. 

I remember ordering delivery from here a bunch of times when my brother lived in the area and a group of us would go to his place to watch Leafs games. The most memorable phone call (a story that my family is constantly asking me to repeat!) went a little something like this:

Me: \"Hey, do you guys have some sort of special, like two medium or large pizzas plus drinks for under $20?\"
Delivery Guy: \"No, we don't have anything like that, sorry.\"
Me: \"You don't have any party-sized specials?\"
Delivery Guy: \"The only thing I can offer you is two large pizzas with three toppings each, 15 chicken wings, four pops, cheesy fries and nachos for $15.\"

So ten times the food for 2/3 the price? Sold. Quick and reliable!"}
{"text":"My husband was verrrrry pleased to discover we are in Chito's delivery zone. He's a huge fan of all things cheap shawarma, and let's be honest, so am I. We got their chicken, rice and salad plate (extra sauce, duh) for dinner tonight and they were perfect. Our daughter isn't old enough for spicy so we ordered her a panzerotti to pick at. Who doesn't love a giant pizza pocket? Show me the man who doesn't love a giant pizza pocket!"}
