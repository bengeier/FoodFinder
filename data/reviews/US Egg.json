{"text":"Always Great Service & Great Food! Lovely Family run Business!!!! The Protein Pancakes are a must! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the menu is extensive. The chicken fried steak is delicious. They also serve mixed drinks like Bloody Mary's and Mimosas which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's by far my favourite breakfast or brunch destination! their Skillets are awesome mmm! definitely worth trying.  Service is very friendly and on the move."}
{"text":"We've been here several times. Food & Service are OUTSTANDING! The signage outside, & the name,      U.S. Egg; gives the appearance of a government surplus program. My husband insisted, so we gave it a try. I was shockingly surprised at how good it was (despite the meager, albeit very clean, furnishings & decor).  All the frills, class & quality are put into the Food (where it really counts)!!  We now drive the extra distance to come here more regularly. I wasn't a breakfast eater until I discovered the half & half. I love both the protein pancakes and the egg dishes I've tried. I don't understand why anybody would choose The Place over U.S. Egg .....except for longevity & reputation in the community. Prices & portions are comparable, but U.S. Egg is superior in quality!! I hope the word spreads & this little diamond located in the ruff catches on!!! We Love it!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning at 8 am with my hubby.  Greeted by everyone on the staff with smiles and headed back to be seated.  When they started to direct us to seats by the kitchen and I said \"not over there\", they happily seated us in a booth.  The service was excellent at that time in the morning.  The food was not so excellent.  I had the Denver omelet and my hubby had corned beef hash.  The breakfasts come with hash browns and a toasted, already buttered English muffin. However, the hash browns tasted like they were prepared in a large batch and kept in a warming pan until served.  They were not particularly tasty and lacked the flavorful crunchiness of freshly cooked potatoes.  The omelet was just okay, nothing special with crunchy green peppers and sauteed onions, diced ham inside.  There was a small amount of cheese on the top, but noticeably lacking inn the interior.  My hubby commented that  the corned beef has could have been more appealing, but enjoyed the fresh tomatoes served with the meal.  I don't know if it is the glass/plastic serving plates they used, but the food was cold before we were half way through it.  They might want to consider placing the hot food on plates that hold the heat a little bit better.  I have to agree with another reviewer regarding the coffee cup size and the coffee, but at least it was hot and the carafe left on the table was enough for the two of us.  The restaurant was filling rather quickly, but still no one waiting in line at 8:40 when we left.  Thumbs up for the service. Needs improvement for the food.  At $25 for the two meals and 2 cups of coffee, we probably will look for another place for better food."}
{"text":"My mother and I went to this new location to celebrate her birthday. We frequently eat at the location on Mill and Baseline to celebrate various holidays with family. i.e. birthdays, graduation, easter, etc. The location off of Mill is quite small so we were excited to see how open and modern this new location was designed.   Upon arrival, we were greeted cheerfully and seated right away. Our server was very friendly and chatty, but in a good way. She took our drink orders right away and brought us back out beverages and pitchers to refill our drinks as we please. We ordered pumpkin waffles and the california benedict. The pumpkin waffle was heaven on earth! I recommend opting for whipped cream with no syrup. You won't be disappointed! And as usual, the california benedict was amazing. It's eggs benedict with bacon, avocado and tomato... so flipping good. At the end of the meal, the server even offered to-go cups for drinks. I always think this is a nice gesture.  I will certainly be coming back to this location and would recommend giving it a shot."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places!! Love the protein pancakes!! I don't know the exact name of it, but my boyfriend gets the meat lovers skillet. He always asks to add chorizo and extra cilantro on it, it's by far his favorite breakfast dish! The wait to get in can suck, but in my opinion  it's a great breakfast place that's near my house! Also love the greyhounds and mimosa's!!!"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast place!!! Cold hash browns, not cooked eggs(how can someone messed up these?) bad service. Waited for half an hour for our food! This is our first and last in this stupid place!"}
{"text":"Loved my traditional cheeseburger with bacon! The fries were great and our server was very attentive and friendly. Overall love the good and atmosphere. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Our new go-to breakfast spot!  Pleasant, updated interior, excellent, attentive staff, great food and good prices. Menu has large selection and they will customize. We were all pleased with the promptness of receiving our meal, the flavor (love the french toast), good coffee (not bland diner-style coffee) and the surroundings of a clean, modern restaurant. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had the gentlemen jim omelette and the garden omelette and a full order of the protein pancakes.  Both were de-lish!  US Egg is one of our favorite Sunday morning breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE U.S. Egg.    It is our family's favorite place for breakfast.  WHY? - great service, yummy food, clean restaurant, nice outdoor eating area.    AND the Protien Pancakes are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Awesome fresh food, good size portions, served piping hot.  I had the Southwest Chicken Fried Steak and it was awesome. Prices are reasonable service is awesome and so is the atmosphere nice eating area outside.  Awesome job Leland. You will see us again for sure. Keep up the food work!!"}
{"text":"I eat at this place at least once a week! Love the protein pancakes. They give you a ton of food as well. Onwers always there and never to busy to come say hello."}
{"text":"Too expensive for the amount of food they server. I took chicken dish for lunch, they serve me with 2 piece sample size chicken sandwich. This is the second time I tried this restaurant since it is next to my work place. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"Breakfast the way it was meant to be! The skillets are AMAZING!! Protein pancakes are to die for! They have a gluten-free menu (which allows for a LOT of variety), and always cater to my dietary needs. Staff is always friendly. Weekends can get busy, but the food is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This week, my friend and I decided to check out this place for our weekly brunch.  It was ok.  Not awesome, but not bad, either.  My friend had the patented (yes, PATENTED) protein pancakes, and they were HUGE.  Some other people were passing our table to get seated and literally stopped to comment on the size of the pancakes.  Anyway, they've got blueberries, granola, cinnamon, and slivered almonds mixed into the batter, so it's quite the pancake.  I tried some and thought they were pretty good, but, like I said, not AWESOME.    I was feeling like a skillet that day, so I got the ham, sausage, and mushroom skillet with two eggs sunny-side up.  The potatoes came out a little bit on the hard side (as did my friend's side of potatoes he got), but it wasn't bad enough where I would be like, This is totally not edible.  On the plus side, the potatoes are Idaho potatoes, so they tasted yummy.  They would've been yummier, though, if they were fully cooked.    Price-wise, this place is probably a dollar too expensive given that the food isn't AWESOME and given that I've been to other brunch places where it's cheaper.  Waitresses know what they're doing, though, and the wait time to be seated wasn't bad at all.  15 minutes tops.  We had to park a little ways from the restaurant, but it was brunch, and the place is in a strip mall with other businesses, so it was expected.  Overall, my friend and I decided it was A-OK."}
{"text":"Great service great food even on Sundays when it gets crazy they always find us a seat quickly and are always willing to modify the order."}
{"text":"Expected More!! I visited on 1/19/16 with a friend. There are some \"niceties\" that most breakfast restaurants have, like soft butter on a warm pancake and I have even had heated plates so the item will stay warm. Also, a breakfast restaurant should have a variety of syrups. Our waitress looked dumbstruck when we asked for something other than maple.  It is colder now, even in AZ. Our cups were so cold, the coffee was cold half-way through the meal. We did not see a manager to talk to. I used to enjoy US Egg but probably won't return."}
{"text":"We absolutely love the US Egg on Chandler. This is the cleanest restaurant we have ever been in. The breakfast and lunches are the best. Always greeted when entering and someone always stops by to check on you. The servers are top notch. Thank you all for making us feel special. Farewell to a great guy, Matt. We will miss your kindness and smile. Good luck and take care."}
{"text":"Went for bfast on tue, had a bad experience at Scottsdale location, not sure what to expect here...service awesome, food wonderful and quick! Natalie was a super waitress, attentive, but not annoying. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast and this place really delivered, greeted at the door and felt welcome. Had excellent service from a terrific hostess named Em, and had the wonderful meat lovers idaho skillet. All in all my girlfriend and I had an enjoyable breakfast :) thanks a lot! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Handled a big group with 2 families quickly and great breakfasts cooked perfectly to order!"}
{"text":"The food is decent. However, if you want substitutions there are stipulations. I'm sorry, but don't list subs for extra $$ and then tell me I can't have what I wanted off of the substitution list."}
{"text":"The food was okay but not exceptional. Ordered eggs over easy, they came with completely set yolks. The bacon was good, the hash browns were like warmed over but no crisp on them.  The worst part was that we requested patio seating but did not realize until we were seated that the we would be sharing our breakfast time with dogs, some yapping, some smelly. We are from out of town and obviously will cross this chain off our list.  The least they could have done is let us know that patio is for the dogs."}
{"text":"Food is meadiocre! Prices are OUTRAGEOUS! I HAD EGGS BENEDICT, Orange Juice, side of ham, 23$ wtf???  Cost me 7 bucks at Cracker Barrel!! My vote is thumbs down!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing. Fair prices, outstanding food. Friendly and attentive staff. The owner is the main host. He is the one that greats you at the door and tells the waiters where to seat you. Everyone always has a smile on their face. Sometimes there is a wait. But I promise it is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"This was a vey nice place. The ambience was perfect especially the US flag made up of egg boxes, pretty impressive.I am not a big fan of the traditional omelette, but for my surprise that had a very nice egg skillet preparation which was my favorite. The best part was the oats protein pan cakes with fresh blueberries and prickly peach syrup.I will recommend this place anytime for a good brunch but make sure you starve at least for 6-8 hours to be able to finish the huge servings that they have. We went for a small hike in Tuscan after this meal and did not eat anything until late night ...A must go place when you visit Phoenix !"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great service, awesome breakfast! And the lunch is really good, too. The salads and burgers are delicious. Yum!"}
{"text":"Super service and great food. I tried the half and half with a chicken/avocado skillet and protein pancakes. DELICIOUS.  Will be back next week."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place, I dream about it when I don't get it. If they were open past afternoon I would probably eat there almost every day. Sante fe skillet and protein pancakes mm mm mmmm!!"}
{"text":"I'm dying for another good local breakfast place in Chandler.  I had high hopes for US Egg, but I can't recommend it.  The food was bland(not in a good way) coffee was weak and the service was slow.  I'm sticking with The Good Egg or 24 Carrots.  Even Mimi's is better (I'm not a fan of large corporate restaurants)."}
{"text":"US Egg has become my goto breakfast on the weekend, I try to go at least one weekend day every week.  It is the perfect place to relax and enjoy good food and good service.  First, the food.  I wish I could try more things, but I keep going back to my usual favorite - Protein Pancakes.  They are amazing!  Just the right combination of ingredients to make a pancake I could never duplicate.  The flavor just hits the spot, everytime.  The few times I have strayed from the norm I have not been disappointed.  The Hawkeye omelette is great, as well as the Chicken Fried Steak.  If I stray from the pancakes, it is usually to get the half and half, just so i can still have a little pancake with my egg dish.  Second, the service.  It is always busy, but you really never wait long for a table.  This is rare, but somehow US Egg manages to be efficient without rushing people.  If you walk in on the weekend morning and see a crowd, do not be discouraged, you will be seated in 5 or 10 minutes usually.  They even have coffee outside for you to enjoy while you wait, talk about great service!  The staff at US Egg has always been very friendly, I have never had a complaint.  Even if you had to wait a few minutes for something, you can just tell they are all trying their hardest to just make you happy and help you enjoy your meal.  They may not be perfect, but I found the tiny imperfections more than understandable and overlookable, which for me is hard to do.  The worst thing I could say is that one of my 2 giant pancakes was only about 3/4 of a pancake, cleverly hidden underneath the top cake.  Not a big deal, but a slight annoyance to see that hidden underneath instead of a proper pancake.  Also, things can be a little sticky the later you go in the day.  I guess the wipe downs go a little faster as the crew gets tired?  I found my thumb a little sticky after pouring coffee the other morning, which was easily remedied with a little water, but something that should have been properly cleaned prior to serving perhaps?  All in all, I will continue to enjoy my weekly breakfast at US Egg, and I think they do a fantastic job with the food and service!"}
{"text":"I'm usually here for breakfast every Sunday. The food is fantastic (try the protein pancakes packed with blueberries and granola), the service is quick and friendly, and the owner is always there making sure his customers are happy. Not the fanciest place, but the food more than makes up for it.   Great prices, and great food."}
{"text":"4 Stars until I try more of the menu!   Great service, very good food! A place I will go back to for sure as its my local Diner type place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I went to breakfast at this location and ordered the half and half, pancakes and skillet. It was terrible. Terrible is an understatement! The pancakes were over cooked, thin and the blueberries were not even real, they were dried like the ones you get in a Jiffy muffin mix. The skillet came with hardly any ham or vegetables, it was over stuffed with hash browns. I was furious!!! At $11.69 you would think it would be a fabulous breakfast. I asked the woman at the front who I believed to be the manager if she could do anything to fix the problem. She answered, I'll tell the cook not to fill it so many hash browns next time. Our waitress was in dream land not attentive and an airhead. I will never go there again!!! If you want a good quality breakfast, go to First Watch, the pancakes our delicious and they are stuffed with real berries and they serve you real maple syrup. The Good Egg has always been wonderful!"}
{"text":"The best pancakes in the world! Great service the owners are almost always there making sure that everyone is happy and gets what they need. Plus free WiFi!!!"}
{"text":"The half and half at US Egg is my favorite breakfast - choice of skillet with an egg and two protein pancakes.  Perfect.  Service is great, and has been great since I started coming here in the nineties.  My only minor complaint is the coffee:  drinkable, but generic and a little weak.  Overall, my favorite breakfast spot in the east valley.  Always a positive vibe."}
{"text":"No pride in presentation. Just food on a plate. Nothing special. In this day and age there is no excuse for week coffee. Although my omellette was hot the potatoes and English muffin were cold. If you have a choice between this place and Denny's choose Denny's."}
{"text":"Brunch this AM with friend who was lured by a sign spinner placed at Chandler Blvd exit from 101.  Sign said 3 minutes away.  Kyrene is  much farther than that from the 101.  Had veggie eggs Benedict.  Avocado slices were black at the ends, spinach had spoiled before cooking.  Slimy black leaves among bright green.  Really unpleasant mess.   Eggs old enough or so small there were no whites to savor.  Server did not ask how I wanted the eggs.  They came overcooked .  Mentioned and quietly showed her spoiled veggies so she could let someone in the kitchen know, and was told the spinach 'had been cooked'. She could not have cared less.  Inedible for $8.99.  Better food quality can be found at any IHOP.  Better quality control can be found at any McDonalds.  Lesson, if they need a sign spinner don't eat there!  Not even breakfast."}
{"text":"My favorite on Sunday, half n half with protein pancakes. The service is awesome.  The food is great and oh yeah, get there early. They pack it in by 9 am"}
{"text":"The protein pancakes that folks seem to rave about were undercooked and over priced. The coffee was old even though it was breakfast time. The server had other things to do other than wait on folks even though it was almost empty. How can you screw up breakfast this bad?"}
{"text":"I just wanted to do a shout out to the best server Holly. My friend Jasmyne and I came in to eat this morning and we lucked out with how great our service was. Holly you were awesome and thank you so much, your upbeat and cool personality made my whole day!"}
{"text":"U.S. Egg is a great family run biz.    i hv been i  the service industry for 20 years and this place is clean, quick, friendly and good food,.... this place is a must try"}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby and kids. Service and food was super yummy! Great service! Quick and super friendly! Highly recommend  Yummy and fun"}
{"text":"First time and the food is amazing. Had the waffles and it was great. The portions are crazy too."}
{"text":"US Egg located on Greenway.  The service was good, no complaints there.  I ordered the Durango breakfast burrito.  It was delivered in a 'gravy boat.'  I soon realized why, it was soupy.  The wrap was wet and laying in water.  The taste was okay but, nothing over the top.  When you walk into a breakfast place at 7AM on a Saturday morning and you're one of the few people there, it's a sign..."}
{"text":"Normally we have a wonderful experience with US Egg, particularly with the Scottsdale and Shea location. However, we were on the other side of town and decided to try the 7th St and Greenway location.  I am incredibly disappointed with the poor service and equally terrible food.  First, the server wouldn't pour our water into our glasses. She slammed down a pitcher of water and we were expected to serve ourselves. In addition, my boyfriend ordered a beverage and was never asked if he wanted a refill.  We know we aren't dining at the Ritz, and that would have been fine, but when the food came out, we were disappointed.  The image here portrays the soggy bread and cold meat that comprised my boyfriends sandwich. I received toast but no butter. After tracking down our server, we were advised that they didn't have any more butter but were trying to find some. Eventually I received two frozen butter packets to attempt to spread on my toast.  My boyfriend showed his sandwich to the manager who didn't apologize, but did take the dish away and state the dish would be remade. About 2 mins later, the dish returned, and it was abundantly clear that they just added a fresh layer of melted cheese to the sandwich. We decided to just finish our food and leave, however, our server spent the rest of the time avoiding our table.  We were disappointed when we did receive the bill to find that they still charged us for the crappy sandwich.  I felt bad not leaving a tip, but I couldn't justify tipping after such poor service, food and a seemingly inadequate response to poor customer service."}
{"text":"My family LOVES to have breakfast here on the weekends.  They have recently renovated the dining area and it is a very pleasant place to spend time together on a relaxed Saturday morning - the food is great!"}
{"text":"My wife had the tuna melt,  a delightful sandwich with moist tuna but not drenched in mayonnaise.  It also has onion and tomato but not overwhelmed by cheese.  I had the jalapeño burger.   It is correctly named because it has fresh jalapeños grilled to perfection on top of this delicious burger.   Accompanying the peppers is jack cheese and the normal burger toppings.  I had eaten there a while ago and noticed that business was down this time.   Chatting with the manager /owner he said they were having a hard time overcoming the negative image left by the previous occupant.   They should prepare mini sandwiches of their food and mini breakfast items that they can keep at proper temperature and then go right to numerous office buildings before work and hand out the free food.   Also create coupons and hand them out there too.   I bet their reputation will spread rapidly.   It. might take effort but this place deserves to flourish."}
{"text":"As soon as we paid the check, the waiter interrupted our conversation and asked us to relocate."}
{"text":"Oh U.S. Egg, how I miss what you used to be.  My wife and I have been coming here for years and ordering the same thing each time.  But recently, your food is just disappointing.  I think it was around the time you started playing around with your potatoes 2 years ago and they seemed to change weekly before you finally decided to go with hash browns.  I can't say I am surprised you stuck with hash browns - that is what every average or sub-average restaurant chooses.  It is quick and simple, compared to the effort to make home style potatoes.  Our omelette is never consistent or fluffy or moist anymore.  Half the time you forget something in the omelette - literally, we now check it when it comes out before taking the first bite.    You are now just like Ihop or Denny's to me, but I don't understand your lines on the weekend.  I have left you for a better breakfast place."}
{"text":"My eggs were under-done (runny whites), they gave my wife basted eggs instead of over medium, and the waitress twice misquoted me the price of the special (I feel the price should have been written on the special's board anyway). The Sonoran burrito was tasty. The waitress was nice."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  We went there and my wife ordered a Veggie Benedict.  The one they brought out had bacon on it, not good for a vegetarian.  She sent it back and the waitress said she'd bring out a new one.  It was brought out within two minutes.  My wife asked if this was the same one, just with the bacon removed.  The waitress said, no, there was a mix-up and she just brought out the wrong one.  Well guess what was under some of the toppings...the bacon they couldn't pull off!  I don't know if the waitress lied to us or the kitchen staff lied to her, but it was not a pleasant experience.  Also, we waited about 20 minutes from placing our order to when it was brought out, half way through that time, the waitress came by and said \"your food will be out in just a sec.\"  Obviously not her fault, but something she should not have promised.  There were other issues as well, but that is enough for now.  STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"I dub this place my favorite breakfast restaurant in the valley, though I don't get over there as often as I'd like. If I could eat breakfast here everyday.... I WOULD! I can't get enough of the protein cakes - bring. it. on! The eggs are good. The potatoes are great.   THE END."}
{"text":"Really fast service, amazing quality food. The sausages taste really great, and the whole wheat pancakes were a really great surprise. Sort of on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for. Enjoyed it very much!"}
{"text":"You know that Aleah girl? She tight yo. She asked about my hash browns and I was like, \"eh\" and she came back with the perf dish of hash browns"}
{"text":"I'd give this restaurant 0 stars if I could. I've visited this location numerous times over the past few years it's been open & have received okay service in the past. My most recent visit on 9/23/15 will be my last. My brother & I were out & decided to grab some brunch. Since this was the closest breakfast/lunch establishment in vicinity to my house I picked US EGG.  Our server was Caitlin. She was unpleasant  from the beginning & we initially ignored it. But as time went on, her attitude could no longer be ignored. The interesting thing is she didn't treat her other tables the way she treated ours. She didn't even bother to check on us once she brought our orders. Once we were done & she came to bring the bill, she had the nerve to ask if we needed anything else! I guess it's a miracle to find decent service anymore. Needless to say, she received no tip & I'm now yelping 1 star. The food is overpriced for the quality & the selection is very limited. My advice, stay home & eat a bowl of cereal."}
{"text":"What can I say? We love U.S. Egg! We've been coming here religiously for quite some time because the food is always spot on and we're treated like family. I love breakfast food, and although the prices are a little higher than other places in the area, we keep coming back because the consistency and quality are worth every penny! We're partial to the avocado and jack omelet and either their Belgian waffle or Triple Play. And of course bacon. Gotta have the bacon."}
{"text":"I am experiencing my first trip to Spring Training and my friend, Jeff Kane, treated me to breakfast today. I am here from the central Coast of California and I can honestly tell you that this breakfast, including the service, was as enjoyable as any I have ever had."}
{"text":"We came across this place last Saturday morning as a quick stop before running errands.  I didn't have the highest of expectations, as I hadn't eaten here prior.  We were seated immediately, and greeted just as fast.  Our server Lindzy was cheerful, polite and very helpful in suggestions.  The coffee was strong and flavorful without being overpowering, and before we finished our first cup, our food was in front of us. Highly recommend the chicken fried steak, and the California Benedict was fantastic.  Great experience all around, will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The food, is the standard US egg quality. Which is to say it is above average/pretty good. However, the service at this specific location is less than stellar. My last two visits, I waited for several minutes, while the staff seemingly oblivious to my existence stood around and talked amongst themselves. My patience, already wore thin from my previous visit, quickly ran out, and I left without eating."}
{"text":"US Egg is by far my favorite breakfast place in the valley.   If you've never had a protein pancake Santa Fe half and half you're missing out in life.   The people who go to US Egg and are disappointed are the people who have clearly never had a protein pancake or waffle because it's basically heaven.  One try and you'll never want another pancake again!  If only I could figure out the batter I'd probably live on them."}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast burrito, which was delivered very quickly, but it was only lukewarm and had obviously been prepared well in advance because the burrito was wet on the bottom from having sat in the frig for a long period.  The hash browns were cold and soggy as well, very disappointing."}
{"text":"The first time I visited was when they first opened, and I was not a fan... Slow service and the food was so-so. We tried it again months later & I'm so glad we did! We have been back 4 or 5 times now, and the service is always wonderful. The food is really good too. My husband loves the protein pancakes. I love the eggs & bacon (they're always cooked perfectly). I also really liked the California eggs Benedict.   I think the thing that really sets this place apart from other restaurants that offer standard breakfast food is the service. Not only are the servers always nice and helpful, but the bussers are also really quick and seem very happy. Happy staff, great food, convenient location. Oh and I saw a sign that said they now serve alcohol, which I imagine some folks (not myself) might enjoy with breakfast."}
{"text":"Protein pancakes good. Not fan of the Idaho skillet though. Prices may be a little high compared to Ihop and Village Inn. Menu is quite varied. Decor is pleasant. the place was full on a Sunday morning when we went.  Family owned and operated in AZ since 1991. Have other locations around the valley too. Typical diner food. Again to be fair, as a vegetarian, my choices on the menu are quite limited."}
{"text":"We stubbled across this little place a couple years back looking for a breakfast place while visiting our son, now it's our go to when in AZ.  Went there again on Easter with some friends and it was just as good as I remembered. We had a bit of a wait but they do serve complimentary coffee on the patio, nice touch.  Large menu selection so something for everyone. Staff were pleasant & food was yummy and liked by all."}
{"text":"Just finishing another fantastic meal here at the US Egg  on Bell Road Just west of I-17...stop in have a great breakfast or lunch you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Okay, so I found this in my \"drafts\" from April. It's about time I gIve Natalie the shout out she deserves.......Just finished a delish breakfast here and had GREAT service from Natalie! You know you have a conscientious server when they take the time to warm the butter pads for easy spreading."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the choices!  Just a bit of everything. Service was great and food was fantastic. Definitely hooked on the protein pancakes and will visit frequently. :-)"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and it was amazing! Eggs were cooked to perfection and service was totally on top of it. My coffe cup never even got half way empty :) seems the communication among the staff is wonderful. Im not sure of our waitresses name but she was super friendly and ready to go its nice to see someone that early in the morning take pride in the appearance. Im not much of a morning person my self but ill. Definitely be back soon .Great job!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place one morning looking for somewhere new to us.  We were pleasantly surprised by how much we liked it. The protein pancakes are my new craving!  Love them!  The only reason I didn't give the final star is only because seating at this location is a little weird. Our second time we were seated right next to the kitchen door where my husband could watch everything. He didn't enjoy that. The food however has been great each time!  If you're looking for somewhere to go I highly recommend this place. It gets busy so go early!"}
{"text":"Love this place for their protein pancakes!  Everything else has been good too the only problem I've had at this location, (I've only been to this one and the greenway location) my eggs both times I went and ordered over medium I got them with some runny whites. I sent back and it was corrected. One time accident, two times makes me think the cook may need some additional training. I went again today and ordered scrambled. Everything else there has been wonderful and I will go back and will recommend US Egg!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Pancakes and the skillets are amazing. Great atmosphere, quick service, quality food for the price. HUGE Portions!"}
{"text":"I come here every week. The food is aways good and the portions are big. The owner Mario always greets you with a smile and remembers your name. The service from the entire staff is Top Notch. You can't go wrong here for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great coffee, prices are good but wish I could have given 5+ stars, .......  Why do cooks not pay attention to a customer's request???  Bacon crisp means crispy bacon! Needless to say could not eat my omelet. :(."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at U.S. EGG. We're from Houston. This was our first stop. The food was delicious and the servers are just wonderful. The atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. I really like the low carb menu. Friendly staff. Get there early as there can usually be a long line on weekends because of the great food.  Huge menu with plenty of food options to choose from."}
{"text":"We drove 45 minutes just so we could eat here... The food is ALWAYS spectacular. Huge portions, extremely friendly staff, hot/strong coffee, and the atmosphere is lovely! Definitely (by far) our favorite breakfast place. We love coming here! Cheyenne was our server today.. Full of smiles, great recommendations and just a pleasure. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The protein pancakes are the best. Come hungry, leave full!  You cannot resist the half $ half combo, the best value I feel. We have been coming here for a couple months now that we live in this area and its always been great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!, I have came here more than a hundred times and every single time the food is fresh and hot. I always bring new people with me to try the food and they go there all the time too!."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at U.S. Egg 4 or 5 times. the first couple of times we were served very well and the food was good, not over the moon. The last few times the food was very mediocre, at best. the eggs were literally as big as nickels, very sad. The sausage is \"sizzelean\" type sausage. The frozen kind. Very disapointed, they also bring you a whole picture of water or ice tea, wow,what a waste of resources. what the place has going for it is: staff, friendly, location, we need a good breakfast place in the neighborhood. Food is cooked well. but poor quality food, IEO, poor sausage, small eggs, cold pre made bacon. Good ingredients are expensive, but for what you are charging, average $10.00 per breakfast,customers should have good consistent food, and plenty of it, AKA The Place, 51st and Bell.    I would like to see this place succeed, but they have to step up their game, there are places in our neighborhood that do it consistent, Village Inn, Denny.s ect......you could be a standard. pick up your game!"}
{"text":"Always consistent...great meal..great service. Hawkeye with protein pancakes is a winner."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast!   Got the half and half. Protein pancakes and sante fe.   Huge portions and fresh food! Wish they would open one in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"We thought we would try this new location because the one at Mill and  Baseline really needs a makeover...it looks old and worn.  Anyway, we ordered a couple of omelettes and tried to \"health\" them up a bit...we can't eat carbs so we tried to substitute fruit for our english muffin and tomatoes for the potatoes, and take off the cheese.  Well, one came with the cheese, and we were upcharged for the fruit.  The ingredients were placed in the omelette like a sandwich...not actually cooked in the omelette.  The omelette (egg) was small and not very fluffy.  I don't think we should have to pay extra for trying to eat healthy, and the fruit that was provided was certainly not worth the upcharge.  Our server seemd constantly distracted, but she was reasonably pleasant when engaged.  We have had a much better experience at Good Egg on Ray Road.  Overall...a disappointment and we probably won't return unless the menu and the food gets \"re-tooled\" a bit to help those who want to have healthy choices without being penalized."}
{"text":"Must've ordered the \"wrong\" thing...had corn beef hash with eggs; hash was canned (complete with bone fragment), food tepid when served; grits were undercooked and flavorless but hey, at least they're only $1.75 extra. Coffee is undrinkable and the waitress shortchanged me. Used to be a great place for breakfast but it sure wasn't this time around. Is there a decent breakfast place in the Tempe area? Somebody help..."}
{"text":"READ THIS!! FIND ANOTHER PLACE!  VERY DISAPPOINTED! 'Heard about the food being good, so we went. Stood outside for 35 minutes before being seated. Place kinda small. If you have more than 4 people, seating will be an issue. We had 7 people for a birthday. We were given a booth with an additional table extended to it. Which left only 12\" between the end of our table and the wall, no exaggeration, it was 12\". It was even hard for the waitress to pass through. It was VERY loud. Couldn't hear anyone from the other side of the table. The waitress had to talk above the noise to take our orders. It took over 45 minutes to receive ANY food. My food was served cold. One of our guests received someone else's order from another table, so it was ANOTHER 15 minutes before one of our guests received their food. (I was embarrassed it happened since I suggested this place and there was no apology from waitress.)  The FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE at best. Maybe it is better warm?? We WILL NOT be returning nor recommending."}
{"text":"Living in Ahwatukee there are not many places for a good traditional breakfast.  IHOP, Denny's, Crackers (Tried to kill us literally) so I am setting my bar low.  I have been in three times and all three were pleasant experiences.  The first time I ordered OJ and the protein pancakes.  The OJ was not fresh but it was fine.  The protein pancakes were excellent.  Service was slow for the drinks but fast for the food.  Everything was warm and cooked well.   The second time I went with two friends and ordered the two eggs breakfast with wheat toast.  The eggs were perfectly cooked as were the hashbrowns.  Both could have used some more salt and pepper but I was able to add that.  Service was good, a little slow but manageable.  The last time I went with my two kids and husband.  I ordered the same breakfast as above and it was good.   The place is brand new and clean.  My biggest complaint is the uniforms.  I am all for trendy but the tight. short shorts need to go.  My waitress shorts should not be shorter than her apron.   Jeans would be much more professional.   Compared to my others options this one is rated on top.  Also the last two times I have gone the place has been crowded.  I think they are working out the kinks of being new and this will be a good breakfast place."}
{"text":"Here for SF Giants 'Spring Training,' GO Giants. This morning we went here to have breakfast. Place was busy, we waited for about 15 minutes to be seated but they have seating and coffee outside while you wait for your name to be called. We didn't mind. Service was good, the food was very good. I ordered, and recommend, the Half n Half. It's a skillet order of your choice--I had Country Fried Steak, Sausage, Onions, Green Peppers, and one egg over medium. I excluded the Ham and Bacon but the most important was the Sausage Gravy that covered it all!!  Mmmm. So, it's half the order of the full skillet which is too much food anyways..... It comes with 2 pancakes, which I excluded because why have pancakes when you can have a crunchy waffle with walnuts and blueberries inside??? Oh so good! If I am ever in this area again (from California) I will not only eat here again but I will repeat the same order. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Protein pancakes are wonderful. Pick those with a 1/2 omlette and you've got a great breakgast. Fresh food. Great service."}
{"text":"Super breakfast! Half n Half: skillet with chicken potatoes egg avocado cheese. Yum! Plus protein pancakes. Great service. Coffee pot on our table. You definitely have to try this one!"}
{"text":"wow! finally, breakfast done right. i was quoted 15 minutes by the owner(?) on a busy sunday morning and that is how long it took. the service was fast and the food was delicious. our server made sure we were well taken care of and the manager  stopped by to ask how our food was. we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Came in around 9:45 am on a Sunday & though there was a wait it was less then 10 minutes which was nice since I was starving. I had the Meat Lovers Skillet which was hash browns topped with cheese, egg, sausage, ham, bacon, & a country fried steak & gravy. It was DELICIOUS!!! & huge. I was only able to eat about half. I will definitely be returning. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because our waitress wasn't the best. She never asked my husband if he wanted more orange juice which he finished before his dish got there. Luckily he had water. Other then that though, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"My breakfast was delish.  I had the Hawkeye and that chicken,  bacon and avocado was scrumptious.  We also had a wonderful waitress, good service without hovering."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times, mostly out of convenience since it is close by,  but this place is perfectly average. I've had a couple omelets, the New York, Texan, some other ramdoms. Omelets are always pretty good. They come with hashbrowns that are gross and limp every time. They seem like frozen hashbrowns they pop in the microwave  for a minute. Worse though is the service. This morning there was plenty of seating and we got seated right next to the prep/kitchen area where all the servers are. They were loud and gossipy the whoooollleee time. I felt like I was om display sitting there not 2 feet away, pretending like I couldn't hear every bit of conversation. If you're going to sit someone there, have some discretion and tone down the high school gossip. Completely ruined and just okay breakfast. We ended up splitting something because there portions are quite large and we aren't huge breakfast eaters. Commom sense should tell our server to bring or at least offer an extra plate. The thought must not have occured to her, because even though we got a chilli omelette,  we had to eat it from the center of the table. Overall decided it was pretty blah and not worth the bill. The coffee was not good either, tasted burned or as if it was sitting under the warmer for hours. Wouldn't really recommend to anyone. I've recieved better service at your average Ihop and the bill was lower. Not saying it was terribly pricey, just didn't meet the quality of food or service for a specialty place. Just PASS."}
{"text":"Excellent, fast service, delicious, perfectly prepared food.  Don't miss the protein pancakes...fantastic."}
{"text":"I was here last Thursday with my best friend to celebrate her birthday. I'll always wanted to try this breakfast place but for some reason didn't. The place looked nice and bright inside and there was good music going.Anyways i ordered the tradition breakfast and my friend ordered the spinach Florentine. We were so excited to get our food but when it came out it didn't look good at all. when i complained that my eggs weren't cooked right and my potatoes were pretty much raw. I asked to get my potatoes and bacon crispy. Our waitress seemed annoyed by this point. While i was waiting i tried my friends spinach Florentine and it was horrible.She didn't want to send it back. My food came back the same and i ate what i could. The bill was outrageous and the waitress was rude. All in all I will never go back to this place or recommend it to anyone i know. I've had better food at the good egg."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Pros: Good size servings, reasonable prices, very friendly staff, prompt service, good atmosphere, great for families. Cons: coffee is not that great.  The food is tasty. What we've tried that's good: omelettes, hash browns, chicken fried steak,  protein pancake,  eggs florentine. The orange juice is fresh and tasty.  The only thing we didn't like that much is the corn beef hash; not that great.   Definitely will be coming back ."}
{"text":"The PLACE for breakfast. I am new to Tempe and have been hearing raves about this place so my roommate and I tried it for brunch one Saturday. It was a little crowded and noisy but that's how you know it's popular and a good choice. I order a waffle with peanut butter and he ordered an omlette but I forget which one. My waffle was fluffy and warm and came with a heeping serving a peanut butter, syrup and butter that melted like heaven on a warm plate. My roommate olette had avacado and chicken in it and made me jealous I didn't order it as well!  The servers were all clad in ASU gear which I though was fun and the walls had some funky egg carton art that was cool to look at. Service wasn't exceptional but I'm going to guess that was because it was so busy. I paid $25 for both our breakfasts and tip. Thought that was a little much.   I def recommend this place though!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food. Come hungry because the portions are huge. I had the Arizona frittata, and everything was fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Terrible! My cup was dirty, eggs uncooked. When I brought it to the managers attention he was a pompous jerk. Telling me that \"there's the door. Maybe I should cook at home\" The eggs were uncooked to the point of health hazard.   The only service I got was awful food and rude arrogant management. I will never be coming back to this establishment.  I left feeling nauseous and verbally abused.  If you do eat at this establishment CHECK YOUR EGGS AND DISHES!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place gets really busy on the weekends so go early if you don't want to wait. The protein pancakes are delicious! And they have yummy OJ too. Service is always fast which I personally love!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place thats been at the same spot for years, owned by some Iowa brothers I believe. They always have hot looking waitresses, breakfast is always perfect!!"}
{"text":"The Fam went here yesterday for breakfast. It was packed and surprisingly we were seated quickly actually less than what we were quoted which was not long in the first place. I digress, the food was awesome, the chorizo had just the right spice and plenty of chorizo on my Border. Wifey had the New York omelette. She was impressed with the chicken and how moist it was. We are two for two coming to this location. Really kid friendly as well. We are price conscious when we go out with the kids and they hit it on the mark $4.99 per with a drink to boot. This is our weekend spot. Either Scottsdale or Chandler just depends on where were at...........is it Saturday yet! ;)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the valley.  I used to go to the Scottsdale location more, but now I generally go to this location, because it is DOG FRIENDLY!  Yay!  The food is of the same consistent quality of the Scottsdale restaurant.  Same menu, same great protein pancakes, etc.  I recommend the half-and-half (see further description in my review of the Scottsdale location)  I don't find this one to be as busy as the Scottsdale location, but there can be a wait on weekends.  But I've found the servers and ownership to be very helpful, in particular when we have brought dogs.  Because this locaiton is dog friendly, it gets an extra star pushing it to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. 5 stars for the service!!  I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was bland. The chicken strips were over cooked. But the scrambled eggs and gravy were GREAT!! I was just very disappointed at how boring the flavor was in the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant five stars because the food it never disappoints us and the staff is always friendly & courtesy & accommodating."}
{"text":"Tried them for breakfast on a mid-week morning.  I had the \"Going South\" omelette.  What a big disappointment.  The chorizo was tasteless and the green chilies tasted like they were added at the last moment from the can.  The food was luke warm.  The coffee was just OK.  This the first time I had been back after a 10 year absence.  I remember the great breakfasts I had here.  Maybe I picked a bad day since the restaurant was almost empty at 7am.  I am afraid I won't be returning since there are other places I have found that are better."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, our favorite place for breakfast!  We love the service and the quality of the food.  We usually try to go before 'rush hour' on the weekends, to avoid the long waits...so try to get there before 9:30 am. This place is family friendly and the service is super fast, even when they are busy on the weekends, we have never waited more than 10-12 min for our food....even when we have a large party. Their portions are huge and their prices are excellent, for the quantity of food you get. They have the best chorizo in town! We love their omelets, home fries, skillets and their pancakes...yummy!"}
{"text":"Another location of this restaurant chain has gotten some good press in the newspaper recently, so when this location opened, I was eager to try it.  Overall I was dissapointed and won't be going back.  Their real coffee is weakish and slightly acidic.  Their decaf coffee was better but also weak.  Eggs are pale and bland.  Hash Browns have nice appearance but are also bland.  On the bright side, Biscuits and Gravy are good, with buiscuits being fluffy (a rarity).  Service is excellent and the atomosphere of the place is nice and bright."}
{"text":"There bacon and eggs was the bomb I and the waffles were even better make sure to try a protein waffle"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  The menu has plenty of options from eggs, pancakes, waffles, and all the breakfast items you've come to know and love.  I chose the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, and an English muffin.  Corned beef hash is a nostalgic thing for me and I don't see it on many menus anymore, so I always jump at the opportunity.  The hash had a good crust on it from the griddle and tasted just like I wanted it to.  The eggs, hashbrowns, and English muffin were perfect."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  I go here almost weekly for breakfast on Sunday mornings.  I have yet to be disappointed in the service or food quality.  I enjoy sitting at the bar area plus you don't have to wait for seats.  Sunday mornings are usually pretty busy.  I like that they give you pitchers of what you order (water, iced tea, coffee) so you don't have to wait for refills.  The servers are always attentive though so I doubt you would wait even if they didn't.  The only negative is that some of the (two top) tables are pretty small.  For one person it would be okay but two people plus all your food and beverage items really fill it up.  No extra room for reading, etc."}
{"text":"It's a decent breakfast joint capable of more.  The interior was clean and decorated nicely.  Service was quick and polite.  Eggs were okay, and the bacon was decent.  Most of the food was Gordon Food Service quality - could be better.    The clear plates were weird and almost all food sweats after it's been cooked, but actually seeing the wetness on the bottom of the food was disgusting. Using white plates would solve this.    Hash browns were smashed down on the grill which is a rookie mistake.  FYI- Grill the hash in heaps and the outside crisps while leaving a fluffy center.    Over all it's decent place.  Needs help in the food and presentation department, but give it a try, it's a pretty good place overall."}
{"text":"I like the name!  I like the food better...but I like the name.  This place is busy..and that is because the food is pretty tasty.  Voluminous choices on the menu.  I'd just like to say the California Benedict is super good.  Actually, from the pancakes to the skillets to sandwiches...it's all good.  Really good. Not surprisingly, yet interestingly, even though this place does a killer business and you might have wait....it's never very long. 5-10 mins. No big deal and if they say it's a 5 minute wait you can count on it. So...here is the thing. Service. Very hit and miss.  Sometimes you get lucky and get someone with a great personality..other times it's a bit rushed and less friendly. Overall, love this place!"}
{"text":"This place rocks my socks. I have been to this location twice now and they are always friendly. The chicken fried steak is delicious, and I eat chicken friend steak every where I go.   My girlfriend orders the spinach florentine and that has so much flavor I always want to get it the next time.   You walk in and can just feel the warmth of the place. The staff basically treats you like family on thanksgiving day.   Keep it up. I recommend you to everyone."}
{"text":"The service (arrival of food) was QUICK!  The pricing absolutely affordable.  Pleasant folks.  We're going to go back one more time before we go on a road trip.    This place is more affordable in comparison to many breakfast/brunch places."}
{"text":"Apple juice was too small and it tastes bad. Food was cold it all wasn't that great. I personally would definitely not go here again."}
{"text":"Protein pancakes are unique and delicious, place gets busy but service is great."}
{"text":"Corn beef hash amazing 15 min wait on Sunday not bad very friendly  Irish coffee to die for   Amazing all around"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here last week.  It had been awhile since eating here because I live so far, but was in the area and every once in awhile get a craving for the protein pancakes.  It's the only dish I've ever had here and they are awesome!  So delicious and very filling too! The server was good and overall my experiences here have always been very good."}
{"text":"The service was great and really friendly. Their protein pancakes were unique and delightful. The decor was all egg related which was cute with their theme."}
{"text":"Visited this place 3 times and the experience went from pretty good, to not great, to won't return. If you put the word egg in your name I would expect that the eggs you prepare would be excellent, but that is not the case. Pancakes were borderline burned, coffee was bitter, the waitstaff while friendly was not very helpful, and although the protein pancakes are pretty good the entire breakfast for my family of 4 cost as much as a dinner usually does so we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Been  going to USEgg for years portions are large service is great. Kids love it always ask to get breakfast on sunday. Never had a bad dish. Thanks Usegg keep it up."}
{"text":"This location has amazing staff (long term) and service...every single person working here is top quality!!  I have enjoyed 50+ plus patio breakfast meals here.  If there is ever a delay or problem, it is immediately addressed.  The protien pancake with a side of crispy bacon is my go to.  Only reason I cant give a 5 star is the chlorine taste in the water, coffee and tea."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. My favorite breakfast spot, and the coffee shop menu makes it a good place to go when your group can't agree on a place to eat. The only negative for me is the blaring country music. That cost them a star."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast joint, open until 2:30 in the afternoon. I usually get protein waffles or the Dan Majerle low carb omelette. Their protein pancakes and waffles are amazing! Good service and nice staff, and a super clean dining room and bathroom. Minus one star for undercooking my eggs sometimes, but other than that they're perfect."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots! The protein pancakes are divine! The chicken, bacon, avocado skillet is another tasty favorite. The staff is friendly and work really hard to make sure customers are taken care of despite the crowds. When the food is this good, crowds and a brief wait is to be expected. Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for the gluten free French toast which was tasty but nothing special and he had hash browns which were awful. Our waitress was sweet but we were left alone for 15 mins and had to flag her down for refills. We also were behind the host stand where a manger was flirting with several employees and talking  badly about coworkers and customers instead of asking about our service or food. This is not the first time service was poor here and we will not be coming again."}
{"text":"I love US Egg! I had never heard of this place before, but now I'm a big fan. They had really delicious items on the menu--lots of items with avocado and Monterey jack cheese, which admittedly is my favorite combination of food. They had a pretty wide variety of items on the menu--omlettes, other breakfast foods with protein, hearty sandwiches, and salads. Everything seemed like good quality, delicious food. I ended up getting the Club Sandwich (turkey, ham, avocado, bacon, and Monterey jack cheese--YUM), with a side of hash browns. I wish I could have finished it all, it was delicious. Besides the food, the waitresses were all really friendly, and got us everything we needed. The physical restaurant was also really nice--a very calm color scheme of calm ocean blue walls and white wainscoting. I'll return next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"We go here regularly.  Never been disappointed with the food and service. Gluten free options and great bloody marys. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"LOVE US Egg! The food is awesome: tasty, fresh, good portion size. The servers are helpful without being intrusive. The last time we were there, the server offered us \"to go\" drinks, which is SO helpful in Arizona in July. The coffee is delicious (I bought a bag to bring home), and my Bloody Mary was excellent! This is the fourth time we've been here, and we've had a great experience each time. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely DE-licious and Holy portions! We have been wanting to try this place for a while and so glad we finally did! The customer service tops it all off because it is phenomenal! While you are waiting to be seated they provide complimentary coffee and water. Because we were first time customers, the manager, who came to check on us a few times, gave us a free Protein Pancake to try because this is what a lot of people come for. So good! We are definitely gonna come back here and are planning on bringing our out of town family next time! If you haven't been here...GO!"}
{"text":"Just about the best breakfast in the east valley. I've enjoyed coming here for many years. Food and service are always dependable. Great place to bring out of towners as there's something here to make everyone happy. You can't go wrong here.  Even at the busiest times, wait times are short. I always come at peak times on weekends and almost never wait."}
{"text":"Food and service is always fantastic! The half and half is where it's at!!  Mario, the owner, always takes good care of us. We love it here!"}
{"text":"Awesome Breakfast!!! Had the Meat Lovers skillet and it was so hearty and was a huge portion of pork lovin plus the chicken fried steak! Very picky about my hash browns but theses hash browns were perfect, not overly salty or to dark, but perfectly balanced. Server was attentive and the restaurant was nice and clean. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and really fast to sit down.  We were able to sit down in less than 10 and had food in next 15, although they were very busy.    Kids had chocolate chip pancakes (whole wheat) and loved it.  Would definitely be back, server was amazing."}
{"text":"food is ok.  standard fair.  good selection overall, and friendly staff.  seems always busy and for me it was the only option open on new years day before we ran out of patience and just wanted breakfast.  not bad.... just never been blown away by us egg."}
{"text":"Husband kids and I had breakfast here at US egg food was kinda bland and it kinda reminded us of dennys its was okay not that great!  They did have good customer service!  Reason why we gave 3 stars because of the service."}
{"text":"casual, fun and great food!  Love coming here for a quick breakfast with the boyfriend, we both love the protein pancakes-AMAZING!  The service is always good and it's not crazy over priced.  Don't go in here trying to impress people with the decor, or an over the top breakfast experience but for your local go to spot for breakfast US Egg is the spot to go. :)"}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant and the gluten free pancakes are a favorite.  Melissa is the best and always makes sure we are taken care of."}
{"text":"Came here with family for Sunday lunch. Place was packed but seating wait time was not long. One recommendation to management is to change your drink glasses. These glasses are tiny (about 12 oz or less). Your waiters/waitresses most fo the time are congregating near restroom area and talking. Maybe just waiting on food order from kitchen but doesn't look good. Food wait time is not good or bad but wait seems to be longer than usual. Food taste is average like any iHOP.  Please do something about the glasses"}
{"text":"Nice Surprise! Place is almost hidden from view on Baseline and Mill in Tempe. A full parking lot out front should not deter you. Plenty of parking out back. The menu has plenty for everyone's diet and hunger. Diane made sure our niece Eva's request for a custom made pancake was taken care of. I had the Santa Fe skillet that was the best I've ever had. My wife had enjoyed the lean protein and vegetable dish. This place is good for small to large parties. The wait staff is very attentive despite how busy they are. Add this to your go to place for breakfast."}
{"text":"High prices, ok taste, great portions, excellent service. I don't mind paying higher prices if I walk out feeling full and satisfied. This place certainly left me feeling satisfied. For breakfast dishes I feel this place is over priced and the taste is nothing to brag about. However,  the staff is friendly, fast and courteous. Walked in with high expectations but cane up short."}
{"text":"I'm going to join the small group of reviewers that wasn't \"wow-ed\" by this place.  I tried it twice, never wanting to rush to judgment.  My conclusion is, really, that this is a pretty mediocre restaurant.  In our two visits, we experienced over-cooked eggs, under-cooked hash browns, runny hollandaise, and generally bland food.  I am honestly somewhat baffled by the high reviews.  It's not terrible, it's just not worthy of more than two stars.  I will admit this: The servers and staff are very friendly, and probably the only saving grace.  I'd eat here again if it was the only place that didn't have a huge wait, but I'll stick to the Good Egg for now."}
{"text":"I will say this - I have never really been impressed with breakfast, either made myself or at a restaurant, but I am very impressed with U.S. Egg!  The interior was really nice with decently sized tables and cool decor - like a US Flag made out of egg cartons (with eggs as the stars)!  The food portions were big - and they even have gluten-free toast, french toast and waffles! Wow! It's hard enough finding gluten-free food in a restaurant, let alone actual bread items!  I ordered the eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, and two pieces of toast. The eggs were supposedly only two eggs, but looked more like four - it was a lot of eggs (in a good way!) The hashbrowns were crispy, eggs were fluffy and not overcooked, and bacon thick, crunchy, and not too fatty. The toast was actually really good, considering a lot of gluten-free bread can be pretty mediocre to awful.  It was a little bit pricy - $24 for two meals and a pitcher of soda - but I was happy with my meal to the point of tipping a little extra.   I suggest stopping here if you want a great breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Our server Shelby seemed to be more interested in her nails and chatting with the hostess than checking on her tables. I ordered my steak medium rare and when it came out well done she was nowhere to be found until we already finished our meal and then she went back up to chat with the hostess again and didn't bring our check until we had to flag her down. The best part is my husband's food was cold because it was probably sitting on the line waiting for the chef to cook the life out of my steak that was supposed to be medium rare."}
{"text":"It's a breakfast joint, that caters to the health food fanatics as well as the big boy club. The staff is well selected- good looking women. The food beats your typical breakfast places(Denny's, IHOP, & Village) but not the best."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  Carmine runs a tight ship.  My wife loves the protein pancakes."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite breakfast spot! The food is excellent and the service is always great! Yes, get there late in the AM and they'll be a wait but it's worth it! The Protein Pancakes are infamous...a must have! I also love the Hawkeye Omelette with egg whites. I highly recommend them for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for a couple years now and I realized I've never reviewed this place. Maybe because it's so awesome; the food, the great service, the wonderful staff and especially the owner/manager Carmine, who is the best, that I want to keep it to myself. The place is always hopping, especially on Saturday and Sunday. I have too many favorites to mention, okay the skillets, the omelettes and everything else sooooooo yummy! Go check it out! The wait is never very long and even if it does get long it's sure worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent! Despite being packed we were seated quickly. Our waitress was great and kept our drinks filled. I had the Half and Half with the protein pancakes and the avocado, chicken, bacon skillet. It was delicious and very filling! The portions were great for the price and I was very satisfied. I will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Always saw a lot of cars here on the weekends so we decided to try it for breakfast. We were greeted right away and seated right away. Our waitress was very nice and took our order of eggs over medium, an omelet and coffees. Coffee came quickly (weak) followed by the food shortly thereafter. After having a few bites of the eggs, potatoes and toast we both agreed it was nothing special and we could get this breakfast anywhere. It wasn't bad. We just weren't impressed with the food or the atmosphere. Had to look for the waitress to get coffee refills and had to get up and find her to get the check. Probably wont be back."}
{"text":"I don't see how this place stays in business. Entrees often come out near room temperature. Everything tastes like grease. Spotty service with long waits for refills. They really don't care."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! Every time we come in we get the same server and she is the absolute sweetest! I'm a server myself and I can definitely get some pointers from her. Last time we went we split the Santa Fe skillet but got no chicken, extra chorizo and add avocado and it was so amazing! I can't have cheese so they were really accommodating on only putting cheese on half. The pancakes are to die for as well! My boyfriend loves that they put an entire carafe of coffee at our table so we never have to ask for more. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Everything is really fresh and flavorful. Veggies in the omelet taste like they were just cut. The sausage gravy was full of sausage bits and the biscuits were super light and fluffy. A great place for breakfast and really nice friendly staff. Will definitely come here next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Today was our 4th visit to US Egg in recent months, so a review is long overdue. We've always been seated promptly, in spite of a busy atmosphere. The service is very attentive and genuine. The food menu offers multiple options, whether electing to have breakfast or lunch, and the quality of the food preparation has always left us happy with our selections. We find ourselves dining here at least once a month now, depending on our schedule and proximity, as there are several locations in and around the Phoenix metropolitan area."}
{"text":"When it comes to traditional breakfast I would rather eat at home then go to IHop or Dennys, but US Egg hit the nail on the head. I love all of their food and its fresh and delicious.  Very friendly staff and great service."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new breakfast place today.   Decided on US Egg and Im happy we did.  Place was clean, service was great, food was just what I was looking for.  Staff seemed to actually care about the experience they were creating.  Food not only tasted good, the presentation was nice as well.  We will be going back soon im sure."}
{"text":"Love US Egg! Service is great and usually pretty fast. Never have to wait too long to be seated. The protein pancakes are the bomb.com! My only bug-a-boo is that some of the hostesses and waitresses wear shorts that are so short and even too small and to be honest it's a little uncomfortable. There are children around and I don't feel that it's appropriate to wears shorts that could qualify as underwear to work. It's not going to stop me from getting my protein pancakes but had to share that tid bit."}
{"text":"The absolute best breakfast for the money.  The staff is down to earth, cheerful, and overly willing to make their customers happy.  Had a Triple Play with bacon-they have the best bacon ever! As I always ask them to cook it well done and dry and it's been perfect every time.  There was a male manager when we came and he personally welcomed us at the door and checked in on us during our meal.  A terrific breakfast!"}
{"text":"The food was...food. I wasn't totally impressed. Wasn't really as wowed as I'd hoped to be based on what I'd heard. The pancakes are okay but a little bland. Sausage seemed to be akin to that brown n' serve stuff you find in the freezer aisle. The bacon was good though and the eggs were prettt good."}
{"text":"The food was great, especially the blueberry pancakes. I think we got a new waitress and she was a little chatty but did a great job at serving us."}
{"text":"We were so happy to find this delightful restaurant in the Phoenix area.  The menu is extensive and had everything we wanted for everyone in our party.  They even include gluten free options - quite a bonus.  Our waitresses could not have been nicer.  The huge pot of coffee and pitcher of water were greatly appreciated.  A wonderful place."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food.  Seated quickly.   Just a bit pricy for us for breakfast.  We are used to a little less expensive with same if not more amount of food esp at Black Bear Diner.  But good place none the less"}
{"text":"U.S Egg recently opened in the space where \"Blue Plate Brunchery\" had been....  Same menu as their other locations.  We had the Veggie Benedict, Breakfast Burrito, Biscuits and gravy, and the fruit platter...  they have just opened but everythign was good and the service was attentive.  Only complaint was that teh potatoes were undercooked, but I am not a big fan so it was no biggie..."}
{"text":"Amazing hung-over breakfasts! I love to make a special visit to this place once in awhile and enjoy a hearty breakfast. It'll keep you full all day! Do a great hike at South Mountain afterwards and you won't feel so guilty about all of that bacon. (I suggest Beverly Canyon at 48th St. & Baseline)"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food and efficient service at this restaurant. I go there for breakfast frequently. This Saturday morning was a great example. I drove up and noticed quite a few people standing outside. Normally that's a sign that there'll be a wait. I went in, gave my name and took a seat. The influx of people was steady, but after a 10 minute wait I was seated. My breakfast of biscuits and gravy was excellent! It was hot and still steaming, plus the reataurant was packed. I highly recommend U S Egg!"}
{"text":"Breakfast and staff are great and restaurant accommodates special needs. Frittata was especially good with very fresh ingredients. A bit pricier than I expected. To me an average entree of $12.00 was higher than similar restaurants. I will go again sometime."}
{"text":"First time here cause i thought it was a gourmet place. Had a meat skillet, GF had spinach, mushroom omelet. Minus one star cause my eggs were a little well. Other than that my mouth is watering anticipating a return visit."}
{"text":"Food was great. Nice service.  Quick kitchen. It isn't as cheap as some breakfast places but the food is a step up.  Not greasy."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but they raised their prices AGAIN. The food is good, but lots of places have good food and all of them are cheaper for breakfast than US Egg is now. Expect to pay $14-$16 per person for breakfast and cup of coffee. Boo. The bottom line, it's not worth what they're charging."}
{"text":"We left for IHOP and ended up at US Egg.  I made the suggestion because, in all honestly, I don't care much for IHOP and I'm always looking to try something new.  US Egg was neat and tidy and offered a decent menu selection.  They offer traditional diner fare with more healthy eating selections.  I don't eat healthy so that means nothing to me.  If your a person that counts calories, you just may find something on the US Egg menu to suit your fancy.  I ordered the Texas omelette.  There was nothing striking about it in taste.  Good but nothing really sticks out over other places.  A big strike against my overall satisfaction was lack of pancakes served with omelettes.  Every place that I have been to for breakfast includes a stack of 2 or 3 pancakes with all omelette selections.  For the same price of other joints I received less food and the quality was just the same.  The waitress also failed the one test I will hold to any server: no refills on my drink.  I will never hold meal quality against my server as it's out of their control but I do expect them to do what they can.  I don't want to ask for refills on my beverage.  Asking the customer if they desire a refill is a standard practice.  It's the one thing that can keep me happy even if I am left unsatisfied with my meal.  Take US Egg or leave it.  It's not a place I'd venture out of my way for but it's good enough that I'd drop by again if in the area."}
{"text":"Always a GREAT breakfast. Tried my hash browns deep fried. Really tasty and more like fries. Always friendly peeps including Jason at the check-in podium."}
{"text":"We love the protein pancake and the traditional breakfast.  The extensive menu will fill the needs of any diner.   The servers are professional and friendly and accommodate any special needs  Great place"}
{"text":"Stopped by this location of US Egg while on a trip to Arizona.  The name and Yelp reviews are what brought us in. Even though they were busy, the food was served quickly and was great. The staff was very courteous and friendly.  I tried one of their Hot Skillets and throughly enjoyed it. The wife had the Country Fried Steak which was very good as well.  When we are back in the area we will return."}
{"text":"Best American breakfast I've had in ages!!!  I ordered 2 eggs over-easy, four strips of bacon, two pieces of gluten-free toast, and a fruit dish.  Everything was perfect!  The fruit was fresh and flavorful, bacon delicious, eggs perfect, and bread was well, gluten-free.  I loved my breakfast!  Loud resteraunt, packed, but good service."}
{"text":"Always great... Thank you Mario for all the great service.  The wait can be a little long on the weekends because of the great food..so bring a book and some patients."}
{"text":"The food was terrible all of our silverware were dirty and even the coffee was terrible.  The people were very very nice though that is the only reason I gave this place even 1 star."}
{"text":"I had a cheese omelet with spinach and bacon-maybe a bit too much bacon in it.  Good food but pricey-15.00 for omelet and coffee and no juice? They need some specials-"}
{"text":"The place is nice but the food isn't on par. We ordered the Sante for skillet and The country fried steak. The Sante Fe skillet was initially served less than warm. On letting them know the food isn't hot they heated it and served it back. The taste wasn't too good too.  Pricing is same as any place like IHOP which is not too cheap and yet we didn't fancy the food."}
{"text":"Since this was a little local spot I always passed, I decided to give it a try one day. The décor is so beyond needing an update, it needs a complete makeover. If you had Mr. Ramsey visit, he would say, \"Oh God...what were you thinking\". The location is great and I think that the restaurant has potential to do better than it is. The prices were about average in comparison to other breakfast restaurants in the area and the menu had a wide selection of breakfast goodies. The food was extremely average...I would have to compare it to the quality and creativity of Denny's. Nothing special, and for $30.00 for breakfast for two...I would not go back. There are so many great restaurants in the area and I like to support local business but this place just needs to start from scratch to make it great."}
{"text":"DONT JUDGE ME..  at 630am we went to try this breakfast spot out and OMG we had a great breakfast. I placed a breakfast order and when that arrived I tasted it and then the 2nd order I placed.  Was the peanut butter Fried sandwich.  Let me just say.  Eweeeeee gowwwww my mind away.  I never touched my 1st order breakfast again.  I ate the entire fried sandwich for breakfast at 630am..  help me my body is in heaven.  #alwaysstepoutyourbox"}
{"text":"This is my first time going here didn't know what to expect but I was happily surprised to find that the food and the services was excellent I had bacon & eggs and the wheat pancakes best I ever had. I would go back and try some other item on there menu. Love this place."}
{"text":"The prices at this establishment are a bit high.  Today I asked to have a protein pancake added to my yogurt parfait and was shocked when the bill arrived...$6.99 for one pancake. It was a large pancake, but $6.99 is highway robbery. Will not go here again."}
{"text":"Food comes in large portions. I like the fact that they leave a coffee pitcher and at water pitcher on the table for quick refills. Service is good. Food is good Breakfast food."}
{"text":"We came here Sunday after Church.  There was a 20 to 25 min. wait.   Not bad for a Sunday morning.  If you are a dog lover you can eat outside with your dog on the patio, which is very nice. We got a seat inside and had very quick service. Coffee was very good and they brought us water with lemon.  Now for the food. I got California Eggs Benedict. Was supposed to have hollandaise sauce on top.  It was some type of Canned Cheese sauce.  Horrible, they totally killed it!   My BF,got The Protein  Pancakes ,they are good, if we go back i will get those. Don't get anything with the Hollandaise sauce. They also did not toast the English muffins."}
{"text":"Always seated fast, great and funny servers, they give you a pitcher of water, and the food is bomb diggety."}
{"text":"I was disapointed in the breakfast served at my hotel, so went yelping for an alternative.  USE is definitely worth the bit of a drive to get there!  I got the half and half combo of protein pancakes and Santa Fe skillet.  If those are \"small\" pancakes, the regular ones must be huge!  The skillet was a bit different style than I've had before, with the egg on top rather than scrambled in, but it works.   The service was very good too.  Definitely one to remember!"}
{"text":"Poor service and marginal food.  Wait was short but we were seated at a table with food on the chairs and ice in the floor. Our table was served half our food with a promise the rest was on it's way. Another 5 minutes and we still didn't have it all. My husband said 'it was the weirdest pancake ever'. My skillet have soggy frozen hash browns on the bottom. We had to ask for salsa twice. Same for more cream for our coffee. With so many good places in the area, this one is not a repeat."}
{"text":"There was a normal busy Sunday morning crowd today. We expected the wait to be a lot longer than the 10 minutes it actually was. Love the new open dining area. We had the French toast and Denver omelette. Both were great. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"PROTEIN PANCAKES!  That's really all I need to say. I don't care if the service is bad, the tables are dirty or the coffee is watery. Their pancakes are worth an hour wait and a grumpy server."}
{"text":"Food was ok here but there are other breakfast places around that are better. Our server sucked. We had Jamie.  She walked by our table 5 times sense we got our food and didn't stop to ask how it was and then another 4 times when we were trying to pay. It took more time waiting for this then it took them to cook our meal or us to eat it."}
{"text":"With 6 locations in the Greater Phoenix area, makes US Egg a great stop no matter where you live in AZ, but the this Location is my fave!  Love that they are family owned, it shows in there food and service!  If you are the type to have a Bloody Mary for breakfast...US Egg has it down. Try the EYE OPENER it's a must and a new fave!  Everyone knows I am a Eggs Benedict fanatic and US Egg Restaurant has a few good choices. The California Benedict is a great choice with a spin on a classic!  The Food...Let's Get It On! A new staple for one of the Reilly boys is the Half & Half. A great way of getting your pancake fix and half the Meat Skillet!  Did someone say MEAT...OOH YEAH! The Idaho Meat Lovers Hot Skillet is everything you could imagine for one of the Heartiest breakfasts out there. Loaded with Bacon, Sausage, Ham, Hash Browns, Two Eggs, Melted Cheese. Topped with a Chicken Fried Steak and Smothered in Home Made Gravy, makes this MY Choice!  Great Food and AWESOME Service makes this a great stop for Breakfast-Brunch!"}
{"text":"Not the same as the Chandler location. I just paid $36 for cold food and the waitress not listening to my order so charged me extra. I said something she just said oh well we can't substitute, if she would have said that when I would have ordered  separately instead of paying for cold food I didn't even get to eat."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE U.S. Egg!! They are always welcoming, friendly and attentive whether I'm grabbing food on the run or have a few minutes to take a load off and dine with friends. I'm a bit of a \"healthy eater\" and I'm known for being the \"I would like this, but...\" And U.S. Egg has always delivered, no matter the many odd requests I've made. Things like swapping out a certain type of bread for another or making a 2-egg, instead of the traditional 3-egg omelet. Not to mention that the portions are always plentiful and arrive hot/cold (depending on the items) and are perfectly plated and presented when it comes to the table. And I cannot tell you how much I absolutely LOVE their protein pancakes!! Are you kidding me with these things, they are simply awesome! Enough said.. They were my livelihood during the Lenten season (this is when you must abstain from eating meat on Friday's), the protein cakes fit the bill perfectly! So, if you're looking for extensive menu choices, friendly and accommodating staff, then the U.S. Egg should be your next venture."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I get the triple play every week with my girlfriend. It's our Saturday tradition!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food. Friendly, efficient service. Just passing through town but it was a great treat."}
{"text":"Here's how our first time at US Egg went: Greeted with an attitude, Burnt toast, microwaved sausage, greasy potatoes, slow service....We won't be back"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and their food is consistant.  I had the protein pancakes and bacon both times.  The pancakes are really good!  The menu is pretty basic and the inside is ok.  Staff was friendly.  I would probably go more often for the protein pancakes if it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"I mean it's a typical breakfast-y diner. It's pricey for what you get. I've had some of their breakfast and lunch foods. The breakfast is usually decent, everything just kind of has a greasy taste to it, which is kind of to be expected. When they serve their accompaniments with their burgers, the tomatoes are kind of unripe. The coleslaw the other day was brown and hardly dressed. I'd rather go to IHOP than here but it's not horrible."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast and lunch. Clean and fresh decor, nice staff, good coffee. Tad expensive for diner, but meh it was delish so!"}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday with my family for breakfast. Service was amazing and food was fast and so delicious.  I will spread the word about this gem!"}
{"text":"Whats not to love about a breakfast place thats always crowded every weekend? For starters i have to say DO try their protein pancakes.....they are out of this world, and their skillets are almost as good as mine...but thats another story. We only had to wait about 10 minutes, which was good considering the amount of people they had in there. The service was quick and pleasant.  I know consider myself a US egghead!"}
{"text":"I think this was the worst place I have ever eaten in terms of money/quality. Their coffee is just brown water with no taste of actual coffee. It was rather disgusting. I was more than disappointed by that. The food was too bland to be able to eat without adding some extra spices and hot sauces. My freshly squeezed juice was brought in within 2 minutes. Really?  There was no pulps no nothing indicating that the juice was indeed freshly squeezed. I am really surprised that the place has such a high rating. I paid about $20 dollars for something I'd rather had not eaten."}
{"text":"Service: Very good. Both times I've been here we were promptly seated and constantly checked on. If you order a water or iced tea they bring you a glass and leave the pitcher! For sodas they bring two! The food also came out very quickly. Food: Very good. I've had the signature protein pancakes and the choco-nana (I think) pancakes. The former are good; The flavor reminds me of granola. The later was fantastic and will probably lead to an early death. It is chocolate chip and banana pancakes with a big ball of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup on top. Fantastic. All the portions are HUGE so come hungry. Price: Reasonable. You definitely get what you pay for, and some. Appearance/Location: Let's be honest, the place isn't going to win any style awards, but it is open, bright, and clean. I don't go to restaurants to look at wall art anyway. It is in a great location with a lot of other food and shopping. Bottom Line: A great joint for breakfast with tons of great food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's bad luck or what, but every time I come here I always get very bad service from the waiting staff. Every time that I have come with one of my friends, it has been pretty empty in the restaurant. Yet still, we have waited almost 20 minutes to even get greeted by a server and even longer for drink refills. The server that we get either doesn't care enough to provide even the minimum amount of good customer service (and I am not a picky, mean, or difficult diner whatsoever) or they take our plates away before we even finish our food. It's very weird and awkward to say the least. Almost embarrassing since we have never had a bad experience with the food thus far.  For example, the other day when my friend and I were dining in for breakfast, we waited about 15 mins for a server to come greet us in an almost empty restaurant. Meanwhile, the waiting staff was laughing and gossiping up front instead of actually checking to see if anyone needs help or how their experience is. A random server/manager/whatever that works there decided to come ask us what we wanted to drink, and that our actual server would be right over. When he comes back with the drinks, our server just shows up and asks us if we are ready to order. NO NAME, NO GREETING, NOTHING. Her service was horrendous to say the least even after that defining moment. Surprised I even tipped for that. But I am not the type of person to stiff a waiter or waitress. Needless to say, I probably won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and horrible service. This is not so much a restaurant as it is a micro-managed conveyor belt. Granted, I went on a Saturday morning which is going to be the busiest time for any restaurant specializing in breakfast, but I do not detract any points for the 30 minutes I had to wait on line for a table. What was irksome was having to wait another 40 minutes after being seated to be served. I ordered the steak and eggs with coffee. When it was finally served 40 minutes later, the waitress had completely forgotten about my coffee. The steak looked good on the outside, but was very gristley and deeply infused with cracked pepper. I happen to like spicy food and was starving so I ate it anyway, but many would not have been able to eat it at all. I didn't make any complaints to the harried teeny bopper waitress as she was just a nervous little cog in this machine who couldn't change a thing. The meal came with bland hash browns and an English muffin. They don't ask you what kind of bread you'd like and whether you want it buttered or not. You are essentially ISSUED an English muffin! The steak and eggs are MUCH better at Denny's, where you get your choice of bread and sides and some individualized attention. Considering the price difference, how depressing is that?   If only Arizonans could eat in a typical Greek Diner in the northeast or mid-Atlantic US where I come from and see what it's like to eat in a restaurant that puts a little soul and enthusiasm into making and serving simple meals like steak and eggs, they would know what an anemic utilitarian ripoff they're getting in places like U.S. Egg."}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast. I tried the Italy and it was awesome. The concept of pizza for breakfast can't go wrong. Great servers and super fast service. I will definitely come here whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"This is a favorite for when we are meeting friends or family for breakfast or brunch. My daughter is in love with the protein pancakes, and asks for them every time we go. I have to admit that they are particularly yummy (my husband and I will sneak bites from her). My husband always loves their scrambles or omelets. On Sunday, they do an Popeye Omelet, and I think I probably get that most visits. So many choices - you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"A customer service person reached out to me to try to resolve my last issue I had when I went in and had coffee grounds in my to-go order, and then he just stopped responding. So not only is their food/drink quality poor, apparently their customer service is terrible too!"}
{"text":"Great place and our first visit at this location.  We typically frequent the Tempe location and love it as much but this location is roomier and more modern, understandably.  As always, the staff, service and food is phenomenal!  Will always recommend either location.  Great job guys!  :-)  As I re-read this, I realize this review is for the Tempe location, but I was rating the newer Chandler location.  Carry on folks and know that both are fabulous!"}
{"text":"A more than decent breakfast spot that'll do in a pinch when we need something close by with a reliable menu and comfortable breakfast food.   We went here a couple weeks ago on our Sunday Brunch Day.  The wait is as to be expected for any breakfast joint on a weekend but not ridiculously long. Our server was pleasant and as attentive as she could be with the crowded restaurant and her numerous tables.   My dish was typical (so typical that I honestly can't remember what it was)breakfast fare and it tasted like food I could have made at home. Not a bad thing at all but sometimes when I go out for food I'm looking for some extra bang or a nice treat.   The winner here is actually their protein pancakes which my fiance ordered and I ended up stealing more than a couple bites from his plate. If we decide to go back here, that is definitely what I'll be ordering for myself."}
{"text":"Loved this place for the price, the decor, and delicious food! I got the blueberry granola whole wheat pancakes with the chorizo plate and it was so good. Coffee was good too!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and it's usually pretty packed so we order to go.  Love this place!  Best breakfast in PHX I would say."}
{"text":"The Florentine breakfast was very good. Lots of fresh spinach, bacon and mushrooms. The fruit had seven types of fruit, all good. The portions were big enough to hold you all day. The prices were fine, who doesn't wish they were lower? I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have had this review sitting in my queue for  years, but in that time... A LOT has changed.  Rewind back almost 3 years to when I first tried this place. It was alright. Protein pancakes were kinda alright, decor was similar to that of a long-term adult care facility, etc, etc etc...  Fast forward up to just over a month ago, and here we are now. My boyfriend recently moved to Tempe and his house just so happens to be a 5 minute walk from this place.  Decided to check it out one Saturday morning and they have really updated their style in all that time. Thank Gob. The food is super delish. I don't get the protein pancakes... but whatever I get is amazing. Couple of eggs, some hashies, a english muffin and some bacon.  I really enjoy it... and so does my boyfriend (who really likes ham... yuck!) ;)  There isn't much more to say than that!  Except that this place gets kind of busy on a Saturday morning. Obvs...  But they seem to hurry through the wait list and an impressive rate. Don't hate. Don't get turned off by the time, put your name in and unwind.... and get your quick (unsatisfying compared to what they actually serve inside) coffee fix at the outdoor coffee stand while you hang out!"}
{"text":"We recently had breakfast here after reading the amazing reviews. This restaurant had a lot to live up to and it delivered.   My breakfast consisted of a chicken bacon avocado skillet and half protein pancakes. Everything on my plate was flavorful and absolutely delicious! The protein pancakes were quite possibly the best pancakes I've ever had.   Not only was the food great, but we our sever was wonderful. She checked in on us multiple times and even made sure we had coffee to go.   A great place to have breakfast if you're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"A strange place this,like it was America back in 50's but I was hungry and visiting in a new town.The joint was empty bar one but the server was sweet and generous.I scoured the menu for something that wouldn't kill me and settled on the BLT with a side of sweet potato fries.The bread choice was brown or white..that was it.I nearly pissed myself laughing.The filling of my sandwich tasted okay but the bread tasted like fibreglass.How do these guys stay in business with such out of date food?I'll never know because I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Nice atmosphere. Great staff. I eat here every so often, the protein pancakes are one of my breakfast favorites! Their sausage is also very yummy, while the hash browns aren't my favorite. Their bathroom usually is in need of a little TLC."}
{"text":"Average or below average breakfast food.  Most important to know is that this is not a very good neighborhood.  Lots of shady types hanging around outside and coming into the restaurant when we were there.  And the girl at the hostess desk took forever to acknowledge that we were standing right in front of here. Won't be back."}
{"text":"One of Moon Valley's hidden treasures! Great breakfast! Friendly staff, and a great place to take your grandkids for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Another rival to my \"Good Egg\"! The service is great, the food is yummy.  I'm stuck on my \"Half & Half\": 2 Protein Pancakes, 1 Egg scrambled your way and your choice of a 1/2 order of Idaho Hot Skillet.  There is realy no reason to get anything else..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff. A little costly but the protein pancakes are worth it!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Friendly service, good range of breakfast items....well executed standard american breakfast."}
{"text":"Happy they had gluten free waffles. They were yummy! I'll be back. I'd love some chocolate chip pancakes gf, just saying..."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this breakfast spot but was really disappointed with just about every aspect of the meal. The food was bland, the glasses were small, the order was wrong, it was just not a good experience. My son even made a comment the Denny's is way better! Lol. Maybe they just cater to a certain clientele that doesn't want great food."}
{"text":"Today we had Brandi as our server.  Mario came by and talked with us.  My husband had the Half and Half with meat lovers and I have corned beef hash.  Everything was amazing.  Coffee is excellent.  Service was top notch.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite \"go to\" when staying in the area.  So many amazing menu options. Husband had The Border (chorizo skillet) and I had the Half and Half (half meat lover skillet half protein pancakes), coffee, ice tea and a fresh squeezed orange juice.  They provide you carafes of ice tea, coffee and water, so you never wait for refills.  That's a lot of food for under $35. All of it was extremely excellent and cooked exactly to order.  Service by Parker (Sarah) and others was fabulous.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I feel like the West Side gets the short end when it comes to new business. We were super excited to see a new breakfast place open up not too far from home on our side of town. The renovation converting it from the Good Egg  made it very bright, open and inviting. The portions are HUGE and I highly recommend the protein pancake although I'm still unclear why it is a \"protein\" pancake. I asked the waitress and she said, and this is a direct quote, \"It has blueberries, granola, and almonds in it, I guess it is the almond that give it all the protein.\" Well thanks, I read the menu, I understood the ingredients, but you still didn't answer my questions. Whatever, it was delicious and we'd go back and get it again. I chalk her poor product knowledge (we asked her a few other questions she couldn't answer) up to the place being new and left it at that."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great place for breakfast and lunch. It's always busy but somehow the wait for the table is never long. What I love most is, no matter what I order, it's always good. The only thing that I would change if I could, would be the seating. It's usually shoulder to shoulder."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing but this place has the friendliest staff you're going to find anywhere! If you get a chance to request Rachel or Brandi please do, they are friendly and professional. The chocolate chip pancakes are awesome, but so is everything else!"}
{"text":"Have been eating at US Egg for the past 7 years although hadn't been there within the past 3 years until recently. My mom was in town from FL and we stopped in for a late breakfast - early lunch and it reminded me how much I love this place. The food was delicious, the service was fantastic and friendly. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went to the Good Egg on Greenway & 7th St. Food was great but our server was below average. I want to point out that the service from the other employees was great! Definitely would recommend this place for the food, especially the protein pancakes! Environment is casual and friendly!"}
{"text":"Been here several times the last two months since we stumbled upon it. It's out of our way, but a change of pace from The Good Egg, our usual Saturday brunch spot.   US Egg beats Good Egg.   Why? They make waffles. And they are delicious.  They have mimosas and bloody Mary's. They had me at waffles and mimosas...  Kids French toast is a good size portion and is very good. Lots of choices/combos on the regular menu. And, they remember us. We like that."}
{"text":"No substitutions allowed for anything.  I don't eat pork and wasn't allowed to sub for anything.  Then I asked for gravy and the waitress said they don't have any.  No gravy at a breakfast joint?  Then the service wasn't good either.  I pretty much sat most of the time waiting to get silverware, or syrup.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is good! I wanted Dennys and my son wanted this So we played paper rock scissors and he won. From now on I will always pick this place over Denny. Taylor was our server and she was great."}
{"text":"Food here is very good. I had something called the half-in-half, I think, which consisted of a bacon and onion skillet and the protein pancakes. OMG THE PROTEIN PANCAKES. Seriously, these things are awesome. Made with granola and berries and all sorts of things, they are filling and tasty and everyone going to US Egg should try them.   Delicious! Service could have been a bit better, but all in, I was very pleased."}
{"text":"The service was delightful! Even when our server accidentally spilled water all over me... She was humble and kind and I was in return. Yummy food and fast! xo"}
{"text":"Everything was great! Price wasn't too bad especially since we got the chicken fried steak. We were welcomed and seated right away and the staff is very friendly. There menu is a little busy but its filled with tons of good choices. We will be back again and i would recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"Food came out fast. We were hungry. Quality of food 3.5 but the service was 5+ easily! Natalie was amazing. That service is why we would come back over and over. Many employees moving fast working hard. Bussers as well."}
{"text":"There are much better options for breakfast than this place.  The food is ok but lacked salt. So if you are going for a low sodium diet you are all set.  My first visit was fine nothing special would have given it a 3.  I would recommend not going in after 1PM.  I went in at 1:30pm and there was nobody there to seat me as they were chatting at a table off to the side.  I was seated after a few minutes, when he noticed I was waiting. The booth where I was seated didn't seem to have a waitress assigned to it...  Everyone was clearing tables and huddled in the back.  I waited 10 Minutes then decided they wanted to close so I left and went to get food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, I work down the road so I am always there getting breakfast with or for my fellow employees. Great food and one of my favorites is the Hawkeye omelette!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing; I've came here two days in a row and both times were just as amazing as the other. This is now my favorite place to get breakfast in Arizona!"}
{"text":"completely forgot about this place until just now! came here about 4 months ago. my boyfriend was running in the Rock and Roll marathon so his mom and i decided to eat breakfast here. now when we got here it was prob like 6am?? since we had to drop him off for the race, so there was really no one in the restaurant. they had a lot of ppl on staff which was good-even tho it wasnt that crowded. but prob once the breakfast rush started to come in. we both ordered the protein pancakes. now it comes with 2 but our waitress told us we could just get one since they are really big and have a lot of good stuff in them! we also ordered fruit on the side. now when she said \"big\" i was thinking like Ihop or Denny's size, but they really are BIG!! like huge. prob the size of a large dinner plate. it was really good tho, and very filling! i would def come back again to try their other food!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place around.  We were just commenting that every time we come here the service is great, the food is spectacular, and we have honestly never had a complaint.  Definitely try the protein pancakes. They are amazing!"}
{"text":"8/5/12  Checked in at door. Packed. Told 10 minutes???  Waited 20.  Left when it became apparent it would be longer. The poor reviews I was reading on Yelp at time didn't help.  Tip to hostess, be honest about wait time."}
{"text":"Good overall. Traditional breakfast done well. The \"fresh\" blueberries today were anything but fresh."}
{"text":"Ordered some breakfast for work this morning no one was there other than servers got my food fast and easy and was so good and warm when I got to work. I love how easy it was to order and fast it came out. I can not wait to try more foods especially their sandwiches for lunch"}
{"text":"We just had a great family breakfast at US Egg.  The food and service could not be better.  There were 5 of us dining today.  Everyone was very pleased.  The owner, Mario, welcomes you at the door.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"$2.50+ for lukewarm, stale tasting coffee at 6:30am added $8 on my family's tab for coffee that nobody enjoyed or finished. I can make better on my keurig for cheaper. Pumpkin protein pancakes not impressive at all. Imagine pumpkin puree mixed in with your standard protein pancakes. Pumpkin + blueberries = meh. The little jam packets at the table were sticky at 6:30 am! Nothing grosser than an improperly cleaned station from the night before. Really. US Egg has lost its charm for me. Back to the drawing board."}
{"text":"Went with the girl's book club (ie. wine club.. hehe) for brunch today.  Good thing one of the gals had made reservations for our party of 9 because this place was SUPER busy and crowded on late Sunday morning.  This is a new place to the area, so there were a lot of expectations with the new place.  Here's what went down:  Our server was a nice, young gal that seemed overwhelmed with our group - we kept having to ask her and then ask again for things like coffee, coffee mugs, creamer, pens for the check, etc.  I was baffled by their so-called coffee mugs - I swear the damn thing could only contain 5oz of coffee!!  Everytime you sipped, you had to refill.. oh, and why would you serve a table of 9 only ONE CARAFE of coffee when they're clearly drinking through that stuff and keep asking for refills?  That boggled me!  To make it worse, we realized cups of coffee were over 2 dollars each!  Really?  This was not some kind of Organic, Fair-Trade Starbucks brew, this was US Egg.. give me a break.  I had the Scottsdale Salad (yeah, I know, what a dumb name) which was actually very tasty: perfect amount of well cooked onions, apples, and chicken over Spinach.  I did see a lot of empty plates, but didn't hear too many praises, so I'm not sure what to report on that.  Overall, the service gal was nice but not very functional at her job; the food I had was tasty, plentiful, but I can't review their 'breakfast items' at this point (I may have to come again).  The place is well decorated, new, and hoppin', so I'm saying I could give it another shot .. it was not a bad experience as a whole."}
{"text":"Love this place. We waited just 10 minutes for a table on a Sunday- after we sat down a few of our friends called and wanted to join us. Our waitress Mariah was very understanding and helpful to get us another table for 2 more friends to eat with us. We were well taken care of, the food was delicious. They have a really great gluten free menu that never disappoints. I would recommend the waffles and omelettes!!! What I really enjoyed was the pitchers of soda and coffee brought to our table so we did not have to ask for a refill every 15 min since the cups are a little small. Will be back here again!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from breakfast with the family at the newest location of US Egg.  Having never been before, I was not sure what to expect.  Overall, I left a little disappointed.  I ordered the egg white garden omelet which had bell peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, and cheese.  It came with a side of hash browns and an english muffin.  The portion size was amazingly huge, but the food was a bit bland...  My hash browns and omelet didn't really taste like anything.  My dad got an avocado and jack cheese omelet and my mom got the chicken and waffles.  All of us agreed that US Egg was just okay, but there are definitely better breakfast places out there!  I felt that they sort of nickel and dime you for everything.  I asked for a side of salsa (which was small) and they were going to charge $0.75 extra for it, which I didn't think was worth it.  On the plus side the service was good and our waitress was patient while I took forever to choose my dish and asked if we wanted to-go drinks.  I suppose I might try US Egg again, but I probably wouldn't order the same thing."}
{"text":"So I returned for more caloric suicide and Nicole is super awesome. Did I say super? I said super. She's the most gracious server I've met in weeks. Thank you Nicole for topping off the coffee and delivering more calories to my table than my body can process in a month. But it's delicious, yes."}
{"text":"Really sad to see the lack of courtesy in our visit here today. The food didn't come out as it was ordered and the manager shrugged her shoulders at us when she came to the table. General staff attitude was poor."}
{"text":"We love their Protein Pancakes! They're filled will granola, berries, cinnamon and whatever magical goodness they could find. Stop looking just get the pancakes... You're welcome.   We like to go here on Saturday or Sunday mornings with the whole family. Though they are always busy it always seems like the wait is fast.  We always ask to sit on the back patio which opens up to a larger courtyard where there is plenty of room for the kids to get up from the table and run around. Also, the back patio has a ton of shade during the warmer months."}
{"text":"We came from out of town and want to find something just like this place. We were greeted by a nice guy (host) and seated within 5 min of arriving. Our waitress was right to us to get our drinks. I got a Bloody Mary and I would say it is just Ok, nothing special but only $6.  We ordered and everything came out correct, timely and hot. The chicken fried steak was very good and still crispy under the gravy. An omelette called New Yorker (I think) was very good also. The chicken was still moist and the spinach was cooked just right. Everything overall was very good and we were all pleased. 4 people and 1- Bloody Mary with tip was $54.00  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has a pretty good breakfast. Some friends flew in from Portland and after a long evening the night before we were looking for a place to lick our wounds and kick the morning off (I guess it was actually afternoon). Of course a hair-of-the-dog was in order and most places that had drinks were no longer serving breakfast, and the places that had breakfast didn't have drinks. So when U.S. Egg popped up on yelp as a good place for breakfast and served alcohol we were sold. Limited bar menu (no actual bar), but a couple Bloody Mary's and Greyhounds on the patio was exactly what we all needed. Food was pretty good, and we realized it's only a few blocks from Turf Paradise! So in closing, good breakfast served in the afternoon, limited but what we needed bar menu, and close to the ponies... umm, yes please!  -Rich"}
{"text":"Went to U.S. Egg for breakfast and I have to say it was better than I expected. I had coffee (so-so) and the protein pancakes with the ham and sausage scramble. The pancakes were AWESOME! I'm in love:) I must have the recipe!!! Anyone know it??? The service was also great. There was ample staff and everyone was helpful and friendly. I will hit this place again! MUST HAVE MORE PANCAKES!"}
{"text":"I'm a little bummed after reading the other reviews on here.... my experiences with U.S. Egg haven't been nearly as great. The food is alright, but nothing particularly special... and I've found the service (while pleasant) to be awfully slow.  Maybe I'll have to give it another go... hopefully I just caught it on an \"off\" day."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend had a horrible time trying to find a breakfast place. We like to try new things. We were so happy to find this place. Its amazing. It might not look like much on the outside but believe me you will be happy once inside. Me and my boyfriend got an amazing booth in a private corner. The staff made sure we were taken care of. The apple juice is real apple juice not from concentrate the food was amazing. I couldn't believe the options either. I strongly recommend the stars and stripes waffle. Freshly made huge waffle with strawberries and blue berries along with whip cream. Even better they arranged all of this into a flag looking thing. You'd be stupid not to go!  I went in again today 5/16. With my dad the manger greeted me by my name and shook my dads hand. He kept coming over to talk to us and he was a hoot! He even gave us a free protein pancake big enough for two!! It was amazing."}
{"text":"As the name implies, this places specializes in breakfast, though they're also open for lunch. Don't be fooled by the 3-star rating. The food was excellent, but it's hard to screw up breakfast. The portions are HUGE! I got the meat lovers skillet, which is enough food for 3 people!  Clean restaurant, fast service, and way better than Denny's!"}
{"text":"There is really no great places to eat breakfast in Phoenix for what I like - which are breakfast burritos.  I had the breakfast burrito at U.S. Egg - and it was good, but I would have to advise them to make it a tad different, maybe with more green chili.  However, I really do like this place.  It's next door to me.  When I walk in - I am greeted by this lovely hostess (who was wearing a birthday hat) and another nice guy who must be the owner/manager.  They typically hand me a menu and I venture over to the counter.  I always eat there alone.  The wait staff there are all women and all incredibly nice.  I like how they bring you an entire PITCHER of water and COFFEE.  The pancakes are the best in town and the eggs benedict are nothing to snicker at either!!"}
{"text":"Great service, a moderately priced, very solid menu of favorites and a casual dining atmosphere.  The protein pancakes are a great twist on a standard and decent coffee to boot!"}
{"text":"First time here and was impressed. Friendly service and even better food. I got the half and half Idaho skillet which was the perfect amount of food with the protein pancakes which were some of the best pancakes I have ever had! Only complaint would be it only came with one egg, which I guess is why ya called U.S. Egg not Eggs... I will be coming back many times!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed U.S. Egg!  The staff were friendly and courteous and everything came out quickly and correct.  It was delicious!  I really appreciated that they had egg-white options for omelettes and mine tasted great.  My mom got a benedict which looked incredible.  The restaurant is clean and very nicely decorated, the egg map of the U.S. was so cool!  The only slight down side was that the main room is very echo-y so it gets a little loud in there."}
{"text":"Definitely the best breakfast in town! The protein pancakes are amazing and along side 1/2 skillet they make a perfect breakfast!  The crew at US Egg are always friendly and professional and even when they're busy, we never have to wait for service or refills. Top notch and good people!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have come here 2 other times since it is right next to where we live. Now I remember why we drive 5 miles to another place. I ordered the Western Scramble and it was so bland. The eggs were flat, the veggies in it were raw leaving a overpowering 'green' taste from the peppers. And the portions were ridiculous. Way too much food. It was sad to see such a waste. Even though it's a 2 minute walk, I think we will just keep walking by next time."}
{"text":"fav breakfast or lunch spot... green chili sauce is on point and protein pancake is the bees knees!!!! highly recommended! customer service is A+++++"}
{"text":"This place has perfected omelets and they are not difficult when you want to substitute or make add bacon and cheese to a veggie omelette. Never disappointed and love the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Service has always been great!"}
{"text":"Just a step up from an IHOP or Perkins. Their \"protein pancakes\" have very little protein & they give you MARGARINE instead of butter unless you ask. Overall, ok but overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"It's worth trying.  Unpretentious, Great RXP080142Easy going atmosphere, but more importantly Good Food at a Good Vale.  I recommend the Half and Half."}
{"text":"I don't come here too often but am normally pleased with the outcome.  Service and food was pretty good!    Egg and cheese omelet: love that they asked if I wanted jack cheese with cheddar before they served it! Bacon was perfectly cooked and not greasy at all. Hash browns - yummy and salted we'll.  Important-not greasy! All in all a win!"}
{"text":"Friendly and accommodating. I dined here with my four young children and the booths are large enough for three adults to comfortably fit. The menu is fantastic and the service was great. Will return on weekends."}
{"text":"We have eaten here  4 or 5 times and the service is always friendly the food is way fresh and hot and the price is right. My husband is picky too and he loves it here."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite breakfast spot!   The staff is great, always super friendly! And the food is awesome, serving sizes are plenty big enough and we always have left overs.   We have yet to visit on a weekend morning, so I'm not sure wait time then but during the week we always have fast and friendly service!   5 stars, thanks U.S. EGG!"}
{"text":"Perfect for what it is, great breakfast and service! Fresh food, good coffee and easy in and out. Lots of choices on the menu for breakfast and lunch. Best place in the area."}
{"text":"I really like walking over here for breakfast. The servers are incredibly friendly as are the other employees. Everything from the service to the food is wonderfully consistent.   The menu is gigantic, but I almost always order the cali benny. They make some of the best hollandaise I've ever had, and I really like how the tomatoes are prepared.  I think maybe they roast them in the oven? It's a unique touch that really brings out more flavor in the dish.   The biscuits and gravy are also delicious. Yummy savory gravy and buttery pillowy biscuits.  Breakfast comfort food elevated the perfect amount."}
{"text":"Great food and lots of it. Biscuits and gravy was great and lots of them and eggs. Great service and nice people."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, priced a little high, and the coffee is horrible. They need a light breakfast blend instead of the sludge."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Coffee is a darker brew. Very fresh food and ingredients. Local breakfast joint feel."}
{"text":"Awesome service, quick wait time, delicious Bloody Mary plus the food was delicious. Will definitely be coming back here. Plus I think the decor is adorable! Definitely a great breakfast place"}
{"text":"In an attempt to branch out on our Sunday afternoon breakfasts my peeps and I decided to eat here. I was the only first timer.   It was ok, but pretty expensive, $15, for what it was. I ordered the Arizona Fritatta. Lots of veggies in an omelet with cheese, sour cream, and salsa served with potatoes and an english muffin. The fritatta was nice, the potatoes were horrible, no flavor and cold.   The service left a bit to be desired. We had to ask a random busser to bring us ketchup, jam, and syrup.   I'd give them another shot, but it was just ok."}
{"text":"My family stayed at the hotel next door for a week on vacation and when we saw this restaurant we wanted to try it. Being from the Midwest, we are accustomed to huge portions of food. So when our order came, we were concerned that it may not be enough. But surprisingly, it was just right. US EGG became our go to place.  We tried other places in the area but they were so-so and ok.  We definitely preferred US EGG.  Now, we are back home and been to our regular breakfast place a couple of times and realized that the huge portions are overwhelming and end up feeling heavy and slow. We may have to find another place for breakfast now and I don't mean that in a bad way.  BTW, the protein pancakes are awesome!  I'm a fan now!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. My love and I will be returning. The biscuits and gravy are amazing. There was a wait and we still got sat very quickly. The server was awesome and took great care of us. She checked on us but wasn't over checking on us, which I love. Can't wait to come here again and try the mimosa."}
{"text":"Very cute breakfast spot. Good food. Prices were a little high on somethings but average on others. Like oatmeal was almost $5 but a kids full breakfast was the same price. I had a breakfast sandwich which was delightful.  Though the hash browns were cokd and tasteless.  My husband had the California Benedict which he said was wonderful and he ate it all. I will definitely return on my next trip."}
{"text":"Wow absolutely the best breakfast by far. Really good pancakes, I also got the huevos rancheros. Oh emm Gee...very tasty and delis hours at a good price. Good atmosphere and very friendly servers! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  They have a ton of waitresses running around to help you.  Good food.  Decent prices.  Great atmosphere.     Give them a try or keep coming back like us."}
{"text":"First time I been to this restraunt. I've always been to an IHOP or Dennys and was expecting something similar. But i learned they a few other restraunts in the area. The food was great I ordered a huevos rancheros, the whole plate was good the food wasn't so greasy. I'd definenlty go back again and recommended this spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"Not great but not bad. Went here with some friends for breakfast after we found out our first choice restaurant was closed on Mondays (bummer). This location is quite big inside and was very slow on a Monday morning. This was perfect for our needs since our service was fast - food came out quickly! Everyone was very nice.   I have to eat gluten free (Celiac), and I didn't do much research on this place before I came (like I said it was a last minute decision). So to be safe, I ordered 2 scrambled eggs, side of bacon, and side of fruit. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the sides! I got 4 big pieces of bacon and a mound of fruit! The eggs were bland, but that's how I ordered them. They were cooked well though. As I was leaving, I noticed a sign that said they are now serving gluten free pancakes and waffles!! Bummer I didn't notice it before or else I may have tried them. Can't comment to how they taste.   My friends got non-gluten free protein pancakes, apple cinnamon pancakes, and french toast. They said everything tasted good. This place isn't going to knock your socks off for breakfast/brunch, but we didn't leave disappointed either. The pancakes are BIG!! It comes with 2 large pancakes (the size of the plate). You could easily share that and another egg dish between 2 people."}
{"text":"Fast service, hot food, beautiful presentation! Loved the egg's benedict california style."}
{"text":"This place is clean and very friendly, we didn't order the pancakes, but after the waitress found out this was the first time. Some other person came and gave us a pancake to try and it was delicious. Very friendly from the front desk to the end of or meal. The waitress even asked if we wanted coffee to go. Will come back with our dog and eat on patio. Ask if that was ok and they said yes. Happy happy happy"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here either by myself or with a friend. I love the biscuits and gravy, but everything I've had from here has been wonderful. The staff are all very friendly,  especially the manager. They'll definitely be getting more business from me!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast. They serve their sandwiches for breakfast and lunch which is good because i like eating turkey for my breakfast. Service is amazing waiters are very friendly and food is so filling! I would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"YUMMY Our waitresses Brittany was the BEST!!! The half&half was delicious!!!! She made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, great quality and lots of choices. If you get the opportunity to go to this location, ask to sit in Savannah's section. She's an absolute pleasure!"}
{"text":"This is a place for my breakfast in the morning on the way to work. The eggs with grill potatoes were my favorite when I stopped by for breakfast! The order always come on a minute Ht and delicious ! I truly come back here for more, and I highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A little more then I usually spend on breakfast but the food quality is excellentand so is the service!"}
{"text":"We ended up coming to U.S. Egg this morning because our other breakfast spot wasn't open. The atmosphere on the inside is quite noisy and reminds me of a nicer version of an IHOP. The seating was park bench style wooden slat mini-booths. I wasn't impressed as they are a bit uncomfortable.   The menu looked promising. There is plenty of variety, from omelets to waffles to specialty items. I chose the frittata which was disappointing. The eggs were over cooked, the veggies were undercooked, and the side of salsa was swimming in salt. My fiancé had a simple American cheese omelet which he said was good. Both dishes came with hash browns and an English muffin. The hash browns were flavorless and had an odd texture but the English muffin was a nice change from toast. The coffee was nothing special, it almost tasted as if it was a watered down brew.  On a positive .... the food comes out quick, it's clean, and the staff were all pretty nice.   I don't want to be overly critical since it was my first time attempting to grab breakfast at this establishment. Unfortunately, I doubt I will return. There wasn't anything special about the place. Everything on the menu  could be made at home and made to have more flavor."}
{"text":"So sorry this is late, but in Az sometimes the restaurants are average and the service sometimes is terrible when the staff don't want to serve you.  Anyway I was here with my family and the two little ones were a little terrible. Just wanted to commend the staff of their patience. Oh and the food was really good. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We've been to this location many times over the past year; we've always enjoyed the friendly service and good food, when made as ordered. Often times, though, the food hasn't arrived as ordered, and we send it back. Never has anyone ever approached us upset about it; in fact, last time someone even kindly brought us a plate of fruit to munch on while waiting for the corrected entree (we didn't ask for this). We never complain, never ask to speak with the manager, nor do we ever request our bill to be adjusted. However, today when we entered the head manager, before seating us, said he wanted to have a conversation with us. He told us they didn't want to waste food. We said, \"alright, then we'll go elsewhere.\" He responded with alright. We were flabbergasted, shocked, and hurt. We still are. We never had this happen to us nor heard of it happening to anyone, anywhere - it feels as if we were refused service because we like to eat our food as ordered."}
{"text":"Love the food here!  Especially the protein pancake it is delicious. I could eat it every day. The half and half is a perfect combo and great to share, it is a lot of food! We pretty much always make US Egg our breakfast spot. They service is quick!"}
{"text":"Great food -- the skillets, protein pancakes and omelettes are among the best. Service is good -- they help each other out and know their menu well. I'd highly recommend it. It gets busy on the weekends but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Last couple times were not good.  Service was slower than usual and food wasnt as good as it usually is.  I dont like the coffee here at all.  Each time I get it by accident I tell my husband please remind me next time that I do not like their coffee and not to get it.  I wish they would serve something nicer like Douwe Eggberts (same coffee they serve at Crackers)  This last visit our waitress brought us HOT chocolate for our 4 year old in a spill able Styrofoam cup which she also put a straw in.  Thankfully my husband took a sip to test it first and burned his flipping mouth off.  I am sure the girl was too young to realize what a mistake that was but come on lets have a little common sense.  Would have been much better to bring in the mug it comes in and to let us know it was very hot and of course you wouldnt put a straw into it.  The time before this we waited forever for our food it was almost 40 minutes.  Not sure if I already reviewed that time but it was horrible.  They didnt even put cheese in my omelette.  We used to be regulars but fugget about it."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and lunch.  Love the food and service.  The owner Mario is super nice!"}
{"text":"So good. Oh so good. So good for a hangover, or, so good for brunch with mom. Quaint little establishment with cute little waitresses bouncing around in tiny little shorts. My coffee cup was never empty, and even as I was leaving, my waitress was filling up my to-go coffee cup..  she gets my vote for the most wonderful person of the day. Their breakfast menu was pretty excellent, I got the Western scramble with mushrooms and it was cheesy delicious excellence. Very clean, and lots of seating.. I had read about the lines, but we got right in and right out. This place is exactly like The Good Egg.. but not as many senior citizens or bonnet wearing geese used as the decor.. I am a fan."}
{"text":"Could only say yum and that'd be enough. Great food, big portions (you could easily share with someone), great service! Will find plenty of excuses to come up to Phoenix for Bfast!"}
{"text":"Have always loved US Egg as we used to go to the original on Baseline back in the day, before there were several locations. The food is always good and the portions decent, but the prices seem high, especially for any substitutions. Avocado is almost $4 bucks and their gluten free options are very limited and not very impressive. They have GF waffles, but not pancakes, which is interesting. (and the waffles are small)   Would I come back, yes but would I choose US Egg over the Breakfast Joint in North Scottsdale or Butters in Scottsdale, Unfortunately No. Both of those places just have amazing GF pancakes and they don't overcharge for the option."}
{"text":"Best protein pancakes! i ALWAYS get the half and half (chicken, bacon, avocado skillet) with protein pancakes! AMAZING every time!!!"}
{"text":"Nice hot awesome breakfast as always. Waitress was awesome.  Food is always delicious, never before have had incorrect orders.  You will defiently get your monies worth and delicous wholesome food, in a clean friendly atmosphere.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love US Egg because it's not Denny's. Service is good, and it's pretty packed for breakfast on weekends. Their unlimited black coffee is OK - not outstanding but that's typical for a diner.  What I really enjoyed was the protein pancakes dish - plus some sugar free syrup! Great option for when you are cutting, but still want to eat out for breakfast with friends.  The decor is pretty cute. It's pretty much your average diner, so don't expect anything bougie. (But still nicer than say.. Denny's!!)  Waitresses are nice ladies. They can get quite busy so you may have to follow up once or twice.. Still, they are very sweet.  Menu isn't crazy, and price is OK. If you want a fancier brunch I say go to Snooze or something, but if you aren't looking for something \"trendy\" then this will hit the spot!  Plus, I love the location since it's so close to home. :)  There's a patio in case you want to bring your furry friends to breakfast, as well."}
{"text":"I was here on a Sat morning for a pick up order.  It was a right move on my part since the line was so long outside!  I went in to place my order and it took around 15min.  Everyone was very helpful and friendly.    *Protein Pancake - yummy.  You can taste so many things in the pancakes  like blueberries.  *California Benedict - It was good.  English muffin with avocados, tomatoes, bacon and poached egg with hollandaise sauce.  I've made something very similar before but what made this dish special was the poached egg.  It was PERFECT.  *Service = very good.    *Food = yummy *Price = average.  $15 total *Ambiance = a little iHop-ish but in a good way :)"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Protein pancake was delicious and huge. Very satisfied. Definitely stop here again when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This US Egg location is fantastic! It has a bright and happy ambiance along with a terrific menu! The people were friendly, the food was delicious and the prices were fair. They are extremely efficient - if there is a wait - it won't be for long.  I recommend this restaurant to all of my family & friends! A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this U.S. Egg for 3 years - usually for breakfast. They have the best omelettes, decent prices and a friendly, efficient staff. There can be a 10-15 minute wait but it's worth it... Solid!"}
{"text":"Food had absolutely no taste and prices are way too inflated.  $3.00 for a coffee??  One protein waffle is $10, what is it made out of? Gold?? Will never go back to a US Egg."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my daughter after getting here for college.  One of best breakfast places I have been to especially.  Protein Waffle with blueberries, granola and sliced nuts was very good.   Service was quite good too."}
{"text":"I went to the Tempe location and again it was in a strip mall.  Seems like all restaurants in Phoenix are in a strip mall.    I was seated right away.  One quirk that I noticed is they cannot serve alcohol on their outside patio due to a Phoenix law.  I found that curious.  My server kept staring at me like I had two heads that morning. I ordered the Sonora burrito that came with hash browns.  I had to ask twice to get the ketchup and it was brought in a small metal container.  Why can't I have a ketchup bottle?  The hashbrowns were not cooked all the way through and were kind of gross.  The burrito was tasty but they didn't give enough sour cream to go with it.  Later on either the chilis or the chorizo got me.  So that put me out of commission for a bit.  If I lived in Phoenix I might give them another try."}
{"text":"I arrived to U.S. Egg to meet a group of friends, however I was pretty late. By the time I had arrived, most everyone in the group had already started in on their food. Luckily for me, the wait staff was fantastic - even though they were pretty busy, they rushed my food (the delicious Santa Fe skillet) to the table. Within 10 minutes or so, I was diving into my skillet while enjoying the company of my friends in a fun, energetic environment. Great service, great food, and great atmosphere for any breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and use Yelp to find places to eat.  This experience was disappointing.  The food was ok and service wasn't bad but certainly not 4/5 stars.  The avocado I ordered with my omelet was inside the omelet, mashed up and hot (it usually comes on the side nice and fresh).  The fruit wasn't all that great for having to pay extra to substitute fruit.  The worst part was that I arrived quite early so hardly anyone was here but it still took ages to get coffee and water while I was sitting at a table by the door with 5x staff standing around the front desk doing nothing.  I finally had to ask one of them if I could get some water.  Not a bad place but certainly not great."}
{"text":"The owner, Mario, (for lack of better wording) sucks. He is rude and assumes the worst from people. That being said, good place to enjoy food, but I'll never go back because of the way he treated me and other people. All he cares about is money."}
{"text":"The service was horrible.  Couldn't even finish my breakfast because I couldn't get a drink refill to save my life.  Waitress came back one time only right after my food was delivered.  After that, didn't see her one time and had to flag the hostess down to get my check.  Sat there for 10 minutes with my plate pushed in the middle of the table with my napkin covering it.  Obviously I was done and even had my credit card sitting out.  Just when I was thinking I just had a bad waitress - 3 bus boys walked by and no one cleared my plate.  In fact, 2 empty glasses sat there throughout my entire meal (the one refill I did get).  There were people waiting, yet the host who was 10 feet away from me couldn't pick up on the clues that I was ready to go and getting irritated.  This tells me that the service problem is bigger than one waitress.  Perhaps this is a management problem.  The food was in no way worth $12.84.  This was my first and last visit to this restaurant.  Big thumbs down!"}
{"text":"I totally love the Protein pancakes. There's lots of berries, almonds and oatmeal in it. There's on a plate which is just too much food, get just one pancake. Oh and a side of the turkey sausage. Get a half order of that too as the portions are HUGE. The service is great, everyone is quick to provide coffee in the A.M."}
{"text":"Doesn't get better than Veggie Benedict.  A solid menu with a kinds of fresh made options.  Fast, friendly service and Arizona family owned."}
{"text":"This is pretty hard for me to write as I love the company and the food you guys make.  I've been eating at your Tempe location since the late 90's grew up in the area and enjoyed what you guys have brought to the neighborhood.  The lack of customer service is weird because it's usually on point but it might be the server we had she was very lacking in the detail and ability to have any patience with those in our party pulling a answer from her on dishes was like pulling teeth and shocked me.  Your management was very helpful as there was a leak by one of the lights dripping into my child's food to which they replaced his meal but the server herself was very bad not very personable and it was like she had better things to do then take our order or wait on us.  I'm leaving 3 stars because I feel that this was maybe a off day we drive from Santan just to enjoy food."}
{"text":"Great service and an extensive menu of breakfast options. I usually don't like to go out for breakfast; it always feels like a rip-off compared to what I can do at home for a quarter of the price, but this is a nice option if you are feeling lazy. Decor is a bit odd, but people seem to like it. Better than a national breakfast-spot chain, anyway."}
{"text":"Been a favorite breakfast spot for many years now, this location and the one on 7th St and Greenway Pkway. Great waffles, my go to is always their Half and Half, which is two smaller sized protein pancakes and the scramble of my choice. The service has never let me down, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Serves great breakfast, and fast friendly service!"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and we only had to wait 2 minutes before being seated.  However, our food took a long time to come out as well as our check.  The hash browns were white, not cooked enough, and far from crispy.  They were gross and bland, but I ate some because I was hungry.  The English muffin was yummy.  The omlette was NOT tasty.  The ingredients weren't cooked into the egg, rather the egg was cooked, folded then the garden veggies and bacon were thrown in the middle without being cooked into the egg. I ate a bite off egg and had to gather the add-ins.  And the amount of bacon was way too much --about twice the amount of veggies!  I didnt like it and was not impressed!  I won't get another omlette from U.S. Egg.  If I come again, I'll stick with the pancakes or club sandwich."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday, busiest day for breakfast & we were seated and served quickly! The protein pancakes are ahhhhmazing"}
{"text":"Delicious! Big portions easily shareable. Was craving some good eggs and I found this joint. Freshly squeezed grapefruit juice,  country fried chicken, and nice spot outside. No complaints..."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast.  The coffee was weak and warm.  Menu was confusing when ordering the protein waffle with half and half.  The server tried to explain the menu but there was some confusion.  We advised the management, they did not describe it in more detail or revealed relevant facts.  The omelette was good, fluffy and cooked just right."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast with my sister I ordered the Eggs Benedict with a side of bacon. Loved the bacon. Very disappointed with the eggs Benedict. One of my eggs were perfectly poached the the other egg was completely under poached. I told the waitress. She didn't even try to do anything about it. I asked her for another plate to Move my fruit and hashbrowns over because If i didn't they would have drowned in uncooked egg white. One key sign of a uncooked egg is when the yolk still has the membrane attached and somewhat separated from the egg white like mine was."}
{"text":"Dear ANYONE reading this, We are somewhat new to Phoenix, moving from Florida.....and even newer to the Moon Valley / Lookout Mountain area.  To say we found a diamond would be an understatement. US Egg not only has food that will keep you coming back for breakfast AND lunch, yes the selection... and quality of selections can keep you coming for an amazing protein pancake with skillet filled with potato, egg, avocado, bacon l, cheese, and other nom nom nommyness.  Their lunch? Seriously, a ton of selections AND for those like me who aren't always sure what to get... they offer HALF AND HALF of sandwich or soup or salad. Like huge portions of each. The albacore, chicken, and egg salad. Amazing. Also their chili can be half the soup and it's awesome. Either way, the only thing better than the food is the amazing staff. The hosts AND ALL service staff are the best in the business, you truly feel like family while eating at US Egg. This is my hubby and I'd favorite neighborhood breakfast spot."}
{"text":"There are so many reasons I love U.S. Egg on Greenway.    There may be a slight wait to get a table but once seated the restaurant is well staffed with attentive servers.   I've never felt neglected while eating there.  Food is excellent.  I had the Gentlemen Jim's Famous Omelette with the outstanding mushroom sauce and it was delicious.    The fact that the place is always busy even into mid morning is a testament of how good the food and service are.  A very well run restaurant."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly disappointed with this place.  I will say the service was wonderful.  Every member of the staff was incredibly nice and the food came out quickly.  The food was a big let down.  I ordered the Sonoran burrito, supposed to have chorizo, Salsa, chiles etc.  it was basically scrambled eggs with giant chunks of onion.  What was supposed to be \"chorizo\" was a couple tiny bits of meat, which had zero flavor, could have been ground beef or turkey for all it tasted like."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. I went to the u.s egg this morning and ordered the half order deal. I got the protein pancakes with vegi Idaho skillet. SOoo yummy! i ate it all. The Idaho skillet had little potato pieces with hash-brown, mushrooms, spinach, tomato, onion and bell pepper. Ordered my egg over easy (cooked perfect) so the egg yoke could drip over it. Mixed it all up and it was a feast. The pancakes made me feel like I was being bad. They had a mixture of flavor, sweet and soft. They melted in my mouth. The orange juice had a slight amount of pulp, which is my fave. you can tell its fresh. As a vegetarian, I saw many options I could eat. Almost ever section of the menu had a vegetarian option, omelets, eggs Benedict, waffles, pancakes, the Idaho skillet as I got, and so on.The menu is huge. The server hinted on what I should order.  My boyfriend ordered the hawk eye egg omelet, it was light and fluffy, and the eggs themselves tasted like an array of wonderfull cheese. Our server, Hillary, was very friendly and got right down to business. I will ask for her every time, she really cares about her job and it shows. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"My wife and went there for breakfast. Nice bright decor inside with smiling waitresses. We were both pleased with the food and service.  Next time we are down for spring training this will be our breakfast place."}
{"text":"Ok this is definitely in the top 3 breakfast restaurants in the entire valley .. there is a reason they have grown  from one location to like six .. so I've eaten at least three of there locations and they are consistently excellent with there presentation and quality..  I've been eating at one location for many years and bring family and new friends here frequently. They have a large menu and plenty of healthy options as well.  You cannot go wrong  with the US egg , it's not gonna get much better than this.. sometimes there busy and there is a wait,  but that speaks for its self,  it's worth the wait!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great great I bring people here standard breakfast fair heathy options and some southwest options as well, good portions great staff always busy never to much of a wait they do a amazing job of getting people in and served.. Bonus coffee out front for people waiting. The breakfast sandwich has tomato and the best bacon on it., can't stop coming here love this place. Family owned local business multiple locations these guys got it right!"}
{"text":"My friends and I made our third visit to U. S. Egg because we enjoy the service and food. We were greeted by a friendly and cheerful greeter and restaurant manager. Our server was friendly with a  good sense of humor. The restaurant and Mens Room are clean.  My breakfast on Saturday morning was the Sonora breakfast burrito with a larger than expected order of hash brown potatoes and large pitcher of ice tea.  My Sunday morning breakfast was the traditional breakfast with a side order of bacon cooked exactly they way I asked.  Both breakfast were tasty, actually I have no complaints about my 2 breakfasts.  While other customers may feel otherwise, breakfast at u.s.egg is a must for me and I know I will return next year for my annual visit for Spring Training"}
{"text":"I have only ordered items to go from here because it is close to work , but the customer service is amazing, they prepare my food quick and I always get what I ordered. The value is great for what you get and its way better than running to fast food. Great prices and menu options!"}
{"text":"First time here this morning!! What a GREAT place! Food was fantastic and the customer service second to none!! A gentleman came over and asked what we thought and let us know of the other locations!! Definitely will come back and tell others!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Decided.to stop here on the way to the airport. Sometimes it's nice to just eat a good classic breakfast and The Good Egg was fantastic. The staff was great, coffee was wonderful and breakfast was delicious. They opened around 6 am so it was perfect. The staff are also super knowledgeable about the menu and are great to ask for recommendations."}
{"text":"I tried out US Egg today for my first time and I am not really sure how I felt about it. I ordered the 'New Yorker' omelette which I imagined so differently. It was almost like they chopped up cubes of chicken and tomatoes and put it between an egg. I was really disappointed. Not only  that, but the hashbrowns had absolutely no flavor - you could taste water on them. The food wasn't delicious, definitely not something to go out of your way for, but of course it is a cheap breakfast franchise so there is not much too expect.   On the bright side, their service was awesome. We had several people check up on us and even though it was Christmas Eve morning, the servers were so upbeat and happy."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here this morning. It was early, 7 am, and we got seated very quickly. There was a lot to choose from on the menu so it took us a bit to decide. We placed our order, and about the time we wondered what was taking so long our food came out.  I ordered the Chicken & Waffles, my wife had the California Benedict. We were both pleased with the way our food was prepared. It was clearly freshly made and not sitting around waiting for us to show up (i.e. McDonald's). It is a clean restaurant, well lit with very clean restrooms. The only thing that wasn't pleasant about the atmosphere was the music, a little too loud and Country. However if you like Country (we don't), it'll be great for you.       Overall it was a great place, and we would go there again. Even though the food is a bit on the more pricey side. I hope you find this review helpful."}
{"text":"Had a long flight and went by US Egg for breakfast after landing. Great meal - corned beef hash was great, the wife's gluten free French toast was good. Only thing keeping form 5 stars was over medium eggs were what we call over easy in Texas - maybe it was a regional thing. Will try again."}
{"text":"If you go on a weekday you usually do not have to wait - if you go prime time on weekends, especially Sat/Sun 9-12 you may have to wait, but usually not long. The food is amazing (protein pancakes - enough said - but everything else is great too) and the food always arrives very quickly, so even if you wait to get a seat you know your food is not far away!"}
{"text":"The reviews are correct, good food, decent service. The protein pancakes are a must have. Try the half n half special."}
{"text":"This place really impressed me. Not only was it super packed but at the same time was seated in a decent time. From the time we ordered food took about 15 minutes which was very impressive considering how packed they were. I ordered the Denver omelette and a Belgium waffle and it was superb. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting Phoenix, and we loved the food there. Friendly host, nice restaurant and tasty food. The only imperfection was that, my server, Ashely, brought out our check when we were still eating our breakfast. Aren't you supposed to bring out check when customers are done with their meals? I'd be highly appreciated."}
{"text":"I still say nothing beats Matt's Big Breakfast downtown, but when one doesn't want to wait an hour plus to get seated, there has to be a contingency plan.  U.S. Egg is a great option!  I don't know what's better at this place: the food or the service.  We've always been seated within seconds of walking in, and our servers have been prompt to take our drink and food orders without making us feel rushed.  Another bonus: order iced tea and they bring a whole pitcher of tea out with your first glass!  Order soda and they'll bring two glasses to start, always replacing one when it runs dry.  Water glasses and a water pitcher are brought without being asked, which is nice.  Servers seem well-versed in the menu, and are always happy to make a recommendation or chat about the food if asked.  The first time I came here, I got a skillet, and our server rightfully warned me that it was a LOT of food.  I could barely finish half.  It would be a great dish to share if two people were in the mood to eat the same thing.  On the second visit I decided to mix it up a bit, and I got a pancake plate with eggs and potatoes.  Eggs and potatoes were pretty basic.  They were seasoned well, but certainly not the best I've ever had.  The pancakes, however...  Get the protein pancakes.  I can't emphasize that enough.  Whole wheat pancake batter, granola, almonds, blueberries, cinnamon...these are absolutely divine.  Apparently they now make a protein waffle (that will be my next culinary adventure here), which sounds equally as amazing.  Decor is kitschy, but in a good way.  It feels like you stepped back in time to the 70s.  Honestly, I'm not one to shave points off a rating just because the restaurant is less than aesthetically pleasing, but I don't have the problem with the decor that other reviewers seem to have.  Maybe my kitsch tolerance is much higher than theirs.  U.S. Egg also has a lunch menu as they're open until the early afternoon, but it's not as tempting as the breakfast menu.  Service staff seems happy to let you sit and chat for a while after you're done with your food, which I've found to be most gratifying.  Prices are great, especially for the amount of food that you get.  I'm happy to go here again and again."}
{"text":"Mass quantities, great quality, fast friendly service...higher end of the price range but well worth it.   Would be an everyday stop but I would gain too much weight...."}
{"text":"Had a not-so-great experience at US Egg. My veggie frittata was really soggy, like a veggie frittata soup. The frozen vegetables must have thawed in the dish."}
{"text":"This place is the best everytime we come here. Any location. I couldnt take a pic of food before eating cuz its so good. Protein panckes are awesome."}
{"text":"We can't figure out what's going on with this place - we don't know if it's new owners, new waitstaff, or what.  It's pretty standard breakfast food, with a few really good items on it.  They are always so busy that it doesn't matter when you go - there is a wait.  The weekends are hit or miss with getting your food in a timely manner, so they can't always keep up with the crowd.  I'd recommend this place on a weekday when it's not so slammed for sure."}
{"text":"Went in 30 minutes until closing without realizing and the service was still excellent. Ordered the garden omelette and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the food,  the portions are huge and the service was good. I would recommended to my friends and family"}
{"text":"I have sped by this place I can't tell you how many times.  Probably on my way to Rudy's or Whataburger.  The building looks kind of plain from the street and it's really easy to just drive on by.  But, after reading some other reviews I decided to venture over here for breakfast for the first time in mid-August, and am so glad I did.  On our first visit my husband had the Cornhusker ($13.99) and I had the avocado and jack omelet ($11.89), plus bacon ($1.25), with a side of fruit ($1.25).  Their coffee is $2.99 and DELICIOUS!!  Some of my favorite breakfast food places have terrible coffee.  Not this joint.  The coffee is slightly nutty and has a smooth flavor.  Love it.  Taylor was our server and everything was perfectly delicious on the first visit.  So we went back for a second visit this past weekend and this time I had the 2 egg breakfast with bacon ($9.49) plus a side of avocado (.95) and my husband had the Triple Play ($10.99) with the protein pancakes (.95).  Delicious all over again.  This time Grace was our server.  They have some happy, friendly people working here.  I love that, and once you're inside, it's a bright, pleasant space.  I had no idea from just cruising by before that it would be so nice on the inside.  U.S. Egg has become a new favorite breakfast place for us and I look forward to trying more items on the menu."}
{"text":"No wait to be seated, very quick service and good food. Serving size was massive. Great value for the amount and quality of food. Appreciated the waitress leaving pitchers of our drinks at the table so we had access to immediate refills."}
{"text":"Well it is 12-12-12, a wonderful Day I think!!!  Got up this morning and the coffee maker was not working. So we came here for breakfast. We have not been in a while so thought it is close we will go. Not too busy, and they have a very nice accomodating staff. We sat inside because, it is in the 50's this week(in the morning). Food is good , coffee is as well. You have to ask for Butter or else they will give you margarine. The water is tap water, so a lot of lemon will kill the taste of bitter and bad. Food is good I just wish they went more natural. Even all the jams are a bit gross. They cut corners here on certain things which really takes away from it all. Otherwise I would give them a 5 star."}
{"text":"The fact that this place was super busy would imply this place had great value and excellent service. However in going to this restaurant this morning the waitress gave horrible service she was very short and snippy! We immediately given the wrong Drinks which the waitress was irritated with us for. The menu was convoluted with extra charges for nearly everything!! Which would have made the bill for 1 adult and two children more than $50 . We opted out of this over crowded over priced poor service establishment and will never return"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. The food is always fresh and hot. If you really are hungry get the meat skillet. Don't forget the protein prank cake yum."}
{"text":"Always a solid meal here. Nothing fancy, except their yummy protein pancakes. I highly recommend the half and half, which is half a skillet and a half order of cakes. Great service and usually not too long of a wait."}
{"text":"Just got denied services at 2:10pm when they close at 2:30pm.   Host the proceeded to reply to my, \"it's 2:10 though\" statement and said yeah well we have carpet cleaners here today so we are closing early.   That isn't my problem. Won't be going back there again!"}
{"text":"First time to US Egg. Had Club Salad and it was a big plate piled high with fresh lettuce, chicken, ham, chopped bacon, avocado and half a hard boiled egg. Nice server. My only comment is that the lettuce was chopped so fine and it was hard to get it on the fork. Strange... maybe it's me. It was good. I'll come back for breakfast. Fresh fruit looked great. They use old style laminated menu from the 70's but the interior is very modern and clean."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning, and it was wonderful. The food was hot, fantastic and came out as ordered. Our server, Sierra, was one of the best we'd ever had. Friendly, attentive, efficient with a good dose of common sense. Great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great and unique breakfast entrees, fast service even on the busiest days and very good service. I recently went in to buy a gift card as a gift and had to wait a few minutes and during this time the manager brought some free juice boxes out to my kids. Very nice business that is very conscious of their customer's satisfaction."}
{"text":"The food was great but our service was terrible. Will be back with hopes for a different server."}
{"text":"Best service I've received in a very long time! This was my first time here. I called and placed an order to go with Carmine. He was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. When I walked into the restaurant and requested my order I was greeted by name. Nothing makes you feel more valued as a guest than being remembered!!! The food is delicious and everything plus more was remembered. I don't know how many times I've ordered food at other restaurants and something was forgot or left out. I am so happy and will be sure to return."}
{"text":"This is definetly our go to breakfast place! Service is almost always great (have had a few under par experiences) , and the food is delicious. One of my favorites is the Santa Fe Idaho Skillet. It has hashbrowns, green chilis, eggs, cheese, chorizo...and I'm sure I'm missing a few other ingredients. Point of the matter is it's great! Eat here!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant love there food, servers, atmosphere. Good prices too and I love there omelets the best."}
{"text":"Great breakfast menu with a lot of variety, but you're going to be going with a protein waffle or pancake! Friendly and attentive wait staff make this a place you'll return to over and over again!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Always drove past this place and never eaten here, but today, we decided to stop by. It was a great idea! We got here at like 11:45 and we were seated promptly, despite it being a Saturday around lunch time. Our server Em was on point and came at the most opportune times. My California Benedict was great and the fresh fruit that came with it was a great touch. 10/10 would eat here again."}
{"text":"Awesome place! They always remember me even if it ha been months since I've been in. I'm not really a breakfast guy so I usually get the chicken philly or an amazing crock of chilli. Get the lental soup when they have it, it is sooooooooo good! Going again Sunday!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I have been to since moving to Tempe almost a year ago, and is my favorite breakfast spot period.   I have had numerous items on the menu but always go back to the half and half, Idaho skillet and the famous protein pancakes which are unreal.   Food quality is excellent, service is fast and accommodating, price is around 10 bucks a dish (well worth it) and the place is very clean. If there is a wait the owner will call us while we go next door to the baseline pub and have a mimosa.    Every out of town guest I have taken there has been very impressed. A can't miss."}
{"text":"Being the first time there I was amazed of the great customer service I received. For one I felt welcome right away, second my server was amazing and third the food was delicious. I will definitely will be coming back to this place instead of the place on 51stave and bell road, crappy service there."}
{"text":"Half and half breakfast is fantastic. We eat here twice a week and have rarely had bad service. The wait even if it looks packed is not much more than 15-20 minutes"}
{"text":"I went in on a Saturday morning and first off mine, my bf's & my nephew's water cup was SO dirty you could still see the finger prints on it and it was greasy. I politely asked for other cups &got the same exact ones back she just wiped them with her shirt behind us and they were still gross and dirty!  The food is great but I would highly recommend the chandler location instead because it is always clean and has better service."}
{"text":"The service was not the best, our waitress brought out our drinks including my coffee and never offered creamer and she didn't come back to check on us so I had to ask another waitress, the food was ok but I've decided maybe it wasn't for us. Not once did the waitress smile or look us in the eyes, we left her a good tip because you never know what people are going through, but unfortunately we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Everyone says that this is the place to go for breakfast and I have to say, I just really wasn't impressed. The people were nice enough but the food was just so so. Eggs ordered over medium were barely cooked at all. Hash browns clearly frozen from the supermarket and bland pancakes- even with syrup and butter on them. Also. The coffee was really weak, as expected for most restaurants. $30 for all this...  I doubt I'll be back. Still looking for a dynamite breakfast spot around here."}
{"text":"This was a very good  breakfast  place, that came highly recommended by a local. We gave it a try & we agree that it's delicious . For breakfast I'm always craving a good  omelet, so I couldn't resist giving the Texas omelet a try which was filled with beef chili, sour cream, & salsa. Best omelet I've ever had. Never thought  to add chili to my omelet. We gave the protein  blueberry pancakes  a try & they were truly delicious . Best pancakes I've had in a while, plus they were slightly more healthy  because of the added protein. This place is a must try if you're craving a good breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this location. Although I will say, we have only dined in once; all other times have been where one of us will go to pick up a to go order. However, we have had amazing service and amazing food with either choice. Typically, we will get the half and half, which consists of a skillet (varying choices, but my favorite is the meat lover's) and protein pancakes (out of this world good). Their food is so awesome, and since the portions are large, we have leftovers too, which U.S. Egg's breakfast foods are insanely good warmed up too. Last time I came in to get a to go order, the manager gave me a complimentary orange juice to sip on while I waited, which was so nice of him! And the order came out in about five minutes, so you can't beat that fast timing. Love, love, LOVE this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"So yummy!   Even though it was Saturday, my bf and I barely had to wait.   I had the half and half veggie skillet and protein pancake. The pancake was alright (full disclosure: I'm not a huge pancake fan so I didn't let that affect my overall rating), but it wasn't as earth shattering as other yelpers have made it seem.   The veggie skillet was amazing, I can't wait to try that again."}
{"text":"So I've been here a couple of times and my first experience was ok, but not great. I ordered a California Benedict and my avocados were all brown and bruised looking.  They tasted ok, nothing spectacular. The reason I'm really giving two stars however is because recently I went here with a friend and her children. She'd never been and I'm so embarrassed I ever recommended this place. We found a sticker from the avocados in our California Benedict, which the manager kindly subtracted from our bill. My friend also found a bug in her food which she did not mention until we left because of the children with us, and knowing their reaction. This place is having sanitation issues and I won't be back. Grossed out!"}
{"text":"There food is pretty ok. I do prefer the breakfast food over the lunch food. Today I have an Idaho Skillet and it was really good and filling. My boyfriend always orders the New England Fish and he is a huge fan of it. For the price of the food they do give you a large portion.   The only thing I didn't like was the French dip. The meat was way to thin and dry and their fries could be better.   Service really depends on the waitress. We had a happily bubbly one before and the last two times we had some miserable girls."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, original egg- themed artwork on the walls. Great lighting. DId I mention great food? Awesome protein cakes and skillets - we usually do the half and half, best of both worlds. My son had french toast and a fruit plate - generous fruit plate with a wide variety of fruit. We have been coming here for over 20 years and it is always consistently good, with consistently good service. Be prepared to wait a bit on the weekends. They also have a lovely patio area with lots of umbrellas for shade and room for the little ones to burn off some energy."}
{"text":"We came in for a very late breakfast accidentally right after they had closed at 2:30pm.  Not only were they hospitable and let us eat, they encouraged us to sit down.  Most places tell you to beat it, but not them.  The manager (George, was it?) and the wait staff were professional, courteous, and really fun.  It was the perfect kind of service where they are there when you need them, but don't hover.  They didn't push us at all, even though we walked in late, and the food...seriously tasty.  I had the spinach omelette and my boyfriend tried out the New York Omelette--something with chicken, and he said it was phenomenal.  We topped it all off with a pumpkin pancake and left feeling very satisfied, confident that we had found a new breakfast go-to place!  Next time we'll have a beer or bloody mary with our breakfast!  They also have gluten free options."}
{"text":"Very good customer service at this restaurant. The food is good. I usually get the California Benedict or the standard eggs Benedict. Even when it's busy, the wait is not very long."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and decided to eat at US Egg as I had positive experiences previously. The customer service was horrible both times I visited. The first we waited a good 20 minutes before being greeted by our waitress and a hostess took our drink orders as she could see us growing uncomfortable. The waitress took our orders and checked in after the food came out...which we had quite a few pieces missing or made incorrectly. She never apologized for the inconveniences.  We decided to give it another try and the second visit was far worse. Around a 25 minute wait to be seated which was understandable since it was Sunday morning. We were seated out on the patio which was actually nice and quiet and not too hot in the summer sun! The refills on drinks were not automatic we had to flag down our waitress twice for refills on water and OJ. However we placed our orders and all of the meals came out after 40 minutes except for mine....it arrived 10-15 minutes after everyone else's after we had to remind the wait staff twice. We spoke with the manager who was very nice and apologized for the inconvenience and completely covered my late meal. The waitress also apologized and was genuinely apologetic about the error.  I will not be returning to this location simply because of the service."}
{"text":"This place has decent food.  The protein pancakes are great.  I enjoyed sitting outside here and having breakfast and it was close to where we used to live.  It's not anything amazing, but it is good when you are craving some breakfast food."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit here with my two kids. Service seemed delayed and disorganized. There were 3 of us but only had 2 place settings despite multiple requests. I had to get the extra place setting from the hostess. The food took nearly 30 mins to reach the table. My son ordered apple juice which came in a small carton which is fine but it was frozen solid. When our waitress finally came by and I pointed it out she brought me another frozen solid one 10 mins later. Suffice it to say the lil guy drank water even though charged for the juice. The food was good but not exceptional. I hope if we ever go back they have made improvements."}
{"text":"This place is right by my office so we often go for work meetings. The staff has gotten to know us and always takes care of us. The protein pancakes are amazing and I always appreciate the to-go cup of coffee to take back to the office. One of my favorite go-to breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.. It does get busy but if you go for brunch the breakfast rush is over.. The food is great!"}
{"text":"So good! Great service no matter when I have dropped in by! Great staff, good food and clean spaces. Thank you for being awesome and one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite breakfast spot. My favorite item on the menu is the half and half meat lover's! Almost always leave here with leftovers because the pancakes are so filling (I love them). Protein Pancakes are great, but if you have a texture thing and don't like \"chunkiness\", try the whole wheat pancakes. They taste just like regular, amazing, decadent pancakes. Everyone is always so friendly and makes me feel welcome (even though I usually come in after rolling out of bed on a Sunday). Thanks for the awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"What a find!  Looking for after Thanksgiving breakfast.    So delicious.   Rancho Huevos was so good.  Extensive Gluten Free menu.    We met the owner Mario,   He was so nice and friendly. Differently a new family tradition"}
{"text":"Just about the best place on earth to have breakfast!  Eat here all the time and have never had a bad experience. The food is excellent and man are they fast. Always friendly and love having breakfast outside when the weather is good."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding all around!!  Food: high quality, great taste, fresh, well prepared, appropriate temperature, great portions, fast. Amazing specials, unique and delicious.  Service: could not be friendlier from the moment you walk in the door to the moment you leave, everyone is friendly and smiling. Super accommodating and attentive.   Atmosphere: light, friendly, open but with enough privacy, clean, cozy, excellent.  Value: a great value for the money!!  I really enjoy this place every time I eat here. It truly feels like a mom and pop restaurant. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The breakfast here was really good and actually on the healthier side. It appears that they are making an effort to make a delicious lighter option. It was extremely clean, our waitress was very friendly and fast, and on a Sunday morning at 9:30 am we only waited 5 minutes. Best part - no screaming children (which is the reason we avoid IHOP at all costs). The protein pancakes were really good although our waitress was a little confused on whether or not they actually had protein powder in them or not. I know pancakes aren't health food but I would have liked to know how bad they really were. Eating out for breakfast isn't our norm so its nice to have an option like this so close to the house!"}
{"text":"We live on the west side, Sun City West, but come here often. The food is amazing and servers are very friendly. My favorite is the spinach mushroom omelet with a side of salsa!! My wife likes the Texas omelet.  But whatever we order it is always great."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or brunch. Our son recommended the protein pancakes and they were indeed delicious. They offer a Half and Half, with protein pancakes, one egg and a skillet of your choice. I got the veggie skillet, others at the table got a Santa Fe skillet, and other meat combos. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The wait staff was great with the baby too."}
{"text":"Great food great service only downside is a long wait sometimes but the food is worth the wait. For a small mom and pop place the cooks  and the waitresses sure keep things moving so when you drive by and you see a line outside do not worry they have free coffee and that makes the wait not to unberable."}
{"text":"I love the great food and the fast service.  My wife and I go for breakfast on weekends, which is always a treat.  Lately, I've been going several times a week for lunch; they have a large variety of 1/2 pound Angus burgers and so far they've all been amazing, especially with a side of sweet potato fries ... I had no idea they served so many non-breakfast items.  All of the hostesses/servers are super friendly, and it's not just about getting tips, they genuinely care about the customers and how their day is going."}
{"text":"One of the best places for breakfast/brunch. Service is fast. Out of all the times I have been there, have only had one meal that was not up to snuff. The pancakes are the best. Portions are equal to the price."}
{"text":"I actually came here two days in a row because it was that delicious. The first time I got the country fried steak and the second, I got chicken and waffles. Both times, the service was great! It's nice that they give your table its own pitcher of water, so you don't have to wait on anyone for more water! Their menu has so many choices, so you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I love great breakfasts and this place has them!!   The atmosphere is like the diners from long ago!   Wait staff is so friendly.   I need to go again!"}
{"text":"Great brunch joint. Service was a bit slow for our party of 10 but the food was good when finally delivered to the table. Great pancakes. Outdoor seating would be a big plus. Sadly, none is offered here."}
{"text":"There's many options for breakfast joints in the area. We come here every time. Food is always good. They offer mimosas and bloody Mary's. Protein Pancakes are  having egg white option on eggs is also a plus. You can eat healthy here and still have an amazing tasting meal."}
{"text":"Wow!  Very expensive and not worth your money!  Scrambled eggs, 4 bacon and a gluten free waffle for $16!  Coffee is $3!!!  Food is nothing to brag about at all! Seriously????  They need to change their name to \"The Expensive Egg\"!  Will never return!!!  Sticking to First Watch!!!  Better food and prices!!!"}
{"text":"I love the US Egg - but the service at this location is AWFUL!! I have been going to the Tempe location for the last 15 years and it is a well oiled machine... The food is perfect and the service is awesome!! The new Chandler location has just as good as food, but after we got seated we waited 30 minutes to order and then we waited another 30 minutes to get out order (for two people).  After we were done eating we didn't see our server for another 20 minutes until we had to stop her as she was walking by and request our bill.  You may want to wait a few months until the service improves, go to the Tempe location in the mean time."}
{"text":"Pretty gross. They don't use fresh fruit in the pancakes, the servers do not know the menu when you ask questions and the other egg dishes are runny. got my breakfast with half off my food hanging off the plate. Much better and healthier breakfast options in town."}
{"text":"Starting a day of errands and shopping.. started remembering I had not eaten and needing some caffeine.. I see US Egg in my peripherial.. next stop.. a booth with a awesome waitress remineniscent of my grandmother named Sue.. Seriously if the food had truly sucked.. which it didnt , she rated a 5.. and thats just hard to achieve today in our country.. I got the protein pancakes.. Sue told me she felt thatd be too much for me.. so she split the order.. good call.. I ate only half the half order.. I loved them! Awesome coffee.. and a side of fruit.. she took my pot of coffee.. poured it into the to go cup.. fresh cream and thats it.. Im ready for errand running and jean shopping..Way to go:=)"}
{"text":"I Dined there today with a guest; prior to that, it has been a few years and my opinion has not changed for the better, only for the worse. Myself and another guest decided to go today for brunch because I received a $10.00 off any entrée coupon. We ordered our entrees,  the turkey sausage were tasteless, and my scrambled eggs were hard & dry-gross!  The waitresses stood in the kitchen door taking turns staring at me-real weird! No third eye, no scars, just dining with someone whose race did not match my own which is probably why there was such a silent 'ruckus'.  At any rate,  we were presented with the bill, at such time I handed our waitress the $10.00 off coupon. The waitress disappeared for a long time, then finally emerged & asked if we received our bill back from her manager. -What??? Did I miss something? How did our meal involve her 'manager' all of a sudden?  Hmmmmm, we then received the bill from the waitress and I noticed that the oj and coffee (2 each) were $5.98 to explain it more clearly, the 2 coffees were $5.98 and the 2 OJs were $5.98.   It was my mistake for not paying attention to their prices!  However, when I questioned the bill, the waitress was quiet-crickets!  No comment. Needless to say, for the below standard food, adjustment to bill & service, we will not return, and oh, did I mention that I in turn made no adjustment under the 'tip' section other than to line it out!  Get it boys and girlz?  lol!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Will definitely come back. Had the traditional breakfast with the grilled.ham. I am so satisfied"}
{"text":"Its all rite I guess, good location, fairly decent menu and the order came promptly and was as the menu described.  two things they can work on.  1.  get better coffee.  the price of coffee does not justify the taste of this semi-bitter black liquid.  get some cartel or something.  2.  turn down the music a little, i dun mind country music, but not so loud and early in the morning ! :)  come here if u are on chandler and need a bite.  its got a faster moving wait list than cracker barrel on the other side of the 10."}
{"text":"I don't know how I have never eaten here before. Definitely won't be the last time I come here. The food was delicious and fast. Big portions. Biscuits and grave where very good here."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service, they even leave the coffee and water jugs on your table, and check on how your doing throughout the breakfast, only waited 10 min on a Saturday morning for indoor group of 3. I had the chicken friend steak and eggs and amazingly soft biscuits and gravy. Do yourself a favor go here and not someplace like Dennys. Excellent food A+"}
{"text":"I think this is the original US Egg in the Valley. This place is nothing short of \"awesome\". And for not being part of a large national chain, you really do feel like the food is home cooked. Try the protein cakes. (Blueberries, almonds, protein powder in pancakes) or the Veggie Skillet. The waiters are all very friendly and the owners, Mike and Gebron, go out of their way to remember your name and shake your hand. Atmosphere at the Baseline restaurant is small and intimate. They have some great outdoor seating on their shady patio in the right weather.  You will find a wait on Saturday and Sunday mornings but I guess that means the food's good!"}
{"text":"The patio is really nice except for the flies and the food is pretty good. Get the hash browns with cheese."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location since the 90s. This company used to be a great local family owned business when the dad ran it.  Then the son took over and turned it into a chain. It has totally lost it's family feel. Just seems like another chain. Oh well. Food is ok and service was just alright.  Get back to your roots."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, always great service despite being busy, prices are fine and haven't found anything g o didn't like.   The chef and cooks here kbow what they are doing. Eggs always come out stunning and exactly how I ordered, even more difficult kinds (poached comes to mind). Food is hot, beautifully presented and excellently cooked. What more could a guy ask for?"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, well before they expanded to multiple valley locations.they are probably the smallest of their locations, too.  Food is always good, if not a great value for breakfast, and the coffee is high quality. Staff is generally very good, but it seems it may be a training location for the others in this local chain, and there can be missteps but they are always quickly corrected.  If busy, the place is noisy. Best bets are the protein pancakes, followed by the omelettes. It seems they house make the chorizo, it is apparently all beef and low fat. Corned beef hash is the hormel canned crap.  They have a health conscious portion of the menu--think Atkins/low carb--and substitutions are usually handled well."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot. Love the protein pancakes! Usually get half and half (two protein pancakes and an Idaho skillet). Must try!"}
{"text":"I got the Bay Area French Toast based on other photos that I saw on here. What I got was completely different...the bananas were brown and slimy, and the toast was very soggy. The plate was brought out a mess as well, so I could tell the cooks took no pride in what they were making. Also, in case you do not like preserves, the strawberries were not fresh. Overall I was expecting much better and was very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I walked into US Egg the day after Ironman Arizona.  OK...I hobbled in and then gingerly, very gingerly sat down.  I instantly asked for a hot chocolate with EXTRA whip cream and my waitress did not disappoint.  I was given a tower of sugary goodness, which I ate a lot faster than my run pace.  I ate some combination of eggs, meat, and potatoes.  In my post-race fog, I honestly don't remember what it was called, but I know that (a) I liked it and (b) I wasn't hungry when I was done, which is quite an accomplishment the day after racing 140.6 miles.  If I ever return to AZ, I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. They really know how to cook eggs. If you order them over medium, that's what you get. Nice thick bacon & crispy hash browns."}
{"text":"Went to U.S. Egg for the first time this weekend. Have not been to any of their other locations before. Was very surprised that we got a table in less than 10 minutes on a Sunday morning at 11AM, very cool! Staff was very friendly, although our server had a hickey on her neck! Not the prettiest thing to look at.... Food was delicious with a wide enough selection of unique menu items that you did not feel like you were eating the same old thing. Will make sure to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Spending a few days in Arizona, found US EGG online, good reviews, close by and they serve breakfast. This is my kind of place. Sunday gets busy so expect a short wait, about 20 minutes in our case (even though the hostess said 40 minutes). I usually take it as a good sign when there are people waiting out front to be seated. So I personally went with the Texan omelette and it was delicious. Karen, our waitress was awesome, great personality and a great smile. Breakfast was so good we ate here twice and Karen was our waitress again. So let me say, same great service, same great food and we definitely look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Very yummy breakfast! We met my mom here on her way out of town and had an excellent meal. My blueberry pancakes were fantastic. My husband had some sort of egg and meat concoction and it was great as well. My mom was quite pleased with her veggie omelet. Despite being busy our wait wasn't long and the service was quick."}
{"text":"It's family-owned, & their protein pancakes rule!!! ...just wish they kept record of calorie count."}
{"text":"Eh....  In our quest to try a new Breakfast place, this place isn't making our short list, it's actually not even making the top 20. First off, it's over priced, I would say everything on the menu is a good $1.00 - $1.50 too expensive. This was my first thought before even ordering, after getting our food, my opinion is the same. If you're going to blow me away with eggs that melt in my mouth, then yes, I will certainly pay a little more than the average place. But, the food here was just that, \"average\".   The portion sizes were OK. My eyes didn't pop out of my head nor did I wonder where the rest of my breakfast was.   I don't know why it was so busy for a place that's nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Their gluten free waffle was great! Service was awesome and they were very speedy! For a celiac girl this was a fantastic breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"I moved from Tempe to the east coast in 1999.  Whenever I come to visit Arizona, I am invariably asked, \"Where do you wanna eat, Jill?\" and I always say, \"If I don't get some protein cakes from US Egg, there's gonna be trouble.\"    An example of my love and dedication:  A few weeks ago I was flying to Portland and I had a 2.5 hour layover in Phoenix.  My friends came to pick me up at the airport, drive 1,000 MPH to US Egg so we could get our protein cake fix in, and then they whooshed us back to the airport.  That's love, man.  So yeah, it is some of the tastiest brunch you will ever eat.    I don't care what you order; make sure you get some protein cakes.  Yeah yeah, sure, they go fine with a Santa Fe chicken sandwich.  Stop overthinking it and just eat it.   So in case you don't know what a protein cake is, it's like this: Think of the most delicious pancakes you've ever had.  Now replace the crappy white flour with some whole wheat flour so you're not unknowingly killing  yourself.  Now add a very generous scoop of fresh blueberries into the pancake batter.  And now add a significant quantity of almonds and granola.  And now add an unholy amount of cinnamon and spices.   Notice that it is bigger than your head; notice that you get two of them.  And then top it off with about 903 metric tons of butter and real maple syrup.  If you haven't found love right there on your plate, then dare I say you have a non-functional tongue.  Try the hot skillets, too-- super-good.     But everything they have there is really good.  Very fresh ingredients, lovingly prepared, good coffee (decent decaf, too!), and served by waitstaff who are in impossibly good shape (ever notice that?).  The owners are really great guys; they always make you feel welcome and appreciated, even when the line is long.  Speaking of lines, there is often a pretty big crowd on the weekends.  Waiting for your table is no biggie; in the cooler months they have hot coffee outside for you, and in the summertime they have water and lemonade.  The wait won't be that that long anyway, I promise.  I love that place."}
{"text":"Super nice staff. Not great food. 14 bucks for a crappy sandwich, fries and soda. Grease needs to be changed... soda was in a dirty cup, kinda scary to touch ketchup bottle... for the style of the place, I'd much prefer a Dennys or something... won't be going back. The area has better options with better prices."}
{"text":"We really like this place.  The owner is always front and center when we walk in, the food is always good and the service is good as well.  I wouldn't describe the food as outstanding, but it is decent food for a decent price.  We go there a couple times a month."}
{"text":"I am so in love with this restaurant! I have yet to order anything, or see anyone order anything, that looks disappointing.   Above all, please make sure you try the protein pancakes! They are whole wheat pancakes with granola, brown sugar, blueberries, and almonds inside. It is an amazing burst of flavor over and over again. My advice: get the full order to share... or order the \"half and half\" which is a smaller portion of the pancakes with an sort of small skillet bake.   This place is chill, welcoming, friendly, and absolutely delicious. I take all of my guests here to show off the great breakfast food in the valley."}
{"text":"I've always read good reviews of this place, so I wanted to try it and boy was I disappointed. The location in Chandler was not clean -at all, in talking dingy carpets, I even washed my own silverware bc that was dirty also. I ordered and egg white omelet which came with homefries a meat and toasts. When I tell you the food was cold and nasty! It was, I didn't even eat my meal, I took the fruit that it came with home but I was completely turned off. The waitress was very nice and we got our food quick, prices are fair. I would never go here again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Huge menu. Lots of choices. Pleasant decor, very crowded - all good signs. The two of us had the New York omelet and Spinach Florentine. Hopefully without sounding too nitpicky, I found the latter name to be a bit redundant, b/c of that funny.  Even though the size of the plates didn't overwhelm us, as has happened before, neither of us could finish the food. Cooked well.  The menu prices were (imo) uneven. Most of it was reasonably priced but there were some items that seemed very expensive for what you were getting. Like sliced tomatoes on the side for $2.45. However, I liked the option of ordering hollandaise as a (very reasonably priced) side. Likewise pitcher or water with lemon on table.  Pricewise, most important would be the coffee - we both ordered a cup. It came in a small carafe but the bill for both coffees was $4.58. That just seemed very expensive to me. It was typical diner coffee - better than some but definitely not what I'd choose on a regular basis. I don't expect it to be excellent but it is an integral part of breakfast out.  The total for 2 came to about $27 with tip - a lot more than I thought reasonable for breakfast.  Re: service, it was quick and fast. Not particularly friendly or unfriendly. But I had to clean the table after as there were grounds and coffee under where she first placed the carafe. Plus when I requested more cream (those jugs are tiny!) she put it right on the open newspaper on my right that I was reading. Needless to say, that didn't thrill me.   Overall, the food was ok, but I would look long and hard before going back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Huge portions and a good variety. I particularly like the hot skillets. My two favorites are the Sante Fe and the Meat lovers. This location is a bit far from our house but luckily for me, my wife has a weekend appointment nearby every couple of months and I get to stop by visit. Staff is friendly and service is quick."}
{"text":"I great place for breakfast if you are really hungry. The portions are huge. I like the skillet breakfasts the best. The locations are bit always from my house but when I am nearby on weekends, I like to stop."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all! The only reason I feel the need to give two stars is because the staff was sweet and attentive during my whole visit. For a breakfast joint, US Egg has such a small selection of beverage options in the caffeine department. No lattes, iced coffees, cappuccinos, etc. The toast was dry and hard and the French toast was disappointing. The plates come garnished with an orange slice and a tiny leaf of browned dried up lettuce. Why bother putting the lettuce at all? It has no relevance to breakfast, let alone French toast and it ruins the presentation on the plate."}
{"text":"I didn't think it was possible to mess up eggs or hash browns until I ate here.  My scrambled eggs were chewy, how does that happen?  And the hash browns were barely cooked, so the result was a pile of mush on my plate, not even slightly crispy.  The entire menu is pricey, especially for the poor quality of food.  Over 20 bucks for 2 people, just entrées, not even a drink.  This place is always busy, which I don't understand because their food sucks.  They told us 10 minutes, and 25 minutes later we were seated.  It took forever for our waitress to come and take our order and for our food to come out.  I am giving them 2 stars because my husband did enjoy the Idaho Hot Skillet of the Half & Half.  He didn't like the other half, which was pancakes.  If it wasn't for the skillet, I would have given them only 1 star."}
{"text":"Nice gem in Tempe, excellent breakfast menu and great service.  Coffee was good and they kept my cup full.    Next time I'm in town on business, I will be dining here again!"}
{"text":"I always love coming to this U.S. Egg! Very wonderful service every single time. I always order the \" Half and Half\", which is two smaller protein pancakes and a half skillet of your choice. If anything is not made to your liking, they'll re-make it. Happy customers are their top priority!"}
{"text":"It took our food 45 minutes to come out from the kitchen because they lost our ticket.  The food was just okay.  I had the California benedict, which I found to be bland.  My husband had the half and half.  He liked it.  Ultimately, we would not go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The protein pancakes are very good and filling. Bring a big appetite for those. The Denver omelette is great as well."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a healthy breakfast. Everything was great especially the wheat pancakes! Service was friendly and prompt. I recommend this place enthusiastically."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with my first visit to u.s egg. Probably will not be coming back. For 17$ i got 2 pieces of dry cold French toast that butter and syrup couldn't even penetrate. California eggs Benedict with a tiny bit of hollandaise and over cooked poached eggs with also cold hash browns.  Our waitress didn't check back after she delivered the food until it was too late and by then i was too hungry and just ate what i could.. Overall i think they are over rated and over priced for the quality and quantity of the food served.."}
{"text":"If u want to eat here grab a dart and throw it on the menu, itll taste aweSome, and good eye candy for the morning and the owner is onsite and gives freebies sometimes, great environment/ethics"}
{"text":"The turchino coffee is great. The wife loves the protein pancakes and we make a special trip to this side of town just for them. Good service and good food."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Love sitting on the patio under the beautiful trees. Would just like to hear some nice music while enjoying eating there. :)"}
{"text":"Generous portions, friendly and comfortable. Plenty of menu choices to. Order coffee or iced tea and you get a carafe or pitcher to yourself. Then they give you a to go cup! Food was tasty and service was quick."}
{"text":"Gluttony at its finest! I came here after a Saturday morning hike because I was STARVING!!! I was able to order their half and half which consist of smaller two protein pancakes and half of one of their Idaho Hot Skillets so I got the Bacon, onions & peppers skillet. Two smaller protein pancakes my ass!! Those pancakes were HUGE! If those are the small pancakes, then I would hate to see what the regular size look like. Not that I am complaining at all lol. Seriously though, it was good.  Like another reviewer said, it was hard to get a refill on drinks and all I had was coffee and water. Now don't get me wrong, they do leave the coffee pot on your table, but can a girl get some extra water? Please? But other than that, I will definitely be back, post hike of course :)"}
{"text":"It's rare that an entire staff is as friendly and pleasant as the folks at US Egg. I've never encountered a negative or even remotely neutral persona here. Plus the food is great and my coffee cup is never empty. If you haven't already, you gotta try the protein pancakes. One bite and you'll be a believer!"}
{"text":"Love the theme of this place! The food was delicious! Our server Sydney (721) was very friendly and helpful. Everything sounded so good and she suggested the half & half so I could try a couple things. Their protein pancakes were so good! Next time my husband and I are in town we'll definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy my breakfast here au all.  The bloody mary was weak. The sausage gravy was very salty. The hash browns had no salt.  The biscuits we're mushy. The service was good though as a redeeming quality.  I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Close to home and food is consistently tasty! The owner is always there and welcoming and the staff is always warm asks helpful. I especially love all their gluten free options! It makes dining out with the hubs so much easier! He really enjoys the chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy. I like the 2 egg breakfast I think it's called and the gluten free french toast with strawberries and bananas! Yum!!    Definitely give it a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for. The combo, Protein Pancakes and Vegi- Skillet, was perfect. I loved the texture of the pancakes, like nothing I've had before. The vegetables in the skillet were cooked just right with an over-easy egg to top it. Loved the lightly cooked spinich.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, great menu, fast and friendly service as well as affordable.  Tried the protein pancake on recommendation from a great friend she was right best pancake I have ever had bar none! If you love breakfast this is where you should be give it a try, you will see me here again and again."}
{"text":"What can I say about a restaurant that serves the most popular breakfast foods?  Well I'll start with the service. The owner is outright an awesome host. He gave us the best server \"Emily\" that any establishment could ever have as a server. She alone made my Phoenix morning. I wish we could have more \"professional\" servers like her in California.  Now the food. Best pancakes ever. I repeat. The best pancakes ever. Just give the protein pancakes a try. Any version of the protein pancakes are awesome. The bonus is the bacon \"AKA breakfast candy\". When I come back, I'll come back every time."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't insanely busy. My group sat in a booth near the kitchen, where there was also an exit outside. Halfway through our meal someone on staff decided to prop the exit door open so the 100+ heat could make our meal very uncomfortable. The waitress was inattentive and didn't make enough stops to check on us or our drink levels and took excessively long when bringing anything back. The food was pretty good, but the total experience was negative."}
{"text":"EGG-CELLENT!!!! Food was great and the staff is really friendly! Totally wish there was a U. S. Egg in Cali!"}
{"text":"Great Bfast! Good Service! Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Wow! been to the other location at 7th & Greenway and as I said WOW this one was a lot better! Great service great food! We will return!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Feel like one plate could fill up two people. Plus free wifi   I ordered the half and half, pancake with Santa Fe skillet. Real good food, it feels like it's home made, not pre made like Denny's or ihop. I felt satisfied and had good left over for later.   Their protein pancakes are delicious, if you're out of town(like myself) I would try and fit in a order of their protein pancakes. Something new and different."}
{"text":"I was so eggcited to eat Here. Food was good for the price and there was even leftover to take home, which is always a plus in book."}
{"text":"About the same as Denny's or Village Inn.  Guessing the food comes prepped, so I wouldn't consider it making breakfast as much as it is \"food assembly.\" Pretty sure eggs came in a box too & not fresh cracked. Had the Denver omelette. Ham, onions, & peppers were obviously added in after the egg had been plated & not cooked together. 1/2 the hash brown were extra crispy & 1/2 were \"just done\" obviously coming from separate piles on the griddle & instead of mixing them together, they came like that on the plate too. Staff was very nice so that was a plus.  If 5 stars is an \"A\" & 1 is an \"F,\" I say they are about a \"C\" or \"D,\" so they get 2 stars today."}
{"text":"The protein pancakes were fantastic, just what you need if you're going to do some adventurous outdoor activity and want to get loaded up with nutrients. Most things designed to give energy don't taste so good - these are delicious tasting with a pleasing texture. One of the best pancakes I can recall having. Get it, unless you're a communist."}
{"text":"Good place, good atmosphere.  Many customers, busy, yet welcoming.  The waiter was friendly.   The menu is appropriate, varied.  I wish waffles were offered in the kids menu.  My son wanted and I paid for an adult portion, which is a good size.   However, a bit too much for my son."}
{"text":"Meh - over priced, mediocre food.  I ordered the Kansas City scramble with scrambled eggs.  I asked that the eggs be cooked through...I got brown, hard, dry, unseasoned scrambled eggs.  Coffee is almost $3... That's more than gourmet coffee shops! And the coffee is bitter and lukewarm.  We were seated in a back tucked away corner and, as anticipated, we had very slow service.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Service was great! Not as fast as the Scottsdale location but it'll get there.  Food was delicious!! Love me some protein pancakes!!"}
{"text":"Very possibly the best omlet I've ever had!  U. S. Egg is always busy, but the service is friendly and fast!  The food is delicious and they have gluten free options."}
{"text":"First time & last time!  For what they charge for their food ($11 for a Patty Melt.. $7 for 2 eggs, hashbrowns & an English Muffin), you'd think the food would be amazing. It wasn't! Raw hashbrowns, English Muffin that wasn't even toasted & to top it all off, we found a piece of plastic (appeared to be part of a wrapper from cheese) in our veggie omelet."}
{"text":"Amazing fast service,everyone is extremely friendly has that home feeling. The food is very good as well I got the Arizona fritatta,delicious! Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for good breakfast and no wait!"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place as it has an excellent breakfast menu, great variety from comfort food and basics, to more unique choices .  Their protein pancakes are like no other, as well as their Hollandaise sauce on the Eggs Benedict.  U.S. Egg has a very friendly local staff and appear to be family owned.  We are all very glad to have them here in the neighborhood.    I leave off one star as the lunch menu is quite ordinary.  However for basic food and good service it's perfect.  Good food, great service, and locally owned and operated!    We definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"Our go-to breakfast spot in our neighborhood when we aren't looking for super greasy. We always brought our out-of-town guests here for breakfast/brunch. I always went for their \"patented\" protein pancakes and their skillets are good too. There can be a line on weekend mornings, but there is free coffee outside while you wait."}
{"text":"We went to U.S. Egg after my son's baptism a few weeks ago. We called a week ahead to put our 'name in' because our party was for 14 people and they don't technically take reservations.  I was glad to hear that they would put our group at the top of the list for our convenience and we wouldn't have to wait that long (Which was great because we had a baby and an elderly family member). When the Sunday morning came (10am) we arrived and we were greeted very warmly. How refreshing, a busy restaurant smiling and not freaking out due to the party size. The restaurant was bright and seemed rather casual. They seated us promptly (no waiting). There was a manager (I believe) that even took our cake we had back to the fridge so it didn't take up space and would be fresh ready to go after brunch. He was so nice! Now comes the food part. It took a long time for a waitress to come over and take our order. Which was odd, you would think with a party that big, the server wouldn't have that many other tables. The poor girl had 4 aside from us!! Poor thing. Although we were starving, when the waitress did finally take our order (15+ minutes), she was very pleasant. I could bet she was frazzled, but she didn't show it when she arrived at our table. So ordering wait time was not good, but once again, customer service was nice.  And after all, a good experience at a food restaurant is highly based on the staff. I ordered pancakes, turkey sausage, and scrambled eggs. All very good, but nothing was 'amazing' or 'had to have'. But was hot, had just the right amt. of seasoning. And the food arrived pretty quickly after ordering (normal for a large party size). Please note, they do have a menu for gluten free I believe. (One member of the party had to order special for their diet). Then the manager brought out the cake we brought and a bunch of plates (and 'to go boxes for the rest of the cake).Very nice indeed. After all was done, we had to split the bill unfortunately, so it created a bit of havoc when separating the bill. My sister had a coffee on her bill (and she didn't order one) and we had a whole meal added to our bill and we had to get that removed. The manager again stepped in and was very cordial and removed the item (after 15 min. of discussion with the waitress).   All-in-all, we would go back to this restaurant, it wasn't that expensive, had a great staff, and decent food."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast  the omelette was excellent! The cooks must know what their job. The food has great flavor! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here is awesome! Huge portions and the food tastes excellent too (not just mounds of cardboard tasting junk)."}
{"text":"Need someplace to get a bite to eat  and  like a plain breakfast? Well US Egg is probably your spot.  This place has the makings of  a good little restaurant but it falls short of making any outstanding items not to mention the decor falls flat as well.  Let me take you back many moons to a era when ASU kids would go to US Egg on Mill  after a night of fun . I was one of those kids  and I loved their omelet and biscuits at that time. They had a cutesy americana vibe and I thought I was pretty cool hanging there.  So when I saw a US Egg near my  hood I thought it would be great to take Mom and give it a try.  I immediately was bugged by the decor , it is americana gone wrong and cheap ..I have so many ideas to fix up the place Mom and I brain stormed all the possibilities , first we would throw out the plastic tropical plants throughout the joint, this is about kitschy not  an aquarium . We would take out the cheap blue cloth booth seats and hard wooden uninspired chairs for red Naugahyde and  chrome stools .Give it a bunch of fun metal signs and some whimsical tablecloths and we might love it! We will let you keep the yellow walls  and big black and white pics.   Now for the food  my low carb omelet  was so bored I heard it  whining about nothing to do..  It was called the Dan Marjerle ,who I thought was exciting back in the day , but his poor omelet seemed to lack seasoning or creativity . Slices of avocado don't make you unique.  Daughter liked her humongous hang off the plate whole wheat pancakes , so that was nice. Of course she loves whole loaves of plain bread so consider that.  Grandma though her Patty Melt was quite tasty and it did look good, served on a dark rye bread it looked not so bad. But I didn't see or smell anything earthshaking. Can you go wrong with cheese , a patty and onions ?  Service was  pretty good considering it was lunch time. I liked that they brought pitchers of beverages not just a cup. Waitress was nice and easily and quickly  met our requests. The host remembered my name and went out of his was to say goodbye ,also a nice touch.  i want to say I found a great little place with unique breakfasts  but as you know I never lie..."}
{"text":"Protein pancakes!!!! Need I say more?!? The skillets are great and plenty of food to share. Irish coffees are delish too! Ask them for my special request, the chicken fried steak Benedict. Eggs benedict with chicken fried steak instead of ham, biscuit instead of English muffin and country gravy in addition to hollandaise sauce. Heart attack on a breakfast plate? Yes. Please enjoy sparingly."}
{"text":"Good food, prepared right, priced reasonably, fast ordering and fast food delivery, our server was friendly and the hostess was Hot! Nuff said. I give it a four star it was a nice breakfast stop"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places. It's the only place that my parents like to go to these days. The owner is a gentleman and the staff is delightful. They can make a perfect soft poached egg which other breakfast places have issues with."}
{"text":"Overrated. Pancakes were burnt, hash browns overcooked and dry. Country fried steak, which is what I order at every restaurant I've been visiting in each US state east to west, was actually the most unimpressive out of all I've tried."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Been going here for years. They're always super friendly and if they're busy they try to get you in quick. Been to both locations and they're both amazing. Although I find that the one on I-17 and Bell is a bit larger so it's faster to get into on a weekend morning. They're known for their protein pancakes, as they should be because they're delicious! If you're looking for a great breakfast place this is the go-to for me and my family."}
{"text":"Always delicious spot for breakfast. Staff is super friendly and it's constantly crowded which is certainly a good thing. This place is close by to us and the food is 10/10.  Downsides: 1. Our waitress forgot to switch the hash browns to fresh fries on one order (which was never corrected since she didn't come by the table for a while). 2. Had to ask another waitress for the ice tea we ordered 10 minutes into service since it never came.   Nonetheless, those were 1 off's on this visit and anyone reading reviews looking for a great family breakfast joint should stop on in this one! Gentleman at the front whom greets everyone is always happy, too which makes for a great first impression!"}
{"text":"The half n half is perfect size for me to split! The pancakes are perfect, I usually don't feel good after eating pancakes, because they are so starchy. These give me a good boost for starting the day and are so filling!"}
{"text":"I own a business walking distance from this place and decided to take several employees there for breakfast this week.  Food was as expected okay.  The real disappointment was someone from my party asked if they can switch the English Muffin for a waffle and charge us for the difference.  The server said no.  Not good as other places would've jumped to creating a great experience.  As we all know business survive on repeat local business.  We won't be back there as the customer service just wasn't there.  I can't understand why they have 2-3 employees outside on the streets with signs to get business but once you're there they can't meet your your simple expectations.  I mean, really?  Charge us for the freakin waffle and serve it, don't just tell us no."}
{"text":"Wow. Great breakfast! Rolled into Phoenix on a whim, and ended up here for breakfast. Awesome spot. Food is great and the staff very warm. Aryanna our server was both pleasant and helpful! Recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The protein pancakes are worth the drive and wait!! Just wish the bacon wasn't over done every time.   Great service!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it is about the N. Phoenix area but we have been hard pressed to find a good breakfast restaurant let alone something  even remotely close to decent. Well we found it finally in US Egg. The staff is top notch, so friendly and kind. The food is fresh, delicious and comes out hot, unlike most places we've been to where the food has been sitting around just waiting for the next poor soul. Love this restaurant, can't wait for our next family weekend breakfast!"}
{"text":"This was some good solid breakfast! I wouldn't say that anything in particular blew me out of the water (apart from maybe how cute the girls who work there are), but there wasn't a single thing wrong with any part of my meal.  The atmosphere was kinda typical breakfast joint look and feel. It has apparently very recently been redone, so everything is new and clean. Theres a pretty cool looking american flag made out of egg cartons on one of the walls, which I have to admit looked pretty awesome.  I ordered the New York Omelet, which has chicken, spinach, tomatoes, and onions, I think, covered in your choice of hollandaise or cajun sauce. I knew i wanted the hollandaise, but I was kinda curious about what this cajun sauce was too, and I think the server could tell I was conflicted so she brought be both on the side! The cajun sauce really tasted more like a creamy chili, actually. It was good, just not what I wanted on the omelet, so I slathered on the hollandaise and got to eating. There is an english muffin and a side of hash browns as well.  The omelet was quite delicious, though I would say the chicken was a little on the dry side--not terribly so but enough to notice it. The hash browns were really well cooked and not at all greasy. I also ordered a tall glass of OJ, and was very glad to have fresh squeezed arrive at my table.  The servers are very friendly, willing to have a laugh, and kinda spunky considering the early hour; they help to get your morning started off right. And did I mention theyre good looking too? Ok, lets just be honest: theyre freakin hot. Ok? If you like good breakfast being served by hot, spunky, friendly waitresses, get it as US Egg."}
{"text":"This is exactly what a breakfast place should be. My over-medium eggs were perfect, the bacon the exact amount of crisp it should be, and the coffee was quite nice - a big, medium-rich roast. Probably the best fruit plate I've ever had at a restaurant. Pretty clear that the staff are inspecting the fruit to ensure it's tasty before serving it, which is pretty shocking to find, honestly. Location is a little weird, and decor is a little bit Boca, but my stomach is so happy I have to give 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is way above average in portion size and quality of food. The menu has a wide variety of healthy as well as traditional fare. The protein pancakes and waffles are awesome, and in my opinion this is the best \"real\" cup of coffee you can find... Staff is friendly and courteous.."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place for meeting friends. The food is great and menu has something for everyone. There is also some outdoor eating tables as well. The service is prompt and friendly. They do a great job of keeping the coffee cups full and checking to make sure you have everything you need."}
{"text":"This place is super close by our house so we decided to try it out for our new breakfast plate. I ordered the garden omelette which came with hash browns and an English muffin. The hash browns appeared to be cooked thoroughly but were very mushy on the inside. The omelette itself tasted like nothing.. Literally.. Nothing. The veggies (especially the spinach) were bland. I honestly told my fiancé I couldn't even taste what I was eating. The English muffin was cold and I don't think actually toasted. We were handed the wrong bill ($11 more) and when we said it wasn't ours the other waitress said \"happens all the time\".. Ummmmm.. My fiancé had corned beef and hash. I thought it tasted like dog food but he said it was mediocre. All in all, of I do ever come back, out of convenience only, I definitely wont be eating hash browns again. Although, it's hardly worth the $20 when you hated your meal.."}
{"text":"So I came here early in the morning to beat the rush. I arrived at approximately a little bit before 8 o'clock this morning. I was greeted by three friendly faces who were ready to take me to my table. I ordered protein pancakes, scrambled eggs, and turkey sausage. The service was excellent as I receive my food within about three minutes of ordering it. They proactively asked if I wanted to have my drink to go in it to go cup. The food was phenomenal. The protein pancakes were my favorite! It had some granola and blueberries and cinnamon mixed in there. I can't wait to come back and visit this place with my family!"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood spot. Menu covers breakfast and lunch items. Two of us tried the skillets. One of us had the Stars and Stripes waffle.  I think the pancakes and waffles are the best way to go."}
{"text":"Great food, huge menu & fast service. There is almost never a wait. The staff is always super friendly, enough staff on weekends which seems to be a problem at most good breakfast joints. The protein pancakes are amazing!! I do wish they had buttermilk as an option though. The food is always really fresh, fast and there's a great selection for everyone to enjoy."}
{"text":"I have been multiple times already. I get this craving soooo I go and I keep ordering the same plate (Santa Fe skillet - so good, highly recommend!), and the food is consistently good. I've had different waitresses, service has always been great. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great morning spot. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Management is beyond friendly they make you feel like family. Service is always amazing."}
{"text":"Let's start with what was good. Service was great; attentive, friendly and fast. This is a nice neighborhood restaurant that makes you feel like part of the neighborhood. Drinks come two at a time, and coffee in a carafe, so you are never left waiting for a refill. To be honest, I expected a little more from the food, especially considering the amount of customers packed in on a Wednesday morning. I had the corned beef hash with eggs and hash browns. Nothing really stood out or had any specialness to it. The hash was mushy and tasted as though it had come from a can. The hash browns lacked crispness and salt.The eggs were poached well however. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, but after having had breakfast here, I can honestly say I don't think I would come back. Painfully average. I would recommend you stick with the pancakes everyone seems to rave about. My guess is they are good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast. A little pricey but food and service is good and the place is really clean. You should try the protein pancakes!"}
{"text":"Shelby provided our group of seven with exceptional service. We were visiting from out of town and loved the food. We will be back next time we're here."}
{"text":"The Half & Half, consisting of protein pancakes and a skillet, is AMAZING! I wish they had a location close to me, because I would be there weekly. The protein pancakes had amazing flavor, texture, and size, and they used fresh blueberries. I tried the rancho skillet and the meat lovers, and both were fantastic. The serving size is filling, it'll be a feat if you can finish your plate. I love that they gave our party of 3 a carafe of coffee, so we didn't have to wait for refills. Service was great too. This place is a winner in every way."}
{"text":"They have a lot of options on the menu and usually you are seated quickly. Their service is pushy and servers don't seem to know the menu. They did make mistakes to my last two orders but did try to correct them. Food is decent and service is average"}
{"text":"This place was just built walking distance to my house, so I've been dying to check it out. Although, to be honest, I've been to US Eggs before and they were just fine... just a good ol' breakfast place.  After perusing the menu, I noticed that their Protein Pancakes had a star next to them, showing that they were a specialty. Then I noticed that even the t-shirts on the waitstaff mentioned their Protein Pancakes. You know what this means?! I'm SO ordering some Protein Pancakes!  And wowzer, was that a FANTASTIC idea! These things were amazing. There was no protein powdery mix in these! Fresh blueberries, almonds and oatmeal mixed with some pancake mix of sorts. De-lish! Definitely worth the trip just for those babies!"}
{"text":"U.S. Egg is a great place for breakfast food. I met a networking contact for breakfast there this morning and had the Hawkeye omelet with a dry English muffin and fruit.  Everything food-wise was perfect.  The fruit was very fresh.  They didn't mess up a dry English muffin (you'd be surprised at how many restaurants can't keep the butter off my muffin ).  The omelet itself was fantastic. Filled with perfectly cooked chicken and bacon, fresh, ripe avocado and fresh tomato.  A slab of cheese (Colby I think) on top was like icing on the cake. Another great part of the omelet for me was that it wasn't greasy at all like you find in some places. Light, fluffy and flavorful.   The service at the restaurant was good. The waitress did forget the Cholula that I had asked for, but made up for it with a sincere apology and perfect attentiveness for the rest of the meal.    The one downside was that the coffee...weeeeeeell...the coffee sucked.  I'm a bit of a coffee snob, but I don't know anyone who would say it was great.    Still, I cannot deny that this was a great breakfast place. I recommend it and will go there again soon!"}
{"text":"It's our favorite go to spot for a great and quick breakfast. My girlfriend's been coming here weekly for over a year. We really feel like VIPs when we bring the little one. The food is great, everyone loves the protein pancakes. Quick and friendly service and our orders are ways hot, fresh and out quick.   We keep coming back each week and will continue to do so! Thanks again y'all."}
{"text":"Perfectly Fine  I am so glad I stumbled onto US Egg on Bell Road.  What a terrific find this was for breakfast.  One thing I truly appreciate about US Egg,  there is \"No Waiting\" you're always greeted and seated immediately.    US Egg has plenty of seating with a full and friendly staff ready to accomdate your every need .  US Egg offers an extensive menu for breakfast with all your breakfast favorites. Your entree is prepared as you ordered and the portions are large.   I would highly recommend US Egg for breakfast, especially if you're really hungry. Whatever you like: egg dishes, pancakes, waffles, etc. they have it. Tip: if you're not a hearty eater, ask for a half-size portion. It's still a lot of food."}
{"text":"First off I had a patty melt at their location on Scottsdale Rd in 2008 , worst burger I ever had in my life . Had a lot of bad burgers in my life , but this one stood out so bad I never went back . They had a new location by Kinkos were I had some business to attend to so in  August I went there and had some Corned Beef hash , expensive but great .   Went back and took my wife , ordered 2 hungryman breakfast $12.95 comes with a 1/2 lb burger patty .Order them medium , explained to the waitress that by that I wanted it HOT , Juciy , pink in the center . Both my wife and I got COLD , raw burgers , . I returned my and got back the 2008 burger again , burnt dry and tougher than a piece of shoe leather . The Manger had no excuse , but did take off the price of th burger itself ,  You know what I worked hard for that $30 , went out to have a nice meal with my wife and you RUINED IT , I have to earn that money again and try to find time to go out again . YOU and your café SUCK"}
{"text":"Breakfast with Dave! Sense a theme here?  Reviews were spot on! Seated within 10 seconds on a Saturday morning, place was packed!  Service was amazing! Food was served as though they knew we were coming and knew what we wanted...they were that fast! It was delicious!  Come prepared to peruse the menu though as there are so many things to choose from! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the better breakfast places I've been to. The menu is HUGE and service was on point. I like that it's not a huge chain so there's nore of a \"hometown\" feel. It gets really busy during the weekend mornings especially, but the bar is open seating..."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch and great service! The waitress had accidentally taken our order wrong but had the correct order out to us within two minutes. Great portion sizes"}
{"text":"A pretty typical breakfast/brunch place. A little pricey for average tasting food. The protein waffle was delicious though. It's not really a high protein pancake, because the batter is the same as the regular pancakes, but it does have almonds and granola in it, which I guess adds a little bit of protein? My brother in law also really liked his plain pancakes. My mom ordered the New Yorker omelette, which was just ok. The hollandaise sauce was really thick and yellow for some reason, more like a gravy than your traditional hollandaise. But it was fine because it was the only flavor to the otherwise bland and dry omelette. Hash browns were bland, but maybe it's so that you can tailor the taste to your preference. Overall I wasn't wowed by the food, except for the protein waffle!"}
{"text":"It was decent to good.  The protein pancakes are very good.  The sausage, bacon, and sides are maybe average.  The service was good at times and then the server would seem to get lost and not come back.  Either way, it's breakfast and it's a decent little place.  However, the Farmhouse in old town Gilbert is much better."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, so they must be doing something right. The protein pancakes are to die for. Service is quick and friendly. Food is always delicious too."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices. Service was a couple notches above most. Clean, bright premises. Heading back now"}
{"text":"Went to US Egg for a change up from the hotel breakfast as eating the same breakfast for 6 days straight did get tiresome even though it was great each day. Well...we should have maybe made it 7 days at the hotel, the service and food were mediocre but the coffee was awful. By no means are we Starbucks people and usually find better coffee at smaller diners but was sure wrong on this one. The menu did allow us to try chicken and waffles but even that was pretty standard."}
{"text":"Pretty good food always packed on Sundays...I'd be suspect if they weren't... good healthy fresh food...."}
{"text":"Yummy Bloody Mary's. Great large portions. I got a skillet and still had to take home and my dB and I ate it again the fill morning for breakfast."}
{"text":"Always love getting brunch here on a weekend. Wait time is alright seeing as they always have plenty of people. Also, very pet friendly place!"}
{"text":"Eh (shoulder shrug) not great not terrible. Had breakfast here at 6:30 on a Sunday and was not impressed. It wasn't terrible but just nothing great about it. I had a spinach and cheese omelette, it was a good size but the hash browns are very strange and the toast was even off some how. Servers were super sweet but it just definitely was not a home run here. We will try other breakfast joints and leave this one to those that love protein pancakes, they were trying to sell those pretty hard.  French toast was again just blah... Moving on from us egg.."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting but I've ordered the protein pancakes and they was awesome. My waitress Iris was attentive and brought me back a large pitcher of water. My next visit would be on a Sunday to checkout the brunch."}
{"text":"Always love this place because of the many food options, the quality of the food, and especially the service.  Also, Gebran (the owner of the Scottsdale location) and his brother have running a restaurant down to a science. It is like a well oiled machine. The way that they run the servers, turn the tables, have prompt service, and leave pitchers of beverages at your table so you don't have to wait is amazing.  Very broad menu options to satisfy everyone.  Tons of parking.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day with some family, ordered a California Benedict which include 2 poached eggs with avocado and bacon. My order came with a side of hash browns, wasn't really a fan. Hash browns were mushy and had no flavor. Service was great! We had a birthday and they brought us out some ice cream which was nice. Overall a pretty good place!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've missed trying this place, after over a decade of living in the Valley, partly as an ASU student in need of a good hang-over recovery joint. I can't believe I relied exclusively on the IHOP on Apache Blvd, all those years in Tempe. Dammit!  It was packed on the New Year's Day morning I came here with a friend. The service was a bit slow but on par with my expectations for a jam-packed popular breakfast joint on New Year's Day. I ordered a calorie-laden Cajun skillet with scrambled eggs. I'm knocking off a star because the chicken pieces were too dry for my taste. But the rest of the skillet was very good. The service was friendly and professional. Wildcats beware, lots of ASU students within."}
{"text":"We were not impressed walking in to a host at the stand who finished his text message while greeting us. Table was very sticky and needed to ask busser to use a wet  rag, rather than a napkin...Coffee was cheap store brand I avoid buying for home. Waitress was poorly attentive and only refilled drinks when we stopped her from passing us. Not happy when we called her over from social hour. Food was rather yummy and would recommend it but took a while to be served. Very average but a little high priced. And benches are very uncomfortable, like slotted park bench. :("}
{"text":"After picking up our rental car we decided to have breakfast and came upon this restaurant which supplied our needs. We were able to have eggs on a muffin and juice in a clean, bright environment. There was also free Wifi which for the traveller is a bonus."}
{"text":"Been coming here couple times & alway pleased. Very clean looking place, large room, good services, fantastic well-done food, reasonable prices ."}
{"text":"The only reason I go back here is because my boyfriend and I really enjoy the food and it is extremely close to my house. Honestly though, the service is terrible. The last 3 times we have gone, we sat down and then were never acknowledged by a server. Employees walked past our table continuously for 15 mins until we finally got up and asked the hostess if there was anyone to take care of us. It is so frustrating to see so many employees walk past us, when we clearly haven't been taken care of yet and no one gave a shit. Please please train your team to acknowledge your guests... even if you can't take care of them right away, at least say something so we know someone will be with us. Other then that, we really enjoy your food. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast and this was one of the top rated in Tempe so I decided to try it. The parking lot was full and the line was long but I was ushered right in because I was alone and only needed a table for one (one of the only perks of eating alone). The staff was young and energetic. The atmosphere was upbeat and positive. The menu is extensive with several traditional breakfast (and lunch options). I ordered the french toast and a side of hash browns. The French toast was very good. I personally would have preferred it slightly more browned but it was still really good! The hash browns were amazing; not to greasy with a mix of crispy on the top and well cooked in the middle. They have free wifi so I was able to use my computer while eating. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out, and it was actually okay. I got the Belgian waffle and sweet potato fries. The waffle was good, and crisp. I really came here for a waffle but would go back for the sweet potato fries. My grandma can't taste, and goes by texture so she asked for her hash brown extra crispy and our server offered to deep fry them. Although probably not so healthy it was really good! And my grandma loved them, and loved that our server catered to what we like! She was very friendly and helpful, I though the food could have come out a little faster, but then again maybe I was just hungry. And im sure what we ordered takes some time to cook more. All in all, I like the place and will be back for more sweet potato fries;)"}
{"text":"Delicious, quality food. Love the atmosphere, the staff is wonderful! Annndddd they got Protein waffles and pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"Soooo, it is a laid back Saturday for once, lol Still my favorite breakfast spot!  I had the triple play wirh the most awesome pancakes. I love the thin and light fluffy pancakes. Bacon cooked perfect.  The portions here are huge. I could not finish it all.  My hubby had the biscuits and gravy plate.  He finushed it, barely!!   I recommend you bring your appetite! One other note,  I have OCD when it comes to drink wares such as coffee mugs etc..  the staff is always accommodating to give me coffee in a clear mug or use the clear pilsner glasses for my tea.  They are awesome here!!!!"}
{"text":"We never travel west without stopping for breakfast in Phoenix at US Egg on Baseline. We love the quality of the food and especially enjoy the protein pancake. This restaurant is always quick and friendly. We started traveling in the west 20 years ago and have not found a breakfast to compare with what is offered at US Egg. Try it when in Phoenix, lots of location but we stay near Baseline and go to that restaurant each time."}
{"text":"Love US Egg! My dad and I go once a month! Usually have an omelet but have had chicken fried steak as well as the BLT. Always friendly and wanting to go back! Food is great!"}
{"text":"You won't find a better place for breakfast and lunch. They have the nicest staff who go the extra mile to help you with whatever you need. The management truly cares about the experience of the customer. The food is very home-styleesk and you're left with a very warm comforting feeling."}
{"text":"This place is right across from my apartment complex and my roommate and I love it! Its usually always busy, but we never wait long. We always have great service and the food is delicious. They have a gluten free menu and the gluten options are just as good! US Egg is one of my favorite breakfast places to eat at!"}
{"text":"I drive by this location on the weekends and there is always a line! This morning B and I wanted to have omelets somewhere and it was before 7:30am, so we went here. Not spectacular, but the place is clean, the staff is friendly, service was quick, and the food was good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the coffee is weak and they charge almost $3.00 a cup. We will probably go again when the mood strikes."}
{"text":"Great selection of breakfast and lunch foods. Prepare for a wait on weekends. Nice pation seating."}
{"text":"Wow! What a fantastic experience! The moment we walked in the manager personally greeted my friend and I and introduced himself, I felt very welcomed. Our server was so sweet and did her job to perfection. The food was the fabulous, I've never had such delicious pancakes!! Since my first time eating there (which was a week ago) Ive been back twice! Thank you U.S. Egg, I am now a regular!:)"}
{"text":"Let me keep this short.    I would rather go to Dennys for a comparable breakfast for WAAAAAYYYYYY less money!  There was nothing outstanding about the food or service here.  Prices are crazy high.  Pancakes are average and dry. God forbid they should actually give you any syrup for pancakes, it's like you are asking them to give you gold or something!  Goodness, you are serving dry pancakes, a little more than a miniature 1 ounce serving is an absolute necessary.  Oh and be careful, they try to upsell you with their \"protein\" pancakes to add more to the price - REALLY??!???!?!!?  protein pancakes???  If you are eating pancakes, this is not really even necessary.  They try to sneak that in when you order to charge you more so listen carefully to your servers.  For the same price and actually less, go to Good Egg.  Pancakes are light and fluffy and yes, they give you syrup!  Atmosphere and locations are much better and the restaurants are clean.  I felt like the place could use a good cleaning.  The silverware was very dirty - gross!    Only thing that was positive was the big pieces of bacon but buyer beware...if you purchase a breakfast meal that does not come with bacon, be ready to pay dearly for it as a side.  Over $3.59 for  bacon !!!!!!!  I'm sticking with The Good Egg.  I never worry about the places being dirty and feeling like I don't want to be there eating or that they are trying to screw me over by upselling pancakes."}
{"text":"in town for spring training and a friend recommended this restaurant to my husband. Pretty good, nothing great. their pancakes are wheat and they were not my favorite. I has the eggs Benedict and it was very good. staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Our first time here, got here just before closing and loved the food and service."}
{"text":"Despite being a red-blooded American male, I find this place a bit below average.  Yes, the waitress wander around in shorts that would make a cheerleader blush--but rail thin bottle blondes don't do anything for me or the food itself.    I've eaten here twice: the first time, I ordered huevos rancheros and coffee; today, I had the protein pancakes.  In both cases, the service was mixed and the food was bland.  My food came out quickly both times, but my server disappeared each time as well.  Today, I sat for 15 minutes until I was able to get the attention of a manger who located my server for me.   The food itself is not bad, but nothing to cheer about.  The protein pancakes were enormous and dense, but not nearly as flavorful as one expects from an item filled with almonds, blueberries, and cinnamon.  As others have noted, they'll ding you on side orders--sour cream, tomatoes, guacamole, and the like will all cost you a pretty penny for diner-quality stuff.  Finally, it doesn't affect the food, but the decor is garish and plain.  Remember that first apartment you got after college with the white walls and tan carpet?  This is basically the US Egg aesthetic."}
{"text":"This place is very expensive compared to any other breakfast place in the valley. They really don't offer larger portions of food or higher quality to bring the prices they are asking."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place.  No matter what location I end up going to, they are always great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast and/or brunch spot.   Honestly never had lunch there but I've had breakfast there numerous times at about lunch time. :) BEST THING about this... after a long hike or mtn bike ride... they have a whole protein section of the menu on the back that is perfect for after workouts.  They're almost always busy, sometimes wait can get up to 20-30 min during rush times but they serve fast but don't rush.  The place is great... just go... you'll agree :)"}
{"text":"I love the fact that they offer protein pancakes! I've never seen that before ... Plus they did not skimp on the avocado when it came to my omelet! ... Unfortunately I feel like I cannot judge the meal completely  because my food was cold ... Still it was good."}
{"text":"Driving home from NAU looking for a place to eat I checked out Yelp and found this place.  Walked in and we were greeted with smiles. Our server Emily was very friendly and when she found out we were from Los Angeles she gave us a free Blueberry Protein Pancake. It was very good. U.S. Egg is on our to do list next time we are in the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"Pros: English Muffin: super delicious, warm and moist Eggs with spinach: very good, flavorful Coffee: fragrant and tasty  Cons: Hashed Potatoes: bland Chili: too thick, too salty, rather pasty Wait: very, very long Service: a little slow  Conclusion: 3"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Wednesday at noon to find few patrons in the restaurant. Noticed high prices for lunch items - sandwiches between  $9-12. Ordered and waited 20 minutes for the meal. Grilled chicken sandwich ($11) came with very small rubbery (microwaved?) chicken breast, minimal avocado, soggy bread and not-quite melted cheese.  Side of coleslaw was old as indicated by the lack of crunch and the purple cabbage color seeping into the dressing.  Waitress offered to make it better, but I had lost my appetite.  Husband reported his $9 BLT was good, but fries tasted overdone and like they were cooked in old oil.  Person bussing table asked how everything was and left without waiting for a response.  Coffee was good, though.  Will not return."}
{"text":"My other half hates that they up charge you to substitute fruit for potatoes but I love that they have lots of healthy options. Our server Jessica was great and the manager is usually watching and keeping everyone on their toes. I've never had to wait to get seated here. Most recently we went on a Saturday and it was crowded and noisy and the seats are not terribly comfortable, hence the 4 star rating. But hey, you can get alcohol with your meal here!"}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by my breakfast here. The service was quick and attentive, but the food was just alright. I have had much better breakfasts."}
{"text":"The service is great!!! I also love how the leave you a jug on the table if you order coffee, tea, water, ect.. They were super fast and good at bringing out our food quick! And the protein pancakes are the bomb!"}
{"text":"The protein pancakes are a must try. I recommend the half and half to get the best of both worlds, but all items are awesome. Only tiny downside is that from time to time the coffee is lukewarm, but just ask for a fresh pot and you're good to go!"}
{"text":"This is One of my favorite breakfast spots in town. They sat me down as soon as I walked in and greeted me nicely. They order with a smile always, and always checked on me for refills and anything else I needed. The food was delicious & at a great temperature. I ordered a peanut butter sandwich desert and it was delicious. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Protein pancakes, eggs and an all angus beef patty! Oh how I love my protein infused breakfast. The service at this place is great the food is out of this world but be ready cause you will pay for what you get. They are not the cheapest spot in town but it is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible coffee. I ordered their traditional breakfast: 2 eggs, hashbrowns, muffin and added sausage. All were decent except the sausage. It tasted like it was freshly microwaved from the freezer.  Scenery: about what you'd expect, plain, looks like any other breakfast nook. The only thing notable was the very attractive female servers dressed as cowgirls. Considering it's close to Halloween, I'm not sure if that's part of their regular attire though.  The service was efficient and pleasant enough.  For the price you pay and quality of food, you'd be better served by hitting the ihop up the street."}
{"text":"I come here for the Protein Pancakes or Waffles. Great food. Coffee a little too bitter for my taste."}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast!  The half & half is my option for the veggie skillet & awesome protein pancakes!  And Bella is a joy"}
{"text":"Favorite Breakfast spot, their pancakes are so amazing and whole wheat, fast friendly service. I wish it was open longer. Ive only been here once so I have high expectations for the next time"}
{"text":"It's still great! The benedicts are my new favorite, the egg is poached just right, and the portion size is perfect. Love the new decor!"}
{"text":"A very busy restaurant for no-nonsense breakfast foods as well as burgers and sandwiches for lunch!  The food is fresh, affordable, and has plenty of variety to please even the pickiest eaters.  It was very easy to substitute any part of any order for something else on the menu.  The staff was friendly, attentive, and worked efficiently to deliver high quality food with a short wait time after ordering."}
{"text":"Just another breakfast place. The food was good and all but no better or worse than anywhere else really. And the value is really not there. A standard protein and eggs breakfast could be had for less at Dennys.   The eggs Benedict at around $11 was good but not memorable and certainly not plentiful for the price. I don't get the hype of breakfast places so if it's your thing then try it out. For me, it was a pretty ordinary, higher than average-priced meal."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot. It can get kind of crowded and you might have to wait a while. Once you get seated the service is very prompt. Our meal was served very quickly and it was very delicious. They have your standard breakfast menu here as well as some of their own breakfast specials. I tried the Border plate, which was like a frittata with chorizo and monterrey and cheddar cheese. It was very good. The chorizo was very delicious. Excellent breakfast place with good service"}
{"text":"This is the first location that U.S. Egg opened in the valley and now they have one in Scottsdale and plan on opening a 3rd in Chandler. It is a locally owned business by what I think are brothers. You can see them working at each of their locations from open to close. Their food is amazing and is perfect for lunch and breakfast. My business partner and I stopped in for lunch and to my pleasant surprise they have an entire menu dedicated to the Atkins and South Beach diets. I'm not officially on either of those diets but I do try to steer clear of carbs during lunch and dinner. This menu was built for me. I ended up ordering a grilled chicken breast with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, and avocado. It was delicious and I was in heaven. I will definitely be frequenting U.S. Egg more often."}
{"text":"We went to US Egg today & it was terrible! The place was packed, which made it excessively noisy. The service was very slow, and when our food finally arrived, half of our group was given a cold meal. My friend ordered bacon and it was so badly undercooked that it was inedible. I requested that the chef substitute bacon for the ham in my breakfast burrito, and they got it wrong and left the meat out completely.  We were very disappointed with the experience, and we we will not be back. I think this is a place that does not function well when they have a full restaurant all morning."}
{"text":"We come here pretty much weekly. It's a bit of a drive (we have a Good Egg about 10 minutes closer) but well worth it. The service is prompt and friendly, and you are always warmly greeted at the door. Protein pancakes are our favorite, try substituting apples for the blueberries for a new experience."}
{"text":"An outstanding, but pricey, breakfast place that's reminiscent of diners of the northeast with waitresses wearing the Daisy Duke version of khaki shorts without the fraying.   It's rare to drive by this place on a weekend morning and not see a crowd of people assembled outside. USE treats its customers waiting to get a seat well though. There's a coffee pot outside for patrons to help themselves. How many restaurants do that?  Word must have gotten around for this place on the corner of Mill and Baseline because I've run into fans in town for a Fiesta Bowl as well as the University of Arizona softball team (Had I of known the girls were going to win the national championship that season I would have gotten autographs).  A variety of different pancake options exist including protein pancakes. That means you could come straight here after a workout!  There's also a variety of different omelet options that most breakfast places in AZ don't offer. What's in a Denver omelet anyway?   What stood out for me was the Manhattan clam chowder. I was impressed the place even had it. Most places in AZ claim \"clam chowder\" on the menu and if you ask the server if it's Manhattan or New England, he or she doesn't know what you're talking about or says, \"the white one.\"  The Manhattan here was superb with a good tomato base and real minced clams.   USE does well as a breakfast/brunch place and that's where its real focus is. Last I knew it opened very early and closed at 2 p.m. I don't know if that's still the case.  For all I know the waitresses wear pants now. After all, it is winter.   A welcome change from the franchise breakfast places like IHOP, Denny's or Waffle House. Worth the extra money as well."}
{"text":"Food was not great and over priced a little salt and pepper during the cooking process goes a long way...I arrived before my mom sister and her two children. I told the girl we would need a high chair. Didn't get it until the car seat with baby inside sat on the floor for awhile. I ordered for my sis and I before they got there she had an appointment. When they arrived our server never offered them drinks. My mom ordered food and ate with no drink. She had to get her own silverware from another table. Very disappointing I work hard for my money I hate wasting it on crappy food and service."}
{"text":"This place is great. Everybody that works here is awsome. We have had a lot of the food off the menu I can't pick my favorite. It's great for lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We will gong back when we visit the area again. The service was very attentive especially the manager/host. The food was hot and came out in a good amount of and all together. The food was was good all around! I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We ate there for breakfast this past Sunday. Our food was good. Our issue was with the server. The place was pretty loud in there from all the other diners which is fine but she talked so softly everyone kept having to say \"what\" every time she said something. And then when our food came out instead of walking around the table to hand me my food she just reaches across my husband to give it to me. Then when she came to collect plates from those of us done eating instead of going around the table she then reaches across my husband once again only this time dragging the bottom of her shirt and jacket across his food."}
{"text":"This place is amazeballs. Their protein pancakes are really tasty. Their omelettes are delicious too. I appreciate how they give the tables a pitcher of water (and tea). Definitely helps for people like us that drink a lot of water."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, terrible food.  I had the Reuben sandwich my daughter had the turkey swiss sandwich.  Fries were extremely burnt on both plates and was inedible.  I'm surprised the cook put it on the plate, and even more surprised the waitress served it. A second waitress agreed and was going to make a new batch, but I declined. The sandwiches were salty and not tasty. Well, I'm crossing this restaurant for places to eat in the future.  I can see why very little people were eating there."}
{"text":"We found this gem of a place on Yelp and are so happy we did! We were greeted and seated right away, offered coffee, water, juice and served quickly. Our server was friendly and efficient. I ordered the Half & half which is a skillet of hash browns, your choice of toppings and 2 eggs with a side of 2 large, amazingly delicious protein pancakes. It was way too much food for one person so I took most of the pancakes to go. My husband had the traditional breakfast with hash browns, 2 eggs and sausage and it was a huge portion. Would highly recommend this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly not sure why I keep going back here, it's disappointing at best. I could go on and on with the many reasons, but I only gave this place two stars because I know it has potential. I'm just hoping that one day, one day, that I can order a poached egg and not have it delivered to the table under-cooked..Just once. If the name of your business has the word EGG in it, you should have the best egg cooks in town.   There's something about every business that's been in this suite; Good Egg / US Egg - Neither one could cook an egg to save their life.  Honestly, I don't think I'll ever be back..This was a last straw."}
{"text":"Five star reviews, really? Have you not been to Waffle House? The only reason this place gets two stars is the service which is quite good.   Do to poor grocery planning (running out of eggs at home) I ate here twice in the last ten days (closest breakfast place to my house). The first time was more of three star experience as the food was solid Waffle House quality, just a little expensive.   The second time was sad. I was on my way to South Mountain to go mountain biking and I starving, usually anything tastes good when you are really hungry but not at US Egg!  I ordered a fairly basic dish, the Western scramble and it seemed to take longer than normal to come out but I was starving so maybe my hunger just made it seem that way. Finally it arrives! It looks kind of runny and just odd, little clusters of cheese topped egg, pepper and ham clusters. It was runny and not hot, tasted a little under cooked and very bland. The hashbrowns were really greasy too. Normally I would politely point this out to my waitress but I was hungry and in a hurry to go ride. Then I got the check, $13 for a cold, runny Western Scramble and OJ! The same dish only tastier at IHOP, Dennys or Waffle House would of been $8.   As a business owner I really like to support local businesses but when their product is inferior to the chains and cost 50% more I will go to the chains.  Long story short, overpriced and under cooked with great service."}
{"text":"Breakfast done right... as everyone knows that is not an easy task.  The scamble eggs were fluffy and not over-cooked or dry.  They have an awesome protein pancake packed with oats and blueberries.  The skillet hash is amazing!  Only quality ingredients used here.  The portions are also huge so only come here if you want to leave stuffed.  It is difficult to stop eating when it is m-m-good!"}
{"text":"We live in Flagstaff and always end up here for breakfast when we are in town. The service is always excellent and the management is always friendly. And the food always taste good."}
{"text":"He had the Gentlemen's omelette which he said was perfect with the mushroom sauce. He added fresh jalapeño and spinach with a waffle on the side. I had the half and half with Chicken, bacon and tomato skillet...plus added fresh jalapeño and mushrooms.  The cran-mosa and pink Lemonaid-mosa was on point as well. Everything including the service was better than expected. Their menu is extensive to suit everyone's taste. One last thing...we arrived on this morning a little after 9am Sunday and there wasn't a wait to be seated. Well an hour later as we were leaving there was a line out the door with about 20+ people waiting for seating. So plan accordingly and go as early as possible to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've been eating at all of the U.S. Egg locations (Scottsdale, Tempe, and North Phoenix) for over 10 years... I used to go on a weekly basis because I love it so much! The service and the food is consistently great! Protein pancakes are a must!"}
{"text":"Great food and Grace was a great server. We had omelet and whole west pancakes. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our breakfast shayna was super nice her customer service was amazing. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Restaurant has an upscale diner feel to it. Very clean and the decor is really cute; really playful uses of eggs.  It wasn't busy when we went. I was surprised because it was Memorial Day. We were seated quickly and greeted by a friendly staff.  Our food came out very fast and it was piping hot. I ordered the half and half: turkey sausage, egg whites, onions, and peppers. My mother ordered the cornhusker. Both meals were huge and very filling. The protein pancakes are amazing. I really enjoyed the flavor and the heartiness they had. The skillet was very fresh, my only critique would be to sauté the peppers and onions just a little longer.  The food was delicious and came out fast. Reasonable pricing but they do upcharge for any substitutions. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had this spot all 4 years I lived in Arizona, it never seemed to disappointment. The restaurant is clean, service is fast/ attentive, and the menu is diverse. The food is flavorful, loved eating the skillets after a night out with friends, or enjoying some of the pancakes as well. The food comes out quick and the server is always asking if you need anything more etc.   I have ordered this food to-go menu times as well and it tastes just as fresh. A big thing as well as knowing how to package certain breakfast foods to-go and they do a great job with that. Always making sure the gravy is on the side for the skillet and things are in place for to-go orders. Overall nothing to say negative about this establishment, it does get crowded during the weekends but that is expected from a restaurant that knows what they are doing! Check it out if you are in the area and I am sure you will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I love going and trying new breakfast places. We decided to try the US Egg in Chandler and couldn't have been more satisfied. Even though there was a lot of people waiting, it didn't take long for us to get a seat. The manager was helping seat people and was incredibly welcoming. The waitress that sat us down was personal and friendly. We were immediately asked for our drinks and brought them shortly after. My fiancée had the chicken skillet and I had the half and half with protein pancakes and Santa Fe skillet. We were both really pleased with the promptness of the food, the freshness and overall taste. The service we received topped the food. One of the managers made a recommendation on our food which made our meals even more enjoyable. We would definitely go back to any US Egg in the Phoenix area!!!"}
{"text":"Went there this last Friday, as that's my \"breakfast out\" morning.   Thought I'd give it a try.   The former restaurant (Blue Plate Brunchery) in this location was just \"ok.\"    This isn't much better.    Eggs were ok, and it's hard to blow it on toast, but the bacon was so overdone that I thought it had to have been sitting under a warmer for quite awhile, and the potatoes were dry and I think \"out of a bag\" from some frozen pre-cut brand.    The plates are WAY too small, and everytime you tried to get a fork-full of potatoes they slid off the plate.    Coffee was burnt - tasted worse then the overcooked Starbucks brand.    Back to Village Inn for me."}
{"text":"I love this place. We come here fairly often because the food is always consistently good with reasonable prices. For first timers the protein pancakes are a must. I love them, they really don't need syrup because of the granola, berries, and cinnamon mixed in. Totally addictive--also try the skillets. In fact go for the half and half (half chicken and chorizo skillet and half order of protein pancakes). So amazing -- and you probably won't eat for the rest of the day! I also love that you get pitchers of your bevy -- which is so exciting for an iced addict like me!"}
{"text":"My favorite goto breakfast spot! The protein pancakes are the best! I always get a half and half with the pancakes and the Santa Fe skillet (green chile, chicken, chorizo). It's so good! I have never had a bad thing there. Their service is second to none. The servers are great; always happy and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Wanted check out this place. Heard it was a good place to eat. They were correct its good."}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast place. Not too pricey either. The portions are large and the food is delicious. The biscuits and gravy are good, chocolate chip pancakes were fantastic. Skillets were nice as well. Defiantly a good spot. Pretty close to Brigades Barber shop if you want a bite after your cut."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The owners come by to make sure you are being taken care of. The waitress was very upbeat and attentive. The California eggs benedict was a great choice!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre.  Nothing exciting or unique about this restaurant.  However, it was clean and service was prompt. I would have liked to see more vegetarian and gluten free options.  It was just okay."}
{"text":"This is generally a really good breakfast spot. But as of recently it has been hit or miss at this location. I have an amazing meat lovers scramble which seems to be a really good stand by if I don't want to be dissapointed.  The shredded hash browns took a while and were cool and uncooked. This is been standard the past 2 times we have been there.   We will go back and hopefully they can redeem themselves."}
{"text":"Decided to venture out and try this place we have heard so much about. The staff is very sweet, polite and speedy. The food was delicious, great portions and hot. The restaurant is clean and has a great homey feeling to it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is simply one of the best breakfast restaurants in town. US Egg has great pricing, amazing food, and a super friendly staff. We've been eating here for years and have never had a bad experience. My husband will tell you to try the pancakes, I'll tell you to try an omelette. Either way, I'm pretty sure you win."}
{"text":"This place is always as expected.  But ironically they overcooked my daughters eggs! So we were almost done by the time she started.  We will be back their breakfast menu is great and usually so is the food.  It is diner food. And in that category with 5 stars available they are 4."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great and the gorgeous staff with their great service makes a must go to breakfast spot. The only complaint was that the steak was a little dry."}
{"text":"US Egg is one of those places that you walk in and feel like your family owns the restaurant.  People are super friendly and things just kinda move slower in this world - and that's not necessarily a bad thing in my opinion!  It's one of my go-to breakfast places in Tempe as they have great omelets with just about anything you can dream of.  My personal favorite is mushroom and spinach.  Everything is served with an english muffin and potatoes.    They also have a lunch menu but I wouldn't come here for that really.  Some seem to like it, but this is breakfast only for this gal!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter from ASU for brunch today. My daughter had the chicken fried steak with eggs,hash browns,and muffin. Steak was delish with just the right breading and crisp hash browns. I had an egg salad sandwich with fresh fries. I don't like fries usually,but these really taste great. The egg salad had a lot of flavor. Yes we took home leftovers. My only complaint was the pineapple on my plate was not ripe,but then I never expected it either to be a garnish. Love the idea of leaving a pitcher of ice tea on the table to refill at my leisure. They also brought two glasses of lemonade at the same time. Great idea. Fast and great service for lunch time!"}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix for a wedding and to see my sister. On the way t rehearsal and we decided to stop in at this breakfast place and must I say, hands down to this place. Awesome food! We had the traditional breakfast with bacon and chorizo. Food was on point. Waitress and the people here were so friendly. Gotta go back before we leave!"}
{"text":"Service at this location is a bit slow or I would give this 5 stars. The food is fresh and good portions. If you have not tried the protein pancakes you are missing a real treat! Don't go to this location in October before checking the bar next door for their annual motorcycle club breast cancer awareness ride. Our leisurely Sunday morning breakfast was accompanied by 50 to 60 Harley Davidson motorcycles riding up to the bar next door to imbibe at 10:00 a.m. Who does that!! It was good people watching at least! We sat outside so the exhaust fumes where a bit much. The Chandler location is much quieter!"}
{"text":"Been here several times. This place has some good food and a nice selection on their menu. I always like their eggs benedict here. Make sure you sit inside if you want to have a cocktail."}
{"text":"Service is fast, friendly and attentive.  Food is slightly better than average at the price point.  I had the patty melt and fries.  Patty melt sandwich is small, flavor is ok.  Fries were ok.  Servers all had smiles on their faces.  Unless breakfast is better there would be nothing swaying me to choose this place over First Watch or other competition."}
{"text":"Not too bad. ..nothing major to comment on positive or negative.   I had biscuits and gravy with eggs (they forgot to bring my eggs) I mentioned it to the waitress when I finally got a hold of her and at that point we were finished.  She didn't really care no discount or anything.   Aside from that the biscuits and gravy were decent. NOTE TO ANYONE READING THIS I AM STILL SEARCHING FOR THE BEST BISCUITS AND GRAVY IN TOWN PLEASE MESSAGE ME.  It is my favorite breakfast and haven't found my place yet.   I live off N. 67th Ave. I do have to say the French Toast my daughter had was top notch.   I would go here if I had a hankering for it."}
{"text":"The combo plate where you can get the protein pancakes is 5 stars. The other items are all excellent but I like this combo. Good service and great bathrooms make this a solid place fur breakfast."}
{"text":"Opens early and offers perfect service and food. Employees were extremely welcoming, menu extensive and service quick. Offered fresh fruit instead of potatoes, coffee and water carafes on your table, and even offered me a to go cup. Can't go wrong visiting here."}
{"text":"After trying to hit up two other breakfast locations (which were both under construction), used my trusty Yelp app to find US Egg.  Menu is full of all the traditional breakfast favorites and has a special section for items with a higher lever of Protein.  We ordered the Protein Pancake (which was really tasty...bit of a cinnamon flavor) and the Spinach Omelette.  Both were very good....and just the right amount.  Atmosphere is somewhat uneventful, but the food and service are very good."}
{"text":"This is just an observation so I don't know how many stars to put for this but have you ever noticed that all the girls who work at US Egg are all around the same age, all very pretty, and all wear short shorts? Just a random feminist kind of thought on a sunny day. Don't get me wrong-still love it there!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in the North Phoenix area. I come here often with friends for lunch and breakfast.  My personal favorite is the Sun Devil omelet. It's so good and so flavorful.  Ingredients are always fresh and the food is always filling while being very affordable."}
{"text":"food was 100% the service was horrible went there this morning  simple eggs and pancakes for breakfast the waitress came to the table 2 times i had to just put cash on table and leave"}
{"text":"If you like bloody Mary's my oh my is this the place to go! Had probably one to many and the girlfriend had to drive home because I couldn't stop! Now on to the food, the Idaho meat lovers plate was everything I wanted and more I couldn't get over the fact that there was so much on my plate!! Only downside it took about 30 mins just to order my food and another 30 to get it, I get that it's a busy place but that's easy to fix!"}
{"text":"You got to try the protein pancakes!!!!!!!! The best pancakes I have ever tried!"}
{"text":"We had a little family gathering for breakfast here today.  I have eaten at their 7th Street location numerous times, but it's been a while and I was craving their protein pancakes so we decided to try the Bell Rd. location.  Very busy, not a long wait at all.  Friendly server, hot food delivered quickly.  No waiting for refills.  They got it right!  Everyone's food was delicious and very fresh.  We will be back.  P.S. Their sweet potato fries were just a step above others I have tried.  Loved them."}
{"text":"Omg. This place was so insanely good. Got pancakes, club sandwich, egg salad sandwich and tuna salad sandwich. The fries were great and the food too. The egg salad could have used more flavoring and the pancakes cooked a bit more but it was all really great. DEFINITELY order the oj. It was so fresh"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place since it's so close to my work and I'm sick of heavy food that most of the other fast food places have around here.   I ended up being disappointed before I even got my food. I went online to their menu to see what they had to offer. I knew I wanted a dinner salad and I also decided to get a sandwich. I ended up going with their egg salad sandwich. On their website the sandwich is priced at $7 and some change. I also subbed out the fries for a dinner salad for an extra charge of $1. When I went in to pick up my order it was over $10 for a sandwich and small dinner salad. Once I got my receipt the sandwich was actually over $8.   The food was not worth $10. I went back to work to eat and when I opened the to-go box and they had put all the egg salad on one side of the sandwich. The egg salad was also very runny and really bland. The bread was the only thing that had some flavor. I added some salt and pepper to it hoping it would make it taste a little better. It really didn't. So I ended up paying $10 for something that was tasteless and a runny mess.   The only thing that was good was the dinner salad and the crackers.  The food isn't worth the money. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is our all time favorite place for breakfast! The staff is excellent and runs like clockwork, never a need to ask for a refill.... They are on it. Great management and from the protein pancakes to omelets, burgers, salads and even chili. Good food and great place!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. This was my first visit. The customer service is exceptional and the food is divine. I highly recommend the breakfast. Their portions are filling with enough to take home if you're not an overeater. Looking forward to going back for a lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our way back from El Paso as we headed to Los Angeles and the food was delicious! The service was not the best, but it could have only been a one time thing as I have heard plenty of good things about this place. We would definitely go back the next time we are in town! great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great menu for all kinds of hunger levels and dietary restrictions.  In and out of there quickly and the water cup never went dry.  All the best signs of a b-fast joint!"}
{"text":"Eww so gross. Got a simple omelet that ended up being 11 bucks- salsa was gross, egg were so greasy I couldn't even eat it. Will not be returning. BreAkfast is not that hard to do."}
{"text":"Very good. Restaurant is clean and the staff is very welcoming and helpful. Traveled to Phoenix from LA and love to try new breakfast places. I was not disappointed. The protein pancakes were great and the bacon was perfect."}
{"text":"I really dig this place!  The only problem with the U.S. Egg is that it is too far from my house.  I love that their pancakes are whole wheat!  I can find no other breakfast places that are \"fiber-friendly\"  with their 'cake stacks.  If I wanted a stack of average white pancakes I would save some money and Bisquick!  Their protein pancakes are sweeeet!  They are hearty, filling and tasty!  I wish that I could give an honest eval. on the rest of their menu but I am strictly monogamous with the Protein Pancakes.  This place is not your ordinary pancake hut!"}
{"text":"Place came highly recommended, so I gave it a try.  When I walked in, one thing caught my attention, and it wasn't about the food, and I kept seeing it during my stay.  It was the owner, or manager, or whoever the guy was, who seemed to enjoy making a public spectacle of running/supervising the serving staff.  I certainly would't want to work for whoever that guy is...and I just came in for breakfast, I really didn't want to see this over achiever do his supervisory thing in such a public fashion.  Getting to the food, the coffee was so-so, and overpriced.  Perhaps cause they give you a pot full of coffee to pour if you're interested; i just wanted one cup but guess this way they can charge for more...  Had the chicken fried steak, and of course it's a matter of personal taste, I just didn't find it tasty, particularly the gravy.  For the few weeks I'm here, am going for breakfast elsewhere.  Atmosphere too commercial, the guy supervising was distracting, the coffee was overpriced for what i wanted, and the food i ordered, didn't hit my spot."}
{"text":"First time here! I ordered the Bay Area French Toast, the fb had the traditional breakfast. Both of us were surprised at how much food there was on the plates and how fast they came out (we came at the prime time breakfast hour, on a Sunday no less)."}
{"text":"A little on the high side but their waffles..... so good! And the Eggs Benedict.  They do get fairly busy but the wait time is less than 20 minutes.  You have indoor or outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Loved our breakfast here last Saturday. Service and food was good. There was no wait for a table. I ordered the half & half Bacon, Onion, Peppers Idaho hot skillet with protein pancakes. The portion was generous as it was enough for me and my hubby. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Always a good experience here.  Always friendly staff.  Great selection of food. Food really good too.  Biggest downfall is the price! Way overpriced for breakfast! Seems like they have raised the prices again.  Was too expensive before that! It seems like the portion size is smaller too,"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Saturday. We were really impressed and will certainly come back again. The pancakes were amazing!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went for breakfast this morning and got the meat lovers hash brown skillet, de-light-ful! The servers were so nice and helpful , we really enjoyed our first visit and will definitely be back. What really stood out is that the gentlemen that was seated next to us , seemed to had nodded off, we didn't think much of it as he was older and I could hear him breathing, But the owner came over to him and woke him up out of concern and spoke to him so kindly and inquired about his health and didn't leave his side until he knew he was ok, even after he kept his eye on him. I was really impressed by the whole experience."}
{"text":"So good.  Yesterday morning I had the pleasure of having breakfast here.  The place is pretty much a replica of The Good Egg in decor and set-up.    I had The New Yorker omelet minus the chicken, plus the Cajun sauce.  It had cheese, spinach, and tomatoes .  I got to substitute the chicken for mushrooms which made it pretty much perfect for me.  The Cajun sauce was a great addition.  I went the egg white route, also.  It was served with some tasty potatoes and a muffin.    My water was refilled often and our service was fast and consistent.  Our wait was only about ten minutes on this fabulous Saturday morning.  I'm sure I'll be back to U.S. Egg on groggy weekend mornings for a tasty omelet."}
{"text":"I was hoping to be WOWED when I came in for breakfast based on all the good reviews but it just wasn't anything special I ordered a pancake combo with strawberries on top and it was good just nothing I would come back for. The service was really nice though and the restaurant was really clean but besides that I feel like it's comparable to a Dennys or an IHOP."}
{"text":"Today was a bad day at the U.S. Egg. My friend and I were sat and greeted by the server right away. I was pleased. We got our coffee and waters in good time and our order was taken. We noticed our food was taking a while and no sign of our server Emily, 40 minutes passed by and finally we get our food to find out our over medium eggs were over cooked and our food was ridiculously cold (really). The host/supervisor who sat us came by and noticed the disappointment and took care of another order of food. There goes another 20 mins to get our food. We didn't order anything special out of the menu. It was so frustrating seeing people come in and leave while we were still waiting for our food. But I guess it we got a great deal because they took care of our \"coffees\" after freaking wasting a damn hour for our food. I work in the service industry and they could have done better than just coffees. Emily tried to apologize many times and the girl did her best. I tipped her her 20% because many times is not the servers fault but shame on management."}
{"text":"The perfect place for breakfast. This spot is kid/family friendly and caters to all types of diners and diets.  I wanted to try the protein pancakes - but also wanted something savory - the half and half was the dish of morning food dreams. I got everything I wanted - and they put an egg on it!  The pancakes were yum, the egg a perfect over easy and the veggie scramble good (needed a bit more salt on the potatoes).  My hubby's eggs Benedict was also cooked just right and my mother in law was pleased as punch with her 'crispy' bacon!  Great spot! Great food and generous portions!"}
{"text":"Awesome menu great food and service. It's the best breakfast we've had in Phoenix! Our waitress was thorough and honest, no selling techniques   We went back 2 days later and went outside the box on menu items, we were very impressed"}
{"text":"This place has amazing breakfast. I always take my family and friends here if they want good food."}
{"text":"Great (friendly&fast) service, wide selection on the menu, good food! Quality dishes inspired by the Southwest (olé!), Midwest (yee-haw!), or just plain ol traditional breakfast... It's all solid. The meal itself didn't knock my socks off... would have appreciated a bit more seasoning... but it was more than decent!! I can see why my gramps comes here every week. Delicioso."}
{"text":"Bacon is 6 Stars!  Service was 5 Stars... and the Food portions were good but we thought it was just a little pricey for breakfast."}
{"text":"We love coming here. Portions are definitely large, so come in hungry! I always get Eggs Benedict with avocado and it's a fantastic, filling, delicious brunch. Staff is always pretty quick with service and beverage refills, despite how busy they usually are, so props to them!"}
{"text":"In Arizona visiting a friend. This is his go to stop for breakfast. Overall food was good,With some pretty good timely service, (was actually surprised how quickly the food came out.) Definitely worth stopping at if you're looking for a nice breakfast stop in AZ."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place a lot. However, this was my first time back in over a year.  I love that the owners are always present.  That's probably the only consistent thing about the place.  The service was super slow compared to my last visit and the food was just eh. I'm not sure the changes they've made over the last year or so are working out.  It was my partners first time and he thought it was like an upgraded Denny's.  I'm super sad that it's not as great as it used to be."}
{"text":"A great find nearby and certainly worth the trip. I had the power pancake which was huge and filling and definitely worth trying as stated on the menu.  A side of bacon with that proved to be filling enough to get me through the day. Hubby went with his standard omelet, of cheese. Nothing too thrilling but he did say the hash browns were under seasoned which is a big no no in both of our books. Seems like a family place and overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Came her with my girl for something different. Protein pancakes were a great pick. She chose the The New Yorker omelette, both delicious choices. Definitely a weekend spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped by first thing in the morning. Had a protein waffle with blueberries, bacon and coffee. Good service and hey, the waffle was delicious. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service.  One of our favorites for breakfast.  Don't leave without trying the Protein Pancakes, they're awesome.  Bring a little patience, the secret is out and they get crowded, but they work the line down quickly."}
{"text":"Very good food excellent service , having the meat lovers skillet excellent wow what a find in Tempe Az"}
{"text":"Amazing, everything the staff is amazing with our family every time we eat here ., they seat us immediately and are attentive to my son who has autism., I couldn't recommend a better place to eat breakfast at the management is amazing the food is so good!!  I highly recommend if you have a family or just looking to get out for breakfast to check this place out"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Same great food service as Tempe.  This location is only a few miles from my house."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Portion sizes are huge, it's no wonder why athletes dine there. Protein pancakes are fluffy and delightful. I always get the half and half skillet and pancake option. They have a variety of skillets to choose from for different taste buds. My personal favorite is the meat lovers skillet. The different types of meat on a bed oh hash browns, an egg, and they too it off with gravy. I always bring my guests who visit here for breakfast. Two thumbs up for their excellent customer service and wait times."}
{"text":"Ordered the half and half with the sante fe skillet. The skillet was okay, but the protein pancakes were better. Tasty and cooked well.   Our original waitress was very rude, condescending when we had questions about our orders and said to my mom \"you're killing me.\" After we told the manager, he switched our waiter.. She was exceptional.   As for the ambience, very open and spacious, with light background music.  No wait at all at prime lunch time hours on a Saturday! They also have a nice outdoor patio.."}
{"text":"My BF and I were in town for the Insight Bowl (won by ISU 14-13!! YAY!!) and were staying at the BW nearby.  On NYE, we were looking for breakfast and there was a Denny's next door.  Since we knew what to expect at Dennys (not bad food), we decided to try something new and unique.  We've seen several US Eggs around so decided to give it a go!.  I ordered the bisquits and gravy with country potatoes and my BF ordered a denver omelet.  Both were good, but nothing special.  The bisquits were soft and the gravy had small bits of sausages.  I've had better.  The potatoes serving was fairly large tho.  The omelet was ok, not as big as IHOP, but decent.  Service was good for a big crowd day... had to wait about 15 min and the servers were quick and friendly.    It was good, but we'll probably stick with the chains."}
{"text":"Great omelettes, great steak, great Bloody Mary's. visiting friends and after getting off the plane we stopped here. My wife and I shared the guacamole and cheese omelette. Friends had the steak and eggs. The steak was more of a dinner steak--huge and thick, perfectly done. This is a great place for breakfast and brunch. Service was great!  A must do again."}
{"text":"This was another place that had a great breakfast. My best friend and his wife come here about every Sunday.  I had a omelet,  jack cheese, sour cream, avocado with hash browns and wheat toast. Dad got the omelet with egg whites Best friends got one of the skillets  And his wife got the bacon and eggs Everyone really enjoyed their food,  and of course we had a great time.  Server was very nice, sorry I can not remember her name.   Parking is shared with the other shops near by, but easy to find a spot.  We were there by 9am so we got right in, but by the time when we were leaving there was a lot of people waiting. Only compliant was the salsa, there was too many tomatoes and not much of any thing else,  I love salsa on my hash browns  But  i do like green jalapeño sauce on my eggs. Not too picky about the brand,  today was Tabasco. Very yummy"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! My order came out incorrect, however, the waitress had the kitchen remake it and it came out in only a few minutes. Staff is super friendly and efficient. A must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place! Always great service and the owner is great! Always remembers us and the wait is never longer than 15 minutes. Food is always on par."}
{"text":"This breakfast visit stood out to me the other day for this main reason: curtousy. I walked in with a group of 10 people. We were greeted upon entering and when we asked if they could make room for a party that big, they responded, Absolutely! Just give us two minutes! They probably did it in less. The waitresses were patient with our crowd who were a little indecisive with our orders, always had water and juice refilled quickly. Also, the waitress was thoughtful when I wanted just one pancake to go with my omlette, she suggested the kids pancakes because the regular size would be rather large. Then the kids pancakes came in the shape of mickey mouse heads. Yaya! Also, their food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast, generous portions, reasonable prices. I really liked everything, including the atmosphere and service. It checked all my boxes for a great breakfast! My brother in law didn't care for his biscuits and gravy, but he can be kind of picky so it was probably just him! I would definitely go back if ever near one again."}
{"text":"Ugh probably my new favorite breakfast place!!! So glad I found this gem, because I'm not typically a breakfast person. My favorite thing that my boyfriend introduced me to-- the PROTEIN PANCAKES. Whole wheat pancake batter mixed with blueberries, granola, almonds, & cinnamon. Not only are they delicious but good for you too! It's a win win. If you just want pancakes you can order that but beware of your portions cause just the pancakes alone are the size of a large plate! & it comes with two. Or you can do what I had this morning which was the \"Half & Half\". Comes with two small protein pancakes, and a half order choice of one of their Idaho Skillets. I got the Santa Fe Skillet, which comes with hash browns, eggs, cheese, chicken, chorizo, tomatoes, and a green chile sauce on top. Very flavorful. All for $11 bucks. Couldn't even finish it! Which is okay cause now I'll have leftovers for tomorrow :) One more cool thing that's kind of different, whatever drink you order they bring a pitcher and leave it at your table so that you don't have to wait for the waiter to bring you more drink! Love it. PEOPLE GO HERE!   :)"}
{"text":"First time here and my wife and I both had the club salad. The salads were huge and very fresh. Bianca was our server and she was great! She even offered us two ice tea's to go at no charge! We will definitely be back to try their breakfast menu. It looked great!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just not a breakfast person. I wasn't too impressed with lunch either.  Food is fresh, there are healthy options. I'm just never blown away.  Although I would eat here over a Denny's-like restaurant any day."}
{"text":"I came here with a few coworkers and loved it. Service was a little slow but I wasn't in a hurry so I didn't mind. I love that they offer healthier options, also. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  The food is always great, and the staff as well.  Prefer this location to the chandler one because this is the original.    Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"So my last day before I left Arizona to Philly I came here super early in the morning to find this place open :D I had a great last meal with some friends and then dipped.  I must say that for a last meal the eggs Benedict was on point. I love breakfast foods and they did the poached egg great. Wasn't a huge fan of the hollandaise sauce but it was still all very tasty."}
{"text":"Legs do indeed sell eggs.  It must be written somewhere that quality breakfast places must have jaw droppingly hot servers.  Believe it or not though the girls here are reason number two I've been a regular customer for the last ten plus years...reason number one...the breakfasts are just ridiculously good.  So, for me, the best validation of any recommendation is if the one I recommended something to turns around and does the same for others.  So, in this case, not only have the people I've taken here become regulars, they tell others who become regulars, and some have even gone on to work here.  Basically, this place sets the standard of quality breakfast places in my book.  The menu is, for the most part, a standard breakfast lunch menu.  Their specials are really good but THE signature item is the Protein Pancake.  They ruined me...they've ruined others.  What the fuck are we supposed to do after we've had them?  Make them at home?  Can't..I've tried like crazy and pancakes are one of my specialties.  Have other things on the menu?  Hahahahahaha...that's just funny.  However, on my last visit, my friend said, \"Hey, someone told me they now offer a half and half option.\"  You mean I can get mini-protein pancakes and a skillet?  Jumpin' Jesus on a pogostick I'm in!  Warning...if you go...you'll become a regular."}
{"text":"After reading reviews from a range of people including triathletes, we stopped in on our last day in town.  This place lived up to the reviews and we will be back.  Staff was courteous, prompt, and the food was exceptional.  Nice outdoor seating area for awesome spring morning like today...nice way to spend our last morning in town with family."}
{"text":"Had the protein pancakes, sante fe omelet, country fried steaks, and coffee. It was pleasant surprise to have food made from scratch rather than frozen entrees.  The food was light, healthy, fresh, and filling."}
{"text":"Delicious! My wife had the eggs Benedict and I had the Arizona Fritata. My daughter had the half and half and picked the protein pancake and skillet.   Very good!"}
{"text":"Very good home town feel to it.  When you walk into this restaurant 1st thing you see is smiling faces from the waiters and waitresses. I instantly felt like I was going to be taking care of. Unfortunately they don't do military discount but the place is clean, the food looks good and it's a great location. Awesome for family outings"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday morning. Very busy. Waited 25min.  But other than that,  food came quick and was hot and tasty. Service was excellent and friendly even though they were slammed. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast fan so it's pretty remarkable that I love US Egg as much as I do! It's one of my favorite places to dine when in the Phoenix metro area. Don't let its location in a nondescript strip mall deter you from one of the best breakfasts in the country.  US Egg has a laid back, friendly vibe with uncomfortable wood seating and minimal decor. The employees are always cheerful and on the ball, and the kitchen is fast and efficient. This is the perfect place for a quick meal.   The menu is extensive and while it leans heavily towards breakfast items (think pancakes, bacon, and egg skillets), there are some decent lunch / brunch dishes too, including cheeseburgers, club sandwiches, chili, and fries. There's something for everyone, down to a low cal side of cottage cheese to lots of gluten free options.     My favorite item are also what made the place famous: their protein pancakes. I tell myself they're also low carb (they aren't), but man are these tasty! Loaded with blueberries, homemade granola and a hint of cinnamon, try 'em once and you will be hooked. Don't bother with the full order, you won't be able to finish them! These pancakes are HUGE and absolutely delicious, and don't forget to ask for extra butter as well as the sugar free syrup.   The bacon is always cooked nice and crispy too, which for me is a real benchmark of a competent kitchen. I don't eat eggs or breakfast potatoes, but my hubby says they're legit.   If you order water or iced tea, you get a glass and a huge pitcher left on your table! (Not with the sodas, unfortunately). Refills are free, but I love how it ensures that I'll never run out of my drink! The biggest negative of this place is that while they do have coffee, they don't serve espresso-based drinks like cappuccino or lattes. This means you're forced to sip watered-down American coffee. Minus a star for that because it's a huge negative; a serious breakfast cafe ought to have serious coffee beverages.  Pro tip: come here to eat at non-typical breakfast times (think 11:30 am on a weekday) and you'll have zero wait and the restaurant practically to yourself. Come on a Sunday morning, however, and get ready to sit an hour (or more) for a table to open up."}
{"text":"For as much as this place is talked about, I thought it would be better. The food was good but I don't think it's better then the Good Egg. They're a lil pricey. The inside is very cluttered, the tables are on top of each other u can listen clearly to other convos little annoying. But the food was good though so I guess u have to weigh that."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived at around 9am on a Saturday for breakfast.  This was my first visit, and his second.  We were sat right away, and the restaurant had a very clean appearance.  I looked through the menu, and noticed the prices were higher than most breakfast places, this was before seeing their large portions.  I ordered the traditional egg breakfast: 2 eggs (over medium), bacon crispy, hash browns, and an english muffin.  My husband ordered the meat breakfast skillet.  Food came out quickly, and it looked great.  The bacon was cooked well, the eggs were cooked very over easy though.  The whites and the yolks were not cooked up to a safe level in my opinion.  I would recommend telling them to make sure that the whites are at least cooked through.  My husband's skillet was huge!!!  2 people could have split it with leftovers!  He ate about 1/3 of it before giving up.    Overall it was a nice experience.  Refills came quick, the service was great, and the prices were good, considering the large portions.  The only things keeping my from rating this restaurant a \"5\" is the eggs being undercooked."}
{"text":"Denise=5Star Service!! Food was tasty and portions generous,coffee and h2o even come with carafes for self-service refills (nice touch),however the real star of the show was my server Denise.Perfect steps of service and so genuinely friendly i can't say enough about her demeanor and skilled service. Thanks to Jeremy (manager) too...gotta feeling he's got more than just a little to do with the great service & atmosphere at this location."}
{"text":"Excellent and convenient we ordered online and could watch the drive time and delivery updates. becauae i forgot hotel room number they called me and asked. I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Good food,  good atmosphere,  large portions.  Staff was courteous and fun.  Christina had a fun sense of humor.  We were a party of 8 and she split our checks for us.  One in our group needed Gluten free and they were accommodating.    We enjoyed our breakfast.  Would deffinately recommend!"}
{"text":"Great alternatives...they have a low carb menu and some \"just protein\" combinations. I had a white burger, with no buns. the only bad point, I asked it medium well and it came a bit red for my taste. Aside from that...all what my CS friends ordered looked good and had good taste. Good attention in general and a nice environment."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went to US Egg on a Friday morning thinking we'd avoid the weekend crowd. We were able to get a table right away but it was pretty packed. Almost every table was sat so I can see how this place would have a long wait on weekends.  Even though we were sat right away it did take a while for anyone to come over to our table. By the time they did we were both ready to order.  I ordered the half and half - two small protein cakes and a half skillet. Boyfriend got blueberry pancakes, eggs and bacon.  Just like the time we spent waiting at the beginning, our food took quite a long time. At one point our waitress walked by and said that our food was coming right out but I swear it was still 10 minutes from that point. Our plates must have been sitting a while because while our pancakes were warm our eggs were cold.   I will say the protein pancakes were very good - the highlight of the meal for sure. The skillet was pretty good - hashbrowns, chicken, avocado, tomatoes and the egg on top. I liked it but the pancakes were filling so I mostly ate those since I liked them better.  Boyfriend said his pancakes and bacon were just okay, nothing special and like I said earlier, his eggs were cold.  I don't see us waiting on a weekend for this place but if you do, go for the protein pancakes - they're awesome."}
{"text":"This is probably the most completely disappointing breakfast I've had in years. Came in with the expectation that I would have a nice stack of pancakes and a typical American breakfast. Yes I intended to over indulge and completely fall off the diet wagon. And possibly burn it for the day. My waitress was attentive, but that's about all I can say for her. When I asked about the corned beef hash and whether or not it was fresh or canned, her answer was that it was fresh. This was a pleasant surprise given that 95% of restaurants serve canned corn beef hash. So, taking a chance I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs with a stack of pancakes. When she asked me if I wanted the \"protein\" pancakes I answered no, just the basic unhealthy buttermilk pancakes please. Sadly, this restaurant only serves whole-wheat pancakes. If you're looking for tender, light, tasty pancakes, do not come here. Their whole wheat pancakes have the consistency of shipping twine, and the flavor of butchers paper. The best thing I can say about the (canned) corned beef hash is that it wasn't burned. The scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and English muffin were average. For a total of $18+ (I wasn't charged for the pancakes as I sent them back, and she didn't charge me for the milk as a \"sorry for the inconvenience\"), this was a complete disappointment. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Can't get much better. The food was great and the service was fast and friendly. We had the half skillet and basic breakfast. Everything was delicious. The owner, Mario, came by ask us if everything was fine. I think this is one of the best breakfast places in Phoenix and we have tried a bunch of them."}
{"text":"We visited the family in Phoenix for Thanksgiving and before heading back home to LA, we had breakfast at US Egg.  There were 14 of us, so not an easy fit during a holiday weekend.  We went a little early to hopefully beat the breakfast rush.  After a 10 minute wait, our table was ready.  Service was quick and efficient.  Given that we had so many people, the waitress had to make a lot of different trips, but never indicated she was annoyed by it.  She also thought ahead and left a couple of coffee carafes and pitchers of water at the table.  She was also attentive making sure cream for the coffee was refilled.  I used the excuse that since I was on a holiday, I could splurge on my meal by getting the chicken fried steak and eggs breakfast.  The fried steak was spot on!  The gravy was not overly thick and flavorful.  The crispiness of the fried steak remained and the amount meat was not lacking.  I got my eggs sunny side up, so that was an easy one.  Requested extra crispy hash browns and again they delivered.  All around a good meal and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  I will definitely be returning to this US Egg location!"}
{"text":"Very good place place to eat! All staff are always friendly! Rachel the waitress is my all time favorite! Also Emily is another great waitress! In all honesty they are all great! Even management!"}
{"text":"Exactly how a restaurant should be run: spotless, pleasantly decorated, consistently well trained staff, consistent food quality. Breakfast is insanely fast out of the kitchen.  If you come more than a few times the owner Mario will know your name.  For breakfast you can't go wrong here.  Good job Mario!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was outstanding, prices were good and portions were huge. Coffee was tasty, their protein pancakes are THE BOMB, their skillets were super yummy (and huge, 1 regular one could have been split between the two of us!). Overall awesome place and we will be going back. I think we found our new breakfast spot :)"}
{"text":"Protein pancakes are definitely a must try. I liked their half and half plate a lot - I liked that I could try a little of everything and having the savory and sweet dishes side by side was a nice way to mix up the palate."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat breakfast.  It is a bit pricey, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Crispy hash browns and hot coffee. They even give you the water and coffee pot at your table so you don't have to worry about them coming to fill your cup. Being a person who drinks a lot of water, that is very helpful."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service, and bomb music!  Felicia was our server. She was sweet, fast and listened to what we wanted and delivered prompt service. Plus she was attentive. Got us drinks before we could ask.  The food was really good too. Felicia advised us to try the half and half (\"the protein pancakes are great!\") And it was a good choice! My wife got the Santa Fe and I got the meat lovers. Both great but the Santa Fe was CHOICE!  80's and 90's rock/pop playing... Loved it!"}
{"text":"I've been to another location of U.S. Egg but it was a few years ago. I met some friends here for breakfast on a Sunday and it was lovely. Our servers were friendly and attentive and the vibe of the place was positive and welcoming.   Our food came out quickly and I ordered the triple play, which comes with two eggs, two whole wheat pancakes (I added chocolate chips) and I choose hash browns instead of meat. The eggs and potatoes were fine, nothing spectacular but they're pretty easy to make. The pancakes though...so so good. I only ate one and took the other home. I had it for breakfast the next morning and it was tasty, I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted better reheated.   Good food, fair prices, and quality service: no wonder this is a popular breakfast place."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant! Out waitress was not friendly and didn't check on us. All the staff looks miserable. You expect more from a new restaurant. Food comes and it's cold. The potatoes weren't cooked, sent the food back they offered to remake it but choose not to eat. Tasted terrible anyways... Asked for more coffee and the waitress threw it on the table. That's when I had enough and went and got the manager. I'm sitting here in the restaurant writing this because it was that bad! We should have walked out when we walked in because we heard one of the employees apologizing to someone on the phone."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Cute and small with amazing food. I was here a few days ago and found the prices reasonable, the atmosphere homey and the food amazing!"}
{"text":"We loved it. Lots of healthy options, hearty portions of fruit, and all around deliciousness."}
{"text":"Greeted warmly and enthusiastically. Waited on quickly. Protein pancakes were as sensational as usual. Perfect poached eggs. Tuna melt was good and fries were done as requested, crispy and hot but not overdone."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! We've been here a few times for breakfast and really enjoyed it. The wait is never very long and the food is really yummy, especially the protein pancakes! The staff is always very friendly and I love that they ask us if we want a to-go drink before we leave. You can tell they really care about their customers here. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fast, efficient, and friendly requested a booth was accommodated and me and my wife had a very yummy and filling breakfast both locations are excellent Tempe location is in a awesome area"}
{"text":"Although U.S. Egg is less than a mile from my house I have never eaten there: good riddance!  I called to place an order for pickup and an employee answered the phone. The first word out of her mouth was \"What?\" and she promptly hung up on me. I understand people make mistakes, but that is NOT the proper way to handle a botched phone call. I should have taken this as a sign, but I decided to call back and place my order. I should have trusted my instinct.   When I walked in I was hardly greeted by the server. She left to check on my order, and another couple for pickup walked in the door. The couple almost took my order that was now sitting on their podium. I was waiting with cash in hand to pay for my food, which at this point had been sitting in front of me for a few minutes; however, the server took the credit card of the customer that walked in after me and disappeared. The manager stood in front of the podium ignoring me. I was very temped to leave the money on the counter so I could take my food and leave. Finally, I was allowed to pay. I let the employee keep the $0.09 cents extra.  As I pulled out of my parking space, the manager (who seemed too distracted to take my money) walked out the door and stopped me to ask \"did you order oatmeal?\" They apparently don't record orders well, nor do they keep track of names for phone orders.  The food was average, at best. My friend said his Reuben was \"okay,\" and my chicken Philly was bland and dry.    I am glad I have never stopped in before, and I will not be returning. That kind of \"customer service\" is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The service here is phenomenal. The portion sizes are great, I have never had a bad experience at the Egg and we are regular customers. Anytime we try a new place my son will give his \"review\" usually followed by \"but it's not the Egg!\" If you haven't been here- you're missing out!"}
{"text":"I honestly never expected much out of U.S. Egg, assuming it'd be just another clone of the various Good (Mediocre) Egg locations you see scattered about Phoenix. And while I can't speak for any of the other U.S. locations, I can at least vouch for this one.  The main reason I rate this place highly is for its consistency and efficiency. Servers always seem be on top of things and we've yet to have a bad meal here. While their eggs, hash browns, and bacon are all acceptable, we've found that their signature protein pancakes are what's most appreciated. They include a mixture of blueberries, granola, cinnamon, and slivered almonds and can be optionally upgraded or tacked onto any meal that you're having. There's a reason why everyone recommends them. We did have one sole incident where our pancakes were visibly burnt, so we had to flag down the server and request some replacements. That's the only time we've ever had an issue. Fortunately, the problem was fixed without questions or hassle.  They remain open till 2:30pm, whereas most breakfast joints close a half hour earlier. The extra 30 minutes comes in handy more often than one would assume.  Although Mike and Ronda's \"The Place\" a little further up the road has traditionally remained the default choice if you're having a massive 25-relative weekend breakfast family gathering. I've found that I like the food (and the calmer environment) of U.S. Egg much better."}
{"text":"This place is like IHOP's hot sister. Similar booths and casual feel with the larger than life, have-breakfast-anyway-you-can-imagine-it menu. The key differences include Mimosas/Bloody Marys, fresh squeezed juices, delicious blueberry protein pancakes, and generally better food. Is it on par with some of the modern brunch places in town that offer innovative menu options? No. But it's pretty damn good if your looking for a more traditional, no fuss, breakfast spot. For what it is, it's a 4 out of 5 for me, personally. I prefer First Watch which offers traditional breakfast fare along with inspired dishes on a more focused, organic/farm-to-table, menu."}
{"text":"I had the Cornhusker with pumpkin pancakes and oatmeal instead of potatoes. My son had the Triple Play. The meal was okay, nothing special but good. Wheat pancakes are what they serve but there are protein and waffles for an additional fee or sometimes am equal exchange for seasonal pancakes (pumpkin in this situation). Oatmeal was good.  Server with light brown sugar, milk/cream and raisins.  I would prefer dark brown sugar but that's just me. Server was polite and efficient, checking on us frquently and prompt to clean up empty plates.  Overall, it was a pretty good dining experience."}
{"text":"Found this little breakfast gem a few weeks back and ate in the Tempe location.  Service was so friendly and the manager came over to tell us about how they locally source many of their food items and have fresh squeezed juice.   Was delicious.    Today we opted for the chandler location.  We arrived and many tables were wide open but the seating hostess decided to trot us all the way to the very back.   One of my pet peeves!  So we asked to be moved closer to the middle and we received attitude.  So here's the deal I will come back again but please treat your guests with respect.  Had they been packed with no tables left then fine.  But there was no reason to take us all the way to the back."}
{"text":"So here we go, completely unbiased  (my girlfriends a manager at this location).  What's for breakfast? Pancakes? Eggs? Sandwiches? Burgers? Christ do you want a steak?! They got it. This place has a very bubbly atmosphere since all the servers are younger girls. This location in particular gets very busy, so be careful with what time you decide to adventure out to the United States of egg. The food may seem pricey, especially when the food isn't absolutely amazing (organic, open range, grass fed blah blah) but the portion sizes are unreal. Good look getting home after you slip into that food coma you breakfast goers:)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything is good and the portion size is generous and filling! The pancakes are the perfect consistency. The skillets are good too. You can't go wrong! Service is always excellent!"}
{"text":"First impression for me wasn't to pleasant i had to use the restroom when i got done i saw an employee walk out of a bathroom stall and not wash his hands. So i went to the host to contact the manager and addressed my issue that i did not want the employee handling me n my families food. Shortly after the issue was resolved by the manager and the emoyee was spoken to about hygiene, the employee came to my table and apologized for what I'd seen and explained he did not use the restroom but only got tissue out the stall.\"hmmm\". I said ok np. Still i made sure he didn't handle my food. Manager was promped on my complaint. I didn't wanna get anyone into trouble but when it comes to my food im big on my own son touching it or anyone else. Other than that customer service is great, seems to be a very busy establishment, host is very curtious. Prices are fair, food is good. Imma give it 3 stars for now til next time only cuz of the first impression i got on the bathroom issue. Other than that thank you to the manager for addressing my concern..."}
{"text":"I had not gone out for breakfast in a long time it seemed... So I knew this spot had just opened and wanted check it out. I arrived to a really busy restaurant and was seated pretty fast... I was greeted by my server Sam with a smile plus she was really helpful with giving me tips on what to order. I ended up going with the Meat Lovers Skillet half and half that means half skillet and two Protein Pancakes. I rate the experience as followed...  Meat Lovers Skillet - B Protein Pancakes - B    Service - A++  I would say this is a great place to eat... I will be back for sure I saw other things I want to try off the menu."}
{"text":"My Daughter and I came here (from out of town) after hiking Thunderbird Mountain. I found it on my App that they had Gluten Free Waffles. We were so excited only to find out the Waffles were not on the menu. We ordered Eggs and Bacon and Hashbrowns and GLUTEN FREE Toast that was to die for. Everything was cooked PERFECTLY and the Coffee and Mimosas were delicious too! The Manager approached us and asked how everything was and we told him excellent but we were a little disappointed because we were looking forward to a Gluten Free Waffle. He apologized and said it hadn't made it to the menu yet. Then he said, \"I'm going to go make you one right now!\" I told him we were full and he said, \"Then, I'll make you 1/2 a Waffle!\" :) Oh my gosh it was huge like a Belgium Waffle served with Real Butter and Delicious Syrup! We were stuffed but definitely satisfied! Thank you U.S. Egg!"}
{"text":"The location is convenient, but the food wasn't outstanding. The décor was very depressing ... maybe I would come back if the vibes weren't so sad. Our waitress wasn't very attentive either, but the hostess up front was very kind."}
{"text":"I went into US Egg the other morning with my friend - I'm a new resident of Arizona and love breakfast food. Ordered a breakfast burrito and found a huge black hair inside of it right after my second bite. Told the manager about it, they offered to make me a new plate... when they came back I had half of the wrong order, this time, hold the hair. I figured maybe after all the bs they'd comp my food as I was extremely nice and easy going about it all. They definitely didn't comp my food and had me pay. Out of all the restaurants in Phoenix Tempe and Scottsdale, I won't be going back here."}
{"text":"This is your average breakfast place. It is great for a meeting or a quick bite and has all the usual fare. Easy to get in and out fast."}
{"text":"The best for breakfast. Always clean, super friendly, great service, and the food is always excellent!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out here for me and my boyfriend on a sunday morning. Had to run some errands before i was going to go get it and so I asked the lady if i could have it ready in 30 min. And they actually did that! I got there 35 minutes later and they were just finishing boxing it up. We got the biscuits and gravy YUM! and my boyfriend got the triple play. The pancakes were okay he said but the bacon was super delish. Overall just a great breakfast and we will for sure eat/ get take out from here again"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and we wanted to find a good breakfast place. We hit the jackpot!!  Great menu, decor, service, and food. Ashley our server, was courteous, polite and helpful with advice about the many wonderful food dishes.  A must \"go to\" place if you want a great breakfast!!"}
{"text":"We went around 8:30 on a Saturday and the following Wednesday same time. We were seated immediately. We had attentive and pleasant service. Our order came out in short order and was prepared as we had ordered it. It was a great experience both times and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Vonny was our server for breakfast this morning (3/27/16). If I had a restaurant full of Vonny's, my restaurant would always be full of happy customers!  I was looking for something that wasn't exactly on the menu and she made it happen. The food was excellent, fresh, and yummy. I had a skillet with sautéed spinach, mushrooms,  bacon and onions over crispy hash browns topped with jack cheese and then two over easy eggs. She also brought a side of hollandaise thinking that would be a nice add on. Delicious! My husband ordered a half and half that consisted of your choice of half a skillet and half order of protein pancakes with wild Maine blueberries.  Other reviews also comment on how good the protein pancakes are and they are not to be missed!!  Make sure to get a side order for the table for everyone to share. There's texture from the granola and slivered almonds, great flavor from the cinnamon and blueberries and the pancake itself was light and fluffy.   If there's a wait, it will be worth it and ask for Vonny's section!"}
{"text":"Wonderful waitress named Parker.  Great food, and nice atmosphere.   If you haven't been, check it out.  Order it the way you want it, and they deliver.  This was my first time here, and it won't be my last, at least at this location.  Parker, you are great.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a couple of weeks ago. Order some strawberry pancakes and bacon and an omelette that literally was built on what we wanted to have in it. The bacon was delicious! Best bacon I have ever had! The pancake was good and giant! The strawberries were too sweet! I'm not sure if they are canned with syrup instead of fresh strawberries but I had to moved them to the side. The omelette was good and the hash browns too! To be the first time here I kind say that it was okay. Cool thing- waiters are wearing pj's! P.S. our waiter was really nice and checked on us often."}
{"text":"We love going to U.S. Egg! We have only been in Phoenix for a month and have eaten here 4 times? The protein pancakes are to die for, I would eat here everyday for breakfast if I could afford it!!"}
{"text":"I truly did enjoy the food, had a great selection the service was amazing."}
{"text":"Our first time here. My husband had the meat lovers which had the best country fried steak in it he said. I had the Arizona frittata which had the freshest veggies . Overall great experience. Great service and great food. Will definitely come again. Our new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"We have been hitting this place up quite a bit after our Sunday Church sessions. Honestly, if there was a cheaper alternative closer, we would probably go there, I don't have any complaints about the service or the food, but the pricing for what you get does not stack up. It's about $9 average per place, I am always really full and hardly ever finish my plate but it really hits the pocket after two plates, and two coffees. So I'd say until the prices drop a little, this place is just average."}
{"text":"If you like to eat healthy, this is the place! I was in town for a few days, and a good breakfast every morning was vital to my survival. I was very happy wit U.S. Egg. I liked that they had healthy and gluten free options. As for me, I had three scrambled eggs and the fruit plate every morning. The fruit was real, hand cut, and well selected (proper ripeness). The coffee was good also, and they leave you a hot carafe at the table. All the servers I had were polite, attentive, and good nature-ed. The manager was super friendly also, and he seemed like a cool guy. Overall, I had a great eggsperience here!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I'm definitely not impressed. The service was very slow especially for the restaurant being pretty empty. We were unfortunately seated fairly close to the kitchen and heard just about everything; how exhausted they were, how lucky someone was because they were getting off, where they live, if they can borrow someone's vape.   I'm all for talking with co workers and such however we were in hurry and waiting to order so waiting for you to finish socializing is really not something we wish to see.   The food was mediocre, really the only reason for any stars. Not quite sure if we will be back any time soon..."}
{"text":"For a place that calls itself the US Egg, they really don't know how to cook an egg. Three of us ordered over easy eggs and all three orders were served with over cooked yolks. That was depressing. I go to an establishment with the word \"egg\" in its name it's only natural to expect to be served exceptional eggs. I myself ordered the huevos rancheros and let me say, they really need to remove anything Mexican from the menu. I felt like I had the biggest slap in the face as soon as I started eating my meal. Aside from the egg yolks being overcooked, they were served on my tortilla. How am I supposed to eat my eggs if my tortilla is underneath all of my food? As for the salsa, it tasted like something you buy in a jar at the supermarket and dip your chips into. And why would you put canned chili beans in my huevos rancheros? Beans don't belong in my eggs let alone chili beans. Oh and the \"sour cream\" that was served with my meal, it was the size of pea. I should have known not to order this dish as soon as the waitress asked me how I wanted my eggs. Huevos rancheros only come with over easy eggs. But hey, at least we were able to have mimosas to help us forget how depressing our breakfast was."}
{"text":"I meet my friend for weekday brunches here. As soon as I walk in we are seated right away by the host. Now carrying a baby carrier on my hand the host right away suggested a larger table and as soon as we were seated they brought out a sling to place the baby carrier in. I loved the fact that they had the initiative to do it I didn't have to ask them.   As far as service goes the staff is mostly young college age women who are very polite and prompt. I asked for my eggs cooked a certain way and they never mess up. My friend was on Whole 30 eating plan and they accommodated and adjusted her order.   The taste is good I've had a few different breakfast variations and everything was tasty never bland. I will have to try linch next time. Their pancakes are very unique as they have oatmeal or home made granola in them. They also have whole wheat pancakes and other options.   You will pay more than the typical franchise breakfast/diner but this place is worth it. Good service and clean, as well As good food."}
{"text":"I live right across the street from US Egg and gave it a try after hearing my roommate rant over their food and service. This place has become by far my favorite breakfast joint!   The service is always great! Everyone there is friendly and good at their jobs. They get things done quickly, efficiently  and make you feel at home. They are always willing to substitute for most things except for the eggs. They always leave me a full pitcher of water for convenience. The food is my favorite in Phoenix! I have had a lot of meals and all have been great! My favorite is probably the chicken and waffles. The gravy that comes with the chicken is the best sausage gravy you can get. The chicken is in strips but is super high quality. The chicken fried steak is delicious as well as the pancakes, sausage, bacon, French toast, waffles, eggs of course, and they have a wide variety of food.  Easy 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Great service, pretty servers, clean establishment, and good food. Check it out if you haven't been there."}
{"text":"I went here once about a year ago, I was in the area today, so thought I would stop in again for a bite.  It was a great breakfast. I had a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice with a cornhusker plate.   The fried eggs were properly cooked. The hash browns were good. The bacon was tasty.  The English muffin was very good, perfectly toasted and spread with butter. Most breakfast restaurants don't toast their bread and muffins long enough, but this one was spot on. Crispy but not burnt.  And the wheat pancakes were excellent. I was a little apprehensive about ordering them. Although I like wheat bread, wheat pancakes didn't sound like my favorite.  I asked the waitress if they had regular buttermilk, she said no, but to let her know if I didn't like them. I ended up liking them a lot. They were good sized and thin, not thick and cake like. The included syrup was a nice compliment.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. The service was prompt and friendly. I think the next time I want to try an omelette. And I saw another waitress carrying what looked to be some type of scrambled egg skillet that looked appetizing too."}
{"text":"Love this place for a lazy Sunday. Great creative menu items and friendly staff. Usually order the half skillet and half stack of protein pancakes. But their benediction is excellent too"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!  The Half and Half was amazing and my girlfriend loved the Maine Blueberry Waffle."}
{"text":"I got the \"half and half,\" a small portion of the Idaho skillet and protein pancakes. I strayed from the menu when it came to topping choice with the Idaho skillet, so I got a lovely hot mess of hashborns, onoins, cheese, country fried steak and gravy with an over easy eggs on top. The protein pancakes were amazing. Whole wheat pancakes with almond granola, blueberry and cinnamon, which would be perfect with bananas on top."}
{"text":"Dad, the sis, and I came here for breakfast/brunch after climbing \"A\" Mountain this weekend. I'm sorry to say I've lived here for 2 years and never made it here until now. I will definitely be back. Ordered the half and half because it allowed me to not have to make a decision. I loved the protein pancakes! They were awesome and I will definitely be getting them again. The potato skillet was good, I ordered the santa fe, but not the best I'd ever had. The sis ordered french toast and she thought they were great. It was a little cramped as we were seated by a group of six at a table that normally seated 4, but not a problem. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday for the first time since moving to Arizona since I had heard such good things.  My friend and I were immediately seated and browsed the expansive menu which consisted of both breakfast and lunch options.  Since we were both out partying the night before, we opted for breakfast even though it was 12:30 in the afternoon.  I ordered the classic eggs benedict while my friend ordered the apple pancake platter.  Our server was really, really good at what she did.  We never had to ask for anything, she was super sweet, and very knowledgeable of the menu and substitution options.   When our food arrived, it was simple in presentation.  Nothing to \"wow\" you but here's where they blew me away.  I haven't had a true poached egg in years (most places destroy poached eggs since they're not easy to cook).  Mine were perfect.  Imagine my surprise as I cut into the egg and the yolk just oozed over the egg white and down the side of the English Muffin.  Pure poached egg bliss!  My compliments to the chef.  He really knows what he's doing.   My meal was delicious and the hash browns were exactly as ordered (extra crispy). My friend raved about her meal as well.  She loved the pancakes and her bacon looked like something out of a food magazine.  Oh, and the coffee?  Delicious!  Strong and smooth.  Order a cup.  It's magical. The food coupled with the service makes this a must go place for breakfast.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow... how hard is it to make an over easy egg?  3 plates that had over easy eggs and all 3 were over cooked.  Also, please take off huevos rancheros off the menu.  The fact that CHILI was thrown on the plate is a disgrace to Mexican cuisine and you should no longer be allowed to make it. Btw... the tortilla should be on the side, not under the concoction you call huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"Have been to this location and never had a problem before with service. This morning i take a seat at the counter. Although it was busy there were plenty of waitresses, some of whom were just standing around in the area behind the counter. Was totally ignored for well over 5 minutes when one of the bus boys approached me and asked me if i had been helped yet. I told him \"no\". He said he would get a waitress to come right over. A short time later a waitress starts to walk over towards me but stops and takes an order from a guy at the counter a few seats over who came in after me. No big deal. I figure she's gonna come over and take my order after she is finished with him. Instead, she finishes taking his order and then walks away and doesn't come back. I finally get up and start to leave when the bus boy runs up to me apologizing and says he is going to talk to the manager. The manager then followed me out the door asking me to let him make it right. Told him it's too late for that. Just treat your customers right from the start and then there won't be a problem. The main reason i go there is because it is convenient and the service is usually good; which makes up for the high prices and the terrible coffee, which is very bitter and acidic. With bad service, no point in eating there. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast at fair prices. The waitresses are always sweet and attentive. One of our families go to places for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast place.  The food is always good and comes out quickly no matter how busy the restaurant is.  The waitresses are always friendly.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here on a Saturday morning.  There's a wait, and there's a reason for it.  They have a wide selection of breakfast items, and they do a good job with it, whether it's a basic egg dish, pancakes, French toast, etc.  They leave a pot of coffee on the table (I always like that), and service, once seated, is prompt and friendly.  It has the feel of an old school breakfast place, and a menu that fits, plus some.  I wouldn't look here for super upscale gourmet breakfast food, but I would definitely come back for good ol' breakfast.  So many choices yet to try!"}
{"text":"Don't know where my U.S. Egg reviews went, but I really do love the protein pancakes here.  It's a small place, so give yourself a lot of time on the weekends-- arrive before 10a or wait till after 11:30a.  Breakfast ends at 2p.  Mom loves their skillets!  Pass on their biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and the food was amazing. I got the pumpkin pancakes and they were delicious, there are 2 sizes you can order the crazy huge size or a 3 attack of normal sized pancakes which is what I went for. Both times I have been here I was meeting some friends for brunch. They were extremely happy with what they ordered both times also. Will definitely be back oh and they do have alcoholic beverages I got the greyhound, tasty and a good deal. I recommend this place for a yummy brunch stop."}
{"text":"I'm very big on breakfast and picky as hell BUT This is by far the best place I've never been to for breakfast! They took care of all my needs & the customer service was out of this world! George the Manger/Co-Owner is the most welcoming and friendly guy I've come into contact with in a while. He greets every person who walks through the door with a smile and is willing to get his guests whatever they need to enjoy their meal. The energy and feeling of all the employees was genuine and hospitable and I will most definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now and I plan on going back again and again. Contrary to prior reviews I have always received excellent service! The young ladies that wait tables here are beautiful as well as extremely sweet and attentive. I always feel like I'm an old family friend when I come here.  I've had the opportunity to try quite a few dishes here. The breakfast sandwich with a side of fruit is delicious! It is a generous amount of fresh food for under $10! (the fruit isn't even cut until I order it)  I've also had the traditional breakfast with eggs, hashbrowns and bacon. When I first read the reviews about the hashbrowns not being crispy I was shocked, maybe a simple remedy for the other customers could be to simply ask for \"crispy hashbrowns\" as I did and they would be more than happy with their outcome. I've also enjoyed the ever popular half and half. This is a small (but still generous) stack of their famous protein pancakes (blueberry, granola, cinnamon and almonds) and a half skillet of your choice. I chose the ham, sausage and mushroom skillet, the ham is diced and thick, the sausage juicy and the mushrooms lightly sauteed with a layer of hashbrowns at the bottom. I like to switch it up with the half and half and get strawberry pancakes from time to time at no charge!  I honestly don't understand why this place doesn't have five stars! I'm baffled. The managers are also so attentive, I've seen them checking on every table in the place, which gives you ample opportunity to speak up if your food ie: hashbrowns or eggs are not to your liking. I'm sure they'd be more than happy to improve your experience. Seriously people speak up and stop being so picky!"}
{"text":"The half-and-half was great it comes with smaller protein pancakes and I got the half Santa Fe omelet.  This is the old Good Egg that got moved to Happy Valley and 39ave which is also a great place for breakfast.  I love how they gutted this place since it was old and outdated and now it nice and new.  I do wish they used more comfortable booths....its like sitting on a park bench.  The food and service is great and I highly recommend the half and half!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places that I have ever been to. They have amazing food and outstanding servers. We are always greeted with a smile and great respect, which is wonderful and brings us back time after time.  It is a family owned place and you can see the pride they have in their place.  Two thumbs up for USEgg!"}
{"text":"Solid food. A little pricey but service was great. I had the breakfast sandwich no hash browns sub fries. It was really good the fries were amazing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome expensive but the food is great and the service is awesome as well as the quaint small complex. It is hard to find parking sometimes but it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and will keep coming back.  Great service and great food.  Breakfast and lunch options as well as heathy and hearty options.  Can't go wrong with the Protein Pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  $15.99 for a lousy waffle, scrambled eggs with 4 strips of bacon.  You can go to Matts Big Breakfast or even the Place and spend less and receive larger portions.  I threw away my $10.00 weekday coupon.  What a joke."}
{"text":"I love eating at the U.S. Egg in Tempe, was in the Chandler area, and wanted to start off the new year right by eating at a good breakfast spot! A lot of other people had the same idea as we did and when we arrived around 11:30 there was about a 15 minute wait which wasn't too bad since there are several benches people can use to sit and chill. It also gave us time to browse through the menu and pick out our food.  I got my old standby, the half and half: 2 normal sized protein pancakes (Versus the flying saucer sized ones that come with a full order) and a skillet of your choice. My favorite skillet is the chicken bacon because of the mixture of ingredients and flavors. It was served with one egg (Ordered poached today). It was made very quickly, especially considering the high volume of customers in the restaurant today, and tasted great. The protein pancakes were slightly crispy with a hearty mixture of batter, oats, a touch of cinnamon, and blueberries. A full mound of butter and some thick maple syrup were the accompaniments. The skillet was equally as pleasing, with a filling amount of chicken, bacon, potatoes, and melted cheese. The only slight negative was that there was a very slim amount of paste-like avocado mixture on the skillet. In other versions I've had they normally give you a few slices of avocado.  Service was decent considering there were so many people eating here today, and I appreciated that the server left us a whole pitcher of iced tea and a whole carafe of coffee so we could serve our own refills.   The actual atmosphere of the restaurant is similar to the Tempe location, except the Chandler restaurant seems to be able to seat more people.  Overall a good place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went here again recently, and the patio is very nice if you want to bring your dog with you.  The waitress even got a whole pitcher of ice free water just for our dog's water bowl.  They are offering their seasonal pumpkin pancakes now, which I ordered.  They were delicious, but I'm still a bigger fan of their protein pancakes!"}
{"text":"US Egg keeps it simple and delicious! My husband and I wanted just an easy, low-fuss breakfast. US egg doesn't disappoint! Consistently a Delicious, speedy serviced meal. I chose the steak and eggs (poached) while my husband opted for the chicken and waffles. Both AMAZING. Nothing super fancy or unique but we ate every single bite.  Our server was a sweetheart who made friendly small talk and checked in with us throughout breakfast.  The chicken and waffles is more of a chicken tender meal with waffles but again it's a no hassle meal. The portions are average and that's okay too."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast, great and wonderful service. Food just ok nothing spectacular had a veggie omelette not very flavorful blah. My son had star and spangled waffles just ok. Pretty pricey for the food."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast! Great staff and huge portions served. Better than Dennys or Ihop for sure!"}
{"text":"I think we just had a weird visit but I wasn't impressed. We were sat fairly quickly but it took a while for a server to come by- which is understandable if it's busy but it was noon on a Tuesday and there was only one other table. The food took a long time and everything was way overcooked. Just not a great time."}
{"text":"Went here after hearing about the protein pancakes. So, I had the 'half and half' order which was 'small' (still big in my opinion) protein pancakes and half Santa Fe something all in all it was good tasted great, but I honestly would have expected more for the price.  I am willing to spend money, but for what they charged I would have expected more. If you want a real change and great breakfast/AM eatery try 'SNOOZE' in Phoenix's Town and country shopping centre.  I did enjoy the food. Don't get me wrong, but as I said, \"I would prefer to spend that amount of money else where.\""}
{"text":"US Egg is, without a doubt, my favorite place to get breakfast! Sure, it's pricey. However, the staff is always friendly and their service is top-notch. I've only been here for breakfast (they do have a lunch menu as well) and I have yet to order something that I ended up not liking. Their indoor dining room is pretty large, and they also have some outdoor patio seating as well. The parking lot isn't huge, but it gets the job done.  I generally go with one of their omelets. They come with a large side of hash browns and an English muffin. They also have excellent protein pancakes which almost taste too good to be true.  One word of note... make sure you get there early on the weekends or be prepared to wait for a table. It's definitely a popular place!"}
{"text":"Very yummi. And great service.  They have an outdoor patio. .. perfect to enjoy the cool days."}
{"text":"Good breakfast omelette. Decent service. Not a whole lot of potatoes options but good eggs and they even have turkey sausage which is fairly rare.  Good place worth checking out"}
{"text":"Good price ,but don't order over medium eggs or spinach. The eggs where raw and the water in the spinach wasn't dried out."}
{"text":"Good service, lots of options. I have always been happy with my food here. Really like the veggie hashbrown skillet. The food is a little expensive for what it is; you can probably find comparable food at a cheaper price, but the restaurant is clean and comfortable, so, worth it."}
{"text":"Was truly in the mood for a great breakfast. We didn't have to wait at all. The waitress was very courteous. I was excited they had Chalula. We ordered chicken fried steak skillet, and the chicken bacon avacado tomato skillet, and tea. The only thing I was disappointed about was with the tea we ordered. We only got 1 thing off honey per tea ( very small btw )and there was no real sugar only sweet and low."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, always a good experience. The owners are a family and always very personable and offer great service.  My only gripe (not really a gripe but I wish they had) is country potatoes vs. hash browns. Sometimes I just want country potatoes :)  Overall still a great spot that I highly recommend. The protein waffles/pancakes are great and so are the many choices available for scrambles, omelettes, and eggs benny. That California benny is choice!"}
{"text":"We have been enjoying the fabulous meals at U.S. Egg for more than 20 years and are amongst their biggest fans!  This family owned business is wonderful and it's nice to be remembered when you've frequented a business so much.  We were thrilled when they came to Chandler although frankly we'd have continued to drive to Tempe or Scottsdale had they not come this way.  It's THAT good!  Our service is always awesome and as I said earlier the food is great!"}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love US Egg! It's been many years since I've been to this particular location and it was great to be able to return to the original. It's been more than 25 years since I found this gem and have been thrilled to watch this family business grow with multiple locations and not lose the charm and wonderful food that caused me to return all those years ago."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! The protein waffle was off the hook. It didn't sound that great - with granola and almond slivers mixed into the actual batter - but the waitress convinced me and she was right!"}
{"text":"I just tried U.S. Egg for the first time.  I have the french toast with egg and bacon.  It was fine.  I might go back and try something more imaginative next time.  Not much you can say about what I ordered other than it was fine, typical breakfast fare. The service was quick and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Staff is pleasant as is their food. Hats off to manager that goes out of his way to check up on everyone.  High marks for this place."}
{"text":"Found a new breakfast spot!  The bf tasked me with finding a spot for breakfast on the 4th and I gave U.S. Egg a call, they were open, so we headed on down. The inside looks a lot different (brighter, happier) than the outside complex, and we were seated right away. We perused the menu and I decided on the half and half, mostly because I wanted some pancakes. I had the ham, sausage, and mushroom skillet topped with a scrambled egg. The pancakes were not as I expected when they came out - they appeared to be whole wheat (I obviously didn't pay attention to the menu). BUT.THEY.WERE.SO.GOOD!!! Granola, almonds, blueberries, they were easily the best part and I will return just for the protein pancakes. The skillet was great, don't get me wrong, but I fell in love with the pancakes that morning. The service was good, she forgot to bring out my OJ but she quickly took that off the bill. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I think I found my new breakfast spot! Plenty of good for the price, and great customer service! I've been there twice in a couple weeks already, can't get enough of the bacon skillet! Sorry good egg but its over!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for breakfast. I enjoyed the Eggs Benedict. I only gave it a 4 because I've had better, but it was good enough.  The wait staff was very good and the food came out fast.  I'm sure that was because it was not busy at all."}
{"text":"food was ok not good or great just ok and the service was great but the prices are crazy......just go to waffle house for breakfast it taste better and cost half the amount!  dont waste your time or money!!!"}
{"text":"Fast, Friendly, and Fantastic!  Service here is great, it is probably the most efficient restaurant on the planet. I really have never had better service anywhere.  The food is great, well seasoned and properly prepared. The menu has a nice variety. I have tried a number of different dishes and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"The Benedict is your typical kind and tastes typical. Otherwise, it wasn't really memorable. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't 'in-your-face wow.' I'm willing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here on a late Sat morning just to check the place out.  I rarely eat breakfast out...and when i do I say to myself' I could have made that better at home'. But not here! I had the half and half which is the of the protein pancakes and half a skillet and a mimosa. Wow is all I can say...I dont even like pancakes and the skillet was cheesy deliciously  yummy. Definately worth the money!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and service is fast! Recommend getting the half and half when you are here."}
{"text":"It was good. Loved the decor, menu had something on there for everyone. Wasn't knock your socks off amazing, but good enough that I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to go to-do if you've got a hankering for EGGS! But all in all, they have other variants. It's similar to Denny's but nicer and smaller. Their coffee's great. They have gluten-free menu which was nice!"}
{"text":"I like U.S. Egg for the awesome breakfast food but the service needs a liiiiitle help. I just like to feel welcomed when I spend my hard earned money in restaurants but the food is better than I-Hop's so I will be back but I will not expect the help to be over-whelmingly...well helpful."}
{"text":"I went to US twice, and wanted to wait until my 2nd time to give it a review. We initially went when it first opened it's Greenway location. Since I wasn't happy that time, I chalked it up to opening weekend issues.  Our 2nd try was definitely 100 times better. Super nice service and it was packed..we had about a 10 min wait time on a Sunday morning. Coffee was good and the portions are huge...service was slow, but again, I chalk it up to every single table being occupied. Will definitely go back..the hashbrowns were awesome!"}
{"text":"Quick, friendly and efficient service.  I ordered the French Toast with a side of bacon.  Both were attractive, plentiful and tasty.  Convenient location just off the freeway.  Couple of dollars more expensive than my other breakfast place but it is 3 stars and this one is 4 stars.  There is a difference in what you get.  Only dislike - the seating.  Booths are probably easy to wash off but they are not comfortable."}
{"text":"Yummy food and friendly wait staff. I've never had to wait for a table even during brunch on the weekends. :)"}
{"text":"Good breakfast/brunch spot. They were able to seat us with a party of 6 on a Saturday morning relatively quickly. Prices are reasonable - the protein pancakes are yummy!! Service was good."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is phenomenal! I got the chicken and waffles last time, the chicken was amazing and waffle was beyond fluffy. My friend loved her food too, and service is great. Lovely place for any meal, I only wish they had longer hours."}
{"text":"Wifey and I tried US Egg on a Sunday morning knowing we might have a wait on our hands.  We used their web site which has a graph showing the busy times and managed to hit it just when the wait was about two minutes although most tables were full.  The service was immediate and the food came promptly.  It was a bit noisy but it was full of people and isn't a huge place.  We could have selected their patio which was a lot quieter but elected to sit inside.    Wifey ordered a protein pancake which was a big as a dinner plate with a side of hash browns.  I laughed when her order came because that was at least two meals worth and sure enough we had to take a doggie box home as she managed only about half of her order.  She raved about both the pancake and hash browns.  Her hot chocolate was also a winner although the OJ was not as good as it has been in other restaurants.    I got the bacon skillet (one of several \"Idaho Skillets\").  It is a full meal with bacon, plenty of onions and peppers, hash browns and two eggs on top.  Very tasty.  One of the best skillets I have tried at a dozen restaurants.  Their coffee wasn't the best I have ever tasted but it wasn't bad either.  Personal taste probably.  They do leave a carafe on the table so you don't need to wait for multiple cups - always a nice touch.  We were visited four times during our meal by the manager and three wait staff asking how everything was and removing empty plates promptly.  Could not ask for better attention.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast was pretty yummy and as I was walking out I noticed they have mimosas will def go back!!!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast skillet with chicken fried steak,  ham, sausage, potatoes, gravy... and a bunch of other stuff was amazing. The servers are always very attentive and extremely friendly. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"I come to AZ once a year for Spring Training and this is the second time I come here. The wait time is about 20 minutes but worth it. The wheat pancakes, french toast, biscuits and gravy are all very delicious. All the food is well portioned and satisfying. The staff is friendly and very attentive. One thing that bothered me was my girlfriend was ignored by the gentleman (I think is the manager or owner) when she was going to give her name to be placed on the wait list. He waited until I stepped up and took my name instead. I also wish they had larger glasses because I enjoy a large glass of milk with my pancakes or french toast :) I will definitely be back next year for Sunday breakfast!"}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs benedict and although the actual eggs Benedict was delicious, the hash browns were literally starchy mush. Gross. After complaining they simply apologized but didn't redeem themselves in any way. No discounted meal, no replacement hashies (not that I wanted them after that first run.)"}
{"text":"I ordered eggs Benedict with hash browns on the side. It was presented very nicely and it tasted so delicious. This spot is known to have the best protein pancakes and my parents always orders it whenever we eat here. It is filled with blueberries, oats, cinnamon and I don't know what else they put in it. But it is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Finally taking time to review US EGG on Chandler Blvd east of Kyrene. We had excellent service and love that they have so many gluten free options. My hubby loved the 1/2 skillet pancake option too. Recommended."}
{"text":"The corned beef hash was excellent. A really great place for breakfast. I only wish they had a location on the west side....Goodyear/Avondale area."}
{"text":"Had the service been a little better, I would have definitely given a 5-star rating, however, it wasn't up to par. Our server seemed to get distracted very easily or spent more time in the back than up front catering to her guests. Though, the food and coffee was superb. I had the protein pancakes and YUM! The portion is certainly fulfilling and the coffee pot hit the spot.. Pun intended! Would recommend overall."}
{"text":"U S Eggs became a breakfast tradition for our family after our son, Chris, became a Sun Devil student and football player. We drove from California for every home game for five years (he red-shirted) and we always took him to U S Eggs the morning after the game to catch up and hear his stories. The food was always delicious - my favorite is the Triple Play with a protein waffle (yum) and the guys either ate a breakfast skillet or their own version of the Triple Play. One of the owners, Mike Gebran, was always there to greet us and ask Chris how the game went. Friendly, excellent service and delicious food - what more could you ask for. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Location is a strip mall with some very interesting restaurants nearby! Food was not impressive; equivalent to IHOP.  Location was very busy, but we still got food in a reasonable amount of time. Location was also loud and very family friendly.  Not very impressive but fine for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great service as always!  Although they are always busy, they have fast service, fresh food and a nice atmosphere.  The only downfall is its a bit noisy. Thank you Jennifer #262 for give my girlfriend and I great service today."}
{"text":"Just visiting Phoneix and looking for a breakfast place to eat in the morning.  We trusted yelp reviews and went to Us Egg. Food was amazing very friendly people, I will definitely recommend this place to everybody."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast here.  Even though you get there and they seem swamped they are really efficient at moving tables. We've never waited more than 5-10 minutes for a table even on weekends.  I have only had breakfast there so I can only attest for the breakfast food and so far we have never been disappointed.  The protein pancakes are a must.  Very yummy!"}
{"text":"Breakfast comes out HOT and FAST, I love this place for their traditional breakfast and skillets.  I was disappointed with their steak and eggs and burrito.  But stick with a skillet or traditional sausage & eggs and you will be fine.  Warning: portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Katy Perry ought to do the commercial for this place:  U. S. Egg girls, they're just unstoppable, Daisy dukes and pancakes on top. . .  More about that in a minute.  First, I'll talk about the food.  This is the first restaurant we went to when my family first rolled into Phoenix.  While their famous \"protein pancakes\" weren't my taste, I'm a big fan of their regular pancakes and think that theirs are about some of the best I've had.  Fluffy and tasty, they really hit the spot.  And of course, the eggs.  At many places like IHOP or Denny's, you often get scrambled eggs cooked in this weird-tasting grease that leaves you with a burning sensation on your tongue.  At U.S. Egg, they're just tasty, and cooked in butter--delicious.  If you're looking for an opinion of their protein pancakes, just ask my wife.  She's really impressed by them and has ordered them on both occasions that we have visited.  Okay, on to the customer service.  Another reviewer said below that \"legs sell eggs\", and he's right.  This is where my \"daisy dukes\" comment comes in--the servers are all women, and many wear shorts and brightly colored cosmetics.  Beyond their appearance, they tend to be nothing special, and sometimes aren't even particularly nice.  Getting their attention can be challenging.  Nothing horrendous here, but significant enough to dock a star.  Too bad--this would easily be a five star place if they really focused less on legs and more on helpfulness.  If you are looking for a kick-ass breakfast, and don't mind some chilliness and a little bare skin from your server, U.S. Egg will do you right.  Sometimes there's a bit of a wait to get in--not surprising, and totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is freakin amazing. I wish I could give it 1000 stars, but yelp has limitations so I'll settle for 5. Our server was not only top notch, but also so gorgeous that I could hardly pay attention to the gash darn menu. Tanna made sure that we didn't have to lift a finger, if it was up to me, I'd give her a huge raise. She should probably be the one running the place. Any who, go here. Chase after your dreams & snag the California Benedict."}
{"text":"Quick seating, good food, reasonable prices and good service. We went there 2 days  of our 3 day stay in Tempe. We had waffles, Denver omelette, protein pancakes & a side of Ham in all. Everything was very good!"}
{"text":"I came here with my son on a Saturday morning after we got his car serviced. Hungry and wanting breakfast. So what does my son do? Of course, he Yelped it. I taught him well.   Anyways, I put our name in and we had about a five minute wait. Nothing really stood out at this place. Looks pretty bland but it's breakfast. We got seated and our server Sarah greet us really quickly and we asked for coffee and water. She brings us a jug of coffee and a pitcher of water. Nice.   Trying to figure what to order here. It's called US Egg so I assume egg is their speciality. So I ordered the spinach & mushroom omelette. It can with a huge side of hash browns. The omelette had a very large portion of spinach with fresh mushrooms. It was really good. The hash browns were warm not really that hot but still really good.   My son ordered the Hawkeye omelette which came with hash browns too. After his first bite all I heard was oh my gosh. It was so good. He really loved it. Not sure what was in the Hawkeye but he gobbled it all up.   Our server was Sarah and she was really good. She was really funny and a talker. She filled our water cups, checked on us, and just messing with us. S/O to Sarah. Great service and funny.   So after all our breakfast was really good. Great service and good food. Can't ask for anything else from a breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Up until today, I hadn't been here in years.    Went today at 10:00 am and was quite surprised at how busy the restaurant was.  I was even more surprised at the prices.  There wasn't much on the menu for under $10 - for breakfast.  Even the \"lighter\" options were heavy in price.    I was meeting a group, decided to order coffee because I had already eaten.  I must admit that I was surprised at the price of a 'nothing special' cup of coffee - 2.95 for coffee at a breakfast joint is over priced IMO.  I would much rather have spent that money on a Starbucks - at least I would have gotten some enjoyment out of my coffee!  I've heard that the food is good, it had better be darn good for the prices that they charge.    If you're going out for coffee and a muffin, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast food.   Only three stars because the service here can be pretty slow. Definately great pancakes and a very nice atmosphere when it's not too busy"}
{"text":"We love this place for their protein pancakes! The service is always quick and the order accurate. We've tried other US Egg locations and always come back to this one because it's the best!"}
{"text":"Awesome food love the protein pancakes and great service. definitely a must go for breakfast. Expect to leave full with generous portions. Packed on a Saturday morning but people were being seated quickly so that's good. Five stars easy"}
{"text":"Not as cozy as the Tempe location, but the food, especially the skillets remain delicious.  My favorite is the Santa Fe.  Extra points for the many, many gluten-free options."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast or brunch.  The original Tempe skillet.  Great flavor and very good service."}
{"text":"Awesome every time.  Protein pancakes with sugar free syrup are a staple.  Great specials.  Owner always greets at the door.  Get there early as breakfast on the weekend ia packed!"}
{"text":"Look, I realize reading is fundamental but if you're going to do something as blasphemous as only using whole wheat in your pancakes (and aren't an obviously \"health conscious\" restaurant), you should probably put that in every instance of a menu item with that thing. Well, US Egg does mention their pancakes are wheat in nearly every item except the Jr. Pancakes which is exactly what my partner ordered on his quest to find a decently made pancake in the NW valley. Womp womp. At least the manager graciously removed it from our bill.   However, I ordered the veggie skillet without eggs or cheese and with a tortilla (seemed like the easiest vegan option). It was edible, I can say that much. Full size spinach leaves (read: large piles of squishy greens), diced tomato, a few mushrooms, and a few flecks each of green peppers and onion. The real kicker was the massive pile of undercooked hashbrowns. I struggled to find any crispy bits to provide the bulk of my diy burrito. Nothing was seasoned at all - I don't believe salt nor pepper was to be found on my skillet that day. The manager agreed the hashbrowns were sad and did offer a replacement side of crispy browns but I declined, having already smashed down my burrito of sadness. No recompense was provided for the large portion of my dish being undercooked and inedible (mind you this was $12 for basically a hot salad - I don't expect places to charge me less for customizing my food to fit my diet by removing a majority of the dish but this was an extreme situation of suckiness)  I also ordered a spicy Bloody Mary which was garnished with 2 green olives, a 4 slices of not-spicy-in-the-slightest fresh jalapeño, and a giant pickle spear. Oh, and a bottle of Cholula (blessedly still on the table so I didn't have to resign myself to using tabasco on my burrito). Drink was a touch watery, not very flavorful, but not the worst.  Overall, I don't think I'll be returning to US Egg. Everything was lackluster and bland, if even edible."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday afternoon at about 10:30 AM (as I call it, the breakfasting hour...er...half hour). I had 12...TWELVE...hungry family members visiting  me from out of town. Half wanted to cook breakfast at my house. The rest were ambivalent. After whiffing on lunch the previous day (see my scathing review of Harold's Corral), I needed a place to come through.   Enter U.S. Egg.   I'd long been a fan of their Tempe location, but service can vary greatly from one branch to the next. I called and got the owner. He said it was his busiest time of day but once we arrived he could seat us in approximately 10 minutes. He kept his word.   The service was fast and efficient, if not overly friendly (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). My Texan omelette was hearty and satisfying. The rest of my family raved about the protein pancakes, and they were very accommodating to my gluten-free sister. All 12 of us left in a wonderful food coma.   Having failed spectacularly the previous day to find a decent brunch spot, I needed to find a place to deliver me from the harsh judgement of my siblings regarding my ability to pick local restaurants. U.S. Egg saved my ass. Bravo."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my wife and a friend of mine.  The seating and service were very prompt.  Decor was excellent.  Coffee had a bit of a bite to it but was decent.  I had one of their pancake dishes and was impressed with the quality of the food.  They were light, fluffy, and had the right texture.  Their eggs were very fluffy, light, and tasty.  The server we had was very friendly and made us all feel at home.  Her product knowledge was better than some of the waitstaff at four-star restaurants I have been to in either Chicago or Phoenix.    Will I come back here?  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Been there twice now, and both times it was excellent. The food is awesome, portions are huge, and the service is quick and friendly. Great bloody Marys and mimosas too!"}
{"text":"In my breif time spent in Phoenix, AZ visiting the in-laws the spouse managed to talk me into eating at this diner, not far from her old home. Apparently there aren't many good bagel shops in Phoenix as in NYC so the folk there opt for the classier diner to eat their breakfast instead of the way I usually do, on the run.   This diner was actually very good. I ordered the New Yorker Omelet, 'cause of its name sake. It came with hash browns and and an english muffin. Wifey ordered her uzs. a Tuna Melt with fries. The Tuna Melt was delicious.   For breakfasty dessert we got a waffle topped with strawberries, bananas and whip cream. The only thing it was missing was the Nutella, but we substituted it with syrup. By the time my wife was done with it, the waffle was swimming in the stuff.   If I ever venture out to the Grand Canyon State again, which I probably will in the very near future, this is definitely a spot to come and load up on carbs."}
{"text":"Walking distance from my house, the BEST coffee, and consistent service. They are always busy, but have their waitstaff and bus boys running a seamless operation. They can flip a table in no time. I love how they re-decorated and still smile seeing their egg carton and eggshell art. The protein pancakes are bomb and they have an ample outdoor seating area that is nice for a leisurely brunch."}
{"text":"U.S. Egg is a very typical breakfast/brunch type of restaurant, but definitely cleaner establishment and food options.  Arrived very early on July 4th to have breakfast with the family for a small bite to eat prior to their departure. We were greeted by smiling and a large amount of staff at the front door and was served promptly.  My mom and I ordered waffles, I decided to have mine with blueberries and my brother got an egg white omelette which he shared with my dad. The servings here definitely run large and are dense, something to keep in mind. We all got a round of coffee as well. The waffle was okay, the blueberries were very tiny and pellet sized sitting on top of the waffle in a mound ... I suppose this is due to it being Wild Maine blueberries. It reminded me of rabbits for some reason ... They also didn't taste like much, so I doused my waffle in syrup. The waffle was kind of tasteless, dense and was used as a vessel to consume the syrup. An order is about $8 for waffles and more for pancakes.  Service was good considering we were the only ones in there besides maybe 2 other parties early that morning. Meaning prompt service, fast on refills and all smiles.  Docking stars for the mediocre waffle and for prices a bit steep for breakfast and the quality provided. Wasn't exactly wowed here."}
{"text":"Always ask for Allison's section she is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix.  I go every Sunday"}
{"text":"5 stars just on the service alone. Our waitress was attentive and always around. A number of other staff also checked on us including management. They were all nice overall. The food cane fairly quick and was plated nicely. This was our first time and will not be our last.  Normally I read reviews first and I'm glad I didn't because I wouldn't have came. So goes to show that not all reviews are worth taking into consideration."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. I got the jr French toast, hash browns, and a side of ham. Very good. My boyfriend ordered the chicken avocado melt. Fresh avocado. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check this place out and I'm definitely coming back. Was not sure what to get so we went with the servers recommendation of the 1/2 and 1/2. Smaller order of their protein pancakes and a 1/2 order of their skillets. It was really good. The pancakes were great (wasn't sure about them being wheat, but I'm a fan now) filled with blueberries, granola, almonds and cinnamon. I had the veggie skillet; hash browns with veggies topped with cheese and egg. Like I said, I will go back to try more. Think I found myself a new breakfast spot to share with my friends."}
{"text":"Tips:  Recommend getting the half-and-half. Hot skillet dish and 2 small protein pancakes. Protein pancakes are very yummy, can't even tell they're protein pancakes!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The service and food here was great! I came for breakfast on a Monday morning.  We got the meat-lovers skillet with protein pancakes for the Half and Half entree. Very delicious and a great salty and sweet combo to satisfy any cravings.  I got the junior size of french toast which comes with 4 half slices of french toast for $4.99 whereas the normal entree comes with 6 half slices."}
{"text":"The chicken fried steak was fantastic - some of the best I ever had. Not over cooked and perfectly crispy. The mimosa was a bit overpriced - $5 for a small flute. The service was very friendly as well. Definitely somewhere I'd return to."}
{"text":"It's a perfect breakfast/brunch spot . Very busy Sunday mornings but that's just the way I like it on weekends .. To have lot of ppl around . Tried the biscuit and gravy and they were very good . My husband tried one of the speciality omelet ( don't remember the name ) with spinach, mushrooms, onion and tomatoes . He loved it too . The portions are big. We had a tasty and filling Sunday brunch !"}
{"text":"Breakfast at Tiffany's, don't you wish. Nope. Breakfast of Champions.  A family owned breakfast house composed of unequaled dollops of excellent service, specialty waffles, pancakes, bacon 'n eggs, homemade soups, fresh market salads, gourmet sandwiches, juicy burgers, premium desserts.   Today I am enjoying a stand alone, thick, freshly baked, dark Belgium style waffle entree filled with Wild Maine blueberries, granola, cinnamon, slivered almonds plus high quality whey protein topped with butter and maple syrup. 8.29  What really works for me is the whey protein. My hunger is satisfied after a meal that includes whey.  Tasty coffee is served in a thermal carafe so you never have to wait for your server to come around with the pot.   The grand opening is barely 3 weeks old. The interior design looks great. I love the egg carton U.S. flag and map. Well done.  Just wanted to thank all of the Gebran Family for the exemplary experience over the years and to you today Samantha."}
{"text":"Congratulations Oscar on your newest location and Mario for your own store. I had a simple breakfast of 4 eggs over easy and a side of hash browns. $7. Management, staff and the food are always on the money. Good seeing you two again."}
{"text":"Not a bad place I think they have a pretty extensive menu and are pretty consistent in delivering great flavors."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast and staff was very courteous and efficient. Protein pancakes had a great granola and puffy texture. Veggie Benedict was good. Tomato slices were a bit too thick and the sauce dried up... But it was still tasty. A hefty amount of avocado slices. :)"}
{"text":"It was okay and that may be a bit of a stretch! The food was bland and the waitress while she was nice she \"accidentally\" shorted us 50!...the salsa tasted like marinara....the avacado was perfect tho...for that mother nature gets 5 stars for a perfect avacodo....to bad it was wasted on a bland omelette that was paired with undercooked hash browns!"}
{"text":"Super busy but the wait wasnt bad. Best food I have in Arizona. The half and half was perfect combo and the pancakes were soooooooo good as was the skillet. Just perfect!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for my annual spring training trip. Food has always been consistent and incredible till yesterday. Very disappointed. Food was cold, protein pancakes were very bland and not as fluffy and my eggs were not even cooked. Overall just a huge disappointment. Told the server then the manager came to our table and he couldn't really care less. Obviously something has changed. Time to try snooze in Tempe now"}
{"text":"Busy.  Must wait to seat most days.  Yummy granola pancakes, eggs and bacon as you order them.  Friendly.  Freshly pressed apple juice or fresh OJ.  consistent.  Clean.  Friendly.  Small patio with mist."}
{"text":"This place first opened a few years ago near my job it was the ideal meeting location for breakfast and seem to be great.  Whether you are traveling for work nearby or looking for a morning start meal, they have  Wi-Fi available and plenty of table space (just ask the staff and crew for the password). Overall I give the US Egg 3 1/2 star rating as it's pretty good. I kept it simple just pancakes eggs and bacon, while the rest of the family had some items from the kid's menu and daily special, along with some egg benedicts omelet or something.   Like I said food was good but nothing that really blows you away so if you're looking for solid good breakfast and a nice environment with the good stuff I would definitely recommend this location  They do carry \"spiritual libations\" so make sure you order one of their Mimosas or Bloody Mary's if can do it and they served an expansion menu for lunch if you can't make up your mind."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places. Currently pumpkin pancakes are in season. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I frequent the location on bell - always great there - had to be in fountain hills early so I decided to call in an order for breakfast sandwiches. I was on a timeline - that is why I CALLED it in about 20 min before I arrived.  I showed up and it was very empty - only 3 or 4 customers.  Couple waitresses acknowledged me and then another gal came out... I told her I was here for my order - she disappeared and I heard her tell the kitchen I need that on the fly - they asked a few questions that told me for sure it was my order- what is the point of calling in my order of your not going to make it!?? I could understand if it was busy - but it was NOT - nor understaffed.. She never said anything about her mistake or apologized for making me wait an additional 15 minutes for my order  When I got the sandwiches the bread was soggy on one and way over toasted on the other - no salt on the fries and they were very greasy as if the oil wasn't hot enough.   I won't go back to that location!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Quick service! Polite servers! My favorite breakfast place especially because of the protein pancakes"}
{"text":"Definitely a great choice for breakfast and brunch with a good variety of selections.  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"We have had breakfast here every Sunday for the last six months.  But today after giving our name one of our party went to use the restroom.  They refused to seat us because they only seat complete parties.  Really? We won't be back"}
{"text":"Got the Half & Half with protein pancakes and meat lovers skillet.  A good amount of food and it was decent.  I think the protein pancakes standout as being on of the better items on the menu.  Not a cheap place to go for breakfast though."}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast, a lot, and have never been disappointed. The food's great and the staff friendly, courteous and prompt (just ask Lauren!)."}
{"text":"US Egg has become my favorite place for breakfast. Everything I have had on their menu has been great and they have excellent service. Some times there is a wait on the weekends but from my experience it has always been minimal and always worth it."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place other than delivering all the food either overcooked, undercooked, or the wrong version.  My wife ordered the half and half. The pancakes were doughy but sin e our waitress had better things to do she ate the outer sections. Her egg thing with ham bacon cheese ect. Some how came out with chicken instead. My wife eventually got it changed and they were none to happy. She gave her food a 3 star.  My patty melt was ordered medium to MR came out shoe leather super well done. Once again no waitress to complain to. I had also ordered the .95 cent add on bacon to the burger. She instead ordered me a side of bacon for $3.50. She got to pay for that out of her tip money since she would not fix it on the ticket.   Needless to say my dogs ate well. Except for the burger there might have been something wrong with it. I have two hounds who eat most anything but would not finish the awful patty melt for me.  It gets 2 stars for the pancake edges my wife ate and I tried. very good. Would have been nice to have had it all to eat."}
{"text":"I am in Tempe visiting some friends and they suggested U.S. Egg for breakfast since they had been before and really enjoyed it. We got there at 10:20 and were seated about 10 minutes later. By that point we knew what we wanted, since we had checked the menu posted outside by the door and were in a bit of a hurry. Unfortunately, our waitress didn't show. The hostess, possibly manager, came to check on us twice since no one had shown up for some time. She finally took our drink order and had someone drop off our beverages. We still didn't see our waitress for another 10 minutes or so. By this time, we were getting agitated. When she finally did arrive, she took our order and disappeared. Very short, no fluff or greeting. Our food didn't come until 11:30. I looked at my friends, who were confused by the lack of service, and said, \"This is BY FAR the worst service I have ever recieved.\" Our waitress finally reappeared to ask how the food was, and it was good. No disappointment there. But being ignored didn't make up for it. The hostess/manager came by to apologize, which was nice. But when it came time to go, we ended up sitting and waiting again. We were there for a total of two hours. One person in our party had to leave because we there so long. Maybe the fact that is the morning after St. Patty's that had something to do with it, but overall this was a terrible experience. They did take our drinks off of our bill without us even asking, hence the two stars, but it was too little, too late. We didn't tip, which I feel terrible about, but I couldn't justify rewarding the terrible service we recieved. I've worked as a waitress myself before, I know it can be tough, but this was just ridiculous."}
{"text":"What a shame. We anxiously awaited the opening of this restaurant in our neighborhood, but have been seriously disappointed. On our first visit, the coffee was barely luke warm, and the huevos rancheros, which we usually go for were simply mediocre.   On our second visit, i tried one of the skillets. The sausage they used was sliced up cheap links, and the potatoes they used were the frozen shredded variety. It would be hard for me to even rate the meal mediocre.   Sorry to say it's two strikes and yer out for me. There are way too many other very good breakfast options nearby."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here, but when people have to put in their name to wait for a table you should be seated in order of arrival. I was with my daughter and two groups who came in after us were seated first. 3 people group and 1 person group. Then they ended up seating my daughter and I at a table were 4 people could sit. It is the principle of my time is just as important and there are plenty of other places to eat and not have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"We've been saying to ourselves we should try US Egg out, and yesterday we finally did.  Unfortunately, not the best experience.  It's expensive and while you do get a lot of food, what's the point of that if you can't eat it?  I got a skillet (it had hashbrowns, wtf?), the hashbrowns were a greasy, soggy mess, the bacon was undercooked, over easy eggs were over hard and the English muffin tasted like it was steeped in propane to be toasted.  The waitress got my boyfriend's order wrong, almost didn't take his order, seemed she couldn't be bothered to make sure she heard him accurately.  After food was brought out, no sign of our waitress, somehow the check magically appeared, then we had to ask a busser how we were meant to pay (after waiting 15 minutes for our waitress to come back).  My tummy was unhappy for the remainder of the day.  My guy did like his waffle, though he had to wonder why the butter was brown?  It's nice to see so many like this place, I however won't bother again, there are so many yummier, healthier, more reasonably priced places around ($70+ for 4 people)."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon.  Service and food were just ok.  My wife and I each got the 50/50, which includes 2 pancakes and a skillet.  The coffee was very good though."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of U.S. Egg for a while.  We usually come here every time we're in the Pheonix area just for their awesome breakfast.  They have an extensive menu with all the basic breakfast stuff, but they're known for their skillets and also their amazing protein pancakes that are an healthier alternative.  They have good options if you don't want to pig out and their food over all is really good.  The wait on the weekends is ridiculous, but nice touch offering free coffee for those waiting to be seated.  We had a fairly large group and the service was rather poor.  Honestly, I expected a lot more in terms of service.  It's not like they didn't know Saturday mornings get busy.  They need to hire more people.  The service was so non-existent at times where we had to get up and find them to get certain things like place settings, refills, etc.  It was rather annoying.  At one point our service explained to us they were waiting for clean cups so they could pour our juice.  Really?  You're an established restaurant and you don't have enough cups for your patrons?    Note to U.S. Egg owner.  I've made a shopping list for you:  - Hire more people for the weekends. - Don't be cheap.  Buy more cups."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town!!! The half and half is delicious. Its enough food for my husband and I to split. Their coffee is amazing and never ending as they leave a carafe on the table for you. The service is awesome and FAST. We are customers for life."}
{"text":"Excellent food - the protein pancakes are incredible. Go outside of your comfort zone and try them. There were 7 of us and we all enjoyed our meals. When a restaurant can cook eggs to request successfully you know you're in good hands. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Huge breakfast and lunch menu. My girl prefers gluten free dishes so she was happy to see a gluten free menu that includes pancakes and waffles. Protein pancakes are delicious. The Italian omelet is really good as is the Santa Fe skillet."}
{"text":"The pancakes here are delicious. All of the pancake varieties here are great. My preference is the chocolate chip only because I love chocolate. The Italian omelet with pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, marinara and mozzarella is delicious, too. It's like eating a pizza with no bread. I also love the sweet potato fries here. Staff is friendly, courteous and efficient."}
{"text":"The worst food experience.  I wanted to have lunch with my hubby since I work for a company which us close by. I ordered their South West Chiken Salad. My favorite salad from anywhere really. So 1st time here, it sounded good. I ordered it and my waitress was do kind. I forgot her name but she was very nice. BUT as a waitress or as anyone in the food industry, You know lettuce leaves  white and brown or gresy. That's a sign of old or oxidated food. And  no one even botherd to ask is everything was ok or even notice I didn't touch my salad. Disappointing for sure. Haven't gone back since."}
{"text":"Took a client out for Breakfast this morning and ended up here at U.S. Egg.  Even though I work right around the corner . . . I have never had the experience of stopping in for Breakfast.  I was very glad that I did . . . and more importantly . . . the client was very happy also.  I had the protein waffle with a side of bacon and orange juice.  The protein waffle was hot and crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside . . . while the bacon was nice and hot and also crispy.  We were served quickly and  finished before we finished our meeting . . . but still lmanaged to sit at the table and finish our meeting without feeling like they were trying to rush us out.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Waited forever for lunch.  Fries were greasy and Popeye Salad very dry.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We are here at least once a week and both the food and service is always wonderful. Holly always takes very good care of us. Even on weekends when they are very busy the wait is never too long and food comes out very quickly with never a loss of quality."}
{"text":"My favorite outside dining breakfast place.  They are so good about allowing our service dog in training to be with us.  Cameron did a perfect job of waiting on us. AND GREAT FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Tempe, hands down! Mostly b/c of the protein pancakes! He service is great! Sometimes there is a wait, but it's well-worth it! Food always comes out quickly and piping hot! The patio is dog-friendly too!"}
{"text":"When I go to us egg I normally get the protein pancakes which is what I should stick to getting. The foods ok and the service is crap. They don't really do much I ordered water and coffee to start with,they automatically bring you a pitch of water and a coffee pitcher and leave it on the table. Takes up Space and it send the message of \"do it yourself I'm to busy.\" The server also doesn't tell you her name. The servers all hangout close by your table and talk about other customers and partying. I also ordered the blueberry waffle it came with canned blueberries or previously frozen..(gross) I scrapped them off. The waffle alone was ok. Their bacon is good.. That's about it. I then ordered a coke because the coffee was not good and the server drops off two glasses of coke. When I went to tell her I only ordered one she then replied with, they are small glasses so I bring 2 and walked off.. Really is it that hard to make another coke if I was going to order another one? Plus who wants to drink a Watered down coke just because they don't want to come back to the table.  This place is just a whatever breakfast spot if you go to the us egg stick to the protein pancakes and bacon that's the only thing good about this place. Service is not good! And bathrooms are dirty!"}
{"text":"1st trip about 2 months ago was pretty good.  Was there again today and service was poor.  Ordered eggs over medium, were served like they were hockey pucks...told the waitress and she said she would get new eggs for us, but left the our plates on the table for the next 10 minutes letting the ham, hash browns and English muffins get cold.  Why would they NOT put the plates back under the warmer in the kitchen until the eggs were ready?  Manager came over and said she understood the eggs were made incorrectly, I asked her why they would leave our plates on the table...she said 'sorry' and that was it.  Did not offer to offset the bill, nothing, nada, zippo - so I just had to limit my tip and left a note on the receipt saying \"Cold food today - not good\".  How do you screw up eggs?  Ask US Egg....very disappointing."}
{"text":"This US Egg is located in a cute little plaza. I came here for breakfast  with some friends on a Sunday after a hike at South Mountain.  It was pretty busy, with people waiting outside to be seated.  They seated us fairly quickly though, only about a 10 minute wait. Their menu has options upon options, I found it hard to choose.  I went with the bacon, pepper and onion skillet. I was not disappointed. My friend ordered the protein pancakes and those looked really good.  I'll have to order those next time.  I would recommend sitting outside on the patio if the weather is nice. It's a little cramped inside.  You have to squeeze past all the wait staff in the isles if you plan on making a trip to the bathroom. Overall, decent prices and good food!"}
{"text":"Came to visit for spring training. Found this place on yelp and was more than pleased. Sounds crazy but the protein pancakes were awesome. Not your simple hotcakes! Well worth it. Carmine the host and Mariah the server were awesome. Nothing bad to report. Be back tomorrow !"}
{"text":"You know you will have a good experience when your waitress is super nice and friendly, which was our case here with Emily.  Food is always great at US egg.."}
{"text":"Don't underestimate the food portions! I order the skillets and the portion was humongous!  Nice and friendly service. Wish they had a location in LA area."}
{"text":"This place has fast become our favorite breakfast place to go.  The food is very good and the service is excellent. The selections on the menu for traditional, light-eating or gluten-free are very good. And, I really do love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Newcomer to Tempe ! Very impressed and there's NO COMPARISON to Ye Olde Waffle House\". Who serves whole wheat pancakes ? SO GOOD ! The hash browns were so GOOD (they resemble little french fries) I like them extra crispy !  My whole party ... COMPLETELY SATISFIED ! Can't wait to return to the A Z to try something else. Sorry foodies but we were so hungry we forgot to snap a pic. But we are SISTAHS of thickness and trust me ...... if we all agreed that the food was good  IT WAS GOOD !!!! And not to throw shade on the other servers due to us only having one JESSIE was the bomb ! Always smiled and it was OUR pleasure to have her serve us! She made us really feel like OUR business was appreciated ! U S EGG is the spot for a SLAMMIN BREAKFAST !!!! Don't leave Tempe without giving them a try !"}
{"text":"This place is busy so expect a wait. We've always been happy with the service and cleanliness. Today I had the traditional breakfast with eggs over medium hashbrowns English muffin and bacon. My husband had the corn beef hash. We shared a blueberry pancake. It's good food with good service. What else can I say?"}
{"text":"Food is great but it's the service that is truly exceptional!  We go every week for breakfast and they know us by name and have our table ready.  Their wait and bus staff are very well trained and food orders are always correct and delivered fast.  We have a large group and they tend to special order but it's never a problem.  We highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"It's a great breakfast place.Service was good and fast. The place was clean. We were lucky no wait but i heard that this place can be packed on weekends.We definitely will come back here when we visit Tempe again."}
{"text":"The food was OK and the service was great: I was in a rush because I had to catch a flight and they accommodated me even though the place was very busy."}
{"text":"So I've been wanting to go to US Egg for a while but with it being so far out of the way, I just never made it.  We happened upon this one last week so when the weekend rolled around, I knew we'd be visiting.  Now I have seen this shopping center change so many times over the years.  The old movie theater, the indoor mini golf, and now a giant Super Target and a bunch of other weird stuff.  It's a pretty awesome location though, all things considered.  The quoted 15min wait turned into a 5 minute wait since the bar opened up.  Our waitress was awesome and brought my wife two sodas so that she never went empty.  My OJ wasn't bad either so we were off to a good start.  I ordered the Half-&-Half which is supposed to be two small protein pancakes and a skillet meal.  I ordered the Cajun skillet to go with my pancakes and, I gotta say, I was not impressed.  The pancakes were pretty good.  I really liked them but there was no way I could eat a whole order of them.  The skillet, however, was just terrible.  There was no spice, no real flavor other than wet veggies.  I hate when that runny tomato juice flavor ruins everything and that's exactly what happened here.  It was just not good.  Had I stopped with the pancakes, this would have been a 4 star review but that skillet was just bad.  I'd probably go back and order something more simple (like French toast) next time, but that skillet was just bad bad bad."}
{"text":"Stay away!  I have never had a worse breakfast experience. I used to live in the apartments right across the street, so I thought it would be a convenient place for a weekend brunch. Boyfriend and I headed over there one Saturday morning to check it out. I ordered a veggie skillet, and he ordered a make-your-own omelet. The menu description for my skillet said \"fresh cut veggies.\" It came out with cauliflower and crinkled carrots. When I raised that point to our waitress, she giggled and said \"freshly frozen!\" Boyfriend's omelet also came out with only half the ingredients he ordered, and one that he didn't. The only good thing about this place is that they adjusted the check appropriately for our meals."}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've ever had, great service, overall good food and great experience!"}
{"text":"Great food at US Egg l love all of their Idaho Potatoe Skillets, Protein Pancakes and Strawberry Banana French Toast"}
{"text":"Been coming here since 2010 & I love this place, every now and again we'll branch out & try another brunch spot but more than not we wish we just came here. Staff is always friendly, food is always perfect, & the owner Mario is always up front helping out & greeting people which is pretty cool. Two thumbs up for U.S. Egg!"}
{"text":"If they have a waiting list don't bother. They don't seat people in the order of the list. We were a party of two and they took another party of 2 ahead of us even though we had been waiting longer. Lame customer service.  The food is decent but I would not recommend getting a bloody mary."}
{"text":"The protein pancakes!  Whole wheat deliciousness where crunchy almonds and granola fight for a spot in your mouth with the soft blueberries. So good, I don't even look at the menu anymore.   I tried their Santa Fe skillet before I met the pancakes, and, it's not bad either. Actually it's pretty darn good. Blame those pancakes for my subdued review of the skillet. Try both. Go for the combo, between two people. The portions are ample, and, you will get the best of both worlds - sweet and savory.  Service can be patchy. It's been good and bad, both in extremes. Something I can overlook for those pancakes. The patio is lovely, especially when Summer is long gone!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, fast, & fantastic, but the reason we come here from Buckeye EVERY weekend isn't just for the food, it's THE PEOPLE!   Carmine and all of the girls are happy, upbeat and great at what they do. Everyone seems to really enjoy working there and it really shows!    They are busy on weekend mornings (understandably so based on the food and service,) so I would suggest getting there either before or after the breakfast rush; but even if you don't it is completely worth the wait! If you have a big group, I would REALLY suggest calling ahead. I don't know if they even do reservations - but I know they'd probably appreciate a heads up, and since there isn't too much space to wait it could only help you.   I seriously can't say enough about the food and people here. If we didn't live so far away we would probably find an excuse to eat there more than once a week."}
{"text":"We just left US Egg first lost our ticket, then served cold food Management never apologized and refused to comp a meal. Management comped our coffee which was funny as we had the cup of free coffee from outside!"}
{"text":"This place is usually packed on the weekend because it's a good breakfast/lunch spot. You usually don't have to wait too long though so that's good! Service is always superb. Food comes out fairly quickly and is always tasty. It's a clean spot as well. I come when I'm in town visiting and I'll definitely will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for brunch here the other day. We had a nice meal with good service. My friend is a server/ bartender and I was for years, so we like to get to know our server chatting with them a little. We know to respect our servers, but if we want or need something how to ask for things nicely because we understand what it's like to be in their shoes. I ordered a veggie omelet with some modifications and it came out perfectly. I like when you can see that all employees in the restaurant are hustling and working together. I guess the reason why I only gave 4 stars is because I really love breakfast places and U.S. Egg has some stiff competition with other breakfast spots in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Food was very good and the prices were reasonable. The staff members were very attentive. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Meh. Love U.S. EGG, just not this location. The food wasnt nearly as good as other locations. The Tempe and south Scottsdale locations are ALWAYS spot on. Sucks because we now live in North Phx and I adore the protein pancakes."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  In honor of National Pancake Day, I decided to have some pancakes for lunch.  This place is right by work and I had wanted to scope this place out for quite some time now.  I drove over, parked and walked in.    I was greeted by a friendly lady doing double duty as hostess/waitress.  She sat me at a table and told me my waitress would be by in a few.  Turns out that she was the one to actually take my order.  I knew what I was having already so it was a quick turnaround.  I ordered the Protein Pancakes and some water.  They brought over a whole pitcher of water which was nice.  About 10 minutes later, my pancakes arrived.  Here is how they were................  Protein Pancakes ($10.89) -  These things looked amazing.  They are described as \"Pancakes filled with Maine blueberries, granola, cinnamon and slivered almonds\".  They come two to an order and they were presented with a little thing of whipped butter and 2 little things of syrup.  I buttered them up, poured my syrup on top and dug in.  They were delicious!  They overload these things with blueberries, the granola and almonds give it a nice texture and the cinnamon sweetens it up a bit too.  I scarfed them down and barely made it through both of them.  They are really large pancakes!  Are they worth $10.89?  Eh..that could be up for debate.  Close to $14.00 after tax and tip for pancakes is a bit steep IMO.  Will I come back specifically for them?  Probably not.  If someone wants to go to breakfast here and is buying?  Most definitely.  These were some of the best and most unique pancakes I have ever had.  Why only 3.5 stars?  The restaurant itself was odd.  Everything from the hostess stand to the setup of the tables to the music being played.  Something about the place just made me super uncomfortable.  I swear I almost had an anxiety attack there at the table. Maybe it would be better it the place was packed full of people?  I went at about 1:30 in the afternoon and there were maybe 8 other people in the restaurant.  It was eerily quiet.  During my visit, some lady also had some issues with her sandwich being made wrong.  She voiced her opinion about why she was  never coming back to eat there.  It added to the weird ambiance.  Anyways.......... to sum it all up, great pancakes, friendly service, pricey for what you get and a straight up uncomfortable dining area is why this gets 3.5 stars.  I won't say that I will never come back here, but it also won't be in the usual rotation of places to eat either.  It is what it is ;-)"}
{"text":"Today's experience here was not the normal service I get here.   I'm usually really happy with there service and food.    But today's experience was nothing but my normal experience.   My server never smiled,   Took my order, dropped my Ice Tea off and I never saw her again until it was time to pay the bill.   The server in the section next to her ask how I was doing, not my server.   Then I had to ask another server for a Togo box.  Guess my server figured that I have a pitcher of tea At the table so that makes it ok to not come back.   I might have need Tabasco extra pancake syrup...... any way.   Just quite upsetting when I'm a server myself and know proper service and steps to waiting tables.   Left a bad taste in my mouth!"}
{"text":"The U.S. Egg was so great that we went there both mornings for breakfast during our weekend away in Phoenix. There is something for everyone, the menu is huge. The service is great. The portions were huge. We had omelets and shared the blueberries pancakes, which were delicious. Thank you U.S. Egg!"}
{"text":"Great food, and a few unique dishes. My fav is the Dan Marjerle omelet, it has chicken and avocado and is delicious. Of course everyone loves the protein pancakes. One of my top 2-3 breakfast spots in the east valley."}
{"text":"Great selections, great staff. It can get busy on the weekends, but the food is almost always worth any wait. They even brought me a pitcher of soda, to make sure I wouldn't have to wait for refills if they got busy. It was a nice touch, and unexpected since I was the only one at the table drinking soda. They have a selection of Adkins friendly meals, which I appreciated. I've been coming for years and I don't see that changing anytime soon."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was terrible. Us egg.....not good eggs at  all. My husband asked for over easy eggs and got hard ones. I ordered  an omelet but my eggs were hard and tasted terrible. The hash browns were the frozen style and not cooked all the way. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"This place recently opened near my house, and I love good breakfast food, so I was hoping for it to be excellent.  The first thing I noticed when being seated was that the silverware at our table wasn't entirely clean.  Not a good start.  Overall there weren't too many people in the restaurant (4 or 5 tables while I was there), and there seemed to be quite a few servers.  Our drink order was taken quickly, but took a while to fill.  I got a coffee, and asked for cream when it came out, which also took longer than I would have expected to get.  I ordered \"Corned beef hash\", and when the food came out, they brought me a \"Corn huskers\", which is apparently another dish with sausage instead of corned beef.  They took the dish back to resolve the issue and apologized for the mistake.  When it came back out, I am pretty sure they just exchanged the sausage with corned beef on the plate, but since part of the dish was eggs over easy, by this time the eggs were cold.  The dish came with toast, which did not come out with it (Even with the delay), and I feel like if I didn't remind the server, I would not have gotten (Although I could be wrong).  There was also hashbrowns and the corned beef.  Neither were bad per-say, but they were both definitely on the bland side.  I feel like each of the issues I had with this place were small, and could have easily been overlooked on its own (Except maybe the bland food, but I could have tried something different).  The problem was that there were just SO many of them.  The one redeeming factor about the place was that everyone was very friendly.  When the one redeeming factor about a place is not the food, it is hard to justify giving it another try :(."}
{"text":"Had a really great tasting protein waffle and peppers, onions, bacon and egg scramble.  I'll be back. Coffee is not great, but plentiful."}
{"text":"Walking up to this place, you'd think there was no other place in town for breakfast.  We had very high hopes just based on the amount of people waiting to be seated.  Unfortunately, our hopes were dashed after eating.    First of all, as far as service is concerned, they rate high.  This place was C-ROW-DED! My husband and I and our toddler were seated outside on the patio about 20 minutes after we arrived.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  As far as the food is concerned?  Blah!!  I ordered the California Benedict.  The English muffin was toasted which was nice, but everything else was bland as can be.  I asked the waitress to request my eggs poached \"medium\".  One thing having a kid will do to you is change some food habits.  I haven't been able to eat runny eggs since I was pregnant.  \"Sure\" she said with a happy smile.  One egg was completely undercooked, the other was completely OVERcooked... no happy medium.  The hollandaise must have been from a packet.  It had no flavor whatsoever.  Same with the potatoes.  Bland.  Boring.  Yuck.    My husband had the chicken friend steak.  Like the hollandaise, he was certain the gravy was straight out of a packet.    It's so rare that we get out for breakfast, let alone a benedict or chicken fried steak sort of breakfast.  I misjudged the long lines outside and the relatively steep prices.  I don't mind paying $25 for breakfast for two if it's worth it.  But U.S. Egg was definately not worth it."}
{"text":"The name sounds patriotic, even the menu has a gal that looks like \"Rosie the riviter.\" They do not honor veterans at this company. No military discount. If you served, they won't honor your service here."}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast with the family.  We had some business to take care of in Glendale so we treated ourselves to breakfast out afterwards.  Hubby got the Chicken Fried steak and eggs, I had the Arizona Frittata and our daughter ordered the California Benedict.  The food was good.  Would have preferred more hollandaise on the Benedict though.  Didn't have a chance to ask as our waitress (server 310) never came back to check on our satisfaction with the meal so that's why the four stars.  It's sad that it is so hard to find excellent service nowadays.  The menu choices were enough to entice us to check out the locations closer to home.  Also the decor was great.  They have a map of the United States of America done all in eggs and the American flag made of egg cartons!!!  Very nice!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's not a cheap breakfast, but the money is worth it. Huge portions, not to mention great food and service!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for brunch they have the best protein pancakes and you can add fruit to them... yum heaven! They have a huge menu so sometimes it takes a while to decide I think that's my only issue is there are so many choices... but I'm really not complaining. The prices are very fair and the food is really good as well as the service. If coming here on weekends  be prepared to wait but totally worth it in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Met here today for a business breakfast.  In looking around it appears we were not the only ones who thought this restaurant works well for this.  The wait staff were very pleasant and always carried a nice smile.  The kitchen prepares molest with any modification you ask.  I had the protein pancake which was terrific.  Endless coffee via a pitcher on the table is nice so your cup is full whenever you like."}
{"text":"US EGG  Water- 8/10 Ice- 2.5/10 Overall- 5.25/10  Water was good, had notes in it, it was cold; one of the best waters I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. HOWEVER, the ice was salty.  Other than that, service was good. Staff is friendly and the food is edible."}
{"text":"I've tried the typical breakfast places... But this one was way better! I got whole wheat pancakes. They even tasted good!!! It's relatively cheap considering the good is healthy and delicious. Our waitress was very attentive and the decor was cute. I would go back :)"}
{"text":"We met up with some friends here for breakfast while we were in town for spring training and I kind of wasn't surprised it was sooo packed.  Thankfully, we only had to wait 15 or so minutes to get seated.  It was definitely a plus they serve free coffee and water outside to the waiting masses.  I also ended up buying myself a beautiful bracelet for $10 from a lady set up outside.    When we were shown to our table, we noted the restaurant was slightly cramped, with tables pretty close by, to keep up with the demand.  Our booth was comfortable enough, however....until the food started coming.  I'm a corned beef hash fan...can, fresh, homemade, whatevs.  But I asked, just out of curiosity and was told very honesty that it was the can-type but they \"make it very well here\".  Sign me up!  I also got a side of pancake.  Hubby got a pretty standard, two meats, a bunch of eggs and hash brown deal and did his hoovering thing.  The women folk ordered a mimosa that was made with some pink lemonade.  It was actually pretty tasty.  The curious thing was one of us ordered a soda and it was provided in two small tumblers.  When we queried, we were told that's how they do it.  Cool?    Food was well done, home cooking...you know, like when your mom's/husband's/lover's feeling guilty about something and wakes up early the following morning to make you a giant breakfast instead of your usual cold cereal or donut.  No complaints here!  I can see why this place is so popular but next time, I think we'll give some other breakfast joint a shot, too."}
{"text":"All I have to say is, protein pancakes. They are seriously out of this world. I usually get the half and half with a skillet and the smaller version of the pancakes. Seriously, they can't be beat. If you take sugar in your coffee and are into the healthier trends, they have stevia by request too! Lots of menu choices, and consistent quality. It's on my list of regular spots!"}
{"text":"Food definitely good and delicious. I had the New Yorker which contains your meat and veggies with some sauce on it. It is a good atmosphere trying to put eggs as decorations is a creative way of doing it."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that anyone likes this place. Seriously, people wait in line for a LONG time here on the weekends....it blows my mind! I went here this morning with the BF and it was terrible! I got the veggie benedict with the hollandaise on the side (there's always too much sauce on these things...) and it just wasn't very good. The eggs were hard boiled....like chalky gross yolks...pretty not awesome. The tomatoes were mealy and the avocado was a bit brown. Additionally, there was a bit of mystery meat that somehow ended up on my plate...pretty unappetizing. The potatoes were pale, flavorless, and greasy...not worth eating. I ended up just eating the egg whites with the english muffin....real great breakfast for 10$. The BF got a blueberry pancake and bacon. The bacon was extremely fatty and the pancake was dry. I think the best part about this place is that it saved me a lot of calories....other than that, it was too expensive, loud, and all around not tasty. Definitely would not go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. We will be back and recommend the omelets and waffels."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!! Gluten Free French Toast was amazing!! Very friendly. Quick and efficient. Def would recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 5 or 6 times now in the last 3 months and for good reason, the food is awesome! I've sampled some of the burgers and they have been unique and tasty every time. I never (neeever!) Order a chili burger but their's had fries in it so I had to try it. It did not disappoint! They aren't as cheap as if you we're going to Denny's but it's worth the price and the basic breakfast platter is a steal at $8. They have some of the best bacon I've ever had.   The last time I went I tried one of their famous protein pancakes, with granola, and blueberries, and it was sooo good! I don't even like blueberries in my pancakes! You even have your choice of ordering half of one of their yummy skillet breakfasts with a protein pancakes which let me tell you is the best of everything.  It's $10 and some change but worth it and very filling.  This is making my mouth water.  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"It's our first time here. Recommended by a personnel from Sheraton. Decided to have breakfast before going back home to West Covina, Ca. Glad that hubby and I decided to have brunch.  Host and server named Emily was very friendly and welcoming. Love the part where hubby ordered ice tea and I had coffee... They just left a pitcher of ice tea and a pot of coffee for us to refill ourselves. Food is great! We'll definitely return to US Egg when we're back to Arizona!"}
{"text":"I'm SO glad I finally had a chance to check this place out!  I ordered their Protein Waffle & it was fantastic!  Not only was it HUGE, it was also very filling & delicious.  With generous portion sizes, great food, reasonable prices & friendly wait staff, I can see why this place is always packed. I will most certainly be a repeat customer. :)"}
{"text":"Okay. The protein pancakes are no joke. Sooo delish i have been trying to make em at home.   The blueberries provide enough flavor it requires just a tad bit syrup.   The skillet was decent. It wasnt wowzahs but maybe the pancakes were just that good. I got the santa fe skillet. In my opinion its better without chorizo. I messed up!! Keep in mind im vegetarian 6x/week.  Santa Fe skillet: chicken, tomato, chorizo, green chile sauce. I reckon extract chorizo and add bell peppers, mushrooms, onions and green chile or jalapenos.  The green chile sauce has more kick than i thought. Initially i was like this sauce is just green food coloring so i added a few tobasco ounces and shirtly after i was a dragon. It was edible but not as comfortable.   The hash is standard. Wouldnt be surprised if its from a bag (commercialized) rather than freshly cut from a real potato.  The english muffin was ok. Jam selection sucked.  Service was great as amaaazing.   Thank you Arizonians fir such great hospitality."}
{"text":"Wonderful service! Our food was delicious! Thank you U.S. Eggs for the great experience."}
{"text":"First time here. First off the food is just ok. The scrambled eggs were like rubber. The biscuits and gravy were salty. I ordered a  dt coke. My server said she would keep them coming which apparently means 1 refill. Food not worth the price. Secondly the service. My server spent most of the time I was there talking to the man at the booth by mine. She seemed more interested in him than taking care of the rest of her customers. I don't believe I will be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Very clean. Good customer service. Great food. Nice family place. Enjoyed a nice breakfast with my mom."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast at US Egg. We usually go to the Chandler location but decided to go here on our PHX vacation.  Sat out in their outdoor patio which was perfect on a \"fall\" AZ day.   Both my wife and I ordered the half/half skillets with protein pancakes. I got the mushroom and sausage which was excellent. Hot and quick out of the kitchen. The pancakes are what we always get and they were delicious.   Great overall experience, will definitely go again."}
{"text":"FOOD/OJ POISONING AND POOR MANAGEMENT: I am 100% healthy and have not been sick in over a year. I woke up completely happy and well. All was great. I met a friend at this US Egg (sadly Mark's Cafe was closed because of a death) and spent about two hours there catching up with my friend. I had a full glass of orange juice, and about 6 bites of my food. Something felt wrong after about 60-90 minutes. Before leaving I was sick multiple times (out of both ends). I did not say anything before we left the restaurant -- I just wanted to go home. I could not think straight. I barely made it home and was sick again (again, from everywhere). From my bed, I called the management simply to give them a heads up so that no one else would be affected. THIS IS WHY THEY GET ONE STAR -- His response was that it was not from their food. Period. That this was not their fault. That is horrible! I did not ask for money or anything. I was trying to help and he was unprofessional (and incorrect)! That pathetic response made me ALMOST as sick as their food. Forgetting and emotion you may infer from my review, it really was a poor experience (except for the waitress -- she was great and we tipped her well)."}
{"text":"I love US egg. I tried the protein pancake combo thing, and it was so filling and satisfied my cravings for savory and sweet in one dish. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Definitely one of our favorite breakfast spots in Tempe! Fast and friendly service, nice outdoor patio with misters, and always delicious food. My favorite is the Avocado Jack omelette and my boyfriend Loves their Biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Having just dropped off my better half at Altered Ego an opportunity was presented to try US Egg for breakfast. Sitting here now after having the California Benedict. Its 8:45 and the place is pretty busy. Plenty of booths and tables with an outdoor patio. The restaurant is clean, service was fast and friendly. My food was tasty and filling. I would not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"This is the location I frequent most (it helps it is less than a mile from my home).   I have been to a U.S. Egg (this and other locations) more than a dozen times (or two) since moving to AZ in 2010. I love breakfast food and the \"specialty\" won me over instantly; PROTEIN PANCAKES! As the timeless Tina Turner once said, \"Simply the Best!\". That describes these pancakes perfectly.   Before I go on and on about the pancakes (because I have been known to do so) some background information about atmosphere, staff etc.   This location is in a nondescript one story building in front of the offices at Mill Towne Center (or is it Mill Town Centre?). Nothing fancy, but I don't need a \"Jacket Required\" sort of feel to a place to enjoy my breakfast.   The staff is fantastic; hosts/hostesses, waitresses, busboys. I have never had anyone employed here be anything but 100% professional and attentive. To speak to something others have mentioned about getting the check early (while they are still eating); as long as you continue to be my waitress (i.e. refills, requests for jelly, etc.) I don't care if you bring the bill with the food. If I decide I want something else, I doubt any of the folks here would have a problem reprinting a corrected bill. Now on to the food!!   The protein pancakes are filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and silvered almonds. The ingredients aren't something exotic, but they are perfectly balanced in the mix (not too much or too little of any of them). The thing about any food item you like at a restaurant, it becomes a favorite because they are able to duplicate it time after time. I have had this item many times (more than any other item), and they are always spot on (knock on wood) :).   All the other dishes I have had (always breakfast, haven't tried lunch yet) were some combination of eggs and protein, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked to my specification (over medium), and the meat always juicy.   I promise to write another review as soon as I don't get the protein pancakes (which will be when they decide to remove them from the menu - NEVER). :) Oh, or if I actually go in later than normal and feel like lunch over breakfast (not good odds :O)."}
{"text":"Pros: has some unique dishes / breakfast choices.  Large menu.  Protein dishes.  Cons: service varies, sometimes downright aloof or rude considering they will be making $15 /hr min wage, food is on the expensive side."}
{"text":"The food and service is great!  Lots of interesting choices.  The manager is always there and checking to make sure that everything that we ordered is to our liking and thanks us for coming in.  The wait staff is great about listening to what our allergies are and makes sure our meal comes the way we ordered it!"}
{"text":"It was between this and iHop. This was my first time in Arizona and I must say this place is pretty good. The chicken was really tasty and the French toast was good as well. Only downside to this place was the water. Which for some reason is nasty compared to New York! But that's everywhere in Arizona. I would definitely recommend this spot it's good."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal at US Egg.  The service is always so good and today was no exception.  Usually I have eggs Benedict but broke out of my shell and had French toast and eggs.  They made my partner a traditional Aussie breakfast which he appreciated.  Tried the bloody Mary for the first time.  Yum yum yum.  Super good with pickle and olive garnish.  I always appreciate when the Manager at restaurants rounds. I told him today just how good the service was."}
{"text":"Little bit pricey but definitely very good. Amazingly friendly and helpful staff.  You must try the half and half. Simply Sublime! Sorry but those words really don't describe how good it is"}
{"text":"Good breakfast pretty much all the time. I love the half and half meat lovers breakfast.         ...          .           ."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about US egg. When it comes to 'chain' breakfast and lunch joints they have everyone beat. I have come to this location probably 20-30 times and am never let down. The service is always great, the portion sizes are hefty for the price and the manager is always visible and helping.  There's really nothing that I would approve upon. Management is great, servers are genuinely sweet and speedy and the food is great. Always hot and always fresh! I got the Sonora burrito but I've also gotten the BLT which is HUGE and super yummy too! I love all the vegetarian options for my husband and you get a lot of food on the kids menu for 4.99 for the little ones!  I want to give a special shout out to Parker for keeping up with all of our needs when she was a hit overwhelmed. Still always came with sweetness and a smile! See y'all next weekend. Keep doing what you're doing :)"}
{"text":"Recently went on a high protein , low carbs diet. I went to US Egg for breakfast. Went there for the Protein and green choices. Had a 7oz grilled chicken patty, egg beater eggs, spinach and tomatoes, with coffee. I also asked for some fruit on the side.  The meal was generally good , the chicken was just average and the fruit had items I could not eat ( only the apples and orange slices were in my diet) The biggest shock however was getting a bill for $25.00.!! the coffee was $3.00 and the fruit was I believe close to $6.00. That made the main meal $14.00. Never had a basic breakfast cost so much. That breakfast should have cost $15.00.   Since this visit I have been to 5 other breakfast places including Snooze, First watch, Black Bear , IHOP and Butterfield's and the prices were between $13.00 and $18.00 for basically the same items I got at US Egg which cost $25.00. They should lower their prices !!!"}
{"text":"I came here a few times now and it's definitely safe to say it's my new favorite breakfast place! No matter who our server is, we always get amazing service. Keep up the delicious breakfast and fast service! Thanks Felicia for our recent visit."}
{"text":"First time breakfast here and very pleased with the overall service, food and cleanliness of US Egg. We were greeted with a friendly smile and seated in less than 5 minutes. Our server arrived shortly after being seated, again with a warm smile, less than 5 minutes later.  I remind you, this is all during Mother's Day breakfast and this place was packed.  Shortly after receiving our drinks, our server took our order. Our food arrived hot, fresh and delicious. I had the eggs Benedict and would definitely order it again. If I had anything to say about improvement, it would be a couple drops of lemon juice in the hollandaise sauce for added freshness.  This is just a personal preference.  The food was delicious, service was great; we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch during PodcampAZ. Good atmosphere, very breakfasty, which is what you would expect. I had a spinach/mushroom omelet, which was wonderful. I'm usually worried the eggs will be overcooked and dry, but it was pretty perfect. The potatoes were a bit undercooked. My sis-in-law had their pumpkin pancake, which was HUGE. She said it didn't have a lot of pumpkin flavor, but it was good. Nice brunch! I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a breakfast place that isn't Denny's or Village Inn."}
{"text":"I am in love with the protein pancakes here!  If you've never had them, try them.  They are pancakes filled with oats, blueberries, and I forget what else, but they taste delicious.  Especially covered in the side of softened fluffy butter and syrup they serve it with!  The texture is not exactly like the traditional fluffy pancake you are used to, but I still love them.  I just with they would update their decor a bit, as some of the carpet and stuff is starting to look worn."}
{"text":"Took the advice on Yelp and tried this place and their Protein Pancakes...really good!  A great combination of granola, blueberries and cinammon in a big pancake that completely covered the plate.  They also set down a full pitcher of water and carafe of coffee...thank you very much! This place should be a lot busier."}
{"text":"I very much like this location in North Phoenix. It's easy to find, there's plenty of parking, and the staff is genuinely nice and caring. It's also the only US Egg that has a counter (or so I've heard), which makes it perfect for a solo breakfast, instead of occupying an entire table. Valerie took care of me yesterday and she was top notch. I went with the Stars and Stripes Waffles, which I remember It came with regular blueberries. This one was with wild blueberries, which I did not enjoy much but it's no biggie. I know what to ask for next time.   I also love the fact that they come to you promptly with coffee...\"yes please!\". Can't do a thing without my coffee. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for breakfast. The food is always good, and the service always very friendly with very pretty young women. My favorite thing to get is either the triple play with bacon, eggs over easy or the half and half with the Santa fe and egg over easy. I've had other items on the menu and they have all been good, from the chicken and waffles to the blt which is huge and super fresh. I definately recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Eggs Benny is great. The fruit was on point too. I'm not a fan of grapefruit but it even looked good enough for me to eat! This is our second time here and it doesn't dissappoint. Staff was great both times. However and this why I did not five 5 stars, this older guy sitting by the hostess stand was snorting up a storm! It was so gross that I couldn't finish eating. The first couple times it took me by surprise and I immediately looked in his direction and he was just stating at me like \"what ?\". Then after that and for the next 5 times I had it together enough to not look over. I'm not 100% sure but I think he is the owner.  Course I was ear hustling and that what it sounded like. So disgusting sir, please go to the bathroom and blow your nose. Your guests do not want to hear that....and then have you stare at them. We were even kinda talking about it loud enough for him to hear and it did not change anything."}
{"text":"So I went to US Egg because I really wanted an omelette. So bad did I want an omelette. And I figured, what better place then a restaurant called Egg!  When I got there there was a 5 minute wait at noon, which was fine. I was seated and got my water pretty quickly. I had already looked at the menu and I got the Hawkeye. Which is chicken, avocado, tomatoes, bacon and jack cheese. I added onions.   It arrived fairly quickly and was amazing! The hash browns and English muffin were really good too. (I mixed the omelette stuffing that had fallen out with the hash browns--yummy!)   However, the service was bad. Pretty bad actually. My waitress seemed to almost ignore me. It took almost 10 minutes to get a side of salsa from her AFTER I asked for it (which took forever as well).   Then, when I'm not even halfway through my meal she brings me my check. I was sitting there, fork halfway to my mouth when she just sets it on the table, says \"no rush\" and walks away. I don't know how long she's been a waitress but you NEVER bring a check when someone is still eating. Certainly not when they have just reached the middle of their meal.  She never came back until (she decided) it was time to pick up the check. I had been sitting there, with my credit card in the sleeve, with an empty plate (silverware neatly on the plate) for more then 10 minutes before she took it.  Needless to say I did not tip. Which is sad because I'm a 25-30% tipper on average.   So, overall, very good food, very bad service."}
{"text":"Always great service and great food.  We don't come as often as we like given 2 young kids and the potential for long wait times but when we do we are always happy we did.  The skillets are a great choice and wife always loves the corned beef hash.  Always have option of solid lunch items to boot.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband really likes this place and raves but it's not as good as the prices say it is. 10 dollars for just a BLT is a little much. I do love their pumpkin waffles and will go any time during that season to eat those. Everything I've had is good, but the prices are a little high."}
{"text":"Goodness gracious I love their protein cakes and garden veggie omelet. It's really quite embarrassing to hit this place thinking I'll be eating healthy and eat way past full because it's so yummy. The only thing that I do not like here is their coffee. No flavor. Stick with water or the over-priced juice."}
{"text":"Great service, there was no wait time. They left the coffee carafe at our table which was nice.  Very clean and every worker has great smiles and a friendly attitude.   One of my our favorite breakfast places."}
{"text":"Had an amazing Breakfast here yesterday, eggs and bacon were perfectly cooked and love the pitcher of iced tea. Server was happy and a ray of sunshine early in the morning so a pleasant surprise for breakfast places, I can't remember her name but beautiful red hair. Will definitely be back and maybe try a Mimosa or two."}
{"text":"We are regulars, eating here almost every weekend. Fast, friendly service. Great food with good portions. Great home style cooking. It can get very busy on weekends, but they turn the tables fast. Great patio for outdoor dining."}
{"text":"I have been to both the Scottsdale and chandler locations. Both were very consistent in food, service, and ambiance. The only issue at Scottsdale was too many uninvited friends - the flies.   The Chandler location had great food, service, and ambiance. The decor is like my grandma's kitchen."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast restaurant I have ever been too.  My fiancé and I are huge chicken fried steak fans and this place by far has the best.  From California, to Arizona, to Washington, to Canada, to even my fiancé's moms chicken fried steaks(don't tell her I said that).  The service here is incredible and the owner is a great great guy and very nice and cares for his customers.   I would definitely try it this place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"For how hard they advertised and the price on the menu. I was sure disappointed. The food is on quality with Denny's including the plastic cups and water spotted silverware."}
{"text":"We happened to be driving in the area looking for somewhere to eat and decided to try US Egg. My husband and I both got breakfast items and our daughter had kids' chicken strips. We were all pleasantly surprised at how yummy everything was! The hash browns Were especially good. Our server was very nice and personable, the restaurant and restrooms were clean, and the decor is unique."}
{"text":"Great place. Been coming here since they opened. Glad they opened here. Great home style food. Good prices great portions. Owner greats you at the door. Friendly environment and great staff. Been here many times and will continue to return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Service was very fast which was amazing, but the food was nothing to write home about. My first experience was the veggie eggs Benedict, which was bland. The hollandaise sauce didn't taste like much of anything and the hash browns were burnt that came out as well. The friend I was with was in such a hurry or I would've had this corrected. The second trip I had the omelette with jack cheese and avocado. Let me say, be ready for an avocado sliced into fourths thrown between eggs that are cooked in the shape on an omelet with cheese thrown on top. This was almost like having frozen eggs and trying to make them taste better with an avocado. The good part was the salsa, which was pretty darn tasty. After giving it two go's, I won't be coming back to this place again. There are far too many good breakfast joints around town."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviews this place!  I LOVE US EGG! Any time we ever have family in from out of town, we'll eat here almost every day while they're here. Not only is the food good, but with me having Celiacs, it's always difficult to find a place that not only offers gluten free foods, it also tastes good and also actually understands the necessary precautions of gf foods. Their gf French toast is amazing, and the gf burgers are also wonderful!  Everyone in my family loves it and we'll always be loyal customers!"}
{"text":"Simply put, dining at U.S. Egg for brunch was A-OK. We were lucky not to wait long for a table and that our server was attentive but to be quite honest, nothing really made our visit there memorable. Sounds terrible but the best thing about my meal was the fact that our server left the water pitcher and coffee thermos on the table for us so we wouldn't have to wait for refills. That's something on my wish list for every restaurant as I drink a ton of water.  Anyway, the customer service was good. We didn't have to wait for a table and we didn't have to wait long for our food. Portions were huge but food was overall mediocre. Eggs were a bit bland and the hash browns were a bit soggy. I liked the decorations; they were really patriotic. My favorites were the huge map of America marking all of their locations and a U.S. flag made out of egg cartons. Other than that, I'd survive not ever eating at U.S. Egg again."}
{"text":"Good Breakfast House. I had the Breakfast Sandwich: Add Avocado and onion and it's great. Service was very mechanical...not all that friendly, but, the overall experience was good enough to keep it at 5 stars.   I was told that they have some way out pancake meals. Sounded interesting for those that like to explore new frontiers."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. The server was great. Decor was good. I sent back the Over Raw Eggs, got over easy eggs (I ordered over medium) I did not eat them. My Grand son ordered the Jr Big Pancake. He ate all the Pancake with a special surprise underneath. A 6-9 inch Hair. Manager comp part of the Breakfast only. I paid for the Hair Only. You decide!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and am never really that impressed. The place is always crowded and loads of diners waiting to grab a seat but I don't understand ... it must be me. Tried the protein pancake and it wasn't cooked all the way through - the middle was still wet. Ick. Flavor of the pancake was decent but nothing to rave about. One friend tried the egg breakfast - good but hash browns were undercooked and another the protein waffle - very good. Service is very good here and the place is clean. But are they hurrying with the food to seat the diners waiting? I don't know but I probably won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast they are always friendly and food is great! Also they let me bring my dog which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast here about a month ago and now that I am sitting down to do the review I find that neither of us can remember what we ate or how the service was or anything remarkable about the experience at all.  It was completely forgettable.  If you like generic chain restaurant breakfasts, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact that I absolutely love breakfast/brunch places. With that being said... Here's my review:  Food: The protein pancakes were done RIGHT! Wheat batter filled with oats, blueberries, cinnamon and slices of almonds. Never tried protein pancakes well.... Here's your chance. A healthier option to carb loaded pancakes and it still satisfied the taste buds on levels I cannot explain. :) the Idaho skillet I ordered we my half & half was perfectly portioned. Hash browns topped with ham, sausage, cheese, onions and eggs. The ham was tasteful. The sausage was sliced into a size that was easy to eat with every bite and evenly spread throughout the skillet. My friend got the spinach florentine with jalapeños and avocado added, and let me tell you.... It's a must try. My FAVORITE part of this whole experience... the food did not make me feel like I just ate a whole pound of oil. I felt satisfied, full but I definitely did not feel like I walked into a bar and chugged a cup full of fatty foods and that my friends is a wonderful feeling after eating breakfast foods.   Customer Service: we were seated within seconds of walking in. The host and the waitress greeted us with such pleasure. Made us feel welcomed. I like that feeling :) Throughout our visit our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. Our drinks were taken and delivered quickly. She left the water pitcher on the table for our own refill service... I for one like this but I know many people that don't. She didn't check on us too much so it didn't become an annoyance. The food didn't take too long especially for the taste it delivered. Overall great customer service.   Environment: it has a small village/ihop kind of feel. Both booths and tables available. The servers are in uniformed shirts but you can tell they're a casual environment. Kid friendly."}
{"text":"We had been here before it was US Egg and it was awful!  We tried it today after Easter service with my mother and it was terrific.  I had the high protein pancake (half order) and it was great.  My mom's corned beef hash was good - a large serving. The hubby's omelet was a good serving and fresh.  The coffee was not swell but the food made up for it.  Nice friendly staff and great service."}
{"text":"Food Awesome!!!!!! Staff Awesome!!!!!! Taste Awesome!!!!!! Veggie burger Awesome!!! Pan cakes Awesome!!! ambiance Awesome!!!!!  When ever i am in phoenix i won't miss going to this."}
{"text":"Meh.   Coffee is meh. Only thing I really loved was the fresh squeezed orange juice. Our breakfast was meh. Nothing outstanding.   We don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"9am on Saturday morning and us egg is at 80 percent plus capacity 3 people greeted me at the waitress stand when I entered and was seated immediately - ordered two eggs and has browns and toast and four pieces of bacon for 8.69 - ordered coffee and water - I walked a mile here so I am thirsty - waitress left the coffee and water jugs - food just arrived at least enough to stuff 2 people everything cooked to perfection - Mckenzie is my waitress - very high energy and attentive - food was served in less than 5 minutes - there is an army of servers and hostesses and managers and buss people it's a well oiled machine"}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast I've EVER had in a restaurant. Truly! You've got to try their protein pancakes! I'm going to try to make them at home...."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place out and I finally did on a Wednesday for brunch. Image atmosphere was very clean and cute. I had the Angus patty meal. It was alright. My friend had the waffles. He thought they were good. Service was friendly but I felt was kind of slow.. I overall rate this place as decent, it wouldn't be my first choice but I would return if I was to lazy to drive anywhere else because I live down the street. Haha"}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious food delivered quick and piping hot with a smile. At a steal quite honestly. The coffee is excellent and you can sweeten it with stevia too. This is my fourth time here and the service is always friedly and spot-on. Right now I have to get back to enjoying my scrumptuous Santa Fe skillet plate and fabulous protein pancakes before they get cold...Ta!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers! Took your advice since we are out of town and wanted some great breakfast. All our meals were delicious. On advice of Yelp I got the half and half, which is two small protein pancakes (not low carb, but they are whole wheat with blueberries, cinnamon, granola, and slivered almonds)- the rest was any of their skillet combos. Mine was potatoes with chx, avocado, bacon, and tomato, with an egg on top.  Seriously enough for two...! We will be back there this week!  (Update - we DID go back and it was just as great the second time around.  Place was packed at 9:30 on a Friday morning!)"}
{"text":"I usually arrive for a late breakfast, and this place always has a line out the door.  They can't all be wrong, right?  They're not.  The food is great, the service is good, and they do a great job communicating with each other when things are at their busiest.  I remember running into their owner when they opened their new location (Chandler I think it was?) and if I remember right (Brothers own the stores?).  Either way, I have been to multiple locations of theirs, and it is a pleasure every time.  This one however, is my favorite, although I wish it was bigger so the line wasn't as long.  Family friendly and despite how busy it is, you never feel rushed.  Not a fan of the way they do rye toast, but am a fan of the eggs."}
{"text":"This place is alright.  There's really nothing remarkable to say about it other than when I asked for a Diet Coke to drink, the girl gave me two glasses and kept them constantly full.    When we came in, it was pretty busy and we were quoted a short 10-15 minutes.  We waited for a bit until we heard that the \"bar\" was open so we made ourselves comfortable there.  The menu is really big and honestly, too hard for me to look at.  The print is pretty small.  I decided to keep it simple since pretty much everything on the menu seemed to have stuff I don't like in it.  I chose the Belgian (not Belgium people!) waffle with a side of bacon.  The waffle was okay.  It was filling and tasty, but it was lacking that crisp exterior that makes these big waffles so good.  The bacon was a little overcooked for my taste, but not bad.  I probably wouldn't come back unless we were absolutely starving and happened to be in this area because places like this are pretty much a dime a dozen."}
{"text":"Food here is amazing and they have a lot of gluten free options. Definitely one of my favorite breakfast/lunch spots!"}
{"text":"Service was so fast, I felt like they didn't want me there.   I got eggs, bacon, sausage, and fruit. The fruit was fantastic, fresh. The eggs were good. Sausage good. Bacon good. Overall, food was good, not great.   I'd give another half star if I could."}
{"text":"Location: restaurant has lots of booths and tables available. When the weather is nice, the patio area is awesome.   Service: staffs are friendly but a bit slow. It is understable during busy hours. The owner and the hostess is very welcoming. Our waitress was as attentive as she could be during busy hour.   Food: I ordered a banana waffles with eggs and sausages. Waffle is fluffy and big enough to get me full. I ordered eggs sunny side up and it turns into over easy. Its ok :) it still tastes good.   Rating: I will definitely come back here again. The only reason I didn't give it 5 star is because the staffs who clean up tables were making so much noise. Our waitress couldn't even hear us when we ordered our food."}
{"text":"The staff is here is beyond friendly. I had the tuna melt and it was one of he best I ever had. My wife had the protein pancakes and they are out of this world. Our waitress Felicia was very attentive. I'm sure everyone else is as nice but she went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our meal. Her upbeat personality just enhanced the dining experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. We were seated rather quickly (in less than 20 seconds to be exact). Once we were seated the waitress immediately asked what we wanted. I felt rushed throughout the ordering process but I can't really blame her because they were pretty busy.  However the food was pretty good. I enjoyed the fact that they offered this item called half & half where you got a protein pancake (smaller size) along with your choice of a hot skillet.  The food was delicious too! I would definitely come back."}
