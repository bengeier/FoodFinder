{"text":"I ordered delivery from here recently and was pleasantly surprised. I had read previous reviews that had me putting off ordering from here. But, when I was moving and had nothing to cook with or eat with since it was packed up, I ordered from here. And the delivery time was about on par for other places. It was a bit busy when I ordered, given it was right around lunch time. But when it was delivered, it was still hot and yummy. The volcano chicken, one of their lunch specials was good; it came with rice and crab puffs. The happy family was good as well. This is a place I'd order from again. Oh and I did like the fact that when you get delivery and use card, they bring the card reader with them rather than giving my card number over the phone."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and they said it would take about an hour...not ideal, but I really wanted some chinese. I finally got my food a little over 2 hours later. No apology from the delivery guy, which would have been nice. The food tasted okay...probably helped out by the fact I was so starving by the time it arrived."}
{"text":"Prob the most screwed up restaurant in Scottsdale. If you like to dine in dirty, outdated dive bar style restaurants so small you literally eat as one big family with strangers, who by the way consisted of drunk kids from the skatepark next door and large individuals who pretty sure spent most their time in jail. Your in heaven. They even have this bartender who you can read about in other comments who I'm certain is on Breaking Bad's blue meth. Nobody can talk as loud and as much as this guy. It's really quite the show. The little server girls who probably get lashed by bamboo canes from this guy are nice, the food was hot with good portions are the only thing they have going on here. Be prepared if you accept this challenge."}
{"text":"This is by FAR the best Chinese in Arizona. I've been going here for almost 8 years and the food gets better every time I go there! Robby, the bartender, is a great guy! If your from out of town, this is a place to check out!!! The orange chicken & lettuce wraps are amazing. This is a great date place that will be easy on your wallet, and the service is amazing! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"How does this place have anything more than a 1 star rating? Let's start off with why you SHOULD NOT eat here.

1.) The food is garbage. Probably a literal statement, too. I've eaten here twice, just because I believe in second chances and MAYBE my first time was a one off thing. NOPE. I ordered their Phoenix & Dragon dish the first time, which had zero flavor. I mean, at all. You could boil a piece of college ruled paper and get a better experience for your taste buds. The second time I decided to order what I thought was orange chicken. Let me tell you, if that is what orange chicken is, then I've been lied to for years. What I ate was a fried ball of batter with a piece of chicken no bigger than that you would find in a can of chicken noodle soup inside, drenched in some sort of sauce that is horrid enough to make you throw up upon receiving the dish. I'm fairly certain their food is just microwavable dinners you pick up at Fry's. Why? Because I've seen the \"manager\" carry about 8 bags full of them into the restaurant. How can you even call this food?

2.) The staff/service is worse than what I imagine you would get in prison. Every person there is rude, save for one little Asian lady. I like her. My main concern is the bald guy who calls himself the manager or owner or what have you. I don't think I've been in his establishment, no, the parking lot of Fry's without wanting to smack him. This guy is reason enough not to go, but I'll get more into that in a bit. Bartender? What a joke. Sure, $1.50 Bud Lights is awesome, but I'd rather buy a 6 pack and catch a buzz watching paint dry than have to sit there and listen to that guy talk. Holy ignorance. I'm 95% sure he's nothing more than a racist bigot/lookout (more into the lookout part coming up). Seriously, he's just a prick.

3.) This is my final reason. If you still are considering this place so far, you're about to think a third time. I'd be willing to bet my life savings that this place is a front for drug laundering. Seriously. Back to baldy. He's had the cops called on him MULTIPLE TIMES for dealing in front of the place with the local druggies and even some cab drivers. I've actually witnessed that. I've also witnessed him around 9:30-10pm, running around the Fry's parking lot just absolutely drugged out of his mind. He sings, screams at people, talks to himself, etc. Basically anything you'd expect a druggie to do. Don't believe me? Fine, go in there at night and tell me he's not on something. The cops have been there multiple times, including for him harassing employees of the neighboring establishments while he's under the influence. He definitely missed the D.A.R.E. seminar in gradeschool.

So, those are my reasons that you should avoid this place. Unless you're into drugs and harassment or posting hilarious Instagram/Vine/Facebook videos of people out of their minds, then go crazy."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmm yummy. Good shrimp lo main. All I ever order. I like the wantons that come with the lunch. The egg rolls are not wonderful and I always trade someone for their wantons. Today the salad was hot and lettuce was wilted not crunchy.  But normally good. There white guy driver drives like a maniac on the road and flips people off (I recognised him on the street) but is nice in the restaurant.  I always eat here for lunch."}
{"text":"I did not care for the food here. I was really looking forward to the Almond  Boneless Chicken and it was nothing like I expected. Almond Boneless Chicken is a staple in Chinese restaurants in the Detroit area where I moved here from and this dish wasn't even close. I was so bummed but had to eat it anyway since we got carry out. I didn't like it or the eggrolls. Sorry! We also got Sweet and sour chicken which was fine."}
{"text":"Big fruity drinks, $1.99 Heiny's. $3.99 'bombers

Awesome greasy fried rice, eclectic local crowd. Don't come here with a Scottsdale attitude."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I got horrible food poisoning for 3 days after eating here. BEWARE!!!!!!!

The service is also subpar. I don't understand why they have any reviews over 2 stars..."}
{"text":"The food is good. I've been there quite a few times since I found out about it about a month ago. My only complaint is the customer service. There's one woman, bless her heart, who seems to be doing all the work. The other men that work there seem very loud and somewhat profane. A little distracting. The shop is kind of small, but they make excellent use of the space. And again the food is excellent. I suggest the Gang Pang Chicken or beef."}
{"text":"The dude on the phone is annoying as hell. They don't have a hold function for thier phones. You will hear this guy talking sh*t about other customers or he is telling stories about his friends.  He is a complete tool. The food is average.  The best thing they have are their spring rolls. It sometimes takes 15 minutes to order but this is the only decent chinese delivery in the hood.  WIll someone punch the guy that answers the phone?"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for helping us find dinner tonight!  We are staying at a friend's apartment in Tempe and don't really know the area in terms of places with good food that deliver.  New China Gate definitely qualifies.  We ordered a ton of food so we could eat family style.  We had the sesame beef (flavorful and crunchy), orange chicken (spicy and tender), pork fried rice (fresh and tasty) and kung pao shrimp (shrimp were cooked perfectly and lots of chunky vegetables).  We also ordered three spring rolls which were gigantic.  They looked more like mini burritos than the typical spring roll.  They were good as well with fresh veg, shrimp and chicken as the stuffing. The total was 48 bucks, which is well worth it considering we'll have left overs for days.  Service was friendly and prompt.  They quoted us a 40 minute wait and food was here in 20 minutes.  Another nice touch were the supplies for take out (sauce packets, plastic ware, fortune cookies, etc) that were packed individually in ziploc bags.  We'd definitely recommend New China Gate for delivery and are curious to eat in at their restaurant."}
{"text":"I love New China Gate! I don't get an MSG headache and the Hot and Sour soup is bomb.com I love all my dishes super spicy and my bf likes his mild and they always accommodate. We order delivery about once a week and it always comes piping hot and on time. The over the phone ordering process is a breeze and they bring the card machine to your door. Boom."}
{"text":"We order from this place a lot for lunch.   Generally never had a problem until today. We ordered delivery and no one came so after one hour called and was told he is here now which he was not.  We asked for fresh made lunches and we will pick up and we did but the lunches were not made fresh because they were not hot and also contained a lot of moisture in the carton"}
{"text":"I gave it a one because I couldn't give it anything less. I think their food is just OK. It's a step above PF Changs with a lower price. The reason I will NEVER return to this place again is because of their bartender Robbie. I dined in with my 3 kids and was very disgusted at how loud, vulgur and obnoxious he is. He doesn't seem to care who's around and neither do the rest of the employees. They all seem so non chalant about his behavior. I know exactly what other reviewers are talking about here when they place an order. I witnessed him telling them to hold and continue his conversation with the people at the bar. I will NEVER EVER return to this place again."}
{"text":"I really like the hot and sour soup and the crab puffs.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it's the best Chinese in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"20+ year customer who won't ever be back. Ordered carry out tonight, asked for pea pods to be added to a dish, and was informed they no longer carry pea pods. Upon pick up, the nice clerk was making conversation and I informed her that we were unhappy with the unavailability of pea pods in a Chinese restaurant. She said their supplier had raised their prices. I told her I'm not sure its right to call yourself a chinese restaurant if you stopped preparing chinese dishes with traditional igredients.  The guy who appeared to be the manager went onto explain about it costing too much and the spoilage was too great. I told him that blaming the supplier on pricing (I never asked the cost and would have paid whatever they charged -- within reason) was strange and that there are better and creative ways of managing inventory, and he just smirked at me. On our way out the door, to our backs he said \"I've been at this 20 years and have been doing pretty well.\"  I let it go, but this guy is a jerk and we will never be back here again. BTW, the place was almost empty at dinnertime."}
{"text":"My favorite local Chinese restaurant!  I love the food and the bartender Rob is great!  I take my friends there because it is such a friendly environment...  The egg rolls are amazing and fried rice is off the chain good!   Well really all the food is!  If your in Tempe go there! You will not be disappointed...the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and decided to order delivery... 

Ordered both Thursday lunch specials of sesame chicken and orange beef, both over-dredged in flour then deep fried! Both were very salty. Do NOT trust the other reviews!!! This place is NOT tasty!! 

I'm sad to say that Panda express might be better :("}
{"text":"Incredible service and excellent food. I went in to have lunch last weekend and was extremely impressed. The waitress was very friendly, and did a great job taking care of us. I never had to ask for a refill, as she was always on top of it. The food was delicious, and came quickly despite it being very busy. The restaurant was very clean, and the atmosphere was fun. I will definitely be coming back regularly!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice to try to get takeout. The first time, I waited 15 minutes listening to the bartender and the delivery guy yelling and cursing at each other. Earlier this evening, I stood for 10 minutes without any acknowledgment from anybody. They only seem to care about the people sitting in the 4 barstools. I gave them two chances and two fails. I'll never recommend them to anybody. Ever. BTW, the only reason I gave them 1 star is because the review won't post with at least that."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast and I always have trouble finding decent Chinese. This place is amazing the delivery was a bit long but the food was fresh and delicious. We had the bbq fried rice and also the general tsos chicken.  Both were amazing.  Love this place"}
{"text":"Super yummy food and really friendly service.  Can't beat it in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment, close to home chinese. Thanks fellow yelpers! Tucked into the corner of a shopping center with two small rooms but ample seating for sure. Friendly staff and good food! We started out with an order of hot and sour soup, and order of pot stickers and then I had the Gang Pang chicken, my girl the orange beef. All I can say is the food was really good! Both these dishes seemed alittle extra sweet... I didnt read the menu completely or just didnt remember how my chicken was prepared. Normally I wouldn't order something like this but I did eat it all. There was a party in the other room but we were not bothered in anyway. The bartender was HALARIOUS with a few comments that were directed towards the Suns game! Nothing inappropriate just funny. The staff all seemed to get along great and helped each other. The drink refills were almost too much! LOL!! They were right on it with your water and tea. The only thing that was a bummer was the food was out bam-bam-bam!!! I like to finish my app before my soup comes out and same for my entree.... BUT.... That wont stop me from going back when I need a spot close to home and cant make it out to see my buddy Mr.Wong!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place. We typically order delivery and they are prompt, friendly, and always include plenty of sauces and won ton strips. Our regular order is gang pang chicken, veggie fried rice with extra egg and they throw in some free crab puffs. I crave the crab puffs once a week.We have had several other dishes and they have always been fresh and delicious. If they ever add mu-shu to the menu I'll add a fifth star."}
{"text":"So, I read reviews and thought I would try out their delivery. Just now. Truth be told, I didn't even get to the order. I was put on \"hold.\" (The guy just put his hand over the phone or something...I could here everything.) 

He then answered another call, someone named Brian...remember, I could hear everything. He told Brian that the delivery guy would be there in 2 minutes. After he hung up, he proceeded to complain to a nearby worker about how he can't believe that people call back to ask about the delivery. \"An hour means an hour. Not 43 minutes, not 52.5 minutes, an hour.\" 

As you can imagine between the obvious griping about annoying customers and the clear hour-long wait for delivery I was about to be subjected to. I just hung up. 

The food may be great, but I'm not sticking around that phone call (or clearly irritated employee) to find out."}
{"text":"The outside is a bit of a eye sore, but the food is sooo good. They have a baby bar to order a beer while you wait. The windows open on one side of the restaurant for patio diners to enjoy fresh air. Don't let the exterior change your mind on at least ordering food to go."}
{"text":"We order from here once a month or so, the veggie egg foo yung is to die for - Delivery guy is reasonably quick and is always super nice! I would recommend to anyone looking for a go-to order out chinese spot!"}
{"text":"Fast, affordable, and tasty Chinese food here. It's not necessarily the best Chinese food I've ever eaten but it's good enough that I keep coming back for more. We always go for their dinner combo which includes an entree, rice, soup, crab puff, and an egg roll. At around $10, it's not too shabby of a price and there's always enough food to enjoy leftovers the next day. We like the orange chicken and sesame chicken the best so far!"}
{"text":"The few items I've had on the menu are consistently good. The food is always fresh and finally a Chinese place in Phx that puts broccoli with your food! I don't have many issues with the bartender bc I usually order for pickup on the way home. He's always friendly to me and calls me by name. I could see how his personality could be off putting to some tho, so I suggest some of you who've had less then desirable experiences with him take your food to go. I think the food is worth it.

The other staff members are very pleasant and I always see customers having a good time when I go.  On an earlier visit, they messed up my order (chicken instead of tofu), but fixed it promptly. No problems since."}
{"text":"I ordered this from Postmates and didn't get my complete order. I called the restaurant to see what can be done and the ppl who answered the called were pretty rude, passed the buck to Postmates and then hung up on me. When I called backed, they still had no resolution and was again rude. I will not be ordering or going to this place again. The way ppl are treated speaks volumes of who they are."}
{"text":"Just tried New China Gate for the first time. The people that work here are super friendly! I ordered the cashew chicken and the Gang Pang chicken with fried rice and vegie rolls. The food was so delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing really to say.. Just having a bite before grocery shopping. Some of the staff is super friendly!! ;) Only thing, is I wish they would take orders from a different location. That's pretty distracting. Also, just cause it's cooler out, doesn't mean you should prop door open. If I wanted to eat with flies, I would have ate on the patio."}
{"text":"First of all, crab puffs here are amazing. Always get the combo with your meals, soup, egg roll and crab puff for a dollar extra. Can't beat it. I got the twice cooked pork, bf got the house special Lo mein. Our server was very friendly and super fast. Soup and sides came out fast. Dinner came out when we were finished. Everything was delicious. Great little place. Our total bill was only 27! Can't beat the price for the amount of food and taste!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for real authentic Chinese food. The staff is very friendly and very professional. I love the fact that they are a family owned and ran establishment. I definitely recommend the house fried rice. I don't know what they do to their chicken but it is so moist and delicious. The proportions are very big and fulfilling. I have been there multiple times since my first visit. And never have I been disappointed with the food or the service. And then you also can't beat the $2.50 Heinekens."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, no one orders Chinese delivery for fine dining. You order it because you have no food in your house or are too lazy/drunk/hungover to drive somewhere to get food.

When they screw up your order it truly sucks. New China Gate screwed up my order in several ways, and for the price it's just not worth doing business with them. They did overcooked noodles, spicy when I asked for it not to be spicy, didn't write my address down correctly, & overall mediocre food.

I've ordered from there a few times, & at this point I am done. On to the next Chinese delivery place New China Gate. It was not me, it was you."}
{"text":"Delivery saved the hung over day!!!  Delicious soup. Sweet and sour was delicious and he brought me a sprite for free. Very nice and I feel much better. I'll be getting delivery again soon   YUM. Even my son loved it which earned them the five stars because he doesn't usually care for Chinese."}
{"text":"I can understand why this place may have received a less than perfect rating ... however.  I am going to say, that there is one savior menu item that I will base almost my sole decision to give this place a perfect rating.  The \"Gang Pang Chicken\" is stellar!  Made in the likeness of General Tso's, with a southwest flare, made with fresh jalapeño peppers.  I live in Portland, Oregon now and recently visited Scottsdale.  This was the first place I eagerly went to for a great meal in a friendly relaxed atmosphere.  The reason I mentioned understanding the less than perfect rating, is because I have tried some of their beef and seafood dishes and agree, they do not remotely compare to the Gang Pang Chicken!  The hot and sour soup is great too!  The manager's name is Jason and is a very personable, so give him a shout if you decide to try this place out.  It's a charming 'lil place with funny language barrier misspellings on the menus like \"sparking wine\" [notice there is no L], to possibly lead to a humorous misinterpretation of what is actually being served."}
{"text":"This restaurant had pretty delicious vegetarian Chinese food. We grabbed take out and we tried the vegetable kung pao and the braised tofu entrees. Vegetables were very fresh. I also liked their hot and sour soup which was nice and tangy. I will ask for them to bring the heat a little more next time, the spice level was medium and not really very spicy. Overall good though and the inside of the place looked very clean, friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Small, friendly place with a good atmosphere. Yui Shan Pork was delicious! Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant today and the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the customer service was great! The waitress/bartender was awesome.. 

I usually order beef and broccoli when I try a new Chinese restaurant because I figure you can't get anymore basic then that, but it was really bad.. Not enough seasoning and too many water chestnuts.. There was no flavor to the sauce.. And the beef didn't even resemble beef anymore.. The consistency was slimy and weird. 
I would not recommend this place.
Oh and it wasn't cheap for the quality I received!"}
{"text":"Low quality Chinese food. Every chicken dish looked the same- fried balls of meat. Soggy vegetables. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's really small but has great food. You get a lot for a good price. I always have leftovers! Recommend!!"}
{"text":"My review is very split for this place. Food is pretty damn good, but the service and staff are very interesting. The bartender is a nice guy, but super weird and loud and yelling profanities all the time.  We never stay here for dinner. We always order take out and eat at home. It you're looking for some great Chinese take out, this place is great. But don't bring your kids in for a sit down."}
{"text":"Good food, Atmosphere and great Bartender (Robbie). 
Highly recommend this place. Have never been disappointed with service or food. 

Mike and Tonya"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here, as it was located close to my (new) apartment.

The first thing you'll note going in, is it's a storefront restaurant. My expectations were rather low, but it was convenient, and it was Chinese food, always a plus. 

Entering, my hopes lifted a bit. The restaurant has a full bar, in front of which are one set of tables, then a glass separator, with a door leading to open air patio style seating. Nice, breeze atmosphere, despite the locale. \"Have a seat anywhere\" said the manager. 

I chose to sit out in the open air patio area. The view isn't that great; just part of the parking lot and the shops, but the weather was nice. The waitress was by almost immediately with a glass of water and a menu. The lunch combinations were all priced well; I was ready to order almost immediately, getting the Gang Pang Chicken (not in response to Mark B's review, but on my own initiative. I always find it safest to order chicken in Chinese restaurants; beef and pork I find are more easily under or over cooked; chicken for some reason tends to come out right more often than not). 

The food arrived in a cute little compartmentalized serving tray; a small salad in one compartment, an egg roll in another, a crab puff in another, a selection of sweet and sour sauce and horseradish mustard in another, rice in another, and lastly the entry. Kudos on presentation.

The entry was quite good, though I'm not as big a fan of General Tso's style dishes (again, with a nod toward Mark B.), and the description had led me to believe I'd be getting more vegetables in it (that's a problem I have with all Chinese restaurants). Definitely worth ordering if you like that style of thing though. The salad was okay, mostly lettuce, with a sweet dressing and wonton noodles on it. The egg roll was subpar, and the crab puff was, as noted by Heather C, mostly cream cheese, little crab.

All in all though, I left feeling -extremely- full, and with my wallet barely lighter. Not including tip, my meal, plus a coke, was under $9. If you're looking for a good, quick Chinese place, and happen to be in the area, this is not a bad choice at all. Definitely worth a go."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff!
My wife and I have been looking for a great place to get Chinese and we think we've found our spot. They really do put \"love\" in their food!!!"}
{"text":"Very rude!... I sat here for ten minutes and was ignored by one of the servers who seemed to help everyone else.  I don't know if the food is good here but I'll never come back again.. Totally unacceptable at any restaurant"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever. I've been ordering from here for years and the quality is always great! The food tastes amazing :)

LOVE iT!"}
{"text":"Can you give less than one star? I called on a friday night for delivery and the guy told me right away they were done delivering even though the website said they still had an hour left. He asked me to hold, but i could hear everything he was saying in the background. He was joking with his friends. Very unprofessional. When i went to pick up my food, the bar was covered in trash and dirty plates. The bar tender was taking shots and swearing up and down about how much he hated his job. I just about walked out when he started to ask me why i wasnt smiling over and over. His friends were hitting on me while i waited for my food. This place was disgusting and should be shut down for so many reasons. I will never return to this p"}
{"text":"The other day I was craving some Chinese food, but didn't want to drive and get it so I found China Gate online. I ordered the Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken. Since my order was over $20 they threw in some free crab puffs. It ended up being around $23 before tip which was a little more than I had originally planned, but oh well. It took about 50 minutes to be delivered, which was a bit longer than I expected, but the food was great. The crab puffs were delicious and the Mongolian Beef was great with the crispy rice that came underneath. I saved the Sweet and Sour Chicken for the next day, which was still good, but probably not as good as it would have been sans microwave. I will definitely be ordering from China Gate next time I need my Chinese food kick."}
{"text":"The order started off rough, but ended up taking a turn for the better.  When I called to order food for delivery, it was obvious that they were busy. I was put on hold several times and it actually took over 10 minutes to place the order. I wasn't sure how to take this. Are they so busy because the food is great? Or, are they going to screw up or lose my order because they are so busy?  The food arrived about 20 minutes after they said it would but it was still hot, made correctly and very good. I wouldn't say it's the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it's a solid 4 for takeout, price and portion size. They also through in some crab puffs, which my Bf said were very good.  I'll give them a pass for the service and delivery, because I could tell they were really busy. I hope the next time we order we get a little better experience on the service side."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place!  I've been looking for a good take out place near my home for 2 years now and this will definitely be the one.  I tried 3 different dishes and while there may have been a bit too much green onion or breading here and there, the quality and taste of these dishes are the best I've found in Scottsdale so far.  Even after 4 days of reheating and eating portions of my dinner I still thought it tasted good.  If that tells you anything..  The dishes I got btw were mongolian beef, sweet and sour pork and some kinda panfried fat noodle with everything on top thing.

Prices were a bit on the high side I thought (about 10 avg per dish whether its fried rice, noodle or beef), but I'd rather have this than Panda Express the next time I want Chinese!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here for delivery tonight.  It wasn't good.  I ordered the Egg Drop soup, crab puffs, sweet and sour pork, and my boyfriend got the house special pan-fried noodles.  

First thing was that there was sauce of some kind all over in the bag, it got onto everything and soaked through our box of rice. We couldn't figure out where the sauce had come from. I opened my sweet and sour pork to see that there was no sweet and sour sauce in the food.  There was a thin layer at the bottom but that was it, the rest was dry. 

The Egg Drop soup, which I had assumed would be exactly that, seems to be made with whatever they have lying around at the time they make the soup. Mine had tofu and tomatoes in it and I could taste chicken for some reason.  When I order egg drop soup I definitely do not want other stuff in it, I only want the egg drop... Upon second look at the menu, it says that the egg drop soup contains 'varied ingredients'.  That is very unsettling to me. 

The crab puffs are okay... nothing special.  The wontons used to make them are greasy and kind of chalky to me, and they weren't warm at all when we got them. 

My boyfriend's dinner wasn't that good either... it tasted like they drenched everything in soy sauce... he said that he couldn't taste anything else but the sauce and it was very disappointing.  The only thing they did right was the steamed rice. 

Long story short, I'm NEVER ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised to learn that there is a Chinese place 5mins away from where I live! Even more surprising was how good the food is! We had chicken and pork fried rice, Chicken Lo Mein and Pork dumpling. For the price, It was all worth it. The servings were big. good to split with 5 people. It's very chill when you get inside. Not bad to give this place a try. Looking forward to ordering more in the future."}
{"text":"I was trying to find a place that served War Su Gai like I remember from growing up in Seatlle, and this is the only place I've had that comes close. It's a great little restaurant with a small bar and a friendly owner that manages to make me happy every time I go. They have a great lunch special that has tons of food for $6.50. A great cheap option for surprisingly good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Ambiance was fun.  Tiny little main room and the bar dominates it.  The bartender was offering up free shots to the dining room of his own concoction (Scooby Snacks) and was just very social with the patrons, addressing them by first name.

The food was good.  I had a vegetables and tofu dish.  The tofu was disgusting.  However, the vegetables and sauce were delicious enough that I just picked out the tofu and that was good enough for me.

I had a beer and hot sake for the low price of $3.99.  My dinner with the food, alcohol, tax and tip was $16.  Not cheap but not that bad either."}
{"text":"Well I usually love this place and tell everyone about it but tonight changed it all.
Called to have delivery was on hold forever then she hung up on me (that should have been my first clue) then when I called back she tried to do it again and was trying to talk me into delivery even though I was fine with hour delivery 
Ordered food which was a task, she was so rude.
Once food arrived order was wrong. I thought maybe given wrong order but no i called to say someone else's order might be wrong but she just wrote it down wrong. Then she said oh well ok it's fine then? If it was something ok I would have been fine I asked if I could either get right order or money back. She just keep talking about a credit and didn't even take info down to do that just my first name. No last name. Very disappointed  guess time to fine a new place"}
{"text":"Best Chinese found so far in our quest to find our New Goto for Chinese. Prices were higher than I was expecting but average for the area and the Quality and Quantity are So Worth it. The two of us dined and we have leftovers for Supper. The serving is Family style and Very Enjoyable. The General Tso and Sesame Chicken are crisp and Delicious."}
{"text":"My family loves Chinese food- it is our #1 pick every time when ordering in, so when our favorite place closed down we were on the hunt to look for comparable Chinese food. Unfortunately, this is the best we can find for delivery. 

It is decent for Chinese food, good portions, reasonably priced, and quick delivery. But, I wouldn't give it more than 3 stars. 

I read other reviews of this place and 1 person made a comment that the orange chicken tasted similar to another dish. I too have found this to be the case with a lot of dishes ordered. If you order more than 1 saucy chicken dish, chances are they will taste the same with only a slight difference. 

The wontons are ok, sometimes a little greasy, but you get them for free when you order delivery. Most of the time the dog ends up eating them. 

If you aren't picky about a variety of flavor this is your place. If you are in the S. Scottsdale area and you want decent Chinese food delivered this is the place to go. But, if you are looking for more authentic Chinese food I would try the buffet on Scottsdale Rd and McDowell."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for take out and delivery. I've not eaten at the actual restaurant so I can't comment on that. I love the hot and sour soup, and I've been pleased with every beef and chicken entree I've ordered. Not fancy, not pretentious. Good, reasonably priced and fast."}
{"text":"I was on my to work yesterday and I summond my favorite woman(next to my wife) as i gently pushed her talk switch and said NEAREST CHINESE RESTAURANT she came up with new china gate i pulled in the parking lot and tucked way in the back corner was the restaurant. always a little sceptical i entered the restaurant ...clean,friendly staff and patrons sitting having lunch i ordered the lunch special tsos chicken served w/fried rice green salad and egg roll all very tasty great spot..................."}
{"text":"I honestly think this place might have some of the best food in the East Valley. I always order the General Tso chicken and its always SOO good. I recently tried out the Gang Pang chicken and its really delicious. However, I'm not a fan of their lo-mein at all. Oh, and they have fast service, delivery or pickup."}
{"text":"Upon hearing about Facebook postings concerning the  bartender that has worked here for over 7 years I decided to take some action. This guy is an idiot who is always trying to impress the entire little restauant with his drinks he makes up. Being a small place everyone has to listen while he rants about his skills. 
THE WARNING HERE IS HE SERVES  MINORS ON PURPOSE! He seems to cater to the younger crowd....under 21! Kinda creepy!
I WATCHED AS A COUPLE OF YOUNGER GUYS WALKED IN AND WERE NOT CARDED BUT INSTEAD GIVEN SAMPLES OF THESE \"SPECIAL\" DRINKS.

It is ashame because the food is good both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to Chinese food place when I live in Tempe. I never ordered delivery -- I think I lived too far from the restaurant -- but I've dined in and ordered take-out many, many times. I moved to North Scottsdale a few years back and forgot about New China Gate until I randomly started craving it a few days ago. I caved and went back tonight and all the good and bad memories came rushing back. 

As others have stated, the main guy -- Robbie -- is really annoying and nice at the same time. He just takes it a few levels too far. I was just in there tonight and he was going on and on to my boyfriend and I about how he wanted to hook up with some 22-year-old girl who was just in the restaurant celebrating her friend's birthday. (Uhhh....ok? I'm flattered that you feel so open around me to discuss such topics?) He straight up asked us if that was weird that he, \"a 37 year-old wanted to hook up with a 22-year-old.\" My boyfriend and I politely laughed but it was super creepy and weird. I don't really care about professionalism since it's just not that kind of place but please keep your creeper thoughts to non-dining guests. As we left, Robbie told another couple who sat down the same story about the girl and how hot she was. Exactly.

The food here is pretty good and the servers are really nice. Too bad for them Robbie dominates the restaurant.  I've ordered the General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Beef Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour Chicken: all pretty good, a bit above PF Changs.

I actually won't come back here anymore. The place feels more like a dive bar that serves food that a Chinese restaurant -- all thanks to the glorious Robbie.

Take-out/Delivery at your own risk. 

Robbie -- if you're listening -- stop being so annoying."}
{"text":"There are so many restaurants in Scottsdale it's sometimes very hard to return to the same place twice!

But I think I have a new favorite!!!!

The food at China Gate is remarkable!!! Crisp, Hot, Fresh Tasty, and Satisfying. I especially love the shrimp dishes, and tonight's Lo Mein was fantastic. The house special fried rice was outstanding. I loved that hot tea was ready, served hot and just 50 cents with a refill. 

Service the last few times was humble, congenial, and efficient.  

I must say that I have eaten at the New China Gate a half dozen times but it's been years and now twice in a month. I am already craving the food again.

Unless you are in Southern Mesa, great Chinese food is hard to come by, but there you have it. Give them a try because I know the quality is outstanding!!!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place across the parking lot as I was going to the market.  Decided to order take out and was pleasantly surprised.  The host/waiter was very chatty, really chatty.
Ordered Pork Fried Rice.  Would go back or recommend."}
{"text":"The food quality, portions and the service was excellent.  They served me ice water and hot tea immediately. The place seemed very clean."}
{"text":"Great food (no MSG!)... Apps..soups.....entrees... always well flavoured and well-seasoned... We often stop in here after work, when the trek to Mr. Wong's in Peoria is too far. Luckily they keep great late hours. The staff is always positive and entertaining.
It appears they keep busy with takeout orders, crafty concoctions at the bar, and a steady locals crowd that dines-in. Check it out! Well worth the time."}
{"text":"Ate here for a birthday get-together with a fairly large group of people.

The food was really well-prepared and presented rather nicely.  I had the Sweet and Sour Pork.  The prices for dinner seemed a bit high, so thankfully we had arrived before 4 and qualified for lunch specials all around.

Everyone enjoyed their meal and there was not much of a crowd so we got to calmly talk and open gifts at our table.

Nice experience and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Dirty plates, glasses, and silverware.  Shrimp still had shit in them, things tasted old.  Try someplace else."}
{"text":"After the good review of the Gang Pang Chicken, I decided to give it a try.  It was actually pretty bad.  It consisted of a brown sauce with jalapeños and chunks of deep fried, dried out chicken.  At a rate of $10 for that, I won't be returning anytime soon.  The guy that other reviews have spoken of was present and their depiction of him as a bit annoy and inappropriate are spot on.  I'm all about the occasional banter but don't intentionally hold up the payment process so you can makes some unfunny jokes and discuss across the restaurant where you're going drinking tonight."}
{"text":"When I get a craving for Chinese, I get take out from New China Gate.   Its close by, delivery is quick and the food is consistently delish.  I've only ever been inside for pickup, but its clean and the people are friendly.

Cant eve4r go wrong with the wonton soup, crab wontons moo goo gai pan.  Feeling devilsih?  Try the gang pang chicken.  I've never tried it but I swear its on the menu and gets me thinking every time."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  Typical Americanized Chinese food in a strip mall.  I'm okay with that.  I do live in America after all.

I had crab puffs, I didn't taste the crab, only cream cheese, but good none the less.  Potstickers were in a more \"doughy\" wrap than I'm used to, but they were okay.  I also had cashew chicken.  Loved it that they didn't skip on the cashews, but the sauce was too thick for my taste-like a gravy consistency.

Service was good and prices are reasonable.  Restaurant is small, but clean.  They deliver as well.  I may go back."}
{"text":"So, let me first say part of the two star rating is for the fact that the food was pretty good. My friends and I got a couple dishes and a soup and I liked it. But, the food does not make up for the man who was running the joint. Whomever is the lanky bald headed asshole who was taking orders  needs to be fired! I don't know what was worse the fact that he was mocking Asian accents or that he was yelling at customers when taking to go orders. When my friend and I walked in he was making really rude jokes towards people who are Asian saying things like \"Two dolla\" \"Herro\" and other offensive statements. I'm not one for the extreme politically correct but it got worse. An apparent older woman called in to make an order and instead of being patient the man started yelling at her \"How many times have you ordered?! Why don't you know the menu?!\" Then placed the lady on hold and started yelling how she was \"pilled out.\" The whole time he kept doing this he was claiming the restaurant was so busy when there was only two other tables in the restaurant. The whole experience was rather awkward, I know food service can be stressful but not to the point where you need to insult people. I won't be coming here again. I felt bad for the other servers, they seemed embarrassed."}
{"text":"It's tasty and reasonably priced. We order delivery quite often and haven't been disappointed (except when we're starving and it takes 45 min+ for delivery but that's standard and our fault ). It's a cute little restaurant too."}
{"text":"Tried to have lunch here but the service here wasn't great. We had to ask for water after ten minutes of waiting. Told the gentleman we were ready to order and was referred to another lady who seen us sitting there for ten minutes and decided to help people who arrived after us. We just got up and left and went to Tottie's instead."}
{"text":"my roommate and I were trying to decide where to eat for forever and just got in the car and drove to the closest and we end up here. First off, absolutely loved everyone who worked there. We ordered our food, I got shrimp lo mein - loved it! and he got the orange chicken and loved it as well. While we waited for our food we just talked with a man I assume is an owner or manager (I forgot to get his name) he was so fun I loved it. The girl working the register said \"a must\" when we ordered the crab puffs, sooooo good too. Great experience and great food! Will be back 100%"}
{"text":"Went to order some sweet and sour chicken. Came out in like 4 minutes ready to go. SUPER FAST!

The chicken... it tasted all right. Too much breaded dough. And I feel the sauce tasted a little spicy. But overall decent if you don't care about Chinese food as much as I do. It satisfies if you are in a hurry. I will have to try the other dishes but the sweet and sour chicken is the same that you would find elsewhere for American appetites."}
{"text":"The food is good. The portions are huge so my husband and I share. This is a friendly place! It's reasonable so it doesn't break the bank. It must be time for a visit!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Chinese restaurants that I have found in the area. The servers are very good and quick, and the food comes out quickly,  My one complaint is the bartender is very loud and talks a lot! I can hear him more loud and clear than the people I am eating with. I like to try to get a seat in the indoor patio area just so it is a little quieter. The time I couldn't sit out there, at one point I was actually raising my voice just so the person at my own table could hear me. As a result, I think this would be an excellent place for take out."}
{"text":"Hey Ashley G. Wow, I had the same problem I've been to the New China Gate several times because the food is okay but because of the bartender it's just not worth it!  This guy is so obnoxiously loud, I could not hear the person across from me because he was so loud.  When I mentioned this too him the delivery person jumped in to defend him saying \"Are you from here, we are locals\" which was really weird and a strange comment.  I decided to try again and go eat at the place but he was really loud again so I talked with the manager who said, \"he's worked at the restaurant a long time so it's okay he's loud\" and the manager did not seem to mind that a customer was telling him about a problem or that the employee was too loud it was the strangest response.

The people and management at the New China Gate don't have a clue about customer service; so if all you care about is the food it's an okay place to go but I don't think you're going to enjoy yourself because of the noise and the bartender."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh, crisp and perfectly seasoned with friendly service. If you have a cold or allergies, nothing - not even grandmas chicken soup beats their hot and sour soup. It's perfect. I'm also hung up on their dragon and phoenix (dinner only) which is served in a light sauce that I would find boring anywhere else but here. I've tried bites of other dishes, their sweet and sour was surprisingly good. 

Delivery has been fast with everything still hot and crisp. When I have eaten inside, it's been pleasant and relaxing with a nice selection of brews to choose from. This is a small place with only about 10 tables and a counter so service is very personable. It's a good atmosphere for lingering into long conversations when they aren't busy. I think this is one of the South Scottsdale area's hidden gems. I can't think of anything negative."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great Asian cuisine! We go here a lot . They even have a casual bar. I have never received a bad dish from here. I recommend this place to people all the time! Local favorite!"}
{"text":"Awesome place small but the service was first class and generals chicken was great. Prices were very good and will be a regular stop."}
{"text":"We were craving Chinese tonight so of course I hopped on Yelp to do my research. This place was by far the closest to our house and once I read a majority of the reviews I had to go. Everyone was mentioning the bartender who was super loud, obnoxious, and as one review put it, \"certainly on breaking bad's blue meth\". I absolutely had to check it out. Worst case we get a mediocre meal with an annoying bartender.
And that, is pretty much exactly what happened. Food was okay, we got mongolian beef and orange chicken. Hard to screw those up. The place is tiny and could be a cozy setting but...Robby. Oh Robby. Do you read these reviews? You are suuuper friendly and nice (at least we thought so) but please dont talk about inappropriate escapades and how wasted you got last night, while simultaneously downing a shot with a patron. Everyone in the restaurant can hear you. I am baffled at how he is still employed after all of these reviews and, assumingly, a decent number of complaints.
If you want \"meh\" Chinese food that doesnt hurt your wallet, and a free comedy show, go here."}
{"text":"China Gate is the ONLY good Chinese place in Scottsdale. A little pricey but it's such good take out. I eat here at least once a month!! Crab puffs are good, soups are good, chicken meals have been good! The lo mein noodles probably aren't worth their price because you don't get as much and they taste really salty to me. But everything else is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, food was ok except for the seafood dishes were great, maybe they should by there meats somewhere else I preferred a better texture. Still soups , appetizers& seafood anything but beef- I won't waste my money on trying the chicken or pork"}
{"text":"Ordered:

Beef w/ Broccoli: 3/5 - well cooked, but a little bland. I like a bit more flavor and have beennspoiled by NYC Chinese.

Seafood Wonton/Eggdrop cross: 4/5 - burnt egg not so bueno, but other than that? Very nice. Only two shrimp and one wanton in a large one... The flavor was lovely, nice vegetable content... I can forgive the short comings.

Chicken Lo-Mein: 5/5 - Woooooooow drool!!!!

General Tso's Chicken: 4.5/5 - Very small portion for the price but Taste? 5/5. Holy wow.

Crab \"Puffs\"/rangoon: 3/5 - they were free because the order was over $30, but these were basically fried creamcheese no crab to be found. Can't really complain about free food though

Service: 5/5 - GREAT service! Guy was funny as Hell on the phone

Delivery: 5/5 Super super speedy!


over all? 4/5 would definitely order from again :) No witticism for take out today."}
{"text":"This is probably the best delivery Chinese food I've had. They gave me so much chicken for my orange chicken! Also the fried dumplings and the cream cheese crab puffs were great! The pricing was great too! I would order here again."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times as we live in the neighborhood.  Food has always been good but as someone has pointed out, customer service may be lacking.  I went to pick up an order a few minutes ago and it started off pleasant enough.  A female employee sees the delivery driver outside and starts going off and suddenly the customer (me) is invisible.  Apparently he picked up an order of pot stickers from the kitchen and delivered them to someone that didn't order them.  That's all she was focused on was him going back to wherever he delivered them and getting her $8.95.  She's trying to ring up my order as she's ripping him a new one, without even telling me how much my order is, she runs my card and hands me my food and continues ranting.  About this time the bartender comes in and sees what's going and and tells the delivery driver not to worry, the bartender will comp the charge.   Since I\"m still not being addressed, I take my food and walk to the door.  Finally, as I'm opening the door someone finally acknowledges that they actually had a customer and says \"thank you\".   Good grief Lady, mistakes happen,  $8.95 isn't worth alienating your customer over and you sure as heck don't talk that way to your employees in front of the customers."}
{"text":"A great place! and amazing food!
Sorry about today and thank you for your delivery!"}
{"text":"This could have been the worst Chinese food I've ever had.   We had a large order, the only item some, not all, of us liked was the broccoli beef.... We called in our order, it was to be ready in 15 minutes.  Wishful thinking. It took approx 45 min so we sat there for at least a half hour.  Lastly, and more irritating, when we got home and unloaded our styrofoam containers, every one of them had leaked!  A huge mess! I think our order required 5 or 6 to go bags, and every single one of them was a sticky, soggy mess - as was the bottom of the containers.  Which of course we didn't notice until we put them on the counter.  The sweet and sour sauce was a very thin, runny, sticky mess.  Same with the broccoli beef sauce, the cashew chicken sauce, the mixed vegetable sauce, their specialty chicken dish (forget what it's called)... 
Yelp rates it with 3.5 stars so maybe this was an off night for them, but if I were a local, I would not go back......"}
{"text":"I recommend this place. Service is good food is great. It's not high scale/high class.. the place is run down BUT it's clean and the food is yummy"}
{"text":"Ordered a ton of food, problem is that if you want variety the cost does add up. Guy made me yell my order like 100 times but it got here in a timely manner and was delicious"}
{"text":"Orange chicken with Fried rice was good. Gang Pang beef was not large enough pieces of beef. But at 11pm it's a great late night place."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Typically order delivery and it arrives in reasonable time, every time.  Robbie (sp?), was very polite and friendly.  Even hooked me up with a free set of spring rolls for delivery, nice surprise.  Portions are always very adequate, enough for two meals.  Maybe one of these days we'll eat in to check out the place.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Good service, read a couple of old bad reviews but tried it anyway. They do some dishes without breading the meat if you ask. Orange beef is good, and surprisingly, my wife liked the mandarin almond chicken. It's really difficult to find good Chinese...this place is not really an exception...however, not too many options in the area."}
{"text":"We have been searching for a go-to Chinese in the neighborhood and this is the place! Always great service and we haven't had a dish that isn't delicious. Especially love the Szechwan spicy beef and the crab puffs! Glad we tried New China Gate!"}
{"text":"The food is actually decent. The problem is the bartender. I went here with my mom for dinner and felt harassed by him for most of our meal. All the time we were minding our own business, he verbally antagonized us from behind the bar. Then he went outside in front of the restaurant to meet with some shady looking guy. Definitely looked suspect. Even though, I would like to go back here for a meal, I just don't think I could stand having him service me."}
{"text":"Delicious food! The egg drop soup hugged my soul!! The orange chicken, low mein and pork fried rice was so delicious as well. Big enough for me and my boyfriend to share! Also cant beat 2.50 beer! Such kind and attentive service! Its a gem, well definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband & I have been frequenting New China Gate 1-2 times/week since we moved to AZ. The food is excellent, the portions are well-sized & the service is wonderful. With that being said, the restaurant manager & bartender, Robbie, is why we will go to New China Gate forever. Robbie is the most caring guy you could ever meet & who always makes my husband & I roar with laughter each time we're there. Robbie IS New China Gate. He LOVES people & you can feel it. You meet Robbie once & he remembers your name (everybody's name, literally) forever. He reaches out to you to make you feel so welcome. He is genuinely interested in you as a person & NEVER forgets anything you've shared with him. I read a few negative reviews on here about Robbie & I feel I must speak up. I will say this-Robbie would never ever \"make fun\" of anyone, or be \"inappropriate\" to anyone in any manner. The people who wrote those few negative comments about Robbie here DON'T know Robbie & have taken his kind humor & warmth completely out of context. If you can't sit back, relax & enjoy a good laugh, go to a restaurant where it's dead quiet! If you want a truly enjoyable dining experience- excellent food & wonderful company with Robbie welcoming you- go to New China Gate, because you will find a welcoming home away from home between the food & Robbie's warmth, humor & care."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food hands down. Very personable staff. Generous portions and affordable prices. It is not a beauty to look at but it's clean. The tables are mostly booths and the decor could be updated - I have to say, it's a great place to go when you want a quick meal."}
{"text":"While on our short stay in Tempe, my boyfriend and I decided to find some good Chinese take out.  This was for sure good. 

We had the war su gai, the wonton soup, fried rice and the happy family.  It was more than enough food and really good for that matter.  They even threw in some steamed rice to boot.  

I'll have to keep my eyes open around my area for a place similar.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Simple and mild Chinese food. We got recommended from our neighbors who are from New Jersey. Call to place an order and the food are ready fast."}
{"text":"I have been here before. It's close to ASU Skysong. It reminds me of NJ mall Chinese food. That is okay, it is a piece of my childhood and I love the sticky sauce and fried dumplings. The lo mien here is most NYish I have had in this area. The issue I have had with the place is the annoying bartender who is usually here. He is loud, ignores customers, and speaks to his buddies who sit at the bar and make it difficult to speak to your guests. UNless you sit in the patio, further away. And you who have been here do not hold back. This is the single bad thing I will say about this place. It is affordable, the service is fine. And they have $1.99 Heineken. All day every day. But don't say I didn't warn you about him. YOu will not hear me say a word about anyone but this requires mention. So go, sit on patio, eat your awesome food and whisper to each other, \"Oh my, it is preety bad...\""}
{"text":"The walnut Coco chicken is addictive and delicious. Fried bits covered in a sweet coconut sauce with plenty of broccoli. 

Everything thing else is forgettable."}
{"text":"I moved to the area a month ago, and have finally found *my* Chinese place.

I ordered takeout tonight, and they forgot to give me my hot and sour soup with my meal. After I called them, they ran my soup over to me and apologized profusely. One point, New China Gate.

The soup was worth it, too. Some Chinese places skimp on the hot and sour, but not this one. No cheap button mushroom crap here. Real tofu, wood ear and cloud mushrooms, and... what's that? LITTLE SHRIMPS? I feel duly spoiled. Point two.

The Hunan chicken was good too. Not too spicy, with a nice assortment of fresh (not over-cooked) vegetables: carrots, broccoli, water chestnuts, etc. Point three.

Finally, the staff was so nice about the whole soup thing that I'll definitely be coming back. Points four and five. A++, New China Gate. Will do business with again."}
{"text":"A tiny little Chinese restaurant hidden away in an easily overlooked shopping center in South Scottsdale. If you don't live around here, you probably wouldn't know it exists. But you won't go wrong if you decide to have food from here. 

New China Gate is a pleasant little place, with very friendly people running it. It's been a while since I've dined in, but every time my friends and I have eaten there it's been a lot of fun. While the food isn't really any better or worse than a typical small Chinese restaurant. The drinks are cheap ($4.00 Sake Bombers!), and the manager and servers treat you very well. 

Take out and delivery are also pretty fast. Needing to pick up a couple of things from the Fry's next door, we ordered take out from here a couple nights ago. The person who took my order said it would be just 15 minutes. I arrived in a little less than that, and our food was already waiting for us. We had the Coco Chicken, which is something I wouldn't order on a regular basis, but I enjoyed. It's breaded chicken with almonds and a thick honey sauce. We also had the Chicken Lo Mien, which was also good. 

While it's not a place I'd head out of my way for, I think anyone who lives around Hayden and McDowell with a craving for Chinese should skip the big chains, and enjoy this little local place."}
{"text":"Okay..... so the only reason this place didn't my full 5 stars is because we weren't even half way done eating, which was very apparent our waitress comes and grabs my coworkers card off table and said to pay now. My coworker says no I'm paying with cash slowly grabbing her card back.. she asked if they were separate we said yes. She asks who had what like it wasn't just us and just two dishes. She then brings us our change with no receipts. She asked if I really needed one and then gave me this.. the food was excellent, customer service not so much. If we have TWO orders we should receive how many receipts? I don't even know what a kitchen check is.. but again, good food."}
{"text":"First visit here, I like that the lunch comes similar to a bento box so you can have a little bit of everything. Spring roll and crab puff was delicious. Entree and rice was average. Server was very pleasant and helpful. Small restaurant, not fancy but the bill was only $8.50 with a soda. You can't even go to a fast food restaurant for less!"}
{"text":"We love ordering in from China gate.The food always arrives in 30-40 minutes on the higher side.They have never had my order wrong or missed even the smallest of things.
The Lo Mein noodles my favorite are soft noodles tossed with choice of protein and vegetables.
Gang pang chicken(Stir-fried battered chicken with spicy hot peppers and green onions) is another dish you have to taste to believe.
Crab puffs (deep-fried puffs filled with crab meat and cream cheese) served with a sweet sauce are good but i cant help crave for a little more crab meat in the filling.
Chicken Corn Soup one word Delicious.

My only disappointment so far has been the chopsuey because in my head it was supposed to be served with crispy noodles(also according to their menu) but it came with Rice.
I did call them but the girl who answered said it has already been delivered so she cannot do anything about it and i should keep in mind that's how they serve it 'WITH RICE'.

I am no expert on Chinese food but i like my chopsuey with crispy noodles Period.
How i wish they had been a little more accommodating since we do order from them quite frequently.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"STILL MY FAVORITE!! :)  

I LOVE this place and all these lame reviews will not stop me from going back.  I usually only get a lunch special to go (cheap by the way).  They have THE BEST orange chicken and KUNG PAO.  I have been trying to find a good Chinese place comparable to China Gate but NO luck.  Every time I eat at any other Chinese places, I always end up saying \"its good, but it's no China Gate\".  This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"wowo this owner is mexican or italian nad he owns a chinese food place........
sobpar at best and the owner/ delivery BOY is mad all the time."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, the service is always great! I usually order the chicken fried rice or kung pao chicken, it's consistent, always good and fresh!"}
{"text":"Very good food, nice and quiet. Very friendly waitress. Was very pleased with my visit."}
{"text":"First time here a couple of weeks ago from several friends recommendations....friendly staff ....Rob the bartender great guy. Got one of our food orders wrong....we called and they said next order on them and I am sure they will back that up....we ate the wrong dish regardless and very good....we will be back !"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food at a price that is a little higher than I would expect for a combo meal. It's good food and the service is reasonably friendly. But, nothing to write home about. I go back all the time because it's in the neighborhood and it's expectable good Chinese food."}
{"text":"We saw some of the other reviews on yelp and decided to give this place a try. We've been looking for Hot and Sour soup, and we sure found a great recipe here. The place is small and part of a strip mall, but it is definitely worth a trip. The food is made fresh and fast, and it is served piping hot. The overall restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly. We ordered crab puffs, hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, chicken lo mein, beef with broccoli (added mushrooms), and the house fried rice. All of it was delicious and I would recommend New China Gate to anyone looking for quality chinese food and great service."}
{"text":"Yummy Gang Bang... I mean Gang Pang chicken! 
Also, they have Cream Cheese Wontons that are to die for! They're off the menu, so you have to ask for them. If you order enough, they may even throw them in for free.

Only downside: their orange chicken tasted like tangy Gang Pang chicken. Next time, I want to try a beef dish!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Delivery always takes forever but when it does arrive, somehow is still hot? AND it's a little on the expensive side. Plus, when you call to order they make you wait 5 minutes so you can listen to employee conversations. 

Annoying process but good food...."}
{"text":"I stopped by to place a large order. I walked into what appeared to be a bar with a Chinese  food side business. 2 people at the bar had obviously been served 1 or 5 too many drinks.  The couple behind the bar never stopped to say hi or can I help you? I picked up a menu and waited to be acknowledged and to place an order. When I gave up, after several minutes, I walked out. As I was walking out the guy behind the bar said, \"Sorry we were ignoring  you\". I ignored them and heard them and the 2 drunks laughing. They lost my $100 order and I hope yours too."}
{"text":"Always good for delivery. Usually pretty quick. Chicken fried rice, orange chicken, beef lo mein and gyoza have always been good."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for convenient Chinese take -out. The food is not gourmet but it satisfies. We usually order curry chicken and mu-shu pork -- both items are not listed on their menus, but they will make it, and ironically, they are two of their better offerings! The restaurant itself is cute, cozy, and has a small outdoor dining area, but it's fairly no frills. We order from here about once a month."}
{"text":"The setting is in your typical strip mall as is all the good places it seems these days.  The place is small and the decor kind of sparse and cheesy Chinese but who cares, the food is what counts.  It was all very good and the prices were very reasonable.  I really enjoyed the General Tso's chicken, just the right amount of smice.  My wife enjoyed her sesame chicken and we both had a fair amount of leftovers for lunch the next day.  Has a small bar where you can get exotic cocktails."}
{"text":"I, honestly, will NEVER go back to this place (& that's sad because I did want to try the Samoan specialty drink there, which, I don't know why they would serve that there being that everyone, besides the Asian Waitress, was white). IDK 

But I really hate when I leave a place feeling used & played. Not only with my monetary but with my dignity & time. My whole experience there was inappropriate, uncomfortable, loud, obnoxious, tense & with some nasty food to top it all off. 
 
We had the shrimp stir fry that had no enhanced flavor, oiling & watery veggies (about 4 lil' carrots & broccoli) that was as bland as the cook (white beach boy looking guy) who was sitting at the bar \"celebrating\" his 33rd birthday with the dishwasher/bartender that everybody is mentioning on here. (He is ridiculous and must be a relative to the owner, Jayson, because if he is not, I really don't know how he is employed in this country with high unemployment rate).  

When we walked in we were greeted by the submissive Asian Lady I feel sorry for to have to be there. (I really wanted to ask her where in the world is her father or some normal non assimilated Asian Male figure at. Because I am POSITIVE that his presents would make a huge difference there). 

The restaurant is too small to be loud. Yelling and cursing like a sports bar. The waitress said it was because apparently \"the game was on\" but according to other reviews here that was as BS as the place. 

The dishwasher/bartender (guess name is Robbie?) was drinking a corona (I guess OK in the state of AZ to drink on the job) but he was also talking about hispanic people and something about skin color with a customer who was talking about the fortune cookie is telling him to learn chinese? (He was passive. yeah, you know what I mean by that. He was as passive as the \"Bartender\"...eating & in a \"ethnic\" establishment loving the ethnic food but taking reckless \"aims\" towards it's people.)

We were going to dine in but after about 10 minutes in this sports bar we decided to get our food to go. 

When we were walking out (just like the other yelper said) weirdo creepo goes, \"have a good night ladies\" being a straight prick because I know that he knows we left because of him (He was even in my conversation from across the room giving his two thoughts?!).

Don't support this place unless you are like them and like to eat our food but don't like taking cheap shots to the people who this food originates to. 

They call this place \"Americanize Chinese\" or use these terms \"Americanize or Modern twist\" but this isn't much of a twist its really a reckless combination that SHOULD NOT be mixed! Bring back original everything, including an Asian or Mexican who culture is this FOOD!"}
{"text":"Our family has been to New China Gate at least 15 times over the last year and a half.  The food is good, but it isn't the food that keeps us coming back;  it is the bartender.  He is the sort of person that you either \"get\" or \"don't get\" but we, and many of our friends who now frequent this establishment because of him definitely \"get\" him.

Robbie, the bartender, is the type of person who remembers your name after the first time you visit.  He takes a genuine interest in how you are doing.  He cares about your family, be you 10 or 50.   He can talk to the adults about sports, language, or history while simultaneously talking to the young kids about their little league games (he used to be a coach). 

I've read reviews here by people who don't understand him, but we, and the many friends we have taken to this establishment appreciate his lighthearted demeanor.  As long as he is there, we will continue to frequent the establishment."}
{"text":"WORST CHINESE FOOD EVER. Been there twice now. First time I was convinced by some of my associates that it was the best Chinese food in town. WRONG. I believe in another first chance, but I was failed both times, just like my ex-wife. We divorced 4 years ago and she acted like she was going get back with me, just to take my kids away.. ANYWAYS the first time I had the orange chicken.. SUCKS. The second time I had the Beijing beef.. TASTE THE SAME BUT BROWN.

I honestly think they use a white cow for the chicken and a chocolate cow for the beef. NO JOKE. Look this up. They recently had an article in the Scottsdale times that accused China Gate of using animal meats from Indonesia that somewhat tasted like beef and chicken. Its just a conspiracy but every conspiracy has a little truth to it..

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME. SERVICE WAS BAD!!!! They only filled up my water once even though I was the only one in the run down, dirty, establishment. IT WAS A HOT DAY TOO!! HOTTEST OF THE YEAR! AROUND 120 DEGREES. I was dying of thirst but  nooooooo dont mind my poor little body, (im 96 pounds and 56 years old, Male)

If anyone reads this, I need help. I am still sick from the china gate I ate last week.. 

Thank you for reading.

Goodbye"}
{"text":"I had delivery, got it hot, and got it the way I wanted it, would have been five stars but they forgot my tea.
I ordered crab puffs, a chicken and shrimp egg roll, and house lo-mein.
The shrimp was perfectly cooked in the lo-mein, the crab puffs were crispy and they didn't scrimp on the cream cheese inside, plenty of sauce to go around.  
I will definitely be ordering from there again"}
{"text":"I've never posted about a chinese place.. Nothining impressive about the environment, but I was only calling to take out. WOW!!

WOW! The food was so great.  I had to re-heat it since I called it in and did takeout...  

Did I say WOW?  What a gem!  I was stuffed and wanted to eat more...  I didn't have to wait an hour to be hungry....  I was a goldfish...  eating until my belly burst...

Again, WOW!!

Do these people really know how good their food is????"}
{"text":"I went on a journey to find carryout Egg Drop soup, my usual spot was closed so I landed here.  The place doesn't look like much from the outside, their lighted sign lights are out, small, but crowded...always a good sign.  Got to say the egg drop soup was good and the spring rolls were great, large and delicious.  A surprise find.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"New China Gate gets so much Chinese food street cred for being open on Christmas day. 

They do deliver, but they typically have to quote a very long time due to their limited staff. Not a problem for me since i live very close, and whenever I stop in, theyre really friendly. 
I've only eaten take out there, never dined in. 
Each time my order has been accurate, quick, & the food the is pretty tasty Chinese for what we have to choose from in the area. 

I keep it pretty simple with egg rolls, lo mein, and rice, and something new each time. So far the spicy kung pao & cashew dishes have held up pretty well. 

I hope they stay around & have some success in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"So, there haven't really ever been any decent Chinese food delivery places in my area.  At least, none that I'm aware of.  I haven't had decent Chinese food since I was last in San Fran.  Until now!

Annnyway, checked out New China Gate based on the two reviews, and the sweet and sour chicken is delicious.  The food is always hot when delivered, and aside from the delivery guys being a little quirky --I've had an overall awesome experience with the place."}
{"text":"My order was quick and easy over the phone, the guy was really nice, and the food was very good. My S&S chicken was perfect and in a nice sized portion. I would definitely come here again; overall great service and food for the price."}
{"text":"This place is preeeety good I must say! I've only ordered their delivery but keep in mind it was so HOT when it was delivered that I burned my mouth on the chicken trying to eat it. Now THAT is impressive.
Originally we decided to order from this place because I was so hungover and just wanted some wor wonton soup, unfortunately they didn't have a wonton soup that was seafood free so I went with other choices.
After reading the reviews my boyfriend and I ordered the gang pang chicken which I will forever remember because it's so similar to gang bang. Anyways. It was pretty good! The breading seemed a little soggy to me, but that could be because of the delivery. The flavor of the sauce was the perfect spicy sweet flavor I wanted. 
But my favorite? THE GARLIC CHICKEN! Why did I not see this being reviewed?! It's so bomb, especially over white rice and I will forever love any Chinese dish that comes with water chestnuts and vegetables. MUST TRY! 
Another dish that was great was the pork chow mein, I mean, it's not as good as the kind I've had in China Town SF, but it's the best I've had in AZ. 
If you order (I believe) 20 dollars or more you get free crab puffs and they are DELICIOUS, like hide from the person you're sharing a meal with kind of good.
What I didn't like....the hot and sour soup. Way too much sour. I scooped the meat pieces out and gave it to the dogs. 


Nonetheless, I'll be coming back. Probably for lunch cause the deals look a lot better than dinner."}
{"text":"Ok, I like New China Gate. I want to like it more, but I don't know...

The guy who is always working here is extremely nice and friendly, but borderline annoying. I would order delivery, unless you want to listen to him talk talk talk talk....non stop. 

The lo mein here is really good. You can tell they use quality ingredients. No mystery meat here.

The free crab puffs with delivery are also so good. You can tell they fry everything in a good quality oil.

Their hot and sour soup is, ok. It's pretty different. It tastes like a beef broth, and its flavored with hot chili's instead of pepper. At first bite I hated it, but now I really like it and always order it. Just be prepared, it's nothing like a traditional hot and sour soup.

The delivery is sometimes super fast, but I have waited an hour and a half once, it's understandable though because they are always super busy, and the nice/annoying guy always warns you if it's going to be a long wait.

All in all, a good place for delivery, wish they were a little cheaper, but great for when you don't want to leave the house."}
{"text":"Good but not great.  The food is consistent just lacks the ? factor that makes you say, Let's have that tonight!  It's standard chinese food fair."}
{"text":"It wasn't my favorite Chinese food and I don't think I will go again. It was a little more fried than anything and really tasted the oil."}
{"text":"Food was good but being the only one in the restaurant the help must of forgot about me as they stood around and talked to each other. I had to ask for a refill on the water and also had to ask for a to go box."}
{"text":"Love the place!!! Chicken lo mien is the best I ever had!!! Also great bartender!! I promise you a great time!!!"}
{"text":"Go for the food and the value, not for the ambiance...

I have been longing for a decent Chinese restaurant close to home. I had driven past New China Gate many times, but it just didn't look like much so I didn't give it much thought. 

Yesterday, really craving Chinese, I finally took time to read reviews about New China Gate from 3 different sources. While there were lots of digs about other aspects of New China Gate, the reviews of the food were generally good. Thank goodness those reviewers were generally specific.

In particular, reviews of their Garlic Chicken intrigued me. My taste was for something not too heavy, and not breaded or fried - but with lots of flavor. The Garlic Chicken reviews made me get in my car and drive to New China Gate.

I arrived around 5:00 unsure what to expect, and concerned that they might be really busy. There were plenty of tables available, and I was invited to sit where I wanted by a very friendly woman who was working there. I sat at a table at the front, where I could face out the front window rather than staring at the other diners. She brought me a menu and water right away. I asked her for a few minutes to consider the menu.

Looking around, the place was pretty drab, dreary and loud. Lots of conversations, cell phone and in person, filled the air, with nothing to absorb all of the sound. Ambience was, as the reviews had warned me, not on the menu. There was nothing even pleasant about the setting other than the smell of good food. It was VERY \"divey\" in every imaginable way. I started to get a little nervous about my choice.

When my server returned, I asked what vegetables were cooked with the Garlic Chicken, she indicated zucchini, onions, garlic, mushrooms, green peppers, and water chestnuts. 

I absolutely DETEST zucchini, and when I asked her if they could substitute broccoli for it, she quickly agreed that they would be very happy to do that. She was very careful to indicate \"no zucchini\" on the order in addition to requesting the broccoli. I can not tell you how much I appreciated that attention to detail. I didn't even want to see zucchini - I won't tell you the story that goes with that... but knowing I wouldn't have to look at or smell it made my server my favorite person on the planet for a few minutes. 

I asked her if I could get my dish made with white meat. She explained that for quality reasons, they use nothing but white meat for the dish, which also made me very happy. Finally, I asked for hot tea to complete my order.

I sat back to read my book and wait. It wasn't long before my place setting, and a dish of steamed white rice arrived, and right behind it, a delightful smelling and generous dish of Garlic Chicken. 

It was in a light, flavorful, aromatic sauce with ample amounts of thickly sliced chicken, broccoli, green peppers, mushrooms, onions, garlic and lots of water chestnuts. Everything was perfectly done! The onions were in nice sized pieces and still had a nice, but not overpowering bite to them.. The broccoli, mushrooms and green peppers were still a little crisp, but cooked enough to have absorbed the flavors of the sauce. The water chestnuts brought a nice crunch but flavorful presence to the dish. 

I spooned rice and garlic chicken onto my plate, added a touch of soy sauce, and lost myself in mouthful after mouthful of savory delight. (I am not exaggerating here - I was in Chinese food heaven.) I completely forgot about the setting, and the noise of other diners conversations and just ate for as long as I could. 

I finally had to surrender to the fact that I was going to take the other half of my dinner home. perhaps for lunch the next day. I emerged from my haze of food enjoyment to realize that I never got my hot tea. I also realized that my server had never returned to check on me, or anything. Luckily, everything had been perfect, so no problems there. So, I waited, and waited. Eventually, my server reappeared with my check, and a take out container. I supposed I could have looked for her, but no big deal.

I was pleased to see that I wasn't charged for the tea that I never got. It would have been good with my food, but I was so pleased with the meal that I couldn't bring myself to even mention it. There was also no charge for the change from zucchini to broccoli, which many other places would have decided to profit from. The dish was actually a great value for the quality and quantity I received.

I left feeling satisfied with having just consumed an excellent Chinese meal. I'm glad I took to heart the reviews of the food, and didn't let the ambience throw me off the scent. This was an experience I will be repeating. I think I'll try their delivery as well."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times now.  It kind of seems like the food is different every time.  The first time I had the mongolian beef it was really good, second time, not so much.  I really like the sesame chicken and General Tso's.  I like to call my order in, if you go in and order out you'll sit forever.  The food is over priced.  Sad to say I found another Chinese place to try, if it's better I'll switch for sure, food is much cheaper and has better reviews on here."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't go here anymore is because they got a super bad health inspection. :(

{"text":"All you can ask for in take out Chinese food! The orange chicken is some of the best I've had and the chicken lo Mein was delicious too. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the better Chinese places I've been to in Arizona. 

I will also say this: yes, he's a little crazy, but the bartender is cool. The first time I got carryout there they forgot an appetizer I ordered. I wasn't able to go back and get it that night, but when I called he remembered my name from the order. When I walked back in there a month or two later he immediately recognized me and said, \"oh, Zoe, let me get that crab Rangoon for you!\" and made sure it went out the door with me (for no charge, of course). I was impressed."}
{"text":"Great food, obnoxious bartender, average atmosphere, good service."}
{"text":"My husband was complaining that we don't have a \"Go-To\" Chinese place. Well I think we may have found it! Placed a To-Go order by phone and within 15 minutes there was a knock on the door! Ordered the Cashew Chicken and Lemon Chicken and hey threw in the a tab Puffs for free. We will definitely be ordering again soon!!"}
