{"text":"We ordered the dinner for 6 for $65 + tax and gratuities. Also added a hot and sour soup, which they do quite well and includes seafood in their version. 
The set dinner includes pumpkin soup with seafood....good! Not too thick, lots of seafood. Flavour not artificial. 
Next came the stir fry beef tenderloin with broccoli mushrooms and waffle chips. Not bad. Lots of garlic which is fine for us garlic lovers. Overall their dishes tend to be oily though. 
Next is baby bok choi veggies. Nothing surprising. Again too oily. 
Trendee house fried rice nicely presented. Fresh ingredients, one of the few fried rice I have had which actually use good quality chicken. Generous with seafood too. Again on oily side. 
Crispy skin chicken is normal. 
Crispy fried fish with sweet coating is kinda like honey chicken with fish. Bit too sweet for the Chinese palate IMO. Also comes with mayo with tabiko which added to its fusion -ness. Didn't use it though as the fish itself had enough flavour. Nicely fried, hot and crispy on outside, tender and flaky inside. They also sprinkle some corn flakes on top. 
Dessert is a small piece of mango pudding, nothing exciting. 
Very good service. Friendly. Clean enough, although some of the chair seats were visibly oily. 
Air con did not seem to be working that night, everyone in the restaurant was dripping with sweat! They need to fix it, that day was the heat wave day too!
Overall I would come back but mostly interested in their soups and to try their congee. 
Apparently same owners as Congee Queen."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to Trendee Chinese Cuisine.  It has a pleasant atmosphere and the food was surprisingly good.  I guess I was skeptical because the Thorncliffe Park area of East York isn't exactly known for its great restaurants.  The wonton noodle soup was very good and we shared a main course of both beef with kimchi as well as chili chicken.  Both were delicious.  I had a drink of lemon and honey which I wouldn't recommend because it was pricey and was half ice cubes.  And the drink itself was maybe 99% water with a drop of lemon juice and a drop of honey.

But really, I would definitely recommend Trendee Chinese Cuisine.  The menu is huge so I'll definitely be back to try the many other interesting choices.  As others here have pointed out, the service was very attentive.  Maybe a bit too attentive--like when one of the servers waited until my mouth was full of noodles before asking how the food was (I could only give a thumbs up).  But I won't complain about service that's *too* attentive.  How many times have I been in a restaurant where you have to pretty much send off a flare to get the wait staff's attention?

So definitely pay a visit to Trendee Chinese Cuisine."}
{"text":"So my family and I decided to give this restaurant a try today because it was grand opening week.

The decor was very nice and clean, I hope they keep it like this and maintain their clean decor. It was very modern looking, which I liked. There were booth seats as well as your standard tables. Roomy and the lighting's great.

The service was good and very attentive. It was kind of creepy at first, they were being way too friendly but I guess they have to really serve their customers to their best to keep them coming back!

We ordered a lot of different items and some were a hit and some were a miss. The food here definitely was super fresh! Which is a plus on my part but even if it was fresh, the flavour of some of the dishes were lacking (the har gow and sticky rice). My favourite dish would be the \"Steamed Special Rice Noodle Roll\", that was delicious and I would definitely go back there and order it again!

We also ordered their \"House Super Bowl Congee\", it was delicious too. I was not used to having the server scoop congee for all of us. We usually we scoop it ourselves because some people don't eat congee or only want a little bit. It was really nice of them and I kinda liked that extra service.

Overall, the restaurant was clean, new and modern and some of the food were great while some were lacking in flavour. Trendee will definitely be one of my go-to spots besides the usual Congee Star up on Don Mills Rd. I'll have to visit again later in the year to see if they were able to keep up with their friendly service."}
{"text":"after reading reviews on this place, thought I would take my family here to give it a try.

but after driving in circles a few times, we realized that this place had closed down - couldn't find it at all!"}
{"text":"My partner and I have visited this place after noticing this place is having a grand opening finally after a few month of noticeable renovations ! 

Place is clean, washroom is clean and great service with friendly stuff! One of the best \"congee\" I have ever tried. Price was slightly higher than other Chinese restaurant near the area but not to the point that it will break the bank. Fried rice and other dishes were fantastic too but they are equivalent to other places near by except the price. 

We were actually shocked that they have given us a complementary mango pudding and did not bring our check until we gave them a \"go\" which is totally unheard of in any Chinese restaurants.

Perhaps I will visit them again on occasion but didn't sway me enough to abandon Congee Star and Congee Queen (both located at Don Mills)"}
{"text":"Went to Trendee for an early diiner a couple days ago and loved everything we ate except the deep fried beancurd...that is the only reason for only giving 4 stars.

We LOVED their diced seafood with pumpkin thick soup...it was fabulous.

The place is so clean and roomy and the staff is great and so helpful.  The prices are a little bit higher than the \"Congee\" places in the area but I feel the food is superior (with beautiful presentation ) and so is the service so it is well worth the little extra...and they have some different items on the menu.  This will be our GO TO place for Chinese Food from now on

I also love that they deliver."}
