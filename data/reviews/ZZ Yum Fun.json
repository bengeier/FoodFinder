{"text":"Fun, reasonable, and different restaurant in a strip mall between Kent and Ravenna.  Haven't had anything but the hot pot, so I can't speak to the menu, but for hot pot you choose your own food, cook it, and season it yourself so if you don't like it, it's pretty much your own fault. :) A few tips (staff will help you but there can be a language barrier). The burners are induction, so you're not in danger of setting yourself on fire.  Ask for the \"choose your own\" menu to select a meat, vegetables, meatball, broth type, and rice/noodles.  Everything comes out very quickly, but while you wait, go to the sauce bar - mix some together or have them individually.  Set your pot to boil, reduce the heat, and add the meatballs first (they take the longest) and then add a bit of the other things, cook, remove, sauce. Repeat. Different, but not scary. Put the dishes you're done with on the wooden racks next to the table."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese hot pot.  We went there on a Sunday evening.  It is a big restaurant so it seemed empty, but there were three other tables besides ours.  It is perfectly set up for hot pot with induction ranges at each seat.    For the uninitiated hot pot can be a challenging way to eat since all the ingredients come out raw and you need to boil or blanch them in you own pot of broth.  The Chinese students at the next table were really enjoying it.  The Americans at another table found it difficult but adventurous.  In these places,  good service is needed to help people cook and season their food.  The waiter was very friendly and patient.  Prices are high but reasonable for the food that you get. The ambiance is clean and modern."}
{"text":"It has been closed for couple weeks due to the rental issue. ZZ Yum Fun provided an average level of service, but its price is pretty high. It has a very good Chinese chef who is working for Yummy Garden now."}
{"text":"If you enjoy trying new things I would definitely recommend coming to this hot pot restaurant. The food is fantastic and the experience amazing. You will not leave this place hungry. You are basically eating for an hour straight and the food actually appears to be pretty healthy for you."}
{"text":"Kind of weird place, not very good. Bad music and horrible idiotic staff. Tried to tell me 1 o clock is not lunch time. Tried to tell me normal dishes would be like \"Asian fondue\" what does that even mean?? Perhaps just anyone can open a restaurant these days...."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Chinese hot pot you have found the place. The ingredients are fresh and the soup base is very flavorful. My wife did not want hot pot so she got the beef and broccoli. She said it was the best that she had ever had. My son got the sweet and sour chicken. The portion sizes were very large and they both took home food. I would highly recommend this place. As far as hot pot it is the closest I have found outside of Chengdu."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese place around Kent. It is more expensive than the others with dishes ranging from $8-14, but it's worth it. The restaurant is super comfortable with a relaxing atmosphere. The sweet and sour chicken and Kung pain chicken are delicious. They are most famous for their \"hot pots.\" Each table has built in electric stoves to put the hot pot on. I've yet to try a hot pot since I just discovered this place, but saw other people using it and it looked so amazing. The service is great too. I highly recommend going here versus some cheap take out place."}
{"text":"Horrible service, the waiter was threaten us, because we asked \"can we order liquor at this place? or bring by our own \" and he said \"you all will going to jail\" we have 7 people, and we need to wait half hour only for green onion at sauce bar, and when we ask the waiter, he blamed us, because we didn't make reservation, he said all American know that, this is common sense. :) They just simply don't give shit about customer. I will never go to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite hot pot spot in the area - authentic flavors, wide selections, and reasonable prices. We ordered individual hot pots with around 3-4 meat and vegetable dishes per person, with a mix of spicy and non-spicy soup bases. The spicy soup is delicious and not over-the-top hot (though the soup does become more spicy as you boil the pepper in it). The tomato soup base is also very flavorful. Our bill came down to less than $20 per person and we had more than enough food. I will definitely come back to this place for my hot pot cravings."}
{"text":"Go for Lunch Mon-Sat and you can get a good deal on lunch hot pot sets.  I don't think they used to have sets for dinner, but they do now (daily).  However, note that while there are more options for sets at dinner, they are about 50% more expensive than at lunch for the same portion.  Service is typically pretty lackadaisical and can be slow even when you're the only party there.  I love soup, especially on a cold winter day, so I love that I can get refills on the broth.  Remember to make sauces for your food, especially if you get the plain broth."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and have enjoyed the food both times. When we dined in, the manager and server were so attentive, helpful, and friendly."}
{"text":"What a unique place, especially for the area. Being across from a Walmart, you wouldn't expect such a beautiful restaurant. My friends and I decided to try it and we all left happy. I had never tried hot pot before and it was definitely a lot of fun and such an experience! You pick your own ingredients and come up with your own soup creation.   Aside from hot pot, they also have a full menu of classic Asian dishes and appetizers. The service was really good and our waiter was very friendly. He didn't speak much English, but it wasn't a problem to get what we needed. Made the experience feel more authentic! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"ZZ Yum Fun is one of the most interesting and engaging dining experiences you're going to find in Kent.  I've only ate there once but I definitely plan on going again. It is not too expensive considering how much food comes with each meal. They also have great lunch specials. The only complaint I have is that the menu can be confusing and hard to understand. Other than that it was a great meal and an even better experience!"}
{"text":"This is the most unique asian food place I've ever eaten at. While it has a very upscale look to it, everyone was dressed casually.   The tables have ceramic stove tops in front of each seat in case you order one of their very popular \"hot pot\". With the hot pots you pick the type of meat, veggies, noodles/rice, and soup base you'd like. They bring it out to you raw and you cook it on your little stovetop. They have tons of different options!  They also serve meals such as orange chicken, general tso's chicken, pad Thai, etc. They make all of their sauces for these meals from scratch!   Orange chicken is one of my all-time favorite foods so I had to try theirs. SO GOOD. Next time though, I want to try a hot pot!  I have a feeling my boyfriend and I will become regulars here. It's right next to our home and they have take-out! The prices are also reasonable and comparable to other asian food places we've been to in the area."}
{"text":"Had very high hopes for this place, menu looked great.  Called at 7:00 and was told the order would be ready in 30 minutes. When we arrived the food was not done yet and hsd to wait another 20 minutes, which wouldnt have been a problem if the food was done...  Some of the food was great but our Orange Chicken was completely underdone, soggy and pink in the middle. The crab rangoon was cold and soggy with grease pouring out of it. Horrible experience and we will never return. Would have rather flushed $65 down the toilet."}
{"text":"I actually want to give this place 4.5 stars but the food is so good that I'm going to give it 5 because 4 doesn't quite do it. I'd knock off a half star if possible only because several people in my group when visiting didn't enjoy the experience at the time because it was a little confusing. If you've never done hot pot before it can be a little difficult to get the hang of and not everyone got the hang of it easily. We did talk to the staff to get a run down of the process and the ordering system (especially how to order, there's a couple of different sheets they have where you pencil in the ingredients you want that were unclear) but it still wasn't intuitive.  Once you get past that though, you're in for good times and crave-worthy food. Basically you get a pot of spicy or non-spicy (if you're okay with spice, get the spicy one) broth that boils in front of you, that you put raw veggies and meat in to cook then eat. Think of it like fondue.   I ordered the spicy broth with bok choy, lamb, water chestnuts, beef meatballs, carrots and noodles, all of which were part of a combo. All of these items have different cooking times which there isn't really a guide for but I think it's pretty easy to know when things are done cooking. If you have a question, just ask. The staff was helpful in this matter.  This is where I tell you about the SAUCE BAR. Which was obviously the best part and I implore you to try all of them individually and definitely mix them to customize your hot pot experience. Every iteration of sauce mixtures I tried was delicious, my favorite was the satay mixed with the hot pepper paste on top of lamb and noodles. Dank.   The cool thing about hot pot is that you get plates and bowls so you can eat your food in rounds. Make a spicy soup with meat, some veggies, a delicious sauce and noodles. Cook another portion in round two, strain the broth from your ingredients, add a completely different sauce and enjoy basically a different meal entirely. The possibilities are endless and that rules.   Things I would suggest, having experienced this already and that might help you:  1) if you go with a friend, one of you should get rice and the other get noodles. That way you can swap and share. Really share all of your ingredients (the portions are enormous so don't be afraid of running out of stuff) and enjoy an even more amazing selection of items. Not a single person in our party of 6 finished their meals, not even close.  2) get rice cakes. Trust me. 3) stick to stuff you know you like the first time you go. Once you get the hang of it you can (and will) go back and try everything.  4) ask questions if you have them. The staff will be as helpful as possible and make your experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a trip from Columbus to Pittsburgh. This place is amazing for being in a strip mall by the Walmart...DO NOT ALLOW THAT TO STOP YOU FROM GOING! This was some of the most authentic hot pot I've had outside of SF and Toronto. Fresh ingredients served on induction tables with amazing broth set this way way ahead of the normal Americanized Chinese joint. Of course, if you want the latter they have it. I order shrimp in lobster sauce to go and it was solid, but I didn't come here for that. I came for hot pot and this place delivers! There are ton of ingredient optioins, two broth options (house and hot). I ordered the hot which is spiced with not only red pepper, but the essential szechuan, or numb pepper. As for ingredients I had squid, tofu, trumpet mushroom, water chestnut, baby bok choy and noodles. One meal is two and worth every single penny! I will be back to Kent just to visit this place and that is not an exaggeration. If you don't know how to cook hot pot style, youtube it...It's super easy and such a fun way to have lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I graduated from Kent in 2009. At that time, Kent had only a few choices to get \"ethnic\" food. I never would have thought the Kent would get their own hotpot place. I mean I used to travel to places like NYC, Toronto, Or Chicago to find a dedicated hotpot place. Even Cleveland didn't have a hotpot place up until last October. That being said, I have to say that it took some guts to open this place in the small town of Kent.  Now, as far as the food goes, they offer a pretty decent Chinese style hotpot. If you're totally new to this concept, I recommend youtubing some instructions. Try the mushroom broth for more subtle flavor. Or if you want the smack in the face type flavor, try the spicy broth which is filled with chili and Sichuan peppercorns. All in all, I would come here again."}
{"text":"Never had hot pot before before but this place was an awesome first experience. The food was delicious and the staff were super helpful in explaining how it works and what to do. 10/10 would go there again"}
{"text":"PLEASE HELP KEEP ZZ OPEN! Below is a post from ZZs FB page - if you love their food and want them to stay, please make a call to help them!   Thank you for you support. We still negotiate with landlord. Today is last day they make decision. If everyone can make phone call to landlord they might let us stay. The phone number is  440-914-9000. Thank you again for everyone who supporting us."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Hubby and I went here for lunch.  I love how quickly we were greeted and how friendly everyone is.  We never had to ask for refills on our drinks!  Everything was explained to us and we were shown how the controls at the tables work.  Everything we ordered came out fresh and of excellent quality.  HOT POT is awesome for those that like to make their own!  It's really just something you have to experience!  I can't wait to come back and try other combinations!"}
