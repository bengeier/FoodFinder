{"text":"Have been here twice and although I love the happy hour specials specifically the ramen noodle bun pork belly sliders and the short ribs!  Both are awesome deals and satisfying the inner foodie, there is something wrong with this place and it starts with the first point of interaction...the hostess. Yeah the shorter skinnier paler looking Asian girl manning the hostess table outside of the entrance.  Both occasions she looked as though she was annoyed that she had to talk to people and could not force a fake smile. Also she didn't know if tables were available or not and needed to check, ummmmm sorry but isn't that your job to know?  Anyways this second occasion she seats us at one of the rows of tables that was half empty, hmm really? You needed to check?  Right...  Our server though was excellent! Very friendly and paid attention to us through out the dinning experience. So the food gets a 4 star, it would get a 5 if my spicy lamb ramen had more lamb in it than a minuscule amount of ground lamb bits. The server gets a 5 stars. But man oh man I just can't get past the hostess as I watched her take another table in with the same constipated face but when she was interacting with her coworkers she actually was laughing with them so I know she is capable of smiling so why not do that with your customers!?  First impressions go a long way...."}
{"text":"I love the the Ramen here!! i wish their spot is not in the mall!! Great staff!! Great food!!"}
{"text":"Goro & Gun Japanese Noodle Bar has opened in the +15 Level of the Scotia Building.  It's exciting to see a cool ramen and sushi place born out of a section of the huge expanse that was West nightclub.  Our plan was to try ramen today but they also have offerings of sushi rolls and sashimi as well as robata (grilled items).

The Spicy Lamb Ramen arrived at our table in minutes.  The fast and friendly service was appreciated given we were on a short downtown lunch break.  The flavours in this ramen were bold but not overly spicy.  The dish itself is beautiful with splashes of orange, green, and earthy mushroom.

Don't head here if you are looking for quiet.  You are greeted with a loud Japanese \"Welcome\" from the staff in the open kitchen.  The space is white and bright, clean and modern.  

We saw some lovely appetizers and sushi walking by but the ramen filled our bellies so we will have to come back.  Welcome to downtown Goro & Gun!  We've been waiting for you!"}
{"text":"Ramen was EXTREMELY salty I couldn't finish it. Felt like I grew a kidney stone from eating it."}
{"text":"We always enjoy going here.  Excellent ramen, rolls, hot items and cocktails. They have a number of beers on tap along with a nice selection of Japanese Whiskeys.  Service is excellent.  I haven't had a bad experience what so ever."}
{"text":"Food
I started with the short ribs and pork belly Ramen sliders. The Ramen sliders were interesting but a bit messy to eat. Ramen sliders $5 happy hour price regular $9

Tonkotsu broth which is a pork broth has a richer pork flavor and creamier consistency

Tonkotsu Ramen made with barbecue pork red ginger green onions and seaweed. price $12. Added smoked free range egg for $3. You tell the ramen noodles are fresh made

Miso Ramen made with barbecue pork red ginger green onions miso and seasoned  sprouts.  price $14

Atmosphere
Seems to be good for kids as they are playing Japanese anime on the TV

Service
Good prompt service. Servers very attentive. A bit on the pricey side"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi on a Friday night, the place was packed. We were looking for a light meal before going out and this was perfect. The rolls were decadent and tasted very fresh. The tempura and dumplings we had were also very good. Service was prompt and friendly even though it was a busy night and the atmosphere felt very authentic. The sushi was a bit pricey but the quality made up for it."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying Goro+Gun. I'm going to make it relatively short, since so many reviews have been done previous to mine.
My bf and I ordered the shrimp gyoza, shio ramen and a roll. 
The roll had fresh salmon, crunchy tempura and a mild hint of wasabi. Only comment on the roll was that the rice was a bit wet, making it hard to pick up with chipsticks.
The gyoza was alright, crispy bottom and a salty dipping sauce but nothing outstanding about them.
The ramen, which they are known for, is a smaller portion than other restaurants would typically serve. The hi-light of the bowl was the pork. It was by far a better quality meat than any I've seen in calgary. It was soft, fatty and rich. None of that dried, tough business with an unnatural pink circle on it. 
All in all I would rate my experience as good. I don't think Goro has anything that particularly draws me back by offering anything different from other sushi/ramen places, but is worth a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great spot for Happy Hour deals!! I felt like I left Calgary the price was so good.  My colleagues and I took our contractors there for dinner and had a fantastic time for so cheap.

I am not sure if Ramon is my preference, but it was delicious and plentiful.  The sashimi and sushi were awesome and their appetizers were tasty too.

My colleagues and I are looking to plan our next outing there again soon"}
{"text":"Good food and not too noisy to have a real conversation. Definitely book a table for the lunch hour.  They need to do a bit better job of evenly apportioning the Ramen. My lunch mate had significantly more pork belly and Kimchi then I received."}
{"text":"My short-lived affair with Goro+Gun started off on a rocky note. We (2 kids and 3 adults) were hanging out at the Core and decided to grab dinner at G+ G. The hostess told us she didn't have any tables available (the front tables were all empty and stayed empty for the 70minute duration of our meal) but will check with her manager. In the 3 minutes it took her to do that, I had made a reservation with the Yelp app so when she came back to tell us they were fully booked, we already had a reservation. End of Chapter 1

We were promptly seated and our drinks order taken. The drinks came and we placed our food order which the server took without actually writing anything down. Important to say that because of course some items were forgotten. End of chapter 2

I ordered the okonomiyaki (green cabbage, green onions, pork belly, cheese & mochi) for my appetizer and the other adults in the group had sushi and dumplings. The kids had edamame. All were good and my okonomiyaki was the hands down best part of the meal. End of chapter 3

All the adults ordered ramen dishes and the barbecued mackerel for the kids. This is where it all started to go downhill. The spicy lamb ramen can more accurately be described as ramen noodles in broth garnished with a smattering of shredded lamb. It was disappointing in appearance and taste. We did our best to salvage it with the hot chilli oil, soy sauce and spices but in the end,no one could eat more than half their serving. The bbqed mackerel was forgotten and put on rush order. When it did show up, it was full of bones and I wasn't excited about feeding it to my kids. I had a taste and it was bleh. THE END

Appendix: one additional star off because the server forgot my cousin's sake order and when we asked another server for the missing sake, she grabbed the glass of sake already on the table (belonging to another guest) and proceeded to sniff the contents of the glass to confirm that it wasn't the missing sake. This same server routinely passed her hand over our plates of food. Who puts their nose in other peoples' food?!

All of this for a bill of ~$130! (Yelp needs some emoticons for me to convey exactly how I feel)

Summary: in case it's not obvious from everything I've written; this place is not family-friendly and not worth a return trip from me."}
{"text":"For any newbies to Japanese cuisine (like me) you need to come here. This was an amazing experience. The vibe is laid back and stylish, the staff are energetic and friendly, and the food...well it was FULL of all kinds of flavor. My husband tried the eel and loved it, I had a soup and it was perfectly done! You can order sake by the glass or the bottle - perfect!"}
{"text":"Mediocre and way overpriced. Service was very slow because they're understaffed. Thought we would the chefs special which was five sushi pieces but was $18, more than our lunch item. I was caught completely by surprise.  You also have to pay for water which I thought was cheap.  Noodles were bland and expensive. Never trying this place again."}
{"text":"Yo. First of all. $13 for a bland tonkatsu ramen. 2 small pieces of not good pork. And $3 extra for an egg?! Had to add a ton of chilli powder to make it taste like anything. On the bright side bartender was cool and Sapporo was crisp. Would have given an extra star if it was cheaper though."}
{"text":"Where to begin?  Went at lunch with a colleague and were treated to lackluster service, burnt food and dishes that were simply not at a high enough quality level to justify their outlandish pricing.  Once the waitress took our drink order, she forgot about us and we had to place our order with a random staff member that we flagged down.  Strike 1.  Next we place our order and indicate that we wanted to start with the Gyoza, followed by the Dynamite Roll and the Seared Yellow Tail rolls.  The rolls come out before the gyoza which sort of defeats the purpose of the appetizer. Strike 2.   The rolls themselves aren't really rolls, rather cucumber rolls with piles of fish and other toppings heaped on top of them which makes them hard to eat.  Both of us ended up eating the meat first and then the roll after.  No cohesiveness at all.  Finally, the Dynamite Rolls are chopped pieces of shrimp that on at least 2 of them had all tail and no meat.  Strike 3.  After speaking with the manager, the shrimp are meant to be eaten in their entirety, tail and all?  

Failures on service, implementation and most importantly taste."}
{"text":"A pretty good restaurant with a lively atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food.

The restaurant is sort of set up like a bar. There are tables and booths around, as well as high bar-style tables in the middle. Our party of 8 was seated in the middle of the restaurant at a long bar-style table that comfortably seated all of us.

Our server was very friendly and accommodating, and did her best to make sure that the seating and bill situation was sorted out beforehand. A larger party like ours is naturally harder to server, so appreciate the extra effort she put in.

As for food, we all started with gyozas to share, and then each ordered our own bowl of ramen. The gyozas were very interesting (in a good way). Instead of the traditional pork filling, they contained lamb meat, which added a nice gamey kick. I'm not a huge lamb fan, but these were quite tasty, although a bit on the salty side.

Continuing my rare journey into lamb-ville, I ordered the spicy lamb ramen for my main. The broth (the most important element of good ramen) was very rich and flavourful, with just enough spice to complement the initial savoury taste without overpowering everything. The noodles were nothing to write home about, but served their purpose as a flavour medium, were nice and firm (there's nothing worse than soggy noodles!), and were served in generous portions. I was absolutely stuffed by the end of the bowl, which rarely happens with ramen! That being said, I think Shiki-Menya or Shikiji are still the ones to beat in terms of noodle quality.

All in all, it was a great ramen experience. I would definitely come back here again.

I should also add that it was extremely easy to book a space for a party of 8 at 7:30PM on a Friday evening, which is pretty rare for a ramen place, and a huge contrast from having to wait an hour to be seated for lunch at Shiki-Menya!"}
{"text":"Went to Goro and Gun for lunch with a coworker on a Thursday afternoon. I had taken a look at some of the menu photos prior going to lunch and the sushi looked interesting, but was definitely overpriced. After having poor experiences with seafood in Calgary, I decided to order the lamb skewer to start and the shio ramen. Service was very good. Our server was very familiar with the menu and made good recommendations. The lamb skewers came out very quickly and were okay - but I found the meat very fatty. My bowl of soup was less than extraordinary. It tasted slightly more favorable than a package of instant noodles (and was significantly more expensive) with only two slices of pork. The majority of the bowl was filled with noodles which were plain and bland. I may go back to try other appetizers but their ramen bowls are not worth it. The service was great which is what would bring me back - but it wouldn't be my first choice for Asian food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my Bento Box as it was change from you typical North American  Japanese bento boxes. The service was good. The server was attentive and not over barring which allowed my party to enjoy their lunch  and conversation. Quick service over the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Their ramen used to suck so bad but they've changed up their ramen menu recently and it's so much better ! Asides from Jinya, surprisingly this is one of my favourite places now for ramen"}
{"text":"I want to like G&G, I really do. So much so, that I've been here 3 times to convince myself. They say 3rd time's a charm right? Not in this case.

The food is mediocre at best. I've tried their ramen (both pork belly and miso) which I found both were really bland, spicy salmon roll (the fish and rice were soggy and the roll fell apart immediately when grazed with chopsticks) and their ramen burger appetizer (interesting concept, not much depth in flavour)

I think they stay busy because of their prime location, but I'd rather save my stomach (and my money) for something more worthwhile."}
{"text":"I like this place. I took my work team to lunch here last week on a Thursday - high noon. We had a reservation so we were seated right away. The place was busy!

The menu was simple yet has enough choices to make most people happy. Our server did a great job of explaining the specials as well as a few menu items my guests were unsure of. I opted for the kimchi ramen. They were out of Yakisoba so my sidekick has to copy me and have the same thing. Our third guest had another form of ramen involving shellfish. Mmmmm

Everything came out super fast. Granted they confused our orders initially but they fixed the issue super fast. My ramen was nice - spicy, with yummy bits of pork belly. kimchi and other things. Proper ratios of everything. Their presentation was pretty awesome too.

What I liked about this place for lunch, other than the speed, is that I was full after but not gross full and my taste buds were hap-hap-happy. I'll definitely be back to try some other things.

It does get loud in there so be prepared to yell a bit at whoever you are there with (in a nice way)."}
{"text":"Really great food - full of flavour. Bold flavours not overpowering the subtlety of some of the dishes. Staff is great, and the kitchen greats you with a boisterous yell making you feel welcome from the start. 

Our server was awesome, and when she didn't know something, she would to find out for you which doesn't normally happen in a downtown restaurant. 

A must visit. We will be going back."}
{"text":"I love places that openly promote their happy hour deals and welcome happy hour goers. I always saw their big sign out the front of the restaurant for their $5 food and drink happy hour deals and finally gave this place a go - and I highly recommend you do too.

On a Tuesday afternoon at 4:30pm, this place is dead and you'll have your pick of tables including long benches for bigger groups and comfy booths that fit 4-5 people. I was greeted immediately with 'Irasshaimase!' by all of the staff when I walked in, which I haven't heard in a while. We had a great server who regularly came by the table and was great with suggesting food options for five people (the prawns come with five pieces) and could talk knowledgeably about the menu.

My favourite happy hour options were: sake, Tomo's house roll (changes every few days), ramen burgers (messy but delicious), tataki and tuna poke. I also love that they have a decent list of nine $5 food options and beer, wine and sake drink specials too. 

Note: Some of their specials are slightly smaller than the normal dishes, which is entirely reasonable. They also happily split our bill! Check the happy hour list out here: http://goroandgun.ca/events."}
{"text":"Will I go back? Yes

You can get gluten-free ramen here ! Woohoo
They can only do the mushroom broth GF but it is sophisticated in flavor. You will not regret!

P.S. I usually stick to ramen here bc it seems to be their specialty"}
{"text":"Goro + Gun took over the old West location in TD Square. I didn't event know West had closed but the owners of this Japanese noodle house have completely transformed the space into an open, bustling ramen joint. 

They serve a limited selection of delicious, large and authentic ramen bowls, sushi-house style appetizers and a few nigiri, some select sashimi and a small list of sushi rolls. Even with a menu that is seemingly small, the selection is varied, the portions large and they have a daily sushi roll feature.

All the staff greet and thank the staff in Japanese (thank goodness for the Mr. Roboto song or I wouldn't have know what Arigato meant) and charmingly yell a Japanese phrase across the restaurant as new clients take their seats.

Though they have been in business only a short while, the hostess says they are slammed busy with the downtowners at lunch and I can see why; with the open, casual, bustling atmosphere, good food, a funky soda water list and charming Japanese touches, Goro + Gun is somewhere I would definitively visit again.

T."}
{"text":"A great location in downtown for Japanese cravings which comes with Happy Hour. The location, design, decoration, and layout were great. On my visit, I didn't get the Irasshai greeting I received from other customers. 

Unfortunately, the taste in food isn't up to my expectations and perhaps may be more favored towards a neutral palette. The Takoyaki are fine although I find it to be warm than hot in temperature. The ramen is a disappointment for me, the broth was bland for me, the pork meat was ok. The Yakisoba noodles were even a letdown, where's the meat? The overall taste was sweet & sour for Yakisoba? I don't know what to say about that, but it is definitely not for me. 

Overall, I would come back to try other menu items and avoid the ramen/noodle section to give it another chance."}
{"text":"New place in the old West location in Scotia Centre. Service was prompt, professional and friendly. Very friendly in fact. 

Had the ribs and the spicy lamb ramen with gluten free noodles. The meal was delicious. Flavours well balanced and I didn't feel like I was ingesting a pound of salt as I enjoyed the soup. The ribs were brilliantly good. Tenderized and had an accompanying sauce that was very well paired. 

Great job on a new spot that'll be terrific for the lunch and dinner crowd downtown. 

(Also had the Japanese Manhattan. Very good. The do it in a way that makes it more smokey than usual.)"}
{"text":"It's one of those cases where I would like to give 3.5 stars. Their happy hour deals are pretty good. And yes, the ramen burger is delicious, even though it usually makes a mess eating them. Satay prawns are very tasty, so is the the Tataki. Poke is okay. I tried the spicy lamp ramen, very greasy, flavor was okay but not great. Mind you, after you had ramen at Shiki Menya, you are pretty spoiled. So I'm planning on trying more ramen at this place, maybe there are better ones. 

Lots of seating available, good for both larger groups and an intimate date. The $10 ramen happy hour is only available at the tachigui stand up noodle bar, which is to your right when you enter the restaurant, in front of the bar, looking out of the restaurant towards Starbucks."}
{"text":"Great spot, but pricey for such a limited sushi menu. I came here for a business lunch and ordered a roll and sashimi, both of which were delicious. The portion size was good too, which makes the price easier to manage. Decor is non-traditional and funky, and the whole kitchen greets you with a loud Japanese hello when you arrive (it's true -- listen for it!). Cool spot but would love a bigger selection on the menu."}
{"text":"I would've given Goro & Gun 4 stars, except the prices for what you get are IMO STEEP.
The Entree's for example, looking at the menu I ordered the Short Ribs, and my son ordered the chicken. When it came out, I thought is this some kind of joke. The ribs were the equivalent of one short rib you would get at a Korean restaurant. The difference being in a Korean restaurant you get two. They just cut one, into 4-5 bite size pieces. The chicken Entree was also a huge disappointment, two small skewers of what would be the equivalent of a Chicken Yakitori appetizer in any other Japanese restaurant. My wife ordered the Miso Ramen, with extra noodles. The regular sized bowl of any other good Ramen place in Calgary like Muku's or Menyatai.
The two entree's themselves were $12.00 each.
I won't be back to Goro & Gun anytime soon. The prices are just a little high for a family dining out. 
I'm assuming since it's located where it is, that it's catering to the business crowd that can expense their meals.

Wish the portions matched the prices.
In conclusion, the food was good I just expected more !"}
{"text":"I passed by the restaurant a few times unsure if I should go in as I usually do not like to eat out by myself. I am glad I made an exception this time. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and happy to offer suggestions to Noodle Bar virgins such as myself. The restaurant was packed by the downtown suit and tie crowd during lunch time (which made me feel a little out of place in my ripped jeans and leather jacket)
I ordered Shio Ramen with pork belly, hakurakusei junmai daiginjo sake and ramen sliders (not on the menu) which were clearly the highlight of the meal.
The noodles were chewy good, the pork belly - melt-in-the-mouth fall-aparty. The sake, well let's just say I still have a nice buzz. 
The ramen slider is basically a beef patty in between two noodle cakes topped with kimchi and unagi (eel sauce) as simple as it is, kudos to whoever came up with the idea. 
The only thing missing was SLURPING! But I guess Canadians are too polite for that.
All in all a great dining experience.
As for eating out alone at GORO+GUN, food is the only companion you need here."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I experienced this restaurant before it explodes!

I'll warn first timers that it's on the second floor of the Scotia Centre off Stephen Ave.

This is a modern, open kitchen concept Japanese restaurant that serves a memorable bowl of ramen. I had their Kimchi Pork Belly Ramen Soup, and it was delicious. I was seriously eyeing their Spicy Lamb Ramen. I'll be sure to get that at my next outing.

They offer a nice selection of Japanese beers, other beers, and sake. I loved their Loco Coast (ginger beer) beer. I've had ginger beer and it usually has too much kick from the ginger for my liking. Loco Coast was very nice. 

I see this restaurant going far in Calgary's dining scene. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Goro and Gun on an evening (I think it was on a Saturday)... which was a mistake because I realized then that this place is a lunch time venue. 

I say that because when we arrived it was dead and had zero ambience. We got seated and ordered some drinks. The one I had was actually really good but expensive so I stuck to one. 
The meals... I ordered cold ramen and the boy had sushi. The food was good but again... I felt like we were having lunch and not dinner.

Wouldn't come back in the evening, just not a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Four of us came at a Saturday night 8pm. Not a lot of ppl. Didn't have to wait. The service was rather slow... but ramen was awesome! Spicy lamb is not too spicy but with thick soup that is flavored to perfect. I ordered the mushroom noodle. The vegetable combination is so fresh I just love it!"}
{"text":"Though this isn't the best ramen in the city, it's pretty good if you're working in the core and want ramen, but don't want to drive. My favourite dish by far is the Tuna Poke. First, I hadn't had avocado in my poke before, and boy, did they ever go well together!! Next, the tuna, avocado and everything in it is always so fresh. 

I also like the Tokotsu Ramen with an added smoked egg and the Calamari. Personally I wasn't so keen on the Spicy Lamb Ramen and the Yakisoba, but I believe that's more my taste preference rather than anything else."}
{"text":"Food was decent. The bench seats offers no back support for someone with back issues. When we made the reservation, we asked to be seated at a booth but they would not seat us there since there were only 2 of us. Seems like they prefer to sit more people rather than please the customers"}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation as we don't live in Calgary. The restaurant itself has a nice feel to it - clean and visually appealing. My boyfriend and I were seated at a table that was next to the open kitchen so it was good to look over once in a while to see what was happening. We ordered the miso kimchi ramen bowl, the lobster california roll, a rainbow roll, and an order of hamachi sashimi.  The miso ramen bowl came out first, i wasn't expecting it be brigh orange in color. The broth was good, very thick though, and the pork belly (2 pieces) were succulent, moist and delicious. The rolls, however, were nothing to write home about. Smaller in size compared to most other Japanese restaurants, and the fish roe were large and fishy so we removed those from both our rolls. The \"rainbow roll\" did not come with tempura bits like we anticipated. Instead, they were filled with a variety of finely chopped greens (ie cucumber and avocado). My boyfriend (who usually loves rainbow rolls) was not thrilled with the green filler inside so he picked it all out and was left with a small bit of rice and sad looking sashimi. The lobster california roll was not great either - i couldn't taste the lobster since the garlic sauce overpowered the roll - it ended up being an overpriced california roll of which I've had way better. As for the yellow tail sashimi, I wasn't sure how many pieces it came with as the menu did not specify so when it arrived with just 2 pieces I was a bit surprised since it cost $6.50 for that small portion. All in all, nothing special about this place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Last Friday I got a chance to  try out @goroandgun. We ordered spicy salmon sushi as appetizer. It was one of the best sushi I ever tried. So fresh. I ordered spicy lamb ramen it was sooo good. Well, not that much spicy. Because I am brown.  I was quiet surprised by seeing cremebrulee in their today's special. Since it's a Japanese restaurant. Cremebrulee is my all time favourite dessert. Staffs are very very friendly. Overall it's a nice ambience and food. I will be back for more sushi one day. Because it's the best."}
{"text":"It's my probably fourth time here. Their best ramen in the regular menu is the spicy lamb ramen. But I do recommend you follow their Instagram. They will post their weekly special dishes on the Instagram, you can ask for new dishes every week. I really like the experience of trying new food. The happy hour is from 3-6pm. All the starters are $5. Good place if you like Japanese food, and want to have a good time with your friends."}
{"text":"I'm torn on my final rating of Goro and Gun, because the place looks amazing and we had an okay experience. 

However, my two bits of criticism are that although gluten-free options are available, there is a major lack of clarity on the menu as to which ramen broths have gluten and don't have gluten. I didn't get a clear explanation, either, so I found this hard to deal with. Service was meh overall. 

I guess I'm not really into ramen bowls in general, so the sushi is a welcome complement."}
{"text":"Pork belly ramen was excellent.  Head on tempura shrimp and sushi was spot on.  Next time I visit Calgary this will be my first stop for sure."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a Japanese Noodle House forever and since this is my first one it will be my bench mark.  Not the cheapest with all the add ins but this to me an an authentic Japanese feel to it. My food and the ambience was excellent. The staff was knowledgable and friendly. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Horrible service sub par food. Not worth it at all. 
I ordered the taipan ramen which comes with bamboo and carrot. My ramen did not have either the waiters excuse is they ran out. Got lamb gyoza almost chocked on a piece of bone. Neither manager or chef came to apologize or resolve the situation. Though Mela was comped.... I had one gyoza and a few bites of ramen.  Walked away hungry and upset. Manager avoided eye contact when I saw her and went on cell phone. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Goro & Gun is a great sushi/ramen restaurant.  The space is cool, the atmosphere works and the sushi is a cut above average.  One of the better Calgary choices for sure!

To keep things fair, I've been ordering the same basic sushi at every restaurant (with some slight variations).  In keeping with that plan, I ordered edemame, salmon sashimi, avocado/cucumber rolls, and tuna rolls.

Here's what irritated me at Goro.  For some reason, they are so intent on slathering their rolls up with tempura and sauce, there are no basic rolls on the menu.  When I asked the waiter for a basic tuna roll with none of the extra stuff, he was pretty incredulous and actually laughed.  \"Something funny about that?\" I asked.  He got back to business, but wouldn't promise me a basic roll.  Low and behold, when the tuna rolls came out... it was exactly what I didn't order.  I sent it back.  The second try was just fine.  (I don't know why they couldn't put the tuna IN the roll ... it was more of a cucumber roll with a tuna \"hat\") No big deal.  I'm picky, they aren't used to it ...  I'd still go back.

Goro is probably one more expensive sushi restaurants, but if you're on a date or otherwise want a chill/trendy atmosphere... this is a good bet."}
{"text":"I'm never reading an urbanspoon review again. Let that start whatever it starts, we yelpers can take you urbanspoonites, but a 50% rating (or whatever rating system you have, it makes no sense to me), but Goro deserves a better rating not founded on your first world problems!

The food arrived within record time. From what I would a lack of time means a lack of quality, our appetizers and ramen were warm and fresh. We started with the salmon tartare. It's lightly season with an addicting tangy I wanted more and more of. We had the eel appetizer which jogged our tastebuds accordingly.

Alas, the ramen. The new TACO of Calgary. By that I mean the new street dish taken to culinary levels, meaning Chefs will be taking a stab at the Japanese common man food and fiddle with it which can be a good thing or a bad thing. It can taste amazing or be an disappointing flop amplified by a high price tag. That said, Goro PLUS Gun, your Spicy Lamb Ramen...is THE MOVES. The broth was balanced and I enjoyed the spice didn't kick down my throat that I ended up choking the noodles down. Nay, I choked those noodles down because they were firm and thin, a different contrast to the usual thicker varieties I've found in most of Calgary's restaurants.

A pricey meal, but I think it's worth it. Good job Goro PLUS Gun, I was originally a skeptik at the noodlebar movement because I'm cursed with being a foodie and a hipster who's repeatedly seen THE MIND OF A CHEF, I welcome the ramen movement."}
{"text":"This post is for happy hour only. The sashimi plate and service gets 5 stars. For only $5 bucks I got a plate of fresh, beautifully cut sashimi. I counted: toro, two slices of red tuna, two pieces of salmon, and one ebi. 

The Tomo Roll was something I never tried before. Raw salmon and tomato rolled in nori and soy, dolloped with spicy mayo. Refreshing and a steal at $5.00. 

The tuna poke was great for $5.00. Cubes of tuna are mixed up with mixed lettuce, seaweed salad, sesame seeds and a soy sauce. 

Other dishes for $5: edamame, yam tempura, chicken yakitori, tataki (I think) and ramen sliders.

If you stand up at the bar, you can sample their ramen for only $10.00. At the tables, ramen is regular price. 

Service was excellent. Sapporo beer and select wines are only $5.00 too! The sushi here is delicious and very fresh. I'm keen to come again for the regular menu to try more of their sashimi."}
{"text":"Let's not beat around that bush that people so like to beat around. Ramen burger sliders + happy hour were the entire reason I came here, but now that I've experience the world of Goro + Gun, they're the big reason I can't wait to come back for a full-on meal experience. 

For a unique happy hour drink and appy combination, Goro + Gun kicks some major butt. If you check out their website, you'll learn that \"six stock pots simmer with delicious broths.\" You'll \"tuck into a steaming bowl of Hakata-style ramen, made even better with a smoked egg. Or depart from noodle fare with house specialties like the lobster sunomono salad or chicken robata...\"

It sound sexy, right? But what makes Goro + Gun all the more sexy to me is that I've never even had their specialties and I'm still over the top smitten. 

As far as drink go, they bring sake to the masses. If you realize there's a thing or two for you to learn about sake, go here for a happy hour and get schooled on it. But that, I mean ged educated on sake... There's a new world out there to explore - Goro + Gun keeps it approachable yet completely authentic."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with coworker.  Had the shio ramen which was ok.  Coworker had the lamb ramen and she said it was good. They said the soup broth has no msg but the flavour was not intense enough at least for me for the shio ramen.  The noodles were ok.  I prefer the chewier, eggier, curlier version of noodles rather than the wheatier straighter version that goro and gun serve.

Nice presentation and the waiters are nice. Atmosphere is open and modern as a remnant of the old West bar / lounge layout.  I rather prefer the old style intimate Japanese hustle bustle type eateries that are in Vancouver and LA where you crowd around small tables or the cooking area with the boiling vats of soup and noodles however.

Ok in a pinch for a downtown location.  Not as good as the original Shikiji ramen or their current version which is not quite as tasty as the original, but still ok for a noodle fix."}
{"text":"Tha ramen was great. The add-ons to the ramen were really good and worth the extra price. The sushi though were excellent! Two thumbs up! Try it!"}
{"text":"Goro and Gunn is pretty new on the Calgary food scene and inhabits the bottom floor of the now defunct West restaurant and Bar in the Scotia building (just at the top of the escalator on the 2nd floor of the building). I've only ever been here for dinner and thus have not experienced the rushed lunch hour they apparently get there. 

The ambiance is awesome, very modern, chic, and open. They have a bunch of family style long tables and seats at the bar/along the kitchen and their booths are comfortable and large, though there are not too many of them. Their cocktail menu is pretty awesome, my friends and I got a couple and they all tasted great. They are all pretty fun and different--and a good cocktail place is something we definitely need in Calgary so that is a plus. 

Their spicy lamb ramen is by far my favourite, the broth has the best flavour. You can also add a bunch of extras to it, like egg, pork belly etc, but this one is fine on its own. For the plainer shio ramen I would consider adding the pork belly or something to it to jazz it up a bit. BIG fan of the sushi here, especially the spicy tuna. The lure of the ramen restaurant is to go for the ramen but I think the sushi is enough in its own right. The ramen burgers are delicious, but just mini slider style and only two come in a portion so maybe not a good idea to go with them for your complete meal but great as a novelty item! 

Also, price is very reasonable, with around $12 for a giant bowl of ramen, or $12 for a large portion of sushi, you can't go wrong. 

Would definitely recommend for the cocktails, sushi, and a change in the Calgary food scene."}
{"text":"Me and five co-workers eat at Goro Gun and found the ramon was tasteless and the pork was mostly fat and the bill was a joke for what we got!!!  As a group of Six we all said it was our first and last time."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for lunch and dinner. If there was a change to give zero stars, that is what I would have given them. Service was terrible....or maybe it was the complete lack of service. The soup was cold and no one came to ask how the food was. I had to eat it because I didn't have time to wait for someone to come and tell them to heat up my food. I could barely wave anyone down and the restaurant wasn't even that busy....they definitely need to step up their service. If it wasn't because it's the only Ramen place in the Core, I would not be going back!"}
{"text":"One of my few favorite place for Tuna Poke  Shashimi and Chicken Teppanyaki. Make sure to try their featured OMAKASE COCKTAIL as well. Amazing happy hour deal for those who likes  seafood. Nice place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Overall my first experience at Goro & Gun was a positive one. Our server was very friendly and the food came quickly during our late lunch. The Gyoza and prawn  tempura were both really good. I also had the yakisoba, but thought it had some strange flavours and was not super-happy with it. I would come back to try other items though."}
{"text":"Im from Edmonton, went around to find a ramen place, twas 4pm Wednesday and a poster was outside saying happy hour.

Went inside but seems no one was in the restaurant , place was empty. no one greeted me.. So I thought it was closed,, so I left.."}
{"text":"Goro and Gun is always a busy place around lunch time with the business crowd and for good reason. With a menu built around ramen and sushi, it's ideal for quick lunches.

On a recent visit, I tried the spicy lamb ramen. The portion was generous with the flavourful broth and thin noodles. However, despite the name, I needed to add hot sauce at the table as there was no discernible spicy-ness to the dish. I'll note that they use ground lamb in this dish; the meat was tasty, but stew pieces would have made for a better quality dish.

At $13-$16 per bowl, the prices are a little high, but that's to be expected for the location and style of the place."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and decently priced if you go for happy hour. Fish has always been fresh and tasty. Ramen is decent.

Some of the dishes we have enjoyed were their shrimp with spicy sauce, tuna poke, and sushi appys. Their happy hour menu usually features some tasty, fairly priced items.

Probably one of the better sushi places in the downtown core."}
{"text":"The yague ramen burger sliders were amazing.  I would definitly try them again.  The chefs use thermometers for temps so they can get it right.   They like to leave it on the pink side though because of the wuality of burger meat"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this place a traditional Japanese restaurant, its more of an American take on traditional Japanese food. I had the ramen burger and the lamp ramen. The burger was so unique, tasted great, and a great fusion food. My lamp ramen was tasty but the broth was a bit too creamy for my liking. If you are looking for a great ramen or sushi place, i suggest you try somewhere else. But the food is great if you take authenticity out of the equation. My Lamp ramen broth was very very flavourful. 
The restaurant has a very first date vibe to it, casual but cute, they prove booths and shared long tables. My server was very friendly, answered my many many questions without showing any irritation. I would say try this place if you're in the area and looking to fill your bellies."}
{"text":"I've been a server for over 10 years so I'm really picky. I came in with my girlfriends. The service was wonderful. The server was very attentive. The GM Amane took great care of us. The mushroom ramen and sushi was so good. The green tea desserts were out of this world. I would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Good place if it isn't too busy. Ramen is excellent, broth is flavorful, add-ons (particularly the smoked egg) are perfectly delectable. Service is good and the decor and ambiance is one of the best I've seen in a Ramen shop. Prices are reasonable considering where they are located. Reliable and recommended."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Goro and Gun but I was generally disappointed.  Hubs has had it on the radar since taste of calgary's ramen burgers a while back. Generally it's difficult to get good Japanese food beyond sushi that's vegetarian without fish.  I had found some good food in Japan but in Calgary there isn't a lot of options and Goro and Gun are pretty much more of the same.  Yes I COULD eat it but it was just OK and ultimately way too expensive and out of my way to return to.

I ordered green tea lemonade, lychee sake, mushroom ramen, and white chocolate green tea cheese cake.   Nothing was good nor bad.  With drinks they took good Eastern flavours and tried to westernize them and it wasn't good for either profile.    For the Raman the vegetarian both was under developed. Broth in Japan is a big ordeal and the vegetarian  version is a complex process with kombu but G+G tasted like onion soup and lacked the strong umami  and I generally like Ramen with thicker noodles than G+G.  they also didn't have a vegetarian egg (they are boiled in broth) to put into mine so that was also sad.   For the dessert I only took one bite and past it off to hubs because it was not as described or expected.   For one,  I could taste no white chocolate and the green tea gave the cheese more of a pumpkin pie texture/flavour which I loathe.   I like green tea chocolate but they just haven't captured it. 

Overall it's got a cool vibe and atmosphere but it's not the food I liked about Japan so it's not really my thing.  I do like that they have okinomiyaki which I don't see around... I didn't see it but it seems to be a play on the Osaka style but it's not something I can eat at G+G so I'll have to stick to making mine at home."}
{"text":"Ramen! Delicious, delicious ramen!

I came to the Yelp page for Goro and Gun today to book a reservation and realized that I have not yet reviewed my favorite ramen place?!?! I have tried a few of the available ramen bowls (all with the option of the gluten free noodles which are amazing) and I believe the miso kimchi ramen is the best. Obviously characterized by the kimchi flavor, this ramen bowl is very full of other flavors as well. The portions are large and filling so it ends up being a reasonable price ($14) for lunch. The lamb ramen bowl is also very popular if you love the taste of lamb which dominates the taste of that bowl. Overall, the place is laid back but still has nice décor with great service. They also have a nice selection of sakes, sodas, and teas. I recommend the genmaicha as it is my favorite. Also the pork is amazing and I am always tempted to order extra (even though then I can't eat the whole bowl).

Goro and Gun is the place to go for gluten free ramen!"}
{"text":"I really, really, really wanted to like this place.  I have walked past Goro + Gun several times, the smells are wonderful the place looks very cool and chic.

So I finally stopped in, on a Monday night, it was pretty dead in here, as most of downtown Calgary is on a weeknight after 6pm.  There was a lovely host that greeted me and took me to a spot along the bar.  The gal working the bar indicated that my server would be right with me.  Not 30 seconds later there was a gal ready to take a drink order.  I asked about unfiltered sake.  There was a large selection of sake on the drinks menu, so I inquired about unfiltered sake....  \"Ummmmm\" (the response from my server)... that's ok, I don't expect everyone to know about unfiltered sake.  She pointed out her favourite, which happened to be the only unfiltered sake on the menu.  The drink was in front of me and the food order was placed.  Oddly the sake came in a regular white wine glass.  To be honest I think a tumbler would have been a better choice than a white wine glass.  Or maybe even a traditional sake cup ? Maybe ?    
I tried the sake... blech... considering that it's $8 for a 3 oz pour, this stuff was nasty.  

My Miso Ramen was up shortly there after.  So remember earlier I had noted the lovely smells... well it obviously isn't from the ramen.  Not that it smelled bad... it just really didn't smell at all.  Which is in line with the taste.  The ramen was very plain tasting.  The pork belly that was included in the ramen was good, but the broth was rather plain and extremely salty.  The noodles were cooked properly, but it was nearly impossible to separate the noodle bunch, to get just a few to put on the spoon.  

Overall:  considering the price of the food, I really expected and hoped it would be better.  I was hoping to make this my go to place.  I love the ambiance.  The service could have been a bit more attentive, but not bad service.  I just struggle with the very ordinary ramen and the value of it.  I'll go back to try some of the other offerings, but the first impression wasn't an overly positive one."}
{"text":"Decent ramen place for the downtown lunch crowd, they are pretty accommodating to large groups which is nice. I've tried both the ramen and the sushi there and probably prefer the sushi. They have quite a few tables which is nice although there is often a wait if you're going at lunch time so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. I had the Shrimp Gyoza, Miso Ramen (with smoked egg of course) and Black Sesame Crème Brûlée and I loved every bite. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"I was in the downtown core doing business . An happened to come across this Japanese restaurant an thought why not try it . Mike the bartender explained some different options an glad I went with his choices . The music is just right so one can talk an yet enjoy ones surroundings ."}
{"text":"Ramen, to me, is comfort food. Hakata-style in particular reminds me of getting cozy and warm on a cold night, consuming noodles in a dark ramen bar in or Fukuoka riverside yatai that is almost silent, save for the enthusiastic slurping from the diners.

GORO+GUN has finally translated to Albertans what real ramen should taste like, from the perfectly porky broth and chewy noodles to their rendition of tamago: a perfectly oozy, smoked egg. Savoury and creamy, their well-balanced (and MSG-free) broth is incredible, but then again, I'm a shio fan through and through. 

The presentation is a little fancy-schmancy for my tastes, and some of the pricing is a bit eyebrow raising ($3 for an egg, which is absolutely essential in any bowl of ramen, in my opinion) but make no mistake, this is soup for the soul. I hope their robata and yakitori items are as wonderful as their soups. 

I'm so happy that G+G has successfully introduced what ramen culture SHOULD be like to Calgary, and cannot wait for a night of frosty draught brews and soup slurping!

(Also, their takeout system is fabulous. They packaged my husband's ramen up for my trip home to Canmore, and nothing was soggy, tough, or too far gone to consume. Just reheat the broth, pour over the noodles and add the toppings. Perfect.)"}
{"text":"Not the worst Ramen but not the best! The broth didn't have enough flavor.  Pork Belly seemed undercooked. 

The service was better than expected considering when we called to inquire about a reservation the lady on the phone was pretty rude. 

Doubt I'd ever eat here again."}
{"text":"GORO + GUN RAMEN is a Japanese Restaurant, which contemporary eatery serving sushi rolls, ramen soups & Japanese mains such as BBQ teppanyaki. By accident, I found this restaurant in the Core Mall downtown Calgary on last Wednesday and had a quick lunch there.

Environment:

I arrived restaurant around 12 pm, which was right at the lunchtime. There were so many people in the restaurant. I had to wait for a table outside the restaurant about 10 to 15 mins. After a while, the server took me inside the restaurant. The restaurant designed into two parts dining and bar. since it was super busy. I had to sit on the bar side of the restaurant. The restaurant was very nice and clean. Inside the restaurant had modern style design. It was a very fancy restaurant.

Service:

After I sat down, the server guy brought the menu and water to me. He was very nice and friendly. He has provided a very helpful suggestion for me to order.

Food & Prices :

TONKOTSU RAMEN for lunch.  It was a little bit pricey around $ 13. The ramen was including pork belly, red ginger, arugula, fried onions, and pork broth. After waiting about 5 mins, my food came out of the kitchen. It was in a big fancy bowl. Looks like it's a very small portion of food. However, I felt super full after I ate them all. The soup was very tasty.

In summary, It was my best ramen experience in Calgary so far. Even though it was expensive, it was very nice to have a try in the new restaurant."}
{"text":"Here for happy hour and  a super late lunch or early dinner? Lunner or loppers? I stood at the front for awhile waiting to be seated as the sign said. I waited for literally a good 5 mins before I had enough and walked to one of wait staff who was busily cleaning an empty space. I thought she noticed me standing there as I made eye contact. 

I was seated at the  bar as per my request as I was dining alone. I ordered 3 of their $5 specials. Tomo rolls, ramen burger, and the tuna poke. I also ended up having 2 glasses of their house red for $5/gl. For $5 each, the food made up for the initial greeting or should I say lack of greeting. 

The tuna poke was delish but only came with one wonton chip so I had to ask for another. The Tomo roll was a generous portion of 8 maki sized pieces which I was not expecting. The ramen burger came with 2 little sliders which consisted of ramen noodles as buns and beef patties with kimchi. Interesting concept I must say and it was actually good, just a little too saucyyyyyy cause it was dripping. I asked for a wet nap and the bartender was happy to tend to my needs. 

Would definitely come for happy hour again. 3 Stars this time due to initial lack of greeting but maybe a 4 four next time if they step it up with service."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen! We started with Lamb Gyoza dumplings with sesame sauce, which were a winner. I had the Kunoichi cocktail which has dragon fruit, vodka, strawberry nigiri and Campari float. (It's not a strong Campari taste this is a very sweet fruity drink). 

I had the Spicy Cold Seafood Ramen, which is almost too beautiful to eat. It's so delicious and the flavors are deep and layered. It's got no broth, but the sauce is amazing.

My hubby had the Mazemen Ramen which he loved. It's a more basic Ramen but again no broth.  He had a Saki cocktail which was described to him as a unique adventure. It had a slightly smoky level to its flavor layers, I tasted it. Winner, winner!"}
{"text":"Who can say no to $5.00 happy hour appetizers? Sounds like a pretty decent deal to me so after trying to get into a few other places for lunch (Woodshop closed and Local's patio was shut down for a private event), we decided to give Goro + Gun a go. My sister's been before for dinner and wasn't overly impressed so I came in with mild expectations.

We dropped in on a Monday afternoon and only three tables were occupied with customers. Makes sense as it was a work weekday. The interior is spacious but has a very clean, modern look to it that is consistent throughout the restaurant. If you want to see the layout, take a look at Dennis's review and pictures.

The $5.00 happy hour special goes from 3:00-6:00pm. We arrived a bit early but had to wait until 3pm to put in our order (according to our waitress, they can't input it in earlier because of their computer systems).

- Tuna poke - albacore tuna, avocado, seaweed in a sweet sesame dressing. Poke is probably one of my favourite things in the world. If you're traveling in Hawaii, make sure you eat some. Everyday. Goro + Gun's version was pretty good. The albacore tuna tasted pretty fresh and was nicely seasoned.
- Tomo's house roll - the house roll was surprisingly decent. 8 pieces of sushi consisting of beef and cucumber with a mayo and sweet sauce drizzled over top.
- Smoked fresh fish tataki - lightly hay smoked fresh seasonal fish, ground citrus sauce and garlic chips. Yum, this was another tasty dish. The toasted garlic chips gave it a nice crunchy element.
- Ramen burger - fried noodle \"bun\", wagyu beef, unagi sauce, kimchi and garlic mayo. I've seen the ramen burger at several places now - these were miniature versions. Thank god. The wagyu beef was incredibly tender and the combo of the kimchi, unagi sauce and garlic mayo gave it a nice creamy texture. Maybe it's just me but I'm not a fan of ramen burgers. Way too much noodle to meat ratio. Half the amount of noodles would be ideal.
- 2x Featured sashimi - 7 pieces total of sockeye salmon, tuna, toro and shrimp. This was probably our least favourite of the appetizers that we ordered. I guess you can't expect $5 sashimi to be good. The sashimi was small and wasn't the best quality.
- Spicy satay prawn - covered with a peanut satay sauce and green onions. These come breaded so my sis couldn't indulge meaning I had to eat these all. They had a slight kick to it but I wouldn't call these spicy. There could have been more satay too.

Based solely on their $5.00 happy hour specials, I would come back if I was in the area. I've heard and read mixed reviews on their ramen so I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to come here for ramen. Still, it's a solid option if you want some appetizers and cheap drinks on a weekday. Did someone say club going up on a Tueeeesssday?"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I have no other words! The quality surpasses a lot of any other establishments"}
{"text":"The ramen is okay.  The broth is alright, its not as flavourful as other ramen restaurants; my only complaint is that the broth is never that hot.  I've tried the Mazemen, Spicy Cold Seafood,  Miso Kim Chi and the Spicy Lamb.  All of them are pretty decent. There isn't really any ramen options in the Core and its usually pretty easy to get a reservation.  My must have when I dine here is the smoked egg. It's worth it; if you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for a work lunch.  Very easy to get a reservation through the online Yellow Pages site.  

I ordered the Tonkotsu with extra noodles and the chili sauce on the side.  As many other reviews noted, the broth is not piping hot as it should and I dislike the fact that egg is an add-on.  I also found the broth to be a bit bland and not as thick/creamy as it should be.  The pickled ginger was a nice touch.  I found the chili sauce to be a little one note (just spice), however my companion liked the chili sauce so probably just a matter of preference.  Halfway through the bowl, I noticed that I had no sesame seeds and everybody else at the table did.  So it seems consistency is an issue and makes me wonder what other toppings and additions were missed (which would explain the bland broth).

I miss \"The Ramen by Globefish\" which used to be downtown.  This place is ok, however I prefer Hapa Izakaya if you are located further west and don't mind walking outside.  The egg is not an add-on there :)"}
{"text":"I have to agree they do have pretty good ramen here. My colleague recommended this place. Its located inside a mall on the second floor. 

I got the miso ramen with smoke egg. The miso ramen is definitely very different from what I have back in Vancouver. The taste is very unique. I like the noodle. Its nice and firm. The smoke egg was amazing. Its a whole egg. So outside is brown and inside is liquidly. 

The décor of the restaurant is very trendy. It is somewhat dark inside. Also, I have noticed a lot of spicy options. 

Service is ok. I mean we sat at the bar and so we did have a server. She would come check on us every so often. 

Overall, I liked the restaurant and the food. Would come again since I work quite close to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the ramen burgers here.

Goro and gun is located downtown Calgary shopping centre. Parking is easy and finding the restaurant also a breeze. 
Came here during the weekday and decided to stop in after an afternoon of heavy duty shoppin. 

We were greeted and seated fairly quickly
Closer to the washrooms then I would of like but it was rather busy and I didn't want to be one of those people lol. 

What we ordered: 
Tuna sashimi - delicious and fresh 
Ramen burgers- one of my favourites 
Ramen - spicy lamb - not bad but I've had better ramen. 

Overall: 
Atmosphere 4/5 I love the concept and feel of this restaurant very trendy. Causal quick serve 

Food 3.5-4 : they just need to work on the ramen. 
 
Service: 4/5 attentive and friendly.

Repeat: yes next time I'm in downtown Calgary and craving ramen."}
{"text":"Ramen pork belly sliders! Caught your attention? Good, because they caught mine too. They were on special for happy hour when I met a friend for drinks here after work one day.

Goro + Gun, IMO, is an improvement on what was once a gigantic 3 floor bar that was never all that full, nor impressed me enough to keep coming back. My favourite part of our visit was drinking sake out of a little square bamboo cup (can you call it a cup if it's square?). Your server will bring it over and pour it out over the glass and into the cup for you. Watch for leaks, my first cube had one, very minor, but you don't want to lose any of that precious liquid! Hot or cold, you can have your sake either way.

There are plenty of booths to hold you and your friends, though I haven't tried the full menu, this would on my list of after work go-tos downtown for an enjoyable experience and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing based on my first impression after only one visit.

The Positives:
Very good Sake Selection. (Not HUGE, but very decent choices available - if not slightly overpriced, but then again imported liquor...so...yeah)
The MOST delicious smoked/spiced pork for a Ramen that I have tasted outside of Osaka.
Creme Brulee is AMAZING
$5 happy hour specials on more than just 1 or 2 items!
Nice open, airy, casual atmosphere.
Casual easy service, no rushing here. (many people have commented on service but we found it to be just right for a relaxing early evening weeknight meal)

The Negatives:
MUSIC IS WAY TOO LOUD, We had to basically shout at each other to communicate.
Tonkotsu Ramen Broth was pretty watery and thin, while tasty it's not the amazingly umami, thick delicious broth that I've come to know and expect for a tonkotsu broth. (almost as if it was cooked without pork bones??)
Broth was not hot. It was served room temperature. It wasn't bad - but not great. 
Noodles were a little too thin for my liking. (I much prefer South Osaka style ramen)
I didn't get spring onions on my tonkotsu, instead it was arugula. Although it wasn't horrible - it wasn't right. (a little too western \"fusion\" for my taste)  
Ramen doesn't really come with the right toppings. You can order a smoked egg (+$3)
Or Bamboo Shoots (+$1) etc. etc. But no corn, or fish cake, or other things that should be included as add ons or even just included in the price of the bowl.

I think I'll be back to try their other offerings...but for Tonkotsu Ramen so far Muku still can't be beaten!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?

- Ambience is beautiful. black, white, red, it's modern and yet somehow a bit quaint.
- Watching the kitchen work is super fun (also a plus when they actually have a japanese staff!)
- The TV is always playing some weird anime (spirited away usually) or Jiro dreams of sushi. The first time I was here, they were playing some Japanese drama based around a ramen cook. perfection.
- Happy Hour is ridiculous. My only complaint with Goro and Gun is that the food is a bit expensive on its regular menu. Happy Hour is the answer, apps all $5, Sapporo and Sake to at $5 a pop. Get drunk, get full. All good.
- Ramen is fantastic. Favourite in the city."}
{"text":"Stunningly good.. I went at around 11:20 to beat the DT lunch crush. Got the ramen with kimchi and pork belly and added a smoked egg. Absolutely blow-me-away delicious. The noodles were the most perfect texture of any ramen I've had anywhere- in Calgary, in Vancouver, in Hawaii, in Singapore, anywhere. Huge serving, delicious broth, lovely piles of meat and kimchi- I could go on and on. Very, very special place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a vendor during the week, and noticed this place.   Absolutely love ramen noodles (Ramen Santoku in Vancouver is my benchmark) so thought I'd give this place a shot. 

Price wise, it's on the high side.  There's not much pork with the ramen, the broth (shio) was just okay, nothing too special as it wasn't very creamy, and there was no egg.  Good thing I added the smoked egg ($4!!) which was probably the highlight of the meal, just slightly soft in the middle.   

For downtown ramen I guess your choices are limited, but I don't think I'll ever go back here for ramen, unless another vendor pays for it.  I will say though, the venue is quite nice!"}
{"text":"Okay so I have been here only once and it was for lunch but I am coming back. The service (waitress) was fine though our hostess was curt and cocky. The location is perfect if you are downtown and already have parking or took the train. The restaurant itself is fun and equipped for a small group in a booth or a large group at a large slab of a table. Probably a great opportunity  to socialize if you are one or two and want to interact with another one or two as well. It is fairly loud which I did not mind but my lunch companion found challenging. The main reason for my return is quite frankly the food. It is a refreshing change of pace in presentation and in combined ingredients. There is a $5 happy hour that features fun Japanese tapas (for lack of a better word right now) and there are specials. Ever had lamb Gyoza? Or something called a \"tuna poke\"? Both options here as well as a smoked version of fish tataki. Mmmm. Prices are what one would expect downtown but considering a bento box is $14 I wouldn't be complaining. Check it out next time you find yourself near the Scotia Tower."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! I went there during their happy hour, and i enjoyed it so much! Their promo prices are very reasonable, and all their food are perfectly cooked and plated. I had ramen on my first visit together with my friends , and we loved it! I like the modern ambience of the whole restaurant including the open kitchen. The servers are very helpful and friendly :)"}
{"text":"The food is great here and the service I've always found to be fantastic.  It's priced a tad bit on the high side but hey, it's downtown."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was very good, service was very friendly and fast enough considering it was lunch time .. I didn't have drinks but the food was not bad... Desserts were just ok, unimpressive burnt Terrible .... I would definitely go back ..."}
{"text":"First time dining at this Japanese noodle bar with my partner. The atmosphere is nice - clean and modern with a hint of Japan decor. Great for coming with friends or your partner on a date.

We got the Tonkotsu Ramen ($12) and a roll of Seared Salmon Roll ($16). The ramen was great, soup base was made well, the noodle had the right consistency (not too soft, not too hard, Just Right!). The BBQ pork bone was tasty as well. On the contrary, the seared salmon roll was alright - wasn't that interesting (I think the combination of lobster, crab, salmon, cheese, onion is not my choice). We would probably try another roll next time."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in all of Calgary. The food is absolutely amazing. The entire restaurant has a great atmosphere and mood. I love the spicy tuna roll and any of the kinds of ramen. Some of the times I've been, I haven't had the absolute best service. However, I still think that the quality and taste of the food still just makes it my favourite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Overall it's ok - I think there are better ramen places out there for the price, however, the food itself is good. I come here once in a while for lunch with co-workers, but it's not the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Ramen!"}
{"text":"Goro and Gun is awesome. I had great experience with the service and the food was better than expected. Rainbow Roll, Unagi Roll, and Spicy Lamb Ramen were all hits."}
{"text":"Tried the Shio Ramen and it was OK.  The bowl of ramen noodles & tonkatsu broth was on the small side.  I know my tonkatsu soup and this broth was more of the gourmet style of the traditional Japanese way of making tonkatsu.  I still prefer Muku's  in terms of the taste of the broth and the portion size.  The noodles was kinda pricey.  If I do go back, I'll try other items but their ramen is so-so.  I also got the smoked egg and the waitress forgot it but brought it out a little late.  The egg was all right.  I think too much of a smoky taste for me that ruined the ramen and tonkatsu for me.   

Customer service was pretty good."}
