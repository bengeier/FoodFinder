{"text":"Finding a truly great cheesesteak in Glendale AZ is hard. Like, alarmingly hard, especially for a sandwich whose name starts with 'Philadelphia.

This place serves a truly great cheesesteak with fresh bread, chopped meat, and tangy salty gooey cheese. It is a magnificent trifecta! 

Also had the cold Italian. It was also delicious!

I am happy to have this friendly and family owned deli in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"At the time of this review Phila Deli is a brand new business. This is a small casual restaurant that serves Cheesesteaks and Hoagies. You order at the counter and they bag up your order to go. They do have five tables for seating. Everything inside is clean and fresh and decorated with Philadelphia Memorabilia, Rocky and Boxing Gloves. This restaurant is located on 59th ave in Glendale in a strip mall by where a soon to open Gym is coming where Albertsons's used to be.

The sandwiches here have TONS OF POTENTIAL! It might be due to a few opening hiccups that I can't honestly rate a higher star. The fillings for the Cheesesteak and Chicken Steak are VERY GOOD and very much above average. Very TENDER, FLAVORFUL meats. They use sliced Ribeye and Chicken. The chicken is actually better than what you would get in Philadelphia. They do the steak sandwich Geno's Style and Not Pat's. What that means is that the steak isn't all chopped up. They cook it till tender on the grill, add the cheese and it goes facedown on the bread. It sort of melts in. The tomato sauce they offer is also VERY GOOD. They make it and it's delicious. Our sandwiches were really packed!

We both thought pricing was very reasonable for such large sandwiches with the quality it was.

The owner is very hospitable. Yesterday a customer came in with young children that the mother wanted to buy snacks for. The young child didn't know if she liked cheese puffs so the owner just ripped a bag open and offered the child a cheese puff to taste. You just don't come across people that nice very often. The owner even said she could have a brand new bag and didn't have to take the opened bag.

The opening hiccups - the peppers.
The owner is aware that they don't have the correct peppers for the sandwiches yet. Correct peppers are Hot and Mild Cherry Peppers. At the moment they offer Pepadews and Jalape√±os. I don't know if they will change the peppers at some point. Sandwiches were still tasty with the pepadews.......

The MAIN hiccup is the bread.
It's difficult to get the right bread in Arizona. The bread that was used yesterday deteriorated and couldn't hold up to the Steak sandwich fillings. If they change their bread I WILL INDEED up my rating.

3 stars is not a poor rating. It means A-OK on Yelp. 
An A-OK rating is mostly positive I just have some reservations (mainly the bread).

Lots of potential here! 

3.5 stars - slightly above 3 for above average chicken & steak sandwich filling"}
{"text":"Very good cheesesteak. Went with the wiz which some from philly would say is traditional. I found it pricey but if that is real ribeye then it was actually a good price. This is a brand new business so give it a try. I split a large with my wife and that was a reasonable size."}
