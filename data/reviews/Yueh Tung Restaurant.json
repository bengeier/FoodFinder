{"text":"Great chili chicken!  Chow mein is good too. Lunch deals are best value... Go for chili chicken on rice."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service.  Server was rude and when I received the wrong meal that I had ordered he proceeded  to tell me that I was wrong and that I had indeed ordered a regular chilli chicken as opposed to the Manchurian. Chicken was mediocre and not as good as everyone raves about. Server also brought out the bill and I had not even finished my meal as yet (mind you the restaurant was in NO way busy as there were only 2 other tables) when I had asked him why he brought it when I hadn't had asked he couldn't even respond back to me. I will NOT be returning to this poor establishment."}
{"text":"PRO- The food I ordered was ABSOLUTELY amazing. I myself would go back everyday if I could. The quality of the food was phenomenal.   Cons- I went with a vegetarian friend and her options were not good. They do not cater much to vegetarians. Also note that they literally charge your for everything. So if you order a chicken dish, expect to pay for the steam rice as well. We ate at this establishment during our recent vacation to Toronto. The service was good however beware that they do not speak very good English. Go over everything you order because you will get stuff you did not order in additional to your order because of the language barrier. One waiter (not our designated waiter) came over to take our order and he did not understand ANYTHING we said. Finally our waiter came back. If you can over look these things then you MUST eat at this place."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! Our server Michael was so helpful and friendly. We had the crispy beef and it was the best I've had. Definitely recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was born! ( 20 + years ) This place has become our go to spot for many years. We practically celebrate every occasion here and my family could possibly be their biggest fans.   Aside from the love and loyalty we have to this place.. there are some things people should know.   - The area is not the greatest on parking due to being downtown and in a small street.  Be prepared to find parking on busy nights and to pay downtown pricing which is the norm !   - The place is upstairs and they have no accessibility for wheel chairs etc Their elevator has never run (as far as we know) so lots of stairs!   - No changing tables! This has been an inconvenience many times with all the babies But we've managed !   Overall a great restaurant and their ginger lobster is a must have!!! Food also comes in sharing portions and good price!  Don't overlook it, It might even become your go to place !"}
{"text":"What do you say to scrumptious cheap food that will result in leftovers for next-day lunch? HELL YA! Yueh Tung, is the best Hakka Chinese(Indian influenced Chinese) place I have been to in the city. The Chilli Chicken, Manchurian Beef, the Chow-mein are all delicious, spicier than normal and a flavour explosion in your mouth. Be prepared for a lot of garlic-y flavours. The price can't be beat at around $10 for a family sized serving easily enough for 3-4 people, the rice or noodles will cost you extra though. The main dining room is HUGE and excellent for groups without a reservation even, its acceptably clean but not great in terms of ambiance. The bathrooms are a bit sketchy. But the food easily makes up for all that."}
{"text":"Avoid at lunchtimes due to sheer chaos, but this place is a greasy, spicy treat.   It's one of my favourite places downtown for Chinese/Hakka food.  Try ordering a \"Dried Chilli Fish with Fried Rice\" for a delicious spicy & crispy dinner/lunch.  The hot and sour soup is also the best I've ever had.  The chicken pakoras are very different from places like Lin Garden or Fredericks, but very tasty in their own way... almost like Hakka KFC nuggets o chicken or something.   A guilty pleasure worth indulging. Love going here but my arteries probably don't."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been going to this place for years now and it never gets old.  They recently renovated and while the changes to regulars are subtle, I'm sure new customers will appreciate the decore more.  The big upgrade for me was the washrooms!  While I've seen some negative reviews on the service we've rarely had issues.  This place gets BUSY at lunch with the work crowd and the services can get hurried but a little patience goes a long way.  The staff is personable, friendly, and we always have fun with them.  Though I haven't had a lot on the menu, I have to recommend the chili chicken.  Hands down an amazing dish.  The hot & sour soup is AMAZING as well.    If you're expecting high quality you won't get it here.  But the price is definitely right for what you get, which is a greasy but delicious Chinese food experience!"}
{"text":"The best chili chicken in town.  Love the chicken in hot pot as well.  Hakka Yueh Tung Special chow me in is awesome.  Also enjoyed their chicken balls - sweet & sour sauce is delicious.  Renovation is awesome and good never disappoints.  Been a customer since they were located across the road before the current condo was built."}
{"text":"I've had all versions of their \"hakka\" from those restaurants in Scarborough and I have to say I liked those better than Yueh Tung.  My reason why I like the others better? They cut their meats and only cook the pieces that are from the parts of chicken that we are used to eating most of the time, say a breast. I've tried the Chili Chicken that's always wet and their beef dishes. I haven't tried the Dry Chili Chicken like another reviewer mentioned below.  Yueh Tungs meats are all parts, including feet, skin, etc. I even saw nails, probably of the chicken.   If I'm not making sense - do me a favour and try the hakka restaurants like Lucky's in Scarborough.  The only thing Yueh Tung has got going for it is it's relatively nice decor."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food (chilli chicken is to DIE for), HUGE portions, and very affordable. Fortune cookie with your receipt, and sometimes freshly cut oranges as well.  This year, I've been to Yueh Tung around 3-4 days in a week. I've gone here so many times over the past couple of years, I'm on a first-name basis with the waiter.  Maybe I should change my last name to \"Yueh\", because this is one sexy restaurant."}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday about 2pm. The dining room was one-third full, but there was only one waitress who managed things well given the challenge. Tables were left messy for 30 minutes before being cleared and our waters were never refilled. In fact, the waitress did not bother to check in with us after taking our order. That being said, the food was pretty good. The spring rolls and the soups were excellent. The portions were large. Everything tasted fresh. We would not visit again until trying other Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"My family has been eating here for about 20 years and I absolutely love the place. The place has renovated twice since I was a ye ol' lad and went from a grimy dive to a family restaurant. The service is excellent because the servers do respond to your order as soon as they can.  I suggest getting the dinner menu if you're in a group as it gives you a big serving that can serve to about 3 to 4 people each dish (which is roughly around $10 a dish).  Even if it is \"dinner time\" you can still get a lunch menu for the best deal if you're dining solo.  If you like chicken you should try their Manchurian Chicken/Ginger Spice Chicken or Chicken Pakora. Those are their specialty and you won't find a restaurant anywhere in Toronto that can make it better."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious and the staff are very polite and funny. The only issue i have with this place is the interior. It needs updating."}
{"text":"I don't have anything positive to say about this place,as I visited today Dec 12,13.  There was no line up whatsoever but it seemed evident that no one was there to take our order. We had to literally flag someone down to take our order. Upon taking our order which took literally no more than 10 minutes we were advised they ran out of chicken.  Literally we sent about 20 minutes during our lunch hour to find out there was no chicken whatsoever at this place. Now this might sound weird but this has been the second time in about 1 year this has happened.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Update:  went back. I think they rehired the old kitchen staff!  The food is great once again.  :))"}
{"text":"Manchurian Chicken dry is my addiction. I wouldn't be surprised if the amount of times I have ordered this dish is in the hundreds. I'm bordering on an obsession. I was introduced to it by my high school friend back in the late 90s. For years I didn't even know he name of the restaurant, we just called it manchurian.   I like it so much that after my wife and I arrived back in Toronto from a foodie trip to NYC we headed straight to Manchurian. Think about that for a second. After eating tons of insane meals in NYC, we still wanted good old Manchurian Chicken. It definitely can hold its own versus some of the best foods I've had over the years.   The trick is to order it DRY. Ordering it normally (wet)  is ok,  but the magic of Manchurian Chicken can only truly be appreciated by getting it dry. I've heard rants about the chilli chicken and I think they are basically the same thing one just has more chilli but who knows. The only way one could figure it out is to order both and that's basically taking space in my belly away from Manchurian so that will never happen.  The staff is way above average when compared to any basic Chinese restaurant. Some of them are actually pretty funny if you start up a conversation. They are also very quick and attentive. The new decor is great but I was so used to how it looked before that it never bothered me but I can see why they did the renovations.   If you want a great affordable meal in the downtown core and don't want to go to a fancy or trendy place Yueh Tung is easily the best choice."}
{"text":"Best chili chicken in town.   Always a line up at1:1 lunch, so i usually opt for takeout.  Service is fast (and furious.  Lol), and portions are generous.  If you're still hungry after a plate, then you're a superstar!  Oh, the hot and sour soup is really good too.  Youre best bet to avoid lineups is to get there at 11:40 or after 1:30."}
{"text":"Renovated in end-2013, the restaurant is now much cleaner and comfortable, in line with the feel of House of Gourmet and King's Noodle at Spadina and Dundas.  The food is decent as it has been for the price you pay and merits repeat visits.  Hakka food served in 3 styles: Traditional, Indian and Cantonese. You won't go wrong with the stir-fry dishes here.  Gets a 4-star now that the restaurant is clean and new with affordable prices."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been coming here since 1998. The quality is still awesome. The chilli chicken is the best on the planet. They renovated recently too and the place looks really nice now. I wish i lived or worked downtown so i could go more often."}
{"text":"Food is always solid, the Manchurian chicken is amazing, portions are large, prices are reasonable, and now it actually looks quite nice inside as the renovation is complete.  I don't think they raised the prices after the reno which is a big plus.   It's definitely my favourite chinese restaurant downtown, much more civilized than anything in Chinatown and cheaper and less pretentious than Crown Princess.   They also do great takeout and it's on a side street so it's easy to stop the car and run in."}
{"text":"Quite a busy lunch place. My friend took me here. Luckily I was able to sneak away from work for more than an hour (a rarity) as quite the wait for a table. I had the Spicy Chili Chicken. Not too spicy but not bad. Ordered it mixed with rice and Chinese Brocoli. I would go back again. Restaurant was clean. Lots of hustle and bustle. Typical Chinese fast food restaurant. I agree. Brightly lit. Located on the second floor on the corner"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for years and I love it. The waiters and waitresses are super nice and friendly. And the food is amazing!! The cuisine is Hakka Chinese food and my favourite dish is the chili chicken! A little spicy for those that can't take spice but it always satisfies my belly!  I've dined in a couple of times and also had take out and the food is just as good either way. I will definitely be a life time diner here.   Thanks Yeuh Tung!"}
{"text":"Ordered Manchurian Beef, Chili Chicken and Beef with Black Bean sauce for lunch with our 4 boys.  Manchurian Beef was amazing, Chili chicken was a hit with our kids who found it tasty without too much spiciness.  The Beef and Black Bean sauce though tasted abit too strong for us - could have just been that particular day though. I think they roast the black beans first so the flavour was stronger than we prefer. There was a slight miscommunication and a different plate had come out than the black bean sauce.  But the server was quick to bring the correct order with an honest apology, and the owner also came around making sure we were enjoying our meal.  That says alot for a chinese restaurant.  Final verdict is that we would come again, vary the order alittle as it was abit lopsided (our own choice though).  The ambiance was casual and comfortable and service experienced was excellent.  Parking could be challenging it looks like, but definitely worth coming back."}
{"text":"Ignore the menu. Order the chilli chicken on rice. You won't be disappointed. Trust me."}
{"text":"I have come here many times for the chili chicken. I love it, simply addicting. It is spicy hence the chili, but they have other dishes that you will like as well."}
{"text":"the restaurant is no more at the address. It took me half hour to find the place?and when i got there its all empty? It is closed now."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese store. Good beef tenderloin, and soups. They have a large menu and fast service. The place looks very nice after the renovation that happened within the last few years. Their is parking on the street or at the parking lot at chestnut. It is paid parking however."}
{"text":"Used to have very good food before the renovation, but now the menu and the way of cooking has changed. Not tasty as used to be. They might have changed their cooks I think. Hopefully they go back to hire the same cooks."}
{"text":"Chili chicken or chili chicken wings. You will never go wrong.  I like it with rice or noodles. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Best chilli chicken ever! Don't be fooled by how empty it seems sometimes - it's a Toronto favourite. Definitely try the chili chicken on a sizzling plate."}
{"text":"Pretty decent! I initially the thought it'll be a dingy place but the place and ambience is very good and clean. Service is super fast and decent price. I liked the chili chicken chow mein, worth the price. Quantity is a lot. I believe enough for two or maybe three people. Good food!"}
{"text":"I have long been a patron of this restaurant.  To beat the lunch rush get there for 1150. Two items that I highly recommend you try: 1) hit and sour soup - shrimp, pork, tofu, peas, and a terrific broth (sometimes I add hot sauce or vinegar for flavour; and 2) chili chicken on a sizzling plate - the non sizzling version is good too but trust me the one on the sizzling plate is dynamite. The Manchurian chicken is great too. The lunch specials are a good deal too although I never eat the full order of rice because it's so much."}
{"text":"After a 7 course dinner last night, you think I would slow down on my caloric intake and have something \"healthy\" for lunch.  Yeah, right.  Deep fried pork chops with spice and pepper and simple egg fried rice, come to papa!  The pork chop dish takes a bit longer than others to prepare.  But let me tell you, it was worth the wait.  Crispy pork with chili and onion, oh man, completely satisfying.  I can't think of anything else that would compliment the pork chop than a simple fried rice.  The smokey flavor from a hot wok and crunchy vegetable pieces, talking about comfort food.  Um, um, um ... good!"}
{"text":"Location is not very accessible, compared to an average restaurant. It seems there is an elevator but it's closed off. So the flight of stairs might be a problem for some.   The noodles we ordered were way too sweet. The eggplant was par for the course. Overall both dishes very greasy, maybe it's the lighting in there but the food had quite a shiny image.  The service was very quick and attentive."}
{"text":"i've been to this hakka place a handful of times - they're consistently good - i enjoy their food, usually get the shrimp pakoras, chili chicken/manchurian chicken, beef fried rice and chicken corn soup. their servings are family style and large portions, so tons of leftovers.  the service it not the best, and the actual restaurant is a bit run down, there's this distinct smell that's always around, damp carpet smell (ick) so i would recommend takeout rather than dine-in. the place is usually always crowded on the weekends and there's a line-up.  they're location is convenient, dundas/yonge - so if i'm craving hakka in the city then i usually go here - although i think its time to find another hakka place... this place is good enough, cheap and whets the appetite...just dont mind the eating conditions..."}
{"text":"This place is closed for months.  Poor planning on the closure dates and re opening.   The owner should give their valued customers a re opening party."}
{"text":"They recently did some renovations at Yueh Tung and re-opened in December 2013. New carpet, tables,  lighting, tea pots. The place looks much better than before. They put on a grand-reopening special and were packed so the service was a little slower for a lunch; but understandable for the first day open, after being closed for around 3 months.  I have added a star because the food that came was always tasty, portioned generously, and a good value. Now they have updated and cleaned up the dining room which makes it a better experience.  I tried manchurian chicken because it was on the grand-reopening specials menu. It was good and might be an option for someone looking for something less spicy than chilli chicken; but I still prefer my chilli chicken dry with chinese broccoli on the side. It's my once a week work-lunch treat!"}
{"text":"I was back there yesterday and had Veg and beef soup Man size and oh boy it was soooo good."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, and was usually very happy with the food and price. This reveiw is for today's lunch...  I recommend staying away Friday's at lunch-- it progressively went from meh to bad... 1.  Line up was atrocious but waited patiently- somewhat expected on a Friday lunch 2.  Got the food~ dry chili chicken with chinese broccoli which looked great, but stone cold- not exagerating unfortunately. 3.  Told the server who took it away, only to return a few minutes later with the same food microwaved- not cool. 4.  Ate the burn- my- mouth- not- so- good -food. Can't believe a restaurant would do that, even if it is the middle of a rush. I really wonder if I will go back.  Stay away during busy times or if you send food back specify you want it fresh, not microwaved and you should be ok."}
{"text":"we ordered chilli chicken and schzewan shrimp..and ordered it to be extra spicy. Food came out in 4 minutes and both were disgusting and sweet. It was so slimy, made me want to vomit. Obviously, this isn't my first time eating these dishes, but it was my first time here, and never will I ever come back again.  *excuse me while I go throw up my food*"}
{"text":"Yueh Tung is an average Chinese restaurant with a slight Hakka flair. It's heavy on flavour, but mostly on salt and chili sauce that somehow isn't spicy.  I tried the Manchurian Chicken and I liked how under the sauce, the chicken was nice and crispy, but I didn't think the sauce tasted particularly great.  Also had the Chili Beef, which had a sauce on it that looked different from the manchurian chicken but actually tasted about the same.  For lunch, dishes are all around $7 and you will definitely not leave hungry, although I didn't leave with any leftovers either. The dishes are almost all served on rice. The service is efficient, but not attentive."}
{"text":"Chili Chicken is Godly.    Substitute rice with crispy egg noodles for $1 extra if you feel like treating yourself."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things so I decided to go the other day for lunch with a buddy of mine. There was a lineup to get seated but we didn't wait for more than five minutes. We got a window seat which was nice but there was only one little menu for the both of us....not cool. Oh well, I got chili chicken with rice and my friend got chicken and vegetable with rice. My plate came about 15 min after ordering, however my friend wasn't too lucky. He had to wait 45 minutes for his food!! It wasn't even busy anymore, the lunch rush had died out and more than 50% of the seating area was empty. It's not like we sat there unsuspecting either, we kindly asked our server a few times where the rest of our order was....she would always say \"It's coming.\"  Obviously I was not impressed at all with the service one bit. I'm not too sure what could have gone wrong for the second dish to take so long to make. I understand shit happens sometimes so I will go back and give it another shot. The food was simply outstanding. I've had my fair share of chili chicken and this was the most tender and perfectly sauced chili chicken I've had! Damn you customer service for ruining potentially a great experience."}
{"text":"I have no idea what other reviewers meant to say when they said it's Hakka . It's not Hakka . It's a plan horrible Chinese place . I couldn't eat anything there and left all my food . Please don't waste your time and money . You will thank me later"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, low prices, decent menu selection.  Highly recommend...  if you can get a table during the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"This was the worst customer service experience ive ever had at any restaurant. I ordered a Manchurian fish chow mien, the waitress misunderstood me and thought I ordered Manchurian fish by itself. When I brought up this error with her, instead of apologizing and admitting her mistake, she blamed it on me and said the order was already made and refused to take it back or have it exchanged. I would have complained to her manager but she didnt speak English all that fluently and looked like an immigrant middle aged woman trying to make a living to feed her kids and reminded me of my mother so I didnt want to get her in trouble and make her lose her job. But Yueh Tung restaurant, if you read these reviews, please train your staff better and teach your staff what customer service is."}
{"text":"A decent place to satisfy a craving for hakka.   Tried the Manchurian Chicken and it was pretty good and the quantity was very large (made two meals from it). Will definitely try the Chilli Chicken next time.  PS: The restaurant is upstairs, so if you are walking on Dundas and see the sign be careful to not enter the Japanese restaurant under the sign by mistake. I did that and from the way the waitress responded I have a feeling more people had done that..."}
{"text":"Had the hot and sour soup and the chili chicken chow mein the soup was one of the blandest and least authentic I've tasted in toronto and I've tried 5 different places in the past week as I'm a big fan. the Noodles were not crispy as it should have been, was drenched in thick sauce, this where extra crunch noodles would help as it would not soak in the sauce as quickly and would become soggy. the chicken itself was tasty though. good price, but I wouldn't be back again for the chow mein."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, I was not impressed. Don't get me wrong, I love good, cheap, greasy, garlic/chilli-infused food, but Yueh Tung didn't do it for me. I went with my brother for Friday lunch at around 1:15pm. We were seated immediately, but our table was close to the door so there was a pretty bad draft. We ordered the Chilli Chicken and the Manchurian Chicken. What arrived were two heaping plates of rice and chicken-in-sauce slop. The chicken meat was terrible... tough and stringy. The sauce and chicken close to the top was cold so I had to dig down to get a few hot pieces of meat. I could probably deal with tough stringy meat if the sauce was to die for, but neither sauce was very interesting. The manchurian was a bit more interesting than the chilli. From the other reviews I was hoping for something more spicy, garlicky and flavourful. Oh well."}
{"text":"Normally, this is our favourite family restaurant but we had a not so good experience recently.  Our waitress seemed really unimpressed about serving us.  It was just not in keeping with the usual great staff personalities we have grown to love."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for years with friends and family and it is one of my favourite restaurants to go to. I swear their chili chicken has some kind of addictive drug in it because I can't stop ordering it! The prices are really good and the portions are more than enough (I eat A LOT).  I go to the restaurant so often that they know my name. That's saying a lot because I go to school downtown and am surrounded by so many restaurants to choose from.  Even when I'm surrounded by the amazing food downtown Toronto has to offer, I still end up going here the majority of the time.   Try the chili chicken. It's not that spicy."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets such great reviews. The chili chicken is good but there are other places that are better. The servers are abrupt and the food came out so quickly & it was cold...obviously they are cooking in mass quantities and not to order.  Will NOT go back."}
{"text":"My absolute go to place for Chinese Food for almost 20 years. Good food, fast service. Helps to know what you want."}
{"text":"We regularly order take out from here as it is very close to where we live. Their service is very quick, we get our food within 15 mins of calling them. Their chilli fish and chilli beef are so good! DH likes their chilli chicken and Manchurian chicken chow mein. This has been our go to Chinese place for almost 2 years now."}
{"text":"Had to try the chile chicken (dry) after reading so many great reviews.  Yueh Tung didn't disappoint.  The chicken was delicious: spicy with deep umami flavor.  As someone else wrote - this is addictive.  This dish rates five stars in my book.  However I also ordered Hakka yam nam mein, a tasteless mix of fried noodles and wontons (filled with poorly seasoned pork), accompanied by bits of roast pork.  What a ridiculous disappointment.  Absolutely try Yueh Tung for the marvelous dry chile chicken.  Forget the noodles."}
{"text":"Yeuh Tung serves up Toronto Chinatown classic dishes that I've grown to take for granted. The different chili chicken options and Cantonese favs alongside that beg for a good shot of soy sauce and that thin orangy-red hot sauce. The lightly battered peeled shrimp has always been a great memory for me, and the bitter melon stuffed with pork and shrimp was a treat. Located on the second floor, this is clearly an upscale restaurant decked out in efficient and friendly and attentive servers in their smart black and white uniforms. Long a favourite of Cantonese ex-pats in the city, you can tell it's run with care when the servers go out of their way to please. Interior has an updated old-school layout, sedate and relaxing, letting us settle in and get comfy in the medium-sized dark booths along the view out onto Elizabeth Street near the core of the city. The time capsule is real for me here with great flavours and textures from a Toronto institution. A significant part of my love affairs in and with Toronto involved this food and it continues to bring me joy. Next time I'm going to try the sizzling chili chicken on the platter, and as well some of the pakora chicken wings. Then there are some Manchurian items to check into. The menu is plenty long to have lots of variety to share. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I'm not of Hakka descent and I liked the food very much lol   The Hakka braised pork is a must, pork belly slices were cooked to perfection. Though it had a little bit greasy aftertastes."}
{"text":"When I'm downtown my goto for chili chicken is yu eh tung. Even though it has nothing on Scarborough locations,  sauce is pretty darn good. Good prices, decent service, good location. I'm giving this place 3 stars because I had some stomach issues 2x I've been here now."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. You get big portions for your money. The couple of things I don't like is..hard to park down there, if your not careful you will get a ticket,  and the other is you have to climb about 30 stairs, and to me they are steep."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant from since I was a little child. I have been there approximately 25 times, and every single time I have ordered the chili chicken. It's not so much the best chili chicken I have ever had, but it's so damn sentimental to me. The particular flavour has never changed over the years and when I eat it I'm transported back to my younger days.   The dish has always been very cheap which is a major +, roughly $7 for the chili chicken. I have taken some individuals there who thought the chili chicken was not all that, but to each their own. You either really like it, or you'll think it's meh, personally I would bathe in it."}
{"text":"So after seeing posts about this amazing chili chicken, I decided to check it out while waiting for a doctor's appointment. There are stairs leading up to this restaurant, so going down was a bit rough on my healing ankle. It was insanely packed for lunch, which I took as a good sign. I had to wait a few minutes before being seated, and was served some hot tea, and it was totally needed for a cold April day. I ordered the chili chicken with egg fried rice as my substitute. A huge plate promptly came with enough food for two people. Unfortunately there was zero kick to this dish, or much flavour. I tried to load it up with hot sauce, but even that tasted a bit old and stale. I was super disappointed that this did not live up to the hype, and would not recommend this dish, especially to those who love spicy food. The service was great though and it was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Pics look good but the food was not seasoned . Very bland and not flavorful at all. I ordered the BBQ duck and the Chill chicken. I was very disappointed. The prices are good but plate was full of rice and sauce. Skip this place."}
{"text":"A few friend of mine and I were hoping to take visiting parents out to try Hakka food for the first time. We know of a few good options around the city but for logistics reasons, we needed to find a good Hakka place downtown. Yelp gives Yueh Tung a decent rating and google reviews it better so we took a chance.  I'll start with the good, which is pretty much only the decor of the place. It's clean and the environment has a pleasing design and look.  Unfortunately that's all the good I have to say. The food was quite a disappointment. In a city with many many great Asian and International restaurants, it's actually rare to come across such mediocrity. The food wasn't terrible but it was so meh. Seriously meh! As we were a big group, we had a large spread of options and it was all so meh! We've all had the same dishes just about anywhere else but better.  While it wasn't so bad as to warrant giving the place a 1 rating, none of us saw any reason to ever go back and I can only suggest you pass as well. You could likely randomly walk into a place you've never been to in China town and fair better..."}
{"text":"I get take out food from here time to time. Decent food but not spectacular. I think I'm just not a Hakka food person (but somehow all my coworkers love it).  I ordered the Pakora Chicken Wings, expecting it to be spicy (as indicated on the menu), but it was not spicy at all. Actually, there wasn't much flavor.  Some of the other items my coworkers ordered tasted okay.  The chili chicken (supposedly what they're famous for) was decent.  Good friendly services. Reasonable prices but some things I find could be a little bit on the expensive side now (just noticed a recent price increase in some items).  I tend to prefer Hong Shing's (just down the street) style of food over this by just a bit), but it seems like just my preference.  Quality: 6.5/10. Services: 7/10. Value: 7/10. Overall 6.5/10 (not an average)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times after hearing they had great lunch special deals. And indeed, for $8 you get a massive plate of food.  You walk up a flight of stairs (or take an elevator?) and you'll find yourself facing a huge room. Someone will greet you eventually.  The place can get busy during lunch rush, and if you're coming in a small group (say, 2 or 3) you might be seated at a large round table with other small groups. But this isn't unusual; lots of chinese places do it. Of course, they will ask you whether you are willing to sit with strangers or continue to wait. Choice is good right?  Lunch menu comes with plenty of options that should satisfy most tastes or needs: lots of chicken, beef, pork, seafood, and vegetable dishes to choose from. There are spicy options and non-spicy options. You don't necessarily have to order off the lunch menu either; if you need some wonton soup or whatever just let them know and they'll make it for you.  Lunch specials come in a huge plate with rice covering half the plate and meat covering the other half. It's quite a generous portion of meat.  One thing to note is they tend to drench your dish in sauce, but you can ask for less or no sauce if you want more crunch on your meat.  The food is pretty average to me, but it tastes good and there's plenty of it so what's there to complain about? Perhaps lack of vegetables in a lot of the meat dishes, but if you're getting more meat in exchange for vegetables, not a problem, I can just bring my own bok choy."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend based on the strength of good Yelp ratings, and could not have been more disappointed. Every aspect of the experience was well below average.  To begin with, the service was awful - no one seemed interested in seating us, and the waiter never asked if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered a manchurian chicken and a beef fried rice. The manchurian chicken was served cold, but I never had the opportunity to tell anyone because the waiter never returned to our table after taking our order. The beef fried rice was at least served at the correct temperature, but was bland and not worth its price.  The place is kind of grimy overall. The menus we were given were tattered and dirty, and the plate I received for my food was not completely clean. I wish I could at least give this place 2 stars, but unfortunately I don't think they deserve anything more than one star for their effort and delivery. Yelp failed me here - the people giving this place 5 stars had a vastly different experience than I did."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times as it is a convenient meet up spot with friends working in different parts of downtown. It's a little hidden off the main Dundas street but it's also a bit of a hidden goodie. I believe they recently did a renovation. The places looks very modern and clean. Their food is authentic Chinese food and if you like spicy they make the best spicy dishes. I always order sweet and sour pork or chicken here as that is my go to dish. The portions were huge. I had to take out the rest for lunch the next day. Service is also really good. Staff were always circulating the restaurant. I will be back again in a month to get my Chinese food fix here."}
{"text":"The chilli and Manchurian chicken here is awesome. Im also a really big fan of their hot and sour soups and fried rice. haven't been here for awhile so when I came here last night i was surprised by their new nicely done Reno makeover. Service here is always on point and the staff is always extra friendly, even when their just taking your take-out order over the phone."}
{"text":"The good: The chili chicken and crispy beef. Great prices, and huge portions  The bad: Nothing. Everything I've had ranges from decent to great.  The ugly: They need to update that carpet!   I have to vehemently disagree with Mr. Vivek S here on the quality of their Chili Chicken.  Yueh Tung, in my humble opinion, has some GREAT Chili Chicken, maybe some of the best in Toronto.  You can order with sauce, or sans sauce (my choice), as per your liking, but each time I've been it's been delicious! It's usually not overly spicy, but just enough that I can enjoy my meal without needing a drink to sooth my palate.  The crispy beef is also done well. It's, well, crispy!  Also fairly sweet.   If you order dishes from the menu (not the lunch menu) the portions here are HUGE.  This is what Chinese food is about, large, family sized portions, so be prepared to share!   I've tried a few things here, the lobster sauce of rice, fried noodles, noodles in soup.  Everything is fairly average, except for the crispy beef and chili chicken."}
{"text":"I came here probably a few weeks back after my friend recommended it and said it had the \"best Chinese food.\" Being of Chinese background myself and never hearing of this place, I decided to give this place a shot.  Its not on Dundas but on the side and not eating in this area often, I was skeptical at first. The decor leading to the restaurant looked old but as soon as turned in, I was shocked at how new and modern the place looked.  It took us a while to order food but the waiter was patient with us and was very knowledgeable about the dishes. For example, I ordered a fried noodle dish and he came back to let us know that it is cooked with a lot of garlic. My friend and I didn't mind and were up to try the best Hakka dishes (this restaurant served Hakka-Chinese food). My friend ordered a tofu dish.  Our dishes came pretty quick. They were flavourful and portions were great.  Service WHILE dining wasn't as good. It took them a while to bring back more tea and water (and especially when you're eating Chinese food downtown, I DEFINITELY need the water ASAP #MSG). The ventilation didn't seem too good.  We ended up packing the leftovers to go. For a price of around $10-$13 each, it wasn't too bad. However, I do feel bad that I forgot to tip a reasonable amount.... (post exam and forgetting math already).    It was around 5pm on a Wednesday and I was surprised at the number of people walking in. It was fairly busy and when we left, it was just getting busier.  Also uploaded this on my Snapstory and was getting a lot of comments about how good it looked lol. ;) Maybe that'll give you gives motivation to try this place."}
{"text":"This is my absolutely favorite Hakka (Indian Chinese) restaurants. I've been going here since I used to visit Toronto on work years back and am a regular now when I live in Toronto. The staff know exactly what I want which isn't surprising - Chilli chicken rice with a side order of stir fried mix veggies with Tofu. Cannot.go.wrong. The flavors are amazing, the quantities are large and the service is quick. Chili chicken, the beef sizzler (forgot what it's called), the manchurian chicken...they have a ton of options most of which are a gift to your tongue (not always to your arteries). Yueh Tung is a city landmark for me."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  I've been here a few times and I keep coming back. They're quite accommodating for food allergies, but the only challenge is making sure they understand exactly what you're allergic to. There is a bit of a language barrier for some wait staff but others are very fluent, so it really depends on who you get.   I usually order a dish that normally comes battered and deep fried but I ask for it without batter to make it gluten-free. They usually will stir fry it with sauce or pan fry it with a dry rub, depending on what the dish is. Also make sure to ask if there is soy sauce in the dish. Many of the dishes don't have it, but some do. Everything is prepared in the same kitchen so cross contamination is possible. I've never had an issue though, but I don't have severe reactions to minor cross contamination.   Their portions are very generous and often I have a third to half of my meal packed up. The lunch menu in particular is a good deal with most dishes being under $10. They're quite popular though so if you want to get a seat make sure you get there 5-10 minutes before noon.  Only downside is due to the language barrier it can be difficult to communicate your dietary restrictions. Usually the cashiers speak English fluently so if your waiter doesn't understand what \"no breading\" means then just clarify with them. Sometimes also when they're packed they will say it's up to the chef to accommodate allergies since they're busy, but I've never had their chefs deny my request."}
{"text":"I've had my share of Hakka Chinese, but tried Yueh Tung b/c my girlfriend HIGHLY recommended it. The food was really good and the price was very affordable. The wait staff could have been a bit more friendly, but all in all it was a good evening.   If you like Hakka, try this place"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The staff are really friendly and the food is amazing.  The portion sizes are quite large so I usually get to take some home and it's quite cheap as well. I highly recommend the dry Manchurian chicken and any of the noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Got here 49 mins before 11pm (closing time) and was advised that there would be no additional customers seated because they \"were closing soon\"."}
{"text":"Veggies are not fresh. Mushroom are a bit sour and green peppers are a little bit bitter. Order meat dish please. Lunch is cheap."}
{"text":"If you are in downtown Toronto and want to grab some cheap lunch. This is the place to go. Lunch special is about $6.99 and they have like 30 items to choose from. From their famous chilli chicken to some crazy ass Chinese shit.   Just one advice. Stay away from this place during pay day. That will usually be Thursday or Friday :-) This place is like a zoo during those days."}
{"text":"This place was completely off my radar. I never knew it existed even though its probably a century year old. It's mixed in with a dozen of mom and pop restaurants, in which the types of cuisine are dizzying and difficult to keep up with. It's also off a side street, on the second floor of a building, sealed by thick giant doors. Nevertheless, I'm glad I know about it now and I'm glad I ordered the chili chicken.  Picture a clean, spacious and slightly modern. Chinese restaurant, with a combination of booth and table seating. Hard isn't it? To my surprise, I sat there, patiently, looking across such a place, as I described above, while reading a traditional Chinese menu. It was a great feeling. I hear its packed at lunch, which I can and can't believe. Can because the food is both delicious and fair priced, can't because the space is large and seating is ample.   The thing to get is chili chicken on sizzling plate and make it dry so its crispy instead of the wet version which is saucier and less crispy. Order a bowl of plain white rice to tone down the spiciness and to also mute some of that robust flavour it packs. The combo will make you the happiest camper on the block. Not a fan of any sort of heat (I'd rate this a 6 out of 10 for heat)? maybe stick with any of the classics like the Cantonese chow mein. I had that too, noodles were crispy as they should be and topping was normal too. Nothing to write home about though, keep that pen in your pocket. But chili chicken and I bet, other items on the special menu are definite winners.  After 12 bucks you go home super full and satisfied. Overall, its a clean, spacious restaurant with good prices and decent service.  I am craving chili chicken right now. Rumours have it, Carlos Delgado (baseball all-star) used to come here and order three plates of chili chicken all to himself. I can understand why, but I hope he had rice too. Its a bit salty otherwise."}
{"text":"Our group of 5 came past 9PM on a Wednesday night, and the restaurant was almost entirely empty.   That's a good thing since I'm used to brusque, Chinese service trying to get you moving on as fast as possible to get more diners in. Instead, the service was patient and prompt, and we had a pleasant, peaceful meal.  We ordered their specialty, the Chili Chicken on a sizzling plate, and really enjoyed that. I think it's the unique item that makes it a Hakka restaurant unlike every other Chinese place around. We also got the Crispy shrimp and chefs special sweet sour sauce (also good), Hakka tofu (comes out slower but also tasty, and Canadian broccoli (standard and fine).  I consider myself hard to impress when it comes to Chinese food since most of it is pretty standard, but I think Yueh Tung really stood out to me. You could order the normal dishes and have a good meal, but they actually had unique items on the menu that I enjoyed, which makes it worth the ratings bump."}
{"text":"I ended up at Yueh Tung because it supposedly is one of the best Hakka restuarants within Chinatown but I would beg to disagree. Though - the shrimp and eggplant with pork was very tasty the chili chicken was disappointing. Sure, there was chicken and there was chili but there were no fireworks. And the space lacked ambience - there was no music and the lighting was way too bright."}
{"text":"ive been going to yueh tung for 10+ years it is in the top 5 hakka places in toronto in my opinion. everything there is solid, machurian chicken, fried rice, are the best there."}
{"text":"This was such a disappointment. I came over the lunch hour try the chilli chicken with friends. It came very quick, a huge portion on white rice, twice the amount of sauce needed, very bland. Not recommended.  I'm only leaving this review because I read a glowing CBC article about it. Seriously folks you can do better."}
{"text":"This place would be packed out the door on a typical lunch hour, mostly with business type people - with good reason, prices are lower than what you'd pay for at a fast food place and it's usually fresh. Chilli chicken, as you probably already read is the most popular, other dishes are pretty good as well, but I wish they had a few more options with less rice and thick sweet sauces and more naturally flavourful meats. But you can't go wrong if you are looking for a $7 lunch that will fill you up. Come in just before 12 if you are doing lunch."}
{"text":"Large sitting area and minimal wait even on busy days. I would recommend the chili chicken. Service is quick. Nothing fancy in terms of service but food is pretty decent and costs are reasonable. Bathrooms are not the cleanest."}
{"text":"I went here recently after having it bookmarked for months.  It's a middle of the pack: 2.5 stars here. I had been looking for a hakka cuisine downtown and this may be the place.  The chilli chicken was quite tasty and there were more good than bad.  Food: 3/5, the chilli chicken wasn't as spicy which was a bit weird but overall good.  The portions were somewhat small versus typical chinese food.  Service: 2/5, not as great as you have to ask a lot to get service here.  You can say this is typical of chinese restaurants in the area  Ambiance: 3/5, no complaints. Comfortable and spacious seating and clean place  Price: 2/5, it was $20+ per person for sharing four dishes.  It was a bit pricy for chinese food."}
{"text":"I came here for the hakka food. The waiter was funny, the food was not.  I miss scarboro and markham shops more now."}
{"text":"Let's start with the Chili Chicken. Might be my favorite Chinese restaurant dish ever. At least it's on a short list. The Black cod (fried) was outstanding as well. My morher-in-law had the eggplant, which I don't eat. She said it was just average.   A couple of issues. Our waiter was brusque and not so friendly. Also, the dishes don't come with rice. I have never been to a Chinese restaurant that didn't serve rice along with the dishes."}
{"text":"Being Hakka myself, I can proudly say that if you like Hakka food then Yueh Tung is the right place to be at. Not only is there the popular Indian Hakka food that most people associate Hakka food with, but Yueh Tung also offers traditional and Cantonese Hakka style food, which is refreshing to see.   Although I haven't tried these the traditional Hakka dishes, (let's say I eat them at home), the overall flavours and the textures of these dishes definitely hit home and does taste like homestyle Hakka cooking.  I was invited by my friends' family who really like this place and used to frequent this place often in the past as a result, I let them have the freedom of ordering what they like. I would have liked to try like keu nyuk (not sure if this is ham choy gon), bitter melon, and stuffed tofu. I have been here twice and have had pleasant experience both times.   This time we ordered the chili fish on a sizzling plate (their favourite), Manchurian chicken on fried chow mein, beef fried rice, curry chicken, and mixed vegetables.   Overall, the gist of these dishes can be rather heavy and on the dark side. This means high on salt, soy, and a bit of grease. It's not for everyone, and typically this is not indicative of traditional Hakka food but for the Indian styled dishes. I am used to eating quite low sodium foods at home so Yeuh Tung was on the salty side but there's many Hakka places that are much worse.  Chili fish was great but the one heaviest on the salt. There was a nice amount of spice (nothing here was too spicy by the way!) And the sweet onions balance it out with crunch and some sweetness. The Manchurian  sauce here was excellent and is different than many other Hakka places, this is one of the examples of a more traditional homestyle taste. The fried rice, and noodles were both standard. The curry was interesting,  and I'm not sure what to make of it, it was good but I wouldn't necessarily call it curry. It was not an oily curry and was cornstarch based.  All dishes arrived quickly and the service here was also quick and efficient. The waiters were often joking with us and it was rather interesting. I don't think it's for everyone but for the most part, I was okay with it."}
{"text":"So great. Our waiter was so nice and friendly. We had a good talk about the upcoming election. Lots of places are so cold or indifferent. Not here. The service was excellent. We had wonton soup with vegetables and shrimp in lobster sauce and both were great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Lunch today was surprisingly quick and delicious. Surprised only a small menu is available at lunch. Schlepping to the second floor can be treacherous with the badly designed stairs and the wonky handrails."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places for lunch on Friday if weather permits. Yueh Tung is probably the cheapest decent Chinese food you can find in downtown. They have a menu full of different white rice dishes and you can change the white rice to fried rice, rice noodle or yellow noodle for an additional charge.  My go to dish is this dish we call \"Every Men's Romance\" in Hong Kong, the legendary beef brisket/bbq pork and tofu stick on rice.  Great amount of beef and tofu sticks and great amount of sauce - the key to make this dish so delicious!  If you want to venture out from your regular menu items, I highly recommend the \"Every Men's Romance\" dish!  For less than $10, it is a pretty darn awesome deal!"}
{"text":"Disappointed to say the LEAST. I've been going to Yueh Tung for years but my visit yesterday was horribly disappointing. We ordered the chilli chicken, chicken pakoras, and chicken chowmein and nothing had taste; the Hakka flavour was no where to be found, it was like eating boiled, tasteless chicken. We barely ate any of the food, we won't be going back. It was a waste of time and money, as we didn't take any of the food with us.   When the waitress came to give us the bill and take out containers she insisted that next time we order less because we were wasting the food and made some other remarks comparing her son to us.   Paid, tipped 50 cents but our waitress still didn't get the point and continued to point and talk about us as we walked out.  HORRIBLE experience, wouldn't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"What can I say? I have never had a bad meal here.  The lunch specials are enough for two meals. The must try items are: Chicken Pakora, Manchurian Fish, Chilli Chicken,  Manchurian Soup, And Manchurian Beef with chow mein Noodles. Lunch specials can be had at any time of the day with an upsell of 1 dollar when not at lunch hours, still a great value in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great place. Quality quantity for good price. Chilli chicken/beef awesome."}
{"text":"This place has been around for decades and its easy to see why. These traditional hakka dishes are fantastic and are a must try if you come to Toronto.  The decor is a modern version of a chinese restaurant, very family friendly and extremely inviting. Though they do fill up rather quickly due to their small restaurant size, they are worth the wait.  We had the 4 dishes which were all equality fantastic:  Dry Chilli Chicken Full of flavor, you get a strong taste of garlic and a hint of spicy from the green chilli. Its not blow your head spicy so for all you chilli heads (myself included) you will likely want to add more spicy to the dish.  Chicken Pakoras Deep fried chicken thighs in an indian spice mix was fantastic. The subtle flavors of the tumeric is enough to keep you wanting more, make sure you add the lemon to cut though the grease.  Singapore Noodles This is the only place I know that actually adds curry powder to the noodles make these the best singapore noodles in town in my opinion! I recommend you definitely try this dish!  If you're in town and need your hakka fix, come to this place and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay I assume the reason why this place is popular is because it's fast and it's close to a lot of offices. Up a flight of a stairs and you've made it. Though busy during the lunch hours our group of 4 were able to find a seat in little time.   Upon hearing the positive feedback in the past we ordered their chili chicken (not hakka @ all) as this place is considered Cantonese style and NOT Hakka like Spadina Garden just down the road. Along with that we tried their snow peas with beef, Cantonese noodles and lastly the waiters recommended spicy shrimp.  Out of all 4 dishes I'd say the top dishes were their chili chicken and shrimps which scored a solid 3.5/5. However the remainder dishes were a solid 2.5, nothing fancy nor special. The portion were sufficient and their prices were somewhat fair, again, take into consideration with all the offices nearby people will pay what they have to.. Overall service was very personable, efficient and overall a gem.    Would I come back here,  sure, but I wouldn't go out of my way as there are other food options in the area worth trying."}
{"text":"Drink coming in different sizes but charge u the same price.. Serves is great but food is so so ..... Will think twice coming back !!!!' Grosssss!!!!!"}
{"text":"When you first walk in to the restaurant, it'll almost seem like it's closed down because it's an empty space with stairs leading up to the second floor. Once you reach the top, you realize you're at the right place - there's usually a good number of people dining here, and for good reason - decent food for a cheap price.  Their portions are massive. I ordered individual soup orders and really each bowl could've easily been enough for two people. Also got the chicken pakora (best chicken pakora I've had) and fried noodles, and it barely looked like it was touched after my friend and I were stuffed. The amount of food we ordered was enough for 4 people and yet we only paid $18 per person. Crazy.  They advertise that they have the best hot and sour soup and as a fan of hot and sour soup I actually agree. I've even come here to just have the soup. It's filled with lots of stuff like shrimp, BBQ pork, and bell peppers, so that you're bound to have chunks of stuff with each sip. I personally prefer chunky soup so this hot and sour soup definitely hits the spot.  But aside from their chicken pakora, fried rice, and hot and sour soup I usually order, everything else I've gotten from them were just average. The Hakka fried noodles I ordered today wasn't bad, but it was just bland. Their menu is fairly large though, so I'm not even close to exhausting through their entire menu - it's quite possible that I'll find another hit somewhere in there. Until then, I'm still sticking to the hot and sour soup and the chicken pakora."}
{"text":"After reading reviews, I decided to finally give this place a try. I went in on good friday around 2pm, and was surprised to find it relatively empty. not that it mattered, but when you read my review, I wonder if it contributed to the lackluster food I had.  Ordered the chili chicken naturally, since it was the dish that everyone recommended. my group also ordered the crispy beef on my recommendation, and the chili soft shell crab.  the chili chicken was sadly disappointing. it wasn't spicy at all, but then maybe that's just my taste. it was also lukewarm (some pieces felt warmer than others), and kinda soggy to be honest. All in all, I didn't feel like it was fresh. it had the taste, feel, and consistency of something you'd get at mandarin under heat lamps for a whole day. With pieces being at different temperatures, I wonder if they just mircowaved whatever was lying around. Maybe during a weekday when it's super busy, they're turning it over alot more, and serving fresh batches. but on this particular day, it was not up to snuff.  my friends crispy beef was actually alot better. it was hot, tasty, a little too sweet for my liking, but it was more appetizing to say the least. The soft shell crab wasn't too bad either. it had good flavour, but even that was a little too salty.  with everyone saying how good it is, I'm willing to give it one more try at lunchtime in hopes that my bad experience was a one-off. but a little more attention to consistency and balance in the food is needed in my opinion.  the one positive thing I can say, is that you do get a fairly large portion for the price. but then, it's not a huge positive if you get a largeer portion of mediocre food."}
{"text":"Got takeout from this place today. Chili chicken was pretty good, everything else was bland and lacking any sort of flavours. We ordered Chicken fried rice, Shanghai chow mein, BBQ pork chop suey, Sweet & sour chicken and egg rolls and were very disappointed. Won't order from there again."}
{"text":"Really disappointing!   Grabbed a couple dishes for lunch from here today and was pretty disappointed.  Food: I ordered the hot and sour soup as well as the calamari (fried squid).  The calamari was soggy and bland.  The hot and sour soup wasn't that flavourful either. Soup was also vegetarian - not what I ordered.   Restaraunt: Was busy but definitely not full. Looked like a good place to go with coworkers. Looked clean and nice.  Service: The service was okay. The lady was very nice when ordering and told me it would take about 15mins. When getting there at that time I had to wait another 15minutes. When asking her politely how long it would take she told me to order at least 25-30mins in advance. Which was fine, it was just that she said it would only take 15minutes when calling in. Anyways I'm not too fussed about the whole thing, more as a side note that you need to order 30minutes in advance of pickup.   Cost: $$"}
{"text":"I'm of Hakka origin and I've been trying to find a good Hakka restaurant but I know a lot of restaurants in Toronto served Indian fusion Hakka dishes which makes my search difficult but thanks to Yelp I found this gem. I later found out the owner of this restaurant is Hakka too!   But anyway, let's stick to reviewing this place. I ordered Keu Nyuk (braised pork belly with preserved vegetables), Ginger & Green Onion Chicken, and Ma Po Tofu.   I have to say, the dishes did wow me. The pork reminded me of home and the chicken dish was how my mom would make it. The tofu on the other hand, was not the same as where I'm from but it's delicious nevertheless. The only issue I have with this place was, everything was starchy. Minus the heavy starch it would have been a perfect 5 stars from me.   I would recommend this place to people who would wanna try Hakka dishes and to my Hakka brothers and sisters, search no more cause this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy their chilli chicken or Shanghai noodles, too saucy and a lack of texture. Chilli chicken wasn't spicy and was just bleh... wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Really traditional Chinese food there, reminds me of several years ago. Tastes here are not bad as a Chinese restaurant in trt. The prices are fair too"}
{"text":"Nice place a friend of mine told me to come here as he been here couple if time and be liked it. I ordered the lunch special of chili chicken. I really liked the place and the organization. It seems like a dance place with cheap food. They had Christmas decoration which is nice. The food came with to much rice I expected there will be more chicken with less rice but its only for the lunch special from my understanding so I will suggest not to get the lunch special. The food is good no complaints for the place and price u play I will it was tasty. I really liked the servers they are unique  every survey with special attitude I hated that they donot speak proper English and they cannot explain the dishes u order it is like u have to know what to order. Over all I like the place and I will come back to try different dishest."}
{"text":"I will most likely not come back.   Their lunch specials are cheap and the portions are huge but the food is not very good. Really bland especially for Hakka food.   If I was really craving some Hakka and was downtown I might go here but I would probably not be satisfied."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese food in the center of downtown Toronto. A great option if you're craving good (though not amazing) Chinese food, and don't want to schlep all the way to Chinatown. Some dishes can be a bit salty, but overall all the dishes were pretty solid."}
{"text":"I love this place been eating here since the early 90s used to be across the street some of the best chinese ive had in the city looks much nicer and cleaner since recent renovation love chilli chicken, curry chicken, chicken in a pot"}
{"text":"Chili chicken was amazing. Highly recommended. Hakka Chow Mein was nothing special  (although the waiter warned me that it was not a dish that blows your mind, haha), but it was cooked well.   Service was decent, a little bit slow.  I am definitely coming back for more. We will see how they perform :)  UPD: Other dishes I recommend: General Kwan chicken wings.  This place is a good lunch option."}
{"text":"Hakka food lovers, rejoice! Yueh Tang is my go to Hakka place downtown.  Delicious Hakka food and reasonable price! (Not to mention it's literally 2 minutes away from my office :D)  Their chilli chicken (without sauce) is uber delicious and addictive and almost dangerous to try (trust me, you won't be able to stop). Generous portion for $10, you can't go wrong with this one! Crispy beef is also a must-try. Beef fried in crispy batter, in sweet sauce is too good to stop munching on. Don't even get me started on the chicken Pakkora.  Perfect appetizer to prepare your stomach for all the delicious food that's coming!  In terms of the service,  they're generally okay in terms of friendliness, but certainly very quick. That works for me because delicious food when I'm hungry trumps everything else!   I'd definitely reco this restaurant if to ever crave for Hakka food - definitely one of the good ones downtown!"}
{"text":"Came here for a going away lunch at work with a few people. They were very accommodating at the size of the group. There were 20 of us and was willing to do separate bills. Decor is very typical Chinese restaurant. From what I can see that came out of the kitchen portions were big. We decided to do dinner style ordering. Had chili chicken, mixed vegetables, chili fish and ginger beef. The best dish imo was the chili fish. Nice crisp and  good season. The amount of salt they use however turned me off a little. All of the dishes served was too salty for my liking. Service was good though. They seem to pump out dishes fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Dunno why the ratings are so low. We've been here for dine-in and take-out combined about 10 times and it's always been good service and great food."}
{"text":"So far my fave restaurant in Toronto. The food is really authentic. I had the beef and pork dishes, they were perfectly cooked and tenderized, the chilli chicken is great too. I always order extra, so I have left overs to enjoy.. later."}
{"text":"Still the best chili chicken in toronto after over a decade and several changes in management!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem when i was in Toronto a few months ago. They specializes in Hakka cuisine, which I've never had before. I ordered the special Hakka noodle soup and the Hakka tofu. Both dishes were delicious and the portions were huge. I would definitely go back the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"What happens when you mix over simplified Hakka food with lack of seasoning? You get Yueh Tung. As a restuarant, Yueh Tung is surprisingly inviting, up to the stairs is a cozy restaurant with a huge sitting area and comfortable tables. Sit down, and you're presented with a huge list of Chinese dishes from the classic standby, as well as some Hakka specialities. But once you get the food, that's another story. After going to Yueh Tung time and time again to try out different parts of the menu, everything from poultry to fish, BBQ to noodles, it seems like Yueh Tung sticks to a formula, a formula that produces bland food, sauced to oblivion.   The menu is set up in a way such that you can pick and choose your protein, then your style (often sauced), and a flavour. With all these permutation, what you end up creating is a fried, bland dish that is passable for drunk food.   So if you're in the area, walk a bit further to Chinatown, you'll have a much better experience."}
{"text":"Having tried a number of Hakka restaurants throughout the years, this is hands-down the best the GTA.  My collegues and I used to go there for lunch at least once a week when I worked for the City.  This place is really popular and super busy and, honestly, aside from a couple of these reviews, I've never known anyone not to love it.  Dishes such as chili chicken, crispy beef, pork fried rice, etc are simply outstanding.  The lunch specials are the best deal ever (two people can share) but it can be a bit of a wait - I would suggest pre-ordering and picking up closer to 2pm.  I've only dined about a handful of times and I didn't have an issue at all with the service or the food arriving hot and on a timely manner.  All in all, you get delicous food and large quanties at a great price!"}
{"text":"A decent Hakka fix if you can't make it out east.   The chilli chicken and manchurian chow mien were amazing. The hot and sour soup was spiked with curry and honestly the best I've ever had. The shrimp pakoras were also quite tasty.   Service was pretty terrible, even for Chinatown. Long wait times, staggered food delivery (our last dish had to be packed to go because it wasn't done until we had finished the entire meal), and being outright ignored most of the time. I would go back for takeout but don't think I would go through sitting down there again."}
{"text":"I fell in love with YT many moons ago when I first tried their chili chicken on rice and shrimp with lobster sauce on rice.  I still fondly recall all the lovely meals I've had here and when I happened to be in the area, I thought I'd pick up dinner to share their lovely food with the family.    Had I written this review some 20 years ago, it would have been a solid 5 stars for sure but the take out experience wan't exactly as great as I remembered my old favorites.    We had hot and sour soup (still yum), chili chicken (was too greasy and not as good as I remembered), niu rouk (ok), ...etc that I can't exactly recall because they were so underwhelming.  Perhaps it was the take out factor or I'm just getting older with fading memories.    I wouldn't mind going back to try my old favorites in the restaurant but I just don't know when that'll be."}
{"text":"This restaurant is buzzing during the day filled with City workers because it is located just behind City Hall. Anyways, I go to this place because of the Manchurian Chicken on rice. IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!! Again, I travel the long distance just to satisfy my craving for this dish. I've had other versions of this spicy dish in other restuarants but at Yueh Tung it is the best in the city, if you like spicy food try this dish."}
{"text":"Hmm, I noticed a few of the other reviews of this place mentioned they thought the service could have  been better. I'd have to say that service has never been a problem for me here. The place is nice and clean after they got renovated a few years ago. And I think the food here is pretty good. The portions are pretty large too. One thing I wish that was different about their food is that their spicy dishes aren't spicy at all (though that might just be me). I don't really know what authentic Hakka should taste like, and maybe for Hakka style that's as spicy as it gets (?). But my friend that I come here with say that it is authentic though. I got their spicy fish chow mein last time I was there. I don't think I've ever seen that on a menu anywhere else before, so I got that. I like it! It's different and it's good! I also like their veggie dishes here! This is one of these places in the area that I would definitely go to when I want a low-key, quick, but good meal."}
{"text":"Found this place on a whim. As soon as I walked in, I knew I'd enjoy. The place was packed and every dish that came by looked delicious. The restaurant serves Hakka cuisine which is an Indian-Chinese fusion. This was my first time trying this approach in food. I was very pleased.  Calamari Fitters (aka Fried Calamari) was crunchy without being oily not heavy. Very savory and just needed a squeeze of lemon juice.   Sweet Soy Hakka Cow Mein has barbeque pork mixed with bean sprouts and green onions covered in a sweet soy sauce. My favorite out of the items ordered.   Chili Chicken Chow Mein was thin noodles covered in a brown sauce that was slightly spicy. Not overpowering at all.   Entrées are large and prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend eating family style so you can enjoy a bit of everything.   Note - this is only a few blocks from the Eaton Center, Sheridan and Marriott hotels. An easy on-foot venture."}
{"text":"Delicious Hakka Chinese! Visited the restaurant in a large group and was happy with the bright comfortable ambience. Crispy Beef, Prawn fried rice, Chicken Manchurian (no gravy but delicious), calamari (appetizer) and Chicken chowmein!!! What's not to like!!!  It's a great spot if you are seriously craving Hakka! Will definitely visit again :)"}
{"text":"Chilli chicken was good, could have had a little more sauce. Service was friendly and attentive, seemed like a family business, good experience for first Hakka restaurant"}
{"text":"Cheap hakka Chinese food here. Not healthy but just lots of carbs and sauce type of quick cheap food.  Pro: portion size and price Cons: taste is average"}
{"text":"I don't get it.   So, I had the chili chicken since it's their signature dish, apparently.  Someone else on yelp called it a bowl of steamed rice with chicken-in-sauce glop.  Totally agree.  It didn't taste like anyrthing other than garlic, water and cornstarch.  Notice how I didn't mention spicy?  A big ole' Meh, as the 2 star rating implies. (more than a 1 because it was fast and cheap)  The service deserves a mention because it is horrible to the point of endearing.  Let me explain. The food came quickly after we ordered.  In fact, it came not just once but several times.  Each time the reaction from the server was a combination of confusion and annoyance.  As I was told, it is common for servers to show up to your table with random plates of food several times a meal.  If our food didn't show up so quickly, it would have been annoying to say the least. Instead, the comedy of errors that was the service gave the place a certain \"charm\"  as my frustration turned to pity.  Any way,  I am missing whatever it is about the food that gets people so excited. And really, food is the reason why I go (and go back) to a restaurant. Flavorless glop, however, is, even for $6, not enough incentive to get me to return."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a little kid starting with the chicken hot pot which is absolutely delicious it is sweet and sour taste and their legendary chilli fish just eat with a bowl of white rice absolutely delicious. The service is amazing. I can come here everyday but it is kind afar from my place. Everytume I come.ehre I always order hot and sour soup chilli fish and chicken bot pot and their fried rice is to die for. I like how afyer you finish the meal they always give you complimentary fortune cookies and oranges one time I went here I be ove the manager gave us a calender with he Chinese horoscopes which was really nice of them. Everyone we go to downtown we always seem to go to yueh tung. I will definetly come here for many years to come."}
{"text":"I personally am not a big fan of Hakka but a ton of people love this place. It's good if you like that sort of food. I do order it from time to time, the chilli chicken on rice, and it's always consistent. Recommend you try it for sure just to see if you like it.   It's a family owned and operated and the daughters are very pretty."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Hakka food and it was delicious! We ordered the Manchurian chicken and beef with broccoli. The manchurian sauce is so delicious and I'll be coming back to try some other dishes. The service was great, there were two friendly servers tending to us."}
{"text":"One of the better places for lunch downtown  Pros: Large amount of lunch specials Good value  Cons: Dishes are on the salty side  Chili chicken is definitely one of my top 5 fav dishes so it's only natural I would make my here eventually.  I had a day off and met up with my GF for lunch here.  Yueh Tung is well known by the locals living and working in the area.  It's a pretty large place with plenty of seats on top of a sushi restaurant.  One look at their lunch menu and you can see they offer a ton of options.  Every dish is $8 save for some seafood ones.  I have never seen a place with this many lunch specials.  They have chicken, pork, seafood, beef, veggie and Chinese BBQ dishes.  There are little add ons like veggies for about a dollar each.  You could come here everyday for lunch and almost not get bored!  We of course ordered the chili chicken.  The chili chicken here is very good.  I would say top 10 in the city for sure.  Frederick's will always be my favourite but I like the one here too.  I prefer the dry version rather than the gravy version.  The gravy version is a little salty and they give you a tone of sauce so it salty is not your thing, it could be a little overwhelming.  Noentheless, you get good value and a great lunch here.  I'm not downtown often for lunch, but Yueh Tung is a solid entry for lunch time that I recommed to anyone who likes Chinese and Hakka food."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  We always come back for their tasty Manchurian Chicken (dry), i preder dry as its crispier than the saucy one.  Crispy beef and snowpea leaves were also great.  Food always comes hot and fast. Servers are quick to respond to any of our request. One time i had to heat up baby bottle and asked for a glass of hot water, he gave us a whole pot cuz he said it would better and easier to heat up the bottle. Very nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Hakka fix in Toronto - this is the spot.   Quality and service? You know what to expect."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto when I stumbled upon Yueh Tung...famous for its spicy Hakka cuisine..boy, was I in for a treat! the Chili chicken and the Manchurian chicken took me back to my days in Delhi...perfect spiciness and flavor...best Indian Chinese I have eaten in this part of the world. I was so excited to see the menu and knowing I would  miss this food back in LA, I ordered way too much...:)  We did take out so the review is only for the food and yes, it was that good! we ordered the steamed live oysters in black bean sauce...they are jumbo sized oysters and totally worth ordering, loved them! The Manchurian chicken was yummy as was the chili chicken. We also ordered the chow mien and one of the rice dishes and they were ok. I would come back here just to have the chili chicken and the Manchurian chicken....If you have never eaten Indian Chinese, then be aware that these dishes are very different from the regular Cantonese menu items and are spicy and pretty  flavorful. I can't wait to go back to Toronto and try them again."}
{"text":"Okay. I don't really have to comment on how ridiculously good the chilli chicken is here. But ever since I moved to Toronto from India, I've yet to come across a restaurant that serves quality hakka food in the city that reminds me home. But this place does!! Highly recommend if you're looking for good hakka food."}
{"text":"This place was rated well for its hakka so we decided to give it a go. Decent looking place and one of the better looking places in Chinatown. A pretty big space so it would be good for large groups that can go up the stairs. We ordered two dishes and hot and sour soup. Goods score on the soup and the eggplant which spicy. The other item was bland. Service was decent. For the number of staff in hand, they should have been more available and attentive. This is now our new hot and sour soup place and we would go back, just be selective in your order."}
{"text":"Woot! Woot! Yeuh Tung is back to making awesome Chili Chicken.    experiences after the renovation made us sad... But we gave it another chance and it tastes like it has for all the years we have loved it which is more than 20 years!  (Yes, I'm old!)  Sweet and sour pork was really outstanding and tender as were the Singapore noodles - great curry flavour and heat.  Welcome back to the rotation Yeuh Tung!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was selected for out family get together this summer. We had 25 people so we need a lot or space and it has the capacity to handle us. The food came out very fast and tasty. The service is fair and the bill came to about 25$ per person which is very good. We would come back again."}
{"text":"3.5* is about right... having worked in the hospital district I have met more than my share of people who rave about Yueh Tung and look at me with disbelief when I tell them I find the food to be just aight!  The restaurant has become somewhat of a Toronto institution, and I guess for good reason; Yueh Tung has a certain consistency that most cheaper Chinese restaurants can not maintain! That being said, I have found the food to be consistently at standard level! The famous chilli chicken has ceased to really impress me and the Manchurian candidate, I mean beef is not something I have crave when I think of Hakka!  In brief, the portions are huge, the famous dishes are tasty albeit a bit too salty, and the value is just right!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap and cheerful, this is the way to go.  Good hakka chinese. Especially loved their chilli chicken with extra sauce - a recommendation from fellow yelpers. Portions are giant, food is tasty and prices are fantastic. A \"Small\" bowl of soup was more than enough for three people. One chicken dish with some portions of rice was good for four!  This is my go-to place for non-fancy non-gourmet Chinese - especially Hakka.  Our waiter was a funny fellow - kept cracking strange jokes and had us cracking up. Don't take a client - but go for a casual tasty meal with family and friends."}
{"text":"Before you read this review. Look at my pictures! The ones posted for Yueh Tung somehow don't capture the food very well because they look less appetizing than they really are.  If I had to describe Yueh Tung in 3 words, they'd be: 1. Cheap 2. Tasty 3. Fun  The venue of Yueh Tung looks much better than it did years ago. They renovated and have tons of large circular tables for big groups and booth seating for more privacy and comfort. Lighting in the restaurant is good as well as the large windows for natural lighting.  Like many reviewers have mentioned, their food is cheap. It's Chinese (Hakka) food so you can expect it to be fairly priced. We ordered the chicken wing stew (which has potatoes, tomatoes, and cilantro as well) and chili chicken. They were both delicious. Each dish is around $10 and bowls of rice generally cost $2. You'll get a good portion and have some to take home, no doubt.  The food tastes good. Do not let the price fool you. Just make sure to drink plenty of tea because you will get thirsty from the spices and salt. Great Hakka food.  Lastly, I want to say that the spot is fun. The people working at Yueh Tung are happy and fun people. Although their demeanor doesn't always show it, I get fun quirky dialogue whenever I'm talking to them.   Come here and give it a try. Then come back when you realize how cheap, tasty and fun the place is. Great background noise, plenty of space (especially for downtown Toronto), and fun staff make it a 5 star venue for me."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since university and their lunch special still makes me happy!  Nothing can go wrong with $7.99 manchurian chicken (extra hot)--a plate of deep friend chicken with spicy gravy on a bed of rice!  Most people go for the Chili Chicken but I'm not a fan of onions...  This place renovated almost 2 years now and swatting is much more comfortable and cleaner.  For those of you who have not tried Hakka food but love Chinese food and Indian food should give give this place a go--makes me so happy!"}
{"text":"The food is ok and price is actually very good given the portion and taste. But the service we get is shocking. We ordered a tofu dish that doesn't come with rice. We were a bit confused so asked the lady who served the dish why there is no rice. The restaurant was a bit loud so one of my friends voice was a little high. The waitress stormed to the table and screamed at us:\" why are you so angry?\" I tried to explain and told her we are not angry just it's too loud thats why my friend was trying to speak louder. She pointed at the customer and said:\" your face, why you face looks so angry! Why are you yelling at me!!!!\" We were honestly left in shock. I have never had this type of experience before. Very confused and a lunch totally ruined for unnecessary reasons. I hate to write bad reviews but this incidence really leave me no choice."}
{"text":"So we went here just before we caught a show. We were a group of four and decided to order four different dishes and share...  We ordered, the chili chicken with sauce (b/c other yelpers recommended it) the spicy eggplant and ground pork, and BBQ pork with rice X2 because our guests liked it. In addition to this we ordered the Bak Choy.                                                                             We all LOVED the chili chicken and actually ended up ordering another plate of it(snort snort) The spicy eggplant with ground pork was tasty but similar to many other places I have eaten at in Chinatown. BBQ pork was standard. The Bak choy was the usual.  The service was efficient. Decor, standard decor for Chinatown.. red carpet, some pics on the walls etc... I was also told that this place can be chilly in the winter months.. Hmmm....  I would suggest if you are going to go to this little hot spot for lunch and are on a tight schedule for lunch you should order ahead. They do offer take out. Service is quick food arrives on the table within 10 to 15 mins and it is a great spot to go if you are in a bit of a rush.   Prices were very cheap.   I would go back here if I was ever in the area."}
{"text":"The best Manchurian Chicken in town... Great place, Great food, Great service. the place is packed during lunch time, if you want to grab a table  better be there around 11:45 or else you will have to wait 30 mins or more..."}
{"text":"There's A lot that you could say about this restaurant!   It used to be kind of a dive but always had great food now that the decor is amazing and the food is better than never. A lot of variety of dishes  and the chili chicken I'd staple.   The only reason it doesn't get five starts is because it can sometimes be greasy."}
{"text":"My husband is addicted to this place. It is good value for the money, the food is pretty tasty. Finding parking in the area is a bit of a pain. The decor is acceptable and the lighting is decent. I would recommend the Manchurian chicken."}
{"text":"Snow pea shoots w/ garlic was okay.Chili chicken is awesome. At first, it tastes merely decent but as you eat more and more of it, it tastes better and better. I don't know why it does, but it just does."}
{"text":"Yueh Tung (pronounced \"yueh tung\") is a Hakka Chinese restaurant at the corner of Dundas and Elizabeth, right above Pho Orchid. The entrance is on Elizabeth St, so you'll have to head a bit south of Dundas to find it. Once you've ascended the opulent carpeted stairs, you'll find the glory of Yueh Tung. I was worried at first by the row of seated patrons at the entrance, but it turns out they were waiting for takeout (a good sign). We headed for the maitre d' and Even though the restaurant was packed on a Friday night, we snagged a table pretty quickly.  Three of us ordered the Hakka chow mein, BBQ pork fried rice, chili chicken and hot and sour soup. It's a good thing we ordered the \"small\" soup portion because it was enough to feed eight people. I can't imagine why our waiter even gave us the option. Would he have brought us the large if we asked for that? I could imagine him clunking it down with both arms. \"Here's your punch bowl of soup. Idiots.\"  Let it be known: the portion sizes at YT are enormous. Minutes after ordering we were buried. The chow mein was cooked in a sweet soya sauce and was really nice. I've been spoiled by other hot and sour soups in the city, so I can only give theirs a 'meh.' The chili chicken was OK, but a bit overcooked and saddest of all: not spicy. The BBQ pork fried rice was BBQ pork fried rice, so I liked it.  So, while I was underwhelmed by the food, I'd have to say this place gets major points for value and service. Dinner for three clocked in around $30 including tip AND we had tonnes of leftovers. We also espied more than a few sizzling dishes pass our table, and wished we had gotten us some of that. I'll give them another try.  Obligatory Title Pun: Get this TUNG in your cheeks.  Menu Readability: It's pretty long, but all your options are well-laid out.  Need to mention: They accept debit and credit.  What this place teaches me about myself: I can't pronounce Yueh Tung."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favourite places to eat after going to school at Ryerson university. It is very affordable for a student income, the portions are large and the staff are very friendly. As well as they serve very interesting kinds of alcohol!   This amazing experience is tucked away at a side street intersecting Dundas. In fact, when looking for a place to eat, I have missed this place many times.   My favourite dishes to order are the ginger chicken, salt and pepper pork chops, black beans fried cod and the salty fish fried rice! Everything comes out hot and fresh. I do recommend getting vegetables with all the meat focused dishes here. It can get a bit spicy but everything can be called with tea.   They have plenty of seating and usually is packed. However the complimentary tea and servers will always bring you back!"}
{"text":"One place in Toronto that has not been hit my inflation. Come for lunch. Yummy chinese food for the price.  Below are my top picks: chilli chicken on crispy noodle eggplant and shrimp with minced pork on rice curry fish on rice some kind of bean curd on rice (I will come back to fill in the name once I remember) two kinds of bbq on rice (roasted pork i think + bbq duck)"}
{"text":"NOTE: I'm giving 2-stars for the dish, not the resto.  I've heard the hype about their chili chicken so when I passed by the resto on my walk home last night, I decided to order it for dinner. The restaurant was empty except for one couple. The take-out guys were  friendly and efficient. Didn't wait long for my food. On my walk home, I kept smelling the food and was salivating with every step. Finally get home and give it a try and...........lackluster. I honestly did not find anything special about this dish that gives it all the hype. Quite disappointed with it actually, especially since I gave up my healthy dinner of fish & veggies for it.   I will go back and try their other foods though. I haven't had good hakka since I moved from Scarberia years ago."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from this place and got the following:  - seafood chow mein - crispy beef - deep fried cod fish with soy sauce  all flavourless, all bad. the chow mein wasn't even crispy, it was like they missed frying up a piece of it. service as discussed below was HORRIBLE. There are better places around this area, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've been going to this place over 16 years.  SIXTEEN FRIGGIN YEARS!  My record is 12 times in 3 weeks, and I admit that was a bit much but Carpe Diem!  (or YOLO if you don't know what that was #readabook)  Time for a review of one of my favorite dives in the world.    Lets get something straight: you don't Chili Chicken (yeah thats what we call this place, \"Yueh Tung?  Oh you mean Chili Chicken\") for the service, the decor, the bathrooms, whatever else you would reasonably rate a restaurant on.    You go for the Chili Chicken.  Thats it.  Well ok, there are a few other items on the short list but I'll get to that later.  If this is your first time, get the Chili Chicken.  Eat it.  Have the epiphany that your taste buds have been missing whole new chunk of vocabulary to describe taste.  Cheap nasty Hakka goodness.  That gnawing sensation in the back of your brain?  Thats addiction brewing my friend.   Trip 2- Oh don't kid yourself, you'll be back.  Sure, act all cool about it but I know your jonsing for more CC.  Next time get it again, but extra spicy and with Chinese Broccoli for a dollar extra.  Trip 3- Same as above if you liked it, but get the Hot and Sour soup.  Best in the city.  Best in THE WORLD.  Trip 4 -Mix it up a bit, try the Curry Chicken on rice.  Extra spicy and with Chinese Broccoli again cause mom said veggies blah blah  Trips 5-1,248 - You are now able to spread your wings and try other things on the menu.  Then of course come back to CC, but hey you might like other stuff!    Please learn from my mistakes: Don't ever try the following items:  Special Hakka Soup- it's not good.  I call it \"Weird Soup\" Bitter Melon- they are not kidding, the melon is bitter, and while I get that it may be an acquired taste, it was too.. odd.  See \"Weird Soup\" above  Also NEVER complain!  The staff are wily and have long memories.  Also they haven't really rotated the staff in 16 years so you know they can't be fired.  Just roll with it.  See you there.  No, really.  D"}
{"text":"Just had the lunch special, nothing short of amazing, both me and my daughter enjoyed. They made her chilli chicken dish with no spice, still great."}
