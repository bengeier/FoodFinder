{"text":"pros:  -large outside covered patio -fast service -large portions -clean bathrooms  cons:  - too salty, greasy, somewhat flavorless food - expensive (especially for lunch) - poorly set-up (confusing- do i get the take-out containers and the fortune cookies or am i supposed to ask the server?)"}
{"text":"Chinese fast food?  It's actually not bad.  Menu selection is limited, in my opinion.  Very passable fried rice, and they've got a decent spicy chicken dish.  Frankly, I don't bother eating here when there are better Chinese restaurants (Shun Li, P.F. Chang's (stop laughing))."}
{"text":"I will try almost any restaurant once, especially one that serves Asian food. I stopped in to try out this new restaurant and it was dead inside. You order your food at the counter and they give you a number and bring your food to your table. It looks fancier than your typical \"counter menu\" restaurant but whatever.   I ordered rice paper rolls and won ton soup. Easy enough, right? The noodles in one of the rolls are undercooked or refrigerated and really chewy, I know this because the noodles in the other roll were really soft. The hoisin sauce dip is so thick that the rice paper roll just kind of breaks apart. Ok, now onto the soup. Please don't order the soup. It's salted chicken broth with gummy won ton skins, filled with ground chicken (what??) that falls apart when you chew it.   I ate a third of my food. I could have complained but no one came to check on me or to ask how the food was. So I will complain with my wallet. There's no way in hell I'm ever going back there.  I get that it's a counter service restaurant, but if you're a new place, you should have servers or managers asking people how their food is."}
{"text":"So bad. Don't waste your money.  The takeout was literally so bad that I went back out and got takeout from Thai Thai on East Blvd.  Tofu was gross.  Not spiced well. And very over priced."}
{"text":"I went there and ordered a chicken orange peel  was really good the orange flavor was a happy medium. The server and hostess were extremely nice. I also enjoyed their crab ragoons it wasn't just full of cream cheese like other places. My girlfriend order the lo mein which was delicious and she also ordered a mama dessert roll which was like cheese cake in a egg roll form cover in cinnamon and sugar, served I with a plate drizzled with strawberry syrup and whip cream. I been back a few times it was a really great place. I consider it my diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Worst asian food.  We went the first week it opened and the food was disgusting.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Had a great family dinner here recently! Candice is a wonderful server and even with a large group, she and her fellow server kept up with us! Food was very good and decently priced. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Mam Fu's Sucks.  Don't eat  here.  There are so many other faster ,cheaper, better Chinese places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It was a good experience overall. We went on a Friday evening.....and were very surprised to learn that we were the only guests there.  Beautiful Friday evening, attached to a mall and movie theater..... I was expecting some waiting.  Oh well. Eventually one more group came in. Needless to say that service was quick and friendly. Server was good, and honest (not the salesman type who would push specials or say everything is good). They have lots of vegetarian options- and almost everything can be made veg. They also have a vegan and gluten free menu for those who want it. We ordered one app and one entree to split. The veg spring rolls were yummy. Presentation was inviting as well. The size was quite larger than the typical spring rolls. The entree was also delicious. We had the Seoul style curry with fried rice. It was well seasoned and plentiful.  Only complaint about that is that they added kimchi to our dish even though we specifically asked not to.  But I was able to take it off without effecting my dish. Prices are reasonable as well. I will go again."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst food I've ever had delivered in my life... The chicken was more like chicken jerky... And cold!!!  The only good thin was the attractive guy that delivered it."}
{"text":"I ordered from here for delivery. Ordering online was easy and the food arrived promptly and around time stated. While the food itself was decent, the portions for the money are laughable. I ordered the Mongolian Beef and it was about  less than half of what you'd get from a typical delivery joint, and cost a few dollars more to boot. My lettuce wraps came without the lettuce or sauce, just the filling. Dinner for two with appetizers and tip was over $50. Will probably skip them in the future. Too bad,had hoped the area would get a quality delivery place."}
{"text":"Super yummy!  Great waiter service. I was here for dinner and yes, it was dead but I don't know what all this \"Order at the counter\" commotion is all about. We were waited on by a lovely woman who was incredibly helpful! I ordered the Lo Mein with tofu and it was beyond expectations. Tofu is usually bland however, it was made perfectly. Amazing meal and very easy to make your meal vegan! I am super picky with Asian food because I lived in Asia so long however, this hit the spot! Also, the salad was yummy though not authentic. I definitely recommend the dynamite ranch dressing. Great dining experience. I would give it five stars if they had vegetarian soups and few authentic drinks (like Thai tea)   Great meal, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I thought the food was exceptional! The Korean Street Tacos and General Fu were excellent, only to be outdone by Mama's Dessert Roll. The restaurant was clean and fragrant when we entered. Our drinks were refilled promptly. Our food arrived at the table without taking too long. The waitress left a lot to be desired. Took way to long to get the check to the table then cash out. Other than that, we will absolutely go back!!"}
{"text":"Find me here cramming lettuce wraps into my face and wishing they were free of calories. Though a chain, this is our sole Mama Fu's entity here in Crown Town. There used to whispers of another location, but this one is sailing solo with Asian fare to keep your lunch or dinner needs satiated. Doesn't really keep the feel of a chain, if you ask me.   My favorites --  Obviously the lettuce wraps. Simple flavors, finely chopped chicken, generous portions of iceberg lettuce, and a fantastic hoisin/ponzu/soy sauce. Great for dipping....or dousing.   Spicy General Fu. Just what you need or want in the spicy department. Goodness gracious, look out though. It'll light you up if you're not careful.   Veggie Lo Mein. Simple. Easy. Yum. Can I have some more. Yes. Please. Thank you.   Rare Tuna appetizer. Don't recall the proper name, but I'd eat this any day. It's always fresh and works great as an app or a smaller entree for one person.   Been coming here for quite some time and Bridgett, manager, is one of the nicest souls you'll ever come to meet. She's cordial, bright, and simply a joy to be around.   Also, in warmer climes, the patio is great for a sunny lunch.   If you're in Cotswold and need a quick lunch with plenty of Asian flare, Mama Fu's is a solid choice. More lettuce wraps, please!"}
{"text":"On nights when all the Thai restaurants are closed, I can get my fix for curry at mama fu's.  certainly not the best Thai in town but if you are rushed for time it's an easy pick-up after work. The spring roll app is good, the green bean side is delish!  My husband likes the pineapple fried rice when it's on the menu."}
{"text":"The apps were great, but the entrees disappointed.  Service on par with expectations."}
{"text":"well not good for us as the server didn't inform my guest that the ranch dressing was too spicy that it burned her lips and almost choke  she had initially wanted regular french dressing  but they didnt offer her that  so they lacked overing customer regular vareity of salad dressing like regular ranch,french...etc  when she did ask the server french  dressing and the server made the mistake of nodding yes when she doesnt know what a french dressing is  ? we are not coming back"}
{"text":"Ahi tuna was frozen and stringy..My boyfriend had General Yu shrimp . The shrimps was tasty the rice clumpy and very starchy.. Not worth the price"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and both times it was horrible.  I tried to like it; I really did.  Both times the service was painfully slow, even though there was only one other table in the entire restaurant!  Both times the wait staff was incompetent and unprofessional.  The food the first time was decent enough for me to give them another try.  The second time the food was mediocre at best.  Our dishes were very dry, so we asked for 2 sides of extra sauce.  About 10 minutes later it still had not come, so I walked around to find someone.  When I found our waitress, she made excuses about how it took so long because the kitchen had to make the sauce.  But the little cups were sitting there waiting for her to take them, so it was HER fault it had taken so long, not the kitchen crew.  I found that unprofessional.  Also, later I got up to use the restroom and my waitress stopped me on my way and asked how my food was.  It was so awkward!  You don't do that!  Speaking of the restroom:  It is nice and clean.  I give them props for that.  But the door to the bathroom has two large panes of frosted glass.  Because it's frosted, you can't really see anything more than colors and mild shapes through it, but seriously?? It makes me uncomfortable to use the restroom knowing someone outside can see my mildly exposed body!    Anyways, I'm never going back here.  I'm sorely disappointed in this restaurant.  I hope something better opens in this location when Mama Fu's inevitably goes out of business."}
{"text":"I went to a movie and afterwards ate at Mama Fu's.  I had a Steam bowl that had cooked vegtables that were not crunchy or under cooked.  Very tasty sauce came with it.  I'm going back to try Cashew Chicken."}
{"text":"I cannot begin to imagine how this dump stays open. The food is as poorly done as any nameless food joint in a mall, prices are high, and the service is mediocre. The fact they are close to my home means we've been 3-4 times, and every time we regret it (and, evidently, never learn). I've tried to do a phone-in take out twice: both times they quoted 15 minutes, took closer to 45 minutes, and then screwed up my order which cost another 20. I suspect tonight's fiasco (ordered at 5:45, was told 15 minutes, picked up my order at 6:30, then had to go back because they screwed it up again) will be the last."}
{"text":"Mama Fu's...it's like eating Chinese food from a mall's food court, but pricey. One of my colleagues brought Mama Fu's to work and it looked good. I was on my way back home and passed it and thought I'd give it a try.  It comes prepared very hot and fresh; however, the quality is lacking.  It's a good portion for sharing. The redeeming aspect of this establishment was the service. The individual that delivered my food was very friendly. Also, they offer free wi-fi.  I spent almost $10 and left unsatisfied. I regretted going there and spending that much when I could have spent the same at a higher quality place. They do offer a satisfaction guarantee on trying different entrees (if you branch out and get something different, but you don't like it, they'll make you something you do).  It was busy, so people do like it. Just know that if you go it is definitely fast food quality."}
{"text":"I love this place for so many reasons ....  1. They have a HUGE gluten-free menu. Not only does this make my life easier, but for those that are gluten sensitive or gluten intolerant, having so many choices was truly a wonder. Moreover ... Celiacs rejoice! Finally - an Asian place that has gluten-free soy sauce!!!  2. The service was phenomenal. The kind folks working at Mama Fu's were very welcoming and helpful, knowledgeable about the menu and the concept of cross contamination, and noticeably patient when one member of my group asked a zillion questions about the menu.  3. The business concept is much like that of Chipotle. It's not fast food, but it's not your typical restaurant either. Moreso, all of the food we were served was incredibly fresh and very delicious.  I love options like this one for times when I don't want to eat junk but I also don't want to spend 1.5 hours in a restaurant or $25 on a single meal.  4. Mama Fu's has a great location near the North Olmsted mall and next to the renovated movie theatre, making it a great spot for a post-shopping or -movie outing.  Long story short, had a tasty (and safe) meal here at a great price. The decor and service made my visit particularly pleasant, and the staff's knowledge of how to do gluten-free well will certainly make me a return customer!"}
{"text":"I really love Mama Fu's. Their variety is fantastic and not every Asian fusion restaurant does it right, but Mama Fu's gets it just right. Their chicken curry rolls and pad thai are two of my go-to lunches but you can't really go wrong with anything. Many times I've just asked their terrific manager, Bridgett, to recommend me something and somehow she knows what I want more than I do.  If you're craving something spicy give the Kraw Pow chicken a try, it's one of the best Asian dishes I've had at any restaurant. Their ample portions are enough for two meals, and their variety of brewed teas is pretty sweet too.  There's a great selection of restaurants to try in the Cotswold area, but Mama Fu's is nearly always at the top of my list because of their awesome food and staff."}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite of mine for a couple of years now.  It's always a special little treat on a nice spring day. The only downside of my experience is the price. The bill adds up quickly with only a small meal for two. Other than the price, the food is wonderful and there are plenty of options for all types of lifestyles. I enjoy the noodle bowls and the fried dumplings are to die for!! Cute little corner lot in Cotswold with a modern Asian atmosphere. The air conditioning could be turned up a notch. It is pretty chilly in there."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy my experience here. My rice was hard, I was missing elements, and my pork was dry and over cooked. I sent it back, as they were willing to remake it, and it came back just as unappetizing. The restaurant wasn't busy, but we were hard-pressed to receive refills at all. All of the appetizers were overpriced (4 quarter cuts of an eggroll for $5!) and all came with an inedible garnish of old salad and soggy chives. I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered a simple entree of chicken fried rice and a side of pot stickers for delivery. What I received was burned, dried up rice and very uncooked pot stickers! Worse experience ever! Stay away!"}
{"text":"This isn't real chinese food at all. Not even good Fast Chinese Food. Most take out places will have your food ready in 5-10 minutes. This place is no difference in speed.  They do like to toss some sugar water onto your meal though.  Food wasnt more than a normal Chinese lunch menu as well."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place in route to a meeting and short on time.  I was pleasantly surprised they were fast and the service was great.  I ordered the chicken wraps and the green beans with veggies and both was absolutely delicious. The only thing I'm going to add the next time I order is some mushrooms. :-)  I will return and bring my friends!"}
{"text":"I was afraid that this was just going to be an Asian Chipotle knock off. It isn't.  The menu has normal entrees and then you add whatever meat you would like. There are also lunch options and several really cool sides. Once you place the order, you sit down like a normal restaurant. Not a Chipotle.   The food is great. It is brought out by course, but still has the self serve pop though. A strange mix of formal and informal. For my side I ordered the pot stickers, they were great! For the entree, I had the Spicy Thai Basil. It was pretty good, great flavor and a medium amount of spice. I would get it again for sure.   Overall a pretty cool place. Decent food, cool interior, and a decent bar. Ya a bar. It has a full wet bar in the back. Not sure what and when they do there but I am pretty sure it wouldnt be too bad. Give these guys a try!"}
{"text":"....maybe 2 1/2 stars ?  No, it's not A-OK! It's not all bad either.  Seeing the confusing  American Chinese / pseudo Japanese/ Thai lite menu I didn't want to commit and instead chose two appetizers : \"Crispy golden calamari served with our own spicy dynamite dipping sauce\" and I think Thai shrimp in sweet chili sauce - extra hot for me please.   The weather at sunset was just perfect, I sat outside and chilled with a generous cup off Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio ($5) . If it wasn't for that I probably would have been pissed off with the food.   The calamare itself wasn't bad. It wasn't crispy but it wasn't tough either and mercifully it wasn't buried deep in fried breading like so many places. Plus it came with a bit of marinated ginger, nothing Korean mind you, but still, nice. BAD, the so called \"spicy dynamite dipping sauce\" was a joke, a bad joke! Absolutely bland and tasteless (what was it mayo and paprika?) so mild you could feed it to a baby.   I mentioned this to two of the kids working there but they looked lost, one even said that people don't order their Calamare spicy , I had to tell him spicy what the menu claims. Screw it! I ate the calamare without any sauce,picked on the ginger and washed it down with the wine.   The proper description for the shrimp sauce should have been \"really, really sweet chili sauce\"  My tastebuds were drowning in High Fructose sweetener,  good thing I had ordered extra hot it compensated, a little. The shrimp itself was passable and there were some bits of fresh veggies under all that so it didn't feel totally like junk food. No totally anyway.  So there you have it, passable shopping mall food and a big cup of Grigio."}
{"text":"Decent Asian-style food; not authentic but not bad.  Pot stickers were straight out of a bag and deep friend -- more the Japanese style dumplings, not really pot stickers. Entrees were pretty tasty, although my Thai cashew entree came with peanuts and not a cashew in sight. I sent it back and it returned with cashews chopped into tiny pieces... and some more peanuts too. Chopped cashews aren't really the way to go for full flavor, but the dish wasn't bad. My wife's Korean-inspired dish was a bit more successful. As far as ambiance goes, it's a chain and feels like a chain. When you're greeted with the words, \"We're a new concept out of Atlanta,\" you know what you're going to get. By they way, it's a sit-down restaurant on the weekends, and cafeteria-style on the weekdays."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Asian food cuisine this is not the place to go to. The food is over priced & of poor quality. I went to Mama Fu's after work one evening for dinner and was very disappointed. When I entered the restaurant I was not greeted and to be frankly honest didn't know whether I needed to sit down at a table to have someone take my order or if I needed to go to the front counter to place my order. When I finally did figure out that I needed to go to the counter to place my order I sat down and waited for my food to arrive. The food arrived in less than five minutes and the server brought my food without bringing out eating utensils! When I asked the server for a fork she said \" Oh you do need a fork? \" Last time I checked civilized people do not eat a rice dish with their hands. When she did bring the fork and I was finally able to eat my food I realized that the food was luke warm and just plain tasteless ( I ordered the Red Thai Curry Dish) That particular dish was supposed to be spicy and had no taste what so ever. I left the restaurant sorely disappointed and $10.00 dollars poorer!"}
{"text":"Tried for first time and came away impressed.  It's not gourmet, but it's a great place for a quick bite that's a step between a pricier joint and take out.   The food was fresh and surprisingly tasty.  The server had no problems with the custom orders our group threw at him.  The menu isn't adventurous but the  Pad Thai,  Basil Spring Rolls and even our kid's Fried Rice was pretty good and came in large portions that provided lunch the next day. The stir fry was light and fresh and wasn't drowning in sauce.   It's right outside the Great Northern movie theatre so it's definitely going to be a spot we go to before a family movie."}
{"text":"Super quick for takeout, with a variety of Asian fusion options. The food is so-so, but satisfies if you need a quick fix in a hurry!"}
{"text":"I have tried to get on board with the food here many times, as my boyfriend orders it for work. I have tried many dishes but she feel something is lacking. I do like the spring rolls but mostly for the dipping sauce. I took my son to dinner tonight to try the dine-in option. His meal was ok- the sweet chicken and Mac-n-chz (but how could anyone not get that right). The staff looked annoyed- all of them- not one person smiling. Took them 5 minutes of me standing at the front for one of them to drag themselves away from whatever they were doing. While I am at it, the lighting is awful- totally too bright and the track lights point right in the diners' eyes. The food is not BAD, it's just not that great. And it is pricey. Sorry..."}
{"text":"Out of shrimp, out of beef, out of spring rolls. Out of patience, soon I predict out of business.   Despite being basically \"out\" of everything we were anticipating ordering the food was mediocre at best. Service was poor and we were like the only table here. Potstickers steamed were the best item we had. Pad Thai tasted like vinegar Thai and despite the menu saying cilantro was an ingredient there wasn't any in there. We had to get a side of cilantro and add it in ourselves 15 minutes after being served by flagging down a busboy?   More like Mama Poos.  We should've known better than to try this place, can't imagine them being open more than 6 months at this rate. I mean, how do you eff up a noodle bowl?   We didn't eat even half of our meals before we got tired of the waitress disappearing while workers were found just hanging out so we asked to speak with the manager. We waited at the table long enough to get up and find the manager ourselves. We explained our frustration with the food and service, he looked at us just kind of dazed. It was a bit awkward and finally he just said, \"would you like to just leave and not pay?\" We took him up on the offer and he replied, \"thanks for giving us a try.\" Wow."}
{"text":"We got the Thai Shrimp app,(not that great... should have got the Calamari) Good thing that was free otherwise I'd been mad. Because paying 7.45 for 7 pieces of fried Shrimp on top of some veggies in a martini glass is highway robbery! My wife had the Pad Thai with tofu and pork(Which was actually good). I had the Pho soup with beef (Big mistake, worse Pho I've ever had. The broth was either mixed with to much mint and soy sauce, the bean sprouts were already put in the soup in excess, might have been more bean sprouts then noodles.... it was just nasty) The waiter came and ask how it was and I was brutally honest. Manager then came over and asked me if I'd like something else, I ended up getting Shrimp Tofu Pad Thai which was pretty good. If not for the great service I wouldn't even think about going back... They had a $9 Bah Mi Sandwich that came with sweet potato strips, But after he told me it was like a 6 inch sub it kinda turned me off.... if i'm gonna pay $9 for a Bah Mi it better be the best ever... I knew something was bad when next door \"The Rail\"another new restaurant was packed with people waiting for tables. While there were maybe 1 other customer at Mama Fu's...."}
{"text":"My Aunt and I stopped here after a movie for a glass of wine. We sat at the bar. The restaurant was manned by a skeleton crew, with few patrons in the restaurant. Odd for a Friday evening. We shared chicken lettuce wraps, which came with a delightful plum-ish tasting sauce and the shrimp orange peel entree, which came with lots of shrimp and was fabulous tasting. The bartender was nice enough, but service was a bit slow. Will definitely return! The bartender said that next week they will be offering 'dinner and a movie' for $15 a person...worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because it's a chain, maybe I was more in the mood for authentic Asian cuisine, maybe I hit it on an off day...I don't know, but I am certainly not a fan.  I had the sesame, but I just found it all to be very bland.  My partner ordered the fried rice and thought the same thing.  Additionally, the portion sizes were pretty small for the price (we spent over $20), which is just too much to pay for flavorless food.  The place was clean, the staff was decently friendly, and food did not take terribly long to cook.  These were really the positives of our experience.  Still, I'd rather spend my money at a more authentic place, I suppose.  I just don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Different...but in the vein of Pei Wei and Noodles & Co.  Enjoyed my Vietnamese Crunchy noodles with shrimp and asked for extra hot sauce. Essentially had a deep fried dish with some veggies stirred in and the hot sauce is like a sweet & sour salsa.  Like I said, different. Spouse had yellow curry chicken, it was fair but I would have needed a lot more hot sauce. We also got crab rangoons which were really good. The sauce for the rangoons was sweet and gingery. Would love to try more items here."}
{"text":"2nd time here for lunch. Really good food. I'm having the Spicy General Fu (had a noodle bowl last time). The sauce is a lot sweeter than I normally like but the chicken is cooked perfectly.  Menu says its spicy but I wouldn't call it that (I like spicy food).   Good rice, broccoli and carrots.   Little pricey but with with this location there's not much competition in this level of quality."}
{"text":"Well I only go here because of Mimi and her husband.  They use to own Thai Cuisine on Independence. The best Thai food in Charlotte.  If you go to Mama Fu's you can get the husband to fix some items like he use to fix in his restaurant.  The best sticky-rice and Mango in Charlotte.  But you also have to get to know the asst manager Bridgette.  What a sweet girl and she is on top of her game when it comes to customer service."}
{"text":"Nothing that I ate here blew me away but it's better than food court food any day.    The Bahn Mi sandwich is quite spicy so keep that in mind if you decide to order it.  The fried rice is just OK.   The service was poor (our waitress was either a newbie or just flat out careless).  She did not know the menu well, she could not suggest food options, she would forget to check on us, we had to request refills on several occasions, and the list goes on and on.    The best thing about this place is that they have vegetarian and gluten free menus;)"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! Stopped here for lunch - 1st visit! Service great ( Derek was our server) Food great, good price, nice decor.... Check it out!"}
{"text":"It's o.k.  Asian, but not better than average Chinese Food Take Out.  Not better than Nothing but Noodles or Noodles and Company if you want a variety of flavors."}
{"text":"Mama Fu's is an interesting concept - they offer quick food that's really pretty good.  Most dishes offer noodles of some sort or another, but our favorites are the lettuce wraps, which are nothing more than chopped chicken served with pieces of lettuce for, well, wrapping up the chicken.  Think of it like fajitas and you're most of the way there.  You order at the counter, get a number (usually one trillion and something), then a server will deliver the food shortly thereafter.  They also have dishes for kids that are less spicy and more kid-friendly, so take them along.  Our kids love it, which is a bit odd in the world of non-hamburger joints."}
{"text":"First-time visit and not impressed with food quality.   Ordered the Pork Roll appetizer - Crisp, although very greasy, outside. inside ingredients tasty, although thicker doughy roll.  Also ordered the Fried Rice entree with extra chicken. Half the chicken was tough and dried out. Rice was ok, very little broccoli and egg. not the best choice.  An extra star for the good customer service and pleasant staff who were knowledgeable of the menu. Restaurant was not busy and received very good, quick customer service. It is a franchise and feels like a chain, although still a decent ambiance. Good variety of items on the menu.   There are better asian food quality choices in the area.  Decent Asian-style food; not authentic but not bad.   May try again and order from their 'black menu'."}
{"text":"While I was here for a CMYE (where they served some delicious fare) I also took some time and carried out from Mama Fu's.   Inside Mama's is bright and colorful with ample table space and even a comfy booth if you're waiting for your food to go. Employees are all very sweet, smiley and helpful. It's especially nice to see how many regulars they have here! I noticed the manager greeting many of them by first name. Sweet!   Items you must try:  Basil spring rolls: 4/5: Very fresh and healthy rolls accompanied by great peanut sauce.   Lettuce wraps: 5/5: I have so many friends that swear by PF Changs' lettuce wraps but these would challenge them! Flavorful chicken diced with a myriad of spices envelopes in a large piece of lettuce. That's what dreams are made of, friends.   Special crunchy noodle dish: 3/5: This dish was a special for the evening - a mammoth portion of crunchy (fried? sautéed?) noodles with carrots, snap peas and chicken. The flavors were well rounded and I loved the idea of a crunchy noodle. The issue on this one was the carry out as the sauce took much away from the crunch as I traveled home. Regardless, I would definitely order this again if I was eating in house!   Next time I'm in Cotswold and hear my stomach a rumblin' I'll definitely get my Fu fix!"}
{"text":"Average is generous. I don't think I will be back anytime soon. Many better options for $10-12 lunch"}
{"text":"Great spot for family's! Kids eat for .99 Wed and Sat nights! We love Mama Fu's and have been eating here weekly for over a year now! We have 3 kids and there is no where that we can all eat for under $30 except at Mama Fu's! The food is wonderful, service is GREAT and it's a family type atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend if you like Chinese and have kids to feed."}
{"text":"I'd like to give 3.5 stars but I'll bump up for the service.  Ate there tonight (a Tuesday night, so somewhat slow) and got some basil/curry tofu dish with brown rice. The service was very quick (and the cashier was great, even checked in on me during my meal). The food was decent - nothing mind-blowing and not the most authentic (I would try Thai taste or one of the Vietnamese restaurants on Central if you're looking for authentic in Charlotte at a comparable price) but still pretty good. It's convenient and have never had a bad meal there. Should check if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Lunch well spent at Mama Fu's!!   When I first walked in, I could honestly say that I was taken aback by the whole set up.  Did i just walk into Pei Wei?? I truly wasn't expecting to walk in and have to order from the counter.  Nonetheless, me and my lunch buddies (whom have never been there either) had a great lunch. Ordered wonton soup and it came in a ginormous bowl. Spring rolls were yum and made a good little addition to my low cal lunch.  My lunch cost was $12 and I gasped a little when she told me the total.  So the prices are ...eh...not what I expected.    THAT is all... ;)"}
{"text":"A gem hidden behind great northern mall. No mall entrance but by sears and new movie theater. Concept may throw you off at first, but I love a healthier option to Chinese that's quick and yummy. Good spice, great firm tofu in my green curry. Lunch trio portion was too big for me. Great iced tea. Cooked fresh to order, quick, nice staff who explained everything. And they deliver! I'll come back after we order delivery to rate again...also vegan and gluten free options. And choice of brown, white, or fried rice."}

{"text":"Ordered the Crab Rangoon & Wonton Soup. The Crab Rangoon was a little greasy and too creamy tat the crab was overwhelmed. As for the soup, the wontons were pretty good, and a large portion which was nice."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Mama Fu's. I'm a fan of any Asian fusion restaurants, and the thought of a make-your-own bowl experience entices me. Mama Fu's just didn't deliver. I will say that the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was trendy and clean. The menu was like something out of a fairy tale; an array of meat/veggie/sauce combinations with plenty of vegetarian or gluten free options. The fairy tale did not have a happy ending, unfortunately. The food just wasn't satisfying.   My S.O. and I started with the pork spring rolls. They were tasty, but nothing special. I'm pretty sure they were just picked out of a frozen bag and ferried to the deep fryer. I ordered a vegetable pad thai bowl, while he ordered a spicy basil bowl. The word \"meh\" immediately came to mind as I took my first bite. First off, the noodles are closer to buckwheat noodles than rice noodles; they have a gritty texture and a hearty aftertaste. My second major problem was that the sauce was overpowering and quite sour. One of the things I love about Asian food is how you can taste so many different flavors in one dish. The vegetables, noodles, and tofu just tasted like the sauce. After taking a few bites, I was wondering where the tofu was. I shifted my noodles around to uncover these thin morsels that resembled two-month old portobello slices. I actually had to pick up a piece with my fork and inspect it closely to discover it was tofu. I think perhaps they wanted their tofu to resemble meat, but it was dry like a piece of tofu jerky and completely tasteless.   The basil bowl was slightly tastier than my pad thai, but still had the unfortunate quality of a uniform taste for the entire meal.   Mama Fu's might be an alright place to visit if you need an alternative to food court Chinese, but expect a very underwhelming meal."}
{"text":"It's just exactly what I wanted.  Waltzed in for lunch with a friend this week and was stoked to see so many veggie-friendly options. I went for a favorite stand-by: veggie pad thai. Perfect. I threw on a little Siracha and was good to go.  My friend got the chicken satay with some cucumbers/veggies on the side. Despite my fear and loathing of consuming meat, it looked like it was probably delicious. My friend attested to that.  Very reasonable for the amount of food you're served.  Service is great, too. Walk up, order, take a number and you're on your way. Drinks at the soda fountain.  It's simple and straightforward. I appreciated that a staff member came to whisk away our plates when we were finished, leaving us with a virtually clean table over which to continue our lunchtime chat.  Overall this is an ideal spot for a quick lunch and dependably good food."}
