{"text":"This place was surprisingly good. The bowls of photos were very tasty and the shrimp and chicken spring roles were addictive.  Have been back a few times and it's been consistent."}
{"text":"Used to be Krispy Roll.   Updated menu but still fantastic food and service!  Quiet and cozy with friendly staff and owners that remember you when you come in."}
{"text":"Totally hidden in a strip mall kind of place but if you are looking for decent viet or Thai this is not a bad choice and there aren't a whole lotta other decent places in the Golden Mile strip of Eglinton. Not sure what this place is called as the name seems to have changed a few times.   We ordered a rare beef pho (huge bowl for medium) a veggie spring roll (pretty good) and a beef chicken pork on rice with two fried sunny side up eggs. The meat was solid and the egg was a nice touch which I hadn't seen in this dish before. It came with a small soup (just the pho broth so nothing special) and a small salad which was ok. The only thing I would have liked would be a bit of cooked veggies. Still a good meal great value and I will be back."}
