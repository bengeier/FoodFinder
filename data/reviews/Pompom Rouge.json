{"text":"Very glad to try this hidden gem situated in a Laval area which I always overlooked just because the vibe I got when driving through there was not more than a \"Meh whatever, step on it so we're outa here\". Ordinary neighbourhood with nothing much to see around, subpar commerces here and there and buildings showing their age. But..... starting today, when driving on Boul. Concorde, close to this spot, I'll always think of this nice and cozy restaurant and hopefully the timing will be right so to stop by and sample one more item on their menu.   I ordered the Taiwanese ravioli as an entré and the chicken kimchi ramen. Perfect homemade tender dough for the ravioli that's stuffed with three kinds of meat sitting atop a light broth like sauce. Right there I knew the reviews were not exaggerated and also had a feeling my main course would be even better than the entre.   The kimchi soup was just a wohaa!! The broth is  unlike the docile Pho. Here you get an action filled bad boy, naturally different than its well behaved cousin, more zest, tang and of course kimchi itself is right there in your soup. Fried crispy skin chicken balls, poached egg and other goodies that went down my belly unnoticed. A nice gentle kind of kick in your mouth that you'll want more and more of it to be delivered until not your mouth but stomach tells you to stop! It's a must have if you like your food hot and spicy. I asked for extra spicy as per Jason M's recommendation and it was just awesome. At this spiciness level, adding more hot sauce would be an overkill and also would destroy its taste, leaving your mouth with only a burning sensation... so don't add any please.   Thanks again to Yelp reviews and the friends here for their input. I wouldn't have considered going here without checking first with them. But now, It  is a place I'd visit often and also bring my family to discover more goodies for sure! Hands down to the husband and wife who run this beautiful and affordable place. Keep up the good job!"}
{"text":"Très très bon :) serviable, authentique, frais ! Mangez tel quel, sans adaptation, faites confiance à la cuisine. Découvert grâce à Yelp. On retient. Bon endroit en laissant passer le trafic du soir ..."}
{"text":"Omg so good!! The service is amazing, they're very sweet. It's also very vegetarian friendly :) definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch to try it out. Cute and clean restaurant. Love their decor (mostly red with a touch of Asian design)! A little parking lot available at the back.  We ordered the pan fried dumplings, fried chicken, the Taiwanese pork bun and their speciality sautéed noodle. It all tasted really good and flavourful. Was looking around for spicy sauce, when asked, she gave us their house made one which is pretty strong!  Went with my toddler who couldn't get enough of their dumplings. Baby friendly place with high chairs available.  The owners were pleasant, attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch and we're pleased to find a super clean restaurant, decent lunch specials with very nicely presented dishes. Sadly, the food itself was bland and tasted like typical \"buffet food. It's possibly due to the dishes we had having a generic, bland taste. The rice that came with our General Tao was more like oatmeal. Maybe it's supposed to be served that way but we didn't care for it at all. The potential is here for something very nice but even with a big kitchen and a \"chef\", everything taster like it was from frozen.  They obviously invested in the decor, now do so with the cooking."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé ce resto. Les ingrédients sont frais, de qualité et tout est fraîchement préparé.  Probablement la meilleure soupe WonTon que j'ai mangé. Les Gua Bao sont délicieux. J'ai essayé ceux au porc qui était tendre et savoureux. Le chou fermenté rajoute une touche vinaigrée qui complémente parfaitement la viande. Nous avons aussi essayé le buf et crevettes sur la plaque en fonte. La viande est tendre, fraîche et de bonne qualité. Les crevettes et les légumes étaient abondants et la sauce délicieuse. Je conseille de partager ce plat.  Seule déception est que les propriétaires ont dû adapter certains plats au goût de la clientèle, ce qui signifie que l'authenticité en souffre un peu.  Je ne comprends pas la mention de \"cuisine fusion\" pour ce resto. C'est plutôt une \"cuisine compromis\".  SVP, lorsque que vous mangez dans un resto taïwanais, ne commandez pas de Phad Thaï et de grâce, n'ajoutez pas de sauce soja dans la soupe. C'est déjà assaisonné.  Demandez plutôt les spécialités de la maison et laissez-vous surprendre!"}
{"text":"Great find in Laval.  Real cheap, taxes are included in the prices. You can eat under 15$ taxes included.  The quality is there. The food have an authentic feel. The portion aren't huge. But come on take your plate with the dumpling entree. It's dirt cheap!  And the hot sweet grapefruit tea was great!"}
{"text":"Awesome find! They claim to have the best general tao chicken in town and I probably agree! The other stuff we tried were great too and service was quick and sweet despite the constant Uber eats rush. I would like to point out that the restaurant is ridiculously chilly. @Management - please turn the heat up!"}
{"text":"Pompom Rouge recently opened in this area and they provide patrons with a variety of Asian styled dishes such as BBQ pork with fried rice, pad thai, general tao... pretty tame stuff but can have a lot of success in this area.  I craved their BBQ pork with fried rice but they ran out as a previous patron cleaned them out ordering a bunch of food. In a way, that bolds well for this business and I HAD TO COME BACK FOR IT!!!  I usually would have went with the safe General Tao but I went with their Pad Thai and Won Ton soup. The food was presented in beautiful bowls which matched its modern and pretty interior. The Won Ton soup was very good and worth the $2 price-tag. The Pad Thai (with chicken or shrimp) was very good and I enjoyed it. For $12, this is a solid lunch option for me in the future.  But...  I CAME BACK.. THAT'S RIGHT... BACK FOR THAT BBQ PORK!!!!  So, I took their new lunch special and POM POM ROUGE BBQ PORK + WON TON SOUP + SIDE SALAD for $10!!!! And... it was soooooo good. The BBQ was expertly prepared and the rice was a perfect companion. I ate like a champ. Sooooooo good!!!  Kudos to this small family run place, I'll be sure to come here often."}
{"text":"great pork fried rice . new place that just opened up. been waiting for a great Asian place now I got one near by. Good prices nice people I would come back for sure"}
{"text":"I was invited by a local Laval Yelper to come on out to this sweet new spot by de La Concorde metro because, as he put it, the food is delicious and the people are super nice and he wants to support them. This, as you may know, is one of the keys to my heart, and so I was happy to go. And even happier to discover that PomPom Rouge is indeed a bright, clean lovely little light in a suburban strip. The young couple that own it and make the Taiwanese and Chinese food - Paul and Rebecca - are super funny, friendly and passionate about their food and customers. They knew everyone in there, and everyone who called for delivery personally.   Most importantly, the food. We started with dumplings in a soup broth. Big fat chicken and shrimp dumplings made fresh - delicious fresh dumpling dough is hard to beat, especially when dripping with light right soup broth and spicy think savoury dipping sauce. My friend ate his favourite, the fried rice with pork and corn, which I tasted and was great, not too heavy or oily, and I ordered a Taiwanese vegetarian dish with soft awesome eggplant, crispy awesome tofu, onion, garlic and peppers in a delicious thick homemade broth served with rice. Super nice, clearly made fresh with good ingredients.   I look forward to coming back, I liked the clean tasteful decor and the very yummy food and the super kind, cool people. If you are in the area go have a tasty inexpensive meal and give them some love!"}
{"text":"Authentic Taiwan food... No soya sauce needed (very tasty).  Good menu selection; very good service.  Reasonably priced.  Will come here again"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and now I'm ready to say how much I love this place . Pom pom Rouge is great asinine food nice people . I'll keep coming back"}
{"text":"Once again used yelp to locate this great Thai fusion restaurant and very glad I did. Service was fast and friendly with my waiter checking back several times plus gave me heads up about the home made hot sauce. I had the best won ton soup I've ever had plus the chicken with crispy noodles. Shame on me for not bringing my own beer and wine. Parking was fine with space located behind the restaurant. Decor was light and cheery too. I will definitely use this restaurant as regular stop in place when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the trip from Chateauguay!! Not disappointed at all. I started with a bowl of won ton soup and it is the best one I had ever. There is a secret sauce that goes with the soup and It goes well with the dumplings. They make the dumplings in house and definitely taste fresh. I had the pork fried rice and just by the looks it definitely fooled me. I thought it would have no flavor but boy was I wrong big time, it is packed full of flavor and very tasty. Staff is very friendly and make you feel welcomed. The decor is nice, bright and open, very clean tables and utensils.   The only thing I worry is that the location makes it a little hidden and it would be a shame to miss it.   Do yourself a favor and definitely check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"petite découverte grâce à des amis yelp élite. après avoir lu leur review,  J'ai décidé d'essayer.  Nous sommes allez une journée où il faisait -15 dehors.  Il faisait pas super chaud dans le restaurant,  Nous avons du conserver nos manteau.   la qualité des aliments est remarquable. que ce soit les sauces,  épices,  viandes ou légumes,  tout est frais et de qualité.  En plus c'est sans msg.   J'ai pris le combo soupe et rouleau impériaux.  tout était vraiment bon.   comme repas,  j'ai pris le général tao sur riz sauté. le poulet était vraiment de grande qualité,  parfaitement cuit,  pas gras,  juste assez denrobage. par contre,  j'ai trouvé que la sauce n'avais pas de goût et était pas très présente. ma compagne,  pour sa part,  ma indiqué que c'était le meilleur qu'elle à goûter avec moi.   Le tout pour moins de 20$, c'est vraiment bon et abordable.    l'étoile perdu est un ensemble du fait que le resto est froid et le manque de saveur pour la sauce. sinon,  c'est vraiment à essayer"}
{"text":"This is more of an update to my review I still love this place and thinks it deserves 5 stars . I just want to let you know there lunch special for 10$ is no longer there . Read my older review for the rest of details"}
