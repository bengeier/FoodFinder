{"text":"Really nice to find another small cafe raising the bar in Calgary.  Crepes and coffee were very good and the service was friendly and professional.  Sign says new management, not sure what was going on there before. We'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Quaint and delightful. Great coffee, great food, great staff, great atmosphere!  Very accommodating with our two little ones as well. Highly recommended, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Very basic, scrambled egg crepe. I prefer more sauce, meat and cheese this was quite plain. My daughter had the waffle with ice cream and nuts, it was good."}
{"text":"This establishment has finally pressed on my last nerve.  I was appalled today by the way the owner treated my friend and our two 1 year old boys.  We came in to get a coffee and escape the rain.  Our first impression was friendly and we received our coffee and muffin without any delay.  It was when we turned around to take a seat that we were told we couldn't sit there as we were in the way of the counter and furthermore we had ordered take away coffees.  We were surprised and sputtered that we weren't staying for very long.  Fine fine she said.  We sat down and pulled out some snacks for the little ones and began to drink our coffee.  At this point she snapped at us that we were not allowed to bring any outside food and beverage into her restaurant as it is against Alberta health services.  In fact we can't bring in our own water.  This was news to me!  We asked to have our coffees returned since we obviously weren't welcome and she said of course not because we had taken a sip of our drink.  It was then that we left and let her know that we wouldn't be back as her customer service is beyond undesirable.  I am disappointed that the owner chooses to treat her customers this way.  I will drive out of my way to get coffee from now on."}
{"text":"A sweet little place with a cheerful atmosphere. However, the food and the prices left a bit to be desired. I ordered the Baby Got Back savoury crepe (eggs, back bacon, and havarti filling) topped with hollandaise), which was around $12. From the menu description I expected a thick layer of back bacon throughout the crepe and a hearty spoonful of hollandaise. Unfortunately the crepe I got was mostly scrambled eggs with very tiny cubes of back bacon mixed in and a little drizzle of hollandaise on top, which (although the crepe was still yummy) left me disappointed. I also had a chai latte, while my mom had an Americano misto. Both were enjoyable but again pricey - $4.75 for the chai latte and in the $4-5 dollar range for the Americano misto, which I believe is more expensive than Starbucks.

This cafe and crepery has potential to go from good to great, but they have some work to do."}
{"text":"I Came to this caffe at 9am on a Monday morning, within their normal hours of operation. No lights were on and they were closed. Needless to say, we are upset we drove across town to try this place out. Not a very successful business plan in our opinion but hey, some people just like to watch the world burn."}
{"text":"Lovely little breakfast nook with tasty meals.  Definitely taste the freshness.  Just don't expect your food to come out quickly so its a sit and relax and chill kind of place.  Decent sized portions but on an above average price."}
{"text":"My party decided to eat here and they were able to accommodate us outside. She took our beverage orders and returned with everything we ordered. However, patrons that only order water received a opened bottle of water and a glass. They were expecting tap water but they are now expected to pay for a bottle of water.

One of my other friends joined us later and decided to order from the front counter and joined us outside. She told the cashier (which we assume is the owner) that she well have her drink to stay.  She was then told she could not stay to have her coffee because the seating is reserved for patrons that order food and/or drink. There is nothing in the establishment that indicated this. 

While paying for the meals another friend who ordered a milkshake ($4.90) wanted to pay with his card. The cashier (the same individual who we assume is the owner) did not approve of this possibly to avoid visa charges for just a \"low\" order. 

Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and for coffee a number of times. It's a small menu of tasty crepes and waffles (I think), some sweet, some savoury. I've tried all the crepes, and enjoyed them all. The food is fresh, good sized servings--good value! Special coffees, they use real whipping cream. Nice touch.

If you're really in the mood for a decadent treat--i forget the name of it, but its like an icecream parfait with fresh fruit and a shot (or 2) of espresso. This was outstanding!"}
{"text":"It could be a great little community hot spot as a coffee shop with good food. However don't think about just going for a coffee as you'll be asked to leave. I live in the community and took a business client there today at 11. We were told it was a breakfast restaurant and we weren't welcome to stay without food. This with less than a third of the tables taken. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Small privately owned cafe. Brand new equipment and top quality coffee grinder and espresso bar. The owner is a kind lady who cares about the food she is preparing. She's learning about the food industry and appreciated our feedback about the food. I think it's important to support our city and our small business owners rather than just going to the easy choice big corporations. Overall good food, good smoothie, quiet and peaceful atmosphere. I would love to see this place in a few months and see how much they've progressed"}
{"text":"Another visit and another very rude experience. This time she was telling off a gentleman who seems un rattled by her. He used a gentle tone as with a child in a tantrum. Lol
She is closed for flooding; perhaps karma?"}
{"text":"Meh!!! Pretty lack luster. Had the procutto crepe and there was barely any holinsaise sauce on it so it was quite dry. I ordered coffee and water she brought bottled water which was not what I asked for she didn't even ask if I wanted tap or bottled. My Crepe was the only thing on the plate so I left still hungry. And when I went to pay the bill it was 18$ for nothing. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced breakfast that was served quickly. The service was friendly and prompt. Good cappuccino and coffee. The savory crepes were kind of bland. Basically just some scrambled eggs in a wrap."}
{"text":"Tried to order a crepe with meat on the side (as I'm veg) and was told \"no, if your vegetarian you can have this one\". So she placed my order for me. Not impressed, as it was filled with goat cheese which I do not like. She also forgot my friends coffee, until she was reminded and brought it after we were done eating. Food was sub par, and for almost $40 for 2 people, I found it really expensive. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"The staff are always friendly and lovely. Simple little place with delicious crepes. A hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome. Nice clean and cozy spot with a nice neighbourhood atmosphere. I had the banana crepe and it was delicious, comes with a huge dollop of whipped cream drizzled with chocolate, just awesome. Excellent service and fair pricing. When your in Lakeview, it's definitely the place to check out"}
