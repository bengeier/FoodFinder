{"text":"I go to NDBC at least once a week. The staff are always so nice and can recommend new brews that I would like. The house cocktail is the Moscow mule in the copper mugs, which are great when you're not in the mood for beer. (It can happen!) The food is so good, and the reason I'm finally leaving a review today is HOLY CRAP the new brunch menu is awesome. I had the pork belly eggs Benedict and my partner and I shared a delightful scone. NDBC has a strong potato game on all fronts and the hash was excellent. The cheese curds are fantastic too!"}
{"text":"I was happy to learn that another local brewery was opening in the east side, and that it was touted as family-friendly. I have been twice, both with my child, and the wait staff is very kind to my child and prepares off-menu items like grilled cheese.  The beer is tasty, but the downfalls are the food and lighting. The food is only OK, and priced as it is, for our party of three eating an appetizer, two beers and three meals, was more than $60. The space is nicely divided, but the lighting seems overly fluorescent and more can be done to make the space seem more homier? Like a tavern? Like a restaurant? It's hard to read. I think a menu and ingredients tweak and lighting expert will make this place a regular haunt for us. Until then, I am lucky enough to be close to Tip Top Tavern and Alchemy."}
{"text":"Look, I'll start with the positives: Wait staff is nice and attentive, and the fries here are really good. For the price, in fact, they're the best thing on the menu. Other fare is only so-so. It's not bad, per se, but not mind blowing. What I'm not a fan of is the beer. Madison has a fair share of breweries with really good beer and really good food. (One, hint hint, is on the east side close to the airport.) This beer isn't great, and there's no options for legit cocktails. They have some sort of variant, where you can get an \"Old Fashioned\" with some odd fermented...drink. Whatever. This is Wisconsin. Having decent fries and decent cheese curds isn't enough, when so many other places have that AND Great Beer AND Great cocktails."}
{"text":"Well...I have given this place enough tries. There is just something missing at Next Door it seems at every level. The staff seem unhappy for some reason each time I've gone.  The beer is not bad but again...its missing that magic that great beers have though the packaging is nice. Another brewery up the street greet you with smiles and the beer is fantastic. The decor at next door is well done and the bathrooms are clean. The food is fair but nothing that makes you go WOW! I have to have that again. Its also rather pricey. Its sad really...I want to love Next Door Brewing because I support local...but Im afraid im done. I hope they get better management and fix these multitude of minor issues. Good Luck."}
{"text":"Happy to have this place in our neighborhood, but they've got some bugs to work out.   We went there two consecutive nights (Friday and  Saturday). Friday just to try their beer and appetizers. Saturday for entrees.   Friday I would have given place 2 stars, but they redeemed themselves a little on Saturday to get 3. Not awesome but tons of room for improvement.  Positive: The service was great both nights. Seating options are well-designed. We like the communal seating at big and long tables, but there are options for private tables, a softball team area (the hipsters had claimed this area on Friday, and it was great to see them giving the place a chance), and bar seats too. Menu seems thoughtful. WPA (wheat pale ale?) is really nice. Local ingredients seem to be a priority. The Ssam Pork sandwich is really good with its kimchi slaw. Really nice logo, and great revitalization of a former dead space on Atwood Ave. OH, and the ketchup that that came with the fries - ! - thank you for not calling in Heinz. That $?!+ is awesome, but not quite the hook you need to get people back.  Negative: Dim the lights for christsake! It  feels more like Perkins than a neighborhood tavern. The cheese curds made us both a little ill - too greazy and the cheese is too soft (have the Baerwolf family at Sassy Cow advise you on a firmer cheese for deep frying, and densify your batter so it doesn't hold so much of the oil). It's also quite noisy. Two large rooms with hard walls, ceiling and floor make it an echo chamber and a little hard to talk unless you have good bar yell. Install some kind of noise dampening finishes.   We'll be back, but we'll give them some time to work out some of the newbie problems."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This place is new and I've only been once. I am optimistic that things will improve.  The beer is solid. And if you sit at the bar, service is speedy. The food was less impressive. I just went with a basic burger, because it's a staple that every bar should be able to handle. What I got was an overcooked burger and overcooked fries. Given the price tag ($9), that was a major disappointment.  I was also disappointed in the total lack of ambiance. The tables are basically spread around one big room, with the bar partly separated by a wall. There are no soft surfaces or wall hangings, so it's also extremely loud. The overall effect is that you never forget that you're in a basic cinder-block building.  I am giving it a 3/5 because they are hitting the rights marks with their beer, which is the most important thing for a brewing company. And I know they're brainstorming how to address the noise issue. So I'm sure those things will get remedied. Still, the kitchen will have to really step up their game if this is to become notable establishment."}
{"text":"Next Door's brews are both diverse and true to type, which is my primary criterion as far as the beer is concerned.  The atmosphere in this joint is exactly what you could ask of a neighborhood place and is both welcoming and reasonable in its presentation of TV screens, music, etc. at the right times.  The vittles are varied and you can usually find something that works, or at least we can.  I won't go into detail, but these people are running a beer and food business rather than just trying to reach the lowest common denominator to rake in the cash.  They deserve five stars based on some of the ratings you have given other brew pubs around the area."}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times this year...AND ITS ALWAYS AMAZING!!!! Great food and beer. I usually get the pulled pork and it never dissapoints! The burgers, fries and poutine appetizer is also very very good!! QUALITY BREW PUB"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Came here while doing a brewery tour in Madison, and this place had the best beers in he area. We dislike IPA beers and most of the other breweries has a majority of IPA on tap. We ordered a flight of their 11 beers, and honestly it was delicious. Our favorites were Livacious and Hobbolange. We ordered their fries just to have a munch on something fatty and the fries were delish as well. Wish we tried the food out here, drinking beer all day doesn't exactly make you hungry, but there is always next time."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here. Had the wpa, which was a cross between a pale ale and an IPA. Food was excellent- had the veggie tostada and the white bean burger (a special that day but hope they keep it). Both were tasty!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of what Ale Asylum used to be, but with better food. Their Eastside is on of the BEST beers I've had! !!!! I had the fish sandwich and it was lightly breaded exposing the real taste. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"-beer at bar - fast. -grabbing a table and waiting 20 minutes before flagging down the one waitstaff - not so good. -food solid, beer solid -four tables full, not busy, hassling for service - rather comical."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes to be served. Picked up and left and they didn't even notice; told us to have a good night. Not busy, not even 1/3 capacity and plenty of wait staff. Went to Karben4 and we're served immediately. Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"Gone in for a date night, excellent service, awesome food(cheese curds were out of this world!) beer was very tasty, and our food was delicious. Unexpected twists on classics. Will put this on our \"return\" list."}
{"text":"I am so glad that we didn't order more from them. We had the mixed shishkabob plate, the sausage and kraut balls, and split the Atwood burger. My partner had a beer. The shishkabobs were under-seasoned and over cooked, the only one either of us enjoyed at all was the sausage one, probably because you can't mess up sausage too badly. The burger was the same story. They advertise onions and caraway seeds and other yummies on that burger. What came out of the kitchen was an undersized patty with a few caraway seeds in the entire thing and a tiny smudge of onions on top. We expected something much more flavorful and powerful. The beer, I was told was excellent for the first few sips and then started to leave a bad taste in his mouth. A third of the way through the glass and he would have thrown it away if we had been at home. Now those things I could forgive for a new place but here is the kicker. The pork sausage and sauerkraut were over done on the outside and raw on the inside. When I told the waiter to let the kitchen staff know that their frier was too hot (I have been frying for 10 years), he let them know and then came back and told us that the balls were supposed to be pink on the inside. I'm curious. How can a product comprised of a brown or green vegetable and a meat that is brown when properly cooked, be pink unless it was raw? Not only is that wrong, but that is a safety issue. We will not be going back and we will not be recommending it to anyone. Save yourself some money and possibly illness and avoid this place."}
{"text":"This place was a great find for a Sunday afternoon lunch. I had the sassy bird chicken sandwich which was delicious! It has Brie cheese and this orange sauce that made the sandwich perfectly unique and delicious!   My boyfriend had the monte cristo sandwich off of the brunch menu, which was yummy but what really made the plate was the grilled & salted red skin potatoes and a mustardy, horseradishy, raspberry vinigarette! Holy yum!   The atmosphere was nice and I really liked the music they had on on the background (Nora jones style).  Waitstaff was nice and had good recommendations for foods to try.   Only drawbacks I could find....  I thought the appetizers were unfairly priced. I would have liked to try the fried cheese curds or the poutine but the cost of those was almost as must as my sandwich meal. If they dropped the price of these a bit my rating would be a full 5 stars! :-  Overall, I really liked this place and will go back for another visit!"}
{"text":"Came here with the bestie on a weekend for dinner and beers.  As many others have stated, service is slow as fuuuuuuuuuuuuuk, food is mediocre and the bartender was rude and weird.  Hated the table set up, nearly went deaf from the sound.  Had to talk pretty loud in the dining room.   Probably won't go back.  Too many other places in Madison to explore.  The only good part was the beer, I thought it was quite tasty and strong."}
{"text":"We thought they had a few too many IPAs on tap, but all the beer was brewed well. The non-IPAs are the most unique. The Busy Bee Ale was  Amazing! We went on a crowed Friday night which was fun.  I had the Mac n cheese which was bland but a friend ordered the cheese curds which were great!"}
{"text":"We go to Next Door every Thursday nite for their two for one beers, but more importantly to see our favorite server, Hannah. She is so efficient and always remembers us and our order. She is dedicated, conscientious, efficient and personable. She is definitely an asset to Next Door."}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend at noon on a Saturday, and had plenty of seating options.  We ordered the black and blue burger (me) and the honey brie burger (my friend), and both were absolutely delicious.  The black and blue was easily the best I've had in Madison, with crispy, thick bacon, tangy bleu crumbles, and enough dressing to bring flavor without being overwhelming. The burger was perfectly cooked (I asked for medium-rare) and was just the right kind of juicy.  The frites were hot and crisp and well seasoned.  Next time I'll try the honey brie burger myself, but we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We haven't even left the restaurant yet and I feel the need to warn people from coming here. I had to order another mediocre beer to help choke down the garage that was served to me. What a shame. Atwood deserves better."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER THE CHEESE CURDS. Seriously, worst cheese curds in Madison. They had too much bland, cake-y batter that overpowered the very mild curds, which I think were inside the batter, but they were so melted it was just goo (Not enough cheese in the cheese curd - how is that even possible?) Even the side sauce was disappointing - watery and bland.   I really wanted to like this place - big tables, large selection of homebrewed beer, photos of the Atwood neighborhood around town. Atmosphere is nice, sadly the food is meh. I had the salmon sandwich, which was more like a mayonnaise-y salmon salad. It was alright after adding some salt.   The beer is the highlight of this place, lots of selection and they offer beer flights for tasting and figuring out your favorites."}
{"text":"Good beer, good food, good service, good value. Very pleased with my meals, as I sampled a bit of many things. I'm a fan & I give 3 stars now, since I'm confident a few adjustments will put Next Door in the 4 to 5 star range. The fries weren't burnt, but they had that burnt flavor, like something was overcooked in the frying oil before. My MAIN COMPLAINT IS the LIGHTING! WHOA DUDE!!! Target called. They want their lighting back!!! A dimmer will do wonders for ambiance & mood. Next Door needn't be a dark, unwelcoming cave, but it doesn't need to be as bright as a mall jewelry store! I promise I'll be a frequent customer if the lights dim a bit. Seriously...  In other neighborhood eatery news... Hopefully Stalzy's will adjust prices a bit? Even though they have a friendly alliance with Next Door, if I have $10 in my pocket, I know I'll get a helluva lot more for my buck at Next Door. A delicious, well made burger with fries (not a la carte) vs an ehhh-made sammich, with salt, grease, a soggy pickle, & no change for a side? I think Next Door is a no-brainer."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late noon lunch.   Ordered the Ssam Pork sandwich.   It came with french fries that where Great.   the sandwiches roasted pork was tender and tasty.  But the kinchi sauce was a bit mild for me.   Get extra napkins for this juicy sandwich.   We will be going back to try the custom brews and more menu selections.   The manager even stopped by our table to make sure we where happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"Good:  Decent beer (Sevex was really good the Wilbur was mediocre) and better than average food (I shared the poutine and had the Sassy Chicken Sandwich).  The Servers were friendly.  Bad:  You feel like you are in a repainted VFW hall.  The ceilings are concrete, so it sounds like everyone is yelling next to you.  The service was really slow.  2 hours for apps and dinner was more than I expected.  Entrees took ~40 minutes to come out on a Wednesday when the place was mostly empty."}
{"text":"Had a nice meal at Next Door the other night. This was my second time there, my first time was just for a beer shortly after they opened so I wanted to get back in and check it out.   It seemed less industrial and more 'moved-in' which was nice. The space is very cool and unique.   Their food menu was exciting, lots of options that I wanted to try. I had a pulled pork sandwich with kimchee, it was good but would have liked more spice. A friend had the beer mac and cheese, I tried it and it was delicious.   I'll be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I was illegally charged due to staff misusing my credit card that was just holding open a tab at the bar. Instead of swiping the card that was later handed to them at the end of the meal (my friend graciously paid the bill) they took her card but inappropriately charged mine and had her sign off on it as they returned her card with the receipt. At this time I already had my card in my possession so it was never assumed it was charged. When I called to get the charge removed, I was basically told it was my fault that they had mixed up the cards and that I needed to find someone to take the bill before they removed the illegal charge. I continued to say I never signed any receipt or authorized my card to be charged and they continued to accuse ME of fault. I finally had to report it to my credit card company because they continued to try to find someone to pay for the costs rather than just listening to a customer and reimbursing me. The management was belittling and would not assume any fault in the matter so rather than trying to be nice and have them figure it out, I should have immediately called my credit card company to take care of it as they were gracious and quickly removed the charge. I will never return due to this horrific customer service."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this a 2 instead of a 1 is because they just opened and the beer was tasty. But I found the atmosphere uncomfortable and lacking of any kind of  ambiance what so ever. The lighting is terrible, it very loud, and the seating is awkward.  The wait staff on both occasions took a long time to take our order and forgot the waters. I had a darker beer that was great the first time and an IPA I also enjoyed the second time. The first time I ordered the vegetarian tostadas and they were tolerable. Overly crunchy and fell apart and had an odd sweet taste to them. The second time my friend and I shared the crisps and cheese curds. The crisps were good but the  cheese curds were GROSS and definitely not vegetarian since I could taste that they had been dipped in the same batter as the fish. The were huge about the size of my fist and coated in the most disgusting fishy batter you could ever possibly imagine. I love cheese curds but these actually ruined curds for me, the word curd even turn my stomach now.  I really wanted to like this place as I work in the neighborhood and meet friends out for a beer and bite after work regularly.  There are a lot of good restaurants and brew pubs in this town, this one is not even close to par with any of the rest yet.  Chances are slim I will go back. If you eat meat and don't mind the uncomfortable atmosphere then you might love it though."}
{"text":"Great beer, lightning fast service, and great appetizers. I haven't tried any entrees yet, but if they are as good as the appetizers, then this place really has something going for it. Most reviews on here seem to complain about the \"busy-ness\" and service. This place just opened...give them time. As I said earlier, the service I got last night...which was busy...was great.   Oh...and the guy that talks about how he didn't like the pate obviously has no idea what pate is. Country pate always has a layer of fat on top. Other types of pates do too. The fat on mine was not thick at all, and in no way off-putting. The pate is delicious, simply put.  My only complaint is that the place is really loud. However, we talked to the owner and he says they are working on that. Again...this place just opened. Give them time."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Mad-town brew crawl. It has a nice large space to handle bigger groups. About 10 beers on tap. Ok amount of TVs for games and such. It's not a tour type of place; just a sit down and drink kinda place.  The waitstaff seemed irritated that we walked in and sat down (group of 7). We didn't see a \"see hostess\" sign and sat away from other groups of people. On top of that, she was slow and brisk."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm! We enjoyed the Cobb salad and fish tacos. The tacos had a huge chunk of cod right smack in the middle of each corn tortilla. Delicious. The Cobb salad was just the right amount of greens, cheese and turkey. Both combined perfectly with the brews, which to our surprise, completely hit the mark. You can order a house flight, which includes all brews on tap, for $20. A nice deal!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Next Door Brewing is a solid craft beer bar in the Madison area. I cannot comment on the food but there were many people enjoying a brew and some food while we were there.   I felt very welcomed when I arrived and loved that the bar area was separate from the dining area where many  families were enjoying a meal. It's family friendly in that respect but I never felt it was too kid friendly.   You can purchase flights or pints and they have a pretty extensive beer list. I tried the Belgium IPA which is was delightfully yeasty and light.   They also sell growelers and bottle their own beer.   I would have loved to spend, ore time here and there food but I guess that means I will have to come back."}
{"text":"I've been to Next Door 3? times now and I figured it was time for a review.    The first time I was here, the hubs and I were with another couple (Chicago Yelpers, actually) for lunch and most recently we went with the in-laws, also for lunch.  The beer selection isn't my favorite, mostly because I'm a wheat beer drinker, but this last time I tried a saison and actually liked it!  Thanks to our server whose name I don't remember for being helpful and assisting with a good beer choice!  I have tried the cheese curds (duh), pork belly sliders, feijoada, arancini, and beet salad now with varying opinions on each of them.  The first time I had the cheese curds, I thought they were good, but a little greasy.  Over time I kept trying cheese curds at other places that made me forget about Next Doors and keep moving it further down my ranking list.  But the most recent time the cheese curds were awesome and promptly caused me to pull out my phone and put it back in third place.  I REALLY appreciate the sauce that is served and the fact that it isn't ranch.  It's one of my favorite sauces for cheese curds in Madison.  I'm also going to timidly put it out there that I don't really like the pork belly sliders that I had the first time I was there.  I thought they were just fatty, and not flavorful, and I think I only ate half of them.  If I were you, I would order the feijoada instead because that was tasty.  And you know what else was tasty?  The beet salad of all things!  I don't like beets.  I think they taste like dirt.  I really WANT to like beets, but I just don't.  I think beets belong with Pinot Noir in the \"weird things that people consume that just taste like mud\" category.  But THIS beet salad I liked.  I still don't LOVE beets, yet.  But I ate two of them and didn't hate it, so for me that's a huge plus!  Nicely done, cooked properly, and the dirt flavor delightfully absent.    The atmosphere of Next Door is great, I have always felt comfortable there, the prices are good, and the cheese curds are great.  If you show up enough for the servers and/or owners to know you, that makes it even better!  I will definitely recommend this as a great bar with food to anyone who asks."}
{"text":"Crazy good cheese curds! Their frites were ok, but their malt vinegar ketchup was very good!"}
{"text":"I've been disappointed by this place on several occasions. The food is sometimes okay, but the staff has always been rude since the day they opened. I felt like a burden the second I walked in the door, and the bearded bartender is one of the rudest people I've come across in the service industry. My advice: turn around and walk out."}
{"text":"Definitely underrated Yelp! Beer was great. Food was great and affordable. Great, local craft brewer with a great space and unique, affordable food. What more do the Yelpers want?"}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to swing through this new brewery over the weekend. I am happy to report that the service was friendly and prompt, their beer was complex and delicious, the ambiance was very laid back and fun and they were playing great music. We only glanced at the food menu, but will definitely be back again to eat and try new beers. Their goal is to have a total of 11 taps, with about 3 being standards and 8 consistently rotating new brews and flavors. They also had 3 guest beers on tap. Great brewery, go check it out!"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: neighborhood brewery and gathering place.  Next Door Brewing Company is a large place but is still inviting. We sat near the bar and brewing equipment and ordered Cheese Curds ($7.50) and Short Rib Croquettes ($7), along with trying 4 different beers ($10 flight). While I wasn't crazy about any of their beers, the curds and croquettes were good. It looked like Next Door puts on a ton of events to get the locals in the door, and I think they're doing a good job with that."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly neighborhood establishment. Good burgers and cheese curds and they have freshly made pork rinds!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in at Next Door on a Friday evening around 8 to meet up with some friends for a few beers and some munchies. I had initially talked to the host when I walked in, thinking that maybe I would get a table for my friends and I (I was early). He said there might be a 20 minute wait, so I gave him my name and headed over to the bar. Inside ten minutes he came over to offer a table, but I had found some seats by the window overlooking the brewing room with the vats and color-changing lights (trippy!), so I was OK for the moment. He even came back a few minutes later just to make sure my friends and I were comfortable with where we were at. So basically their host kicks butt.   The beer (I believe all of which are House of Brews creations) was pretty great. I tried their Doe Eyed Brown, which had caramel notes on the finish with a nice mouth-feel (aka tasty). Then it was on to the S.S. Badger, their steam ale, which was crisp and tasty (think Anchor Steam). I also had their Egg Nog Sweet Stout, which I was initially apprehensive about, thinking it might have an overly-sweet vanilla thing going on - but no! Creamy, coffee-ish, with a hint of vanilla, and with fresh nutmeg grated on top, this beer was the highlight of our evening.   The snacks were de.light.ful. We had the eggs two ways (deviled and pickled with juice, both delicious), the sauerkraut sausage balls (which has a crispy exterior and a remoulade dipping sauce and were savory and great), and the poutine (made with thick-cut fries, a peppery gravy, Sassy Cow creamery cheese curds, topped with slices of green onion...I was in my own fatty paradise).   All of the three-star review people should give this place another go-round - I think their game has been stepped up."}
{"text":"The beer is okay and the whole concept is perfect, but the food is a joke if you get anything other than a burger or chicken sandwich. It seemed prepared okay, and the ingredients were high (enough) quality, but the menu (and recipes) should be replaced. A place that could be this cool should invest in a real chef, and it's a shame they haven't already. If they don't put some brains behind the menu they would probably be better off only offering cheese curds and burgers.  Mac and Cheese was bland and the fish sandwich is a mix of things that don't belong together.  With that being said, it's the perfect kind of place for the location. Right now it's just a cool neighborhood gathering place with bad food and mediocre beer."}
{"text":"Great upscale pub food!  It had been almost a year since the last time i came to Next Door for brunch. WOW things have changed. We truly had a great experience here on Sunday for brunch. I enjoyed the grilled cheese sandwich and chili, my boyfriend had the Mr.Rogers bloody and breakfast hash poutine and our friend had the grilled cheese Benedict. We all loved our meals. I did hope to eat a salad, but they did not have that on the menu. So come with your brunch pants on, they serve serious brunch at Next Door. My grilled cheese was so good that i had absolutely no regrets! Also, i would recommend sharing the beer pie. It reminds me somewhat of peanut butter pie but not as sweet. It was different, and i enjoyed it! They even put a little powdered sugar Next Door logo on the pie before serving. Get it!"}
{"text":"This was some of the worst, most over-priced bar food I've ever been subjected to.   The salmon croquettes were 9.50. What came to us were two, fishy smelling hockey pucks. My fries were fine. My chicken sandwich was something a toddler would enjoy. Not a veggie in sight and no flavors present except salty and cheesey.   The hugest failure was the fish taco special. It was 9.50. What came out of the kitchen was the saddest, smallest little plate of two tacos with no garnishes or sides. The fish tasted like it had been sitting in a steam tray for hours and the black beans below managed to be over-spiced and flavorless at the same time. We actually sent this back to the kitchen, and they get a star back for taking it off our bill.   I notice that people have really different experiences here. Maybe the back up chef isn't good?   We will not be headed back to eat here again."}
{"text":"Went to this place recently for some food and drink and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. I ordered chicken wings with a side of blue cheese, plus we have some appetizers to start. The food was really good, quality ingredients and lots of flavor. Ordered the curds and the poutine. Both were good, but putting beef brisket on poutine is a little much since it's already in a beef gravy. While the food was very good, the meal was overshadowed by the service. I've never been to a place where the sever doesn't write your order down, and thinks he knows it all, and then has to come back over to the table and ask what what we ordered. That happened with our beer orders and our food orders. The server messed up with the poutine and brought regular instead of vegetarian, and then was put out when we brought it up. The server perked up a bit once he came back to earth and realized he was paying his rent off of our tips....good grief. Nothing like solid beer, solid food from a really good kitchen, and bad service from the lowest part of the spectrum of the culinary world. I wish Madison restaurants would invest in robots for food service. I would feel much better about leaving 20% tips..."}
{"text":"This is LITERALLY my favorite place in Madison. They have great beer, great staff, and all the food is delicious.   The beer is outstanding. They have a rotating variety of styles and they work with local non-profits to make beers that support causes. You can fill a growler here affordably and they have good specials.   Trivia on Wednesdays at 7:30 is a fun time. Good fish fry. Great brunch."}
{"text":"A work in progress but definitely worth a visit. I had stopped by alone one afternoon and chatted with the owner. I was so impressed with his dedication to making his customers happy. Though it is hard to hear folks complaints he takes them to heart and does something about it. No arrogance just a commitment to excellence.  I returned the Wednesday before Thanksgiving about 5 pm. We had no trouble finding a table but the place filled up quickly after our arrival. There were 5 of us and i had no trouble hearing over the din. The waitstaff was helpful and attentive.   We started with the Crisps (strips of yam) which were crunchy and delicious. I especially liked the herby chimmichuri sauce that accompanied the potatoes. I tasted bot the White Onion Soup and the Butternut Squash soup. The squash soup was the clear winner for me. I thought the onion soup was too cheesy (I am not a WI native) and lacked umami. The squash soup was sweet and delicate. Yum.  My sister and her husband stated that the salmon sandwich was good, not great. They are gourmands of sort so they may be mighty picky.  I am not one to review beer. I like it but just do not know enough to rate it. The Wilbur was good but my brother-in-law preferred the Willy. That's all I know.  I live close by and am sure to return. I want to try their salads and some other beers. My son did have an Old Fashioned and he liked it just fine. I enjoyed the neighborhood ambiance and the attitude of the the staff.   I hope to add an extra star in the near future. Check back soon for an update."}
{"text":"Both the food and beer was awesome!  We got a sampler of all their beers, and they were all very good!  I especially liked the interesting floral notes in the aroma and flavor of their saison.  We had a variety of food (poutine, burgers, fried fish) and everything was well made and tasty.  I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"I'm walked in knowing what I wanted...a few beers and some food. Found a seat at the bar and slid right in. Grabbed a menu and got to deciding.  Beer: Sevex, Busy Bee Ale (my favorite), and Bray Road Beast  Food: chicken sandwich and some of the best fries I've ever had  While beer and food was good, I was a little disappointed the bartender kept changing channels. But really when none of your teams are on, does it really matter?"}
{"text":"If I would rate the place on the beer, I would give it more stars. I met a couple friends here after work for a couple beers and some food. We decided to order a few things and share them. I decided the Veggie Tostada sounded fabulous. It came out, looked great - tasted HORRIBLE, I even tried a few bites hoping that it would get better, it didn't. It was so incredibly tasteless. We also ordered a small mac and cheese, which it was good if you took a bite with the crumbly bread/cheese topping, otherwise it also lacked flavor and the noodles were overcooked. The frites were the best thing that we ordered, the basil aioli dipping sauce was awesome. Just quite disappointed in their food, its a fun place with a great atmosphere and good beer - hope they will step it up with their food!"}
{"text":"Quoted from my daughter: \" This place gets 2000 thumbs up\" If that is not a compliment, I don't know what is.  All three generations of my family LOVED their  experience at Next Door Brewing Company.   We ordered an Atwood Burger, Yahara Burger and the Sassy Bird Sandwich.  All came with the most delicious french fries.  I have no picture of them because they were all eaten and devoured so quickly.  My father ate his entire plate of food so quickly and washed it down with a nutty brown beer, I haven't seen him eat that quickly in ages.  My daughter loved her Yahara burger with the Challah bun.  My sassy bird chicken sandwich was perfect, moist chicken, perfect bun and yes, those darn french fries again. Before leaving my quotable daughter mentioned to the waiter she would like to come back every day.  So all in all here's what you need to know.   Delicious food and beer.  Great space for groups at the larger tables or there are some smaller table groupings.  In the bloody freezing weather of Wisconsin, this place was warm and toasty.  Children will be happy campers although they did not have a kids menu. See you again Next Door!"}
{"text":"So on an unexpecting Friday night bar hopping expedition, our final stop was Next Door Brewing. I've been wanting to try Next Door since before I actually moved here, so I was excited we were stopping here for our last drink.   Now coming from what is voted as Beer City ( Grand Rapids ) I have a love for brewing companies.. I don't think that there is one that I wouldn't like.  I'm happy that I can now check Next Door Brewing off the \"Brewing Companies to go to in Madison\" list.   I liked how open it is here, and the huge tables are very ideal for bigger parties I would imagine. The beer list looked fantastic, as well as the menu. We ended up getting the Cheese Curds and the Chips and Guac, both great.. the sauce that comes with the cheese curds is fantastic! And the service was pretty good as well. I will say that the interior is a bit blah and basic I guess. Nothing really stood out for me. But I will definitely be back in and drink up some amazing brews!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great beer selections and very helpful bartenders! I definitely recommend the mac and cheese with their mild buffalo!! Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Next Door after a 45 mile bike ride. I wasn't too sure, but I was hungry and desperate for a beer, so I took a chance. I'm so glad I did. The atmosphere is casual, the beer is outstanding, and the ribs were delicious. I even loved the coleslaw, and I hate coleslaw. Pepper, one of the owners, was tending bar. He was friendly, conversational, and helpful. He would give you recommendations for what to try and even let you sample different beers. I thoroughly enjoyed my time here and more than got my monies worth. Can't wait to be in Madison again so I can come back."}
{"text":"Ribs, cheese curds, blackened chicken, stew, fries, yam chips and a grilled cheese.  Flavorful, well done entrees. Not one item was a disappointment. Four very satisfied customers. I would recommend to a friend and hope to dine again. Glad we stopped in.  Service was friendly as well."}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favorite places in the Atwood-Schenck neighborhood.    Sevex is delicious, and they've run out a couple times- try it if you're there and it's available. My first visit I tried a flight of four beers and Wilbur and Sevex stood out . They come out with seasonal beers regularly and aren't afraid to experiment. If you're coming with a group that includes patrons not so keen on beer, don't worry - there's a long enough wine list and cocktail menu to keep everyone happy.  Anytime I've come to NDB, one of the founder is behind the bar, and more than happy to chat with you about NDB's origins, the ideas behind the beers, and their excitement about upcoming additions. Their passion is palpable without being intimidating if you don't know the difference between malt and hops (they'll happily give you a mini-lecture if it's not too busy). The wait staff is very friendly, and can answer any questions you have about the menu, which brings me to my next point.  Most breweries skimp on food. You get beer, and then some peanuts/pretzels/chips, with a burger or sandwich option if you're lucky. Not so with NDB. The menu is updated regularly, but I've tried the pickle jar, fish fritters, mix-and-match skewers, and veggie tostada. The pickles have good variety (I'm a pickle fanatic, so I was very pleased). The fish fritters are crispy and crunchy on the outside, hot and tender on the inside - a good option for comfort food on a Friday or any colder night. The skewers have some fun variety (chicken hearts anyone?) We tried all three options and enjoyed, though the hearts were a tad dry. The sausage was juicy and succulent. The mushrooms are a nice light contrast.  The space has a decent amount of chairs at the bar, standing room, and tables table/booths similar to something you might see in a tapas bar (as in, you might end up sharing a table with some other people), all in a warm wood. The ceiling is a little lower than most bars and gives the impression that you're in your childhood friend's rec room in the basement. Plenty of TVs for sports games, but they cover them when there's nothing on. I appreciate this because there's no conversation killer like a TV show with no sound.  I've had a couple friends visit from Milwaukee and always take them here. They always want to go back on their next visit to Madison. This is a great addition to the co"}
{"text":"Well I have been here twice now.  I think I can accurately review Next Door.  So the beer is good and stuff.  But the food is whatever.   Its just okay-nothing special.  I really must comment on the service at this place.  The service is not so good.  Incredibly slow. Even when there is no one in the damn place.  My friend asked for water and no water!  They brought mine, but not hers.  And the weirdest thing happened...our waiter asked to borrow one of our cheese curds so the people next to us could try them.  And just grabbed it right off our plate.  Not even kidding.  I am not sure this place will thrive much longer.  At least they got rid of most of their community tables so you arent forced to sit right next to some random stranger."}
{"text":"Great place! Been here before for drinks only, and never ate. Tried their brunch this time and was very impressed! I'm the MOH for an upcoming wedding and the couple is having their rehearsal dinner here.  It wasn't busy and we sat where we wanted. Nice open space with a dining area and a bar area. The waiter we had was extremely friendly and helped with some recommendations when I asked because everything on the menu sounded great. We started with mimosas and they gave us the small champagne bottles with the leftover champagne to drink. I ordered the pork belly eggs Benedict and it was awesome. I'm a huge fan of eggs Benedict but I get weary with pork belly because I don't always like the texture of it with it's high fat content. BUT this dish was great. The pork belly was cooked perfectly, wasn't chewy, and went great with the dish. The hollandaise sauce here is amazing. It was served with a side of mixed potatoes which was really good, it had a perfect balance of starch with different potato flavors including regular, sweet, and those purple ones. Great breakfast, will obviously be back. Can't wait to try some of the entrees for the rehearsal dinner."}
{"text":"Great beer and atmosphere! We loved the bubbler and kaleidospoke pale ale. Cheers mates!"}
{"text":"A lot of hoppy beers, I opted for the Sevex! It was a surprisingly drinkable beer. Mmmmmnnnnn, hand battered beer batter cheese curds. Arrrrlllllloooww (make this sound in your best Homer Simpson voice."}
{"text":"Went here for a beer on a Saturday afternoon and think this place is pretty cool. Super close to where we live and the beers weren't bad. They could use a couple more lighter style beers to satisfy those of us who don't like heavy IPAs. I definitely want to come back and try the menu"}
{"text":"Cheese curds best I have had. Frites perfectly crisp dipping sauces great. Luminous IPA very good Dart Porter also good."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review, my wife and I have been enjoying Next Door Brewing Company for a couple years now, visiting 1 or 2 times a month for appetizers  and beer.  Good food and some of my favorite beer in town.  Long story short, I broke my Next Door brewing growler a few weeks ago while washing it. I decided to purchase a Stanley stainless steel growler in its place. Took it to get filled today, was told by the bartender that he would fill it today but not again as it doesn't have an ounce label. It is stamped 2qt on the bottom, same size as a regular growler. Pointed this out and was then told no fill line on the canister.  This is absolute nuts, 64 oz container, buying 64 oz of beer no matter what the vessel is..other breweries fill it with no problems. To spend $14 for a growler fill and have the brewery worry about a fill line on something legally labeled as a 64oz container is ridiculous.. How much beer is spilled or given out a samples every day?  This is after spending $60 on food and beer in the taproom.  I'm going down the street to One Barrel brewing to get beer from now on.  Many options in Madison."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved their beers! The people were all very friendly and made it an enjoyable experience.  Only down side was it is more of a sports bar in a restaurant feel rather than a brewery vibe."}
{"text":"I went to Next Door Brewing for an after work gathering.   Parking - skip the tiny parking lot. It's a mess trying to get in and out of it. There is plenty of street parking all around the area.  Atmosphere - it was ok. It's a big open space that feels kind of bland.   Beer - as it's a microbrewery, I tried their sampler. It was also ok. I can't say I loved any of the beers nor were any of them horrific.  Food - it was ok. They have big, beautiful cheese curds but they aren't very flavorful. I also had their Atwood Burger which was, you guessed it, ok.  Service - was right in line with the rest of the experience. It was ok. It certainly wasn't terrible service but I wouldn't go out of my way to say it was good either.   I didn't find anything about my experience at all remarkable. If I have friends who want to go here, I won't object as it's not awful. But I would never suggest or recommend it. If I give it another try in the future and things are different, I'll definitely update this review."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. The food was outstanding, the service was quite friendly and very helpful. The stout made it in my top 5. The wood bar was very nice, which added to the overall homey feel to the place. Next door indeed. You can also see the entire brewing room, which was neat as they were working in their during my visit. My gf and I had a wonderful experience and definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Next Door Brewing Company is a solid 4 stars.  I've read some mixed reviews here and I can't comment on the food as I was only there for the beer.  But the beverages and service were outstanding.    My initial reaction when we entered was that the dining area itself seemed a little weird, maybe too crowded with tables and chairs.  That might be because everyone at the time we were there was sitting in the bar area.  But once we got situated, Next Door had a local neighborhood bar feel.    My friend and I walked right up to the bar and sat directly in front of the taps.  It was a glorious view.  There were 11 beers available in a variety of styles.  We went with a flight that included all the beers to share.  This included Bubbler (blonde ale), Kaleidospoke (APA), Luminous (IPA), Rockets Red, Darth Porter, Citravo (IPA), Strawberry Mango Saison, Hammerhead (Belgian IPA), Livacious (Saison), Egon's Revenge (gose) and Plumptuous (Scotch ale).  We took our time to enjoy all of these offerings.  Even the gose didn't bother me.  But I think my favorite was the Strawberry Mango Saison.  We got a little chatty with our bartender who liked that we were checking out local breweries.  He handed over his copy of Wisconsin's Best Beer Guide for me to leaf through and bragged that he's gotten his book signed by several local brewers when they've come to him at Next Door as opposed to him going to their breweries.  I agree, it's something to be proud of.    With another brewery to visit before dinner, we headed on our way.  But not before I decided to leave with one of the t-shirts that had just arrived for their 3 year anniversary party.  Yes, another t-shirt.  Don't judge me."}
{"text":"Solid beer.  Worst service ever!! Had to bus our own table. Servers were very rude.  They don't even have ranch dressing for chicken wings."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Next Door Brewing. My husband and I used to be regulars in their bar....we would love enjoying their small plates and trying a few beers. I'm not a big drinker so I really appreciate that they offer the 4 ounce pours. We hadn't been in, in a while - but we stopped this weekend for their brunch and it was amazing. I had their pork belly benedict and it was really, really good - the pork belly was cooked perfectly. Everyone I was with called their dish 'incredible'. The best part? They were pretty much dead, clearly under-recognized for their brunch at this point...so in a city where it's hard to find anywhere to eat if you get up after 8 a.m., it was really refreshing to be able to walk in on a Saturday and get amazing food quick. I will for sure be back for another brunch soon!"}
{"text":"This place has solid beer. The pale and IPA are both tasty. The food was very good. Burgers nicely cooked and the yuca chips were different and delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place. The beer, the food, the service, the prices, the ambiance.... everything. Great place. I have no more to say. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"So excited for a new place in my neighborhood!  It was pretty busy already beginning at 530 on a Friday.  As other reviewers said, it is very loud.  We just had a beer and some appetizers.  The food was good, especially the crisps with Chimchurri! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you appreciate quality beer and a cool place to hang out, this is your spot. The food options are great too, especially the beer Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, best cheese curds around, and the beer is unbelievable ! Never had a bad visit or experience when making a trip to next door! Also check out Monday specials and sundays they do some crazy crafty stuff in the kitchen !   Especially Minnesota traditions like Juicy Lucy's elevates :)"}
{"text":"Great beers and burgers! I will be back. Many unique options and decent selection of beers. In the far easy side, a little far out, but worth the drive from the west side."}
{"text":"It's not bad. Their beer doesn't make me do flips, the food doesn't make me do flips. The seating is weird - either packed into the bar or sharing a giant table with strangers - which is sometimes okay. Service - the last three times I've been there has been weak. I had a burger and a salad last visit. the salad was basically grass and leaves. \"Mixed Greens,\" I think it the technical term. I'm on a diet, so I just ate it, but it wasn't good.   Friends rave about the Poutine. I had some once. I'm not sure what it is, and didn't like it enough to look it up. Pass."}
{"text":"Being an almost strictly-wine drinker, I was surprised I liked several of the beers I tried (did the full tap sampler--11 beers).  One even tasted like wine!   I lucked out and showed up on the day of the Barleywine release!  Also tried the cheese curds--um, no.  Just no.  But $20 for the sampler flight was worth the visit.  I'll be back to try more whenever the rotation happens.  And oh, the descriptions were really accurate!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar with good beer.  We liked the fish fritters, pickled vegetables, Sasy Bird chicken sandwich and squash soup.  Nice dinner out for me and the wife."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times.  It's definitely a nice local place to hang out, drink some beer and nosh on some bar food.    Their brews are pretty good for local, though, admittedly, as much as I love beer I can't say anything overwhelmingly stood out.  I really enjoyed the hummus platter, but the second time I had it the tapenade was way too salty to eat.   I wish the food prices were more in line with a local pub versus a trendy gastropub.   It seems like they might be a little over priced for what you are served.    It's a good location with a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a flight of tasters. Sampled 5 in total, all of which were good. The best was Arch Nemesis. There was a smaller tasting room along with larger seating areas. I had some beer battered cheese curds which were just OK.   It's a short walk to One Barrel so hit both if you are out tasting."}
{"text":"Great food! Very unique and different! Bloody Mary's are great too! Lunch menu is small but has a lot of small plates!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to get an appitizer and a quick beer.  The bartendar suggested we try the cheese curds.  They were amazing!  I am glad we stopped.  All the beers I tasted were also excellent.   The place was clean and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I attempted to have dinner at Next Door last weekend and had a really disappointing experience.  We entered and saw the \"wait to be seated\" sign on the host station.  After waiting 5 minutes, and not seeing a server walk by, we decided to head to the bar, grab a drink and figure out where we could sit for dinner.  All the high top tables in the bar area had \"see server to be seated\" signs, but again, we could not locate a server. I made my way to the bar and said \"Excuse me\" twice to get the bartender's attention and ask the process to get seated for dinner. He looked directly at me, and then blatantly ignored me. Another patron noticed and tried to get the bartender's attention for me, and he still ignored both of us. So, without an option we left feeling quite baffled and got dinner elsewhere. Though we live in the neighborhood, with so many other restaurant options with at least okay service, I do not think we will be back."}
{"text":"Ventured out to the Atwood area for dinner during the annual Summerfest.  We knew the fun and festivities of the fest would probably mean a wait, but we decided to see what was happening.  Just a couple of blocks down from the closed streets, there were ample tables available at Next Door Brewing.  We started with the Eastside APA and Shack Farmhouse Ale.  The APA was exactly what I wanted on a warm sunny summer evening.  Light and crisp.  The Shack was not enjoyed as much as other saisons we've had this summer, but the bottom of the glass was reached. I then tried the WPA, but found the APA more to my liking.   Friendly and attentive wait staff. Not sure what happened to the other recent reviewer, but we got our waters quickly(both of us), and she was stopping by often to check on things. We ordered the burgers.  I went with the Wis-Cali, choice of beef over chicken.  Another fine burger for me.  The combo of the fried avocado with the jalapeno ranch was a fiesta in each bite.  And I love finding Knoche's beef on the eastside.  Keep it up!   She had the Yahara burger and it was done to perfection, but the sweet potato crisps were raved and raved about.  We'll be back as we are adding this to our return list.  I'll want to try more from the beer list, and also their appys and that sassy bird sandwich.  Great spot, although no cribbage board. :( We then returned to the Atwood Summerfest, ran into a couple of friends, and enjoyed some fun 70s music and the fine weather."}
{"text":"To start, i wont order food here again. It was overpriced and not amazing, actually my burger was the worst burger i have ever ordered anywhere but my bf's chicken sandwich was good, not worth the price, but at least good. Beer i was informed was good, but it took a long time to get my food and yeah, the burger with swiss and carmalized onions was a disgrace to burgers everywhere"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Madison, I often found myself venturing to the Atwood/Willy St. area for the atmosphere I desired and the food I craved. It wasn't long before I was hooked on the location, and I purchased a home here. To celebrate my buy I dined at Next Door, my first outing as a home owner in an area I loved, and it was a great choice.  On that particular night I had the Yahara Burger, which was stupendous. There was nothing extravagant about it, it was just a good ass burger. I also had the cheese curds, which WERE massive, and perfect, and left me craving them (like last night when I stumbled in), yet they are now teeny tiny little balls and that really makes me sad. The cheese curds are still great, I'd even go as far to say they are right up there with The Old Fashioned's, but they are just not as grand in appearance and the quantity is now a little off.   Everything else from my first visit, nearly a year ago to the day, and last nights has stayed the same. There is still great service, the dining area is large with plenty of seating, and the atmosphere is welcoming and fun."}
{"text":"All good beers! The tostadas were also amazing. I'd grill the salmon croquettes a bit longer though guys...just sayin"}
{"text":"I went to Next Door for the first time this past week, and I really liked it. Nice decor and even though I was with a large group, service was efficient and friendly. I didn't order any food but I tried someone's fried cheese curds (obviously no match for the reining champ on the square, but that's a pretty high bar).  They have a lot of good house brews - I really like stouts and their eggnog stout was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place falls under the category \"Want to like but disappointing.\" A local brew pub in the Atwood neighborhood is a great idea.  When i heard it was opening I was pumped! It's just unfortunate that the product is average tasting overpriced beer with similarly overpriced subpar food in an echoey cinderblock building with mediocre service.  I've had a few sandwiches on the menu. 1 is worth the double digit price.  The sassy bird is good but every other sandwich tastes like it's missing something. Their beer is OK. IF you were to find a beer you liked enough to buy a pitcher, you couldn't because you can only buy by the pint.  Service is spotty. Ive been here a few times and the service has varied.  One waiter was incredibly unhelpful. On another visit i asked if the red ale was hoppy the bartender replied \"No, it's very malty.\" It was hoppy as hell! I then asked the bartender if this was the correct beer because of said hoppyness. She replied, \"It takes hops to make beer of course it going to be hoppy.\" She lost my respect and 10% of the tip i was going to give.  I then politely asked for a water and flagged down a different bartender who pointed me towards the brown ale.   All in all I guess an average brewpub is better than a vacant lot. The bar still echoes like a vacant building though..."}
{"text":"Quaint little neighborhood brew house, the kind I wish I had near by. The bar area was small and packed when we arrived but there were two seats available and we nabbed them. An attractive young brunette, dressed to kill was tending bar and promptly took our drink order. Since we had just ate we just ordered a beer. I had \"The Shack,\" Saison and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not big on the style but since I would classify this one as atypical it hit the mark for me. Chamomile was largely present and offered just the right amount of uniqueness for my own tastes. The restaurant was largely dead at the 3-ish time of the day we attended and the bar tender was tasked with waiting on those tables as well. Since this was our 4th and last stop for the day I only tried the one beer but I intend to come back. Parking is very limited so imagine during their busy hours you'll need to park on the street and walk a bit. Next time I'll get a flight for a more appropriate review of their brews. I'd guess \"The Shack,\" a 4 out 5 on its merit alone."}
{"text":"Great beer. They would have received a 5 star however wait staff was less then friendly tonight. Normally we don't have that issue here."}
{"text":"I came to Next Door Brewing Company with high hopes-and left a little disappointed. They get four stars only because of the attentive, friendly waitstaff and the fact I really enjoyed their seasonal Holiday Beer (I forgot the name), the food deserved a 2.   Otherwise, the food was awful--maybe it was just an off day.  My son had their mac and cheese-and was disappointed. I had the sassy bird sandwich--the chicken breast was a little overdone and smothered in too much sauce.  Bun was so-so.  Cheese curds were passable."}
{"text":"Super excited to try this place! The decor was fantastic. They did a great job of mixing masculine and feminine, old and new. Easily a place to hunker down and stay a while. It took a while to get service, however, once we had, our server was attentive and polite. Being new to the place, my husband and I both ordered beer flights. (They are not listed on the menu, but they do have them.) It was basically pick 4, so between the two of us we sampled 8 of their brews. They were decent. Some had a strange after taste and some almost tasted like fruit infused beers. If this is your thing-drink up. I wasn't such a fan. I thought the flavors were strange-not bad- just different. The food was the same. I had the whitefish and potato cakes and my husband had pulled pork. Both dishes had strong middle eastern/ oriental flavors. They were also strange. It again almost seemed like a poor attempt at american/ middle eastern/ oriental fusion.   In short, if you are into middle eastern/ oriental flavors and fruit infused beers, this is your place. If you are looking to go a little more traditional, I would head some place else."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood brewery.  With many places popping up with new construction, I really enjoy the feel of this place having converted an old building and adding a ton of character.  The staff is great, I always feel welcomed and taken  care of.  The place can get busy, but I've never turned back.  Busy is good, in my opinion.  The food is fantastic, everything is always fresh and tasty, and sourced locally when possible...gotta respect that!  The beer is exceptional.  Brewer Keith can often be found performing \"quality control\" and is really good about discussing everything beer.  It's a nice touch for people who are curious about the process."}
{"text":"I'm giving  3 stars because  of the obnoxious group of people that were never hushed once while we tried to have a peaceful drink. Seriously,  these people  \"cheered\" for over an hour, they cheered and clapped and whistled everytime one of their friends walked in the room or stood up. The Badgers weren't  even playing.  Overall, the beer was good and our bartender was awesome."}
{"text":"Here for the Packers playoff game. Sweet potato fries & cheese curds are delicious. All tap beers are their own (duh). East side APA and the Batch 100 barley wine are my favorite. Caroline is killing it behind the bar. Her Moscow Mule is fantastic. Weird vibe from the host/server/cocktail waitress when we walked in, and the food menu other than bar apps doesn't interest me too much, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Let's review NDBC for what it is....a brewery with some really good food, but a limited menu.  First, the beer.  Come here once, come here often.  Next Door provides a good offering of beer, from hoppie to malty.  I absolutely love the Plumptous Scotch Ale...best non barrel aged Scotch Ale in Wisconsin.  They have IPAs, they have a porter and a stout and a lighter ale...a very complete beer menu.  The atmosphere is great.  TVs for sports, but music in the background.  Clean, modern look.  Food: I have not had a bad meal.  Fish Tacos are excellent.  Just tried the chili...if you like some spice it is excellent.  My carnivorous son had a burger and said it was excellent.  Service:  I always sit at the bar and both Brian and Erin do a great job at service.  Bottom line; this is my go to place.  Never a bad experience.  Sorry to see some of the poor reviews...I have never experienced any of those situations.  I recommend you try it...definitely for the beer...I have always enjoyed the food, and love the service."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit! We liked the batch 100 beer the most. We ordered the mussels and they were very tasty with generous portions. The service was great and the atmosphere was swanky but fun."}
{"text":"This place rocks, man. Listen -- when you're stuck living in Massachusetts, you pine for the funky joints back home with good beer, awesome bartenders, and food so tasty it gets taken for granted. That's this place. Fast forward to my airbnb host telling me I have to check this place out. She was so right. I sidled up to the bar and enjoyed the hell out of an impulsively ordered blackened chicken salad (fresh corn, spinach, avocados, beans, and chicken so tastily tender all piled into one of those tortilla shell salad bowl things.. perfectly accompanied by their chipotle ranch nectar of the gods) paired with a hard cider. Like freaking perfection. The dessert option was beer pie. What -- that doesn't cool? Dudes, it's a graham cracker and \"spent grain\" crust (it's a brewery!!), with a blonde ale custard topped with some kind of porter and chocolate ganache -- it is the coolest thing you've ever not tried yet. I don't need to recite their beer list, but any place with a göse AND a Berliner Weiße (no Waldmeister, but other options abound) is my new favorite tavern of choice."}
{"text":"Next Door's biggest issue is consistency. I feel like I am playing Russian roulette whenever I walk in the door. Do they have enough people on staff? Does the fryer have fresh oil?  I have been to Next Door many times at this point because it's better than Great Dane and the 2nd closest brew pub to my residence. At one point I was even the Duke (but no longer for reasons outlined below). I have had off the charts experiences at Next Door that made me reconsider rewriting my previous 4 star review as a 5 star review, and I have had OTHER experiences that made me wonder why I didn't give Next Door a 1 star.  The cheese curds at Next Door if you come on a good day are some of the best cheese curds you will find in Madison from the cheese to the breading to the chive dipping sauce. On other days the curds are crusty and blown out.  The service and staffing of Next Door appears to be the biggest issue here. Often it seems that the floor and kitchen are understaffed with long wait times for a table, ordering, and food coming out. It is apparent that the kitchen is understaffed on days when premade items like Brazilian stew remain delicious but sandwiches are bland or overcooked.  The servers don't always write everything down. On one visit we had a server return 3 times to tell us the beer we wanted was out and eventually returned to say the original beer we wanted was in.  Overall, go to Next Door if you can make it during a time that isn't a popular hour when the understaffed brew pub can actually handle the small load of customers. You will receive inventive pub food, quality beer, and all in a wink.  If you go during a popular hour, expect long wait times, poorly prepared food, and general frustration. Any cocktails you order will also suffer. On one visit our out of town friends received \"the worst Bloody Marys\" of their lives.  Next Door really needs to have more staff on the floor!  Writing this review saddens me because I really want to like Next Door. They have proven to me that they have a quality product worth raving about, but it has fallen flat too many times for me to be a repeat customer. I have felt embarrassed multiple times now when I have taken friends here after bragging about the quality of the cheese curds and other menu items. I will no longer be making that mistake.  Meh, you could do better going elsewhere in Madison."}
{"text":"First time eating here a week ago last Sunday.  My sweetie....uhhhh.....girlfriend....er....partner.....whatever she is....ordered the NDBC which she enjoyed...and I enjoyed the leftovers.  I ordered the pork belly benedict along with a 22 oz. threevex.  Let me just say right off the bat, have you ever had something that was sooo good you wanted to roll in it like a dog?!?  That's how this PBB was!  I'm not kidding.  The egg yolk oozed down onto the pork belly and uhhh ya....it was good.  Sorry....sorry....I'm in control now....it was good as was the beer."}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday for their new fish fry.   We both had the perch.   We both felt it was at best unremarkable.   The lake perch were small and overdone so there was no flakiness to them.   The fries were good.  The small slaw side was tasteless.   The Belgian IPA I tried was the best Next Door beer I've had here in a number of visits.   I'd rate it 5/10 on a scale of Belgian IPA's I've tried.   Overall an unexciting visit.   I would not earmark the place for any sort of visit.   I hope they succeed but they really need to get in touch with what people expect!    Madison has a great array of beckoning places...Next Door doesn't inspire return visits."}
{"text":"Visited Next Door brewing for the first time this weekend..Great all around experience. Beer was excellent. Food was great! The atmosphere and staff were all very welcoming. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh beer, with a good variety of styles, from black IPA to the tasty Wilber! cream ale. We tried two appetizers: The sausage and sauerkraut balls, and the poutine, both excellent pub fare. We'll be back for the burgers and pulled pork sandwich. Definitely worth a return visit. We were there on a week night, so it wasn't real crowded or loud. The place is attractive, with taupe walls, polished wood, and candles on the tables. We felt welcome and well cared for."}
{"text":"While my love affair with Madison breweries continues at Next Door, a different, sadder story happened with the macaroni and cheese.  The bartender was awesome. It helps that I came in around 1pm on a weekday, so I really had him all to myself to discuss Next Door brews, Madison in general, and entertain myself while I waited for One Barrel to open. He offered tastes of anything I wanted, handed over some cool stickers, and gave me a wooden token good for a free beer next time I'm there. Five stars and two eager thumbs up.  The beer was fantastic as well, I tried the Kaleidospoke pale ale (fitting as I had ridden my bike there) and the Luminous IPA. Both were excellent and did a good job of balancing the hop-forward flavors important to the style of beer with making sure that they are flavorful and not *just* hoppy.   I ordered the beet salad and the mac-and-cheese. The beet salad was fresh, well-presented, and I really liked the gorgonzola cream they made. It allowed me to add a little schmear to each and every bite, rather than crumbles which limit how many I have.  While the beets, beer, and bartender would keep me coming back again and again, the macaroni and cheese caused me to write a Facebook status claiming I will never order it at a restaurant again. It's just hard being so in love with it and having it end up disappointing each and every time. Here, the pasta was overcooked, the sauce was runny, and the breadcrumbs weren't quite golden brown and delicious. Also, I never know why people use a non-rigate pasta for a cream-based sauce.   Don't let the macaroni and cheese fool you, this is definitely a place to come to. Again and again."}
{"text":"Food is a nice little blend of comfort with an east side twist . Very solid fish fry. I was not digging the fries ... A little over fried..beer is truly the main reason to stop in .... Great selection."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I live close, I love the white bean burger patty option and the fried avocado Wisco-Cali sandwich. But the service is just...not...great. First visit the waitress was super charismatic but so inattentive none of my party was able to order a second drink, let alone dessert. We had to flag down another employee to ask for the check. Second visit I had to ask to be brought menus--waitress came to take our order and didn't seem to understand why none of us were ready. We had to order dessert at the same time as our entrees to avoid the same problem as last time. I'm not sure if they're understaffed or have poor training or what, but I hope they're able to improve their service."}
{"text":"After a very enjoyable Yelp tasting event at Next Door, I was excited to come back and brings my girlfriend and friends along.  Unfortunately, the food didn't even come close to measuring up to what I experienced before (with the exception of the cheese curds).  The cheese curds, amazing liquid orbs of muenster cheese with a light breading, have to be some of the best in Madison.  These alone are worth making the drive for.  So where did Next Door stumble?  First, they charge for samples (almost $2 for a small pour).  It's their prerogative to charge but when the waitress doesn't make mention of this, it is a shady oversight.  Quite honestly, why charge at all?  Are people really trying to take advantage and order 12 samples to avoid buying a beer?  For a small brewery trying to expand it's clientele, I think this is a huge mistake.  They should encourage their customers to try their beers and build up their fan base.  The second miss was their version of Banh Mi.  It is no secret that like Mikey in the old Life Cereal commercials, \"I will eat anything\" but the Banh Mi stopped me in my tracks.  Swapping out a chicken liver pate (vs a more traditional pork pate), the sandwich was a mushy mixture that had a taste that was reminiscent of the smell of cat food.  I took one bite and put it down.  I give credit to the waitress for noticing and asking if I wanted something else.  I don't give her credit for removing one sandwich charge only to replace it with my second order.  I thought this was bush league. Overall, a disappointing night.  With the amount of restaurant choices out there, I can't recommend Next Door due to their inconsistencies.  Why risk a crummy meal when there are so many other places that bring quality food and service day in and day out?"}
{"text":"I don't know. I wish everything about it was better. The vibe, the beer, the odd space. Everything."}
{"text":"The beer is awesome.  I tried everything that was available on tap that day and was not disappointed with any of them.  The food was some of the best brewery food my wife and I have had (we've been to a lot too).  A must try if you're in the Willy Street - Atwood area of Madison!"}
{"text":"I've only been once, but I would totally come back!  What I tried:  Honey Brie burger (with a white bean patty)- first of all, the veggie patty did not immediately fall apart. This is a mark of a good veggie burger. Very flavorful and the honey just pushed it over the top. Also, brie... sign me up.  Fries- exactly what fries should be. A non pushy complimenting partner to a more interesting burger.  Beer Pie- I did not like this at all. It was hard and soft, bland and too salty all at the same time. The layers did not marry very well together and so were divorced and you could taste the alimony and awkwardness. Not my jam. Had pass on this one.  Service was friendly and prompt and the bar is really cool looking. I don't like beer, but they have it. So, if you like it, that might appeal to you..."}
{"text":"Dude,  Communal dining? For real? Did I get zapped back to 2007? Communal dining would be a great idea, if everyone in the world weren't an asshole.  But that's not the staff's fault  Food - Good Beer - Really Good Service - Really Good  Bossman - Get some more two-tops in there and turn the lights down for chrissake."}
{"text":"Just popped into Next Door for lunch with a couple of friends after training that Twisted Fitness Gym just down the Road.   I had the hearty salad. It was a hit... Albeit I'm not sure how healthy it was with the warm bacon dressing and fried egg.   One companion had the Feijoarda a traditional Brazilian stew - it was fitting give we had just gotten of one with Brazilian Jiujitsu class. It looked good and said companion won the clean plate club. Other companion had the braised pork shank. He was excited to see it was bone in and reported it had a lot of good flavor.   Did mention the beer was great as well. Drink Local Beer and Eat in Local Restaurants. If been to Next Door when they first opened for dinner. I think I enjoy this place better as a lunch joint in terms of eating. It's a fine drinking joint anytime of the day."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from Next Door Brewery and its proximity is delightful! Some of their food has been a miss (mostly: the burger with the rye bun is tasteless, as is their Mac and cheese), but their short rib croquettes are a luxury for your tastebuds, as is the French Onion soup when it's on the menu! The yam crisps are a steal, both in quantity and taste, as far as pub fare goes!   As for beer, I love their ever-changing menu, but also knowing that my favorite option, the Eastside APA is almost always on tap!  Service has been great, although it can get busy during dinner.   This is a must-go brewery, don't give the negative reviews of Next Door too much hype because it's a fantastic place for a beer and a bite!"}
{"text":"Just tried Next Door Brewing Co.on a week night last week. The ambiance is great, hard wood floors, smaller but nice bar and a windowed off area where you can see the brewing equipment. Not sure if they are still figuring out staffing, but our service was incredibly slow. The staff was nice but we waited a long time to even have someone come over with waters and take our order. I had the white chicken chili which was on special that day and it was great! The portion size was huge, especially considering the low price I paid for it. Will definitely come back on a weekend and try some of their drinks."}
{"text":"Always a great time coming here! The staff knows their beer and there is a nice selection of food. And it's definitely not your typical pub food. Well thought out and unique menu items that are always delicious.  And of course the beer is good, a handful of staples year round and another handful that are always rotating. There is a beer for everyone's taste, and if there isn't one you like one month, I guarantee there will be the next month!"}
{"text":"Oh for sure! I was here tonight after work with friends - this is such a great place! Good beers (I really like kaleidospoke!) Good atmosphere, a great place to meet up with friends. I sooo recommend the cheese curds (possibly the best fried cheese curds I've ever had) and also the yam crisps! Is there a general limit on the use of exclamation points?? Great service, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, both food and beer is hit or miss, mostly meh.   We've had a few of the dark beers, they're ok but not among our favorites.   On the menu: Barleyfork burger has decent ingredients (beer cheese spread, fried jalapeño, drunken onions) but for $12 there is too little burger and it just doesn't come together well.  Beer mac - bland but otherwise ok Poutine - not good. They need to work on their gravy.  Service is good, servers are friendly."}
{"text":"PROS: Reasonable prices, fresh ingredients, ample seating CONS: Mediocre pub fare  Next Door serves standard bar food that satisfies one's hunger but not necessarily one's palate. Given a choice, I would take my comfort food cravings elsewhere."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon. There were two or three tables and a half dozen people at the bar. We were instructed to sit wherever we liked, so we sat down at one of three tables in the bar area. I saw at least two serves walking around and one bartender. We checked out the beer menu, made our selections, and then waited. And waited. We sat there for five minutes and no one came to take our order, say hello, or offer us food menus. In the end we decided to walk a few blocks to the Harmony where the bartender doesn't pretend you're invisible.  I can be patient when it's busy and servers obviously have a lot on their plate. But this was not the case on Sunday afternoon. I'm disappointed because I was really excited about a brew pub opening up in our neighborhood. I'll give them another shot in a month or so. Hope they work out their staff issues by then."}
{"text":"Stood in the front entryway for about 8 minutes waiting for someone to greet me and no one did. I ended up calling (twice, as the first time no one answered the phone) to inquire about seating on the patio outside. I don't know, it didn't seem that busy, and there were 2 bartenders behind the bar. I've come to the hard realization that Madison just doesn't value customer service or maybe NDBC just is too cool for school.   Would have liked to trade them money for beer - but maybe they have enough money."}
{"text":"The beer is very good, with more to be tapped soon, and the food is much better than I imagined.  My favorites are the sausage balls and sweet potato crisps, both appetizers.  A pint of Sevex or WPA and those two is a perfect late afternoon happy hour meal.  I highly recommend Next Door and cannot wait to try their Sweet Wheat and IPA once they've been tapped.  There were definitely some opening day/weekend hiccups, as Bobb S. mentioned, but as far as I can tell, things are much improved a week later.  The service is much better and the food has improved as well.  They may have only been open a week, but Next Door is already my favorite place in the Atwood corridor!"}
{"text":"Really great food. Interesting menu without being too eclectic. Nice relaxed atmosphere but definitely has character. Good service. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in on opening Saturday of MCBW for lunch and beerfecta. We were also looking forward to trying the Mutha Pucka. It was not very sour for a sour. When you are looking forward to a sour, that's not good.   We had looked at the food menu online before going and were pretty optimistic. When we got there we soon discovered they only offer the brunch menu for lunch on weekends. I was fine with that, but hubby isn't big on breakfast. I ordered poutine hash and hubby went with huevos rancheros. Mine was a bit too salty and his was cold.   We will stop in again for a flight. Not sure about food. Definitely worth stopping to complete the beerfecta."}
{"text":"Great menu, featuring healthy and unique twists on favorite items. Our party enjoyed Beer Macaroni and Cheese and Vegetable Tostadas with Yam chips (a twist on sweet potato crisps, it seemed). The beer selection was excellent (including three in-house IPAs). It seems that a lot of items are made fresh day of, as they were out of a few items by the time we got there late on a Friday. I take this solely as a compliment to their freshness, though."}
{"text":"I've visited Next Door Brewing Co twice now, both times for lunch since it's closet to my office.  Our waitress on our first visit seemed very disconnected with the menu / specials and service was not that great.  On the second visit we were well taken care of and the staff was very friendly.  Both times the food was great and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I love the Atwood neighborhood and I love supporting small businesses and brewers, but...meh. Gotta be honest, I'm unimpressed.  Let's start with the communication issues. A person in my group was told over the phone that in order to ensure six seats together for team trivia, we needed to arrive an hour in advance of trivia start time. As I live closest, I volunteered to arrive then, which I did. The greeting was friendly and the table and seats were provided, no problem.   45 minutes later, due to work and travel issues, my friends had yet to arrive. No problem for me, but this is when things started to go wrong. The hostess came over and coldly informed me that she would not continue to hold the seats near me because 'other people were waiting'. (Ummm....I looked around the very open space and did not see a single person waiting, and in fact there were other open seats remaining. There was actually no need to arrive a full hour early, either. The place didn't start to get at all busy until maybe 20 minutes before trivia started.)  I then spotted my friends outside, one of them finishing a conversation with someone, and I indicated this to the hostess. She completely ignored me as if I hadn't spoken, then seated a group at the other end of the communal table who used two of the seats I had been holding. When I protested this, she and the waitress brought over two chairs and slammed them down at the narrow end of the table next to me, and said we could all squeeze together. Unbelievably rude.  My friends came in, and I told them what had gone on, and one of them went to complain. We were then moved to the other large table behind us...which was empty. I hadn't noticed it, since my back was to it as I was watching for my friends through the front window. Why on earth the waitress and hostess didn't simply seat the other party there, I have no idea. My friend continued to discuss the matter with the waitress and hostess as they were seating us. We were told that the problem was that we were not given all the information when we called, because in order to hold space, \"you also need to have to entire party there by 15 minutes before start of trivia\". Then she snapped, \"there you go, everybody's happy now\".   I mean.  So, really rude customer service, mediocre food, and beer that has an odd metallic aftertaste (I sampled three). Kudos to my west side friends for making the journey to my 'hood, and I'm sorry the experience wasn't at all worth it. Get your stuff together, Next Door. You can do better than this."}
{"text":"I tried out the Next Door Brewing Company on a Friday, and I knew they recently opened so I was expecting a ton of people and slow service.   And that was what happened, but I was expecting that.  I had several of their beers and I thought they were pretty good.  I also had a pork and slaw sandwich which was very good.  Hopefully they can staff up for Thurs-Sat nights to keep things moving.  Also due to the stone walls, ceilings and floors it is very loud and had to hear."}
{"text":"I'm eager to return since I swung by for a happy hour with a friend.  We happily sampled their brews... I'll be back for that White IPA.   Food: The house corn dog gave me hope. The poutine did not. The mix & match skewers rocked. Highly recommend the mushrooms and the sausage, but wouldn't suggest the hearts unless you're obsessed with them in some way.   I fell in love with the setup table-wise. As a planner of meetings, I seriously dug the ginormous tables that could seat large groups. And the best part is they have more than one giant table. (Smart move Next Door, now I want to fill one of 'em!)  I'm looking forward to returning for a full meal and will update my review when I get the chance!"}
{"text":"Great east side bar-small time gastro pub. $5 for a growler to keep? Yes, please. The brunch bites are amazing. ..great chicken and waffles and vegan options are available."}
{"text":"Solid first attempt with enough excitement to return. While the food menu didn't make me jump up and down, I dug the atmosphere and the tap line. Next time I want to go past snacks and give the reg menu a whirl, then update. A super awesome addition to the hood though. Once I'm certain will continue to gain in popularity over time!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing a lot about the Madison craft beer scene and wanted to check out the local new breweries in the area. I came across Next Door because I wanted to grab dinner with a few friends.  The place is nice on the inside, able to accommodate larger groups.  The service was pretty quick and friendly. The beer is pretty tasty and would love to come back and try more.  The food was ok, nothing special but not horrible either. Cheese curds were kinda strange though and I wouldn't order those again.  The beers make me want to come back and give this place a second try, but if the food isn't better that may be my last time coming as there are lots of places with good food and good beer and in the Madison area you don't need to compromise."}
{"text":"There are many great places to get beer in Madison, and unfortunately Next Door just doesn't compare.  The space itself is huge and really nice. We came on Sunday afternoon, and other than a few people at the bar, the place was pretty empty. We grabbed a table and ordered a tasting flight of 8 samplers. The beers were all extremely carbonated. Most of them were overwhelmingly hoppy. I like hoppy beers, but these were hoppy in an unpleasant way. Beers such as the red ale, which you would expect to be malty, were hoppy and very bitter.   We also ordered the ribs and corndog to snack on. The ribs were terrible. They seemed like a pack of frozen ribs that had been boiled and then slathered in sauce and served to us. They were soggy and rubbery with an off-tasting very sweet sauce. The corndog was okay.  This does seem like it would be a great place to come watch a football game (they've got several TVs by the bar) or just hang out with a group of friends, but the food and beer did not impress me."}
{"text":"Had another great meal at Next Door today, they never fail to disappoint.  While there are more and more craft brewers around town offering great beers, none adds the high quality and unique foods of Next Door. And today we shared in a game of beer cribbage (their 11 beer flight).  If you're looking for good beer and good food, you won't find better. Trust me, I've tried."}
{"text":"By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had! Crispy with a melted inside that was fresh and phenomenal. Great flavor and epitome of a good cheesecurd! Corndog was delicious with fresh homemade breading with a wonderful sausage inside! Only complaint was how spicy our Mac n cheese was (made with cayenne pepper we were later informed!!) without any warning on the menu which could have been bad if it was a go-to for kids. Friendly service and to die for food, can't wait to bring friends back!"}
{"text":"Only things you need to know: great beer, great food, clean bathrooms, friendly people, and nice atmosphere. You like good beer... Go here!"}
{"text":"Next Door Brewing Company is a great neighborhood bar that has a tasty menu and fine beer options. They continue to update their beer menu, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a day when  you won't like their selection.  Family members came to visit us recently, and they were happy with the food and beer as well. The service was great also -- even though we came on a busy evening (Tuesday game night!), the staff seated us quick, got us drinks, and served us food in a timely fashion.   I always recommend Next Door to friends who ask to try something new, if they haven't already tried it themselves. Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Nice local place to hang out with friends. Food options were good. Pig skins and sweet potato crisps were both fresh and delicious. Basil aioli paired well with the chips and spicy dip was perfect with skins.   I have to rate you as ok for the beers. I tried the wheat and ipa. Just average- nothing special.    The space is nice with TVs and friendly staff.   Work a little harder on the beer quality. You've got a lot of competition out there."}
{"text":"I really enjoy how often they have new beers. It seems like every time I visit there is something new to try. They may not hit it out of the park every single time, but I appreciate their originality and willingness to try different things. Their Mutha Pucka pineapple sour ale is something fun and interesting that they've put out the past couple of springs. Also, and this may sound weird, I think they have awesome beer glasses, I actually own a couple! I've eaten here a few times as well and I've enjoyed the food every time. I have seen some comments about the food being inconsistent, so maybe I'm just lucky, but I've liked everything I've tried. It's a great place to hang out and have a unique beer or two (or three)."}
{"text":"I ended up here today completely by accident. I was on the way to The Alchemy for a quick lunch when we noticed the sign. After scrambling to figure out if it was open (thank you, Facebook), we decided to head back. We live in the Atwood area and had NO idea this place was coming, let alone already open! I drive or bike by here almost every day and hadn't even noticed the building was being developed into something new. Anyway, I am really excited about a brew pub within walking/biking range of my house, especially since it seems like it is going to be a good one.  My first impression was that it felt very comfortable. There was a lot of space in the dining room when we walked in and I really liked the more \"pub\" like feel of this as opposed to some other spots that are doing a very industrial warehouse look. I love that their televisions are enclosed in cabinets with a pulley system to hide them away. From what their website says, they will only have them on during special events and things like that which is nice. The last thing Madison needs is another sports bar. The bar area felt nice, too, though we didn't sit over there.  The menu was pretty interesting. Standard appetizer fare such as cheese curds and fries joined some funky items such as a gourmet corn dog, locally sourced veggie and meat skewers, and sauerkraut sausage balls. We opted for the cheese curds because even if you get bad fried cheese curds, you are still eating a pile of delicious cheese. Verdict? Above average. I felt like they had great flavor but a bit too much breading and my dining partner thought they were good and that the dipping sauce was great.   For our main courses we went for the Yahara Burger and the Salmon Sandwich. The burger was great - juicy, flavorful, and very fresh tasting. The challah bun from Staltzy's Deli was a great choice. The included fries were OUTSTANDING. They say on the menu that they are hand cut. I assume that means they hand cut them in the shop, and if so that is damn impressive. Fresh fries seem to always be kind of soggy and chewy, but these were crisp and cooked perfectly. I was told the Salmon was good as well and she also really liked the fries.   Now, onto the important stuff! Beer. We both enjoyed our drinks. I ordered the Les, a tasty and mild ale. Very drinkable. She ordered the Wilbur!, a delicious cream ale. It reminded me of a more flavorful Spotted Cow. We were both very happy with our drinks. I really hope that they avoid the trend of every beer being super hoppy, and from our first visit it seems like they just might.   Overall I am super pumped about this place and I think they have a real shot of doing well. A menu loaded with just enough standards to keep people comfortable, but some fun twists to get others excited. A nice atmosphere. Good beer. Great location.   Yep, it's a keeper."}
{"text":"We biked out here today for a Sunday adventure and had a great time! Luna, our server was fantastic! The Luminous IPA is delicious- although dangerous at 6.8%! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Four stars is a composite.  Here is a bit of a breakdown:   *  Wednesday trivia nights:  FIve stars.  With a group, it's a smash.  There are a couple dozen groups and all the tables are full, and the moderator is a gem, and the contest is an agonizing, elating, devastating, exciting way to spend a couple hours, drinking very good beer to boot.   *  The beer:  Four stars.  A nice palette of styles, from a a double IPA to a Berliner Weisse to a scotch ale that is more like a quadrupel.  That last one, the Plumptious, is my fave, and it's a rare treat, if you like quad and barleywine thingies - - this one with a light, zesty edge.   * The staff:  Five stars.   * The food:  Three or Four stars.  \"Spicy\" wings were way, way, way too boring sweet, though very substantial and meaty;  charcuterie plate was OK;  fries were OK;  the veggie tostada looks really good from a distance;  I had another meal one time recently, but I forget what it was, which tells you something."}
{"text":"This was the biggest disappointment. Came for the Pints for Pups event. We arrived at 12 to have an hour wait, okay we'll deal. Finally sit after drinking mediocre beer, which only two donated to the cause. Ordered off the brunch menu, with two apps. Cheese curds and fries. Have been waiting for another hour, only fries have come. Told us they are out of eggs, and may or may not get a discount. Not the point. I understand they are under staffed but why would they host such an event if they couldn't handle it. Our meals are currently being bright out one plate at a time. When my plate came, they suddenly found eggs and they were nasty. Order medium over and they were burnt and rubbery. Disgusting. Waste of my Sunday and money. Never doing this again."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I heard that we had a new brewery and restaurant in town, so I showed my wife the menu, and she got excited, too.  Unfortunately, our experience tonight did not live up to our hopes.  When we got there, no one was at the host station.  I flagged down a waiter, and he told me I should talk to the host, who was walking around somewhere.  The host came over, asked us how many we were, and sat us immediately after cleaning an open table.  We were very happy to be seated so quickly.  We got our menus, and ordered our first beers.  We'd been waiting for long enough at that point that we knew what we wanted for appetizers, so we ordered those, too.  We both also asked for glasses of water.  The beers came out a reasonable amount of time later.  We were both very impressed, and at that point we were convinced that we were in for a good experience.  I had the Sevex, which was pretty good, and my wife had the Wilbur, which we both liked a lot.  After about half an hour, our appetizers came out.  At this point, our waitress had not  checked on us once, and still had not taken our food order.  She set down our appetizers, took one of our food menus, and walked away before we could order our entrees.  We thought that was unusual.  For appetizers, we'd ordered the cheese curds and the pate.  The cheese curds were perfectly fine.  They weren't anywhere near the best I've had in town, but they were good--crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside.  The dipping sauce wasn't great, but the curds themselves were good.  The pate was strange.  Again, the pate itself was good, though my wife said she tasted an off metallic taste.  I didn't get that; I genuinely enjoyed it.  What I didn't enjoy, though, was that there was about a 1/4-inch-thick layer of semi-congealed fat on top of the pate itself.  I have no idea what it was, but it was gross.  It wasn't good, it wasn't rich, it wasn't warm, it was just as if someone had dumped fat on top of the pate.  It was unappetizing.  At this point, we still had not ordered food, though I'd had two beers, both of which were good.  Eventually, we did order food.  This was after nearly an hour in the place.  I ordered a standard burger, asking that they put cheese on top, and my wife ordered a chicken sandwich.  Both with fries.  I also ordered their onion soup.  Then we waited.  For about an hour.  And still did not have food.  Or water refills.  In fact, we didn't get silverware or napkins at any point during our meal.  What we did have was noise.  Lots of it.  The restaurant is larger than we expected, with concrete walls, and there were a lot of people, so it was just loud inside.  It was hard to hear each other from across the small table.  Several other groups were seated while we were waiting.  At some point, the waitress came over and apologized for the delay, and explained that the kitchen was swamped.  Honestly, that seemed plausible given how many people were in there.  But, eventually, my wife and I realized that no one was getting food.  Some people were getting appetizers, but no one was being served their entrees.    After what seemed like forever, we noticed that groups that had been seated after we'd put our food orders in got their entrees before we got ours.  That's when we really got frustrated.  A few minutes later, though, we finally got our food.  Except not really.  I had ordered the onion soup.  What I got was a bowl full of the gazpacho.  I explained this to our waitress, and she first insisted that that's what I had ordered, and then blamed it on the kitchen.  I told her I would skip the soup and she took it back.    My wife had ordered the chicken sandwich, which comes on a Stella's hot spicy cheese bread bun.  It was as advertised, except it wasn't very good.  My wife ate half of it out of grim determination, but couldn't get through it.  Her fries were cold.  Like, all the way cold.  My fires were hot, and they were delicious.  My burger was cooked perfectly, but it didn't have the cheese I'd asked for.  And it was just a bun with a patty on it; there wasn't anything else to it--not even condiments.  I took one bite, and it was just bland.  Not bad, just bland.  And I didn't get the soup I'd asked for, and my wife's food was terrible.  And my burger didn't have the cheese I'd asked for.   By this point, both my wife and I were done.  We'd been waiting for so long, and then our orders were wrong and the food we did get was mediocre overall.  I approached the host and explained the situation.  He apologized, and sent the waitress over, who offered to fix my burger.  Reluctantly, I let her take it.  While we were waiting, my wife and I considered our options, eventually deciding that we preferred to cut our losses on our food at Next Door and go to Five Guys instead.  So that's what we did--we paid our check and went and got Five Guys.  I want this place to succeed, but it just wasn't a good experience toni"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night.  We got an order of the Korean barbecue chicken wings (not at all crispy, and you had to fight with it to get a bite. I ate 1), poutine (bland), and the black and blue burger (overcooked).  The hubby woke up at 12:30, and was in the bathroom for the next 2 hours.  We will not be returning."}
