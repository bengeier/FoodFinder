{"text":"I'm addicted to the breakfast burritos here!!! Home made flavor at a great price. It's huge too!  Would recommend this place to anyone!   More than just a deli."}
{"text":"Food is OK but the new management team has no idea what they're doing. When I called to tell them my order was wrong the line was busy for 45 minutes. When I finally got through and told them I'd been trying to call the owner laughed and said \"oh yeah our phone was off the hook and we didn't realize.\" I asked for credit back on my card because the order was wrong and it took them a full day to figure out how to use their credit card system. One of their team members yelled at a coworker of mine when she asked for new menus, accusing us of hoarding them, apparently. Not worth the time of day."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and a very nice staff!  Always glad to support a local business, especially when they do such a great job!"}
{"text":"Great subs. Especially the turkey or the egg salad."}
{"text":"I'm getting addicted to this place. Sometimes the wait is long but, so worth it. For a breakfast burrito you'll want to share it. Eggs, potato, cheese, & your choice of meat for under $5.00!! For me, this is usually breakfast and lunch. Try it. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good for a small hole in the wall less crowded lunch. I go there about once a month as I work around the corner.  Their menu is a big chart which is a little confusing at first, but basically you find what you want at the left and work your way right to add more stuff to the sandwich. I usually get a turkey.  A word of caution, get the 6\" as they really fulfill their motto of full belly, the foot long is too much to eat. The bread is really good, so are the ingredients. I have not had anything here that did not taste fresh.  My biggest complaint, they use polystyrene cups."}
{"text":"Stop in here for the first time to try this place out. Friend of mine talked them up. This place is worth the drive for me. Got the cheese steak with jalape√±os. Best decision that I made to feed my stomach today. Tasty tasty tasty. Will be back again and try some of the other sandwiches that they have!"}
{"text":"Pristinely clean little place and really nice staff. I was offered a free drink, as I'd requested grilled buttered bread for my sandwich, and it would mean a tiny bit of a wait. The sandwich was really reasonably priced, and is probably the best BLT I ever ate. They use real bacon, not that thin stuff that barely tastes of anything, and the grilled buttered sourdough (which she suggested) was just plain AWESOME :-) I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Not the best. I wish I would have gone to port a sub like I had planned. I ordered the meatball sub with a side of coleslaw.  The meatballs tasted like they had been store bought and frozen for some time. The coleslaw had way too much mayonnaise.  Will not recommend."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week, great food, great new owners, and it is not processed food. Gets a bit crazy, but that happens when the food is good. Blt has $5 worth of bacon on it :) Potato salad is awesome, and everything is hand made. I like it."}
{"text":"This place had good food and is reasonably priced. It's been through several owners now and I think overall the food and atmosphere has improved. The reason I gave it only 3 stars is because they take forever preparing and getting your food to you. The person who works the register also brings you your food as well so there is a delay there. They really need to hire another person in the back to help make and bring the food out."}
{"text":"Absolute Joke!  The girl that took my order looked like she had been crying, didn't smile. Asked what kind of deli meat they used and she said quote: \"I don't know, why buy these big things, think its American Pride, huh, don't know\" Ok - that should have been a clue!  Got my son a turkey deli sandwich, order my-self a Mesquite Chicken deli sandwich. Order it to go and paid 28.00 for 2 sandwiches, chips and a drinks, ok.... Go over to get a drink and there's a huge sign that says refills are .50 cents, ok..... So they are cheap, another clue!  My son got his in 3 minutes of order and it was prepared to eat at the restaurant, told them the order was to go, she brings out his sandwich and goes to hand it to me, I told her there was another turkey sandwich, they got totally confused and I said, \"Oh I am sorry I got a mesquite chicken\" the owner says oh well it right here has working on it. OK no big deal. She walks over to her husband and starts talking crap about me, LOUD RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!!!!! You Moron!   10 minutes later I get my sandwich and my Mesquite Chicken deli sandwich is made of processed chicken fajita strips they probably bought at Walmart! WTH? Who ordered a fake chicken sandwich?   There's a reason no body was in there! I should have figured it out. I have more experience in my pinky finger in the restaurant industry then you folks will ever have in your life, just because youth a mediocre home cook, doesn't mean you should open a restaurant. Especially a sandwich joint, try's Boars Head AT LEAST and don't be cheap!   I could keep going but you're not worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here once after a coworker recommended it because it was right down the road..but I wasn't impressed. My sandwich was $14 bucks and had less meat than I expected"}
{"text":"I was hungry this morning and not knowing this place was here i would have continued driving. I drive by at least twice a month and until recently didn't know it existed. I'm glad i drove by today. New management, and Faith who took my order was one of the most friendly shop owners i've ever come across. I ordred a Bagel egg/chees/bacon/jalapeno w/ deli mustard sandwich. It exceeded expectations. I\"ll gladly go here repeatedly and am excited to try the subs. We typically go to Subway but get dissappointed regularly... This place is definitly worith the trip. You'll not be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in while waiting for my car next door. Lady at the counter was super friendly and welcoming. Even helped me decide what I wanted. Ended up with the Italian Wuxi he as great. My sub was out quick and tasted delicious. They even have Apple Pay! :)"}
{"text":"Just started working in the area recently and have driven past this place a dozen times and today I finally gave it a whirl. WOW, I'm so glad I did. This is not your ordinary sub shop and when they say Full Belly; they mean it! Their sandwiches are huge, FULL of meat, cheese, and your choice of toppings. I can usually eat a 12\" at most places but not here, half for lunch and half for dinner. The place itself is quaint and simple, plenty of seating and super fast service. Highly recommend the Italian sub, definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Very good locally owned business! Good food and reasonable prices. Breakfast food is my personal favorite here"}
{"text":"Return to FBD, but eating in this time. 11:45 on a Friday and there were only two people. Hmm. More arrived after I ordered. Ordered a 12\" Cheesesteak with chips and drink for about $13. They have a decent variety of chips and a plethora of drinks to choose from.   My cheesesteak hit the window in 6 minutes. It was comprised of two 6\" sandwiches which was weird. It was, however, good bread, a few onions, plenty of meat, but very sparse on the cheese. For a cheesesteak, you'd think it'd have more cheese than an average sandwich. Next time I guess I'll get extra cheese.   Overall it was a good meal. Filling, about the right price and most importantly, it tasted great."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is a generic, sterile looking hole in the wall.  Clean and the staff is friendly.  Full Belly \"used to have\" one of the best French Dips in the area... My how the mighty have fallen.  I am a sucker for a good French Dip and Full Belly \"used to be\" be 5 stars. Their French Dip used to consist of a fresh bun, a generous pile of real unprocessed sliced roast beef and a pretty good au jus.  They changed. For the worse. The French Dip may still be on a fresh bun. but the lighter softer cheaper flavorless roll. The kind that falls apart when dipped in the au jus and no flavor. They also switched to a tasteless, processed style of roast beef that makes the fast food chain that starts with \"Ar\" and ends with \"by's\" taste like prime rib at Morton's Steakhouse. The au jus may have been a generic beef broth poured out of a can with no seasoning.  To be fair, I have had other items and they were all good in the past, but I am fearful the other menu items have suffered the same fate and am not going to spend my money to find out when there are too many other options in the area...the place that starts with \"Ar\" and ends with \"by's\" is just down the street."}
{"text":"Nice little deli with good eats! The owners were really cool. One of the best Hot Pastrami sandwiches I've had in s long time!  Jeez the Weez!"}
{"text":"You look up at the wall, and first you think it's a calendar.  Then you realize there are THAT MANY different sandwiches that these people make.    I had the turkey... it's pretty good.  It's just a little deli place with booths and a couple tables.  Kinda empty... but I would expect that since it's so easy to just drive by this place.  The cool little thing about this place is the helicopter hanging off the ceiling."}
{"text":"I've known this place existed for a while. I live nearby. After a recommendation by the guys at Arizona Archery Club down the road I finally decided to try it. The 6\" Club Sub was very good. Piled high with meats and add-ons it was a meal. However, I also had a cup of their jambalaya and it too was really good. This is a modest place and the service is warm and friendly. Several regulars came in while I ate and it's obviously a favorite around here. I will be back... with my new frequent visitor reward card!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice, each time with terrible service.  Came back the second time because it's close to my work.  One cashier (tattooed girl with a sad face), is consistently rude, regardless of how pleasant I was to her. I asked which veggies were on the veggie sub, and she flatly replied \"all of them.\" Since it didn't state that info anywhere on the menu, and she was unwilling to list the 5 ingredients on there, I ordered a BLT.  The sandwich was mostly bread, and more than half of the bacon wasn't cooked, and inedible. I tried FBD the next week, and figured I'd phrase my question differently, \"Can you tell me which vegetables are on the veggie sub?\"  Again, I received the same response.  I ordered it anyway. Took a while to make the sandwich, but I noticed she went back into the kitchen this time. For my order only. Long story short, I felt like she may have done something disgusting to the sandwich, as all of the staff came out to watch me eat it. That will definitely be the last visit to FBD, now that I've found other places close to my work."}
{"text":"Best French dip around.  The quality of the ingredients along with the awesome staff makes this a must stop if your looking for a lunch spot in North Phoenix.  Why pay more for less at the big name shops.  FBD never fails"}
{"text":"To be honest, I've never been so consistently disappointed in a breakfast/lunch spot. Out of the 10+ times I've either eaten in, or ordered delivery, Iv'e have 2 good experiences with the food. The staff is always scrambling, apologizing, & messing everything up. They make a lot of excuses that a deli shouldn't be making. I'm currently forcing down a bacon,egg, & cheddar croissant that has a very small amount of under-cooked bacon, half the normal amount of cheese, & it's soggy. How do you not throw a little butter on the croissant & toast it?? I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE"}
{"text":"First off, you people who chose to go down the street to Subway are well, IDIOTS! this place has the best subs possibly Ive ever eaten! Friendy staff, HUGE subs, and im ashamed to say, i have lived in the area for 8+ yrs and this was my first visit. So I guess that makes me an idiot too! Check them out!!!!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to Port of Subs but it was crazy packed and I hate crowds so I kept driving and found this place thought I'd give it a try. Oops My bad!! The kid was nice behind the counter when I asked what was good. I ordered what he suggested a 6 inch Italian type club for my meat eating brother and a what seemed harmless enough a stuffed tomato w egg salad for myself along w drinks, chips, and a cookie for the kid to go. It was $17. He even gave me a box to carry the drinks safely!   I get to my bro's and we sit down to eat. I open my box and it was ahem a layer of lettuce on the bottom with a totally unripe light pink tomato cut into wedges w the egg salad poured on top. Ummmm it was bad folks I couldn't even bare to take a picture. There was nothing good about this or worth the $6 it cost. My bro is like Mikey he will eat anything well he ate the sandwich but it was drenched with ranch WTF I dont remember asking for ranch. It also had the same pink tomato's in it. Honestly not sure how this place stays open when even Subway would be better. This place gets 2 thumbs down. Maybe breakfast would be better!?!?"}
{"text":"Good price for a healthy sized sandwich  My coworkers and I frequent this place about once a month. If your making a typical American salary, once a month is good.   Well for starters, this place defines the very definition for \"hole in the wall\". It is located randomly in an office complex, surrounded by a bunch of small businesses. If they didn't leave flyers nor was i told about this place, I don't see how I could have found out about it.   The place is a quiet place. Very low customers. Decorations are very plain. But then again, this isn't a family restaurant nor a place to take a date. Its a \"come in, get your sandwich and leave\" kind of place.   The friendly \"always changing\" staff is helpful, and yet to the point. Last time I went, I ordered the avocado turkey sandwich on wheat. They make it quickly, usually about 7 to 8 minutes. The most impressive thing about this place is also the most annoying. Its the over abundance of meat they put into the sandwich.   When the employee served me the sandwich, I was as usual awestruck at how packed it was. In fact it was packed in an inconvenient way. They use standard sized buns but its served open with the meat just packed into it. When I picked it up, it was heavy which was flattering, but how do I take a bite into it? I couldn't close the meat into the buns, and since the avocados were on top, I didn't get the proper mixture that I was craving. At times i was chewing just meat and avocado. the bread and cheese just didn't have enough space to join the party.   Again, this can be said to be a good thing as well, seeing at the sandwich is 7 bucks not including drink or chips. And honestly it was also a little plain. I mean you can literally add anything you want, but if your in a hurry and just want a pre-made flavorful sandwich, your in trouble.   Overall. good place to try if your a sandwich lover. Don't treat your friends though because it can get pricey. Also this is only opened during the lunch hours of the weekdays."}
{"text":"Great portion size, affordable, fresh, locally owned and no B.S.   My girlfriend and I had just moved to the area and were looking for somewhere to grab a quick bite. We asked Siri and the the \"Full Belly Deli\" appeared on our phone. Tucked away off the side of the road, with no real noticeable features on the exterior we pulled in and I proceeded to have one of the best lunch experiences I have had in awhile. The prices are right, the ingredients are real and actually TASTE that way, and a grown man can get a 6 inch sub and actually feel full off of it rather than feeling like you you ate was a mouth-full of bread. Everything was great, simple and easy & I would definitely recommend them to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"You can taste that the meat is NOT fresh. Its packaged meat, its rubberized and slimey. The bread was stale as well...The price was great for the quality of food, I'll give them that...but I'd rather stick with Jimmy Johns to delivery at work. Their menu (the one the delivered to us here at our office) is VERY HARD TO READ and looks like the Elemental Table of Contents...they did not spend the money to have their flyers done at all, looks like someone did it at home on Word or Excel. Sorry Full Belly Deli, I don't recommend you to anyone."}
{"text":"3.5 this is not the FBD of years ago. NEW OWNERS  They have a great menu now. The food is fresh and good.   I had the Smoked turkey on toasted croissant, with pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo. Ir comes with a side of potato salad macaroni salad or coleslaw. I choose the Macaroni salad. It is Costco but was decent.   The sandwich was really good. Nice flavors, plenty of meat.   The place is clean. The staff is cool."}
{"text":"Pricey little sandwich joint and cheap atmosphere.  That's the best way to describe this place.  Indeed, my belly was full -- full of bread.  Where's the beef!?  --- oh the 80's!  My sandwich was mostly bread, lettuce and tomatoes.  The clam chowder was probably the delight of my meal (sandwich & soup combo) Couldn't complain much about the service since it was quick.  The place was super cheap on the decor -- though I did appreciate the helicopter ceiling fan.  Think I enjoyed that more than my sandwich -- Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place. Owners are awesome people and go out of their way to make people happy. Breakfast burritos are amazing, huge, and a great price. Beats the competition hands down. High quality at reasonable prices. Don't pass up the chance to give them a try."}
{"text":"What a fantastic locally owned restaurant! The food is great. The prices are INCREDIBLE! The service is friendly and the place is so incredibly clean! I always look forward to my visits here.   I just adore Linda (the owner). She's so warm and welcoming, with a huge smile on her face. I can be a bit picky with my food and always accommodates my requests with grace.  There's a TV and free wifi so I can get work done while I'm eating (and waiting for my car oil change).  If you EVER have the chance to go, GO! Oh, and indulge a bit and get one of Linda's homemade chocolate brownies. Those alone will make the whole trip worthwhile!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Reminds me a bit of eating in mom's kitchen at home, they take care of you here and are very kind. They were very patient with my friend who had a hard time making up his mind and came out to check on us to make sure we were happy with the food. My sandwich was fully loaded with lots of veggies. Full Belli Deli is not your standard chain sub shop, as the quality of ingredients they use is much higher and their prices are fair. I can't wait to try breakfast here!"}
{"text":"Another great lunch at full belly deli. They need to work on the look of the place but the subs are fantastic."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing good yelp reviews. The club sub was very good with a decent amount of deli meats and good balance of fixings. The only issue was the sub roll was a bit soft and got a tad soggy at the end from the oil and vinegar. Very nice owners came to check how everything was. I would go back again."}
{"text":"I can always count on FBD for breakfast or lunch.  Great food & great prices."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast I have had in a long time. I had the egg, cheese, and breakfast croissant. So good! I am super picky about my eggs and the owner understood my weirdness and made me a perfect egg! Thank you! :) Was fresh and made to order..   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place. Definitely going back! Reuben is AMAZING! Staff great, food great, one of the cleanest bathrooms I've ever been in! Don't go by and miss out. STOP in asap! Yum!"}
{"text":"I've lived right around the corner for 8 years and never noticed this place until last week, however I rarely drive that direction.  It is not very visible from the road and you can barely read the sign on the door.  My advice:  Take it up a notch Full Belly Deli, so people know you're there!    I decided to try it yesterday and I must say I'm glad I did.  Now, to be fair I've only tried one item on their large menu of subs, but it was delicious.  I tried the *small* chicken salad sandwich on a sub roll and it was just about perfect.  First off, this size is huge and filled with meat, more than enough for lunch, especially if paired with chips or a side.  The bread was fresh, the chicken was also fresh and nice chunks of shredded chicken breast, seasoned simply and perfectly.  I opted for no tomatoes, just lettuce but it was really fresh and crisp iceberg (my fave) and didn't have that weird \"old\" taste that subway lettuce always seems to have.  It was around $6, but I'm all about flavor and quality instead of just filing up the gas tank, so I was happy to find a good quality sub shop for that occasional treat.  I took a menu with me to look at (it is pretty huge) so I can pick out what I'll have next time and I sincerely hope it's as good as the chicken salad.  The sign did say something about new management, so maybe some of the bad reviews are from the old management?  Who knows!  I will update my review if and when I go again, maybe I'll take a pic or two.  Oh yeah, the place is really big when you walk in, lots of booths and tables, clean and shiny.  The staff was really friendly and I think the owner or manager was there and chit chatted with us, she was nice.  Thanks, I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"This place is really good. The owner is real nice and never disappointed by the food. Good sandwiches and subs."}
{"text":"Boyfriend having work done on his car over here.. Picked him up on my lunch break, saw the name thought it was cute and decided to grab a bite to eat.   A little over $13.00 for 2 turkey sandwiches and 2 drinks. No chips.  It seemed like it took a little while to make the sandwiches the guy that ordered right after us got his sandwich after we were done eating.   Sandwiches were nothing special.. And kind of like Cheeba hut in the fact that they have the bread flat and pile all the toppings on top which I'm not a fan of.. All the toppings fall off and it makes it hard to eat.  I didn't see refills were 50 cents.. I accidentally filled my cup up before leaving and now my boyfriend keeps making me feel like a criminal.. Just not used to people charging for refills.  My boyfriend said that bathrooms were very clean and smelled good. That for a guys bathroom wins the third star."}
{"text":"I have never met a rude employee in here. Fast and friendly service. I have been to FBD about 12 times between the original owner and the new.  The breakfast egg, potato, cheese, and sausage burrito is great. It becomes 2 meals as it very large.  I have also had several of the sandwiches and find they can be difficult to eat due to their size. I have started having them served as a roll up. Plenty of fresh lettuce, tomato, and cheese if you wish.  The sausage and biscuits is a large serving. I added a few shakes of the salt and pepper to get the taste I prefer. As with other offerings, it becomes 2 meals for me."}
