{"text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant in town, of any type. The food is divine. Every dish. A few standouts:  labneh (strained yogurt),  falafel, baba ghanoush, magadara (rice and lentils, spiced to perfection), tahini salad, feta pita, and the eggplant salsa. The plain pita is tender and fresh. And make sure to finish up with their amazing rolled baklava and a cup of Turkish coffee. The service is friendly and helpful. The chef is very willing to explain the dishes in detail- what spices and how their made. And they do offer a number of their staple items in deli-style takeout containers, if you want a good supply of yogurt or hummos. Don't miss this place! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food. Service was amazing. We ordered to go because they were about to close and we hate making server have to stay till later.  They gave us free samples in the time we waited for the food because it was our first time. If you love great food and love to support local business, definitely gotts have. Wont regret it and it is very economic too"}
{"text":"With my friend we spent our lunch break here, which was a very good idea. Everybody was very nice, welcoming. The food was delicious and fresh! Thanks"}
{"text":"My friend and I went for lunch here - I found this place on Google Search - and the \"Vegetarian\" and \"Vegan\" options on their menu told me they had plenty of options for me. We were a bit skeptical as we walked in because there was no one else other than us during the peak, weekday lunch time but the food and service turned out great. Of all the baklavas I have ever tasted so far, I liked the one here the most (just the right amount of sweetness). They probably do not get noticed that much because they are hidden away in a tiny corner of a strip mall, and they cannot be spotted easily from the road. My friend and I enjoyed the experience and intended making this one of our favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"My 2-year old and I just had lunch at Duzan today and it was fantastic!  The baba ganoush was particularly to my liking as it is made with the traditional and much tastier tehina rather than a mayonnaise base often found in the US.  The hummos was fantastic and the labane hit the spot.  I intend to go back."}
{"text":"This place was a huge waste of time! After my boyfriend read some great reviews on here for this place, we decided to give it a shot as we both are fans of Mediterranean food.  When we arrived it wasn't too busy - there was one person waiting for a to-go order and one table of guests who seemed to be hanging and eating tapas for some time already. Waited for about 10 minutes for our water to come and put in our order. After giving our order, another couple walked in and was immediately helped. This entire time we were completely ignored and it seemed like the host/waitress/cook/helper lady purposely avoided walking anywhere near our table so we can't get her attention.  30 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived. My boyfriend and I both ordered a Shawarma plate so I was a little confused why it was taking so long. The couple who came in after us were then served before we were. By this time, we we starving and I was lucky enough to get the servers attention. She acted like I was crazy asking what was taking so long and why a couple who came in after us was served before us. Finally they rushed the food over and unfortunately, I was even more unimpressed.  Stay away from their hummus unless you like a very bland and dry and thick kind of hummus. The Shawarma was extra dry as well. Felt like sand in my mouth, although the flavoring itself was the only good thing about it. I think the best thing about this entire experience was their pita bread. Other than that, I can almost guarantee I will never return. Maybe someone else will have a better experience. For all I know they were understaffed and in a rush."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food. This is the best I have ever had. It is true. The falafel is a magical thing. It is fluffy and wonderful. The salad dressing is amazing. I got the combo plate and the lemonade. So very good."}
{"text":"Probably the best Felafel I've ever had. Ambiance is a bit low brow but the service is top notch and the food is the BOMB!"}
{"text":"The food was all around good - the hummus was excellent, and the pita was incredible.  The owner was there and said that the pita is made fresh in their other location daily. You can tell that it is."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great find. If you haven't eaten here, get to it! Our days(life) are numbered you know, and it's a shame to keep this food out of your life any longer! Try it all, seriously, it's not a single plate highlight restaurant but a place with all around great and authentic food, drinks, and sweets.   Now I also have to mention the service. I lived in the Balkans for a few years and have family heritage there and nit only was the food authentic, but so was the passion from the owners. Such nice people. We we're there a little later and he gave us extra baklava- that I'll day dream about till my next- and made us feel very comfortable, especially for being first time patrons.   Lep dan in dober tek!  (Slovenian)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so customer-oriented..I'm amazed with the service and the warm welcome of Ab & Amir. I ordered the Shish Taouk (skewer chicken) and it was very delicious. Make sure to order the grape leaves warm, they're divine! All the different dishes, sides, and even the drinks are freshly made. Definitely give their fresh lemonade with mint a try, it won't disappoint. Ab was very kind and gave us complimentary hot tea and a taste of their baklava. Overall, very, very pleased with everything from this restaurant, I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was superb. Would definitely recommend. The baklava was my favorite of course."}
{"text":"My husband is Arabic, so we can the critics. The food was authentic,  quality and worth every penny. The Service Was Amazing and we even went back the next day!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not very impressed with this place. The reviews were good so we wanted to try it. First and foremost- the service was SLOW. Brutally slow. The waitress was super sweet but it was obvious how flustered she was with one table and two to-go orders. It was also obvious she was upset with how slow the kitchen was.  We ordered a couple of tapas which we were finished with way before our food was delivered. When our food finally arrived the meat was extremely overdone. The spices are good, the tzatziki, tabbouleh and hummus are excellent as well. If you like vegetarian to-go food I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My mom and I stumbled upon this new restaurant today.  I always love trying Mediterranean places.  We had the Chicken Schnitzel, veggie combo dish and kibbeh balls.  We also had their baklavah.  Baklavah was awesome, their hummus was great too.  Will go back so I can try a few other dishes there.  The manager/owner Ab was real nice and receptive and helpful."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mediterranean food spot I've been to in Vegas. Having previously lived in the Middle East, I'm quite familiar with Mediterranean/Arabic food. This place definitely took me back home. Their hummus with lamb is delicious. Another one I really enjoyed were the grape leaves, and the mint lemonade! Everything is made fresh, including the drinks. Definitely give this place a try. The owners are very accommodating and friendly. Enjoyed my visit here!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant on Saturday night. Stopped in around 7 to get food to go and the place was completely empty. We ordered the Shish Taouk, beef kabob, falafel, and kids chicken shawarma (the kids wanted chicken fingers but we were told his was much tastier). It was 60 dollars. We were told 15 minutes and it would be ready. We finally got our food at 8:15 and headed home. The chicken shawarma was so terrible the kids refused to eat it, my husbands beef was cooked to a char and he was able to maybe eat the middle out of 2 pieces, the Shish Taouk was edible but definitely not good. We were all starving at this point and pretty much forced the pita and hummus because it was the only thing somewhat decent. We don't go out much but wanted to get something yummy after a long day. Mediterranean food is one of our favorites and to say we were dissatisfied is an understatement. The man who served us was a little pushy, but very kind. All in all, I would never recommend the food here."}
{"text":"I had salmon kibbeh and hummus ...The best ever high quality authentic food. Will definitely become a  regular!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service ,Great  and tasty food,from chicken chawarma to falafel plate with hummus.very nice experience ."}
{"text":"What a delicious meal!  My family and I ate here on a Monday night so there wasn't a big crowd and we were seated and served with the best customer service and best food! My son ordered the grape leaves and we ordered the veggie tapas plate and all shared it. Everything tasted so fresh and the service was excellent. To top it off, the total bill came to $28 which felt like a steal! Highly recommended if in the area or live nearby."}
{"text":"I made a Yelp account just for this restaurant.  My parents and I came in Friday night for dinner.   The owner was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  I ordered the falafel plate. The falafels were really light and the salad also had a light dressing. Very yummy!  My mom got the special which was a stuffed bell pepper. She basically licked the plate clean!   My dad got the shish tauok. I will be ordering this the next time! The chicken was moist and flavorful. So good.  Aside from the entrees, we ordered kibbehs, tabbouleh and hummus. The owner gave us some spicy pickles, olives, hot sauce and let us sample the lentils and rice. I need more of that in my life, LoL.  Overall, we had a great dinner and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place tonight on our way to Trader Joe's and it was amazing.    We tried a bunch of different tapas and they were phenomenal. We ordered the Hummus, tzatziki sauce and Tabbouleh which was served with the freshest pita I have ever eaten.  All three of these dishes was amazing. We also ordered the falafel, grape leaves and the Kibbeh balls which were also amazing. All of the food was so \"fresh\" and delicious.   The restaurant is very clean and very warm and welcoming. The owner/chef, Amer, came to our table and introduced himself and you can tell by talking to him that he has a real passion for cooking.   The service was also fantastic . The server was so kind and attentive to our table.   This truly is a \"Hidden Gem\"."}
{"text":"Better than any food I've had in actual Middle Eastern an Mediterranean countries I've visited. Everyone's food was amazing. Spectacular service, food presentation and beer and wine selection. Prices are good for the nice portion sizes. The owner really made us feel like VIPs!"}
{"text":"Great, flavorful food with friendly service. The spices used in the meats make for a great taste. Also, as others have said- try the lemonade! Its very refreshing."}
{"text":"Family went and sampled much of the menu. Everything was fresh, authentic, and delicious, from drinks to desserts. The owner was friendly and attentive. Try the Kibbeh!"}
{"text":"Now THIS is a restaurant Las Vegas needs more of.  Warm, welcoming owners.  Softly-colored decor.  Clean and roomy.  Quiet music.  It was a relief to enter a place that didn't have TVs blaring sports, congested floor space, overworked indifferent waitstaff, and tacky uncomfortable decor.  And the food...MARVELOUS!  On my first visit, I chose the vegetarian tapas platter.  While waiting for my order to take home, Aab (my apologies if I've misspelled his name) gave me a sample of the vegetable soup and walnut baklava.  The veggies were fresh and crisp; the broth fresh and lightly seasoned.  The baklava was flaky and had just enough sweetness, not drowned in honey like most baklava.  My food was packaged with care.  Everything was delicious and -- can't say it enough -- FRESH.  Most  Mediterranean restaurants make baba ganoush like chunky wallpaper paste and falafel like over-seasoned burnt rocks.  But Duzan's was smooth as silk.  The falafel was crispy with a moist interior (didn't crumble apart in my hand!).   Do yourself a favor and take your family to this restaurant.  Or get lunch with your coworkers.  Or just stop in and chat over coffee and homemade pastries (the chocolate quickens go QUICK, I'm told)."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite local spot ever. The food is beyond amazing. The service is impeccable. The owner Amir always makes me feel like I am the only guest in his restaurant and he's happy to see me: ) I cannot wait to share this restaurant with my friends visiting from out of town. Truly a local gem! Katerina Satori"}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything about my experience!  The atmosphere was spot on.  The entire restaurant including restrooms was clean, nicely lit, with comfortable seating, and light arabic pop music playing.  They make everything in house from the pickles to the made to order kunnafeh.  If you don't know what that is, I'm sorry but your life is not complete.   I was warmly greeted from the first step in the door and truly made to feel like a guest the entire visit.  Service was top notch and everything was exquisitely delicious and fresh.  In my experience ethnic places usually  have one or two amazing dishes, this menu is filled with them.  I will be returning as often as I can."}
{"text":"Best Israeli food in Vegas. The pita and hummus are delicious and the chicken shawarma plate was really good with a very fresh salad. I also recommend the mint lemonade.   This place is owned by the same people that own Amena Cafe which is also really good.   The staff is friendly and the service is great. Try it out."}
{"text":"Had the combo special. It came with chicken  and beef schwarma, hummus and falafel. The chicken I didn't care too much for. But the beef and falafel were excellent.  My waiter was very good, and even let me try one of their special made hummus! The staff was very nice, and one of the reasons I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Their hummus and falafels are SO good! We sometimes get their hummus plate with lamb shwarma, which is a great meal! Combination plate plus a side is filling for two.  Only thing is it can sometimes be a little slow, but it's perfect for meeting friends for good conversation over great food!  Space is also very comfortable."}
{"text":"I recently stopped in w/ my triplets for a quick bite of hummos and pita and loved every bit of our visit. The service and food was amazing. I had to go back two days later for more and was greeted w/ such friendly people and more amazing food and samples. Thank you! We're so happy to have found you! !"}
{"text":"This place was very delicious, the Chicken Shawarma was also yummy as well. Customer service was excellent and the pita bread was a bonus. One of the best Mediterranean restaurants I've been to, can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and fantastic food! Sooo glad that this wonderful place opened in my area. Plenty of choices for meat lovers and vegans alike -- great eating place if you have a mix of friends to satisfy. Don't forget to let them know you used yelp and claim your free backlava -- small enough not to fret over calories and big enough for a wonderful treat!"}
{"text":"Very good. I enjoyed the chicken kabob and chicken shawarma. Great tasting and refreshing homemade lemonade. Owner and staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Being vegan can be challenging sometimes, but Duzan had a great selection to choose from. We started with the green mint lemonade and jumped right into the Vegan Platter which was very tasty. Grape leaves, hummus and fresh pita was delicious   We will be coming back for more and oh yeah Amer is very friendly and makes the experience even better. I've got to go our dessert Kunaffe is here and it looks yummy."}
{"text":"This place opened next to Trader Joes, and I have been eyeing it for a while. Finally decided to give it a try for dinner and they suggested to try the \"Combo special with chicken and beef\" and also other the Veggie Combo.  It was delicious, plus their homemade lemonade was good too."}
{"text":"Every other Henderson Mediterranean place is eclipsed by how great this place is! All of their meats are perfectly seasoned and their falafel has 10x more flavor than the competitor down the street. Their customer service is another great feature, their staff is very welcoming and is more than happy to help in any way possible!   Oh - get their garlic sauce if you like garlic. It's ridiculously good."}
{"text":"Absolutely a must stop !!!! Anytime in in town I stop here.  Love the food ! The shish kabob was to die for . food is top quality.  The appetizer tapas are great if you have a group of people.  Highly recommended !! I'll give them 10 starts if I can"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! WONDERFUL SERVICE!!!! Cindy was our server, we thought she was the owner or at least the manager because she was exceptional. The falafel was the most amazing vegetarian falafels we have ever tried. THANK YOU! We will be back!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had the combo special, beef and chicken shawarma combo, and the kibbeh balls. Everything was great and the customer service was even better! Definitely a place to try and return to!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best falafel I've had in Vegas.  Service was amazing, we came in on a tight schedule and asked if it would be a problem. He said he'd do what he could to accommodate us and gave suggestions for fast items. He delivered, we ate and even had a few minutes to spare so got some takeout items. The hummus tubs togo and hot sauce were a must, and the pricing was pretty fair on them considering the quantity and quality.  If you're looking for cheap food, go elsewhere. The prices are fair, the food is fresh, ingredients are great, and obviously prepared with care. I got a feeling of warmth walking in, and I hope that the restaurant sticks around and becomes a mainstay of Eastern Ave.  I just went yesterday and already wondering when I can come in next time, with more time to enjoy a wider selection."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. The owner was extremely kind and welcoming. The food was freshly made and delicious. I would highly recommend anyone to give it a go."}
{"text":"Food was so delicious - we ordered the combo plate - Y . U. M. We met the generous owner Amer & had such a wonderful time. Great atmosphere! The fresh juices & mint lemonade were amazing! Will be returning without a doubt."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here.  Ordered the special combo plate of falafel, chicken and beef shawarma with salad, humus, and pita. Very good authentic taste.  The owner is a very kind man who takes the time to treat his guests well. Even got complimentary  baklava for dessert which was excellent. A bit pricy but worth it and the best mediterrenean food in the area. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best finds out there!  Ab is an amazing host that makes you feel at home and recommends the perfect dish every time. The kibbeh balls are awesome, the hand made lemonade with spearmint is to die for. Honestly, whatever you choose you will not be disappointed. Try them out once, and all you will do is crave their food till the next time you go in!  I highly recommend this place and will be back often."}
{"text":"Everything I had was good, but what makes this place a 5 star was the owner. He was very nice and gave us a small sample of soup and dessert to try since it was our first time. I love family run joints like this, especially when the owner is highly involved in daily operations. I plan to return."}
{"text":"The best Greek Food we have had in Las Vegas!  Just stopped in after seeing it in the parking lot across from Applebee's.  Glad we stopped!  Great food!  Fresh.  Pita is super light and fluffy.  Hummus tasted super fresh and light.  Gyro was great!  I had the gyro plate and my wife had the gyro sandwich.  Both were great I liked the sandwich a little better.  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Wow! This restaurant is absolutely incredible! I came in on a Thursday night and it wasn't super packed, Senator Harry Reid had just came in with his wife to eat. One of the owners was so amazing and I had some of the best service. I split the Combo Special and the food was so good, but did have a lot of food. We got complimentary drinks and dessert on the house and THE PITA BREAD WAS UNBELIEVABLE! It's house made and cannot be missed. Definitely coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Finally an authentic Mediterranean food in town  amazing food amazing service to say the least"}
{"text":"Best dolmas ever! The tapas plates were amazing and so fresh. Very reasonable prices too! I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Judging by all of the great reviews posted here, I decided to give this place a try. I'm always grocery shopping at Trader Joe's and am always passing by Duzan anyway, so I stopped in for a bite.  First Impressions: Walking into the restaurant, it was a little ghost-town-y because a) it only seemed to have a one light fixture along with little natural sunlight, so it was a little dark and b) there was no one there.  I noticed that there were only two people working there, which seemed a little odd because there should always be more employees working at a restaurant. The owner, although I didn't know his name, was very nice, and he gave us some free samples of baklava and lemonade.  Now onto the food...I ordered the Veggie Combo, which had a combination of falafel, hummus, pita bread, baba ghanoush (eggplant hummus), tabbuleh (salad), grape leaves, and a side Greek salad with croutons.  Falafel - my favorite part of the meal. It was perfectly fried and crispy, and the inside was heavenly.  Hummus - meh. I've had better hummus. This was okay. It was a little too thick for my liking; I would have liked a creamier base. Pita bread - also meh. It was too chewy and didn't seem like it was fresh. Baba ghanoush - a little odd. I remember trying baba ghanoush at another restaurant, and it tasted nothing like the one here at Duzan. This one was spicy. Tabbuleh - I liked this dish. It was light and the flavors went well together. Grape leaves - okay. It was extremely oily, which caused me to not eat it. Greek salad with croutons - well, it was just another salad with croutons. What else could I say?  The pricing was a little over the top for a simple hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant. However, the portion sizes are very large, so I could see why the pricing may be a little crazy.  Overall, I wasn't as impressed with this restaurant as I was with the reviews for this restaurant. The atmosphere was boring and extremely low key, but the service was excellent, and the owner was very kind and welcoming. The food was about 3 and a half stars because I didn't enjoy the majority of the food on my plate, but the ones that I did enjoy were definitely on point. However, I probably would not come here again because I've had better Greek food."}
{"text":"Thank you thank you K shop radio for introducing me to this magnificent Mediterranean restaurant. It's here in Henderson on eastern in Coronado. I don't care what part of town you live in it's worth the drive here.        Besides being clean and comfortable. You can see the food being prepared. If your vegetarian they have lots of things for you too.     Turkish coffee was hot and amazing made fresh.  I'm having the chicken kebabs with rice. The spices are amazing.  Tried Kibbeh balls for the first time    So delicious.   My lunch of chicken kebabs comes with yellow rice and a salad. The salad is fresh season wonderfully basically the whole food is delicious. Plus it's very attractive and very appealing looking     One more quick thing besides being lovely employees.  Asked if I could have a little sample of the lintel soup. And she gave me about a half a cup full and a cute bowl other restaurant would not be that nice for you to try there soup. So now I'll be taking soup home for dinner"}
{"text":"I noticed Duzan on one of my regular trips to Trader Joe's. It's tucked in the same shopping center at the Anthem location. Later, after chatting with the owner, I learned that Amena Bakery & Cafe in the Trader Joe's shopping center on Decatur is run by the same family. In fact, the scrumptious pillowy pita bread served at Duzan is baked at Amena. My brother had told me about Amena, and I made the mental note to check it out, but I'm rarely in the area. Imagine my delight, when I made the connection; Duzan is in my neighborhood and it's fantastic.  We were started with an assortment of olives, cauliflower and pickles. All had a pleasant bite.  I chose the gyro sandwich (don't expect it piled high with meat like greek versions) and the husband had the shish kabob. Everything was fresh and well seasoned. The hummus is outstanding. Duzan has a unique stamp on their menu items since they are made in house with specialty spices, etc. which are imported. If you like spicy, ask for the hot sauce. It is mighty fiery, but it also has well developed bold flavors. Additionally, I didn't get a photo of the coconut chocolate balls or the baklava. Both were rich in flavor, but neither were too sweet. Do give both a try.  The owner is gracious as can be. You can tell he's passionate about his food. It's a great healthful choice! Vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores alike will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good good food love it that's always fresh and delicious so glad you opened one near my house  you must try the veggie  plate."}
{"text":"This is best Mediterranean food ever: I was there 2 days ago with my family, everything was excellent: food and service so I recommend it for you and don't forget to get desert kunnaffa with cheese."}
{"text":"If you want fantastic, delicious food (we had the buy 5 get 1 free tapas) and incredible, fabulous service come here. I plan to become a regular. The atmosphere was pleasant and very calm for lunch. Laura was our server and she was super friendly, kind, efficient and I give her an A+++++. We only came here because we happened to be in the area and yelped it. Glad we did."}
{"text":"They have the best pita and Falafel and Baklava I've ever had! The owner and staff are very friendly and generous!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent! I had the combo plate and my friend has the chicken shawarma plate...both were amazing! Great hummus and tender meat. Best falafel I have ever had--crispy on outside, fluffy on the inside! Will definitely be coming back. Very friendly and welcoming, and flexible if you need to change anything."}
{"text":"The service here was fantastic and the server/owner made us feel comfortable and offered great suggestions.  We ordered the combination plate which had chicken, beef, falafel, hummus, and a salad.  We also ordered the veggie combo plate.  I substituted grape leaves for the tabbouleh salad.  The grape leaves and the falafel were definitely the stand outs.  They were so good.  The baklava was also amazing...Everything they make is from scratch, nothing from a can here.  As we packed up our left overs, the owner gave us additional pita for our hummus which was very nice.  We will definitely put this place in our rotation."}
{"text":"Had a very good and different type of gyro sandwich. Included hummus, lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber. They were super friendly and quick too. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Walked in greeted and seated. Super friendly staff. Ordered the combo special everything was really fresh and tasty. They bake their own pita bread. It's incredible soft and delicious. I was also a fan of the falafel which was crispy on the outside and not dried out on the inside. They also let us sample the bachlava which was amazing. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Was on my way to Trader Joes and did a quick search for a place to eat. Duzan popped up and was in the same shopping center. The person who was running the place was extremely friendly. I ordered the Shish Taouk, house made lemonade, and a short Turkish coffee. The coffee was wonderful, rich with flavor and a hint of cardamom. He offered to make my lemonade with frozen slushy ice since it was so hot outside, and I'm glad I took him up on the offer. He made the lemonade with a bit of fresh mint, which usually I do not like, but it was great.  The Shish was delicious as well, very flavorful but not over powering, great rice, and a little salad that had a refreshing dressing. I am exited to return to the place to try some new things."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I decided to grab some Mediterranean before we got to the airport and stumbled on this place. The food and ambience was great. I ordered the Chicken Sharawama and was not disappointed. The food was made fresh and had excellent flavor. I recommend trying one of their fresh squeezed juice offerings (my co-worker had the lemonade) I would definitely return next time I make it to Nevada."}
{"text":"Flavorful Food + Outstanding Service!  Duzan Mediterranean Cafe really exceeded my expectations.  I'm extremely picky when it comes to Mediterranean food but this place was very clean and everything was so yummy!   I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for some delicious food and excellent FIVE STAR service.  Will definitely be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"I have only been to this place for a quick stop. Had the soup, it was amazing. The owner made sure to let us know that its a family run restaurant, and everything was home made. Then he was very attentive when i needed hot sauce, freakin mind reader! i was thinking, man i need hot sauce and within 2 seconds he came over with the look like, \"oh you know you wanted this hot sauce.\" incredible!  The food was excellent, i had the soup and some hummus and the pita. My wife had the chicken plate. Everything was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and even visually appealing. (see my photo)  We cant wait to go there again and try the salmon!"}
{"text":"This place is great! First, the guy who owns (or manages?) the place is awesome. He is very personable. The location and interior of the restaurant are also very nice. Now, the food. My husband and I placed a to-go order, and everything was fresh and flavorful. The pita bread and baklava were top notch, and our main dishes (grilled chicken plate and shish kabob) were delicious and nicely seasoned. Oh, and the rice was very tasty! The portions were large; the dinner was a great value. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm from the Middle East so I'm expert in the Mediterranean food   They did good job Great place great food  Nice service"}
{"text":"I think I've found a new favorite restaurant! The food is very fresh and flavorful, atmosphere is quiet and clean, service is outstanding... the owner is so welcoming that it felt more like I was dining at his home than a restaurant! A1!"}
{"text":"The food here was extraordinary. The Shish Taouk blew my mind, as did the pita bread and hummus. As far as the service goes, the crew was very friendly and kind.. Also, the exterior was amazing, and the interior was just a good; the restaurant (bathroom and all) were very clean. I wouldn't mind coming back another day. I suggest this restaurant all the way :)"}
{"text":"Best mediterranean place I've had in Vegas. Service was outstanding. Every dish we tried was wonderfully seasoned and of impeccable quality. All the food was consistent in bold flavors and absolutely delicious.  A must try. The lentil and vegetables soup, amazing! You will leave satisfied....."}
{"text":"My boyfriends family and I heard really great things about this place . They definitely lived up to their reviews , the restaurant is very clean and has a very welcoming vibe . The owner was so kind he gave us a run down of the menu , I ordered the gyro and he made it so delicious I love spicy and the hot sauce was on point ! My boyfriends mother ordered the lentil  and rice dish and she really liked it everyone loved their dishes . Definitely recommend this place to try it out , good food and very nice staff THank you !"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. You can tell that everything was made with fresh ingredients, and had a very authentic homemade taste. There were no heavy oils or processed flavors. Definitely 5 stars and highly recommended!! :)"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars from someone like me who is quite critical of quality etc? Because when EVERYTHING that is served is done just right, with the right ingredients and the right balance of tastes/flavors and textures it deserves 5 stars!!! The couscous made by one of the owners themselves is absolutely AMAZING! Superb!! Hummas (as they spell it) was perfect! The Shish Kabab combined with Turkish salad was a combination made in culinary heaven! I also tried their mint tea, home made mint lemonade, Kibeh ( which actually had pine nuts in the ground meat as it should), baklava, Syrian walnut cookie and Chocolate Quickers (not too sweet at all).  This place is owned by two partners one is from Israel the other is Moroccan. The food is made like it is made in their native homes. They have their own bakery so the deserts, bread, pita etc are all FRESH and of great quality. This place is a MUST TRY! WILL LOVE FOR SURE! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mediterranean food. Service was fast and very polite. My wife and I shared the Kibbeh for starters and had the Lamb chops for dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The flavors were a delight. This hidden gem is worth the stop. We'll be back. Don't pass up the lemonade. It's very refreshing."}
{"text":"There are tons of places in town for tapas from different cuisines, but this is the first Mediterranean version I've found! Pick five, get one free- can be a great deal if you pick carefully. Definitely get the eggplant salsa. Props for having several vegetarian and vegan options.  Staff are what make this place, and owner Ab was super friendly throughout my visit- and even gave me some extra dessert treats! Their baklava here is unique in that it's less sweet, and more nutty. I dig it.  But my favorite Mediterranean dish will always be chicken shwarma. The version here is heavily seasoned (a good thing!), available in a plate or wrap. Plate comes with a good side salad and a hefty portion of hummus. My only wish is that they include garlic sauce, as that is what really makes the seasonings of the dish sing."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food! Mediterranean is by far my most favorite cuisine.   I ordered the combo plate; hummus, salad, chicken, beef and falafel. The flavors were amazing!! Perfectly seasoned, but not over the top. I'm usually not a big fan of falafel...however, I WILL MOST definitely eat it here. I literally cleaned my plate. It was also a good serving size.   The gentleman that served us, was just that. Simply a gentleman. Checked on us and opened doors. Superb service!!!   Try to homemade lemonade!! It was delicious."}
{"text":"I have seen this place, and decided to have lunch here. I really never tried Mediterranean food much, but I love that they have many vegetarian options.  I decided to try the grape leaves/ dolmades. I loved them!! The service was great. I ordered hummus to go, wow impressed and delish.   I recommend this place, I will be back to try their lentil soup!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is a joke, this is coming from a middle eastern. The waitress wasn't bad but for a group of people you don't give just two pieces of pita bread. How do five people share that? The silverware is flimsy and the knifes dirty.   The food really isn't that great either, if I wasn't so hungry I probably wouldn't even eat it. This place is gross and a waste of your money."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've had. Our server was great, her name is Cindy! Can't wait to go back to this place and get stuffed!"}
{"text":"This Mediterranean cafe was great. The hostess was excellent with her recommendations. The restaurant was up beat, clean, and the food was perfect. I will be returning. Walk in knowing however that it is not fast food. They prepared the food after we ordered it, so yeah, its gonna take a few minutes, which is why it is so good. Much better than Fresh Kabob or Paymon's."}
{"text":"Here for my mom's birthday. The staff was just absolutely amazing. They suggested the plates for us and everything was delicious. Yes, they may take long serving the meals but I can't complain, you can literally see them make the food fresh and with love. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing service & amazing food! Loved the hummus, pita, chicken, & desserts!! The owner is so gracious and kind. Love it here"}
{"text":"Tried going there at 11:45 am and one of the workers is sitting outside waiting for the doors to open, poor girl in the 100 degree heat says its supposed to open at 11:30."}
{"text":"What a wonderful heathy option close to home! The owners get 5 stars alone! They are so incredibly warm and inviting. I was so impressed not only in their passion but the focus on quality. I swear they had me try at least 4 things while I was deciding what to order. They do as much in house as they can, from pickling their own vegetables, fresh pita, sauces, and baked goods. They focus on healthy high quality food, and the prices are ore than fair. I can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the people are SO nice!  The best Mediterranean food in Henderson and our new favorite lunch spot.  Falafel is great and the desserts are fresh! My favorite is the lemonade with mint! YUM!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mediterranean food! Falafel and tzatziki was delicious, some of the most flavorful chicken shawarma, creamy hummus, crisp salad, soft warm pita, and baklava was perfect!"}
{"text":"Excellent Lebanese Food! Best Falafel and Pita in LV. Hoping they have a long run!"}
{"text":"I read the yelp reviews and decided to try their catering for my wedding. The owner was really friendly and gave us plenty of sample the day we came in to inquire. I ordered some tapas, a salad, the lemonade, and the baklava for 15 people, a small wedding party. The food was delicious!!! The baklava was some of the best I've had, the mint lemonade was a hit at the reception, and the food was fresh and absolutely delicious. The staff was totally professional and great to work with. I recommend their catering service and their food."}
{"text":"Customer service at this place is crazy amazing. I am at loss for words at how wonderful this restaurant is!! I came in for the first time with a group of friends and was worried l about how little people there were, but the food and customer service was OUTSTANDING. I'm really surprised that there weren't more people dining!! There's tons of vegan options for me as well as delicious nonveg options for my omni friends :+D !!! Duzan is a wonderful restaurant and I would happily return a thousand times more."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and amazing authentic flavorful food! Im definitely going to come back and try so more items. Recommending to all my friends and family as well!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!!  You MUST have the homemade lemonade and the baklava!!  They are to die for.  I had the Beef Shawarma and it was EXCELLENT! !!  Everything is homemade!!  If you are in Vegas you need to give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"A new addition to the neighborhood and most welcome!  I've a Middle Eastern food lover and find their dishes excellent.  I was getting carry-out and Ab suggested that, instead of the tapa platter, I buy small containers.  I got much more product for price and now have plenty for multiple meals since everything I got will last for some time in frig.  Hummus, taziki, grape leaves, and eggplant salsa are all excellent - especially the latter, which not all Mediterranean restaurants do well.  Grape leaves are firm and have a wonderful nut flavor with a little kick.  Pita bread is fresh and delicious.  I find the Turkish salad too spicy for my taste, but still appreciate how good it is.  I'll be a regular.  Thanks, Ab!"}
{"text":"I came here a few nights ago in search to try out my first Mediterranean restaurant and was glad I did my research.  Duzan had opened just a few days earlier and  Amer, was extremely friendly.  They were scheduled to close at 8pm but stayed open for us to enjoy the quality food and time.  Some people even walked in after we left and they stayed open for them.   Service: 10  They treat everyone equally and let each person take their time.   Food: 9  Only reason it's not a 10 is because I don't know what to compare it to but I'll definitely be back to Duzan.  I'd like I try out their original location, Amena Cafe & Bakery.   I'm getting hungry... Thank you Amer!"}
{"text":"Love the vegetarian combo platter, it's enough for two. Best baba ganoush (sp?). Hummus is sweet, creamy and delicious. Tabouleh refreshing and lemony. Highly recommend. It's not quick, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"We dropped by on a Sunday evening for dinner. There was only one other table with customers, so we were seated quickly.  The service is very friendly and the decor is nice, but unremarkable. The vibe is better than fast food, but not quite all the way to sit down restaurant feeling ambience.  We ordered a falafel plate, a lamb shawarma plate, a tabbouleh side and a Turkish coffee. The falafel and hummus were very tasty. The lamb shawarma was okay. We received a regular salad instead of a tabbouleh salad and I never got my Turkish coffee.  We ended up being the only table with customers there, so I'm a bit confused why they made the errors they did serving us our meal. What food we did receive correctly was generally good, but for the prices they are charging, I'd expect a little bit more refinement.   Considering the amount of competition in the immediate area, it might be a good idea for them to tighten up their act. Slightly cheaper food of comparable quality is easy to get close by."}
{"text":"I've never seen Mediterranean Tapas before, and I'm hooked. Getting to try lots of small plates of different dishes is perfect for someone who has trouble choosing just one dish (like me).   We did the \"buy 5, get 1 free\" and had the eggplant salsa, hummus, fattoush salad, grape leaves, magadara, and falafel. It also came with good, soft pita. I'd never heard of eggplant salsa before, and it was fantastic -- it's a tomato-based, fresh-tasting spread for the pita that I can't stop thinking about. The pita crisps in the fattoush salad were so light and crispy they practically melt in your mouth, not like the hard-as-a-rock fried pita I've had in the past. The falafel and grape leaves are some of the best I've ever had. And as icing on the cake, just before we left they brought out complimentary sips of homemade lemonade with basil to refresh us before going back into the heat.  Splitting these 6 dishes between two people was the perfect amount. We also had a small order of fries, but I wouldn't miss them given all of the other, more interesting, food.  Ask about their other tapas options -- they had a few when we went that weren't listed on the menu."}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food I've had in Vegas. Every dish was packed with flavor and was made with very fresh ingredients. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Truly 0 Stars, but 1 star so I can post this.  No way this place will make it. Drive an extra 1/2 mile and get Stefanos. We wanted to give this new place a shot since we live close. Mistake.  The Hummus had virtually no flavor, our specialty bread came out burnt to a crisp and our server was clueless. My wife ordered the Greek Salad with falafel, the server brought the falafel out with no salad, then the salad, now the falafel is cold.  All of this food fiasco is taking place to blasting Turkish Club music......Seriously... I could have made a better meal at home. Save your time, save your money and just don't bother.  If you are reading this review, I am astonished this place is still in business."}
{"text":"My family and I love Mediterranean food!  After having a craving for good Mediterranean food and reading all the great Yelp reviews about this place, I was convinced it was worth a try.  The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't impressive either.  The chicken shawarma tasted so strong of curry.  I felt like I was eating Indian food.  I've never had chicken shawarma made with curry.  My son's chicken kebab was so dry. For the quality of food, the cafe style restaurant, and the portion size they give you, I would say they are overpriced.  I give two stars because the place is very clean and they provided good customer service.  We just weren't impressed with the food at all."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Some of the best food in the area and the owners really know the meaning of service. Falafel is crisp and light,  the lentil soup is extraordinary, the made to order hummus is creamy and delicious, and the pita bread is baked freshly every day. They even make an awesome homemade lemonade.   Everything I've had so far has been wonderful and is also very healthy. On top of all that, Ab gave me spices from his kitchen one afternoon for a head cold tea!  What an awesome place. We've started eating there several times a week."}
{"text":"Overpriced. I spent $20 for the shish taouk plate, plus a dessert. The chicken was juicy and fresh, but the flavor tasted mediocre. I would describe the flavor as similar to the rotisserie chicken I buy at Smiths. The hummus was average, I wasn't impressed with it. I asked for no veggies yet they put it in my take out box anyway. I ordered fries as a side with my meal and they were soggy and didn't seem like they were done being fried, I didn't eat them out of fear. The dessert was alright, but it was really too sweet and made me thirsty.  The man who is running the place is super nice and kind! He has a lot of integrity and really shows he wants your business. I like a person who knows the value of hard work, and he really shows passion for his business. It's a shame that I was disappointed with the food all around, yet I do give 2 stars because of this man's fine attitude. Thank you for trying!"}
{"text":"A wonderful little mom and pop restaurant, this is a true gem. Not a glitzy place but nice, warm and very clean.  We came by and had dinner tonight, shared some tapas and a combo plate, everything beatyfully served and prepared and tasting outstanding. Clearly this is people that care about food and what they do which also showed by the impeccable service and family like atmosphere.  If you like Mediterranean food this is a nobrainer."}
{"text":"Just had a really great meal at Duzan Mediterranean Cafe & Tapas. The food was delicious, and the portions were large. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Our house is close by and whenever I went for my evening walk I'd pass by this place. I've always been into Mediterranean food so it stuck in my mind. I looked it up to see what the reviews are and it surprised me to see all these glowing reviews. I finally made up my mind to try it. As people have said, the service is exceptional! The owners are extremely friendly and the atmosphere just makes you feel welcome. The food arrived pretty quickly and everything looked good! I had the sample platter and the beef and chicken were flavorful and very tender. The salad was very fresh and the presentation was awesome. The best part was the dessert! Best Baklava ever! I'll be definitely returning to try all the other dishes."}
{"text":"Me and my wife absolutely love Mediterranean. We found by far the best in the valley. Everything here is made fresh from the baked goods to the soups. It is Definitely not fast so don't come here in a rush but it is fresh so be aware of great flavors. There are tapas on the menu if your not starving. Also service is top notch so it matches the food. If your looking for Mediterranean. Look no further."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for dinner after seeing the reviews on yelp and once again were not disappointed. The waitress that helped us was extremely friendly and helpful at navigating us through the menu. We ordered the grape leaves as a appetizer and unlike most places which use canned processed tasting grape leaves, these were the closest thing to homemade I have ever received at any restaurant! Everything we ordered tasted fresh and extremely homemade. I highly recommend this place and we will definitely will be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Amer, for a wonderful meal.  My husband and I enjoyed the fresh, delicious food.  If anyone is looking for a positive dining experience, eat at Duzan."}
{"text":"I will make this review short and simple. Everything at Duzan is very good to excellent.   We ordered a chicken kabob plate(shish taouk), a side of baba gnoush, a side of tzatziki, and a piece of baklava for dessert. The chicken plate included rice, hummus and pita bread.  All of our food was very good to excellent. It is obvious that everything is homemade with generous portions. Our server was Isabelle and she was super friendly and attentive.   We will definitely be returning to Duzan."}
{"text":"I visited the cafe with my friends! Everything was delicious! And we left glad and satisfied"}
{"text":"Get your Henderson shawarma fix here.  I tried the lamb, and they passed rule number one, which is not to serve it oily or fatty.  I wish I could have more, I gotta try the beef and chicken.  For all of you salad lovers, if you have never tried a salad called Fattoush, try it over here.  One of the best salads you will ever have, and this place makes it excellent."}
{"text":"Duzan is delicious, the lamb is cooked to perfection and has a great flavor, the hummus is fresh and the salad is light and has a delicious flavor. Also the waitress Cynthia is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus \"tapas\" (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the \"Halal\" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in. The chairs are not the standard plastic or wood bottoms and it wouldn't take much to get this place a little more elegant. In the meantime go and see Amer and get a taste sensation fix...tell him Nick sent you!"}
{"text":"One star for the waitress for being nice. I ordered the chicken and the lamb shawarma plates for dinner since I saw the 4 1/2 star review on yelp. The waitress recommended that these plates are their most popular dishes people order. We took a few bites of the meats and my husband asked me what meat is this? The chicken and lamb was tasteless and way too salty. We had to throw it in the trash and make an omelette for dinner instead.  Maybe we are used to California and New York Mediterranean restaurant..stupid husband make me move to the epicurean wasteland."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place for lunch. It's in the trader joes complex on Eastern.  The place was clean and was greeted immediately by Ab. He was really nice and took my order.  Tried the falafel plate which came with fresh hummus, salad and made from scratch pita bread.   Generous portion for a lunch plate of $9.99 (photo below). It was tasty and decent.   Ab offered me their fresh squeezed lemonade as well and it was fantastic. Now if it wasn't lunch time I'd add grey goose to it and call it a party in a cup! In any case, the baklava dessert was also heavenly.   It's a good lunch spot and id come back again!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to LV from Chicago and I miss the variety of ethnic cuisines I am used to.  When I happened upon Duzan while going to Trader Joe's, I just had to try it.  The co owner, Ab is super accommodating and willing to go that extra mile in terms of customer service.  The physical surroundings are simple and clean.  I like that that.  The first time there I ordered tapas: stuffed grape leaves; tabbouleh; falafel; all very good.  The falafel was amazing! and cooked just right, not too dry.  Tabouleh was mostly parsley which is not what I'm used to but it tasted good and so did the grape leaves.  The second time there, I met the other co-owner, Amir, who was also very nice.  I ordered the fava beans, hummus, and falafel.  Again, not made how I am used to but taste was very good.  The fava beans are are diced, with lots of juice, which surprised me - I like them whole.  I gave the tabouleh another try, but still a little too much parsley, not much tabouleh.  Ab said their cooking is from the Nazarene area.  Maybe that is the reason things were made so differently.  I think the similar cuisine I am used was made by people from the middle east.  The baklava is good however, it would be great if they made the different types, some of which are stuffed with pistachio.  All in all, I do recommend Duzan and will go there again."}
{"text":"What a great find! Food was fresh and delicious! Super excited to come back and try new dishes. Count is as regulars! Great little gem of a restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant, tucked into a shopping center next to Trader Joe's, had delicious food made from fresh ingredients.  We had the combo plate.  The beef shawarma was tender and flavorful.  The chicken shawarma, in a light curry-like sauce, was equally good.  Even the falafel, which I am generally not a fan of, was good when dipped in their creamy, fresh hummus.  We topped the meal off with kunaffe, a warm dessert with honey, orange blossom water and cheese mixed into a  bed of crispy sweet noodles.  Fabulous."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Finally real Mediterranean food in Henderson. Being from LA and NY, I am spoiled when it comes to this type of food. I went in and was not expecting much and BOY! Was I wrong! This place is amazing. The service was perfect and attentive, the menu was plentiful and the falafel was exactly the way it should be. You can tell it's made fresh there. The server even gave me a free Baklava and it was beautiful. I will be going back with my family for dinner soon! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! There lemonade is literally the best!!  the falafel plate was delicious! Super nice people, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a very delicious shish tauok lunch with mint lemonade.  The food is very fresh and made to order.  My new favorite Mediterranean cafe!"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent! Best lemonade ever! Lentil soup 5 star! Son had vegetarian platter excellent! 5 star! Husband had schnitzel better than at German restaurant, said a 6 star!"}
{"text":"Ab is a great host!!! Had the chicken shwarma plate, it was excellent. Everything is super fresh.  I've tried a few Mediterranean in Vegas since I've moved here, and Duzan is by FAR the best. Great atmosphere,  reasonable price. This is definitely going to be one of my new spots."}
{"text":"I wandered in during my lunch break after reading rave reviews on yelp, and they were right! The service was great. Super friendly, helpful, and I felt that he genuinely cared that I had a good experience. The food was excellent. I got the combo plate to try a bit of everything. The seasoning was well balanced and the plating was beautiful. You must get their homemade mint lemonade! It tasted like an amazing virgin mojito. And then I finished off the meal with a piece of baklava (also home made), which was light, crispy, and not overly sweet. I'm pretty psyched that I found this little gem of a restaurant and I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Kunaffe!!!! Finally somewhere local to fill my random Mediterranean food and dessert cravings. Excellent food, everything is made fresh. Service is spectacular. Only thing I didn't like was the grape leaves. Sorry Duzan, nothing compares to my grandmother's. :0)  Get the lemonade. And the pita. And the kunaffe."}
{"text":"BAK-LAH-VAAAAA!!!  Their divinely-delicious in-house baklava sealed the deal for me:  airily flaky with just enough nuts and a light touch of honey-buttery sweetness.  For me, I've finally found the best baklava in Vegas at Duzan's!     I also ordered their tasty pita bread, hummus, dolmades, and fatoush salad for lunch which made me feel (only a little) less guilty about gorging on dessert first.  I don't know very much about Mediterranean food, but I will definitely return to try everything else on their menu!  ^_^"}
{"text":"So much Hummus...   I popped in here for a quick bite with the wifey before heading home for some Netflix and fall asleep on the couch. Duzan's decor and table setup needs a major reconfiguration, there's no cozy sit and relax vibe that most Mediterranean restaurants have. Plus it's bright as hell in here!   That being said the food is still pretty damn good. We tried the Hummus Plate, Pita Bread with Feta, and the Combo Special. Honestly, this is probably some of the best hummus I've had in Vegas and the Pita bread is a great compliment; soft, light, and I found out, baked fresh at their other location. They do sell bags of the amazing pita bread for $3 and you get a giant stack of carby love.   The Pita bread with feta cheese is baked together and eats like a pizza. Feta lovers this is for you and honestly a must order if you come here. It's a great starter.   The Combo special is a solid mix of menu items. Beef and chicken shawarma, falafel, salad, and of course hummus and pita bread. This was a Mediterranean bounty that was the perfect amount of food for sharing. The falafels were crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and very tender, but the beef on the other hand was under seasoned and lacked salt. This didn't disrupt my meal, but I would have been upset if this was the main protein on my plate.   I will definitely come here again, if not for the bread, but hummus, and the chicken, and the falafel... you get the point."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I fell in love with this place today! Lots of vegan options, delicious food - my fav was the falafel and baba ghanoush - and friendly service. Prices are reasonable too. Can't wait to go back for the open face eggplant soon!"}
{"text":"Brand new place so it was just me and my family in there eating but oh my, AMAZING service.   Owner was so very friendly and caring. Brought us comp lemonade which was to die for and I don't even like lemonade!   Food was delicious and made fresh. All around a great place, defiantly worth a try!!"}
{"text":"4 stars for tasty and plentiful food. Falafel is really good. I'm a falafel snob and I still say Olive Hookah has the bestest falafel ever. Duzan comes in at second. I ordered the veggie plate that came with hummus, babaganoush, tabouleh, a salad, grape leaves and falafel---that's a lot of food! not to mention they bring you sides of pickles, olives, spicy cauliflower, pickled turnips and best of all, the best tasting pita bread freshly made in Las Vegas hands down!! Soft and pillowy and made in house. I even bought a bag to take home. Before my meal I was given a complimentary glass of their special lemonade which was very refreshing and after my meal I was given a complimentary baklava which I have to say is the best tasting baklava I have had in Las Vegas. I don't normally like baklava because I'm afraid it would either be too dry or too sweet but this baklava was just fantastic! Wow i've mentioned the word baklava 5 times already, lol. I'm giving one whole star to Al, I think he's the owner. He will make sure your visit won't be your last.  He's very attentive and genuinely friendly and I wish him all the best on a successful restaurant."}
{"text":"Another great dinner ..... The Shish Taouk was extremely good and the Kibbe balls were amazing!!!! Ab and staff do a great job! Oh and the Kunaffe was superb .."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem this afternoon on Yelp while running errands on Eastern. What amazing pita bread! The Baklava is outstanding too. Loved the Greek salad. There's lots on the menu and I will be back to try them all! Give this place a try--you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this was probably THE BEST Mediterranean spot I have ever been to! The food is simply delicious and you can tell they made it with love  Food: My family and I are the biggest foodie people ever. This spot for us was much more than satisfying! The food has such a great quality homemade taste & super healthy! We ordered about 3 different plates and side dishes which were all DELICIOUS. Even if you're not that hungry, coming here for their lemonade is worth it!   Setting & Staff: The setting at Duzan is warm & comfortable. The chefs, owner, an waitresses are super friendly multi-ethnically and very helpful & attentive! They make you feel as if you were home  My family (Filipino family) and I came here for my moms bday and had such a great experience here! If you are unfamiliar with a dish, fear not! They explain it very well & chances are ITS DELICIOUS! We plan on coming back for lunches, birthdays, dinner, etc.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE! 3 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place. We came here on a Friday night, and were the only 4 people in the place. The waitress was very sweet and attentive. The service was exceptionally slow. 15 min. passed between when the first person got her vegetarian plate, and the last person got his chicken shwarma. I ordered the gyros sandwich, which came with salad and humus. I did not expect them to put both the salad and humus ON the sandwich. Be forewarned- the gyros is not fresh off a spit, but looks to be the pre-made kind they heat on the grill. Just confirms for us that Stephano's is the place to go. Sorry, Duzan."}
{"text":",      Great falafel place , better then many in this area , large pita that you can barely finish , which is great LOL. Death most fear is very nice the place is very clean I will definitely recommend this place to people that visit Vegas.  5 star falafel  5 star service"}
{"text":"Googled vegan friendly restaurants, and found this place. Generous portions of amazing food. Hubby had the regular combo and I had the veggie combo. The falafel were light on the inside and crispy in the outside. Delicious! Definitely coming back here. Very friendly as well."}
{"text":"First visit and very impressed.  Excellent quality and personable service. Clean, modern interior. An excellent addition to Henderson. Both owners took the time to come by our table and introduce themselves and ask how we liked the food.  Good portions and the quality is obvious.  We will be back many times.  Check this one out!"}
{"text":"So impressed with this Duzan! We came with our daughter and they were extremely nice, made sure we were comfortable and happy the entire visit. The food is excellent and very reasonably priced. My Husband loved the Beef Schwarma sandwich. They make their bread in house and it was delicious. Everything was very fresh.  I also love the decor of the place. Clean, modern, and great color scheme. Very comfortable and clean. The owner was extremely pleasant. We were looking at the Kibbeh balls and wondering what they were, he brought us out two complimentary ones to try and they were delicious! Towards the end he also brought out complimentary bakhlava and a quickee chocolate ball for our daughter. Also amazing! We bought some of the chocolate quickee balls to take home with us because they were so delicious..just the right amount of chocolate. Just an amazing place, I hope they get more business because I want them to stay."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the  beef swarma was extremely tough and service disappointing. Staff is very young and unattentive and needs training in guest service. I did not see owner and that could be problem too. They could learn from Great Greek. :("}
{"text":"Was not impressed with food, service or ambiance. I did not think it was all that. I have had better mediterranean food. I was led to this place for the reviews"}
{"text":"Clean place . Fresh food and exelent costumer service . If i'll be back ? Yes . I wanna try every single dish !"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly, enjoyed the tapas, on my wish list slightly more authentic arabic bread rather than what was served."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place.  My friend and I went for a early lunch and the restaurant is nice and small.  The server was really nice, and very helpful.  My we ordered the vegitarian combo, as well as the chicken shawarma and the beef shawarma.  The food came out quickly and everything was great!  I love that is a mom and pop shop, and food was very fair priced and tasty. I will definietly come back for more."}
{"text":"3.5 star is more like it. We read reviews and decided to give it a go.  We met one of our good friend here for dinner on a Sunday evening.  I always enjoy a gyro so I immediately ordered a gyro plate.  Yes, it's not a mountain of gyro on my plate as a gyro wrap at The Great Greek, but that is not why it's not a 5 star.  It's the taste.  It was just not as bold.  Was decent.  The plate comes with hummus and a small side salad.  The salad was bland to me.  Hummus was ok.  We also ordered dolmas.  Those were small but quite flavorful.  I wonder why they don't make dolmas with ground lamb?  We ordered the homemade lemonade, which included mint.  I enjoyed this drink.  The owner, Ab, is super cool and friendly.  We were super full but he gave us each a bite size piece of baklava.    Overall, the food was ok, but the service was really awesome.  I think I will come back to try lunch."}
{"text":"I came here to order some pickup. I had the Lamb chops-marinated in special seasonings served on a plate that comes with side salad, hummus, pita bread and choice of rice or fries, and also Salmon plate that is grilled filet and also served with side salad, hummus, pita bread and your choice of rice or fries.   I showed the Groupon special and the girl says it's for dine in and I mentioned that it states for 2 or 4 people, doesn't say dine in, she called the owner on the phone and they made an exception. Afterwards, the girl says  the owner wanted to talk to me and he said he called groupon to fix the mistakes.  ANYWHO...the lamb and salmon were really fresh and grilled just perfect, so were the sides.   They should have the prices online. The plates were $19.99 each which was pricey but I am happy it was so good and satisfying.  If you have groupon for this place, it's dine in :)"}
{"text":"One of the best middle eastern food joints I've had since living in Israel, Kuwait, and Lebanon. Now it's not like them exactly, but it's really really good for being in the US!!!  Try: Combo plate Vegetarian plate Zatar bread Feta bread"}
{"text":"Please dont underestimate this place! I LOVE mediterranean so needless to say im very critical of how ut taste. I had the beef shawarma sandwich and OMGGGGG its to die for ! I also tried the lemonade and trust me you wont be ready for the this amazing blended concoction of fresh squeezed lemonade & mint ! I tried the Kibbeh Balls they were so good i didnt get a chance to take a pic be for they were gone To top things off the owner is SUPER NICE!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place. I ordered a chicken shrwarma salad. Make sure to add fries inside your salad. You won't regret it! I will be coming to this place way more often!!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean restaurant that's the place to go to good location by Henderson location I order Pita with falafel and they know how to take care of you as a customer good customer service that's what it's about the owner seems like he's taking care of that business well I enjoy your food and I will come back again.  I do recommend that place to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed and finally some great Mediterranean food on Eastern! The best falafels!! Great chicken and beef shawarma! Will definitely come again and recommend!"}
{"text":"You have got to eat here! Everything is fresh and made from scratch. High quality, delicious food and delightful service. The Mahi Mahi entree was just the ticket after a long day. Enjoyed the outdoor seating as they have afternoon shade. Talked to the owner and he said he located in the same area as the Trader Joes (a couple of doors down) because the people that shop there appreciate delicious fresh food and the effort he puts into it. My only wish is that eventually they can serve wild caught salmon. They make everything from scratch folks so  get your buns over there and BON APPÉTIT!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at Duzan this past weekend.   We ordered and shared several dishes 'tapas' style, sampling plates from a cross section of the menu -- Mediterranean pickles, vegetable soup, chicken kabab, couscous, mixed grilled vegetables, tabouleh, stuffed grape leaves, falafel, saffron-infused rice, salad. Followed by a dessert of baklava and turkish coffee. Mediterranean comfort food.   Amer the owner also runs the Amena Cafe on Decatur. We came in shortly before closing and had the privilege of being served by Amer personally and exchanging personal stories.   Everything was fresh, delicious, lovingly prepared. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with two friends during a long break in between classes.   When we got there the restaurant had no other customers inside. Sweet! It shouldn't take that long then right?...wrong! We waited 30 minutes for our food to come out. Luckily our waitress gave us one little side dish of pickles and olives as well as 1 pita bread per person. We tried waiting on our dishes before eating our bread but our hunger got the best of us. It was good, especially with the white sauce!  My friend and I got the combo plate. It comes with salad, chicken, beef, 4 falafels and hummus. It was a good sized portion. The meats weren't anything to rave about. Not much flavor in my opinion since I had to slather a bunch of sauce on mine. I really enjoyed my falafels though! My other friend ordered the veggie omelette which she said was just OK.   Overall, the food was just mediocre. And I can't imagine how long it would take to get your food if the place was full."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing homemade mint lemonade and fast service! Owner was kind enough to comp our second order of the tasty mint lemonade!! We will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here for a quick lunch today. I lovelovelove supporting family owned businesses so I was excited to try this. The server (who may have also been the owner) was extremely gracious. The restaurant is small and clean and has a fun, warm color scheme through out.  On to the food. We ordered 2 waters with lemon. The water tasted pretty bad and I feel picky saying that, but some filtration could fix that right up. We ordered the grilled salmon plate and the shish taouk plate. They both come with hummus, salad, rice, and pita bread. The pita was really good, as was the hummus. My non hummus eating man is now a believer.  I was warned my salmon would take time since it is \"slow grilled\". I tend to prefer medium rare, but thought I would try it. It was very flavorful! It was not as moist as I generally like salmon, but the spices were so yummy. The salad was typical and the rice was perfect. My bf's chicken was so tender you could cut it with a fork, but the spices on it were a little aggressive which is, of course, a matter of taste. I would say the hummus and pita were the high point, but all was enjoyable.  And our lunch was $45.00 with tax & tip. I really like this place and will go back, but I think that was a bit steep for the pretty decent lunch with the yucky water. Next time I will do the tapas as many other reviewers have. They look delicious. To me, the plates were priced just a bit high for what you get."}
{"text":"Loved the fresh and minty lemonade. Excellent service with great halal food. Loved the combination Shwarma plate.Flafel, chicken and beef all made fresh and yummy in the tummy.  Also tried the chicken steak type dish and loved it. Satisfied our sweet tooth with the baklava and considered it a great night!   Also loved the spicy cauliflower,  olives and radish given as a tapa style before the meal. Happy to have a halal food place which has great food and looks great. Can't wait to come back!  Be sure to ask for the spicy sauce!!"}
{"text":"I visited here while doing a staycation at the M. I absolutely LOVE their lemonade. I had the chicken Shawarma. It was super delish. Everyone was personable and welcoming. I will certainly eat there again."}
{"text":"1st time there yesterday with a friend from California. Must say the food was the best Shawarma I have ever had. The fresh, just made pita's delicious. And I have to say it was the best hummus we have had. Have traveled all over US & this was great & so close & convenient to my home. Will be back. Iced Green tea was freshly made. Owner was professional yet carried on conversation with us that really hit home. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The lemonade was very unique and tasty. The staff was really friendly too."}
{"text":"I ordered the combo platter with chicken and beef shawarma, falafel balls, hummus, and salad with pita. It was delicious! Definitely shareable. Staff is very friendly, food is fresh and homemade. I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, we had Hammus, Falafel, vegetarian omelette, Lebni and the best Pita bread.    The food is amazing and made with real love, really I love this place.  Make a reservation.  This is food from heaven, wow.  Oh and by the way the Baklava is the best  It's the Mecca of Mediterranean food"}
{"text":"The experience here is amazing!!! Food is great!! You are really lucky if you get Cindy for a server!! She is very personable and makes you feel at home!!! We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious from there homemade pita bread to homemade everything honestly you could Taste the freshness in every item we got. Closest thing i can get besides my mothers cooking! It's right next door to trader joes. Great spot will be back."}
{"text":"So delete any other Mediterranean book marks off your list in this area, this is the only one you need.  As others said this is connected to the amena restaurant on obannan, which I was always sad was so far away.  Now I can stop in here for yummy food before my weekly trip to trader Jo's since its on the same parking lot.  I got the veggie combo plate and I have to say the falafal was executed even better at this location. The best falafel of my life.  Crunchy on the outside, not to dense , moist on the inside, not to greasy, and flavorful.  The babganoush is lovely and fresh and Smokey, dolmas have a really rich satisfying flavor.  I always love getting the lemonade with mint.  They blend in the mint and ice and it's nice and frothy, not to sweet , super refreshing.  My boyfriend got a combo and they were so wonderful and replaced the falafel out so he could try all the meat types since he's such a carnivore lol all very moist shwarma meats and flavorful.  He even ate all of his salad which never happens.  They bake the pita bread fresh so it's always delish, and they also have a case of food to go of many of their items.  The desserts are to die for, just the right balance.  To often lately I have been given baklavas that have been so dry and lacking in soul, these are perfection, along with one dessert filled with a firm cheese, and another that looks like it has crispy noodly phillo dough.  In addition the owners and workers just like at the amen location, are wonderful people. Such great service, and food from the heart. You must support this local business!"}
{"text":"Excellent attentive service and delicious food. We shared the Greek Salad and a Combo plate dinner. We are both big eaters and we were stuffed. For desert we had the Chocolate Quickie and Baklava. The Baklava is humongous and mouthwatering."}
{"text":"There are so many great Mediterranean options in this area and Duzan is one of the best. I used my Yelp app to find this restaurant the last time I was craving Mediterranean food.   The menu offers many great options including plates and even tapas. I love tapas since it allows me to try everything I want without eating too much food. Another interesting offering here is fresh juices. The selection is definitely better than similar options in the area.  Our waitress provided great service. She was on top of everything and very friendly. Our drinks were constantly refilled and we didn't wait long for drinks or our meals.   I ordered the Beef Shawarma Plate. There was more than enough food for one person included in this dish. The meat portion was tasty and generous. The plate was served with creamy hummus topped with a high quality olive oil and a very tasty pita bread. The salad on the side was fresh and the dressing was delicious. I also ordered a side of Falafel which was well flavored and had a nice texture.   My husband had the Schnitzel with he really enjoyed. This dish was served with hummus, salad, fries, and pita bread. He also enjoyed Mango Juice which was fresh squeezed. It was delicious and fresh.   I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. You have to love a spot with fresh, delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"I love love love the mint lemonade and dolmades here!  The pita is very good too.  Just wish it were a tad cheaper and that they were faster in getting the food out.  No matter if I call the order in to-go or not, it's never ready when I get there.  Still, love the freshness and I just account for the slowness with allowing more time."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm in love. The chick Cindy I meet there is so awesomely nice and the food is yummy! To the max! The schnitzel is Wow  mmmmmmm I thank you and my tummy is mucho happy lol"}
{"text":"Finally decided to give this place a try yesterday and it's going on my favorite list! Food is delicious and portions are adequate. Delicious food is not the only positive factor but also the cleanliness of the place and superior service from Ab. He is very friendly, polite and accommodating which made our first experience very pleasant.   Seating is limited in the restaurant and ambience is ok but those things don't bother me. As long as the place is clean and the food and service is good then I'm a happy girl!! I am being reminded how good this place is while I am writing his review and eating my leftovers!! Definitely coming back to Duzan!!"}
{"text":"Quick service and fresh food.. Make their own pita, which is fluffy, thick and doesn't get hard. The hummus is smooth and well flavored. Chicken and beef shawarma are more thinly cut than what I'm use to, but it made it easy to eat, and both were seasoned well with Mediterranean flavored. The falafel was my favorite- the purée in the middle of chickpeas and spices was perfect and well ground. The platter size could easily feed 2 people; very large portions! Also served with a salad of lettuce, tomato, cucumbers tossed in a lemon pepper vinegarette. They cater and have a bar with beer and wine also. Happy hour specials 3-6."}
{"text":"Shortly after being seated in this small, casual restaurant, we were served a complimentary sample of their mint lemonade, a small dish of pickled vegetables and another of olives.  All were delicious.  We both ordered gyro plates for entrees which came with side salads, fluffy homemade pita,  plus a choice of either hummus or lebaneh (strained Greek yogurt with herbs), we ordered one of each.  Lastly, we received a sample of their version of Israeli baklava.  Everything was good, but oh so filling."}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation since I was coming in with a large group (9). It was simple and they had put a couple tables together to accommodate. Complimentary treats such as Labneh (strained Greek yogurt with herbs), pickled vegetables and olives, and pita chips were placed on the table as we arrived.   Service was really great! The owner and staff were very friendly and accommodating to our large group. I was asking about their Bourekas since the wall menu says to ask about their flavors and they sent out a plate of three types (Potato, Cheese, Spinach) of Bourekas for us to try! They were all delicious. The pastry is really flaky and all the fillings were great. I would have loved to order these had I not already ordered so much food!  Tapas ($3.49/each) Buy 5, Get 1 Free OR Buy 10, Get 2 Free Hummus Duzan Salad (Lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion) Tabbouleh Fattoush Salad (Pita chips + Duzan Salad) Baba Ganoush Tahini Salad Grape Leaves Magadara (Lentil, rice, onion, spices) Tzatziki Sauce Kibbeh Ball (Bulgar, chopped meat and onion) Falafel Rice  There's a list of suggested tapas on the menu and the wall (slightly different), but you can choose any item from the menu. I went with most of the items on their list except Labneh (since this is already on the table). I opted for Kibbeh Balls, but didn't realize that their Kibbeh is sold by the piece ($2.39) and is significantly cheaper than as a tapa ($3.49) since you only get one anyway. I wish someone had told us (we were charged $3.49 for one Kibbeh). I thought their Tapas was such a wonderful way to try most of the menu, but it's not a very good deal. You're paying the same price for four pieces of Falafel as a small bowl of Tzatziki sauce. Also, Pita bread does not come with tapas, so that needs to be ordered separately; I was told it was going to be $0.79/each, but I don't think it was on my bill?  My favorites: Baba Ganoush, Magadara, Falafel, and Rice. They're already some of my favorite Mediterranean dishes and these are just particularly great versions of them. This was my first experience with Magadara, but was easily one of the best parts of my meal. I would absolutely order all of these dishes again.  I would skip the Labneh, Fattoush Salad (it's literally the same as the Duzan Salad with pita chips thrown on top), and Tahini Salad (bowl of tahini sauce with diced tomatoes).  Lamb Shawarma Sandwich ($9.99): A nice sized sandwich, but sadly, no accompanying sides. The lamb was tender and the overall, the sandwich was good. I didn't love it, but the tahini and hot sauces helped it a lot. I would probably opt for the plate next time.  I also tried the Chicken Shawarma, Schnitzel, Shish Kabob, and Fries. Everything was good. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The fries lacked a touch of salt, but I liked the spices on it.  Turkish Coffee ($2.99): Wonderful spices and a really beautiful aroma. I had to ask for sugar since there was only a low-calorie sweetener available on the table. The coffee was so lovely with just a touch of sugar and it was perfect with dessert!  Baklava ($2.99): Delicious. I guess the owner likes to play around with the shapes (haha), so tonight we got large Baklava cigars. It was tasty and not overly sweet like some baklavas; this one actually crumbled.  Kunaffe w/ Cheese and Walnuts ($8.99): Turkish pastry of semi-soft cheese and walnuts between layers of crispy Kadayif, served with a light syrup and crushed pistachios. This is crazy delicious. It's served hot, so the cheese is gooey and the Kadayif is super crispy with a nice sweetness from the syrup. Highly recommend this dessert!  Great spot for Mediterranean eats!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite restaurants!!! i come here all the time and always order the veggie combo plate. the pita is always fresh and they have excellent vegan options!! i recommend this place to all my friends. the service is also great!"}
{"text":"Excellent! The lemonade is made with fresh mint blended into it and it is amazing. The vegetarian combo was also exceptional; lots of food and tasty.  Here's the kicker: my dad had schnitzel! Seriously. He's German and he said it was the best schnitzel he ever had. It was apparently so good he had to tell me so three times."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch excellent service. Food is very tasty.  I had shush Tauok ( chicken kabob) delicious .  My husband had a gyro very good"}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service! Had the lamb chops and lamb shawarma plates both included hummus and pita.  I'm typically picky when it comes to lamb chops but these were seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Also had the baklava which was a nice treat to end dinner.  They also have happy hour!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Cute atmosphere and GREAT food! Was too tired and satiated to write more on my first visit.  Came back for second meal and now telling all my friends and family.   The food is fresh... they even make their own homemade sauces. I am going to try the tabouli the next time. Just found out two locations:  East in Henderson by the Trader Joe's...West on Decatur in the Trader Joe's shopping center.  Everyone from the chef to the waitress' is friendly and welcoming and they leave you alone to eat!"}
{"text":"The food here is so addicting!!! The service was amazing as well! Best falafel in the world!! I was told they will be serving beer and wine soon! Even better! Thanks duzans!"}
{"text":"I was craving Mediterranean food and found this on yelp and was so glad we checked it out! My boyfriend had never had it, so it was perfect that they had tapas. Also, the owners and staff were so nice and the chef even brought out a little appetizer for us just to try. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place we tried today for the first time.  Excellent food - fresh and tasty dishes. The hummus and the chicken kabob were wonderful.  The waitress Was friendly and the atmosphere pleasant.  We recommend that you Give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic tasty Mediterranean food.  One of the best middle eastern foods I've had in Henderson.  Fresh baklava and a great lemonade!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent & customer service was great! Plenty of vegetarian choices."}
{"text":"I'm picky about food.  As an aspiring vegetarian food choices can be a challenge. Especially at restaurants.  This is my go to neighborhood spot for delicious high quality flavorful healthy food.  The food is so delicious I'm doing a wiggle but happy dance sitting in my chair as I'm eating it.  Try the dolmas for sure.  The make them hot here and it's fabulous.  They have a sweet little beer and wine bar for a drink with dinner. I'm enjoying a nice Pinot at the moment.  The service is gracious and attentive.  I wish this business owner every success and encourage this neighborhood to patronize this establishment. You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Have been going to a lot of Mediterranean places lately but this has got to be on the bottom of me list. While the service was fantastic, the veggie platter that I ordered was quite bland and that included the babbaganoush and hummus. The taziki wasn't that great either. I will give them kudos for the falafel!    If you want good service, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really don't look at reviews and stuff because generally I dont care for other people's opinions and I dont post any because it's too much work, but damn, this place was good. I had the chicken shawerma plate and it was the most tender fully-cooked chicken I have ever had.  The ambience is chill, and there's a bar so you can get a couple of beers in like I did. I was seriously surprised that there were so few people inside the restaurant at the time because it was way more delicious than many other places on the same street.  Really hope this one takes off because it deserves it. Definitely gonna be a regular here. Highly recommended, simply for the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food.  Fast service, great flavors, and amazing baklava. Get the dolmades and gyro. Delish."}
{"text":"Delicious!   We head falafels and dolmades, finished with baklava and chocolate quickers (fudgey chocolate balls with walnuts coated shaved coconut).  Everything was amazing!   Everything here is made with real food and love.  Have to come back for gyro and shawarma!"}
{"text":"Duzan , Henderson's newest Mediterranean restaurant right next to Crepe Shack.  I came across this place while pigging out on some crepes next door, the following day I decided to give it a whirl since I noticed there has not been any yelp postings.   The unique thing about this place was their meats were \" HALAL\" or should we say kosher ( Blessed meet) and they also offered  Mediterranean tapas, which was rare for a Mediterranean place to have, from what I have experienced.  For all you Vegans and Vegetarians they have a pretty good selection. I did the Tapas buy 5 get 1 free the tapas were about $2.79 each.   Being 80% veggies I ordered the Tabbouleh salad ( vegan), Fattoush salad ( vegan), Taziki Sauce, Hummus ( you can choose the flavor you want i chose garlic), Grape leaves ( vegetarian), and I ordered the lamb shawarma.  Everything I ordered was delicious and was very flavorful, I really loved the grape leaves and the tabbouleh salad. The lamb shawarma was okay the meat was a bit dry but still okay. They bake everything fresh at the place, their Baklavas were to die for, It was not to sweet it was perfect! They also offered other middle eastern pastries and breads. Their menu options was great I will definitely go back to try their meat platters next time.   Overall, I had an awesome experience at this place and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"First of all, don't be fooled by the beautiful photos of food on the menu & website. That's not what you'll be getting at all. The food was fine, but the sauces are a little odd. The falafel sandwich comes with tahini sauce, but that sauce is in a ketchup-type plastic sqeeze bottle brought to the table. The falafel itself was delicious. The Gyros plate comes with your choice of just one sauce/topping: lebneh or hummus & then a \"salad\" which is little more than a bit of lettuce & a pita. It's about half the food that's shown in the photo. I think the sandwich would have been a much better deal. Some prices average, some very high. For now, I'll stick with my favorite Gyros place: Yanni's."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today with my fiancé, the place was super clean, the owner was very welcoming, the service was suburb ..We ordered the combination plate & shawarma plate, let me tell you the food was delicious, best shawarma & kabob I've had in Las Vegas. The lentil soup & hummus were amazing also, every single bite was delicious. If you like Mediterranean food or want to give it a try this place is a must. Oh Don't forget to try the baklava & katayef for dessert YUMMMY !!!"}
{"text":"The food was not only healthy but filling and very tasty.  The homemade lemonade was super too.  The lady that served us was a delight and very welcoming.  A refreshing experience that my girlfriend and I will return to.  I hope folks out there give it a whirl.  Right next door to Trader Joes."}
{"text":"This place is so nice. The owners are professional and friendly. The atmosphere is nice, there is a lot of elbow room.  I ordered a salad and some hummus. Yummy. Everything was fresh. Not sure how the portions are , depends on appetite I guess but they didn't look skimpy to me. The bread was amazing!!! Seriously bread and carb addicts consider yourself warned!  It could be a bit pricey just for lunch for some people, too bad they don't have a few cheap lunch specials to choose from. But it isn't overpriced either.  Good quality ,healthier food choices too. ( Next I am going to try the soup!)  ** Small update. 2/3/2015... Tried the soup.. Amazing! well made! Home cooked , just right. Bumping up 4 1/2 stars! :)"}
{"text":"I have never posted a Yelp review before, but after going to Duzan I felt like I had to.  This is hands down the best Mediterranean food I have ever eaten - certainly the best in the Las Vegas valley.  Yes, the service can be slower than other quick casual eateries, but everything is homemade and made to order.  If you want a greasy Americanized gyro, this is not the place for you.  Everything is fresh and full of flavor.  This is a local, family-run business that truly cares about quality and their customers."}
{"text":"Been craving GOOD Mediterranean food here in Las Vegas. Luckily, I found Duzan. Great food. Nice, clean establishment.  Friendly staff. Out of this world HOMEMADE LEMONADE and BAKLAVA! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Big fan of mediterranean foods, and this will be a new favorite.  Super nice service, very fresh food.  Apparently they bake all breads and deserts at this and their other location.  I can say everything tasted extremely fresh.  Soup, appetizers,  kebabs, and a few other items were all super tasty.  I did find that I needed to add a bit of salt to a few items for all the flavor to come out.  This is not a bad thing as lots of folks like less salt, and way too much can destroy a good flavor.   Its a mix of a few different ethnic foods really.  Some dishes were Israeli, others were more Lebanese styles and then to see shnitzel on the menu was interesting.    Anyway - its a cross between a full sit down restaurant and quick service.  Not a fancy restaurant setting, but not 5 min or less for your food.  Be prepared to watch as your meal is cooked.  Will absolutely go back for more."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding and the staff was very friendly. Homemade pita bread and a Mediterranean style lemonade made for a delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Great authentic food all round. Tapas are a fantastic way to sample their menu. We've been here six times and they have been excellent each time. The owners are gracious hosts. They remember us each time and always take very good care of us. The Turkish salad is amazing albeit a little spicy but delicious. Their pita is made on site and we always take some home with us as it freezes well. Do yourself a favor and eat here. If you like Mediterranean food you'll love the full flavors at this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in while we were shopping.  They gave us olives,  spicy cauliflower, pickles & pickled turnip as before meal finger foods. Both of us got the minty lemonade, which is refreshing & tasting.  As an appetizer we had the baba ganush with soft, fresh made pita bread.  Very tasty.  For an entree I had the lamb shwarma & my boyfriend got the gyro. The gyro came in the soft,  pillowy pita bread as well. Beautiful presentation of the food. The lamb was well seasoned & big portion. It was served with a salad & hummus. Everything was very well prepared.  We will add this to our favorites."}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food I've had in the U.S.!!  Everything is amazing.  Try the eggplant salsa, the falafel, the homemade lemonade and the baklava.  What a great new gem in Henderson!"}
{"text":"DUZAN IS THE BEST!!! My friends and I come here probably once a week and always get the veggie platter which is unreal. Creamy baba ghanoush and hummus, flavorful tabbouleh and more! Their pita is probably the best, warmest, and softest in town. Tons of vegan options for me, and my non-veg friends always love their chicken/shawarma/etc. Definitely one of my favorite Mediterranean spots in town, and always wonderful and friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"Really awesome place! Everything they make is fresh and delicious. The Shish Taouk is mouth-watering. Also, grape leaves are my absolute favorite and I really judge a place by their grape leaves. Duzan doesn't hold back, they have the best grape leaves, so fresh! They also have the best Flalafel which has a perfect taste with the Tahini.This place is better than Stephanos and Yalla. If you are in the Henderson area, this is the Mediterranean place to go to, my new stop. Ab, one of the owners is awesome! He was really cool and made me feel welcome and I was just getting take out!  The other owner is Amir, who I met later.Thanks guys! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This is the very BEST Méditerranéan restaurant with Very authentic, fabulous tasting cuisine!!!! The staff is very nice and they are warm people.  So today, I went to get my favorite hummus that they make like no store bought hummus , or far eastern restaurant, or cafe.  And what do I find?  They are closed.  Not just for today!  Forever!!!! .?????? WHY?  Now a French bistro will take their space.  I fear this is not in response to the new 2017-bigot-racist eletoral college dictator America has been issued by the antiquated electoral college that invalidates the popular American vote.  This was the VERY BEST restaurant in the neighborhood. Extremely good!! Now.  There is Nothing.   Myself, and many others will miss Duzan. Such a classy restaurant."}
{"text":"If you like a lil wine with your Mediterranean food, Duzan is the place to be!!! Delicious, fresh tasting, & authentic. The ambiance and service is great!! Must come and check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Clean restaurant.  Ordered a homemade mint lemonade which was delicious! Falafel sandwich and a side order of hand cut fries, falafel was moist and had just enough sauce. My partner ordered the combo platter which he enjoyed. The side pita was very good. The baklava was flakey and perfectly sweet. Portions were generous! Customer service was very attentive."}
{"text":"I'm going to put this out there I found the Best Mediterranean restaurant in all of Henderson!! Everything tasted like it was lovingly made and packed with flavor! In comparison Duzan makes all of the other Mediterranean/Greek places seem bland and sad.   We ordered:   Special combo plate (falafel, beef and chicken shawarma, hummus, pita, salad, and this onion jam thing)  Lamb Shawarma sandwich   It's the best falafel I have had. It's not dried out or flavorless. And dipped in their amazing, homemade tahini and hot sauces...I can eat way too many of these! Speaking of their sauces they have a garlic one too and if you're a fan of garlic like me you'll be asking for seconds to dip everything on your plate in it!   Fluffy, warm pita bread on the side and I can cram it myself with the meats, ridiculously smooth hummus, and the refreshing salad! I was too happy to eat here.   My boyfriend and I didn't talk much through this meal cause our mouths were too busy eating.   Lastly our waitress and the owner were both super nice! They made sure we were taken care of  and even let us try their baklava and mint lemonade before we left! Great drink for these hot days. I would describe it as a virgin mojito. And I usually don't like baklava cause it's too sweet and the  honey syrup makes the layers soggy but it's a different animal here. Crisp, crunchy, sweet and most importantly nutty. I had a free sample but i bought two more to take home."}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic food and wonderful service. The owner is very friendly and took great care of us. We ordered the tapas grape leaves, the chicken shawarma, and shish kabob plate. All excellent. Some of the best hummus I've had too, served with warm pita bread.  I highly recommend this place.  * It's the sister store to Amena's on S Decatur."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good place to eat after hiking in the area, and came upon Duzan. We really like Greek and Mediterranean food, so we decided to check this place out. We came on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't very busy. The service was prompt and courteous. We got the chicken shawarma, the veggie combo, and a feta cheese flatbread. The specials are a good value, very filling! The dolmades were warm, which is not what I'm used to but they were excellent. The baba ghanoush was smoky and delicious, and the hummus was also good. The falafel were perfect, not too dry, nice and crispy outside. The chicken had great flavor, and both the side salad and tabbouleh were dressed nicely and made good compliments. Nothing was sub-par.  The owner came in while we were there, asked how we liked the food and where we heard about the restaurant. He then gave us complimentary baklava and turkish coffee, which was a great finish to a satisfying meal, and enough to compel me to write a review about how great this place is. I can't promise that you too will get free baklava, but it's worth going regardless."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Duzan as there are so many good reviews and everybody was so nice but the food was just alright. It was nothing special, far from great, and everything was a bit bland. It was also a bit overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"The food was extremely fresh and absolutely delicious.  The stuffed eggplant was presented beautifully and exquisite taste."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was outstanding!  The Felafel was the best I had ever had. I would highly recommend the combo plate. Remember to save room for the Baklava and Turkish Coffee."}
{"text":"I am a F&B nut.  Let me tell you how great this place is!  It is fantastic!  Friendly staff, clean clean clean establishment.  The Kitchen is a showcase kitchen so you can see your food being made.  Best of all, the food is a flavor-bomb of awesome.  Hummus is top notch... Tabouleh is clean and crisp... the shish taouk is great!  I live in SW Las Vegas and I will drive to Duzan during rush hour when I want Mediterranean.  Duzan has made it to my top 5 list."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. A sweet couple running the restaurant.  Try their homemade lemonade and mixed plate."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews for this restaurant we decided to come and dine here. It was a Sunday afternoon and we were hungry. The place was empty, as we walked in we were greeted by a friendly waitress and a manager/Cook. They asked us where we found them, we said Yelp. Let's talk about the food experience we ordered:  Water, it tasted really bad, not sure if it was the water or the ice. (They should check that) Tabouli salad, it looked great but it was dry had too much cucumber and mint.(they don't have cucumber on their menu description) Shish kebob was dry and not fresh, one of the sweet spices in it didn't make it any better. The french fries were soggy and greasy. The whole wheat pita was really good. The gave us baklava for free, it tasted good.  We love Mediterranean/Middle Eastern/Israeli food, for over 30 years we have been eating it at friends homes and restaurant's, in Los Angeles, NY, and any where else we can find it, this establishment didn't do it for us."}
{"text":"Service was friendly but slow.  The staff would vanish into the back for extended periods of time.  The food was decent.  Not worth the price or the hassle to go back again.  Also, the hours posted here on yelp and on their website were different from what was posted on their door.  The internet said they open at 1100 but when I arrived their door hours were changed to 1130."}
{"text":"My family of four, including my two toddlers, had the best dinner experience. The service was great, the pita bread was amazing, salad fresh, and the meat choices were flavorful and lean. This is by far the best mediterranean food in Henderson. We will be back soon! (My little ones loved the chicken and falafel)"}
{"text":"Very good Mediterranean food and great hospitality!  Also very reasonably priced. Will definitely come back again!"}
