{"text":"Used a Groupon today to eat here and they gave tiny portions compared to normal and a sharing charge for one of my little kids.    Food was ok but the restaurant is dirty and bathroom always out of order....Dont use a Groupon at this place as they rip you off on the food portions."}
{"text":"I was about to leave, and I should have, as I stood at the hostess stand for 5 minutes waiting to be seated.  After being seated and placing the drink and food order (which took a while) it took 45 minutes until food came.  Came with two hungry kids (7 & 8) and no kid menus or anything to color with or on.  Yikes! Tables surrounding us had dirty plates from previous customers indicating that they were short staffed but you would not know it, as the server showed no sense of urgency or a 'sorry we're a little understaffed tonight'.  There was bad show, as additional tables were used for additional condiment storage rather than in a discreet location in the back.  Booth seats were lumpy with springs popping through.  This began to take it's toll on my back after the first 45 minutes just waiting for the food.  Eventually we had another server appear out of nowhere that was a bit better, but not enough to justify any kind of decent tip.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place for a breeze in lunch and go.  the thom yum is amazing!"}
{"text":"We've lived less than a mile from this restaurant for the past three years and just tried it tonight. We will be back. Excellent service, delicious fresh food, and the owner went out of his way to welcome us.   My husband always asks the server for their favorite dish - Blue Sapphire Basil. We tried that and the popular Mango Curry and were not disappointed. I read some of the other reviews, and am not sure what they ordered because both our dishes were awesome and we are really picky with Thai. For dessert we chose a Mango smoothie over the traditional sticky rice (because I am obsessed with smoothies) and it was also really good.  Apparently they also have take-out. Bring on the yummy."}
{"text":"There are several contributing factors to the 3-starness of Papaya Thai, but it isn't necessarily the food.   This place is literally a block away from my house, and I have ventured frequently because of its proximity, reasonable pricing, and portioning.    Giant fish tanks with some cool tropical fish are strewn about, but then there is this tank with the ugliest eel-like fish and catfish.  It makes it hard for me to eat looking at them, so I opt for seats facing the opposite direction.  I also feel like there are too many tables for the amount of space.  If the restaurant where ever full, I think I would knock into someone's head with the imaginary purse that I do not carry.   Now onto the food.  I love that there are spiciness scales that I do not adhere too.  I always ask extra, extra spicy, and they don't just throw a handful of red chile flakes into the dish that I order.  Every curry dish I have ordered has tasted the way it should, not like coconut milk or peanuts.  The price isn't terrible for the portion.  I always have enough left over for lunch the next day.  Try it out.  P.S. I think they are under new management since my last visit."}
{"text":"Best thai food in Mesa, and you get so much food for your money. We have tried almost every thai place in the area, and think Papaya thai is by far the best - and always ends u p being the cheapest too. Only eating here for thair food for now on!!"}
{"text":"Made a to go order that cost 37$ that included the fried duck, samurai shrimp and spring rolls. The location came from just a couple blocks down from where I live. Finished a long day of work so wanted to order out. Took a hour and a half for the delivery person to arrive and I swear to you when I open the treys of food I found there were more veggies than meat. I felt like a darn rabbit!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered food at 10:30 or so, didn't show up until 1:00am after I gave up and went to bed,  The delivery driver complained he had to come from Phoenix, like it was my problem, and demanded tip before he would hand my order over. I had a big order and gave him 20 bucks, I should have gave him .20 cents  Food was cold, but was decent after I reheated it, and not my complaint    Your delivery driver ruined it for me."}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to try this place in Tempe because our normal Pho Place we go to (Nhat's off of University/Rural) was closed that day. We saw somewhat okay reviews and thought we would judge it for ourselves. Upon arriving there was no one to greet us as we awkwardly stood there for more than 5 minutes. An older Vietnamese lady walked up and offered to seat us. The decor was pretty standard 1980s styled vinyl booths, and when she offered to seat us by the window, there were FULL ON HORNETS IN THE BOOTH! I'm not even kidding. They were coming in through the crack in the wall and hovering at the table the lady offered to seat us at. We did not feel like getting stung to death while we ate, so we sat at another table. Unfortunately, another couple walked in right after us and were immediately sat at the booth of death and for some reason didn't notice (yikes!). The chicken pho had no flavor, and the noodles were just okay. I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"Good food, decent service. The food is really tasty, the price good, the atmosphere is kinda low rent. Not a \"first date\" place to go, but good thai food. I go here about twice a month."}
{"text":"Just got my delivery order and I'm SO disappointed. I don't usually write reviews, and I've never given a place one star. It took 1 hour and 40 minutes for them to deliver my order (their ETA was 30-60minutes). I ordered crab wontons and pad Thai and neither one was worth the wait. Crab wontons barely had any filling and the pad Thai was the worst pad Thai I've ever had. Little to no chicken, flavorless. I hate to throw food away, but I don't even want to waste calories eating this!"}
{"text":"I have never dined in. The restaurant itself is always pretty slow but the takeout is delicious. I really enjoy the soups. I have tried a number of entrees and they have been delicious. The lady dish I tried had sauteed pumpkin. It was something I have never tried but it was great!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 dishes: Flaming Shrimp, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and Mango Curry. Also ordered the spring roll and crab wontons.  All the dishes were spot on!  The server was friendly, but a little standoffish. Management was attentive and came around several times to check on us. Water glasses were never empty for long. Very good food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery but the order didn't go through.  The restaurant is very close so I decided to just drive there to carry out.  Ordered the authentic Pad Thai and the Tom Ka Gai soup.  Carry out was very fast.  The food was excellent, fresh and just the right amount of spice.  Funny thing was 2 hours later the owner called me to say they received my order and were trying to deliver it.  Upon explanation she was apologetic and canceled the delivery and a refund was processed.  Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible order was inaccurate and delivery was really late.if I could give no stars I would do yourself a favor and not order from here blandest food ever."}
{"text":"This is by far the dirtiest restaurant I've been in, in a very long time. The table cloths hadn't been washed probably ever, the high chairs had black goo on them and the dust was pulled so high on literally every thing in sight. I have no idea how they would ever pass an inspection. The service is awful, no one checks back with you. And the food was horrible! The pork was cold in the Phad see ew, shrimp was cold in the other. The bar b que pork was so tough that it was inedible. I would never go back. If I could give this review no stars I would."}
{"text":"Just don't waste your time or money on this restaurant.  Their website is much more impressive than their establishment.  We tried this restaurant because they touted their $4.95 lunch specials in their mailer.  My friend and I went in, but guess what?  The lunch specials aren't even on the menu.    We waited ten minutes after being seated before we were asked for our order, at which time we asked about the lunch specials and were told, \"Chicken Fried Rice or Sweet & Sour Chicken.\"  After asking for one minute to look back over the menu because the options for the lunch menu were pretty slim, we waited another ten minutes until we were asked for our orders again, even though our menus were clearly closed and stacked on the edge of the table.  My friend's water glass had lipstick stains on it.  The water tasted like lemon-flavored dish soap.  The table was sticky.  My overall impression of this restaurant was heading downhill super fast.  Then our food came out.  My friend's fried rice was mushy, and her veggies were burnt.  My sweet and sour chicken tasted like stir fry covered with Manwich.  I've never had tomato-based sweet and sour in my life.  Nasty.  Then we were ready to go, and had to go to the register because no one would bring us our check.   The service was horrible and we felt like we were treated poorly because we ordered the lunch specials.    We will not be returning to Papaya Thai, and will tell anyone who will listen to avoid it.  This was my friend's first Thai experience and she says she's unlikely to ever try Thai cuisine again because of it.  Yeah, it was that bad.  (and the indigestion that followed for both of us was extremely unpleasant)  And it's not family friendly either.  Head down to Mint Thai on Gilbert Road between Baseline and Guadalupe or drive to Malee's on Main or A Touch of Thai in Old Town Scottsdale.  These restaurants are superior to Papaya Thai in every respect."}
{"text":"I really hope it's better if u actually go to the restaurant. I ordered delivery and it was not good at all. The flavor wasn't too bad but the noodles were really mushy."}
{"text":"If this was just my own opinion, it would be a 2 star.  My husband convinced me to rate it at 3 stars.  Let's start with the place was dirty.  We arrived at precisely opening time.  Only one other customer there so far.  And yet there were crumbs under the table and splatters on the wall.  The walls are white.  You don't have to look hard to see these yellowish splatters everywhere.  IMO a person cleaning would have had to simply ignore them.    The table, plates, glasses and cutlery appeared clean (though the appetizer was served on a plate covered in aluminum foil so I could not actually see that plate.)  Next, my beverage.  I ordered a soda.  Turns out it was flat, very flat.  And so once I got the waitresses attention she just says she thought there might be a problem with it.  REALLY?  Instead of testing it before bringing it out to a customer, she just served questionably flat soda?  That's ridiculous.  On the other hand, my husband got lemonade and it wasn't from powder or anything.  There was pulp in the glass.  He liked that a lot.  Appetizer.  Just a simple Shrimp Tempura.  There were 5 shrimp for $5.95.  And they were small shrimp.  Usually for an order like this you get jumbo shrimp...  at other places anyway.  Ok, so the Shrimp Tempura I ordered came fried in a breading, NOT in TEMPURA!  Disappointing except for the fact that they were so crispy they made noise when you bit into them and the sauce was damned near the BEST sweet and sour (with a touch of hot) sauce I've ever had in my life.    My entree was orange chicken.  the sauce was kind of barbequey-orangey.  Something new for me.  And It was really good.  Wish there was a better variety of vegetables besides carrots and onions.  The worst part of the dish was how long it must have sat before it was delivered to my table (there were only 3 tables filled at the time, so they were not busy.)  My fried chicken was soggy.  And soggy fried food is  gross.  So I ended up removing the fried bits and just eating the chicken without it.  My husband ordered Pad Thai, with a spice level of 4.  he said the dish was fine except the spice level was really low (more  like a 1.5.)  Because the place was dirty he didn't want to add any heat from the table... a little too questionable.  My husband said he would like to eat here again.  I'll skip it."}
{"text":"My kids and I are loving these new flavors!  We like spice, but a #4 is a little hot for some of us. Delicious.    My 3 yr old was thoroughly entertained by the tanks of fish. Waiting for our food was accutally fun while she played peek-a-boo with a fish. Yes, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pho, a Vietnamese soup, and got it with tofu and veggies. Traditionally the veggies come with broccoli or bok Choy. This came with green peppers in it which was odd. The broth was good, just didn't enjoy the different veggies in it which is not like a traditional pho. I also ordered Vietnamese crispy rolls, which usually comes with lettuce and bean sprouts to wrap up in with fish sauce. It came with just a sweet and sour sauce and was a little disappointed. The server was a little rude and didn't seem happy to even be there. Overall I give it 2 stars."}
{"text":"HOT MESS!   Food was \"eh\"... Service was seriously lacking! Too bad.... Owners / Mgmt. nowhere to be seen...."}
{"text":"Awful! Where is the flavor?! I ordered delivery tonight and got the egg rolls, Tom Kah soup and Authentic Pad Thai. Every single item lacked any flavor. I even asked for the soup to be medium spicy and the pad thai to be medium to hot. The Pad Thai has got to be one of the worst I have ever eaten. There is no egg, no tofu and no peanuts which is listed as included on the menu. It literally is just greasy noodles with a few pieces of chicken and a wedge of lime. Terrible, I won't be ordering from this place again. Do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ordered in. The ordering process was super easy. In the comments I added that I had a sleeping baby and to please knock lightly. The food came in half the expected time, and they were respectful of my request! Had the Pad Thai. It was delicious, probably top of list of the best I've had. Crab wontons were great too! Will definitely be back. Great food, great service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"First Trip here via Groupon.  The whole experience was just great!  the food is fresh and you get A LOT for your money.  I had Pad thai which is my favorite.  I liked the fact you can adjust your heat level.  I am a woose and I had a 2 and it was just perfect for me.  And I had leftovers  YUM!   My hubby had chow mein with beef at a lever zero (he has tummy issues with spice).  He too enjoyed his meal.  We will definatly be back."}
{"text":"If you want a honorable good Thai place go to Thai chili a few blocks down!! used to like this place, but it has gone down hill!! The service is awful foods not great, and they out of no where started charging to sub out items $2.00 ea... -never write reviews but this place is BAD"}
{"text":"I don't think we're ever coming back.  No one acknowledged us when we first came in.  Some lady was in the back talking on the phone.  She came up and finally seated us while still being on the phone.    The place is dirty.  The floors are sticky and tile has holes in them.  The bathrooms are terrible.  We should have walked out then but we had a groupon and felt obligated to use it not to lose our money.    Eventually the lady hung up and took our order.  We ordered mix appetizer, pad thai & pineapple fried rice. After several minutes of waiting - another person came up to the table and took our order AGAIN,  She had no idea what we had ordered.  The food came out.  It wasn't terrible but very uneventful.  Mix appetizer had crab wontons, egg rolls, tofu, and chicken satay.  Chicken satay was nice but basically chicken tenders rubbed in cheap curry from the grocery store.  My pad thai had very strong tomato paste taste to it which was weird. Hubby's fried rice had a very burnt taste to it.  After 15 minutes I ran out and threw my food up outside... literally... I am still sick as I am writing this the following morning."}
{"text":"Dude seriously read the f#@$?!& reviews! I know i should have! My meal was 39 minutes late. Totaling 1 hour and 46 minutes to arrive. Also my vegetables were hard and undercooked. When I called to complain about my food the lady that originally took my order over the phone (Vee the owner) told me that she also \"cooked my food AND delivered it.\" Girrrl stop lying!  My delivery driver was Hispanic! Shake damn my head. Vee the owner  was extremely rude and blamed that on her lack of English Language skills. Ok fine, as a Hispanic minority I can except that. However, she then said they were too busy and that she could fix it the next time for me. I insisted that she either fix my food TONIGHT or she give me a full refund immediately. I told her that if they were too busy to just give me a refund and she said, \"Oh no, lady you don't listen, you just think out your mind, I fix for you.\" Thinking out of my mind? Ummmmm, well yes, my mind is where I think from? WTF.  She then asked \"did you eat it all?\" Of course I didn't eat hard vegetables you fool! She said she would fix it within 25 minutes (IT TOOK 40) and that she wants her hard vegetables back. Which is fine by me because I do not eat half @$$ cooked vegetables. The delivery driver was argumentative and claimed that she didn't want to argue but \"my food was just fine, because she'd order it plenty of times.\" It is safe to to say that I will never order from Papaya Thai again. Also the fact that the owner stressed the importance of  receiving said hard veggies back makes me wonder if they redistribute them to other customers. Unacceptable service and food. FAIL!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Papaya Thai for the first time this week, after trying another Thai place in the area that I didn't like. I was thrilled to learn that Papaya Thai has Vietnamese food as well!  I stuck with Pad Thai, however, as it's always the mark of a good Thai restaurant. And it was delicious!!  They have \"regular\" Pad Thai and \"authentic\" Pad Thai. One is on the sweet side and the other tangy. I tried the authentic, because I hadn't had it before, and it was excellent. The serving was huge -prob 2-3 cups of noodles with chicken and other fixings.   The restaurant is not fancy but it is clean and comfortable. Service was fine and fast, but we were there early.  Prices were very reasonable.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We order delivery from here almost once a week.  The food is fresh, flavorful, and the delivery is typically faster than the posted time frame.  We're very happy to have stumbled across Papaya Thai!"}
{"text":"The best Yellow curry we've had   Very attentive and know their food    Excellent eating experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Delivery opinion: It's not authentic, but it hits the spot since Mesa is pretty much a food desert. This is pretty much my go to place when I don't want to cook because they have delivery and the prices are decent. Their peanut sauce is pretty good. Other than that, the flavors are sub-par for Thai food. I normally order my food Thai hot and I've either gotten barely spicy or not at all. The Tom Kha soup is pretty good, and it's a really hard dish to get right, so that's a plus. The spring rolls are pretty good, and I'll actually order $15 dollars worth of food just so I can get the spring rolls delivered. It takes an hour for the food to get here and I literally live a mile away."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Thai food I've had. We've gone to a lot of thai places all over the valley and the flavors and quality of the food here is the best. Yes, the ambiance isn't much to look at but who cares with great dishes like the Phad thai, mango curry and vegetable rama.. three of my all time favorites. They are very reasonably priced and you get huge portions. We usually get two meals and a snack out of one order. If you're uptight about little dive locations, this may not be the place for you, but if you want great food, Papaya thai rocks.  We've taken my Aunt who lived in Asia for 35 years there and she thought it was the most authentic she's had since being back in the states. Love it!"}
{"text":"Coconut soup with hot level is SO GOOD!  Drunken beef also pretty delicious.  Portions are HUGE.  Love that they deliver."}
{"text":"Moving to the Phoenix area was a shock to begin with and it has been difficult finding truly great Thai food establishments, especially in the far East Valley. However, of all the places I have tried, which is nearly 15 in just under 2 years, Papaya Thai on University Dr. in Mesa is the absolute WORST!   I am a HUGE fan of all styles of Thai Food. I've traveled throughout Asia on more than one occassion, taught English in China and spent years seeking out authentic eateries in the Asian-based areas of this country's biggest Metropolitan cities. Thai food holds a special place in my heart, but never have I been as disappointed as I was with my experience at Papaya Thai!  If Papaya Thai was worth the words, I would gladly go into more detail about the atmosphere, the menu and the quality-to-value ratio, as I do with my other reviews...   However, there's really not much to say about this dark and dirty hole-in-the-wall next to the Dollar Store. The service isn't worth the price of tipping, the food is as hit-and-miss as it gets and the owner couldn't care less if he loses a customer, which, judging by the fact that not a single person came in during the entire 45 minutes I was there on a Tuesday during prime mealtime, is something he must excel at!   For the record, I haven't sent a food item back due to an issue in over 4 years. Unfortunately, Papaya Thai effectively ruined that streak for me...and on their signature \"Pad Thai\" noodle dish, nonetheless!   The sad part is that what I got in return, besides a table-side confrontation from a rude, know-it-all cook (who told me I could not order the Pad Thai there anymore!), was even worse!!!  Simply put, I won't be back. If the food was even half-decent, I would have gladly chocked the experience up to an unfortunate coincidence and happily given it another shot. However, only 1 of the 3 entrees we tried (a chicken curry dish) was even edible and the prices they demand are among the highest of all such restaurants in the area!   There are many, much better places in the area to spend your hard earned cash at if you crave the taste of Thai food!   Avoid Papaya Thai!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery which was our first mistake. After a few mins trying to place our order on the phone and 3 different people that we talked to. The order was suppose to be here in 45 mins took over 11/2 hours. The 2 different kinds of curry tasted great all except the missing meat that was supposed to be in both orders. The side of rice came with a brown white rice mix that wasn't asked for or wanted.  The pad thia was OK it lack luster. The sticky rice with mango usually the highlight of the meal for us tasted awful and it sitting waiting to be tossed in the trash. Over all I should have made a few pb & j's and save the 50 bucks for crap food."}
{"text":"The owner, \"V\", does not pay employees on time, always in cash with no pay stubs. They have rats in the ceiling and overall dirty."}
{"text":"Food eh. Place filthy. Bland Pho. I pray the kitchen was cleaner the the actual restaurant. Will NEVER return. Disgusted."}
{"text":"I would give this 3 stars, but I really couldn't get by the \"greasy spoon\" atmosphere of this place.  It's not just the decor, the longer I sat here (which was awhile, kind of slow service) the more I saw how much this joint needs to be CLEANED.  Went here on a Sunday at opening.  One waitress and a groupon special going on which I must've missed out on.  She was a little frazzled, and messed up every table's order.  We got vegetable curry, vegetable pad thai, and Tom yum soup.  The curry was very good, but the rice seemed to have been, ahem, reheated.  She brought a different pad thai to the table than what was ordered.  The soup was so-so, for the price I wouldn't order it again.  Everyone around us was sending food back.    As a carry-out this place would probably rate higher.  The forks were in a coffee cup on the table, the \"condiments\" had been sitting out all night and everything in this place needs to be wiped down.  The kicker came at the end when I asked for a bag for the left overs....the waitress stuck her finger in the pitcher of water at the beverage table to separate the plastic bag from the stack.  Carry-out if you eat here"}
{"text":"I don't know what all of the bad reviews are about, I love this place! Love any of their noodle dishes and the duck. They have the best crab cheese wraps I've had here in AZ!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is filthy dirty. The curry is very bland and the staff member was very disrespectful to me. I will never be going back."}
{"text":"We tried Papaya Thai again after a long break. They have rearranged the space and it is so much better. We had the noodle soup as we were craving pho. We were pleasantly surprised. The broth was great, tons of big veggies and just enough spice. Service isn't awesome, but not terrible. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Their soups are fantastic. The service has been less than great when we have gone, but the good is excellent."}
{"text":"this is still my go-to thai delivery near my house.   i still order the yellow curry w a level 3 heat.   the rating drop is for a few reasons. they seem to have dwindled on the amount of chicken you get. also they've gotten really slow. last time i placed an order, we waited an hour, called and they hadn't even left yet. we ended up canceling our order and going out. i felt bad but we were starving.   i give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered the samurai pad tie,vegetable tempura,and yellow curry.  All three are very good.  This is a solid place.  If we lived in the delivery area we would order food often."}
{"text":"Really great Thai food in Mesa, not all that glamorous inside but the food is really really good. We had Pumpkin Curry (WOW!) and Massaman Curry (WOW again!). Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible, delivery person claims she didnt know east from west, manager was nice and refunded my money."}
{"text":"This place was gross. It used to be somewhat nice with cleaner food. I tried the Vegetable Pad Thai and it tasted like spicy ketchup was mixed into it. Springs are visible through the seating. Very uncomfortable atmosphere. Just no."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good. Reasonable prices. I will say that my husband isn't super fond of Thai food but this is his favorite place."}
{"text":"I have always had good food from here.  Big portions with lots of flavor.  This place is our regular Thai take out"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Thai food in the valley. We get takeout at least once per week and have never had a bad meal. The owner, Vy, is almost always there and is very focused on great food and great service. I have eaten Thai all over the U.S. and this is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"they say they close at 11 well its 10:51 and I've already had to call me back and tell me they're not going to serve me because they don't want to I thought business is business if you're open to a certain time you're open to a certain time don't close early because you know what you just missed out on $44 fucking dollars lady tried to tell me she was the manager refused to give me her name as well as told me she didn't care if I called back and spoke tomorrow I will definitely be doing so but I will never order from these people"}
{"text":"I was dying for some drunken noodles, saw this place close and gave it a go.  They open at 11, I tried 1058, no one there realized how early and killed time at the dollar store, came back at 1114, still not open, started to leave and someone ran to the door to unlock it, still had her purse on so I know she just walked in the door.  I ordered takeout drunken noodles and asked how long it might be since I know they just walked in, 5 min.  I didn't know whether to be happy or scared.  How could that be ready in 5 min? It was obvious they took old stuff and just re fried it, pretty greasy and nothing tasted fresh.  I am not one to know authenticity, but I had some drunken noodles in San Diego that I am trying to find something similar here.  This is my 3rd round with the noodles and just a few other times eating Thai apart from that, but this was my worst for sure out of all of them.  I don't know Thai food real well, but I know fresh, and I didn't get anything fresh here.  Also, smelled like old lady moth balls"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would.   !!!!!!!!DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!   Called at 8:15 to place a delivery order, woman who takes order is VERY VERY VERY RUDE, always , all the time, Everytime!  I just got my order now at 10:02pm she told me it would be an hour, I called restaurant back around 9:50 and asked if there was a problem and she said the delivery driver was trying to get ahold of me..... not once did I get any phone call that is why I ended up calling the restaurant, normally once an order is taking long the restaurant will give me the drivers number to call and see if they can find the place or not. She gave me the run around, she calls back insisting that the driver has been calling me, I've literally been on my phone reading my news feed since I placed the order so I don't miss the call, no one calls she tells me she can give me 15% off the next order, FUCK THAT! I want a full refund if that's the case. She then tells me \"you don't have to yell ma'am \" yes the fuck I do, the customer is always right in this situation instead of trying to lie and say a driver has been calling me why don't you shut the fuck up and Listen and Start keeping track of your drivers. This place is trash they delivered to my job twice and both orders where incorrect. This is my 3rd time here I usually do not like to write off a place after one bad experience, however THIS IS THE 3rd the only reason I order from Papaya thai is cause Soda Bun doesn't accept payment over the phone.   Customer service sucks Delivery needs help And food is Not as good as Soda Bun.   This is officially my last time ordering there.  I'm also going to make sure my entire office gets Soda Bun Fliers and never order from Papaya Thai. This place really lost a good customer I Eat Thai food regularly so they would of Been wise to keep me.   Hope no one else makes this mistake   we called and told them the curry is yellow not green. The women States she talked to the kitchen and they said it's Green..... I uploaded a photo .... it's not green curry and there is no bamboo shoots in it.   I'm like 7 months pregnant trying to get fucking dinner and this women wants to get smart with me on the phone and Start being very tacky and saying \"first of all let me explain to you \"... how Fucking rude is that. How fucking rude can u be to talk to a customer like that. What kind of disrespectful ass people work for this company."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of the Thai culture as much as the food  for it's diversity it's extremes. There is something about fresh food that is easily processed and just \"feels right.\" A meal at papaya Thai  is a surefire way to boost my energy for the rest of the day. Unlike most other meals, I never leave hungy, always end up with 2nds(a to go bag), and get to relax in such a soothing atmosphere. Their food hassome kick so even a 2 out of 6 is respectable."}
{"text":"Finely executed Thai and a welcome respite from the mostly dreary East Valley dining scene.  And the many, many gallons of fish tanks.....very, very nice."}
{"text":"Thai cuisine happens to be one of my personal favorites, so when a friend invited me out to eat here, I was definitely looking forward to it. The place was completely deserted despite the fact that it was dinner time. I try not to judge a place based on the number of people who are there because there are plenty of great restaurants that get overlooked and equally as many that are terrible and crowded.   Papaya Thai fit neither of these bills. It was a very mediocre thai restaurant and was a bit overpriced. There are certainly better options in the area and I probably wouldn't go back although I found the food to be fairly satisfying (I got the mango curry). The one thing I do have to say was a complete fail is the water they brought to the table. It tasted like dirt and was extremely warm. I was absolutely disgusted."}
{"text":"I and my husband tried Papaya Thai when we were on vacation. That was our first time at this restaurant and we loved it. Decorations were pretty unique and interesting; foods were authentic and delicious. We are missing the taste of Thai food  and wish there is a Thai restaurant like Papaya Thai here in Wisconsin"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good quick stop, kinda dated nothing special as far decor goes, don't expect any glamor.  I have only been here for the lunch special and I got the same item both times jus different levels of heat, Thai Rice with Pork is pretty good the Chef knows his way around the dish, the flavor compliment the meal quite well.  I can recommend this establishment with no problem, but as I stated I have only had 1 dish twice and no complaints."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant two stars instead of one because the recipes can be really good and they have large portions.   I really liked the food at this place but every time my boyfriend and I would go there, SOMETHING on our order would be messed up(whether it was incorrect, burnt, or had a floating hair)...and we came here approximately 1 time  every other week- so it happened a lot. The last time my boyfriend and I went there they forgot chicken in my chicken fried rice and we decided that we were never going to go back there because there were a couple other great places just a little bit farther from home.   Today, I decided to give them a twentieth chance and I went back there on my own to get pad-se-ew and when I got home I realized that they cooked it without sauce.   I couldn't help but laugh but I had to throw it out because pad-se-ew without the sauce ended up being super gross and now I will officially never go there again."}
{"text":"We won't be going back to this place.  The only good part about the experience was the drinks.  The Thai tea is great.  The food was okay but nothing special.  The decor needs a major update and the restaurant could use a good cleaning.  Someone needs to call Robert Irvine.    The two things that make this place a 1 star review are the service and the price.  The service was some of the worst service that I've ever had in a restaurant.  We order three entrees and an appetizer.  After waiting about 15 minutes, our first entree arrived.  Somewhere in the next 5-10 minutes our appetizer arrived and then finally about 5 minutes after that the remaining two entrees arrived.    We finished eating and had some food left over.  After about 10 minutes of the waitress ignoring our table, we decided to stack the dishes in order to get her attention.  Yeah, that didn't work.  We waited and tried to get her attention and after another 15 minutes we were successful.  We asked for To Go boxes and put our remaining food into the containers.    After receiving the check, I was surprised at how much the bill was for the meal.  It definitely was not worth the price.  At this point, I just wanted to pay and get out of the place.  I placed my Amex card into the card slot adorned with American Express logo next to the statement of them \"gladly accepting American Express\" to be told by the waitress that they don't take American Express.  I don't know if I was more shocked by contradiction in credit card adornment or by the fact that the waitress was actually at our table.  I paid the bill, left a normal tip, since the waitress was hovering around cleaning the table as I tried to fill out the bill.  I then did a balancing trick with our takeout boxes since I wasn't afforded the luxury of a bag (maybe you need to spend more in order to receive a bag) and hurried out of the place with my family.  I was excited to try a new place near our house but sadly the experience was lacking and I won't be returning.  Hopefully the next place we try will be better."}
{"text":"I have gave them many chances to redemption them sleeves even called for them to have the opportunity to make it right but that ended up becoming even worse, then tried them again and it blew up in my face again.  Shame on me. I will tell everyone to stay far away from this place every chance I get"}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE your money here. The food is garbage and the place is filthy. If you bought a Groupon for this place and haven't used it yet I suggest regifting it to someone you don't really like. My food was burnt and had no flavor. Tum Nuk Thai is way better spend your money there."}
{"text":"Awful! My lovely wife and I spent the worst dining experience we could remember over the past 27 years. Now where do I begin.... Ordered Chicken Satay and Fried Wonton for appetizers. After 23 minutes, the wontons appeared. They were fine. When they arrived I complained about the 23 minute wait. The waiter then went into the kitchen and passed that on to the chef.   In the 23 minutes it took for us to get our wonton, they filled a 6-entree order to go and the couple near the door recevied their entrees. Note, there were only 3 tables occupied. When the satay arrived it was not grilled and not on bamboo stick as described on menu. It was fried.  10 minutes later I got my BBQ-Chicken which was not bbq, but stir fried and had to ask for sticky rice. I calld the waiter over who said he couldn't help right away since he was busy w/the other 2 tables that had customers. When he arrived I questioned the preparation of the satay and my bbq-chicken entree. He then went into the kitchen and talked shit about me.   I then confronted him and the chef and they had nothing but lame excuses about talking about us behind our backs. When asked about the wrong preparation about dishes, I was told that's the way they do it. No remorse until the end when the chef offered more crappy food as an apology. Reason she came out was since the waiter was now on a delivery run and she was alone, yes ALONE in the restaurant to do everything.  My food was poor. My wife's was unispired. Stay away if you value your tastebuds and good service"}
{"text":"Food was gross, it was so greasy that it made my daughter throw up. Never again. The service wasnt bad, which is why they get a star...but the food, I have had much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"REAL BAD EXPERIENCE!!! DONT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!   Where do i even start, the restaurant wasn't very packed at all and it took us an hour to even get our food, the guy that served us rushed us the whole time and wouldn't stop telling us how busy he was (I've worked in fast food before, you NEVER stress your customers with your problems, ever!)..... there's was some first timers walking in and the waiter dude did even take their order or serve them for a whole 30min..... the Grub Hub driver showed up ready for his food and the waiter said \"we're packed so I'm letting you know it'll take longer\" and the grub hub driver said the app said the food was supposed to be ready 30min ago and we left before he did..... we also never received our $5 worth of egg rolls..... don't go here, we aren't"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Twice now I've gone. The first time they put onions in my pad Thai. Who the hell does that? Doesn't say it has onions on the menu. So whatever, I'm over it. I go back to give it a second shot. I get the panang curry. How can you screw that up? Right? I get home and guess what? More onions!!! Again, didn't say it had onions on the menu. If you didn't notice, I hate onions. Also I don't appreciate paying 10 bucks for a meal, when your menu lies about what's in it. Screw you papaya Thai."}
{"text":"This is what you get when you have a chef that is chinese making Thai dishes.  I ordered Panang Curry and the taste, the color the vegetables the whole thing is off.  It looked like Southern Biscuit Gravy when I opened the container.  The pork was not a good consistency, it was all chewed up and not like this dish is supposed to be.  I have been to Thailand and this is my #1 favorite dish.  I was kind to give this mess 2 stars."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! I wish I could give zero stars. I gave this place a chance. I really tried to like it. We ate in at the restaurant twice and ordered delivery twice. We finally had to swear it off for good. The food is average to bad depending on the day. But the service is awful every time. All four times we had Papaya Thai, one of our orders was messed up. And both times we ordered delivery it took two hours. Most importantly, the employees here are so rude! This place is less than a minute from our house but unfortunately we will be going elsewhere when we feel like having Thai food."}
{"text":"Went there the first time on a Groupon the food was amazing have been back for times since and although the food is good the spice level is very inconsistent. We always order level 3 but sometimes its super hot and other times its so mild. The service is always slow even when no one else is in the there. Overall this is a good place for thai food. Could use a good cleaning."}
{"text":"This place used to be a favorite of mine. I would go once or twice a week and 2 days ago I picked up an order and got massive food poisoning afterwards . 2 days later and I'm still suffering."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch because it was close to a work thing I was doing.   I don't know Thai food too well. I had the pork pad Thai and the sauce tasted like spicy ketchup. I could not finish it. Not sure if that's how it's supposed to taste, but I couldn't handle the taste."}
{"text":"I'm really sad that I had such a bad experience here. The waitress really lacked quality and was devoid of personality. She had a bad case of RBF. We ordered egg rolls which came out quickly, but were cold. They tasted fine, like freezer or Panda Express quality. The cook forgot to make our fried rice and then made it and it was delivered to our table. I ordered a 3 (on a 5 scale) and it was ridiculously hot. To the point that my mouth was burning and my chest was hurting a bit. I found it to be strange and thought I just got a bad bite, but it was all ridiculously hot and honestly just devoid of all flavor. I was not impressed. I give this place two stars because the fried banana at the other table did look quite good. The other waitress who helped us was very kind at least.  I feel like this place is incredibly hit or miss, unfortunately for us, we had a miss."}
{"text":"So here is my review.. I order food online from the yelp app at 7:15 and got my food at 8:37.. Extant ion was 45 to an hour..special instructions weren't so specially to say lots of soy sauce on the side.. I was ol u provided with 2 little 2 go cups barely filled with soy sauce.. They had the cheap soy sauce at that (lay choy) instead of kikoman.. There are certain things u can't skimp on.. My egg rolls were a little greasy but still crispy after all of the wait.. I also got pork fried rice which was hot upon arrival but the pork was bland.. Hence the need for soy.. I doin dnt have a car today and had to order delivery.. Not too many options in my area.. I want to hold help accountable as well.. If a place does not deliver timely or anywhere near it they should remove that option from the app.. With that being said the driver was extremely nice.. I would order again if I had no vehicle once again"}
{"text":"Never received a worst delivery in my life. The delivery girl began by calling and wasting my time asking me to explain to her where I was in my complex even though I gave them a building number and there is a map at the front. Not to mention they were already really late. She gave me my food without much said and left quickly. My food was drenched in soup from a broken container, my ice cream melted, and my food cold. I tried to eat what I could salvage, but the food is terrible to boot."}
{"text":"This is an amazing little place with employees who do a good job and are welcoming. The food is delicious and the menu has a lot of variety to offer."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to using a coupon we had for this restaurant since my hubby and I both love Thai food.   We arrived kind of late but still early enough that they should have had a dinner crowd on a Saturday night. It was practically deserted. I tried to keep an open mind about it, thinking maybe it was a diamond in the rough.   The place itself is small, dirty, and not at all well-maintained. The bathroom was actually scary and dark.  The water tasted kind of yucky so I got a smoothie which is the only reason they are getting 3 stars instead of 2. The smoothie was delish.  We ordered 2 dishes, one spicy curry dish and one mild chicken pad Thai. The spicy was not really spicy at all and the chicken pad Thai had rather old peanuts in it which were gummy in texture.   The waiter was very nice and prompt, but was lacking a bit in the hygiene department.   We would not eat there again."}
{"text":"Was here some weeks ago on a Living Social deal. Very impressed with flavors. Thai Ice Tea was different and quite tasty! Being a BIG fan of Asian cuisine, this was a plus!  I purchased more desls from living social for both locations."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough, Papaya Thai is good eating. Whether using a groupon or a new experience, the food is good, the staff humble, and the fish tanks enjoyable almost as much as the tv's. We've been here several times, and have never had a bad experience. We hope you enjoy it here as much as we do...."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin with this place. I ordered delivery from them due to their review on Yelp and on Grubhub. They were 45 minutes late bringing the food then when I called to ask where it was the delivery driver said he would turn back around because he was taking the food back to the restaurant because he \"couldn't find my apartment.\" No phone call no nothing. Then when I finally got my food it was disgusting. The shrimp spring rolls were falling apart and had 0 flavor. Then the entree tasted like spoiled lemon. I will not be eating here again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been going to Papaya Thai in Mesa for a while now. The ambiance is not all that great, but the food is excellent. Usually I get it delivered. My son loves it!"}
{"text":"Chicken pad Thai is some of the best I've ever had! The portions are enormous and are enough to split between 2-3ppl! Service inside the restaurant is great and the people are very friendly. I've had two bad experiences with delivery, so I'll stick to pick up since the food is outstanding.  *Favorites: 4 chicken Pad Thai & Garlic Chicken"}
{"text":"Love this place. I can't believe it only has 2 1/2 stars. I have had Papaya Thai delivered to me probably 20 times. It's perfect and delicious every time. Maybe the 2 1/2 stars are from dine-in customers? I have dined in twice and found the fish tanks unappetizing. Anyway, I first came to Papaya Thai after Phoenix Magazine named their Chicken Mango Curry the best in the valley. It still is the best!  Their Drunken Noodles is my second favorite dish, and I also love their Authentic Traditional Phad Thai, Blue Sapphire entree, and Vegetable Fried Rice. All amazing! And to top it off, they have the best homemade coconut ice cream. I am not usually an ice cream person, but I never miss getting this ice cream. THE BEST."}
{"text":"So sad we chose this for dinner. It was the third strike, should have known better, shame on us. Ugh, where to start, my better 2/3'rds wanted curry, we opted to try something different and went with pineapple beef curry. Spice level he wanted low, so we went with a level that was supposed to be a two. It was a twelve. The only flavor we could get from it was heat and we love and can tolerate heat but this was supposed to be a two, if there was no heat however, there would have been zero flavor so angry butthole it is. It was full and over populated with onions, never had this in description on menu and he hates onions, we literally got out a strainer and strained the curry sauce over the under-cooked rice so my poor love could at least not whither away. The beef, well, wheres the beef? There was supposed to be some beef, there was two small corn flakes of beef. At this point I wish we had just done Corn Flakes and milk for dinner because it would have been better, waaaaay better and more flavorful. He ate two tablespoons of curry and made a darn frozen dinner from freezer, that bad. The spring rolls, oh the spring rolls, there was no dignity nor pride in manufacturing theses monstrosities that were wrapped looser than a two buck whore. Absolutely terrible. Even the peanut sauce sucked and lacked flavor. I actually asked for fish sauce instead as a substitute but they apparently don't listen so horrible prideless peanut sauce it was.   Oh for the grand finale of this horrible, tasteless, lackluster dinner....picking up the order. Gosh, I walk in, there is five other individuals waiting for their orders to deliver. Yes, Door Dash, Grub Hub, Uber Eats etc...you get the picture. They are all pissed because they had been standing/waiting there so long to deliver completed meals that were just chilling, yeah, getting cold on one of the tables waiting to be handed over so they could be delivered for over twenty minutes. Sorry to the ones that had to endure the wait (and the poor delivery drivers), sorry to the ones that may or may not have ingested this poor excuse of Thai and Viet food, it sucks :("}
{"text":"This place is my neighborhood go to for Thai. I've always enjoyed the dinner food over several years, both in restaurant and delivery. I tried their mango smoothie for the first time the other day and I found a new favorite place for those now too. Yay!"}
{"text":"Every thing was FRESH! The crab wontons were the MOST delicious I've ever had! There wasn't any crab in them either, which is great cuz I hate crab! Janet the hostess was so nice and quick!"}
{"text":"Well, I would like to be polite for a small business but this one needs help.  We went there and were the only ones in the restaurant initially, the staff was a bit cold and not too friendly but not too rude either.  We felt that we were imposing.  The family has a couch area for them to chill out on when the place is empty.  Cleanliness or lack there of. The kitchen does not have a door, it has a shower curtain or fabric type door.  This is a great area for bacteria from days before as it can come in contact with your food to hide.  I was not brave enough to peek into the kitchen as i did not want the food i was trying my best to keep down to come back up.  The floors were sticky, the bathroom smelt like someone dropped a \"Cleveland Steamer\" in.  The bathrooms were being used to store a table in the urinal area and stack unused chairs not to mention napkins instead of paper towels.  Overall you can pick this place apart, but even the simple things were looked over by the owners. If you are not too busy, you should be busy cleaning if someone arrives.   We drove from quite a ways and thought it would be a great change.  The bill came to about $50.  With the great deal groupon brought I felt it was not a value at all and a waste of time.  The food; The drinks were sparse and food were lacking in quality. The chef brought my plate out- nice touch but it was not that great.   I could deal with a rude staff if what you brought to the table was worth the trip.  It was not.  Food came out in waves the first person received theirs about 10 minutes before everyone else.  We added chicken to the entree and it had a whopping 4 slivers of meat that I had to hunt down for the up charge.  I my pad tai chicken tasted more of a ketchup/barbeque base and i have no clue where that came from.  The others ordered curry dishes and they had mentioned that they were ok at best..  I went home and I complained of stomach pains and gas.  When we woke up the next morning my brother in law was complained of similar discomfort the next day at 3 pm.  It is really the gift that keeps on giving.  I;ve been to restaurants i did not care to revisit and chose not to review at all, this one topped them all.  I am glad to see they have some good reviews from others, maybe try what you were doing when you were serving those people.  It must have worked but I did not see it.  Tips for the business: Clean the heck out of the business, top to bottom, wall to wall. Hire a professional.  Bad aroma is the first thing people taste. Remove the bacteria curtain, its fowl. Make the staff more friendly and conversational- not cold. They can be suggestive to people that have never visited.   Sample items leaving the kitchen to stay on top of your game in cooking.  I have been to quite a few tai restaurants and will not name names on this review. one in mind has all these items.  I will drive to Scottsdale in the future and pay the same for the higher quality and better experience."}
{"text":"This place is hard to review. On one hand they have some of the very best Thai food in Mesa. Easy 5 stars right? Well, no. They also have some of the worst service, delivery, and a few of the rudest staff I've had to deal with in a while. 4 out of the last 5 times that I have eaten Papaya Thai I had an awful experience with their service. Really too much to explain, and I hate overly bitchy reviews, so just know that if  you go here the service may get on your nerves. Otherwise the food really is amazing, only once has it been sub-par and that was after waiting almost 3 hours for delivery. It's a love/hate thing here, but good God I do love their curry. No matter how annoying the service gets, I still keep coming back so that really does say something. Good luck."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai food and order it all the time. I've been to Thailand and tried almost ever single Thai dish there is. For the first time ever I've come across the restaurant with the most flavorless dishes ever. We got a delivery and My Thai noodles were over cooked, with no sauce and 3 pieces of chicken. My boyfriend's pad thai was so sad looking (again with 2-3 pieces of. Small chicken) that after 2 bites I just decided to make my own sauces for both the noddles and pad Thai. There are many amazing Thai restaurants in both Tempe and Mesa - stay away from this one."}
{"text":"Food is okay but nothing special, the service is slow and when I tried to order a take out order with my groupon when I got in they slapped on extra fees when I got there before they would give me my food. I have eaten there once for take out and once eating in. The atmosphere is dirty and has the feeling that it needs a good cleaning but nobody wants to do it."}
{"text":"Okay, so this place is really hard to review. They do have great food. However, the service is a step below. We continue going back because the food is so good. It's just too bad really. Someone noted that if you check in on Facebook you will get a free Chai Tea. Not true. The Mango Chicken Curry is super. Tried something new tonite. Definitely something to try, but don't expect the greatest service ever. You will be dissapointed."}
{"text":"We only know this place by ordering from them at Grubhub.  We've been to a lot of Thai spots out here and I have consistently been disappointed by the fried rices.  Dry meat!  I'm so tired of dry chicken and dry pork whenever I order Thai fried rice at Thai joints. I expected the same here when I ordered and got a big cup of soda ready to chase it. . .  But no-- I was surprised by the juicy meat here.  Yummy, tasty fried rice, and an enjoyable experience with curries for the rest of my family too.  Intriguing.  I hope we can repeat this experience in the near future."}
{"text":"We love this place. Not the nicest inside, but the food is awesome! Seems to run a little hotter than most. We normally do a 4 of 5 on heat, but we do 3 here."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. My order was for take out and very simple. Mild yellow curry with chicken and an order of sweet sticky rice. The first problem encountered was when I went in. Music was blasting and no one was in the front. I waited three minutes before someone came out. Second problem, the curry was medium not mild which was too hot for me. The curry also had shrimp mixed in with the chicken and I did not want shrimp. There were hard vegetables in the curry, as if it had been sitting all day. The white rice was soggy. I couldn't eat any of it. The sweet sticky rice was not great but it wasnt horrible either. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here a dozen times or so and they only reasons I go back are proximity and Groupon. The Groupon says dine-in only, but they've always let me do take-out...until last week. I went into grab a quick lunch after a rough morning. I don't usually go that early so I didn't recognize little old lady but when I said I had a Groupon and wanted it to-go, she got really mad and started yelling \"no, you eat here\" and pointing to the '15% gratuity for large parties' on a menu. If I'd had the time I might've stayed, but instead I left and hit Burger King next door (not what I wanted).   The food is pretty good. I usually get the same thing: papaya salad, shrimp or chicken pad thai, and a random curry (massamun is my favorite but I try to mix it up). They gave me some free lemongrass soup once for making me wait and it was good to. I tried delivery once, but the guy got lost and it took way too long.  I'll go back to use up my Groupons but that will probably be it. It's a shame with this place so close but I guess I'll have to shop around. I would easily choose Thai Buffet but they closed and Pink Pepper is good but a drive."}
{"text":"This is my second review of Papaya Thai.  The first was brutal, I'd ordered Phad Thai, a personal favorite, and got a mush of cooked carrot and cilantro over noodles that were to the point of becoming paste.  I was really disappointed, as they are the only thai place remotely close to my house.  However, today I woke up feeling rather brave and hungry.  It's been several months, so I ventured back and ordered the same dish.  this time making sure to ask them to hold the carrots and cilantro.  And lo and behold, my dish was tasty.  It was sooo much better, I almost suspect it's under new management, or perhaps a different chef.  It's still not one of my top picks, but the service was good, the wait was short, and I was able to enjoy one of my favorite dishes without driving an hour to get it.    Overall, I'm both surprised and pleased by the difference.  Whatever changes they've made since my last visit were definitely for the best, and if they're permanent, I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Papaya Thai is the best Thai restaurant in Mesa. Can be hit and miss with the service if they're overly busy but the food is healthy and very good."}
{"text":"I love this place , food is amazingly authentic. Their menu is very varied, they have a Thai and a Vietnamese menu so a little for every palate."}
{"text":"My new favorite take out !! Very good overall experience . Great tasting curry. The bomb!! I will definitely call again."}
{"text":"When here with my girlfriend after a long hard day running errands. Saw the yelp reviews and gave three-star place a gamble. We Went in anyways and looked pretty dirty and our table was a little disgusting. All of our food was warm or lukewarm.  It's like they don't even have proper equipment to heat it up. The chicken satay was good but warm. I had to duck which was decently hot but not that great because it had bones in it. My girlfriends was the pepper steak and it was room temperature the first time and then we requested the waitress to appreciate it and then it came back with less meat and slightly warmer than before. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because we were comped 20% from the Waitress after telling her about it. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight upon recommendation from a friend. This place looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but is actually quite large on the inside.  Upon arrival we were seated immediately by a slightly dirty guy (his hygiene did need some work). The place seemed very empty for a Friday night. The decor here is pretty run down and dingy. It seemed like they had a nicer section that was blocked off by curtains. Maybe they should use this as the main dining room. The lighting was VERY bright at our table. A little dimmer lighting would be much better.   Overall, however, our food was delicious. The service was rather quick and we enjoyed kind of having the place to ourselves.   Will definitely be back in the future but maybe just for takeout. They also deliver!!!"}
{"text":"I used eat24.com to order and i guess they don't care about complaints.  The potatoes in my yellow curry were still raw and inedible, The curry sauce it's self was as thin as water.  There were stems still attached to the mint leaves in the spring rolls, not to mention the noodles inside the spring roll had some burned and crispy ends.  I ordered my food at 5:47pm on 2/20/2016, I can only surmise  that the kitchen staff that prepared my meal do not care about their job.  Nor do i expect that they have any care as to wash themselves properly between  bathroom and food prep."}
{"text":"I would give them a 4 but this is why I can't , the food is very good, service very bad, food is inconsistent, and meals that have basil come without, u ask why, they say cuz we ran out.   I got a rubber band in my soup and they didn't apologize,  I ordered smoothie with boba, but didnt get boba, the waiter said I am such a dope its my fault over and over. i was like Im reading my book  it is fine, I thought that was cool of me LOL   the food can be a 5 but mostly it is  a 3,  the owner is weird and mean, Once she left and my daughter and I had to wait for over 1/2 an hou to pay cuz I didn't have cash to just leave it, nobody would have known, but I would have. I asked if hey had desert cuz my 7 year old was getting restless they said no,, then came back said coconut ice cream I said sure.  they charged 4.50 for it, so I didn't tip when I finally could pay the check she told me  you never tip! ha ha ha. I tip when there is a reason , this is the first time I  didn't tip, because they got there tip from  the ice cream I didn't want.  I will go back cuz the food is good. its close to home, but I don't let them deliever anymore, I don't want psycho owner showing up at my home again.  I got 2 groupons, now that will be fun to use.  12 for 24 . no worries. eat here if u don't mind  maybe getting the dish u order to come out the same as the last time.  I am glad I am light hearted about it. I do order from better places mostly due to different reciepes."}
{"text":"I'm not saying the food is bad, I just never received it. Who ever is manning online orders didn't see the order for two hours. So I'm not giving them this low score for the food, I'm giving them the low score because they didn't pay attention. I was starving waiting for two hours for an order that was never started. I think that is total bull crap. They asked me if I wanted to the order still and it would take 60 minutes for the order, They were basically telling me that I have to wait three hours for my food.  They also said they'd make it up to me if I ordered again. How do I know someone will see it this time. I'm probably not going to order from their again. I wound up getting Jimmy Johns, that took 10 minutes from when i submitted my order."}
{"text":"Ordered food and delivered to my home via Grub Hub. My second time. I ordered yellow curry with chicken and massaman curry with beef. Also, I ordered spring rolls with shrimp. The latter was excellent but the curry dishes may as well have been vegetarian. Lots of liquid and veggies. The chicken was sparse and the beef, what there was of it, had gristle.  That's not good. Chicken and beef dishes should actually contain those ingredients especially since I paid for that.   I'm afraid I won't order again. Shame because I really liked having a Thai option for delivery."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing it on the basis of take-out.  I love their yellow curry.  I've actually only ever ordered take-out, but have ordered 5 or 6 times now.  Every once in a while I get a hankering for it and have yet to be disappointed.    I can agree with the other reviews that the decor is not the fanciest...it could use some updating.  In fact, I probably would not take my wife here to try Thai for her first time, simply because experience is important.  However, the food is good and that's what keeps me coming back.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"VERY DIRTY ALONG WITH MEDIOCRE, AT BEST, THAI/VIETNAMESE FOOD!  Wondering how many health code violations they have????  I brought my daughter and 4 of her friends in for dinner. Upon arrival, the waiter seemed rather frustrated, even though we were the only ones in there besides the guy who was paying. He sat us at a table for six but the table felt tacky, sticky and dirty. I asked him to clean the table and he acted a bit put out by that but came by with a bottle of Windex and a napkin, handed me my napkin and fork and started spraying. The girls had to snatch up their forks before he got Windex on their utensils!  He said the table was dirty because it is where they usually set the \"to go\" orders. Ok that is just gross and I ask, \"is that a good excuse for a dirty table?   Then  the waiter took our drink orders and brought us water. Each glass had just a couple of cubes, and a lime (which was nice and fresh) but the water looked cloudy or else the glasses were dirty, not sure which.   After we ordered I went to the ladies room and that place was filthy.  I was wearing a pair of slip on, canvas type shoes and I walked in and went to lift my foot and the floor was so sticky and dirty my shoe came off my foot!!  DISGUSTING!  Also, on the way to the restrooms there is an entry to the kitchen which is covered by a really dirty kitchen. I don't even want to think about what they are hiding behind that curtain!!  I won't even talk about what we ordered because it was all mediocre at best and not worth mentioning. Such a disappointment because several years ago we ate there frequently and it was quite good and appeared to be clean. We won't be back. PS Should fish tanks be that dirty?? Just ask'n!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hole in the wall so don't come here for the decor.   The service is also on the slower side but the food is good, cheap (plus regular coupons in the mail) and the portions almost always leave us with left overs. I prefer the curry at Mint Thai down the road but have no complaints with the other dishes. We've only had one issue with a dish being made wrong and they were happy to remake it right away.   They're also good for To Go food if you'd like to skip the decor and service."}
{"text":"Going in with bronchitis and coming out feeling like a million bucks?! I'm sold!  The rare beef + Tendon phò was phenom! The pho base is really outta this world! I enjoyed every last sip! Shoulda probably got some more soup for tonight!  We also bought the Pad Thai, and again, pretty darn good! I'm used to more egg and some lime, but that's just a personal thing. Next time, I'll try a \"2\" on the heat scale.We'll beh back for phò brah!"}
{"text":"The food is not great tasting and as gross as this sounds it had me running for the bathroom lol. All it takes is one bout of stomach issues from food for me to never want to try it again. Pass."}
