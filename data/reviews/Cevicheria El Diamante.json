{"text":"Food is really good but wouldn't recommend on take out orders for they're smaller portions than dining in"}
{"text":"Great seafood place with a great service! I usually don't write reviews but this place is great. They have a wide variety of seafood and also have live music. Need to come and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Great place no complaints. Im leaving a star just for the next visit.  The taco gobernador is really good. Fish ceviche and shrimp super fresh and the tostada is piled high.  Shrimp cocktail could use just a bit more flavor to the base. The place is nice and cheery friendly service. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I went to try this place because I was craving sea food. It is not for kids if they don't eat any sea food at all. The only dish you can order for them is empanadas, if they even like that. My waiter got all of our order confused, he didn't bring what I ordered but he did try to charge us. He did take it off the bill thou after we told him. Other than all this food is actually good, a little pricey thou."}
{"text":"I loveeeeee it here! I had the michelada and Baja shrimp tacos, highly recommend! Amazing service as well!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious with friendly staff. Most things are spicy so pay attention to the menu if you can't handle the heat. I go to this place a few times a week. It is that good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far,  shrimp and octopus cocktail was amazing!! It hit the spot, their aguas frescas are really well made! I can't recomend this place enough, IT DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"The food was very delicious. my husband and I loved it. I got the tostada mixta and it was the best one I've had in a long time so good."}
{"text":"Service with a smile, helpful servers and wonderful food. Well worth a visit and we WILL be going back again"}
{"text":"Came in via a Yelp review and very very upset the waiter gave us salsa that is made with peanuts!! I have a severe allergy , when asked why didn't they mention that... the waiter seemed to not be concerned and down play it ,, said he has the same thing so then WHY would you not tell someone!! I'm not happy!!"}
{"text":"Service was good the food not at all my Vuelve a la vida tasted like dirty fish water. I gone to so many seafood places but i had never taste this flavor. Seafood was not super fresh not sure if its because the seafood store doesn't open usually Sunday. Don't really recommend this place. I wasted 50 for nothing. Next time i will listen to bf go to dollar menu cheaper and at least it taste good. Sorry Cevicheria use the shrimp to make ur broth not the oystiones water"}
{"text":"Ok, so this is my new favorite restaurant! Everything was so delicious and the place is new and clean and friendly. I can't wait to try everything on the menu!! Thanks Mario you will be so successfulPS and even the water is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great mexican seafood. Very clean and friendly service. Bring an extra shirt!! Molcajete is tasty tasty but bring a shirt :)"}
{"text":"First time here, SOOOOO good! Shrimp ceviche was on point, tacos de asada was really good! Coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh seafood , fast and friendly service, and clean! This is my seafood spot from now on!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Try out the marlin, Shrimp Cheese and bacon empanadas as starter enjoy along with a Michelada and or a mojito to enjoy your food!!!"}
{"text":"If work sends me to the east side for the day, there's a better than 90% chance I'm going to Cevicheria El Diamante for lunch. Though the various namesake ceviches are solid, their food is just really good in general with super-fresh seafood, several spicy sauces, and a great attention to detail and plating.  Their seafood tacos are bomb. The Baja fish tacos are battered on double-layer corn with a light sauce inside and a spicier sauce used on the plate. Their $6 shrimp gobernador tacos are probably my favorite, with several shrimp, a spicy sauce, and Oaxaca cheese but the Marlin is also great, with a similar preparation but not easy to find in Vegas. Makes me wish I could go to San Diego more regularly, but this spot is good when a craving hits.  The tostadas are my preferred way to get their ceviches, mostly because the portions are huge and I'm usually dining solo. If you just want a little something extra on the side, or to take home, they have a few different fresh empanadas- the shrimp/chorizo being my favorite, but the green sauce they're served with is too spicy for me.   The servers I've had are polite but they often seem understaffed. They get busy in the evenings and only have one or two servers for a full house, and tables often go uncleared for quite a long time because staff are busy tending to customers. The kitchen also seems to get backed up easily, but as long as you go in aware and the food keeps coming out great, it's not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Great place for seafood dishes my favorites marlin empanadas and oysters PELIROJO style. Service was great Tania was amazing and very nice also Mario the manager came to the table a few times to check on us, this is now my favorite place to get fresh seafood everything was delicious definitely I will come back very soon."}
{"text":"Clean- hip- great customer service!   I loved this place!   Tostada sample platter was tasty. My favorite was the crab tostado.  The fish taco was absolutely amazing. My favorite dish was the Costeños. Great flavor. The mix with the avocado and cucumber was delicious and mouth watering.  Will be running back for more!"}
{"text":"WOW...We love this new place and feel we have found something special. We had the 7 seas Ceviche and fish tacos. Both items were amazing. We will be going back to try more items on their menu. Everything looked good. We did not order drinks, but we were surprised when an oversized Margarita glass, filled with ice,orange flavor and an upside down bottle of soda water---oranges and lemons garnish, rim dipped with chile-lime salt, was brought to our table-complimentary.  Can't wait too go back, we wish them well and hope they are successful. Fast service, great food, and a good time."}
{"text":"service was excellent except the food was horrible ,The one star is for the service other than that i will probably not come back. im not coming here only for the service main reason is the food"}
{"text":"One of the best seafood places in Las Vegas, if you are looking for truly Mexican flavors with a great service, don't hesitate in come to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent ceviche. Did one order of mixed ceviche. 22 and some change total.  Not cheap but stuffed two people with some of best ceviche we have had and wife was born in Guatemala.   If you want super fresh ceviche with a crisp citrus jalapeno bite go for it.  Served traditional style with ketchup and mayonnaise on side."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, DON'T come to this location! Go to the Charleston one. There was a hair in my food, a piece of avocado peel in my friend's and the ceviche was just too salty to eat. Our waitress was nice, that is the only good thing I can say about this place."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service! Provides both comfortable indoor and outdoor seating. There was a Dj and music going on when I was here and it really added to the overall dining experience. I can't wait to try out all of their menu options, because despite  \"ceviches being their specialty\", they also have a range of chef recommendations like the molcajete carnes (Chicken, Arrachera steak, sausage, nopales, onions, cheese, banana peppers, and Serrano peppers) right down to Oysters Rockefeller! We definitely loved their shrimp, cheese, and chorizo empanadas on top of enjoying their 7 seas ceviche (boiled shrimp, fish, octopus, crab, abalone, scallops, tomato, onion, cilantro, avocado, cucumber, and Serrano pepper). My friends and I will definitely come back with Michelada-tamarindos in hand!! (^_^)"}
{"text":"WHOLY MOLY!!!! This place is GOOOOOD!!! Such a cool little spot with amazing, fresh Mexican seafood. I had a layover in Vegas and decided to check this place out and I'm telling ya... I'm so glad I did! I will definitely be back. I am a MICHELADA AFFICIONADO and this is THE BEST Miche I've EVER had. The shrimp ceviche tostadas and the shrimp empanada (not pictured because I scarfed it down) was very tasty. They served it with a very tasty jalapeño salsa that was very spicy but fresh and flavorful. They play my favorite Mexican jams like Café Tacuba and Mala Vecindad. I was sold! So glad I decided to venture out and try something new! This is a hidden gem everyone should try!"}
{"text":"Este restaurante es una mala broma, llame para poner una orden por teléfono y después ir por ella, nadie me contesto, decidí ir en persona al entrar yo entro otra pareja una mesa ya se iba y otra estaban comiendo. Le dije a la mujer que estaba atendiendo que nadie contestó el teléfono, ella dijo estar muy ocupada me imagino que si con dos mesas. Ordene unos camarones a la diabla lo cual vienen con arroz frijoles y ensalada, una agua se Jamaica. Fueron un poco más de $23 dólares lo cual me parece un poco alto el precio, al recibir mi orden le di una pequeña propina y me fui antes de llegar a mi carro prove el agua de jamaica y savia mal regrese y la devolví. Pedí una horchata , al irme le tome sabía a jabón o algo con perfume, ya no quise regresar, al llagar a mi casa faltaba la ensalada y el agua de horchata era un asco! Llame y la mujer que me atendió pregunto que si quería regresar! Obvio que jamás regresaré la muy descarada se puso grosera  le dije que hablaría con el supervisor pero resulta que dice que es ella, le dije que debería verificar las órdenes antes de entregarlas y me dijo que todos comenten errores y que ni yo soy perfecta y me colgó la llamada ! Con mi visita de hoy era la 4ta vez en una o Ivón nos sirvieron camarones echados a perder, pero aún así pienso que la comida está buena en las otras ocaciones había bastante gente hoy es sábado y está muerto pues ya se por que ! Que mala experiencia lastima que empiecen tan bien y acaben tan mal !"}
{"text":"Very welcoming and helpful staff. Lively and cool decor inside with some Latin beats playing. Some nights they have also mariachi live bands.  We perused the extensive menu an we decided to start with a few options and share: tostado platter which comes with tuna ceviche, shrimp ceviche, crab ceviche, shrimp aquachile, the shrimp cheese and chorizo empanadas and the fish tacos.   The variety was good, fish tacos 5/5, empanadas 4/5 and of the ceviche selections we enjoyed the tuna, crab and large shrimp the best, overall 4/5.  Thank you for a good filling lunch."}
{"text":"I come here all the time after a long day of work. Service is great and fast. Best place to have a drink. Food is bomb......"}
{"text":"This was such an amazing experience. Everything is made in house and so incredibly fresh and flavorful. I had the salmon that came with a delicious salad. The salmon was some of the best I have had, and I am from Seattle so I know quality salmon. My husband had the garlic shrimp that came with salad, rice, beans and homemade tortillas. My husband could not stop raving about it.  To top it off, our server was friendly and attentive. We will be back again soon. I am afraid, I will be craving the salmon before I know it. The food and the staff truly made this a must return destination."}
{"text":"Great service and really good food loved the molcajete and you should try michelada really friendly employee"}
{"text":"First of all ask for Javier to be your server! He's very attentive and knows the menu and drinks very well!!  I found this place on Instagram and had to come try it for myself. The Michelada's were to die for! The sangria tasted like a sangria I've never had before, also amazing. I had the Baja fish tacos which were so delicious and unfortunately I can't remember what my friends ordered but they loved it. We also ordered a dozen oysters, I like putting horseradish and cocktail sauce on mine but they didn't have it so I didn't have an oyster. The food overall is the freshest seafood I've ever had. Me and my friends will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've tried around 10 Mexican seafood places in town. This hands down is the most authentic tasting of all. Excellent service and excellent food."}
{"text":"This is honestly my favorite ceviche spot right now. There fish ceviche is really good. There preparadas are given to you in mason jars and are really tasty. It's very clean and we'll maintain good place for lunch."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, Great Micheladas and taco fish So bad they use the same oil to fry fish & shrimp for those who are allergic to shellfish. Delicious Tostadas (fish) Nice music and very very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg the best seafood in town, hands down! The ceviche is amazing!!! Service is super friendly, place is always clean. Preparadas are amazing!!!!! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great service!! From our server Dayami, Fresh seafood! Decent prices.. definitely will return!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I wanted to try so many other dishes but the servings are a good hefty size and we only had room for 3 dishes.  Will have to come back to try some of the other dishes soon, very soon! We started with the Marlin Empanadas. They were the right size and cooked just right with a special sauce on top to add a little flavor but not drown them.  We then had the shrimp tacos which, i though if I have had one ,I've had them all. Not this time! They were cooked just right and the crip fresh cabbage and salsa made the taco just right! Last, but not least because I could not stop eating it. The Ceviche Casero is all the right Ingredients that make you forget you are a restaurant and picture yourself enjoying ceviche with your family on a holiday when you sit at home and can't stop eating your mommas deliciousness!  This place is for sure a must try when it comes to Mexican Cevicheria! Awesomeness! Do yourself a favor and visit soon!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos were so delicious!  Loved the red cabbage and the potion size was fantastic!  Shrimp ceviche was refreshing, although, I would have given a 5 Star if the shrimp was deveined and cut into small pieces.    The chips were prepared differently then I've ever tasted.  They were well seasoned.  Friendly service and nice clean seated areas for a date night.  Outdoor seating was quaint.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! On Point to the fullest! We went with friends and we each ordered something like our own buffet and I can see easily say every dish was AMAZING! Simply delicious with great service and its was very clean."}
{"text":"What great little place to enjoy Mexican style seafood and relax with a friend.   It's a cozy restaurant with vibrant décor. You can sit at either booths, raised stools & tables or a long communal table.  There are also a couple televisions, and best of all--no overwhelming fishy smell.   There were so many options on the menu it was hard to decide so we opted for the Sea Platter that had various ceviche, shrimp, octopus and oysters on the half shell.  It also came with a basket of tostadas and crackers for the ceviche. Although I've had better oysters, everything else was on point! And the portions were very generous.   I am certainly looking to go back or even pick up some take-out as there are so many items I'd love to try. So, it you enjoy seafood you should try it out."}
{"text":"This place is the best and I haven't even tried their ceviche yet!! We had a group of three for lunch and ordered the Mariscos Molcajate to share. The server (super nice guy!) recommended we try the empanadas while we wait and it was the best idea I've ever heard. The shrimp and cheese empanada tasted like the best donut you've never had. We also had one cheese and one chorizo with shrimp and cheese.  Didn't think we could top those appetizers but the Molcajate (my first ever) blew me away. The sauce was too good that you may just stick your whole arm in it. All the seafood was plump and tender.   The order total came to about $33 for the three of us. Highly reasonable for lunch. Bring your whole family here and try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food so fresh, I felt I was in Baja eating in Ensenada!      My first visit to Cevicheria El Diamante was really good, from service to food. Although a little pricey, you definitely pay for what you get, and that is fresh, great quality seafood here. It's Mariscos at its finest. Very clean new restaurant. The server was nice and friendly and explained the menu items so pleasantly. We shared 2 dozen oysters, a Ceviche, A Raw Shrimp Appetizer, and some Mojitos to wash it all down with. I do hope they stock more liquor soon though as when we dined in we only had one Mojito each because they ran out of Rum, and when we asked to make the change to Tequila and Cervesa they did not have Tequila either..."}
{"text":"Sea food is so fresh. They have a vast menu to pick from. Ask for what other drinks they have, a lot are not on the menu."}
{"text":"Wow this place is really delicious! I got the shrimp gobernador and it was amazing and packed with flavor! The cups of water are in glass mason jars and the place is so cute and looks newly renovated. They have 5 tvs for sports too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was my favorite spot until I found hard chunks of cement in my ceviche! Emailed with no response still!!"}
{"text":"Found a random place for dinner and found this amazing place! Great food and great friendly customer service! Loved the atmosphere and enjoyed the music while watching soccer.   We had the Shrimp Ceviche Oysters Empanadas  Crab ceviche tostada Shrimp ceviche tostada  Fish ceviche tostada  And a michelada and modelo   Everything was amazing! So cold and refreshing! How have I never heard of this place before. Please come try this place you'll fall in love too!! 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful little gem! This new kid on the block is here to offer seafood and drinks, mexican style. i saw the sign about a week ago saying \"Cevicheria\" and \"coming soon\". One week later I got to try a few of their offerings. Let me tell you, I'm DEFINITELY coming back for more! This spot is not too big with a modern and cozy feel. There are some booths, tables, and a communal table. As people start discovering this place, I can see seating becoming an issue. I got my food to-go and it smelled SOOO delicious I inhaled it while driving. That was definitely a balancing act, eating tacos and dipping them in side sauces while driving... So! I couldn't resist! Truthfully, I wasn't even hungry when I came in. I wanted to try the food before I bring my girls here for our monthly dinner. Now onto the food. I tried the chirozo, cheese, and shrimp empanada, shrimp taco, and marlin taco. All bomb! My favorite was the shrimp taco, big juicy shrimp, fresh and delicious flour tortilla. Tacos are wrapped in two tortillas, BAM! Double the deliciousness!!! I washed this amazingness down with a delicious tamarindo. You have cocktail options and can spike any drink on the menu.  Honestly, super yum! The prices are reflective of good seafood."}
{"text":"Yummy ceviche de pescado and fish tacos oysters and the food overall that we got was delicious and very good service I'm not from Las Vegas I'm from the IE and this restaurant was perfect !"}
{"text":"Just found un diamanté en the rough. This is a must stop for locals and tourists alike. The ceviche ranges from traditional to extreme. (I had the extreme tostada) not what I was expecting but more than I could have imagined. Don't leave Vegas with out trying this great seafood. Great food amazing service, I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"The menu is huge and has so many options if you're a seafood fan. I decided on the fish tacos and the shrimp, chorizo and cheese empanadas this go round. Everything was fresh tasting and super delicious. I highly recommend the shrimp, chorizo and cheese empanadas! I'll definitely be coming back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Had really high hopes for this place. It's nice looking and clean. The reviews are great. The service was outstanding!  Unfortunately the food fell short. Ultimately the food quality is the foundation. Their dishes are interesting, creative yet authentic but very vey overdone. Too much stuff and dressing and sauce on every dish we had. It was hard to taste the core ingredients. In a shrimp dish I want to taste the shrimp. An oyster dish should taste more like oysters than cheese and sauce. In some instances it was hard to actually find the main ingredient amongst and underneath all the unnecessary other  items. They were there and they weren't skimping, simply piling on too much other stuff.  That's it. Plenty of potential and an overall pleasant experience. I simply need to see and taste the food I order, not the condiments."}
{"text":"FOOD-Authentic Mexican food with good flavor. I recommend the Baja Shrimp Tacos. I believe it is slightly overpriced and the only bummer I experienced was stale chips that were served with the free salsa. Salsa was delicious though.    DRINKS-My friend wanted Michelada's to help with her hangover and I came across this place on yelp. Happy I did because they are amazing. Only $7 for regular Michelada when $10 or higher is standard in this city. Defiantly get one if you go.  SERVICE-Server was extremely nice and helpful. Happy, smiling and introduced us to their special.   PARKING-Lots of parking as it's in a shopping center.  ATMOSPHERE-Small, cute and clean. Outside seating available. I loved the Hispanic music playing while we ate.   DEALS-Check in on Yelp, Facebook or Instagram and get a free item. We received a free Modelo!"}
{"text":"This place pleasantly surprised me & I'm SO happy I checked it out.   I went all out & got 7 Seas ceveche..it had all the good stuff!   Once seated server brings out tostada style chips with salsa.   This place is not cheap but the fish is fresh & high quality.    The horchata is delicious!    Yummm"}
{"text":"Huge servings, fresh fish, excellent flavors.  Excellent Cevicheria.  The daily specials are a great way to sample the menu at really great prices. We love this place!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Cevicheria El Diamante and I very much enjoyed what I ordered. The fist tacos were fresh and flavorful and the empanada fantastic. I'm looking forward  to trying the ceviche next."}
{"text":"This was an awesome all around experience. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was nice, the restaurant had a trio of guitars play two complimentary songs for each table. Clean table and restrooms.   We had the pasta brava, the tostada extrema, empanadas, oysters, and some horchata that was delicious and very presentable. Great place to take someone for dinner."}
{"text":"Sunday Funday  Met one of my grade school friends last night at this cute little Mexican seafood restaurant for some much need catch up. We arrived to a mariachi band serenading a nearby table and it was pretty impressive to be honest. I enjoyed every minute of it!  Red Wine Sangria was served in cute mugs and taste amazing!  Beer battered shrimp tacos were pretty delicious nothing out of the ordinary stood out.  Cheese empanada was pretty good as well; nice and hot! Spanish Rice was surprisingly delicious as well; usually a hit or miss in my opinion.   I'm certain I'd be back to at least try the ceviche with mayo!"}
{"text":"This restaurant smelled like rotten egg. Food was mediocre but horchata was delicious. Waiters were friendly. I expected more authentic meals."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious and the service is amazing. I wish I could eat here everyday. I had a michelada and the the mix tostada. Very filling. They have a really great daily special menu. I came back today for the oyster special."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!  (Maybe dinner, too, but we had lunch.  Ample food, friendly guys, good atmosphere, decent prices.  The 3 of us loved the michelada - and 2 of us don't even like micheladas.   My ceviche could have been a little more citrusy but it was fine. The fish tacos were outstanding.  The price was right, too."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to try this place out because we were both craving seafood... and it was super close to home!   The hostess/waitress was very nice. The menu has an amazing selection of seafood that it was hard to decide. I finally chose the octopus tacos and my mom ordered the battered shrimp. Both were amazing! More food than we were expecting.   Overall I was very satisfied with my experience. The food and customer service was great and the decor is very well thought out and nice. Great place, I'll definitely come back and try some ceviche!"}
{"text":"I ordered a shrimp cocktail to go the girl (Tania) charged me $18 bucks for it I thought to myself it has to be really good cuz is expensive when I got home I dumped the cocktail into a different container and literally counted the shrimp ONLY 10 SHRIMPS in it!!!!! And it was flavorless they just threw like a whole cucumber in it to fill up the cup and barely any avocado..   Don't waste your money here server Tania had a bad attitude and that place has the letter B for a reason.  such a ripoff...."}
{"text":"El Diamante restaurant is fantastic! The food is delicious and prepared in an artistic way. Mario, the owner, is dedicated to excellence. The service is quick and the prices are reasonable. Stop by and grab a meal there!"}
{"text":"Food and service are good.   I was disappointed the fish tacos were mainly cabbage & sauce. The fish pieces were on the smaller side, but they were tasty.   The shrimp cocktail is delicious. Seeing the fish tacos, I though they'd skimp on portions, but it was filled with shrimp & very tasty.  I haven't tried their ceviche yet, but it looks good. It seems a bit pricey, but good seafood usually is."}
{"text":"Love the Food and Horchata from this place, they even serves my food exactly to my liking it is very appreciated when you get great customer service and food tastes great!  Will come back & highly recommend!!  Loved everything about this meal!!"}
