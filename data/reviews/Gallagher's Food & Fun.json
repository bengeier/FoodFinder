{"text":"Have gone here for over ten years. Great customers and good food. However,  constant changes in managers (seven in the last three years) barrtenders, and waitresses have convinced me to take my business elsewhere. Unfortunately, replacing the old with the new doesn't always work."}
{"text":"Horrible service and very unprofessional staff. Our waiter  (Harris ) very unorganized and slow. This place needs better servers who can get you what you want when you ask for it. We came in a large party and hardly ever seen our server. If you are looking for a place to go after work for drinks go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I cant give a zero or I would.   Had lunch there 10/12/16 with a co worker. We ordered different items from the menu but both consisted of chicken. We have both been sick with severe stomach pains and severe diarrhea 2 days now. How are we supposed to work running back and forth to the restroom.... stay in bed?  I called the manager Stacey, all she asked was do we need to go to the er? She thanked me and said she would look into it.  Look into what???  Something obviously caused us to be ill, we were fine and had nothing else before or after.   health dept perhaps?"}
{"text":"hey!  gallaghers food is good. the prices are fair. they have a nice menu with a variety of stuff. i don't know about the other gallaghers, but this one has offtrack betting.  it's a fun atmosphere and they put in numerous plasmas to spiffy the place up. the only draw-back to gallaghers, is the slow service. i don't know why it's slow. i've been here numerous times. the food is always good and no matter how busy or dead it is, they are just always slow. if you have time, it's a good place to go. if you're in a rush, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We always went here for drinks and food for about 4 years. Now so many new faces  the service is slow and I could hear employees complaining to one another. We gave it two chances we are done with Gallagher's. We had to walk out because our food took so long. We asked a gal there if we could get two beers, she gave us a go to he!! look like she didn't work there but yet she was being friendly to the other customers.   Hopefully we can find another place that serves great wings and amazing burgers. No More Gallagher's for us!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place with my family. 3 servers working the room and we sat there for 40 minutes without anyone approaching us. One server looked me right in the eye then turned and walked away. Maybe we were lucky, the people sitting behind us were served their food and a minute or so later got up and walked out leaving full plates. Being new in this area we've just found one place we will never go back to."}
{"text":"If I could not give this place a star, I would. We have come here a dozen or more times and each time is worse than the last. Today, we came in with a party of 6. We sat in a corner booth that was dirty, so we moved. We asked the gentleman to wipe it down and he made a rude remark about having to clean the table. We let it go and placed our drink order. When the drinks arrived, he forgot my daughters drink and the tea my boyfriend ordered had a lemon that he asked him not to put in it. So, we asked him to come over to the table. He proceeded to stand there and re-enact the drink order stating he didn't think she order anything and didn't recall he didn't want lemon. Once again, we let it go. We then waited 15 minutes for her drink. We placed our order and I ordered a hickory burger medium well. After 45 minutes our meal arrived. My burger was between raw and medium raw. By the time we got his attention, everyone else was almost done with their meal. He seemed very annoyed that I wouldn't eat my burger but did ask if I wanted something else. I said no, just take it off the bill please. He didn't even acknowledge me, just turned and walked away. Another 20 minutes passed and he finally checked on us. We asked for the bill and it took 15 minutes for him to bring us the bill. We entered our phone number on the receipt to use our points, which was $20 off our bill. We asked him to use the points, he said ok. Came back after 10 minutes and had run the entire bill on our bank card. We asked him to come by and he said oh man I forgot, people were talking to me....as he is walking away from us.  We are very good customers...all we ask is good service and good food. I can't imagine ever going back there again."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up for keeping it local, fun, and yummy! Service is always super. Food is always tasty. There are multiple screens and they will change the channel to accommodate requests. Love it here!"}
{"text":"I visited the Gallagher's restaurant located at 3220 E Baseline Rd. My party and I sat at the bar and had drinks while we waited for the food that we ordered, \"to go\".  While we sat there (approximately 5:00pm) a loud, drunk man was allowed to use the \"f word\" over-and-over, in every sentence, so loud that we couldn't enjoy our own conversation.  We received the food and I paid with Debit card. The bartender that just came on-shift; (long straggly hair with a nose ring) stated that my Debit card wasn't good. I explained that it was impossible. She instructed me to use the ATM machine (presumably to obtain cash). I became very concerned about my account so I used the ATM to run a balance. My [very large] balance was intact. When I told that bartender that there was plenty of money in the account to satisfy a $63 bill, She said that I might have just deposited that money, at that exact time, stating that the deposit I just made wouldn't be immediately available. I said, \"you seriously think I just made a deposit, right now, as we're sitting here??\" She said that no one else had problems with the charge machine, certainly not considering that it was she, as the user/operator, that was creating the problem.  This conversation was conducted in front of several people sitting within the bar area which, was unwarrantedly, very embarrassing, for her error.  We received our food (to go), left,  reached our destination and our food was horrible. I received 8, soggy waffle fries. Yet,  I ordered sweet potato fries. The other order received the sweet potato fries that she did order, all 11 fries.  The 10, teriyaki hot wings, grilled and baked, were rubbery and under-cooked, placed in a pool of sauce that tasted like  nothing more than liquid smoke.   Because of rush hour traffic we could not make it back to the restaurant just to deal with the woman that failed to help us in the first place.  You've raised your prices but your quality of food and service has plummeted. I want your management to know how unsatisfied we are and, will not be returning to that specific Gallagher's restaurant which, we used to faithfully frequent and enjoy many times over years of visits.  I hope this email reaches a Manager and I will also be forwarding this email to others via social media."}
{"text":"If wanna go to a place that the servers focus on cleaning tables rather than checking up on you and your obvious empty glasses that are sitting on the edge of the table, than this is the place to go. We have been here 3x and the same exact thing happens, every single time. Our servers are never around & when she is around she ignores the obvious empty cups. Then she walks to fast to catch her attention. Takes 10 minutes to bring us the drink even when the restaurant is extremely slow. (This is on top of the 20 minute wait until we finally got her attention to get another drink) then we ask for the check because by this time we are fed up with the 30 minute time frame it takes to get another drink. Of course they love to top it off by not giving us the check right away instead they insist on cleaning there tables yet again, while we sit there unsatisfied of our horrible service and they never EVER apologize. (\"She\" is every female server we have ever gotten the 3x we went) you would think for a bar they would keep up with the drinks but apparently cleaning and stocking tables is there main focus."}
{"text":"If I'm looking for a group of frowny faces from the staff, I know where to go. The bartender was rude and seemed to pay more attention to the people she knew and did more standing around then anything. Safe to say I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Yay!!!! It's good to walk into this place and see a familiar faces!! The other bar tenders suck! But Megan is the best!!!! She is friendly and knows her shit. Un like the other rude nasty bitches working here!!!"}
{"text":"We are regulars at Gallagher's, in fact we affectionately refer to it as Gally's. I hate to leave a bad review but something is not right.  Arrived at 7 pm on Friday night for fish fry. Waited a long time to place our order, then waited 50 minutes for food. Our waitress was Chelsea and she had no concern for us. My plate had BBQ sauce on the bottom (gross), didn't order anything with BBQ. Water w/lemon ordered but never arrived. Never offered beer refills. Never asked if we needed anything. Our plates arrived with the wrong sides, then we were told they were out of baked potatoes but not given the chance to pick a different side. We were given regular fries instead. A table next to us had dirty dishes sitting on it the entire time we were there. Another waitress snapped pics of the table. Given the wrong bill to pay, which at this point was comical. NEVER asked for our club card to add or redeem points.  All in all this was our worst experience. C'mon Gally's, get it together!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment three times so far. I go there for football Sundays, and it is just a mile and a half away from me. As far as the establishment goes, it is very clean, and there are booths everywhere for your comfort. They have a TON of televisions, and most are in Hi-Def. They have satellite with the ticket, and probably about 10-15 different receivers. It is dimly-lit, which is nice.  They have a few pool tables, and stuff for the kids as well. There is a spot for betting on the horse races (to which I know nothing about). The bathrooms are in fair condition.  The service, at least to my liking, is great. When I am there for 6 hours, I don't expect the waitress to be around every 5 minutes, but she will frequent every 10-15 minutes,  unless she is servicing another table or if you request something. Their attire is appropriate, with football jerseys and short jeans shorts. Pretty cute, yet appropriate if you ask me.  As far as the food goes, I am trying different things, but be prepared to eat. They give you a lot of food for the money (in most cases). If you get one of their skillets, go there hungry. The staple chips/salsa is okay. the chips are a little tough, not as salty,but they are freshly made (they come out hot) and the house salsa is pretty good. I liked it.  * I do want to add that they had a new chef in there, and the eggs on my skillet were under-cooked. I did send it back, but the top manager or establishment owner came out and personally apologized, and had a new dish out within 5 minutes. Mistakes happen, but they really came through and went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied.   I will be going there every Sunday through the end of the season. If you have never been, and you need a place to go, this is a good one!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!  I have a confession though... I'm a trivia addict.  So any restaurant or bar that has the Buzztime trivia automatically gets an extra start in my book... but for some reason this is where I like to play more than anywhere else.  I usually hang out in the bar/off track betting area, playing trivia and once in a while betting on the horses or dogs (with miserable results, I hate to add.)  One of my favorite sandwiches in the Valley is here - I love their Buffalo Chicken.  It's huge and covered in a pretty hot yet flavorful buffalo sauce. Unlike most places where it's not hot enough... oh and they let me choose the heat level.  Wings are really great here as well.  Now I'm wanting to get back over there for a beer, buffalo chicken and gave of trivia... Too bad it's only Thursday.    Cons: If you are a young single man looking to go out and meet someone, avoid this place at all costs. Also only a few microbrews, and not a lot of choice of beers on tap."}
{"text":"I love going there for their wings but they have a bartender named Teresa who is an absolute BITCH. She's rude, demanding n is plain nasty. I will never go there whenever she's there. She ruins the appetite!"}
{"text":"This place is normally pretty decent my favorite is always the fish fry friday! Hands down.. We have been going there numerous times.. Normally the price is 10.99 which is stated on there website As well as of TODAY 08/05/2016 yet was charged 11.99 oh well 1$ whoopty do.. I'm ok with that.. I'm not ok with the fact I arrived today with my family at 4.pm.. And wasn't eating until 5:09, and when asked for my 2nd plate of fish it did not arrive until 6:20. Granted again it's friday.. But that's no excuse when they know it will be a busy day.. I was completely dissatisfied and will not return with my family and will be sure to pass the news along to friends to stay away from this place.. Server was no help had an attitude and made it all that much more worse. Her name was chelsea. I am in customer service and know the importance that when things arnt going smootly that you need to make at least the customer feel at ease which did not happen..We Will never return.. And will gladly be disputing the transaction for sure since it was a costly one for the entire family of 6 to go to what we expected to enjoy and turned out to be a waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"Went there on 12 -5-14 to watch the U  of A vs Oregon game.  Service was horrible, had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks,  they only had 1 bartender on duty, great planning knowing that it's Friday night, big game on TV, horrible horrible experience."}
{"text":"I used to live down the street so I was at this joint constantly.  Especially for the Friday fish fry and the wings and the cherry coke and the wraps oh and the seasoned fries!  The service can be a bit slow but it never bothers me since I normally invest a couple of hours with friends.  Plus the servers are really friendly and remember you after only a few visits.  I must visit this place every time I visit otherwise I will regret it for days.  Try the wings and don't forget the cherry coke (which they make, not from the fountain)."}
{"text":"We have to agree with many of the other reviews, something has changed at Gallagher's recently.  We used to enjoy good food, good drinks, and good service in the years past, but during our last few visits inconsistencies are the norm.  Today our shrimp tacos and bacon (potato) skins were very good, but the teriyaki wings were severely overcooked and lacking sauce.  The beer was good and cold, but the cocktail that is usually served in a highball glass came in rocks glass.  Service was ok, but the staff seemed to disappear for extended durations at times.  We will give them another shot down the road, and we hope they can return to their prime before our next visit."}
{"text":"This is my local bar. I go here when I want to go somewhere to unwind. If you go on Saturday nights, Terri should be bar tending and she is a trip. She is a great bartender and a lot of fun to talk to."}
{"text":"I  wasn't sure t give it 3 or 4 stars. I settle on 3.  There is really nothing wrong with this place it just isn't my scene. The food is pretty good. There is nothing amazing about it but it's good.   Karaoked here 1 night for a friends birthday. It was fun.  I don't remember now what song I was looking for but they did not have it.   The people there are pretty relaxed and I've been here a few times and never seen it get too crazy.  I would say this is a good place to have a beer and eat some food but not the best place to just hang out and drink. According to me."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.. service is good, food is ok, but its the surroundings are interesting. Always smells funky in there.. like bratwurst and an sweatsock. Despite this i would return to watch a game or do some off track betting."}
{"text":"I only go there to watch NFL Football because its in the neighborhood. Good Chili and nachos, but the rest of the food I have there, was not good.   They also lack good service and a good manager."}
{"text":"I see so many 4 and 5 stars.  I have been going here off and on for about 7 years.  I say off and on because there always seems to be a problem with the staff, management (or lack thereof), service, food.....etc.  My recent issue is with the 27% price increase on the cost of shrimp (and I mean one per taco) tacos.  They used to be 1.25 but just two weeks ago they jumped to 1.59.  After writing management (really the owner) and receiving a reply back from a manager, it seems that they are not really willing to understand the problem.  Food is decent, staff is ok.  I will say that the owners' concern for his business is a negative 5!  Probably will boycott them for another 6+ months to see if things straighten themselves up.  Cheers"}
{"text":"I loved Gallaghers and especially Teri. Someone needs to give her a job pronto! She's the only one who knows how to split checks properly. They often had her as the only server for the entire restaurant even when manager wasn't on duty.  Whenever she wasn't there they had to replace her with two servers which proves she handles the job of at least two  people, often three She's amazing and fun. Only one star cuz they shut our favorite weekly spot down with no notice too. Sucks."}
{"text":"My hood bar. Love this place! The people and the staff are friendly and chatty. Fun place to hang out for a beer and watching the game."}
{"text":"You can bet on the ponies! Not to mention a variety of options offered on their menu. Our bartender/server took great care of us despite being very busy. I'll go back !"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Service can be slow depending on what time/day you go. OTB is the only reason my husband and I visit once in a while."}
{"text":"I love this spot. Been coming in for years. They serve their beer in frozen glass and it's always cold & delicious. I also love their Wing Wednesday deal. 79 cent wings and they have @6 flavors. Plus they give you choice of fried or grilled. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Prices are way too high after the wage increase. Goodbye  So as predicted it looks like our watering hole has closed. As per a neighbor. We went last week and paid 25 bucks for a few wings and iced tea. Killed by the wage increase. I wonder how many other small businesses will close. Thanks to all the staff we have gotten to know over the past 4 years. Our watering hole and lunch spot when I was drinking then not so much. Moving to sun city next month anyway. Will miss sliders and trivia and the good times. Good luck to the staff. It appears that at least for now the other 2 locations remain open"}
{"text":"Well, I don't get annoyed easily. Walked in for a place to watch the 2015 World Series & an absolutely awful band was playing loudly. There was no host to find us a seat, so we sat down ourselves. We waited 20min with no service. We decided to go to the bar. We were served quickly, however the bartender (Julie) was rude as hell. I will not be coming back. Terrible place."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night as a party of 6, the place was decently busy, a waitress told us to seat ourselves.... We then proceeded to sit there for literally 30 minutes and we were never acknowledged by anyone. I understand it was their Friday Night fish fry which is why we were content waiting a bit. But ultimately to be completely ignored, no one brought us water, no one told us they would be right with us, nothing, we got up and walked out. Very irritating, won't be returning."}
{"text":"Service is \"OK\". Last time we went in we ordered chicken wings. When we got them they were undercooked. Yes, we should have said something but we were so grossed out and weren't having the best service experience so we just paid our bill and went on our way."}
{"text":"I walked in this evening and was surprised at the lack of professionalism and negative attitude of the staff. I was literally ignored for over 15 minutes, not even acknowledged. The tote lady was equally as rude, and introduced herself as the resident *itch. I was genuinely offended and will never return."}
{"text":"Our visit to Gallagher's on Saturday, March 18 was absolutely horrible.  We come into this location every Saturday and have not had problems until that day.  We ordered potato skins;  came 25 minutes later, they were both cold and burned to a crisp.  We weren't able to get the attention of our server for both the skins and to get drink refills.  She hardly ever came around.  When she finally came back for our food order, it was pointless to complain.  When my food came, my home fries were also cold and greasy.  I did get her attention for this.  She returned them to the kitchen.  About 5 minutes passed and they were returned.  Literally, returned!  The same home fries refried and now absolutely dripping in grease.  I squeezed one of the home fries and we watched the oil drop.  Again when we told the waitress, very little concern.  We however, were very concerned.  We spend our hard earned money at this establishment and today we were treated like crap.  Unacceptable, especially is today's society of social media.  I have sent three different emails to this location with no response, apparently they do not care about customer service AT ALL!  I'm ashamed for Gallagher's!"}
{"text":"I would definitely not recommended this place to anyone..... poor service and food...."}
{"text":"I just moved to Peoria and am unsure where to find anything really. Gallagher's is just around the corner from my house, so my boyfriend and I have been inside to eat for lunch and also ordered take out several times. Their salads are kick ass and when you ask for anything extra, they come through! The worst is ordering takeout and finding items missing when you arrive home...but these guys never let it happen. My man loves hot sauce and their ghost pepper sauce (I think that's the name) literally almost gave him an ulcer. He decided to take it down a notch on our next order, but that was impressive. Love this place."}
{"text":"It would be nice if the cook knew how to read English so they could read the food order tickets... I ordered my pizza extremely well done so it was throughly cooked the way I like it... It comes out undercooked where it more or less a plate of pepperoni grease... This has happened on our last several visits here... Extremely disappointed... To make matters worse there were only 2 waitresses to a sports bar full of people... I absolutely hate waiting 20 minutes for my check... This place needs a lot of improvement before I come back... It used to be great 5 years ago..."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for a quick app and a beer because I heard it was better than Enoch's Lounge around the corner. We asked if it was okay to sit on the patio and was told that someone would be right out to help us. There were 4 or 5 regulars sitting at the bar. After sitting outside for five minutes I went back inside and took a menu off of one of the tables. After five more minutes without being helped I decided to head inside to put in our order, we were met on the patio by an employee coming out to smoke, and she told me to tell the bartender what we wanted because she \"wasn't on the clock.\" As I approached the bar, the bartender seemed annoyed that I was interrupting her chit chat with the regulars. When our combo platter came out I noticed it didn't have the marinara that the menu said it was served with. I asked for it and she told me that it doesn't come with it, but she could ask. Waited several minutes but decided to just eat without it. She never came back to check on us, so I went inside to pay the bill. Total was 17 and change, gave her a 20 and only got 2 dollars back.   Did not feel welcomed or appreciated...Never going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Gallagher's on a spontaneous date night we were both pleasantly surprised that the service was fantastic and the food was also good we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place used to be good but then something changed. There was one night when Tristan had the dining room full with regulars and Chelsea was in the shit pit over by the OTB. After that the service went down hill where they didn't have ribs on the day it was their special to a night where it felt like the bar tender didn't want to hand out drinks. The place went from awesome to us not wanting to return in a matter of weeks. We used to enjoy going there for the food and the great service by Chelsea and Tristan but Tristan is not there anymore and it's not worth wasting your time or money on people who don't want to do their job."}
{"text":"Food has slowly declined over the years. But we are loyal and patient we love the staff and atmosphere. We bring our kids on Tuesday they eat free.  Note to management don't serve the wine cold..."}
{"text":"good drinks but service a little slow getting your check once done. they hardly check back with you. they need to wipe down seats as well as the tables. common sense.   they call themselves a sports bar but never show the ufc fights.  disappointing."}
{"text":"Wings were amazing. Only issue is I went there to watch the AFC Championship game and the volume being down took away from the environment. But I never checked to see if they could raise the volume so I won't take away from them."}
{"text":"Food service is slow. 45 minutes for an order of sliders and potato salad. Only ten customers in here at the moment. Not a place to have lunch on a schedule!"}
{"text":"The nachos are the best nachos I've ever had!! The service is always slow but it's a fun place to be in because of all the TV's and horse races and people watching!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years. Unfortunately, the last couple of times I'v been there have been slowly getting worse when it comes to customer service.   The food is top notch, that's where the 3 stars come into play. Best boneless wings I've eaten. French dip is amazing. Food over all is great.  Where they are lacking is customer service. It seems if I am not at the bar right in the lady's face, I am forgotten about.   Example: I was in there just yesterday and sat at a booth, it was hot and I was hungry. Waitress came to me right away, A+. I asked for \"a water for now\" I guess she took that as I'm done. About 15 min of me sitting and reading (after I looked at the menu and decided what I was going to eat) a gentlemen walked in and sat at the booth behind me.....Ordered an Ice tea....She brought it right away.....Came back to him after tending to another table and asked what he would like to eat.   Because I was reading I had no idea how much time had actually passed....I had been sitting there for 43 min without being checked on. After the man had ordered his food and I was aware of the time, I grabbed my stuff and left, no one stopped me, no one even batted an eye.....I did not leave quietly.  Suggestion for future: When you, or any of your other server/cooks/bartenders/busers see a customer looking around for someone, understand that a restaurant works as a team and you should 1, inform someone, or 2, help them yourself. If you are working, maybe don't have family there visiting, as my server was sitting at a booth 2 seats behind me the majority of the time talking with a gentleman who had a young child with him.  I would give this place 1 star based off this horrific experience if the food wasn't so damn good."}
{"text":"DID IT AGAIN!   Love this place.   Today my wife and I wanted chilli dogs and came in and did not see on Menu.   We asked if they had any and told us they would be happy to make some even though not on Menu.     We got the chilli dogs and Awsome 2 wieners on each one and not the short ones!   Piled high and great taste.    The Manager is great he always comes bye to say hi!   The waitress was great!   Great iced tea also!    Keep it up!    And oh a month ago I forgot my debit card and left it there for a week, when I got back to pick it up they had it ready for me.     Thanks a Lot and I owe the waitress , I FORGOT sorry!"}
{"text":"We come here every year to watch the NFL games and enjoy good food. This year the service is not as good as it used to be. Service is slow. We had to ask for refills. Time to start looking for somewhere else to go"}
{"text":"Great food & drink specials!  Love watching the games here."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The staff is amazing the atmosphere is amazing and it's such a great place to just chill out have a couple drinks catch a game or a dog race, play some pool or shoot some darts. They have betting on the dog races too.  Me and my hubby went there the other day for my birthday and they give you a free shot!(or a cookie sundae) but I went for the shot haha.  We were able to play some pool have a few drinks and relax. The waitress was great they always are and the bartenders are always helpful and if you don't know what you want and tell them what you like they will make you a drink. Don't like it? That's alright! Oh and they have a rewards card! Even better!"}
{"text":"great chili and mac and cheese! nothing too special on the inside, really its just a bar, but the food is good!"}
{"text":"Best local bar. Everyday there is a special and Friday if u are creative you could get a free lunch. Fish is yummy. Salads are fresh. Terri is so fun. No bad days here. Like Stacy. She is a hard worker and very friendly. Consider this \"our place \".   Closed. Sad but true"}
{"text":"Went on recommendation of a friend, food was good, but service was very slow. I think they were short staffed.  Might give it another chance."}
{"text":"Terrible. Would have stayed but the person that was occupying the horse window was outright rude. That is after she got done with her cell phone.  They had trotters on the monitors and asked to place a bet, \"We don't do buggy's\". Understandable. Could you please change the monitor to one of the races you do accept bets on. Talk to you waitress. Waitress said it wasn't her problem what's on is on."}
{"text":"I just had the worst wings ever. The wings tasted like they were fried in 2 week oil gorilla oil. Yuk 10 wings for $11 dude come on!"}
