{"text":"Went there for burger fest. Had the $50 burger it was pretty good undercooked yet a bit dry. Would say this burger would be worth about $35 at most. The host was a little off asking us what we were there for? Like come on lol. Where here for drinks and some dinner. The place felt a bit snotty. Don't think I would return."}
{"text":"Delicious food, havarti fondue is to die for. Bison was tender and veggies very flavourable. Service is always really good.  Only criticism is that the tables are super close together, maybe a bit too cozy.  A nice treat for a night out."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to the Living Room? If you want a wonderful time, then I would highly recommend. Professional, experienced staff matched with great ambience, and excellent food makes the living room a complete experience. As a local Calgarian who has been around the block, I give five stars. At our lovely sever's advice (Chris is a gem) we enjoyed a beautiful board of charcuterie paired with a reasonably priced bottle of Barbera, followed by the chicken and dumplings (the stuffing is to die for), steak tartare (100 year old french recipe) and vanilla bean brulee. Try their signature drink, \"the shaft\" you will not be dussapointed."}
{"text":"This is a five star rating! You cannot go wrong. Everything about this place is top notch!"}
{"text":"To be precise, I would give this place 3.5 stars . It is definitely better than a 3 but not worth a 4 on my scale.   The Fondue was okay. Duck breast was good. Ambience was good. I liked their wine list. They have a good selection of old world red wines - my friends and I still talk about that bottle from Rhone Valley till this day..."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. I went to the Living Room for dinner last night and I still have some food left over for lunch today... How early is too early to eat it? Beef short rib at 7:00 am?   I have been wanting to try Living Room for a long time, so when a dinner voucher came up on Living Social, I was all over it. I kept forgetting I had the voucher, but I finally got to use it last night.   I went with my BF and we shared the feature appetizer; two pulled pork soft tacos and one halibut soft taco. BF ordered the feature prime rib, and I ordered the beef short rib. Everything was so tasty. Very rich flavours. The short rib is cooked sous vide and the meat just falls apart. The mashed potatoes with smoked gouda were awesome.   Our server was working really hard. The restaurant was not super busy when we arrived and we got lots of attention. Once the tables started filling up, we saw our server a bit less, but that was just fine. I think they could have used one extra server.   The weather was looking a bit gloomy last night and no one was on the patio. I would love to come back on a nice night and spend some time on the patio. It looks so cozy with the fireplaces!  Food and drinks came to around $120, so it was a good thing I had the $60 voucher. Living Room is not cheap, but the food quality is excellent and well worth the treat. Living Room is a great spot for a special date.   I will be back for the fondue and watermelon caprese salad!"}
{"text":"Incredible service, poor value. The food was quite good but its ridiculously expensive for its portions and quality."}
{"text":"Very rude! Felt uncomfortable, unwanted and insulted.   Went with a friend for drinks on a Saturday night around 10:30 pm. We were stopped at the door by the owner, who told us that they were having last call. I questioned this because it was a Saturday night and only 10:30 but turned to leave. My friend insisted that there was time for a drink, seeing the place was half full, so, the owner agreed to let us have a \"quick drink\". He then led  us to a table and took our order.   We then watched the owner meet an endless parade of other patrons at the door and lead them to their tables without saying a word about last call... All of the \"acceptable\" patrons appeared to be 20-somethings; blonde and skinny. We are two gals, who just turned 40. We were dressed nicely and not drunk. It was obvious that we were not wanted in this place solely because of our appearance.  My friend was in tears. Literally. She was so embarrassed and insulted it ruined her entire night.  The owner of this establishment is rude. He also has poor business skills. He showed us that us 40-something women are not wanted here. Perhaps we were not skinny enough, blonde enough, or our heels were not high enough. Who knows?  I will never again frequent this place. I will never recommend this place. There are plenty of restaurants and bars in Calgary where I feel welcomed and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"The Living Room has been around for as long as I've been gracing the sidewalks of 17th ave. A week ago, my friend and I decided to try out their patio since the Ship and Anchor was too busy.  I was meaning to try the Living Room for years, but there was always something else that seemed a little more appealing. I should have given it a chance a long time ago, because I had a fantastic experience here.  Our hostess was prompt and offered us a seat by the fireplace. The patio was luxurious. It is enclosed quite well so that the people from the streets aren't walking into your dinner.   We only ordered wine and shared a charcuterie board. Keep in mind, this review doesn't accurately refelct the whole menu since we only ordered one thing. But I will tell you about the charcuterie board. It was FANTASTIC. Well worth the $32. You know when you go to a restaurant and order cheese, and they give you a wedge about the size of your thumb? Not at the Living Room. The cheese portions were quite generous, there was a grand selection of cured meats, sausages, fish, pickled artichoke and cashews. Our server acknowledged the fact that there were so few crackers and offered to give us some complimentary bread. Everything was delicious. The two of us couldn't even finish a whole board and we were both on empty stomachs.  The Living Room knows what good service means. Our waters were filled constantly. Our server came to check up on us at appropriate times. He wasn't annoying, didn't linger too long, was confident and knew exactly how to make our experience a pleasant one.  I'll definitely want to come back again and try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Tuesday after work I met up with a long time friend for drinks and dinner. We decided on the Living Room because we wanted to go somewhere that he had not been. This was very difficult as he is in the food industry. I had been to the LR many many years ago and always remembered what a great time I had. So we went.  We arrived around 5:30 and I think we were the second people in the place. It actually never really filled up, Tuesday, but eventually they had about 1/2 a room full.  We both felt like wine so after cruising the massive, yummy wine list we decided on a glass of Luca, Shiraz. This is a wonderful full bodied meaty red. We decided it was time for an appy ordered the Foie Gras. My friend is a FG snob and loved it, I found it just a tad salty but good none the less. Now we need more wine so we ordered a bottle of St. Francis, Zinfandel. It's $70 a bottle but worth every orgasmic drop! By this time we needed another appy and ordered the Beef Tartare. They mix the tartare right in front of you so you can decide if you want everything in or pick and choose. We went all in and it was to die for!!!!  For the main course I had the pork chop, my friend had the duck and we were joined by this time by one more buddy and he had the ravioli. I could go on all day but everything we absolutely delicious. After we swapped bites back and forth I think we came to a unanimous decision that the ravioli was the most unique for flavors.   Naturally we had to have desert so we shared a lemon curd creme brulee with a glass of  Moscato. All I can say is. OMG!!!!!!! I think I've gone to heaven!!!!!  So to make a long story short, I love the Living Room. They have been in the same space for 12 years, and in Calgary that alone say something!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So incredibly disappointing! Save your money and find fondue elsewhere. Had heard great things from people in the past. Went for an xmas dinner with 8 other gals from work. We were there for 3 hours!! We waited 45 minutes for our main courses. Hardly ever saw our waitress. Probably because she was getting her auto gratuity due to our large party so she didn't give 2 sh*ts about us. Asked if dessert would take as long as the main course and we were assured it would be quicker. Wrong, half hour wait for chocolate fondue and when it finally came out, the chocolate was COLD and the consistency of water. There was also no way it was actually Callebaut chocolate based on how it tasted. We got it removed from our bill and didn't even eat it.   While getting our coats, I ran into the manager and very nicely let him know that our experience was very subpar. He spoke to me like I was just being a big b****. Told me that he they can only serve the chocolate fondue \"warm\", which would have been nice, but ours was COLD. And then proceeded to tell me that HE tasted our fondue and it was exactly how they always are. UNBELIEVABLE!!! Will NOT be returning, huge waste of money so a said \"classy\" establishment."}
{"text":"Had the 3 course tasting menu with wine pairings.  Fantastic food, great wine choices and excellent service.  A very nice evening."}
{"text":"Just finished their Big Taste lunch menu with 2 of my coworkers. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one of every thing on this limited menu. As far as the food goes, most of it was pretty good - the soup excellent, the flatbread lackluster, and everything else somewhere in between. Where they really lost points is service. A lunch reservation on a weekday during Big Taste shouldn't result in a 90 minute experience with lengthy waits between courses. There was only 1 server on, and I feel for her - but only the poorest of planning can be blamed for that. There wasn't even anyone on bar so she was truly flying solo."}
{"text":"As with any pricier restaurant you can always expect to spend money! What you don't always count on is a waiter or waitress that went out of his/her way to make your evening special! I forget his name but he was a younger guy, great sense of humor and really made my girlfriend and I feel special! The food was great, not outstanding, but great! Service was excellent! Will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"Yeah, went back, sitting at the rail and the bartender runs out of a French pinot to fill a glass for a customer in the dining room. So, of course you open another bottle and carry on, nope, the best way to handle this is grab an open Spanish tempranillo and pour the other half. Makes sense, doesn't it?   As always, the guys here have a formula that keeps the sheep coming back, but ZERO respect for the customer."}
{"text":"Back in the so-so 90s, my brother and I used to kill a lot of time (we were slackers, after all) at a place called the Living Room. It was a coffee bar on Broadway Ave in Saskatoon, which is about the hippest part of town. It had a good vibe, and wingback chairs much like you'd find in an actual living room. The service there was very good, as was the coffee. The staff and patrons were predominantly good-looking hipsters (as one would expect in the hipster district). The Living Room in Calgary, which bears similarities in name and some hipness factor to my old Saskatoon haunt is not a new business, but I'd been meaning to check it out for some time, partly due to personal nostalgia (see above), and also because I'd met one of its cooks at a party.  So I lined up a date with the ladyfriend (which is what I call the wife when we go out).   The room is dimly lit and not too small, with a cool bar. After we were seated at our high-side table for two, I chilled out with my usual pre-meal smash of bourbon on the rocks (Maker's Mark -- pretty heady stuff, somewhat overrated, but still very drinkable); followed promptly by the second barrel.  The waiter worked fast, and didn't hover.  He understood the judicious use of  eye-contact. He was very good. I had oysters to start (I always get oysters if they're available), which were cool to the touch and well presented. My fabulous date had a beet green salad which looked great and got the green thumbs up (she's a gardener). She wasn't drinking, so I only ordered a glass (instead of a bottle) of what turned out to be terrible zinfandel; after complaining to the waiter, he brought me a much more flavourful cab sauv. He was very good. For the main, we split the bison flank for two (on the \"interactive\" menu), with julienned spuds and vegetables.  This was an extra meaty dish, which I'm totally into. The waiter agreed.  He was very good.        Dessert was great, too, a refreshing lemon sorbet, which is all you really need, though there are a host of higher-calorie confections on the menu if you dig that. (I do, of course, but skipped it that night.) So the food was good and service very good (see above). Thumbs up to the busboy, too. On the downside, they charge a dollar for tap water, but it's cold and they bring it in a cool bottle.  And really, you should drink more water anyway, you'll feel better the next day, you slacker."}
{"text":"Rouge has competition in town.  The Living Room is a fantastic place for serious foodies. Party of four - we choose the chef's menu and paired it up with wine.  Waiters were wonderful and tended our every need. Food that came out for our multiple course meal was tastefully presented and the wine pairings matched the food perfectly.  It's on my 'to go again' list."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to check out The Living Room, so a friend and I planned to meet up there for drinks one night. Upon arriving and waiting up at the front to be seated, one of the staff asks us if we are staying for dinner and we said no, just for drinks. He then tells us that in that case he doesn't have any room for us and has the balls to suggest other places on 17th ave where we can go for drinks. WTF.  We were all dressed up and ready to drink, so we went down to Charcut, which turned out to be much more welcoming.  So, based on this insulting experience I give it one star."}
{"text":"Great wine selection!! The food is overpriced for the poor quality & small portions they serve....been here a few times to eat & the food is always a dissapointment!!"}
{"text":"Was exactly what we expected. We went on a Monday evening so it was as hectic as the weekend. We shared the charcuterie board. Had a great selection of meat, olives and a couple pieces of cheese. Was extremely quick coming out which was great. We also prefer the interactive lamb and carrots. The lamb was cooked to perfection with an amazing reduction sauce to add on. Very delicious! The staff were pleasant and helped with their knowledge of the menu"}
{"text":"The Living Room has long been one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary. We love it. Food and service has always been excellent! Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Went in to meet a friend for a cocktail. He called to say he would be late so i decided to go and sit at bar.  Ordered the special (sea bass in parchment with quinoa risotto) AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"I went there with a friend for a drink and a bite to eat. I thought the menu was rather limited and their wine list was not very interesting. The worst thing, however was the service. The staff are behaving as if they own the place and they are doing you a favour for serving you. My friend moved a chair to sit next to me and was told off about it. The restaurant was empty we were the only customers on Sunday afternoon so there was no need for attitude at all."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here as part of our quest to try all the nice/trendy restaurants in town. Our experience was fantastic. We debated back and forth on a wine, our server was fun, friendly and helpful/accommodating to us for that and in general. We really struggled between picking the Fondue's or Chef's tasting menu. We choose the latter. We are brilliant people. The chef's tasting menu may have been the best dining experience of my life... each thing that came out was better than the last and the last was the best thing I have ever tasted....  I'm told the items that come out always change and it allows the chef's to have a bit of fun and be creative. I have no idea what we ate... all items were familiar things presented in a way I had never tried before. I was a blast. It is a bit expensive over all ($250 ish with tip for 2) but that's kind of the point with our quest... eat well and with no regrets... I will remember this meal for years to come. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Loved the relaxing ambiance I felt upon walking onto the patio, made even more so by the attentive servers, willing to share a story and make you feel at home and attended to. I shared a lovely cheese fondue with my boss, had several nice glasses of red and finished with a seafood trio including snow crab legs, gravadlax (salmon) and tuna tartar.  All were fresh but none particularly inspiring.   I still left feeling satisfied and might try another dish if I ever have the opportunity to return."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad - some dishes like the scallops suffered from over-salting but their tartare is one of the better ones.  Atmosphere is lively and it's a very popular spot on 17th Ave.  The service is where I took a star off - our server did his job but had zero interest into carrying a conversation with us.  It was very much a Q and A session whenever conversation took place and that was it.  Could use a bit more friendliness..."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with the food, wine and dessert selections at The Living Room.  I went this past weekend, and my meal was absolutely delicious.  However, I was a bit disappointed with the atmosphere and service.  I know that restaurants can't always control how rowdy their guests get - but given the time of year when people are in the holiday spirit - I did not think it was appropriate to put a table for two right between their two largest tables when there were big groups sitting at both.  I've always liked going to The Living Room for intimate meals, and where I was seated with my date was very noisy and disruptive.  Once some other guests left, I had to ask to be moved - our server agreed but I think they should have offered without us having to ask, or offered us something complimentary for being disturbed by the other guests throughout our meal.  Our server wasn't feeling well, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt and she was understandably annoyed with these other guests as well.  In any event, when I'm spending $200 on a meal for 2 people, I have an expectation for a higher level of service."}
{"text":"On a rainy night in May, 2011, 6 divas dressed in red, headed to the Living Room for an Unofficial Yelp Event.  http://www.yelp.ca/events/calgary-cmye-ladies-in-red-girls-night-out-the-living-room  Prior to going to the Living Room for the first time, I did a little verbal research among my co-workers.  I was asking people who have gone to the Living Room, what they recommended on the menu.  When I was explaining that I was on a diet, they told me that the reality was, that I needed to consider the cheese fondue, and to throw my diet out the window for one night. The analogy I was given, was that you do not go to Red Lobster and order a chicken burger, right?    So, I had it... and, it was not under sold.  The cheese fondue was heavenly.  Between the six of us ladies, we ordered a number of different dipping options, and everything was delightful.   I also ordered the watermelon Caprise Salad which was a total knockout!  it looked like a watermelon inukshuk of sorts, that came with mozzarela, balsamic and fresh basil.  it was absolutely heavenly!  I was mentioning to my friends that I would absolutely come back on a hot summer day to have that salad again!    Thank you to the ladies in red for a fantastic evening, and thanks to the Living Room for being the host with the most!"}
{"text":"We had our Christmas dinner party at the Living Room this week. We were 11 people. We had a great time. We had the Chef's Tasting Menu - everyone has the same 4 courses. Fabulous. What they don't tell you is that you get 2 additional in-between courses, included. Wow.   Service was almost perfect - they fill your water glass (which you pay for) every 30 seconds. I noticed on Foursquare that the restaurant's drink special is something called a Stack. I ordered a round for everyone. The server promised to bring these out with the dessert course but they never arrived. Strange because it would have bumped his tip up a bit. Oh well, his loss."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant, definitely on the upper or fatter side of the wallet but worth it. Food is very well presented and the waiters are fun and experienced. I like when you can ask for a cocktail/gin and nothing sweet and they give you a proper recommendation - and also givena group good recommendations. We were a group of 6 ladies and they kept us all happy which can be challenging-ask our husbands. haha. Great food, lovely patio -all over solid Calgary establishment."}
{"text":"I went here for the Big Taste, which I didn't actually end up ordering.  The food was fantastic, fresh and really well done.  The wine was very good, and the list is long.  The only downside was our table, which was stuck awkwardly between other tables meaning the person not sitting against the wall would be bumped against every time someone went to one of the tables on either side of us.  Next time I'd request a better table."}
{"text":"I went here got seated right away. Was given menus waited over an hour and no one came to take my order. I even asked a different waiter if I could place my order I have been waiting a long time, he said he would grab my waitress waited another 20 minutes and ended up getting up and leaving the restaurant.   I'm unsure of how good the food is since I never got to order anything but the service was awful."}
{"text":"Shame on you! Worst culinary experience of my life ....twice burned! I consider myself a foodie and love great tasting food ... never gave a bad review before. Please do not bring a loved one here.  1)The food horrible priced and flavourless I would be ashamed to feed company with over cooked broccolini, tasteless over cooked fish. It's good they serve good wine because you need it.  2) Second time I went I was walking downtown to Look for a happy hour patio and thought well drinks are ok maybe they can redeem them self.  I stopped in and patio was dead empty I was told with my spouse at my side , well dressed I might add, \"we can seat you both but you have to leave in an hour and a half as we are booked\" we re-assured them we just wanted a couple drinks, they said ok then tried to place us in a dank dirty corner of the patio with spider webs\" when I saw what they had to offer I was mortified and insulted! The nerve ... so rude! And they think they are all that I tasted their food... it's all a front for vain twenty year olds who don't know better. Horrible management ... shame on you!"}
{"text":"My first night in Calgary, my friends took me out to dinner--they selected the Living Room Restaurant and had made a reservation.  We arrived around 8:20pm, 25 minutes before our reservation time and one of our friend was still on her way.  The host/owner told us to take a seat at the bar and he'll let us know when our table was ready.  Since my friend doesn't drink, we decided to walk around 17th Avenue instead.    We returned around 8:45pm, but our table wasn't ready yet--the reservation before us came late which pushed back all the reservations.  We waited in the foyer for the rest of our party and for a table to open up.  The host offered us drinks on the house which was very generous.  He brought me a whiskey and coke.  While waiting, people constantly coming in and out to chat with the guy or for a drink.  I heard him telling new customers coming in that the wait was at least two hours at that point and shortly after...they stopped taking names.  Make a reservation!  Tables are difficult to come by.  We were finally seated outside when our friend came around 9pm.   It was very busy and our server looked very stressed.  She told us that it was probably best to order all at once.  They had different varieties of raw oysters, I wanted sweeter ones and she made some good recommendations.  I ended up getting the Quebec Veal Short Ribs.  My friends had the Greens, Grain, and Tiger Pawns, and Callebaut Chocolate Fondue.  When she came with a basket of cut up baguette, we realized in her hastiness that she had put in an order for Cheese Fondue not Chocolate Fondue.  When we corrected her, she had a slight attitude but ended up apologizing for the confusion.  My short ribs was nice and tender, unfortunately, I liked all the other side ingredients more than the meat--the flavoring fell short for me, there was a hint of barbecue but lacked seasoning.  The chocolate fondue was delectable.  After finishing, we realized that our oysters never arrived and reminded the server. Ohh, they were good!  I got my non-oyster eating friends eating oysters.  Something we can't find in Portland is different varieties of fresh oysters.    I love the ambiance of the establishment and how friendly the host was toward everyone.  He covered our drinks for the wait.  I'll give the server the benefit of the doubt, it was hectic and she did consistently refilled our waters.   I would definitely dine here again if I was in town."}
{"text":"My trip to Canada was made worthwhile after a visit to The Living Room. To begin, the drinks were absolutely delicious! I fell in love with a ginger and mint simple syrup made with the bartender/owner's brother's locally grown honey.  Honey is supposed to be good for allergies therefore it is good for your health to have this drink! lol!  Then there was the meal itself...  My mouth was watering just from reading the menu:  \"Certified Black Angus Beef Tenderloin 8 oz. cutlet, seared Quebec foie gras, black truffle jus, roast fingerling potatoes (but I substituted mashed).\"  Pure perfection.  aaahh, these are a few of my favorite things!   As full as you may be, don't forget the extremely rich, delectable desserts!  mmm, chocolate  Food fit for a queen, which tasted even better when the bill for three people (including drinks) came out to only $170 US before tip!"}
{"text":"Living Room operates with their heads up their butts. The two stars are for the food. Their snootiness and dishonesty were the reasons for three star strikes. Tl;dr summary is available at the bottom.   I had a Travelzoo voucher for a prix fixe menu for 2 people. I'm not one to shy away from deals and I've found many of my favorite restaurants this way. The menu included a the kale salad to start, choice of one of two entrées (sausage ragu rigatoni or sous vide chicken), and a brownie dessert to share. We had a $32 charcuterie board on top of this.   The ambience is warm and inviting. The smell of truffle fondue was strong in the air. The seemingly disinterested bartender seated us, gave us a print out of the prix fixe menu and told us to \"just let us know what entrée you want\" before leaving. He didn't give us the regular menu and we were astonished at this omission. He must've thought we wouldn't be interested in ordering anything full price. Bartender, how else are you going to advertise your restaurant if you don't give customers the full menu? That's strike one.   Our server was friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable. The charcuterie board was pricy but the server sold it well. It came with 4 types of house-cured meats, honeycomb, olives from Turkey and Greece, apricot chutney, curried pickled veg and crackers. It was freaking delicious and the honeycomb was the bomb!   The prix fixe menu was delicious. The kale salad was fresh. The brioche croutons were a unique touch but I wish they used more green goddess dressing. Kale is the heavyweight of the leafy veg world; it can handle more dressing.The pasta and chicken were amazing. The portions were generous and we managed to save room for the brownie. It was moist, chocolatey and not too sweet.   Strike two came when the bill arrived. This isn't my first rodeo and I always tip based on the regular price. We were charged 15% gratuity on the regular price which was NOT mentioned to us. Before or after our meal. At all. For 2 people!!   Living Room, I hope you're reading this. I really wanted to fall in love with you. I understand that maybe other diners with vouchers skimped out after a wonderful meal and you'd rather get a guaranteed tip than trust your servers to provide quality service and your diners to tip accordingly. However, you SHOULD inform your diners if you're going to charge gratuity! That's customer service 101! My high school English teacher would call that \"lying by omission\". You're also the first restaurant I've encountered that's charged gratuity for a table of 2. Are you TRYING to commit business suicide?!?! Your blatant dislike of voucher users is apparently more important than attracting new customers during a poor economic climate. Wasn't that the point of the voucher? Living Room, you need to take your heads out of your butts and smell the recession.   We were originally going to tip 30% on the regular price for the awesome server and amazing food. However sneaking gratuity on a bill for 2 people and not be upfront about it left a very bitter taste in my mouth. That's how restaurants trick diners into tipping on top of tip. I'm normally a happy and fair customer, but suddenly, even the best food in the world couldn't fix this insult to injury (I haven't forgot the snooty bartender). We paid the 15% gratuity and not a penny more.   Strike 3 was for pissing me off. Apologies for the long winded review, Yelp.  Tl;dr: food was great, but staff are snooty and restaurant is trying to commit business suicide by charging gratuity to our table of two WITHOUT informing us at all. The nerve!"}
{"text":"We came here strictly for dessert. They were quite full and asked if we had reservations. We didn't, but they still were able to take care of us and gave us a table. We had creme brule and chocolate mousse! SO GOOD!!! One of the best places for desserts. If I came back with a larger group I'd definitely get the chocolate fondue! I need to come here every time I come to Calgary for a visit. OMG...I'm going to dream about the chocolate mousse every night now. I just loved it that much...mmmmmmm......"}
{"text":"Amazing...excellent...a total yes!!! Our server Ron was perfect and had a great sense of humor. He tactfully quieted down an obnoxious table near ours without anyone asking him to.  Our meal was one of the best I've had in Calgary because not only was it delicious and elegant but the portions were hearty and the value spectacular. I've not enjoyed this fusion of quality and value before. My husband and I had five drinks between us, a gigantic cheese fondue appetizer and a large 'interactive' entree of beef ribeye, asparagus, tri-color carrots, Yorkshire puddings and red wine jus for get this....$160. A steal really, which makes the Living Room stand out and makes it a dining experience not to be missed on 17th."}
{"text":"This is a really classy restaurant, where the servers are well educated about the food and the wine, and the chefs are obviously really good at what they do. Ideal for impressive first dates or special occasion dinners, you will not be disappointed.  Make sure you have a reservation."}
{"text":"SO yum. We did date night here a couple of weeks ago and had a great time. We arrived late so the place was mostly empty, and our server was nice but not overly friendly. We ordered the Oysters to start which were heavenly, as well as the Ahi Tuna Tacos - biggest pieces of tuna I've ever SEEN on a taco! They were a little hard to eat but they were delicious. Finally, we finished with the Truffle Cheese Fondue, which was sooo rich. We accompanied the cheese with some apple slices and broccolini, which went well with the richness of the cheese (next time, I will order the Aged Gruyere instead). The waiter took care of us even though the place was closing, and made us the best Amaretto Sours ever. The bill was high, which is expected, but the food was worth it. I'll definitely make it a point to return, probably to sit on the beautiful patio on a nice summer evening!"}
{"text":"I have three words for you. Watermelon Caprese Salad. And two more. Cheese Fondue. Then one more. OMG.  I had only ever been to The Living Room before for cocktails and wine. This time, it was the latter, but also food. It was not a cheap evening, but my-oh-my, was it ever a tease for my taste buds and an exercise for my waistline.  Let me start with the Watermelon Caprese Salad. It's three pieces of watermelon cut lengthwise, two on the bottom and one on top, covered with what I assume was mozzarella (as is common in a Caprese salad) and drizzled in olive oil and little \"flavour bombs\" of balsamic vinegar. Flavour bomb you ask? Why yes. Little brown beads made from balsamic vinegar, a thickener and some other kitchen magic to turn them into tiny edible beads. I'll be back for that salad alone.  Onto the cheese fondue. What happens when you put 6 women at a table with spears, food and melted cheese? A bubbling pot and table full of food that quickly disappears. Pieces of bread, grilled pink lady apples (my favourite!), chunks of sausage, asparagus, broccolini, mini-ravioli, it was a fine feast. With some cheese still bubbling and toiling away, we couldn't help but have a second round of asparagus and apples. Hey, at least we went for more fruits and veggies.  As I ate my food, I also sipped on a Screaming Viking, Grey Goose vodka with bruised cucumber. Refreshing! Why is it that cucumber seems to make every drink seem more fresh? I finished with my favourite, The Shaft. Introduced to me once upon a time by Tara M, this drink is \"tall, dark and cool\" made with Kahlua, espresso and skim milk. Make sure you stir it well or you'll end up with a rather strong iced espresso at the end of the glass.  As far as service goes, we couldn't have asked for a better server. Attentive and just flirty enough for a group full of gals, we were well looked after and entertained.  The inside is small and intimate, seating maybe 60 customers at one time. But what a lovely spot it is! Come summer, the patio provides an equally lovely evening sporting two outdoor fireplaces on 17th Avenue."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out this 17th Ave neighbourhood locale and finally had a chance to with a few friends. The patio had a very relaxed vibe literally, we went for drinks, but ended up staying for dinner. The atmosphere along with one of the owners created an environment where you would want to make this a part of your regular scene to catch up with friends. A few of our party sampled the \"Shaft,\" and swore by it's \"pick me up\" properties after a long work week.  P.S. Loved the Calamari!"}
{"text":"Very good menu - tried the chateubriand, very tender and tasty and excellent match with carrots. Great wine list focusing on smaller wineries. The steak tartare as starter is a no-brainer, very authentic."}
{"text":"So... 13 years ago we treated ourselves to our first taste of Chef Surprise. Besides being surprised at how much good food costs, we were delighted.  Fast forward and we move to Calgary. We decided to try it for our anniversary. Not sure if I've gotten snottier or expectations have changed but this one was different. We went with Chef Surprise again. I let our server know that I don't eat meat but do eat seafood and fish. When the first pork tasting came out, I was surprised. Apparently I didn't specify no pork and I felt like I really inconvenienced the kitchen. They made a new dish which was delicious. Food was great but service wasn't 5 stars. In a place like this, make your customer feel special and it will be a 5. Will try again after I explore some new choices."}
{"text":"I need to give this place three stars only due to the attitude of the host (Cliff, is it?) My husband and I were there with 5 friends. When we arrived we were ignored first for about 5 minutes. We were 6 at first and told Cliff a 7th person might be joining us and he got upset saying the reservation was for 6.  The food was very good and the service excellent! Justin was awesome. When our 7th friend joined us, Cliff didn't let us have a chair for him at the end of the table because \"someone else was sitting there\". No one used the two tables behind us and he wouldn't let us have a chair. My friend had to sit down at the end of the bench not being able to talk to the whole group. At the end of the night we told Cliff him that wasn't very nice and my husband said \"thanks for not letting us have that chair\". Instead of apologizing or being nice about it he said \"you are welcome\" and turned his back to us. Even though the food is good, as long as Cliff is there I will avoid the place. He makes you feel like you are a bother and you are not welcome at all. Too bad."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely fantastic.  Waiter offered good tips for the shareable plates and we were not disappointed! Only good things to say about the meal and service.   Only complaint was that they kept the door open and flies got in. We spent a few minutes swatting them away from our meal.  A drunk and disorderly also got into the restaurant much to the hostess' dismay - something to expect given the location. It took them a while to escort him out and away. Not something they can always control but perhaps management should have stepped in sooner?"}
{"text":"--- Food ---  Tartare $22 was incredible. Deliciously seasoned raw tenderloin with gaufrette chips.  My partner and I have tried different tartare before, and this was definitely our favourite.   I ordered a seafood pasta for my main plate.  The pasta was actually quite dry (needed more sauce?). The bread on the side was quite tough, not soft as I expected. I would not order this dish again.   My partner ordered the tenderloin main dish.  The meat was delicious and juicy. I think he would order that again.   --- Atmosphere ---  The restaurant is beautifully decorated inside and outside.  Our waiter provided excellent service. He was knowledgable on the dishes and very kind.   --- Summary ---  TRY THE TARTARE! You won't regret it :)  I would definitely come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"My bf took me here for dinner this evening, I have lived a block away for 2 years and FINALLY made it to the place with the beautiful patio......in October! Anywho, our waiter was Joseph and he was fabulous and knowledgeable all evening. We started with the tartare, classic and perfect. I had the short rib which was lovely and it had a lovely little Italian cabbage roll that tasted like Christmas. Bf had the pork tenderloin which had a nice bread pudding with hints of sage and orange. Finished with 2 SHAFTS and it was a great end to a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"I gotta get this off my chest.  My latest visit to the Living Room (for lunch) was quite mediocre, at best.  Living Room has long been one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary.   This most recent time that Jessica and I visited the Living Room, we underwhelmed and disappointed by both the food and the service.  Maybe it's because our last visit was such a high. Comparatively, we had amazing food, amazing service, and an amazing experience.  Upon arrival, I had dropped off Jessica to check in for our reservation while I looked for some street parking. When I came in the restaurant, I was not greeted with \"Your table is over here!\" or \"You must be Dan!\" or ANYTHING like that. I was greeted with a look that was something along the lines of \"What are YOU doing here?\" My fiancée had just entered 5 minutes before and the host wasn't looking out for the second member in a party of two? Strange.  I awkwardly began (uninterrupted), \"Um ... my fiancée ... came in ... and ... uh ... should be ... here ... somewhere ... AH! THERE SHE IS!\" Luckily, I spotted her. And the host's response? Nothing. No reaction at all. Just turned back to the POS screen.  Strike 1.  Throughout the course of the meal, the food was not very exciting at all. Our salad was very sad and boring, our monte cristo was uninspiring and the side of fingerling potatoes were a joke altogether.  A swiiiiiing and a miss, strike 2.  I would have asked for some house made ketchup, or aioli, or SOMETHING to save the dry mouthful of plain old potatoes, but I couldn't, and that brings me to Strike 3... Our server was INCREDIBLY uncommunicative through the entire meal. He brought us water that he did not clarify would end up being $3.00 on the bill, he offered no specials and not ONCE did he check in with us on how our meal was or even ask how the meal was after (hence, why I could not ask for any kind of saucy dip to quench the palate from the arrid desert of potato)!  Strike 3, you're out.  I have never received service this bad (not even from some of the one-star reviews I've written ... well, with the exception of Old Spaghetti Factory, Winnipeg), and it makes me sad because I love this restaurant so much.  I hope the Living Room reads this review and does something about emphasizing customer service. Maybe it's a daytime, lunch thing? I dunno! The time we visited before this one (and actually, EVERY time I have come before!) our server was EXCELLENT. Jessica and I were even commenting about how he thought of our every need before we even said anything. But this guy? He thought of nothing.  Sorry to rant, sorry to ramble, but I think it is only fair to sum up our experience and hope that for whoever comes to the Living Room in the future, they can have the wonderful experiences that we have had in the past and that all will be corrected or improved."}
