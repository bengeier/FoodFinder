{"text":"We visited this place today great food and good portions. We had Chicken Shawarma and Chicken platter and both were really good."}
{"text":"Had a mixed Schwarma plate today. It was HUGE. If you come to eat here, pack your appetite. They have lots of help here, so your served in a timely fashion. Looks like a local hotspot for our men in blue/black. While I was here 2 officers came in with two more joining a few minutes later. The wraps are huge as well. My plate was filled with chicken, beef, rice, salad, and potatoes. Also comes with tahini and garlic sauce for the potatoes. The wraps come with plenty of fillings as well.  They definitely aren't  cheap on the meat or chicken. A plate will set you back around $15. But you'll have enough left over for another meal. Check them out if you live in the area. It may be my new place to get a Schwarma or donair."}
{"text":"The donair was really good. Although too big. And they only had one size.  Im afraid i gave 2 stars because the falafels were an abomination. They need education on making proper falafel."}
{"text":"This place just opened so I had to try it. The food is really good, HUGE portions. I had the chicken shawarma plate, I have enough left over for another meal. The restaurant is clean and well set up. I will definitely be back."}
