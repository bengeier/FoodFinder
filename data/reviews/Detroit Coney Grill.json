{"text":"Top notch food and service..wife and I drove from uptown and well worth the effort! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"New owners...and a real disappointment. I used to eat here all the time.. I loved the authentic Greek salad.. tomatoes, cucumbers and real Greek dressing.. Now it's brown lettuce and vinaigrette. I paid extra for pita bread.. For that price I can eat twice at Wendy's and have a better salad and with chicken.. Chalk up one lost customer.  Oh.. and the on-line menu doesn't even come close to the new owner's menu.."}
{"text":"We love this place. The coneys are authentic. The chili cheese fries are a total upgrade with the fresh cut fries. And beets on my greek salad? Yes please. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden Gem! The woman who takes orders was beyond hospitable! If you are looking for a great home made burger & fries this place is for you. Our food came out in under 5 minutes and was delicious! While it's not fancy the food is top notch!"}
{"text":"The reason I gave them two stars is not because of the food but because it is a complete dump! The coneys and chili cheese fries were excellent but it's hard to eat when it's so unbelievably hot inside that sweat is dripping off my forehead into my food, it was truly miserable in there! I'm from Detroit, and let me tell you, none of the original coney spots are filthy and dirty like this one! It's a damn shame to represent Detroit like this."}
{"text":"Yay Detroit Coney Grill listens to their customers! Sliced beets on the Greek Salads! Great service great food!!!"}
{"text":"Came in today with my dad and had no idea what to expect. The food was delicious the service impeccable and the owner was very involved making sure everyone had a good time and great food!  This is a must come to place."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. They know what goes in a Greek salad, their gyros are $5, amazing chili cheese fries, coney dogs, loose burgers, Faygo POP, and Better Made potato chips.  I have been living \"out West\" for 12 years now, and have been on a mission to have a great Greek salad or gyro ever since.  I have tried a Greek salad at probably hundreds of restaurants (cheap and expensive) and they've never tasted quite right.  FINALLY! This is the Greek salad I've been craving!!!  Finally! This is the gyro I have been looking for!  My boyfriend proclaimed this the best gyro he's ever had, and I'd have to say it's at least the best I've ever had outside of Michigan.  At least.  I've also had the coney dogs and the chili cheese fries.  Of the 4 people I've brought with me on two visits, everyone was impressed.  The food is excellent, and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  They know they are a new restaurant, and they want to earn your business!  Let them!  Finally, in glancing at some other reviews, don't think you can only enjoy this place if you're from Michigan.  We're just happy to have a place with the word Detroit in it, but you'll enjoy this place if you like to eat, period.  Grab a group of friends and check it out!"}
{"text":"This is the best coney island around. We need on the west side. Like around Dysart & McDowell. We live in Goodyear."}
{"text":"I guess if I were from the motor city, I would be thrilled. Tried the combo \"dog\" that featured a tasty, well prepared dog that went \"snap\" & had good flavor. The \"loose meat\" half of the combo was flavorless ground burger.  Chili was good, probably just like back home...so I don't know what that standard is. Fries were fresh and just like inn out(s). clean, and they do have a t.v. and some healthy offerings...salads! For 8 bucks, I actually like the Hebrew national on an egg bun for a buck on Thur. Notes at tailgate a few doors down.  I wish these guys luck & I am happy for all of the \"Michiganders.\""}
{"text":"I was there with my two year old Thursday morning during kids club she wanted a hot dog so I went ahead and bought the kids club special and then on 2nd hot dog for me which cost a total of $8 I was shocked to see that my hot dog alone cost the same as her kids club special which was the same hot dog fries and a drink. But I paid it anyways and sat down and waited for our food upon receiving our food my two year old grabbed her hot dog to take a bite because it looks so good but it was slightly hot and she dropped it straight onto the floor right in front of the restaurant. When I asked the clerk if she could get another hot dog she told me she would have to charge me for another one since it had already been served and that would be another $4. What are ridiculous policy! So I just clean my hot dog off and gave it to her because I don't have another $4 to spend for a single hot dog."}
{"text":"Delicious!   Friendly staff. Quick lunch service. Good Food. Good price  I got the gyro. Flavourful & Juicy"}
{"text":"Great Coney and Great Burger! You want a place with great service and great food....here it is!"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough for this Michigan transplant.  There's nothing like a Michigan coney and these guys are the real deal.  Prices are good and the food is amazing.  The owner is a great guy and loves the talk about the quality and he backed it up.  Will definitely be returning again and again."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing here. Plus I love the decor and atmosphere. Reminds me of home."}
{"text":"My husband David and I decided to go their for our anniversary believe it or not lol decided to skip the fancy restaurant. But I have no regrets!! My husband was raised in the Detroit area so I knew it would be something he would enjoy.  It was so good the best coney dogs I have had and I was introduced to Faygo soda. I had the red soda one it was good alittle sweet for my taste but good. I would definitely go there again!!!!"}
{"text":"A little taste of home (if you're from MI) out here in Arizona.  Vernors, Faygo and coneys!!!  Come here and get your fix (even if you're not from MI)."}
{"text":"Thank you guys for bringing the great taste of Detroit to Arizona. I was in Phoenix for three days and ate there twice. I felt like I was back home on Lafayette Street. Please bring one to Tucson."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a piece of Detroit here in Phoenix. Anyone from the 313 knows that coney's make the world go round! This place delivers! Lafayette's chili is the best chili in Detroit, and that's what they serve.  Better Made chips, Faygo POP ( yup! That's what Detroiters call it!!) The owner is a down home Detroiter! This place delivers what we've been praying for. AND.. He is trying to open a place in the old Whataburger on Bell and 67th Ave. If you live in Glendale call or write the city to help get him on West Side. You have no idea  what you are missing!!! Detroiters UNITE!! Bring coney to our side of the city!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great customer service. I have tried this location and the one in Phoenix so far and the atmosphere of this location is like walking into a relatives house from the moment you walk in. I ordered the Gyro Pita and a Detroit Coney and throughly enjoyed both. The staff was engaged with their customers with casual conversation as well as asking for feedback. Definitely will be a place I return to!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had a really good coney dog.  Unfortunately, it'll be a while longer as Detroit Coney Grill only delivered an average coney dog. The coney sauce didn't seem original, almost as if from mass produced cans.  My search continues.  If only I could have some dogs from Coney Island in Fort Wayne, then I'd feel content."}
{"text":"This is the real deal! I won't even say this is the most authentic Coney Island in the valley, this is Detroit Coneys. The way everything tastes, looks, I'm back in the \"D\" every time I go there. If you're from Michigan or enjoy a good coney dog, this is the place you need to be. Make sure you grab a Faygo pop and a bag of Better Made chips on your way out!"}
{"text":"I was craving for food badly and we saw this place and decided to go there. *Fingers crossed* and yes! One of the places I always wanted to go to. Always been a foodie and this place knows my taste so well. The beer was chilled, chicken cheese burger was delicious, and the chilli chicken fries were excellent. The staff was well-disposed. I didn't have to wait for long. Service was quick and the price very affordable. Decent and adorable décor. Do visit here!"}
{"text":"Of course, Detroit Coney Grill has now become the Go To place for ex pat Detroiter's who live in the Phoenix area, Detroiter's who are here on vacation or business, and Arizonans who want to enjoy this original taste from Detroit.  Af t first, we we went for the Coney Dogs and fries that have that taste of back home.  So great!  Now , we've tried the Burgers  and they taste very similar to Greene's, Hunter House.  PLUS they have Faygo and Mexican Coke!  OMG!  The dilemma has become which to order so we order both the coneys and the burgers.  Keep up the great work David Najor and crew.  We ate there for lunch recently.  Couldn't be happier you are here."}
{"text":"If you know what real coneys should taste like this is the place to hit hands down. They have everything you would get in a coney from Detroit from faygo pop to better made chips."}
{"text":"Great authentic Detroit Coneys. Love this place. Great people working. Good atmosphere. You gotta go to Detroit Coney."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town . I rarely dine at the same  place two days in a row, but my when my brother told me he was craving a burger, I dismissed the thought until he mentioned  Coney Grill. Boy am glad he changed my mind . Yesterday's meal was as good as it always is, but today both the burger and chili cheese fries were the best I ever had. If you do go with the burger, don't shy away from both cheeses, bacon, jalapeño, grilled onion, and feta... it's the only way to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger. It was tasty, fast, and juicy, just like I like it! Fresh cut fries and a soda, around $7 and worth that. Staff extremely nice and encouraged feedback. Working nearby,  I will def be back for lunch another time! Also in the same strip mall as SubFactory which is my all time favorite lunch spot so this makes it perfect for me and my coworkers. Also, check in on yelp and get a discount!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Best coney and fries around! Staff couldn't be more friendlier! You will definitely leave here happy can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars but I can't. The only thing keeping Detroit Coney from 5 stars is the price. The good....great tasting hot dog! Flavorful dog with crispy skin. Chili was tasty and the fries were decent. The not so good...the price. No matter how good it taste, $4 hot dog is a lil steep. $34 for a family a 4 is high for hot dogs and fries. With all that said Detroit Coney is must if you love Chili dogs!!!"}
{"text":"The food is incredible. We got the chicken greek salad with beets. Yummy! And the Coney combo with Cajon fries. So good!!! The service was above and beyond. Excellent job."}
{"text":"A taste of Motown in the desert.  A Detroit Thanksgiving tradition in our family...head down to Woodward for the J.L. Hudson parade, stop into Lafayette Coney Island for our coney fix, watch the Lions lose and then the turkey and all the trimmings.  So glad to have Detroit Coney Grill in the valley! Every bit as delicious and tasty as Lafayette or American's coneys. Wash it down with a Faygo Rock n Rye or Redpop interspersed with some BetterMaid chips and with the airfare I save from flying from Sky Harbour to Metro Airport, I can indulge frequently.  Perhaps Detroit Coney Grill can get a beer/wine license and serve up a cold fire brewed Stroh's.  Looking forward to a north valley location closer to my Anthem home.  Detroit Coney Grill rocks!"}
{"text":"Love the Detroit Coney Grill! Food is great! I really get the taste of home (Michigan). I live in North Phoenix and it's worth the drive to both locations! Hope to see a coney grill in my area soon :)"}
{"text":"Awesome employees, great atmosphere, top-notch food, and fair prices. No doubt that these are the elements that set Detroit Coney Grill apart from other restaurants in the area. I hesitate to use the word \"competitor\" here, as the Coney Grill has no clear competitors. It's just an old-school vibe that makes every visit feel like time well spent. When combined with the quality product, there might not be a better casual dining experience than the one to be had at theDetroit Coney Grill."}
{"text":"Having been to Detroit many times I know good coney dog . This place is flawless in bringing the true flavors of Detroit to the Tempe area."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food. Just like Detroit Coney. Love that you guys sell Faygo Rock n' Rye. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I got the Detroit Coney w/ fries, and the Superman ice cream. All of it was so, so good! Definitely the best hot dog place I've been to around the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger, fries, coney dog, and chili cheese fries. The burger was delicious!!!! The chili cheese fries needed seasoning ...homemade fries...no seasoning. The chili cheese dog was nothing special. I'd come back for the burger for sure though."}
{"text":"Great Coney and fries with a friendly staff to boot! Happy with my choice for lunch today."}
{"text":"Had late lunch there Thursday with my wife, a native Michigander, and 2 friends.  I deferred to my wife on the quality of the food as she has eaten many times at Lafayette and American Coney in Detroit.   She felt the chili was lacking in spices and the burger meat was bland as well.  The fries seemed to be too dark brown in color, not sure if the cooking oil needs changing?  There was a placard on the table asking for feedback on expanding to new locations.  I concurred with my wife's assessment of the meat and chili, but also observed that the restaurant can use more attention to cleaning and could also use some touch-up painting.   The food was not bad, but does need tweeked slightly.  management should focus on setting standards for quality of the food as well as cleanliness of the facility before rxpanding.  We do wish them well in their endeavors."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places. If you haven't had the big d, you haven't lived. Great burgers & fries"}
{"text":"Love this place. Closest you can get to National in Detroit. If you're from the Detroit area, you have to go. I love the hani, it's always awesome and you can't get it anywhere else in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A must for those who love Chili Dogs! Everything is perfect! Make sure you have plenty of napkins, you are going to need them!"}
{"text":"Never been to Detroit or had a Cony.  Walked it and was greeted by a Dave.  Very friendly and helpful.  I told him to place my order for me to give me a taste I'd Detroit and he hooked me up with the 2 Coney meal and a Fargo Rock&Rye.  The food was excellent.   Tasted better than normal hot dogs and the frys were very good.  I'll be back to try the burgers next."}
{"text":"Excellent hot dogs, sauce, and hamburgers!  I got a hot dog with chili sauce and fries with chili and cheese, and my son and husband got hamburgers so I got try them (yum yum!). Excellent fries.  Absolutely loved.  Great quality."}
{"text":"This place is PERFECT!!! I'm from Detroit and everything tastes just like it did back home! If you're from detroit I highly recommend it! If you're not from detroit I highly recommend it! The faygo, the better made chips, and the even the employees all from Michigan! Dave the owner knew we were first timers and took the time to chat with us and ask about our experience! Everything in this place was stellar!!!"}
{"text":"OMG umm umm good! Slappin as my brother would say. I have been in AZ for 4 yrs and always said that when I go back home 2 the \"D\" Coney Island was gone be the first place I hit up for some grub. Well I don't have to wait anymore. Thanks to the first Detroit Coney Grill here in Az. The food was sooooooooo good. I even had a chance to meet the owner. He came out and asked me and my babies how was the food. He also plans to open up more locations in the valley. Also the most thing I love is that he imports all his food from the city."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Staff was friendly and my food came out fast and tasted great. Not to mention they have faygo! I'll definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Simple and tasty, limited menu but get to the point, small but just what you need.  My favorite is the buffalo chicken salad"}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Service! Better Made potato chips, Faygo pop, and Coney's like you will only find in Detroit. If your from Detroit then you will know what I'm talking about, if your not you definitely in to try it. Been to all 3 locations(Mesa, Tempe and Phoenix) great food and service at all three."}
{"text":"I never post reviews but this place is so good and the price is very very reasonable say the least for the very high quality awesome food you get."}
{"text":"This place is Da Bomb! It reminds me of the great food back home. We now live in Maricopa, originally from Livonia MI and will be back here often."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Ive had many Detroit coneys and this place took me back there."}
{"text":"The Real Deal!! not Hormal ... The only place in Arizona that reminds me of Detroit !!"}
{"text":"Being from the Detroit metro I've always missed having true Detroit style coneys when not at home. A friend told me about this place and I decided to give it a try and I was ecstatic to find a place that reminds me of home. The chili and the snap of the hot dog skins taste just like back in Detroit. I wish I would've  known about this place years ago!"}
{"text":"Good stuff and a great place to go one week after the wrought loss challenge weigh-in! Sense the sarcasm there as this burger (quad burger with grilled onions,  mushrooms,  bacon, American AND Swiss cheese) tasted great, which generally means it's really good for you, right?! Really want to try a coney next time here."}
{"text":"I came here because I'm from Michigan, so I had to make sure it was legit.  They had vernors, so they easily win with me.  The reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they're only open for a few hours.  I really wanted some vernors the other night.  Anyway, the chili dog was good, glad it wasn't pork.  It was beef.  Good spot to grab a bite to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"If you're from Detroit you can't miss this place. The best coneys outside of Detroit. Need to open a place in Peoria so I can go all the time."}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I stopped by before I went to work because he's been eyeing this place. The philly cheese steak in a pita is basically everything I love in one meal. The staff are super friendly and Dave definitely tries to make sure EVERY customer is happy. The chili cheese fries... I would definitely drive all the way back up here to get some more! Ah and the cooks are great! They do such a good job and are as nice as the owner. Will definitely come here again, no doubt! :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere was welcoming as soon as I stepped thru the door. The owner David greeted me with a smile and a push pin to put on a map of Detroit to say where I was from. I ordered a faygo red, two bags of better made red hot chips cause there is no other chips like them. A coney dog with grilled onions and chilli chesse fries. The coney dog was good but not over flowing as you would get back home where it was mandatory to eat your coney dog with a fork. I was able to pick up my dog and eat it with it Going all over my fingers, which is a part of a great coney dog. I do want to try the curly fries that they make right in front of you and maybe a burger.  I do have to say that I had walked by a guy eating a double burger and the look on his face was that of pure bliss. The owner David casually walked among his customers and I casually ask for a picture. He did not hesitate in obligeing me. We went outside and took a pic in front of his eatery's logo. Overall, absolutely a place to go eat. Ground meat is made right there and looked delicious.  I was ok with my coney dog and chilli chesse fries but in think I was more jazzed about having a faygo red. Even as I was walking out the door I got a I really hope you enjoyed the food. Great atmosphere.  Next to try burger and red hot fries."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The real deal. A must try if your from Detroit. Would love to see one in Mesa..Falcon field area."}
{"text":"Finally a piece of Detroit has come to the valley. Detroit coney grill's coney dogs are exactly how a Detroit coney dig should taste. Right away you know it's the real deal just by the snap in the dog and the hearty all beef chili. I was lucky enough to go on a day where they had a special menu item coney fries which is fries with chili cheese and loose meat. The staff is very friendly and atmosphere is very inviting. For any of my fellow Michiganders who have not yet been to Detroit coney grill I highly suggest you check it out."}
{"text":"Yum... Yum.... Good food friendly service. Coney combo ...sooo good. Fries......? Sooo good.   The food was good."}
{"text":"First time here burger, fries and orange Faygo were great and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw this place on my way to work. Now that I've tried it I'm even more excited.   The employees were so friendly, the other patrons were all chit chatting with each other about Michigan, and the food was just how a coney should be. The owner is so proud of his business, and it's nice to see. I told him I'd be back since I work so close and he was honest that call in orders around lunch time are a no go since they're just so busy, but that it moves quick and not to be discouraged by a line. The honesty is refreshing for sure. He also was honest with my family of 4 and told us we all didn't need our own order of fries; that one or two would be plenty.   I can't wait to see this place flourish, and I'm thrilled for the addition of desserts that the owner mentioned will be coming."}
{"text":"I work very close to Detroit Coney Grill.  When driving to find a place to eat one day on my lunch I saw the sign that DCG was opening soon (I even went up to the window to see how far along the construction was to gauge to timing).  I waited with anticipation and the day finally arrived.  I took some of my co-workers with me because they did not even know what a coney was.  Being from the Detroit area myself, I had come to appreciate the finer things in life, such as a true Detroit-style coney.  Needless to say my co-workers were very impressed and simply loved my little slice of home.  DCG not only serves the authentic Detroit Coney experience with the hot dog/coney and hand cut fries, but you can also feast on Better Made chips and wash it down with \"real sugar cane\" Faygo POP. Great food and staff make eating at Detroit Coney Grill the highlight of my work week.  Thank you to the owner who finally stepped up and brought a \"real coney\" to Arizona."}
{"text":"Pretty dawg gone good coney and famous Detroit chili.  Nearly just like back home.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, prices were reasonable, and the food was quick and delicious. The meat is ground in house, and the patties are thin and layered, with cheese between each slice (or so it seemed). Do yourself a favor and add avocado.   I loved my Cajun fries, while my husband thought the regular fries were good, but a touch soggy. I didn't notice that at all, though it could be because I dumped a ton of malt vinegar on them.   Either way, this is one of the best burgers either of us have had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"There burgers are A1 straight flames for your big appetite munchies. There coney dogs are authentic as hell. Taste just like Detroit Michigan's coney dogs!! There burgers are like gods gift to my burger obsession!! Big, juicy, and comes with the works. I very much recommend this location to any burger or coney lover,its a must visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Super excited to find a real Detroit coney island here in AZ. They had Faygo Red Pop and Verners! Owner, employees, and most customers are all from Michigan so real friendly atmosphere. Will continue to drive here all the way from PV but crossing my fingers for them to expand and have a closer spot."}
{"text":"Thanks to Dave and the guys from bring  the D to the AZ!!! Love the Town Club!!! Now bring it to Gilbert!!!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Detroit.  My favorite Coney Island is Lafayette Coney in Detroit.   I am the son of a former Motown Records artists  I currently live in a LA and visiting Az.  I know my coney dogs!  This place is spot on!!!  Great Balance of an oustanding chili, Spanish onions, mustard and a perfectly steamed bun!  This OG Detroiter gives Big Props to Detroit Coney Grill!"}
{"text":"Taste like home. The coneys are awesome, then add a Faygo and some \"Better made\" chips, how can you go wrong."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I am new to Phoenix. I moved here from Pittsburgh a year ago. The food here took me back home. The big dogs are amazing.  The quality of the food is excellent. The customer service is excellent. The owner David is very engaging and takes pride in his food and provided a genuinely well rounded experience for his customers. This is by far my new favorite restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"I've been living in Phoenix for 18 years. That means I've spent 18 years having coney withdrawal. Finally, Arizona has the real deal. If you are from Detroit you have to come here. I've been here 3 times. It's been great every time. If you aren't from Detroit you should still check it out. Have a type of hot dog that is different (and better) than any dog in your life.  And rumor has it that the burgers are very good too but I cannot confirm as I haven't tried it yet.   Just one complaint: time to add MSU photos to offset those UGLY UofM photos on the walls."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great food, friendly service, quality products. I love this place & I'll be back & refer it to my friends! Love the chili coney & Faygo soda. Fries are delicious and made fresh. Try it & you won't regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place by accident. The food is great. My coworkers and I are eating here 3 times a week now. One of the best Greek salads I've ever had. Plus, the service is really good. Fast, friendly and delicious."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! Angelica and her team provided exceptional service! The restaurant was clean and the food was perfectly prepared. We will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"First time here and I have to recommend it.  I ordered the gyro pita to take back to my desk and was surprised it was still piping hot when I opened it. This looks like the type of place where everything will be good!  Next up... burger and fries."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 dogs no onion when I got to hotel 3 had onion, so I had to drive back to fix order. Also ordered 3 chilli fries and portions don't even fill half of container, for 3.95 not worth it"}
{"text":"Wow! Fabulous ambiance and service. The food was amazingly good. I will keep going and going here until I am too fat to fit through the door. Yup! It is that good."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, friendly.  You obviously don't have to be from Detroit to enjoy it, but if you are, there's definitely a sense of nostalgia.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Flew in from DC and stopped by this place....AMAZING!!  Customer service is awesome; Crissy was very friendly and made great recommendations."}
{"text":"Best authentic Coney in the Valley. I'm from Michigan and have had plenty of coney island in my days. For just opening this place is doing phenomenal. Very enthusiastic  owner and work-staff, great food and very reasonable prices. So far I've tried their hani and chili cheese fries. I'm normally not a fan of thick-cut fries, but these fries couldn't be cooked more perfect and the chili tastes just like the chili back home. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Best hot dog I've had since I moved out here; you can't beat natural casing :^) Chrissy's service was great too, if I wasn't broke I would have left a tip :v)"}
{"text":"Great coneys! Love that I have a bit of home here in Arizona!  Worth the trip down to Tempe!!"}
{"text":"Come eat till you can't walk it's great fresh fries, n best burgers. Must try the chili cheese fries and try burger but don't stop there need to get a coney dog too so come on a Thursday"}
{"text":"OMG!! Just like home! Finally after 22 years of living here in AZ, a real coney place. Just wish it was closer to home! Now found it will be a highly frequented place. YUM!"}
{"text":"This was best coney dog place I've been too outside of Michigan. It definitely has the complete feeling of being in Detroit and getting an amazing Dog. The chili was a little bit watery for what we're used to but that's just preference. We are very very happy to have stopped by.   The staff was amazing. They all stopped by at least twice to see how we were doing. Also when we left, I forgot my purse, they called and we were able to turn right around and get it.   All in all, amazing experience to a missing Michigander.  Tangerine and I10 would be LUCKY to have you!!!"}
{"text":"I was in the Phoenix area for business and found this place.  I thought I'd gone back to MI.  I haven't lived there for about 20 years now, and since I moved West of the Mississippi I've not found anything resembling Coney.  I had to stop, and I'm so very glad I did!  It tasted like I remembered, plus they had Faygo Pop and Better Made chips.  It was a nice taste of home."}
{"text":"Its great to see people that genuinely care about the food.  Hand made dogs, hand cut fries, in house ground-ground beef.  Well done Detroit!  Will eat for lunch here often, for sure."}
{"text":"Reminds me of going back to Michigan and seeing my family great place and environment!!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype.  Got the quad burger (4 patties) with cheese, standard fixings (lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickles, ketchup) added grilled onions.    Came out so hot, I had to let it rest.  I usually add salt to everything, but not this time.  Not because it was salty, it was just seasoned perfectly.  Grilled onions came through with flavor.  Burger is super greasy, but awesome.  All that greasy goodness can be a little rich, so I recommend cutting it with Faygo branded rock and rye drink."}
{"text":"Love the owner, has the east coast persuasion! lol Food-Fast,Fatty anddd Fabolous! Had the quad cheeseburger love the meat plenty of it and chesse melt beautifully! Partner had the philly on pita! YASSS! Hot food, great service, MUST TRY! Thank you I will be back soon when I need a burger or philly! Only thing-stay open later I know the college kids will come all hours of the night!"}
{"text":"The best Coneys in Phoenix! Danielle and her dog patrol are great! Nothing like a Coney, Cheese Fry, and a Faygo to make you forget about the daily grind. Wish there was one closer to Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"This place is legit! Real Detroit coney and awesome fries! Love everything about this hot dog joint!"}
{"text":"The triple cheeseburger is great! Chrissy my cashier had wonderful customer service! I would eat here every day if I could!"}
{"text":"Great food Great service! This review?  You're earned it! 5 stars Thats your quality Am  writing lyrics? Yea, ur on to me! Motivated by My chili cheese fry Hand ground beef Onions make me cry So I cry I river Cuz the coney's great! Only wish my mouth were bigger... I'd Eat the damn plate! Lol!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Detroit and lived outside Flint for many years, both hotbeds of coney activity. Lafayette, American and Angelo's have been rated at or near the top of this type of dogs for MANY years.Not just in Michigan, but throughout the U.S. . I ate a lot these dogs since I was a kid.   These young guys have really done their homework. Great stuff and I enjoy their enthusiastic attitude toward their work! The dogs are of the natural-skin variety that really pop when you bite into them. The coney sauce has the kind of taste that I've dreamed of for some time now.  The last time I attended the N.Y. State Fair in Syracuse I discovered that a \"coney island\" was a grayish  dog and what I knew as a coney was called a \"Michigan Red Hot.\" So the history of this food belongs to the \"Mitten State.\"  Note: for the first time in my life I ordered a hamburger at a coney place. The boys grind their own meat and the burger was beyond belief. I enjoyed it much better than a couple I've had for $11 in some much fancier places.Theirs  costs $2.95.  Just hope my cardiologist doesn't read this."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The owner is super friendly and wants to hear your feedback. He asked if we had been there before and made some menu suggestions for us first timers. My hubby tried a burger and I got a couple coney dogs and some Red Hot fries. The chili was great, the dog was firm and didn't taste like some greasy, cheap piece of mystery meat, and I've been craving the fries ever since! My hubby's burger was a bit greasy but the toppings were fresh and it tasted great! I'm typically not a hot dog person, but a friend was visiting from out of town and was in the mood. Glad we found this place; we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went today with my co-worker from Walgreens. We both enjoyed the food and the prices. I felt like I was back in the \"D\".  It's wasn't crowded. The atmosphere was nice and cozy. Thank you for opening less then 3 minutes from me. Thank you for bringing Detroit to Arizona."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!   Great food!  Even if you are from the state up north.   Go Bucks!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in one day and have been going ever since.  This place has excellent food and the service is even better.  They need to open out in chandler area."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent the owner was awesome the food was just like home A++++++   definitely will be back. Had My usual 2 coneys chilly cheese frys. The food was perfect haven't left yet can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I am a transplant from the Detroit area.  Since 1984 I have not been able to find a real Coney.  The first thing I do when I go back to MI is find a Coney.  This place is home.  The Coneys are the real deal.  They have Faygo pop, Better Made chips and the fries are fantastic.  The salads are fresh and a massive proportion.  The map on the wall of the greater Detroit area is fun.  They provide push-pins so you can mark your home town.  From the friendly greeting at the door to checking up on you during the meal, the owner obviously loves what he is cooking and makes sure each and every guest is happy.   I cannot recommend this place enough.   Especially for fellow Michiganders."}
{"text":"Best tasting hot dogs, reminds of back home in Michigan. I eat at the Lafayette Coney island all the time. These guys here in Phoenix are right on. Having Faygo pop and Better Made chips knocks it out of the ballpark."}
{"text":"Just like back home! Very friendly staff, excellent food! Bring it to the West Valley (Surprise please)"}
{"text":"Born and raised in Detroit and this is best coney dog I've had outside of Detroit.  They even have Faygo pop... yes, pop, not soda!    Truly enjoyed it again and will return.  Great crew of guys as well."}
{"text":"If you're a fellow Detroiter this is your home away from home; great food, service, and atmosphere. They even have hani's!!!! I moved to Deming,NM 4 years ago from MI and I miss the food the most. I came to AZ for my birthday and getting a hani and a rock n rye was the best birthday present ever! Please please open one up in Las Cruces, NM, I will keep you in business!!!"}
{"text":"I am so thrilled that this place opened. We just moved here from Southeast Michigan, and I honestly didn't think I would survive without a proper coney anywhere nearby. The chili is awesome, the dogs are PERFECT, and the fries are super duper good. Totally the real thing. Anyone who's driven 20 miles for a Lafayette late at night will appreciate this spot. This was our first of many visits and I can't wait to try everything on the menu. They have hanis too, which I plan to try after I try a gyro. The owner said he's hoping to do breakfast at the North Phoenix location, and I'll drive to that one at least once a week for a greek omelette and pancakes.  Also, the patrons make the place a Michigan lovefest. Prepare to get nostalgic for home."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!! One of the best places to go in all of Arizona. It's got a great atmosphere and amazing customer service. The best part about it is that it taste exactly like the coney island in Detroit. This is a must go to restaurant. I recommend to try the Coney Dogs and Hani's you won't be disappointed.   Grand ave and Bell rd would be a great location for another Detroit Coney Grill."}
{"text":"The Big 3 of coneys......American Coney, Lafayette Coney, and now Detroit Coney Grill........thanks for bring the D to the Phx....  We need one in Northwest valley"}
{"text":"So lucky to have a place like this in Arizona, not only should people familiar with the coneys from Detroit visit this place but people all across Arizona should come give it a try. I know the owner is now catering events which I know would be a big hit with even the toughest critic. This place will make you think very differently about what a Chili Dog should taste like which will keep you coming back over and over again. Looking forward to watching this concept grow in Arizona."}
{"text":"Found this place while waiting for car to get repaired, awesome food, service and prices! Calling their regulars by name."}
{"text":"I've seen the sign a few times when I've been downtown. I just thought they were trying to ride on the Detroit name. Well I went in and except for the fact that it's not a long room, I'd have sworn I was back at Lafayette Coney island in Detroit. I got The special: 2 Coneys, fries and drink for 9.99. The dogs had the right snap. And for a dollar more I got a Vernors (in a glass bottle). They also sell Faygo (also in glass bottles) and I had a bag of Better Made chips. David and his crew are very friendly. And the map with the pins representing all the Detroiters who've been there is a nice touch. I'll definitely be back, although the one in Tempe is closer to my Mesa home."}
{"text":"Great service from Crissy and Danielle while visiting from MoTown.   Awesome Coney ! Great service !"}
{"text":"Can I just say that this place.. Is AMAZING! Tastes just like the coney dogs back home. I'm so glad I discovered this place. My sister and I have been in twice now coming from paradise valley. They DEFINITELY need a location by us!! The owner is a super nice guy and his staff is great too! No complaints!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service.  Faygo!!  Food was good and the entire family enjoyed our various orders.  One negative is the big bun to dog ratio, it's good for the full coney toppings but for anyone wanting a simple hot dog it's too much bun.  One a scale of 1 to 10...8.6!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is tucked away in the mall, but it is. It is very good. Fries are outstanding. Coney dog is outstanding. Front counter girl was super nice.  My kids loved it and I really enjoyed having a fresh made meal in the mall. Going to try a burger on the next visit!  Well done Coney Grill."}
{"text":"Felt like I was back home at the Lafayette Coney Island - and that to me is heaven.  I ordered \"2 on 1, lite onions\" and we were speaking the same language.  The fries were good.  My husband had the combo with the loose meat hamburger and loved it.  With Faygo POP, not soda, and Better Made chips, how can you go wrong?  If you are from Michigan especially, you will love it."}
{"text":"The coney dogs here are decent, the buns are simple store bought ones so nothing special, the chili is pretty good though. The fries were pretty disappointing, they are fresh and hand cut but greasy and soft. I guess if you grew up near Detroit I can see this place's appeal but there are plenty of other dog joints in Phoenix that do it better, this place isn't even the best dog in Tempe. Stick to Ted's or Dave's or even Lobby's if you like Chicago style."}
{"text":"Instantly transported 2K miles back to MI as soon as you walk in. From the decor, to the friendly Detroit hospitality, to the authentic eats. Would love if you decided to expand out further East. Even if you're not from MI, you will love this place. Oh, Faygo in a bottle, need I say more."}
{"text":"Yum! As a Michigan native, their chili is on point, their hot dogs have that \"snap\" we all expect from a good coney and... Faygo!! Super nice staff as well. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Decent coney dogs, friendly service. Hand cut fries a bit undercooked but overall very satisfied."}
{"text":"Great place to eat for the whole family. Great welcoming environment, cooks make you feel like family. Great coney dogs, fresh and hand made all real meat, fresh cut fries,  good burgers. Variety of Faygo drinks, especially the flavor \" Rock & Rye\".  You can watch the cooks cook everything. Good food and great prices. Will definitely be coming here more."}
{"text":"People have been telling me to come to this place for weeks but I figured it was just another five guys type joint but that is most definitely not the case with Detroit Coney Island. As an avid burger lover....let me rephrase that, as someone who eats a burger for every other meal and never met a french fry that she didn't like, I gave Detroit Coney Island five stars. The owner told me that I could have my burger any way I wanted it, he encouraged me just to tell him exactly what I wanted versus looking at the menu. The burger was juicy, the seasoning on the fries was zesty and most importantly I didn't leave feeling sick like I often do after eating greasy food. I didn't think anybody could do it better than Inn n Out in terms of a good, fast burger but this place is my new go to - hands down! Even if you don't like the food, the owner (whose name escapes me) is super friendly and very intent on making your dining experience unique. I wish Detroit Coney Island the best of luck in its plans to expand and I know I'll be first in line when theres one in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Authentic Detroit Coney Island, complete with loose burgers, gyros, coneys, even Vernors and Faygo!  A classic!!"}
{"text":"Finally! Detroit coneys in the desert!  This is the real deal! The chili is perfect and, my favorite, the hani was simply perfect! Thank goodness I only work 5 minutes from this place because I would be making at least a weekly trip here if not!   The opening of this restaurant might save me a couple trips a year back to the Mitten state! Woot woot!   Detroit food and drinks = A happy Michigander!"}
{"text":"If you are from Michigan and living in Arizona you are cheating yourself by not coming to the CONEY Island in TEMPE!!! There is another CONEY Island in North Phoenix... But the original family that used to have that place is no longer there and the FOOD IS NASTY NOW!!! We came all the way from Laveen, Az and WE LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"The coneys, fries, greek salad and the Vernors, of course, taste just like back in the 'D'. If you're from Detroit you you'll want to visit.  Coneys are discounted to 3.13 (313 area code) the day after a Lions win, like today!  We definitely need a Detroit Coney in North Scottsdale, preferably near Pima & Pinnacle Peak so I can walk there :)  Keep up the great work!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll get right to the point, I'm a Michigander so I'm a little bias.  However a tad bit of history research will show you that the Coney Dog (aka Michigan dog) was founded in Jackson MI (THE ORIGINAL CONEY ISLAND) so all you native New Yorkers \"Get outta here!\" (JUST KIDDING, http://www.wikihow.com/Talk-Like-a-Stereotypical-New-Yorker).  Of course when I first moved to AZ years ago I was used to natural casing hot dogs (skin dogs).  Unfortunately Arizonian's didn't know what that was as they are familiar with the boring old skinless hot dogs.  Thus began my search for a skin dog in AZ.  After a few years I could occasionally find them in some of the grocery stores in the deli area but I still could not find them in a restaurant.  I started looking up top hot dog places in AZ and would go out of my way to find a skin hot dog but would be left with zilch.  After awhile I decided to give up my search since Arizonian's didn't like the skin dog.  My wife is from Ohio and she doesn't even like them, go figure.  I guess you have to grow accustomed to it but once you like them no other hot dog is ever the same.  Finally a place called Portillo's opened in Tempe and knowing they were from Chicago I decided to give them a try.  I even asked my friend Sam if they had skin dogs and she assured me they did.  I went up to the counter and asked if their hot dogs were skin dogs and they said yes.  However I mistakenly ordered the big hot dog as I didn't know there was a difference and when I got it it was just another SKINLESS hot dog.  I was extremely disappointed and went back to my friend and told her Portillo's does not have skin dogs.  She told me again that they did so we went together the next time so she could prove me wrong.  It turns out they do have skin hot dogs but you have to order the regular hot dog as the bigger one is indeed just skinless.  It was good but something was still missing, THE CHILI PERHAPS?  Well I didn't think I'd be getting true MI chili but another friend of mine (Colin) told me about Detroit Coney Grill as it had just opened.  He asked if I had been there which I hadn't.  One day I decided to visit and low and behold they had Better Made chips by the register!  I knew I was on to something because Better Made is made in Detroit.  These are NOT your salty Lays!  So I started talking to the owner about the hot dogs and he explained they were skin dogs.  PEOPLE THEY ALSO HAVE CURLY FRIES LIKE MI!  I began eating the hot dog but wasn't expecting the chili to taste like MI chili BUT IT WAS!  The coney dog is just like back home, chili and all.  So IMO there is nothing better than a hot dog from DETROIT.  Detroit Coney Grill also has good burgers but that's not why I come, GET THE CONEY DOG!"}
{"text":"Awesome, My new recommendation to anyone who wants a fabulous meal at a decent price.  The cheese and chili with loose meat fries are to die for !!"}
{"text":"There is finally a real coney dog in Arizona. Order the chili cheese fries with shredded cheese, The Big D and a Fago. Done. That's it. Boom check it off the bucket list. Say hello to Dave for me."}
{"text":"Still come here often and still haven't been disappointed.  Guys always ask how I like my fries and they haven't failed to deliver on the goods.  I still make the mistake of calling the pop \"soda\" but it is a learning process.  Great service and food all around, hope they will stick around for a long time."}
{"text":"I frickn love this place, I went with my Chaldean friends today 4/16/2016 for lunch, Ive never been to Michigan or Detroit and DAAAAAAYMMNNNN that Coney hotdog and Double patty burger was soo good...very unique and different from any local stuff...and the owner was an awesome man who treated us soooo good and gave us something I never tried before \" SUPERMAN\" ice cream...Im a great fan of the authentic Italian gelato ice cream, not soo much of the Amercan thick crap, but the superman ice crea was so good like it had taste and melted quick once you try it, its definitely unique and im not a huge Ice cream fan myself, but when I go there again...Ill definitely end my meal with the \" SUPERMAN\" ice cream...its a killer...owner is an awesome dude...im not from Detroit but now I am ;)!!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The location is small but adequate. The customer service was great."}
{"text":"I never do reviews but i had to thought I found a gem but I want be coming back. I ordered a triple chilli cheese burger onions and mustard ,get back to work open up sandwich no mustard but they put miracle whip wow!!! Chilli and miracle whip?so I call owner says sorry he will take care of it next time I come back so I come back today order same thing triple chilli cheese burger onions mustard lady tells owner he kept his word on the house he tells he should have none better chilli and miracle whip so cool get my food get down the way sumthing told me to check it out look at burger no chilli so I turn aound and go back he tells me I didn't order chilli but he would give me sum ? I try to hand him the bag he gives me a little ketchup container of chilli.I was not looking for a hand out I just wanted what I ordered if i wanted a deal i would have went somewhere with a value meal.IF you're reading this your employee costed you a triple cheese burger and a teaspoon of chilli you costed your self a good customer.Good job!!"}
{"text":"What a great find! The hot dogs had that crisp casing that snaps when you bite in. The coney sauce was delicious and the cheese sauce we got on our fries was down-right addictive. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only negative thing I could find was the floor & tables seemed a little dirty, but I think they were just worn down."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!!! Get the Big D! The hand cut fries are amazing as well, only complaint is they could be open later! ;)"}
{"text":"Dave's restaurant is amazing. The dogs are hands down the best in town and with fresh cut fries i am now spoiled and can't go anywhere else. Everything is super fresh and best quality. Service is phenominal. Buffalo chicken salad... wow. Hanis... try one. You'll be hooked though I must warn you. Can't wait to have a fresh ground burger next. You can feel the love In Dave's amazing creations. Good quality food, service and people. Home run."}
{"text":"So freaking good. This location does not disappoint.  Just as good as the Tempe spot!"}
{"text":"A taste of home! I always feel a little less homesick when I can come in here and order coneys, beter made bbq chips, and a rock & rye! We need a Detroit Coney Grill in mesa!"}
{"text":"Our favorite little burger spot in town! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. We bring the kids here after games with the team and they are always accommodating. You get exactly what you pay for which is very affordable, no gourmet, just the classics (which we love) like some of the best burgers I've ever had anywhere. Very good, had to stop by and leave these guys a review."}
{"text":"Authentic Detroit coney in the heart of Phoenix!  Yum! Blows all others away! Don't forget the Faygo pop!"}
{"text":"Just like back in the D! Chile was up to Detroit standards.  Fries were fresh out the deep fryer.  They have the new self serve coke machine so plenty of pop (that's what we call soda in Detroit) options.   Air conditioning wasn't pumping very strong so it was quite warm for dine in.   If you are from Michigan make sure to pin your hometown on the map."}
{"text":"I'm from MI, lived downtown Detroit for 3 years a love hotdogs!!! This place is amazing ! The closest thing you can get to the real thing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Better Made Potato Chips! Faygo! Vernors AND Town Club. Unreal. I was born and raised in Detroit and there is No imitating a real coney dog. These are the original. ALSO, the customer service is AWESOME! Chrissy greeted me and helped me with the daily special. She rocked it. And David, from SW Detroit, made me feel right at home! I will be back, with friends and family!"}
{"text":"I miss home. Glad I have a little bit of it here in the city!    I always get the Hani with Fries. It's by far my favorite and the one I would always order back home. Here the portion size is so big I had to take it home. I never had leftovers back in Detroit."}
{"text":"I still love the Hani the best! I didn't realize they have different specials for different days of the week. I thought that was a nice touch and I feel the prices are fair. Makes me crave to go back home to Detroit.  I'm gonna be a regular here I can just feel it!"}
{"text":"Being a Detroit native, you're used to  people coming off as rude...we aren't, we just aren't going out of our way to kiss your behind. Order your food, eat it, 'nough said. The hot dogs and chili are THE BEST at this place, hands down. Wouldn't compare it to a fast food joint's hot dogs because those guys are not even on Detroit Coney dog's level. Don't have to be from Detroit to love this place, but definitely love that they have one in town."}
{"text":"Being from Detroit... this place hits the mark.  Coney's are all beef and delicious!!!  Will definitely be back.  The food here makes me home sick."}
{"text":"I got 2 chilli cheese dogs and fries and a drink. Price was a tad higher than I would have thought but considering it's a mom and pop shop I figured hey everyone deserves to make a living. Food was hot and fresh. Fries are thick cut with the skins on. They were amazing. Chilli dogs were good. I tend to like a bunch of salt on my food and didn't grab any (order was to go) if I had dashed a bit of salt they would have been perfect. Lady taking orders was funny and I energetic. Great wit and charm. All in all great food, fair price, fun people. Glad I grabbed lunch there."}
{"text":"Hotdog coney style felt like home back in the D. The hotdogs are 100% beef! Grabbed bar b que Better Maid chips and a Red Faygo!"}
{"text":"I come from the heart of coney land.  I have probably eaten a thousand Koegel hot dogs in my life.  I love coney dogs; hell, I love hot dogs.  Staff is super nice in this place.  My hot dog was over cooked which was a bummer. The coney sauce was off just a hair.  There was a dominate spice that I could taste predominantly in it.   The fries were great.  I will probably give this one more try."}
{"text":"After my first visit to Detroit Coney Grill, I was hesitant to leave a 5-star review. I wanted to be more objective and wondered if I wasn't wearing homer goggles. After multiple visits it's clear that Detroit Coney Grill is legit. Everything I've ordered has been top notch. The coney dogs, the loose burgers and the classic burgers and, of course, the fresh cut fries (go Cajun style!). They do it all and they do it greatly. You will not find a better coney dog in the valley. It does not matter where you are from, the food is fantastic. Detroit Coney Grill has become one of my favorite dining spots in the valley. This is also the only place I know of where I can order food and wipe my feet on an Ohio State rug (the homer in me loves this)."}
{"text":"I genuinely love coming here!  As my family originates from Michigan, but we live in Arizona, it is quite nice to be able to eat some authentic Detroit food without buying the plane ticket to travel there.  It makes us feel like we are home, and the cony dogs are a plus too :)"}
{"text":"Went here a year ago, happy that they are still around.  Everything is exactly as it should be. The owner is cool af.  Food is great.     Only complaint is the Ohio state rug that you have to step on to order.    But I guess that's what you would expect out of fans from\"the team up north\""}
{"text":"Oh my tummy is happy! My husband and son came here once before and raved about it. Tonight we all went. The handcut fries are perfect! The freshness of the Detroit dog definitely represented in the \"snap\" of the dog. Delicious! Staff was proud to serve these delicious dogs, super friendly and came to check on how we liked everything.   We will be back! Thanks Detroit coney grill for a delicious dog!"}
{"text":"Great food and a good atmosphere here, you can tell they take pride in where they are from and put forth good food. Everything is great on the menu!!"}
{"text":"The second time was even better!! I had their fries in addition to my coney dog and will definitely be back for a third time. The owner is extremely nice, the service is great and the food is incredibly tasty."}
{"text":"This place is great. Coney dog was on point and the Faygo and Better Made were an added bonus. The drive from N. Scottsdale was worth it."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday. I'm originally from Detroit and I love real Detroit Coney dogs. Only place I could get them was back in Michigan or to bring the ingredients back here to Arizona when I travel up there. These are real Detroit Coney dogs it was just like being back home. The food was excellent the service was great and the people are very nice. I had the Coney dog, Chili Cheese Fries and Faygo Rock & Rye it was so good! I'm so glad they are in town and I'm hoping they will open one in the East Valley. I live in Apache Junction and would love to have one closer to home but will definitely drive to Tempe if I have to. It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This is a great place downtown Phoenix to get a burger and fries without breaking the bank!  I always order mine to go and by the time I walk in it is ready.  You an put whatever you want on your burger depending on your taste for the day and the fries are nice and crisp."}
{"text":"Authentic coney's from Detroit! Yum! Service was fast and very friendly too. Wish we had one in Lakeway, Texas."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I haven't been back home in almost 20 years, but I'm at the point now where I enjoy DCG food more than the memories I have of loving Coney Islands when I lived in the D.   David has brought such an amazing piece of home with him and is kind enough to share it with all of us.  And now that it's just a few miles from my house in East Mesa...it's kinda like finding a unicorn."}
{"text":"Still love this place! Dave is what all business owners should be!! Absolutely the best restaurant in Metro Phoenix.  Time to come out East guys! Crismon and Baseline!"}
{"text":"This place is easy to overlook. Little burger place in a strip mall, like thousands exist all over the west. But man their burgers are amazing! Each patty is only 2oz but seasoned to perfection and cooked to sizzling and cheese dripping deliciousness. I can only imagine how glorious these burgers would taste drunk!  Definitely give them a try!  Great customer service, east coast Pop available, great family owned feel.  Edit: after receiving a message from the owner I decided to up my review from 4 to 5. I never give a 5 unless the combination of quality, service and ambiance is just amazing. The dedication and personal touch this place brings deserves it."}
{"text":"Detroit Coney Grill is amazing! I work right down the road, so it's becoming a staple -- especially when I want a fresh, delicious burger. They'll make it anyway you want. I highly recommend a triple with both cheeses -- top with lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and ketchup! So good! The Hani Pita is also delicious."}
{"text":"My Co worker and I are visiting from CA and decided to try out Coney Grill, and I have to say it was one of the dogs I have ever had. The owner David came and greeted us and the staff was great. If your ever near Tempe go try Coney Grill"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a recommendation from a colleague, I generally love finding the small \"out of the way\" places because the staff tend to be loving their work, and it usually shines through in the food.    Detriot Coney Grill easily lives up to the ideal, the gentleman at the counter was talkative and friendly, food was exactly what I expected.   And dont be afraid when you see that the burgers start at a double, the patties are on the thinner side so a double comes in just about right."}
{"text":"Bomb, but veeeeery greasy!  I ordered a cheese burger with grilled onions and mushrooms. The grilled onions were the best onions I have ever had in a burger, EVER. They were caramelized perfectly, sliced at just the right size, and had the perfect amount in the burger. I also ordered the chili cheese fries with shredded cheese. Everything was delicious and the workers were very lively and friendly. I couldn't finish my food and I was sad I had to throw away such delicious food because I was going to get on a plane a couple hours later. I would definitely come back again when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Flew in from Portland, Oregon with my daughter and two grandkids.  Was looking for a good place to eat. We found this place and was so happy we did. The food is magnificent, the best Coney Dog and fresh cut fries ever. The staff was friendly and the place was clean. The next time we fly into Arizona this place will be our first stop."}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm still hungry, the portions are large and the taste is good. This did in fact taste like a fresher, more meaningful Big Mac. The thousand islands has become a postmark to MCD. The fries are great and will definitely go there, the meat on the burger was thin, (it must be something to do with the custom) in not a big fan of that. But over all it was a great experience. I can wait to try the hot dogs."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot downtown! The food is authentic; \"the real D\". Service is fast & accurate; the staff is genuine. A real gem among the downtown landscape!!"}
{"text":"I tried their burgers today and they were great! Therefore, I'm bumping them up a star. The burger was delicious, and very reasonably priced. While I wasn't the biggest fan of the hot dogs, I will definitely return for the burgers."}
{"text":"We are from Detroit and were so happy to have this restaurant in our backyard!  Mark & Julie Scottsdale AZ"}
{"text":"First time at bat with Detroit Coney Grill place is very friendly with customers. Very tasty and greasy! But Hey... that's chili dogs and fries to be expected! Going back to try something else on the menu so far so good! Hope to hit one out of the park with there Gyro sandwiches. Yes I would recommend this place for burgers fries and hot dogs!"}
{"text":"My god why did it take me so long to find this place? With all the flavors of Detroit this is just like being back home. I love it! Stopped and got a Coney after I had already eaten because there was no way that I was going to let this opportunity pass me by. I ordered a coney and a Faygo rock-n-rye. It tasted just like I had ordered from duly's on w Vernor and junction. A true taste of Detroit indeed. Definitely going back for more. It's a must for true Detroiters wanting that true Detroit taste. The best part was meeting the owner and finding your he knew my neighborhood in southwest Detroit. I will be supporting this spot for years to come!"}
{"text":"Very good. I got the coney dog without onions and I really liked it. The hotdog has a good snap. The owner is very nice and there is a 10% check in on Yelp which is awesome."}
{"text":"Come here for an excellent hot dog or burger experience.  I found this place on Yelp as I was headed to the Phoenix airport and needed to grab a quick bit before turning in the rental car.  This place is about 5 minutes for the airport, so worth a stop if you want better than the captive airport food options.  And the price is super reasonable.  The chili on both the dogs and burgers is excellent, and the hand-cut fries are tasty when they are hot.  The staff are super friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend trying this place if in the mood for a good snappy dog/coney."}
{"text":"So good and affordable! Service was stellar, food was fantastic..A+++!!  If you are from Michigan, they have some cool shirts you can snag, as well. I'm not, but they were so cool I was tempted to pretend :) they also had some Michigan soft drink that the crowd seemed to love. This isn't a diet food place so don't go lookin for a low cal salad or gluten free nonsense!! Lol. They may have that stuff...I don't know, I was only there for the hotdogs, burgers and fries :)"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The food was fanatic, the service was amazing, the atmosphere is fun and I totally can't wait to come back. Open up a place in central Phoenix! The staff were super friendly and the price is really good for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"Holly crap was this good.  Coney Chili and fry's omg.  I ate 2 and went back for good measure.  I am stuffed and that is just fine.  The chili is the amazing.  The service was great.  The gal taking orders is so funny and calls you by name."}
{"text":"I came across this hidden gem by accident but definitely a great find. I've had the double cheese burger, Coney dog, chili cheese fries, and so much more. Everything is so flavorful and priced fairly. They even have daily specials every day! I cannot get over the Coney dogs, it's a must on your first visit! The environment is awesome; always an upbeat individual at the register and super fast employees on the grill. They open at 10:30 which is just in time for lunch rushes to begin. Especially given the area they are located (lots of business) Also don't make the mistake I did and show up on a Sunday, they are closed on Sundays :("}
{"text":"I've been back multiple times, also to their new location in Mesa and Detroit Coney Grill is good. I stick with my gut and order the Coney specials Everytime but if your craving a Detroit Coney dog, or haven't had one, you won't be sad.  Thank God for people that don't do disrespectful shit like put beans on my chili dog. I still think the fries aren't meant to be chili cheese fries but just get yourself here, eat, and be happy. I don't recommend the \"Hani\". That was the first thing I tried at a different location and was not a fan. I also appreciate that the first time I came to this location, my dogs weren't as hot as I liked, and rather than be annoyed or just throw together a new plate the owner actually went and double checked everything in the cooking process, held the cook accountable and made sure the replacements were done right, not just for me but for all customers. Eat here!"}

{"text":"Gotta love Yelp for amazing food recommendations. Found this divey little spot on our way to the airport thanks to fellow yelpers. We asked what we should try and we were told the burger because it's rated 9th best burger IN THE COUNTRY. So we got the double burgers and chili cheese fries. The patties are smashed to super thin and are seasoned perfectly. The buns are a perfect blend of crispy and greasy. Seriously mouth watering burgers. No wonder they are 9th in the country. The chili cheese fries were good, not really anything super crazy or special about them but I would definitely order them again. Kinda like carnival or fair chili cheese fries. Overall this spot is definitely as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Great coney's! Just like back home. Been coming since we found out about it and we're never disappointed.   Staff and owner are wonderful and welcoming."}
{"text":"Why did it take me so long to try this place! I miss food from home. Finally went yesterday had a Hani and some Faygo. Yum! I don't remember a Hani being so good (either been too long or it was really the best) I even got a new Spartan Tshirt. I almost went back today. 20 minutes is better than 2,000 miles!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Fries were good. Coney hot good was so so for me. I admit it's a different flavor and maybe I'm used to an all beef type,  but it did not impress me. Chilli was a real disappointment. I did not finish half of it, just did not like it. 2.95 for a snall bowl and again the flavor was unimpressive. Service was good and friendly.   I would drive 5 miles further to go to Teds Hot Dogs in Tempe,  but some people here obviously are repeat customers.   Overall I would rate the fries and service good. The chilli  poor and Coney dogs as so so at best."}
{"text":"I have had the burger again, and last time I was wrong. I assumed things about their cheese, and as it isn't my favorite they are more particular about their quality than I ever could expect. I learned that the cheese is local, a fact that I love, and made by Shrieber Cheese. But enough about the cheese - the final compilation is still a tasty burger. And i have enjoyed it.   I have come back a few times and at first it against my vote, but I fell for single majority. I had to give them a second third and a fourth chance and they have started to grow on me. I do still favor the the burger over the dog. That has not changed.   My hat is off for the persistence and the corrections. After each review I have been contacted by the owner, not requesting me to changed my review but correcting my wrongful assumptions and guesswork, and having a decent attitude while doing so. For this I am truly impressed, this is the way to go and the way to treat your customers. this is the kind of business I want to support."}
{"text":"One of my Facebook friends posted about this place and I really had to give it a try so I cheated a bit on my diet and headed over. The Coneys here are really great, I only ordered one because of my diet but I REALLY wanted to eat about 3 and add some of those chili cheese fries.  When I get back in better shape I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a couple of days and looking for something new to try... I found the Detroit Coney Grill on yelp and was very impressed by how good their hot dogs and burgers were... very good hot dog and really good fries... friendly atmosphere... nothing fancy but really good food!  I went twice in the same day... :)  San Clemente, CA"}
{"text":"Move over Ted's there's a new Hot Dog institution in town! This place is the real deal for a genuine Coney Dog. Detroit Coney Grill  is seriously  a direct vortex to Detroit. My husband is from Highland Park and he couldn't stop raving about this place and how much it reminded him of home. Although this place is newly opened they already have a devout following compliments of all the Midwest implants that miss Coney Dogs. I love that the kitchen is open and you can see the employees prepare the meals freshly in front of you. They also offer freshly cut fries, burger, gyros, and salads. On good days you can even get a Faygo Pop and Better Made Chips create  an authentic Detroit experience. The restaurant itself is a little small and warm but you'll enjoy all the Detroit décor and the friendly staff. This place will absolutely be a part of my lunch time rotation!"}
{"text":"Great food, Had the soccer game on top it off. I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Had the chili Coney and double burger with bacon and cheese.  Fresh, hot and tons of flavor. My own personal preference, I wish they had shredded cheddar cheese for the chili coney."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  Not the place to go if you're trying to eat healthy, but you will be pleasantly surprised.  Happy I finally tried it."}
{"text":"Great Detroit Coney. They have vernors, faygo, better made chips, home away from home. Its worth the drive. Chilli dogs are the best."}
{"text":"Love this place. Next to Heids Hot Dogs in Syracuse, best hot dogs I've had. The staff is always upbeat and friendly. Need to open in Gilbert, AZ...I'd be there weekly"}
{"text":"Awesome burger and the chili cheese fries are unreal. They make their own chili, fries, and grind their own beef into patties. Reminds me of food back home."}
{"text":"The new Detroit Coney Grill in downtown Phoenix sits in a location that as long as I've been here (circa 1982) has been called a \"Coney Island\" restaurant. I have worked or visited downtown for decades and I've eaten at all these other \"Coney Islands\".  The place has changed hands a bit. Here's the rub.... these places called themselves \"Coney Islands\" but they were never really or truly a DETROIT Coney Island restaurant.  Well it's taken a long time, but finally this place is now an authentic Coney Island restaurant.  We can all REJOICE.  When I order it's always the same.... \"one of each-extra chili\".  In my opinion it is the only way to go and this place delivers the Detroit home town flavor.  This is what you get.  A Coney Island hot dog is a hot dog with chili, mustard and chopped onions.  The chili should be from, or taste like, Lafayette Coney Island chili.  Most of the Detroit Coney's get their chili from Lafayette in the form of a frozen block of goodness that is reconstituted with water.  Sound's a little funky but it's amazing. I'm not sure if their chili is from Lafayette or they make their own, but in any event it tastes like the real thing.  This Coney is the real deal.  The dog had just the right amount of snap and was cooked on the grill just like they do it in Downtown Detroit.  I saw the grill marks on the dog.  It's authentic.  The other part to \"one of each\" is a Detroit-Loose-Burger-Coney served in a hot dog bun.  As far as I know you can only get these in Michigan... until this guy opened up in Arizona.  Nobody does these.  Do you want to know what this is? The best way to describe it is sloppy joe meat topped with chili, mustard and onions.  Again, I really enjoyed my \"one of each\".  See the pic. Don't forget the extra chili.  Finally, just to prove they are authentic, the place serves Detroit's own \"Better Made\" potato chips and \"Faygo\" soda. When I was a kid I used to love the \"Red Pop\".  They have all the classic flavors.  Michiganders should be thrilled."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times, I just don't get what the fuss is about.  Maybe it's just a matter of preference when it comes to certain things about hot dogs, but I'm not sure I'm a fan of the Coney dog served here.  To be fair, I've never had one before anywhere else, so I can't compare to other establishments.  The cashier was very friendly and she even read my name off my work badge somehow and called me by name the rest of the time I was there.  I think that's a really nice touch.  The owner too, he's such a super cool guy and I really want to like the food because of it.  I got a Coney dog with french fries that I added the option of putting Frank's Red Hot all over them.  I saw the new menu item, the big-mackinaw and had to try it also.  The dog - the onions had a really off putting smell to them.  I don't know if they were old, or if it was the way that they interacted with the chili, but every time I brought the dog to my mouth, I was grossed out by the terrible smell of the onions.  It almost had that B.O. smell of old onions.  The snap of the dog, I love a snap, but this was REALLY snappy, kind of felt strange to me.  This chili is OK, I would add more mustard personally  The burger - huge!  Cooked to perfection, melty cheese, and then....the onions!  Nooooooo! There were so many onions on this burger, it completely destroyed my palate.  All I could taste was onion.  While I was in line, I was listening to each person's order, and it seemed like they were all ordering with no onions.  I remember thinking, if you come to a place, order it the way they make it, they know what they're doing.  By the end of my meal, I realized why.  Maybe it's not why THEY ordered with no onions, but I certainly would order with no onion next time.  The weird smelly onions on the dog, and the way too abundant amount of onions on my burger were enough to wonder what the hype is.  If you love onions, come here.  If you don't, order without onions.  The burger and the personality of the owner and cashier were enough for me to some day want to go back and order with no onions."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, and very easy to drive by it. Slow down and look for this spot on the north side of Broadway in that little strip mall and life will be good."}
{"text":"Yasssss!!!!! We felt like we were back home! We even put our pin on the map of the city to represent where we're from! The owner is amazing and everyone here is so nice! From the greet at the door (no explanation needed of the menu when you're from Detroit)  His daughter Lilly made sure that the place was cleaned, grabbed our trays as soon as we were done and wiped off all the tables. The owner personally stopped at every table talking to newcomers and regulars alike.   They have all the original faygo flavors in glass bottles so they have a great crisp flavor. Not mention every flavor of a better made chips. I was a little sad that they didn't have my red pop but the owner assured me he order it and the guy that ships it dropped the ball (I saw the text message)  The food was phenomenal- Fiance got the quad burger with regular fries and devoured it, I ordered the veggie pita with tzatziki sauce and the Cajun fries (no ketchup needed). The only thing that could make this meal better is a nap!   Which is exactly what we are headed to do! We will definitely be back! Great job brining a taste of Detroit to the desert! Can't wait til they bring a location to the south side 32nd and baseline would be perfect"}
{"text":"Food was good and reasonably priced. Wait staff was helpful and kind. My only complaint is the place was absolutely filthy. The tables weren't wiped, the garbage was full with food all across the top, it looked like it hadn't been swept in ages and there was black stuff growing around the hoses that the beverages came out of.  I might go back for the food, but I won't eat inside."}
{"text":"Found this original Detroit style coney island, its just like Home the best anywhere in az. It taste just like being back in detroit at the coney islands, its a must have, must go if you are from Michigan!!! Friendly owner and staff they make like your back in detroit!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place 2 thumbs up.. pls come to the West Valley. We are ready for u in Glendale.. im off The 101 and Glendale.."}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon burger! It really just doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"Loved this place, great dogs.  Wonderful snap each bite.  Worth the time for a quicky bite.  Staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today after reading this place on \"Yelps top 100\". They were rated #30 on the list and after eating here I see exactly why! So much flavor in the food. I had a chicken philly pita and would recommend it to anyone! The owner suggested a coney dog and I had one too. First time trying a coney but it won't be my last.  The food didn't take long and the price was just right. I would recommend everyone to give this place a try! Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best hot dog I've had outside of New York ever. Great taste....real snap of authentic casing, caramelized onions packed with flavor. Fries are fresh cut. Friendly staff. Going back again this week"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that I haven't had a \"Detroit\" coney before but I have had coney's on the east coast and liked them much better. First, it was our first time in and the guy at the counter was not helpful at all. We could have saved a bunch going with the combo that we found after we ordered, he should have just said they had a combo with what we ordered. Also, we showed him our Yelp check in for the discount they offered and he didn't take the discount off after me asking twice because I thought he hadn't. I checked the receipt and nope no discount. The Coney was good but not great, there is a different spice I thought maybe like a curry... Don't know but it was different. Fries were decent but again nothing great. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but wouldn't complain if someone wanted to go. It was as the line says, Meh. It was also very warm in the restaurant and I am almost always cold."}
{"text":"Fantastic is the only way to describe this place! Coneys are superior. Burgers are good. Everything from Detroit. Love it!  Build one in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"If you've spent time in Michigan and enjoyed the Coney Dogs at American or Lafayette Coney Island there, then you will enjoy this place. It's real Coney Dogs with chili like you get in Detroit, a side of Better Made potato chips, and then wash it all down with a Faygo (which is a pop, not a soda). As someone who was born in Ann Arbor, attended Hillsdale College, and then lived in the Detroit area for a few years, this was a great reminder of what I liked about Michigan... without all the snow. Just a tip, feel free to have a conversation about the Lions, Tigers, Pistons, Wolverines, or Spartans, but don't mention Ohio State or Notre Dame unless you want to take a lot of abuse!"}
{"text":"Best place in Tempe !!!! I love the loose burger !!! Just like home !!! Best birthday dinner ever xoxox"}
{"text":"My girlfriend is a Canton, MI native and I've heard plenty about local delicacies. Detroit Coney Grill delivers: the coney dog was great, and they have a wide selection of Better Made chips and Faygo. As a current Tucson resident, I would love to see a location open in our University area. We both think it would be a hit, and I would have a place to fuel my growing Rock & Rye addiction."}
{"text":"Got a burger here the other day and it really was amazing. I was very impressed with the freshness of their vegetables and the flavor of the burger. Definitely will try again. Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"My Mom is originally from Detroit and loves this place.  It's a safe bet she'd give Detroit Coney Grill five stars easy.  She lives in north Scottsdale close to Pinnacle peak and when I'm visiting the Valley of the Sun we always make the trek down to Tempe to go here for lunch.  I've tried many of the offerings and will admit I do like the food here. Also, the service is friendly and fairly efficient.  However, for the price, and good business they do, for gods sake, hire someone to wipe the effing tables off!  My goodness, the owner should be embarrassed.  Every time I come here the tables are never clean!  It's gross!  CLEAN IT UP!!!"}
{"text":"The coney dog here is excellent. I love the combination of chili, mustard and onions and their chili is excellent. Their loose meat burgers are also really good and all their french fries are handcut and excellently cooked and seasoned. Even their chili cheese fries are solid. Solid diner stop, A+ all the way and a friendly owner who chats with you."}
{"text":"Very very good , fries are damn good to compliment some very tasty dogs and burgers. Gotta get the hot dogs I think they are unique and have a different taste compared to traditional Vienna"}
{"text":"I'm from Arizona and my boyfriend is from Michigan.  He of course is in love with Coney dogs when we went back to Michigan we ate at the two famous places there American and Layette.  I loved them both but for me it is the Better Made Barbeque Potato Chips.  I have always loved potato chips and I thought that I had my favorite until I tasted a Better Made so for me its all about the chips:)"}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to go for a real Coney fix.  The dogs have a nice snap to them.  The Coney sauce is nice and simple as it should be, and the fries are the real deal.  Anxious to try their burgers!  Easy to see why this place is successful!  Simple Concept that Northern and Midwest transplants to AZ will always support and appreciate!"}
{"text":"People who haven't been there probably don't realize that Detroit has its own type of hot dogs known as Coney's. It's basically a chili dog served with or without onions and covered in a specific type of chili that tends to be a little less meaty and a little more watery than you get in places like Texas. Other Michigan specific items include Better Made Potato Chips and it wouldn't be a fair representation of the Wolverine state if you couldn't wash it all down with a Vernor's Ginger Ale or a Faygo pop. While it seems like the Chicago foods tend to get all the love in the Valley, Detroit Coney is a nice change for anyone who's ever spent time in the Motor City."}
{"text":"The owner of this place is a hell of a salesman.  He believes in his product and obviously cares about the place and its origin, and I respect the hell out of that.  Recommended a flavor of pop (not soda, I learned) and was spot on.  The dogs were fantastic, the burger was small and simple and great, and that chili is killer.  This place is awesome."}
{"text":"It's awesome give it a shot. I drove past here everyday for a year thinking it would disgusting despite the food reviews. Hot dogs were good and i don't even like hotdogs. Like i said its worth a shot."}
{"text":"Came here just to grab a quick lunch. Chili dogs have always been my favorite and it's finally great to have found someplace that's has it. The dogs have this great snap to them and the chili was pretty spot on. If only they came to SF, it'd be a great place to just grab a decently priced hot dog and chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"We just heard about this Detroit-style restaurant, so  we drove from N. Scottsdale to try it out.  We are glad we did. We had the coney's and the burger.  Both were delicious! They use the chili made in Detroit and even stay true to the experience and serve Faygo pop and Better Made chips! It has to be expensive to ship these products here, but it is key to making this place authentic, nostalgic and true to the food! This one should be on your list of places to eat!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service! They even have sodas and other Detroit native foods! Whether you're from Michigan, or just a fan of great food, this place MUST be on your list. Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"This place Rocks!  I was expecting another \"Coney knock-off joint\" being from the D myself, I've tried most every \"Coney\" place I've found in AZ. I figured I'd stop in at the recommendation from another Detroiter in the valley and I'm glad I did!  The food is as authentic as it gets right down to the taste of the chili and the \"snap\" of the dog when you bite into it (ya'll know about that snap) and the checkered table cloths. Remember its \"pop\" in here and they have Fago and Vernors and the infamous \"Boston Cooler.\"   This place is a slice of Detroit Heaven in Arizona, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Back again, I think this is the 7th day this week and they are only open 6 days out of 7.. I feel like this is a home away from home, but the food is better (Don't tell my mom please) The customer service here is literally better then the service at any other establishment in Arizona, and that alone wins my business no questions asked.. I drive about 45 mins every time I eat here, multiple times a week, and I have never left hungry or unhappy.. If you like amazing, you will love Coney Grill!!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from the Detroit area (Southfield) now living in Chicago and this was a taste home.  Stopped in after we landed and stopped in before we left. BEST CONEY'S EVER!!!!!  We need one of these in Chicago.  Faygo Red Pop, 2 all day with everything and chili fries with everything is the ONLY way to order your coney's.  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Coneys.  I have been told that the fries are spot-on Detroit-style fries by natives.  The staff is always friendly and welcoming, prices are reasonable and they do have a few \"value deals\" available.  This would be a 5-star review if they had beer."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Not only do they check in on you to see how you like your food but also engaged in conversation about Detroit. So my mom, my boyfriend and I went here after we saw it when we went to Hummus Express (which is also great). My mom got the coney combo and Cajun fries (says they are really spicy just to warn ya), I got the loose burger which is a burger that's kinda in the witness protection program as a hot dog and it was super juicy and delicious. My boyfriend got the quad burger which he polished off pretty easily without complaint (picture included in my check in) he was so happy that he got to build it himself basically."}
{"text":"Best hotdogs in town.  Owner is hilarious and really makes you feel welcome.  This is my new favorite place for hotdogs and hamburgers."}
{"text":"First of all would like to shout out to the whole freakin store for a fantastic job in customer service. Seriously! From the moment I walked in the staff was extremely nice. Now to get down to the review. I ordered the infamous Coney meal. The price is reasonable, good for lunch a meal. The food came out and OMG. From the in house made chili, the PERFECT snap and juiciness from the hotdog all the way down to the cheese.... I've had a lot of hot dogs but man! it was delicious. The meal came with two coney's and FRESH potato fries. When I say fresh, they chopped them there and fried them there. Extremely happy with this place. The food was good, the service was exceptional. Defiantly will be coming back."}
{"text":"Native Michigander living in AZ. I love, love, love  coney dogs. I miss coneys, purple cow, better made, sanders, etc. I live in Glendale, AZ. I saw DCG on  Facebook Friday night and decided we would head over there for lunch the next day. I've tried coneys before from a restaurant that sold itself on food from back home. We tried it and weren't impressed. So, I was skeptical. I ordered 2 Detroit coney dogs, a Rock n Rye Faygo and coney fries. I also knew  (from  Facebook) there may be Superman ice cream in the near future...if it wasn't already all sold out. The coney dogs tasted a little bolder than I remember. But, I also tasted memories. So,  these coney dogs passed the taste test and ripped my skepticism into teensy shreds of nothingness. The Faygo pop was awesome as always. To wrap up my time in coney heaven, I ordered Superman ice cream and a Faygo pop to go. The ice cream is exactly as I remembered. My better half had never had this ice cream so we shared the ice cream. He loves it.  Btw, customer service is top-top-top notch. This place is worth the 30-minute drive each way. Perhaps some day it will come to the West Valley. If/when it does, I'm a be a regular. I  DCG."}
{"text":"Good food! Taste like the real Detroit Coney Island! Good customer service from Crissy! We'll definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Every time I go back home to Michigan I make it a point to only get food that I can only get in Michigan. It's still weird not to have Coney Island on that list but I'm definitely not complaining! Plus, the owner is SUPER nice!! I hope he opens more around the valley since I'm in central Phx. Plus, ASU downtown (where the cool kids go) would totally eat it up! Rush hour traffic pretty much stops me from going M-F, so that really only leaves Sat:( I could probably eat chili cheese fries everyday. Let's be honest, as a teen I totally did;)  And to the few people on here complaining about the prices, seriously??? We go here with my other friends from Michigan and the 4 of us for $24. Pretty cheap for such deliciousness!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. The workers are nice and inviting. The faygo pop is a nice touch. I got the coney special and fries. The dogs were not bad, but I would not go out of my way to get them. I prefer vienna beef hotdogs which these are not. The fries are different, again not great but not bad. It was an okay lunch."}
{"text":"Once again DCG did not dissapoint. From the hot dogs that snap when you bite them, to the coney sauce that covers everything with goodness. This place is a mainstay.  If you are from the valley..you owe it to yourself to try the food here. Grab a Faygo..a loosie and some Bettermade chips..savor each flavor and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice find thanks to Yelp. Really enjoyed the burgers, chilli and fries.  Had the double but next time will be ordering the quad. Would be satisfied with just the fries and chilli because I really enjoyed dipping fries into the bowl of chilli. Hot dogs next visit!"}
{"text":"These are probably the best coneys you can hope to find outside of Detroit. The chili is made from a secret recipe and is perfect. The hand cut fries are among the best around. And the fresh made burgers are a depiction of the finest burger I could ever hope to eat anywhere. Detroit coney grill is not only a solid 5 star hot dog joint, they are also a solid 5 star burger joint a rare feat indeed."}
{"text":"This place is great. Clean little restaurant with fresh, good tasting food at a reasonable price. If you are visiting and looking for a good hamburger, hot dog or fries, this is your place."}
{"text":"If you've experienced A Detroit coney, you would understand. Arizona has needed a real coney for a long long time. The dogs are shipped from Michigan and they serve a mean hani.   The owner is great and makes sure everyone has a good experience there. I would highly recommend this place anyone and everyone, especially if you're from Michigan."}
{"text":"Wait.   Yelp told me this place had Faygo AND Vernors.  It's TRUE!  They have a fridge of Faygo.   Coney and chili cheese fries were delicious! Love the atmosphere. It's like a little bit of the D transported to AZ."}
{"text":"I just moved from Michigan to Scottsdale two months ago so I was excited to find this place.  I was extremely underwhelmed.  In Michigan every decent coney place uses a Dearborn, or Koegels sausage (unless you are American or Lafayette).  The sausage was alright but not authentic.  The buns were hard and the chili tasted canned and bean based.  I wouldn't go back.  They however do have Michigan T-shirts and Faygo."}
{"text":"From the second you walk in you feel like family. The owner knows everyone who has been in before, even if its been a few months. The best hot dogs in town and damn good messy burgers too! Honestly just wish they had one in Mesa. But the drive is worth it for those perfect hot dogs with a snap! You can always tell the good places by the line out the door during lunch hour. But dont let the line scare you, they'll get your order out quick and it's still worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yummy! Yummy! Highly recommended.  The decor is fun and lively. The owner is friendly. I'm from Chicago so this is my first taste of a coney...delicious."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite burger joint. Fast service, friendly staff, but the food puts it over the top. Great burger with fresh toppings, lots of food for the price. French fries were great. My buddy got the chili fries and coney dog, both looked amazing, he confirmed they tasted as good as they looked."}
{"text":"Finally!  A real Detroit Coney.  A hot dot with a snap, perfect chili and real Vernors and Faygo to boot. Now we have to get them to open another farther north for all his many fans that need a fix.  Taco Haus, 7318 E. Shea, has closed and would be ideal for us hungry fans.  Add your voice to a new location!      Linda K."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Detroit and had the pleasure of eating at DCG last week.  First off, I had to actually call the restaurant to see if I was dreaming... c'mon, a REAL Coney Dog in ARIZONA!!!

GREAT JOB DAVID!!  NOW WE NEED AN AUTHENTIC DELI FOR CORNED BEEF PILED A MILE HIGH ON REAL RYE BREAD!!  hint hint David Anyways PLEASE PLEASE tell all your friends wether they are from detroit or not, school newbies on the way of the coney!!  Lets keep this place open forever!! Rudy Jerome AZ"}
{"text":"We from Detroit and was looking all over for a real coney spot and we found it.... food was great and they had Faygo Pop and better maid chips hopefully they can put one in Goodyear Arizona Love it"}
{"text":"The guys here at DCG have some serious passion for the Coney Dog and the action they have going on is pretty cool as well. Inside is full of fun items to make you feel like you're back in the Detroit area and then some. Take your time and check out the walls.  I've never been to Michigan but do love THE DOG. Been here a couple times and usually order a couple of their famous Coney Combos. Even broke down and had to test out some of the Chili Cheese Fries. Nice!  Really like the way the Dog pops in your mouth as you bite into them. The Hand Cut Fries are made fresh to order and you can definitely tell the difference. They also have Burgers, Pitas, Salads and boneless Chicken Wings as well.  The food is pretty good and most people seem to rate this place rather high. I'm inclined to go with an A-OK since the Chili or Coney sauce just did not have much of a thrill factor or flavor profile for me and the hotdogs are little on the pricey side.  Give them a try and see what you think. This is one of those regional flavors that you are going to enjoy more if you are from that area. I tend to lean toward the Windy City when hankering for a special treat. BEEP BEEP!  3.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Was welcomed as soon as I came in the door, real nice guys.  Really good hot dogs that look as good as they taste.  It was a nice touch that they followed up to make sure I was satisfied.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is IT!! If you go anywhere else for hamburger/hot dog/just great food, you're making a mistake. You REALLY really need to check this place out. Outstanding food, outstanding service, the best place going in the area. I've eaten here a few times and brought new friends with me each time after the first visit. None of them were disappointed. Give it a chance I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do."}
{"text":"FINALLY! a true coney island in Arizona! Anyone from Detroit should definitely visit! The food is amazing and they have FAYGO pop! (yep, you heard me, i still call it pop!) The guys working there are super friendly and nice. THANK YOU for bringing a real coney island to AZ! :)"}
{"text":"If you're familiar with authentic Coney Dogs from Detroit, these are EXACTLY on par.  They even have BetterMade chips and Faygo soda (although I'm personally not a fan of Faygo).    One of the truest tests of authenticity is that they even have the Hani on the menu.  There are claims of opening a new location on Bell & 35th Ave soon.  Would love to see something along the Tatum corridor nearby PV Mall for all of us Scottsdale/N. Phx folks!!!"}
{"text":"This place is solid.  Really good coney dogs and then you do the combo with the ground beef and sauce on the hot dog.  Friggin' awesome.  I get it every couple of weeks to-go for lunch as I work nearby.  The people are great and they aim to please.  Food is awesome...definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Great coneys! Chili , mustard and onion - just the way I like 'em. Very friendly staff. The fries were great also. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"BeSDT place in the entire world.   You should definitely come eat here because it is great food, great service, and isn't a place you will find anywhere except here and Detroit itself."}
{"text":"This place is so nostalgic to me.  I am a Midwestern transplant so I was brought up on Coney Island hot dogs and loose meat sandwiches (aka Maid-Rites).  My job is right smack in the middle of central city so I went out looking for a new lunch spot and I found it at Detroit Coney Grill.  The staff was very inviting and answered my questions. My first time  I ordered 2 Coney dogs and their raw-cut fries.  Both were top notch, the chili was great, the dogs were perfect and the fries were awesome.  What's even better is they have Faygo pop, so I can eat my lunch with some Redpop or Rockin' Rye.  I even take a few bottles home for the future wife, who is also a Midwesterner-turned-desert-dweller.  I've also tried their loose meat sandwiches.  It did strike me as odd that they served them in hot dog buns, but that didn't matter, the meat was perfectly seasoned and the chili is a nice addition.  Just make sure you use a bib or don't wear your good clothes when taking a bite or you might be wearing some of it.    All in all, this place espouses the greasy spoon mentality of 'It ain't healthy, but it sure is good.\" So don't expect low-calorie here, just savor the doggy, meaty, chili goodness and have a Faygo to go with it.  The only knock I can give to this place is it is tiny.  If you catch the early part of the lunch hour you can usually find a seat but it fills up fast, there's not much in the way of seating and when you load up on people it can get a bit stuffy.  I've dined in and taken-out and usually I just take it to go.  Price-wise, this place is pretty decent given it's location.  Many downtown Phoenix places are pricy, but this place is reasonable.  You can get a pretty filling lunch for around $10 and with a multitude of specials and even a rewards program you can get good grub for cheap.  If you find yourself downtown, definitely stop in, you won't be disappointed.  For you Midwestern transplants, this is a taste of home that you won't soon forget."}
{"text":"5/28/16, I ate there for the first time.  The double cheese burger was good not better then in & out burger but pretty good.  The curly fries were very good, you can't get those at in & out.  What I like best was all the variety they have.  Next time I'll have to try something healthier.  They have a grilled chicken avocado salad that looked really good.  The owner/ manager was very friendly checking with dinner's as to how their meals were tasting."}
{"text":"Authentic Detroit coney dogs!!! From the coney sauce to the \"snap\" dogs this is the real deal!!!! Takes me back to me teenage days!!  If you like coneys this will be your favorite place to get a coney from now on!"}
{"text":"OK, I'm originally from Detroit and this place is pretty close to the real thing.  In many ways it may be better because the amount of hamburger they use in the chilli.  My only knock are the hours, it's only open during the week for lunch.  I live downtown and I would love to see the hours extended, especially now that there are so many people moving downtown with all the apartments being built.  I think this place could even be open late on the weekends with all the night life downtown too!  Would be great food after a night of drinking!lol."}
{"text":"Had a double burger, and it was more like a single from how thin the patties. Good taste, but a little greasy. Friend had hot dog and enjoyed it. Fast service, small quaint place with a couple tables inside and a couple outside."}
{"text":"We took our sons and a friend for a 16th Birthday dinner by request from the Birthday Boy.  My son really wanted to go because they are the only place that serves Faygo that we have found in the area.  We all walked in to a very packed whole in the wall.  The place has a great atmosphere and the gal at the register greeted us immediately.  She was very patient as three teenagers and two adults ordered half the menu.  We had a great time, the food was delicious, and everyone was completely satisfied when we left.  The boys even got to take home extra empty Faygo bottles.  Don't ask me why, I didn't bother asking them why....lol"}
{"text":"A great meal and an even better experience. Nothing beats the Coney dog and chili cheese fries, except adding some Rock & Rye Fargo! I feel like family when I come here!  The only thing that would make it better is a location in Gilbert! Then we will really be family!"}
{"text":"Just ate there coming from Cali returning to Texas. Best decision ever. Owner was awesome and even gave us a free coney dog because he knows that it's the bread and butter of his business. The Quad burger with cheese and bacon was one the best burgers I have ever eaten. Need this place in San Antonio on the far west side as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"So many wonderful reviews on here, and I expected differently. The atmosphere of the place is a very welcoming one, but it does get a bit too hot with so many people and the kitchen being right in the entrance (which is fine because usually what's done in-front of you tends to be so much better). Never had been here before but decided to try it out, and I ended up getting the daily meal; drink, two hot dogs, and fries. Fries were unsalted, hot dogs were too chewy, and I didn't get my drink. I'm almost thinking maybe I'm not the at ordering at this place, but from what I experienced it want that great anyways. ."}
{"text":"This place will never disappoint anyone! The food is fast and is amazing. Super munchy food! This is a great place for college students and or families. I would love to live closer to this place!!! This is a must try place"}
{"text":"Had to check it out last week for lunch being from the D! Not bad dogs.. coney is good., they have Fargo rock n rye !! And Vernors in the bottle !!!  Enough said -  great little place guys are working hard to do a great job!  prices are decent , I'm coming back got to support the small guys brining something new to the valley!"}
{"text":"First time visiting today. You want a good hot dog? How about a great Coney Dog?! This place is legit and reminds me of places in Detroit and Toledo. I used to work at Charlie's Coney Island in Toledo. Absolutely awesome flavor and snap to the dogs. I ordered the special with hand cut fries. Wow . I ordered two Coneys to go and ended up eating them there. Today I was a pig and I cried on the way home because it was so good. Best Coney Dog I've had in 25 years!"}
{"text":"I just finished the best darn burger I've had in my life! Do yourself a favor, get the QUAD burger, 4 meats 4 cheese, their patties are very small and thin so 4 patties equals to about a single patty frm other places, but its VERY well worth it. Seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the loads of melted cheese... MMMM...I have 2 days left in Phoenix and will be coming here twice a day till I leave.  Thanks  Detroit Coney Grill, for ruining burgers for me everywhere else I go. Nothing compares."}
{"text":"Bomb food!! Sadly, they were out of bacon but it was no biggie! They were pretty nice and asked us how the food was once we got it and they made decently pretty quick! It's a good thing I don't live super close because I'd have a problem with coming here often!"}
{"text":"Just because its named detroit coney makes me smile and I love it!  Nothing beats a detroit coney!  And yes arizonians.... coneys come from michigan!  not coney island! :)"}
{"text":"I am from Detroit. I moved to Tempe two days ago and this place is a little slice of HEAVEN!!! All my local home food...they call the pop, pop and not soda...better made chips, Faygo pop....I will eat here more than once a week."}
{"text":"This place is to die for I've been going here ever since they open and I will never stop going David is a good friend of mine so I will always be there"}
{"text":"A little taste of home! David and his staff are amazing! I even walked out of there with a free shirt to represent this amazing place. I hope to see you guys in Gilbert! GO BLUE!"}
{"text":"Let me say first of all that it takes an Oakland A's fan some time to wind up the ability to speak highly of a Detroit Tigers fan, but this place is awesome! WARNING! The Coney dog is addicting...you've been warned by me and several posters around the restaurant. The owner Dave is colorful, approachable, and loves to greet his customers and he makes sure personally that your order was higher than expected. I enjoy an owner who involves himself in his work and wants you to experience the same bliss that he has while cooking it. Remember that Detroit Coney Grill was voted #30 in the Top 100 restaurants in the United States!"}
{"text":"I herd about this place from a friend an me being from Michigan I had to try it out. It was a little far for me to drive coming from Mckellips and Linzi but it as well worth the trip the food was made fresh and the taste brought back so many memories. I got the Detroit combo chilli dog  and it was great you won't be disappointed. Don't forget to clean your feet before you sit down to eat or walk out the door."}
{"text":"Stopped by during the lunch rush and was sadly disappointed. The line was extremely long so we figured it was good otherwise people wouldn't be waiting. The inside was hot, too warm for comfort. We opted to sit outside. When we got to the counter to order the man was taking my order, talking to the kitchen, handing out a to go order, and talking to another customer. It's not wonder why when I said pickles 15 times he never heard me. I ordered one of the burgers and it was a small patty lost in a big bun that helped to absorb the grease. Save yourself time, money, and a bad experience and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere with very friendly staff. Great to have Detroit food out here in AZ, especially coneys and Faygo pop. Coneys are BOMB! Fries dont look great, but are tasty. Havent tried anything but the coney special so far (2 coneys, fries and drink for $10)."}
{"text":"Awesome service the owner is extremely friendly and makes sure things are done right! Awesome coney dogs and burgers. Definitely check this place out when in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Chilli was slightly cold. Fries had a couple of spots they weren't completely cooked through at. Faygo bottled is $2.50. Chilli Cheese fries $3.95, Coney $3.95. Prices are high but you pay for the novelty. I don't have an issue with that. Only solid complaint is food temp & the fact that they close so early. 7:30 is early!  :) The staff is UBER nice.   Went back today 10/18/2013 and everything ws cooked to perfection. I got coney and chilli cheese fries. Great job!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of home! I only wish there was brown gravy for the fries, and a flint style option. Hands down best place for a dog in the valley. My family back in Michigan don't have to worry, when I'm sick, I'll come here for a vernors. Lol   P.s. The owner is a sweetheart and works the grill! You'll enjoy giving him your business Michigander or not."}
{"text":"So I haven't been to Michigan before which I suppose is where coney dogs are very popular but I was just about underwhelmed by the food here in almost every way. As far as the coney dog itself I really liked the chili that they put on the dog and of course the dog itself is quite tasty. Other than that I thought it was nothing too special that I couldn't get anywhere else. The fries did consist of huge portions but other than that they were fairly bland tasting.  It could just be me but I really don't understand all the great reviews and hype surrounding this place. Perhaps it's because I haven't had this kind of hot dog before but I feel that there are plenty of other options within the area for food. Having tried Ted's Hot Dogs before coming here I would rather go there instead and they also have better fries there.  I honestly do feel bad going against the many positive reviews on here but there was nothing much here than made me want to come back again."}
{"text":"Tried this out for lunch , Veggie pita with Greek dressing and some spiral cut fries. Loved it. Definitely going back. The hand cut fries were better than the spiral but both good. I liked the family business atmosphere and the quick service"}
{"text":"I've been reading all the reviews about this place, and had it bookmarked for months.  Well, on Saturday Mr. M and I felt like goofing off and driving around aimlessly and I decided to go on a hot dog tour.    We started here and decided to adopt the attitude of \"when in Rome\" and ordered what appeared to be the house specialty, The Detroit Coney Combo with the hot dog and onions and mustard and chili and the loose ground beef all in one big pile of goodness.    First, the dude working the register has more patience than I ever would because first timers have no idea how to order here and it can be a little overwhelming in the beginning.  We got to listen to him explain things a couple of times to the group in front of us, so when he got to me, I was ready.    We shared the Detroit Coney combo and the fresh cut spiral cut fries, which come in a huge serving by the way, and I'm pretty sure they sprinkle them with crack because those are totally addictive!  Fried perfectly and absolutely delicious.  I was a little nervous that the onions and chili on the combo would come back and haunt me later, but they did not.  Everyone played nice in my belly and the whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable.  Combo, fries, and fountain drink was $9.18 with tax.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is the best hot dog and burger joint in AZ.  A must visit.  This place makes the hot dog gourmet.  And the loose meat burger is outstanding.  Fresh cut fries, can't be beat."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Loads of flavor in the chilli. All the employees rocked! Had the hotdogs, but next time it's going to be a burger."}
{"text":"Ive been working on Central Ave for a while now. And I've had Coney Before. But this location, The counter girl had some \"TUDE\" today!!! And it was all made up when I bit into the triple burger, OMG!!! One of the best burgers ever!! Chica can keep her attitude,  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Just got in from Nashville and found Detroit Coney Grill. Nicest people and best coney and chili cheese fries I have ever had. Was planning on In and Out but these guys had better reviews and now I see why. Need one of these in Nashville!"}
{"text":"It should be clear by now that dieting was not amongst my New Year's resolutions.  If it had been, then Detroit Coney Grill would be the type of place where you would give said diet the middle finger, kick it while its down, and even yell at it for good measure.  Fortunately my stomach and I were in agreement that this spot was on the to do list for 2017.  DCG's flagship location in Tempe has been a wildly popular spot for locals and ASU students alike for years.  But it wasn't until they opened their second location in Downtown Phoenix that I had them on my radar.  It's a Monday through Friday lunch only spot (which is a little annoying) so I haven't had many opportunities to look this place up.  However as today was a holiday for me, it was time to finally take this hot dog journey.  The restaurant is located on the northwest corner of Central and Adams, in what can be described as a pretty nondescript sector of Downtown.  Not a huge amount of foot traffic through this area after 5pm so I sort of get why they do lunch only.  The place has all the elements of your standard burger and fries joint.  Order at the counter, grab your drink, unpretentious furniture, and even some sticky spots on the floors (no doubt the result of numerous spilled sodas).  What stands out here though is the almost religious devotion to making the food and drinks taste like home for Detroit expats.  According to the guy up front, almost all of their ingredients (the beef, the hot dogs, and even the Faygo sodas) are shipped in from Michigan.  Having never set foot in The Great Lakes State, I'll take their word for it.  Let's get to the food.  For my first venture here I went with the menu item boldly listed as their house specialty.  A Detroit Coney Combo.  A Detroit hot dog covered with loose burger meat, their in house coney chili, mustard, and diced onions.  Also got a side of fries and a bottled water.  Total cost including tax:  $10.  As I was one of only a few patrons on this holiday Monday, my food arrived on my table in about 2 minutes.  As I said earlier, I'd never had an authentic Detroit Coney hot dog before in my life.  I now see what I've been missing.  This thing is a dietician's nightmare and messy enough to where you'll probably have chili on your fingers and palms.  And it's worth every penny.  Juicy, meaty, flavorful, delicious.  If my cholesterol wasn't a concern, I could eat these all day.  Whatever trouble DCG goes through to get their stuff from the Detroit area, it's pretty clearly worth the trouble.  A side note that I didn't care much for the fries as I thought they were overdone.  I like my fries to be crispy on the outside and a little chewy on the outside, but these were the potato equivalent of a well done burger.  A relatively small blemish on the meal, but worth noting.  If you can't make it to their Downtown Phoenix location for a weekday, they are open for dinner (and on Saturday) at their Tempe location.  And per the manager they're opening a third location in Mesa pretty soon.  Great value, tasty ingredients, affordable on any budget.  Vegetarians and dieters, steer clear."}
{"text":"As i'm from Michigan this gets a bonus star. The food reminded my of home, but the Diner didn't. I'll go back again, not every week, but once and awhile."}
{"text":"Exactly like the Detroit experience! Enjoyed the food and excited about the restaurant being in Tempe!"}
{"text":"In terms of fast food, I really enjoyed the service and food options. However, because of the cost and yelp reviews, I had some pretty high expectations for the portions (yes, that is very American of me to complain about). I split a coney combo (2 chili dogs and fries) with my husband about $10 total). While that's a pretty great deal compared to other places, I am spoiled by the $1.50 hot dog combo at Costco. Accordingly, I expected a hot dog that was Costco-food court size and I expected more chili. The hot dog itself was fine, but again, compared to Costco, I found it to be higher on the processed-food taste than I expected. That said, it was PACKED with happy customers and I still plan to try out their chili cheese fries soon. So, even though I didn't rate a 4 or 5, I would still recommend experiencing this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome...a taste of back home...been out here 28 years....now we need one in Tucson...Go Wildcats"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place, and you love coneys, no frills, delicious food, friendly service, then this place is definitely a must-try. I'll be honest, the restaurant is not the cleanest, but it's not bad either, and it's that type of atmosphere that gives it that ambiance of great classic food. The links have a nice snap to them when you bite into them. The chili is very good. And the fries are great. When you just want some good comfort food, this is a great place. I'll be going back for sure.   Don't forget to check-in on Yelp."}
{"text":"Burger was good.  Fries were ok.  Service was ok.  Worth a second trip.  Didn't try to hotdogs."}
{"text":"Love this place reminds me alot .of home but this place has it all .. great food great service"}
{"text":"From Mesa on Higley and Brown. Best damn dogs you can find outside of Michigan. Worth the drive, wherever you are from! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best place    I am from Detroit so it's great to have a place that I can go to when I need some comfort food from the motor city!!   Love the coney dog!!  and faygo... I have sent most of my friends by to get a coney!!!"}
{"text":"Most restaurants can make a lasting impression because of the negative. This place is pretty much the opposite. I had a friendly conversation with two of the employees, ate a pretty good burger and hand cut fries, saw countless people come through to get great food and walked out with the owner knowing my name. Wow. Few and far between have I found a place like this. The Midwest is in my roots and I'm proud to say this place keeps it real for every person who walks in."}
{"text":"This place is the best. The food is great, I had the \"Big D\" and it was the best burger I ever had. The fries are delicious, Super man ice cream and vanilla float are out of this world. The atmosphere is just like walking into a friends house and watch them cook for you."}
{"text":"So delicious! Felt like I was back in Michigan! Owner is awesome, service awesome!! I will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Second visit.  Had a triple with a side of fries.  Outstanding, but I recommend you get without seasoning and put your own salt on.  Service is a bit spotty."}
{"text":"Family owned place, owner on premises, food is ridiculously good. Went with guys from work, took my family back the following weekend. The owner walked my wife and son through all the options and took the order.   Did I mention it is ridiculously good?"}
{"text":"This is a good place in theory, it looks and smells like a coney island back home but the taste fell flat. Not to say it was bad because it wasn't, but the flavor was a little bland. The coney dog didn't give me the pop of a good hot dog, the bun was good, the chill was alright and the onions were fresh but every thing together was just okay. I think I would go back for the chili cheese fries if I was craving them, I liked those better then the coney dogs. Overall I would say, good effort."}
{"text":"Delicious burger! I had the Big Mack Inaw. It was seasoned well, hot, cheesey goodness. My son recommended this spot and said the burger was the best he's ever had and he wasnt kidding! I can't wait to come back and try the hot dogs."}
{"text":"Awful chicken strips ... had frozen after taste. The fries were sad, worse fries ever. They weren't cooked all the way"}
{"text":"The burgers come fast and are cooked immediately. They absolutely melt in your mouth. The beef is sourced from Detroit. I can see why the burgers are rated 9th in the nation by food network. If you're looking for something different this is not it, but what they have done is perfected their burgers. I also had their coney and it crunches in your mouth when you bite into it. The fries are made out of actual potatoes and not the sorry frozen and mushy excuses for fries you see at other restaurants."}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah I thought when I first heard and walked into Detroit Coney.  There have been a few pretenders in Phoenix before but I figured, why not?  Detroit Coney is the real thing!  Why go all the way back to Lafayette Coney Island (or American if you're one of those people) when Detroit Coney is here?    GO!"}
{"text":"Very good! Reminds me of the Coneys in the D. Now they just need to add wing dings to the menu!"}
{"text":"Better Made chips, Faygo pop (not soda!), coney's, chili cheese fries! This is a fantastic taste of home."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. The big mackinaw. The end. Highly suggest this place. Very friendly and fast"}
{"text":"Been to the one in Tempe once loved it but it is not convenient so I can't tell you how happy I was when they opened up the new place near my office.  Been there a few times and I always get the Coney Dog and Chilli fry's (no cheese I don't think that part is authentic) and washing it down with a Faygo Rock and Rye.  Life does not get much better than this. Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is top notch.  The owners were in there chatting up a bunch of elderly people who were in AZ from Michigan.  Food was great and relatively cheap.  I recommend getting \"One of Each\" and grabbing a side of those salty fries."}
{"text":"I got a triple burger with grilled onions and cheese.    It sound like a lot of food but it's not.  That because the burger patties are only 2 ounces each.  With 3 patties you are only looking at 6 ounces total of meat.  I want to come back and try it with four patties.  Can't wait!   Also, what makes this burger so tasty is the meat patty is ground daily and not ever frozen.  That's the niche of this place!"}
{"text":"Best coney and cheese fries I've ever had!! Fries are made from fresh potatoes.   Excellent service!"}
{"text":"**now this is what i'm talking about**an authentic coney island in az**the food was awesome**we will be regular customers for sure**"}
{"text":"So good!!!!!!!! Like the best coneys eveaaaaaaa yall needa trythis you would honestly not be disappoint ed its really really bomb . com"}
{"text":"We had the Wednesday 2 Coney Dog special! It was good and the lady was very sweet and helpful since it was our first time visiting!"}
{"text":"The loose meat sandwich comes on a hot dog bun with really good flavor. The burger was Delicious and juicy! Get it with bacon and cheese for a real treat. Onion rings were a hit too, my husband says they're \"to die for\". Service was awesome! Both Cristy and the owner were informative and friendly.  The rock n rye FayGo was delish too. A big extra big star because they not only had iced tea (I don't drink soda), but it was very fresh. This is hard to find in many mom n pop type restaurants. Who am I kidding, it's hard to find in big restaurants too. The quality is much appreciated by this tea toddler.   Now we wait in the hope they open one in the SE side of Gilbert ...although the gym might need to become even more frequent if they do!"}
{"text":"Had to try Detroit Coney Grill after trekking all the way out from the Arrowhead area of Glendale to Tempe. David is a great PR man but those chili cheese coneys didn't really need any PR. Great homemade chili and dogs with just the right amount of snap. We definitely need one of these restaurants in the West Valley! (Maybe on Bell Road off the 101 Loop? Or better yet, 67th Avenue off of the 101 Loop? Hint, hint David!)"}
{"text":"Their coney dogs are the real deal! Washed mine down with a delicious Faygo--the owner is so nice and chatted with us while we watched a Tigers game. The chili cheese fries are hand cut and really good too. I only wish they had a location in Mesa!"}
{"text":"So obsessed with Detroit Coney Grill! Being from The suburbs of Detroit, I know a good coney, and they have a great one. They even have great options like the Coney burger: 3 patties, loose meat, chili and a hot dog. Touchdown!!!"}
{"text":"Felt like I was back in Detroit!  Great food, great service!  Expand to South Mountain!"}
{"text":"After a lovely day of training in class for the private TSA friends introduced me to Detroit Coney Grill - Being a Detroit native I was excited to go there for my first time.  I enjoyed the best priced and quality Lamb Gyro I've ever had in AZ.  Thank you Detroit Coney Island, Tempe, AZ - I'll be back SOON!"}
{"text":"Thank you for bringing a real coney dog to AZ!!! I feel like I am at home! Love all the articles about Detroit and the map where we can pin where we are from! The dogs are great because he gets them shipped from home. Will be back very soon! I hope they can bring one to Maricopa!"}
{"text":"Dave is amazing! He brought the authentic coney dog to Arizona!!! I'm at McDonald and Scottsdale Road and would LOVE an Old Town location! Also, please bring the Sanders hot fudge cream puff to the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here drinking a Vernor's in a glass bottle while eating a Hani at a Coney Island  ...and I ask you: is that last sentence the most Detroit thing you've ever heard, or what?  The food is delicious, the Hani was at my table faster than it ever was in Michigan.  I can't say how nice it is to have this place in town.  The only downfall I see to it are the hours.  Like a lot of places in this part of downtown Phoenix, it closes once the employees at the local office buildings are done with lunch.  It's such a shame, because I think that it could do so well at night if there were a bar it could partner up with in the area."}
{"text":"I found this place randomly one day looking for a place to get a burger. I came in and the people are super friendly and very helpful helping you choose what you want to eat.   I've had the burger there (they grind their own meat) and it was one of the best burgers I've had. I went back on a later date and got the snap hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut and it was delicious.   I went today and got a chili cheese snap hot dog and it was amazing as well. The fries were crunchy and delicious. The staff comes to make sure you're enjoying your food and your stay. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good burger or hot dog.   And this place doesn't only sell hot dogs and burgers, but they also have gyros and salads. So they have something for everyone. When you get the chance or are in the area, I recommend you stop by and get some friggin phenomenal food."}
{"text":"A great place to visit whether you're from the mitten and missing home, or wondering what the mitten has to offer. Fresh food - Amazing service - Tasty Food - Fast service. Defiant return will be in order."}
{"text":"The Coney's are simply amazing.  I love the crisp break you get in biting into the hot dog.  I love watching them cut my fries to order."}
{"text":"Tried this place out at the recommendation of a friend from Detroit because they would know a good Detroit coney better than me. The fries are alright and next time I'm skipping them and just getting coney dogs because they were delicious and I wish I had eaten more than one. Lol!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. So glad I live so close to a place where I can get a real coney. The staff is very friendly and seem to want to be there. Service is incredibly fast even when it's packed"}
{"text":"I crave these dogs! !! Been here many times since first visit and the experience just keeps getting better. When ya get to know the staff,  it's like coming home. ... great people,  great food, great ambience. I LOVE THIS PLACE !!!"}
{"text":"Burgers were just ok you have to order the triple to feel like you have meat, and fries were really nothing to brag about.  Says they are made and cut in Detroit and then shipped.  I can see so many problems with that if true."}
{"text":"You can immediately taste the flavors of Detroit at this place. From the POP to the coneys it is amazing. We will be coming back often for sure. If you are from Michigan / Detroit you must try this place! Feels like home sweet home. We came from the west valley (sun City area) and it is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Best coneys and fries......EVER! The guys that work here are super nice. Tony (i think) was my cashier and he was very helpful and patient. Prices are good and the food is even better. Will b back."}
{"text":"We discovered this place during Phoenix Comicon. It is delicious! I can't stop thinking about the Philly Cheesesteak Pita. Please open a location on the west side. 99th avenue and McDowell would be PERFECT. You would see a lot of traffic!! Definitely from myself, and many others I recommended to. The current locations and hours of operation make it almost impossible for us to be able to come by."}
{"text":"I was having major hot dog cravings this week. I was let down by another local hot dog place and was about to head to Sonic for a freaking plain dog. Good thing I was at a work conference nearby. I yelped locations close by for lunch  I was excited to try this place after the disappointment I had earlier in the week. I was so satisfied and happy with my experience I might go back tomorrow! I don't know much about the coney culture behind the place but even just as an average customer I would return again.   I got just a plain coney with chili, onions, and light mustard. Hand cut fries and a drink. All of it was simple and tasty as f**k!! My dog was great; a little messy, but still great. The fries were fresh, hot, and salty! YUM! It was perfect and it was what I wanted, and it was cheap. I was also greeted warmly, and had three people check in on me to make sure I was enjoying the meal. And thanked as I left. I felt super taken care of."}
{"text":"Good Detroit Vibe. Conies were on the smaller side. Price on the higher side. There are several daily specials so be sure to specify which one you want. Mine was $10.49 vs. $7.99.  Good eats and definitely close enough to the Dbacks and Suns for a pregame meal."}
{"text":"Best food value in downtown Phoenix.   Came in for the ucla game and ended up eating here twice because I liked it so much. The downtown location is cozier but it's in such a nice location it doesn't matter (plus it's got a great outdoor patio) I had the open face chili burger \"hot dog\" (no hot dog in it). The ground beef is fantastic. Nothing dirty, greasy, or over cooked. They've got the awesome modern Coke machines too. Simple great Detroit food!"}
{"text":"Best dog in the West  I'm from LA but I came out to Phoenix for a football game. I'm sure glad I decided to eat a dog before the game. Their hot dog is all beef imported from Michigan (which sounds unnecessary but based on the taste is worth it) the dog itself has a nice tact on the outside but is totally juicy on the inside. The chili and chunky onions are simple and perfect. Also, their owner Dave is badass and rotates between their locations daily.    Better than Pink's DTLA"}
{"text":"Just left there with a full tummy and a giant smile. Those native AZ ppl have no idea what a coney really is. This place is the best and is a must to experience!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Doesn't feel fake. The food is great! Found my new hot dog spot!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food - I'm from Michigan myself and I enjoy a classic Coney meal. David's Detroit Coney grill did not disappoint. The girlfriend and I had the chicken hani, loose hamburger, coney dog, French fries, Faygo root beer and boxed water! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"What an experience in Detroit hot dogs and soda. We stopped in here for lunch on a lazy Thursday afternoon and it was pretty good. The staff was courteous and helpful as they assisted us in picking the best dogs for our tastes.   I got the every day special (2 dogs fries and a drink for $10) and the wife got a loose burger. Both were spectacular. Honestly a hot dog is a hot dog to me but what made this place was the fries and the burger. The fries were fresh and cooked perfectly. The loose burger was well flavored and presented well on the bun. I have always liked loose meat burgers and this one did not disappoint (from what I could steal from the wife).   The place is small and not fancy but it is a hot dog joint so can't fault it there. If you are looking for a filling, cheap and tasty lunch give this place a try."}
{"text":"Detroit coney grill is so dang good. The coney fries are my absolute favorite. Can't go wrong with the coney dogs either (definitely order the 2 coney special). Last time I was there I decided to switch it up and got the double cheese burger. The burger patties were so flavorful and everything tastes fresh. Now I won't know how to decide next time! They also have lots of health conscious options. My friend got a pita and Greek salad and was really pleased. The owner and staff are so nice and constantly check on their guests. It feels like walking into someone's home the way they greet their customers. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and son brought a hot dog last day, they were eating there and they liked a lot! the hot dog was great, so we went there again and get a long hot dog it was great, but I still prefer the smaller, the service y so kind and good, is clean and smell great"}
{"text":"So legit it makes u feel like ur back in Michigan. Great food!!!!!!! I absolutely love it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't give out five-star reviews without very good reason.  With that said, this joint deserves 6 stars.  Been going here regularly for the last year and the owner is great.  Frankly I don't know his name, but every time I show up he finds me and gives me a fist bump and says \"good to see you again!\"  So much for me trying to go incognito.  The best thing on the menu are the burgers (triple with American cheese and everything except mayo and ketchup please).  In short, I don't think I can go to Five Guy$ or In-n-Out again after getting used the burgers at this place.  The fries are great as well and always cut in-house.  They also just got a Coke Freestyle machine if you're into that.  I suggest if you frequent this place that you join their \"five star\" club (ask them about it)."}
{"text":"I'm a proud Michigander who has lived all over the country. I'm always in search of Detroit style coney, and rarely have I found any place outside of the great mitten that can even come close. Luckily, I've stumbled across Detroit Coney Grill in Tempe. I ate here for the first time this week and it's the real deal! Faygo pop(not soda), Vernors, and Better Made are all well represented here, but the story is the coney dog! First off, they get the chili right, and if you're a fellow Michigander, you know the difference. The dogs have natural casings that snap but aren't chewy, and the buns are steamed. I had a coney dog, chili cheese fries and Rock N Rye, spent less than $10, and came away with my faith in humanity restored! I plan on becoming a regular and brining my family soon."}
{"text":"Well, it finally happened. The Burger Guy found a burger in Arizona so inspiring it's motivated me to come out of hiding. In case you're wondering, which you're probably not, because you live in AZ and likely have no idea who I am, but if you were wondering... I moved to Phoenix, AZ five years ago and retired the LA Burger Tour. I may resume it one day, as I still hear about new awesome burger places in LA I haven't tried. Anyway, on to the review!  The Burger - 9 (out of 10) As previously mentioned, the Burger Guy has lived in the Phoenix area (the Valley of the Sun as it's locally known) for five years, and you can bet hundreds of Phoenix burgers were consumed in that time. Well folks, I can confidently and definitively say this is the best burger in the Valley, (Ok ok well it's my favorite at least). Often the best burgers need the fewest words, so I'll keep the description short. These are almost certainly the thinnest burger patties I've ever come across, and I'm sure that is part of the magic. The bun, meat, and cheese all come together in perfect harmony, and I would say the key word with this burger is cohesive. The flavors just blend together wonderfully. Get it anyway you like, but I strongly recommend the triple. It's the perfect meat to bun ratio. The Burger Guy likes his with both kinds of cheese, bacon, grilled onions, lettuce, pickle, and the holy trifecta of sauces (one of the few burgers I like ketchup on). This may be my favorite basic burger in the world!  If you get a chance to meet the owner, David, you will see the passion that is behind this truly special burger. The whole staff is awesome and will make you feel like a welcome friend.  Phoenix Burger Tour (Burger rating is out of 10. Ratings are for flavor of the burger ONLY, and other factors like ambience, service, and price are not considered).  -Detroit Coney Grill 9  The burger at DCG is so good it's inspired me to do a Phoenix Burger Tour.

{"text":"Detroit Coney Grill deserves 10 stars... Some of the best food in Tempe right here. Obviously this establishment is known for their  coneys, but let me tell you, them burgers will go toe to toe with some of the most proclaimed burger spots in the valley. Highly recommend the newer menu choices, such as the \"Big Mack-inaw\" which is their spin on the big mac, equipped with 4 thin beef patties, 3 pieces of bread, and some of that *secret sauuce*. \"The Big D\" is another local legend which is pretty much a blend between a quad (maybe a triple i forgot) burger loaded with chili. Lets just say you'll need a fork and knife for that one. Apart from the great food, the owner always is there to enthusiastically greet you, ask you how your day is. Nothing is better than an establishment where ownership genuinely cares about their customers. Keep on doing your thing Coney Grill."}
{"text":"Born & raised in Michigan  This place is on point with their food it taste just like back home  I had Chicken Tenders with hot sauce an cheese fries sooo sooo good !!! I would recommend this place to any1. I've bn in AZ now off & on for the past yr. This has bn the best place for food I've tried yet  Hopefully I will b returning soon nxt time that I am in the Tempe area !"}
{"text":"Normally the food is a five-starrating but today I came by and you can definitely tell the owner is not in, it's obvious someone forgot to season the meat"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for coneys.  Best in AZ and in a blind taste test I bet you'd have trouble telling which chili was \"made in Detroit\" and which was made in Tempe.  Even better they do not short you on the chili.  They provide enough to where it overflows just a little bit with each bite.  Additionally, they also give an ample amount of chili on the chili fries so that you don't have all the ones on the bottom without chili.    My only complaint, if you can even call it that, were the fries themselve were not exactly like you'd get at a coney in Detroit.  This is not to say they are not good...because they are very tasty...they are just different."}
{"text":"Food is pretty average. I really enjoyed their fries. They are extremely yummy.   Customer service is AMAZING! I will be a regular customer just because of it. They make you feel at home.The manager is very friendly and approachable. Nice to have people that still care about their service as much as the food.   RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Being from Michigan, I decided to try this place to see if it met my standards for a Coney Island.  I was impressed.  This was the best Detroit-style Coney dog I've had outside of Detroit.  They also had Faygo pop and Better Made potato chips.  Prices were very reasonable too. Next trip to Phoenix will include a stop here for lunch!"}
{"text":"Now that we live in Gilbert it's nice to get a taste of home! By far the best coneys in the area. David was more than welcoming, great service and great food."}
{"text":"The coneys are comparable to Lafayette or American Coney Island.  This Detroiter  was surprised to find such a good coney in AZ."}
{"text":"The owner is awesome.  Always friendly and makes sure you get what you want.  Great, fresh burgers and coneys.  You won't regret going there."}
{"text":"I live in Chandler, Az.  My fiance has been raving about this hot dog joint for months now. Finally he took me here earlier this week.  First thing I noticed is how friendly and upbeat the guys are that work here. (Owner perhaps, super nice. Even came by our table to make sure everything was to our liking) I ordered a double cheeseburger and my guy had a Detroit coney combo. Man, they were both awesome! I loved the crunch the dog had and also the chili was amazing! The burger was delicious too! We will definitely be coming back. Hopefully they can open a new joint up in the Chandler area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came in on a Wednesday for the bogo Coney special. It was awesome. They were extremely busy but the food came out fast and delicious. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Food is great!  Service is even better!  Very friendly establishment.  I appreciate great customer service.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix for the first time and needed a good lunch spot that was close to my hotel. This place had good reviews on Yelp and seemed unique so I gave it a try. I got the Detroit coney combo which was the Thursday special. They were pretty busy since it was about noon when I arrived however the order taking process went quick and smoothly and my food was ready just a few minutes later. I requested no mustard or onions and to my delight, they did not mess this up. The dog was delish and the addition of the chili and ground beef really set it off. The fries were a bit well done to my liking however everyone prefers their fries a certain way so I didn't let this bother to me. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience and I would definitely Detroit Coney Grill to a friend or fellow yelper."}
{"text":"Growing up in Detroit's I would go to a Coney Island a few times a month. Having lived in Arizona for 20 years I've never been able to find an authentic Coney Island hot dog until yesterday. Both my wife and I said after taking our first few bites this is exactly how I remember it. Hot dog, the chili, the atmosphere it's like being in downtown Detroit all over again"}
{"text":"Thanks to the cashier I didn't make the mistake of going with a double burger. She informed me that the triple is about the size of a regular burger. She was right on the money. The burger was delicious, I also had fries(they are steak cut style). Pricing was not too bad for downtown. I will go back to try the dogs next time."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Fresh Cut Fries. Just wish they spent their slow time doing some deep cleaning In the dining room. Walls were grody, framed pictured had stains  over the glass."}
{"text":"We LOVE the Tempe location and were super excited to hear about this new one in Mesa. It was fantastic! Food was just as awesome and even faster due to no crowds! Only a matter of time until this place picks up though."}
{"text":"The food here is very good and the service is great but they often get the order wrong. Multiply times I have had missing sauces or things added to my food that I did not want like onions or other ingredients. Just double check your order before you get take out."}
{"text":"I feel like when I write a reviews it's usually because I didn't like something at a place but I can't say that about Detroit Coney Grill. I freaking love coming here David who I believe is the owner is awesome, very friendly and always very attentive. I usually order the chicken buffalo pita... easily one my favorite dishes here. I have order the burgers too which are very tasty.   Overall the food is great. I would actually probably pay more if they raised the prices. People/Staff are awesome!"}
{"text":"Drove up from Tucson. Great Coneys and Faygo too! After finishing off the Coney dogs, we had to go back and try a \"loose\", which is a hot dog bun filled with loose hamburger meat, and topped with chili, mustard and onion. It's a Detroit specialty!  Reasonable prices. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Love the owner, very welcoming place. Burgers are SO good, coneys are outstanding.  Even if you're not from the mitten you can appreciate a good hot dog! I go all the time.  If you try em out, get one of each!"}
{"text":"Good place to get a Detroit Coney dog in phoenix!!!! I even placed a pun on their board to show where I am from. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start. The coney dogs are great!  The hot dogs are very good and the chili has great flavor. I did the Coney Special and it included 2 coney dogs, a boat of fries, and a drink for $8.88. Tons of food. Super cheap.   The Better Made Honey BBQ chips rock. They are soooo good. I love them. I looked on the package and they are made in Detroit.   My husband had a Philly cheesesteak pita. It was freshly made and tasted so good. The meat was cooked perfectly and the flavors commingled together very well.   My only complaint is that they didn't have tea. Said they didn't have tea bags. I already purchased a drink and had to go and purchase a bottle of water too."}
{"text":"Great new food spot in the hood for serious eaters and foodies. More of this, less Wendys, Burger King & Mickey Ds please!"}
{"text":"My husbands family is from Michigan and this was a nice little piece of home in the Arizona desert!"}
{"text":"Poor service and quality of food. I was very disappointed by lack of organization when I placed online order. Kitchen area visible to customers was filthy. Cashier and prep cook was rude. I will buy faygo soda from Bev Mo instead of ever visiting another Detroit Coney Grill in Phoenix area"}
{"text":"I had a Coney Dog, Coney Dog Combo and Chili cheese fries.  All were good, but I didn't find it outstanding.   The dogs themselves had good snap, but together with the chili the favors seemed lost.  The chili cheese fries were ok too, I prefer shredded cheese to cheese sauce - buts just a personal preference for me."}
{"text":"I love coney! I'm from Detroit and have been to many coneys in my life. The chili here tastes great and I love the fact that you can get Faygo pop & Better Made chips. Reasons for 3 star: the hours aren't that great. The thing I loved about coney back home is that many of them are 24 hours and coney is the best after the bar. 2nd reason for 3 star is I'm not a huge fan of the fries. This would be ok if I could buy the chili, but the \"bowl of chili\" on the menu is dine in only, so you're forced to eat their fries if you want chili cheese fries. I mean I understand you may not want your chili put on other peoples' food but what does it matter if I spent my money on  *update: I never said I liked frozen fries like David N. assumed in his reply to my review. I would rather cook my fries at home."}
{"text":"Wow!! I ordered the 2 coney special with chilli cheese fries and just wow!!! Best hot dog/coney place in town. They chilli and steamed bun are perfection. The staff was friendly and fast. Next time I'll try their burgers!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant little place! I had the double w/o cheese and it was good! But u think I'll get the quad next their patties are pretty thin but very yummy. And they are so polite! Will return if I'm in the area :)"}
{"text":"Best place ever! If u really like the foods, come here. If u like Detroit, come here!"}
{"text":"Coney burger - A loose meat triple and Coney with chili and cheese... Excellent! Plan on a nap shortly afterwards."}
{"text":"Great burgers and coneys.  Angelica was a super hostess.  Will be back thanks again.  Love the faygo and better made chips.  Outstanding cheese fries. Dave you rock"}
{"text":"love your coneys and fries.        just like being back in the mitten.    love Detroit but grew up closer to flint so im used to flint style.  next time im close to downtown will stop by."}
{"text":"So I am Originally from The Chicago area and my boyfriend wanted to check this place out and out of all the failed attempts of Midwest foods in the Phoenix area I was afraid to come but my fears slowly went away when David the owner of this awesome restaurant said pop and not soda and actually pronounced my name right. Everything here is the best of the best and if you're from the Midwest.... You need to come here. Hell even if your not this place needs to be checked out. I had the Mondays Special and it was so freaking delicious. I live in Mesa off Alma School Rd and I hope there will be one closer in the future so I can walk there everyday."}
{"text":"Phenomenal would be an understatement!  The food transported me back to Detroit and was delicious.  We have lived in Arizona for 4 years and have missed having real Detroit Coney Dogs until we found Detroit Coney Grill. David made us feel like we were back in Michigan and truly put a huge smile on my 16 year old daughters face when he sat a bowl of Superman Ice Cream in front of her.  We live in Avondale and it was worth the drive and will highly recommend Detroit Coney Grill to our friends and family!  Can't wait until David opens a location closer to us!"}
{"text":"Honestly, no complains. Dogs cooked to perfection. They had great flavor and a very nice snap to them. Fries were very tasty and it was easy to tell they were fresh. Steamed buns so we're good there. Saw a few people eating the burgers. The patties looked really thin but the people eating them seemed to be enjoying them.  I enjoyed my Detroit dog (chili, mustard and onion), fries and creme faygo. Babygirl loved her dog, fries and grape faygo. They passed the princess test so there's something to be said for that. At 3 years old she's plenty picky!   We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great place.  More of a 41/2.  Came in a couple days ago and had the special of 2 coney dogs and a drink for 8-9 bucks.  Also ordered the loose meat sandwich and chili fries.  Everything was awesome.  The natural soda brand from MI they carried was outstanding stuff too.  Of course, they call it pop.  The owner and staff were super nice guys and we look forward to going back.  They're thinking about opening another location so hopefully it will be in Gilbert near San Tan Mall.  Hint hint.  We live right by there."}
{"text":"We just found this place and it is delicious. Great prices and friendly and attentive staff. We would love to have you come to Maricopa."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...I just don't get all the rave reviews here.  The food just doesn't seem to rate it, especially at the prices charged.  We came here because we were in the area, wanted some lunch, and YELP has this place at over four stars.  Reading the description I knew this was hotdogs and burgers, and so that was the expectation I went in with.  I wasn't thinking this would be Vintage 95 or the Cordon Bleu or anything of that sort.  It's dogs and burgers.  I get it.  Upon entering we were greeted immediately by either a manager or the owner.  Not sure which, but he acted like he was an owner.  He was very friendly and told us to let him know when we were ready.  So far no problem.  We settled on the daily special (today was two Coney dogs, a fries and a drink).  The Coney dogs are chili dogs, which is cool.  I like chili dogs!  We also got a double burger.  The manager/owner was very friendly, was focused on us while we were placing our order, and even made suggestions.  I took one suggestion and upgraded the fountain drink to one of his craft sodas.  He gave me the soda immediately, and it was really good.  The rest of the order came out pretty quickly.  The chili dogs were chili dogs.  They were fine, but nothing super-duper-fantastic.  Certainly better than someplace like Sonic, no doubt.  It sort of reminded me of the sort of chili dog you might get at a sports stadium from the concession there.  No evidence there was anything special about these dogs (e.g. all-natural, uncured, etc).  They could have been Ballpark Hotdogs for all I could tell.  The fries were basic, but good.  The hamburger initially came out with mayo on it.  We said to hold the mayo.  I don't know who made the error (and I don't care), but the young man I flagged about it seemed a bit surly and annoyed.  He replaced the bun and lettuce, but it seems like such a huge imposition for him.  A stark contrast to the older guy (manager/owner).  The \"double\" was indeed a double, but both patties were very very thin.  Total weight maybe 1/4 lb (and the owner even confirmed this when I asked).  So how did it taste?  Like a stadium concession burger.  Maybe a bit better than that.  But no match for other burgers I have had lately (such as Rocket Burger in Chandler).  I would probably rate the food at 2.5 stars.  It wasn't bad, but I have had better.  It was \"OK\".  I'm bumping to three stars for the very enthusiastic and concerned owner (he asked me a few times how things were), and the good craft sodas they have.    They also are overpriced for what you get, but the specials do help a bit (and there is a YELP check-in coupon).  They beat the heck out of McD's or similar, but they also are a lot more expensive, and frankly not as good as some other burger/dog joints I've tried."}
{"text":"So darned good we had to order more food. Wish I was still hunger so I could eat it all over again"}
{"text":"This place specializes in fantastic hot dogs and burgers. It's a small / modest place with a lot of heart. Detroit-themed decorations adorn the walls. And in my experience the staff has been not only courteous and friendly but seems legitimately interested in building a relationship with its customer community. This is a gem."}
{"text":"This is the place to go to get your fix of Detroit favorites. Coneys, Faygo, Vernors, and Better Made. The food is awesome and authentic to the Detroit style. The staff is awesome. If tou are missing your fix of coneys or never had one before, this is the place to go. I would give this a full 5 stars if they also served served Sanders Hot Fudge sundaes  it would also help if they were open later...could really take advantage of the late night college crowd down the road."}
{"text":"I love Detroit coney grill! Not only is the food amazing, the service is incredible! The owner is such a sweet guy and he's hilarious! I love the \"mom and pop\" feel of the place even though it's in the center of downtown Phoenix. I've been to both the Tempe and the Phoenix locations and I love both!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to take my dad here because he's from Detroit and always talks about \"real\" coney dogs. I took my mom and dad here today and the food was amazing but the service was even better! They def make you feel like family! We tried a little of everything. The burger was so fresh and juicy, the chili cheese fries were amazing, the coney dog and gyro were so good. We've already called our family to send them over!"}
{"text":"Detroit Coney Grill proudly displays their #30 on Yelp's Top 100 plaque from 2015 on the wall. It is easy to see why they made the list: cheap prices, quick service, and good food -- win-wins in any Yelper's book!   The smells coming of the grill are downright intoxicating. Even the kraut gets a turn on the hot top before making its way onto your Plain Coney Dog.   Sodium watching friends beware, though, this is not the place for you! The skin on hand-cut fries are sinfully bathed in salt. But they are tasty and I ate them all up! A $6 meal well-worth it!"}
{"text":"I just ate lunch here today and I'm not impressed. My burger was red on the inside which shocked me because the patties are so small. I also got fries which were dumped in a brown bag and when I pulled them out the bag was dripping in grease. Almost half of the fries were still raw potatoes. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"I was told (w/confidence!) by Crissy that a DetroitConey was better than a hot dog. Her confidence was well founded. I ate it in spite of the little chips of onion I spotted in the chili w/Gusto! Great customer service from the crew. Worth a return visit &exploration of menu items."}
{"text":"Now that I can get an authentic Hani in Arizona, there may not be any reason to visit Michigan!  Tastes just like the real deal!   And LOVE the decor! Really makes you feel at \"home.\"  Hope you open a location in Scottsdale soon!"}
{"text":"Super friendly owner and staff...great Coney dogs...good curly fries...highly recommend the red Faygo, delicious..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  It's close to work so we ended up getting take out here 3 times in 2 weeks.  The burgers are phenomenal!  I haven't tried the chili dogs yet but that's next on my list.  These guys grind their own meat for their burgers and they also have hand cut fries.  Everything I've eaten here is delicious.  I am not usually one to jump on the idea of getting burgers because I'm really picky with red meat being under cooked but this place has fabulous burgers and they're never under cooked.  Burger patties are thin so I usually get a triple and it's the perfect size. Looking forward to getting lunch here again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Temporary fix for a Midwest staple. I've been here in Arizona for a little over 5 years . Moving from Detroit I stayed eating at a Coney Island at least one meal of the day. So when I heard of the Detroit coney grill I was very excited, an to find out that they were getting their chilli from one of the best if not oldest coneys in Detroit, made it Mir appealing. When I told my wife that there was a coney in the valley we decided to check it out. When we made if to the location I knew I was in the right place. Several people leaving the place with their Detroit tigers fitted I felt at home for a quick second. The vibe inside was nice, some photos on the wall of certain Michigan team an a few other things Detroit. So now we get to the food which is really the reason that we came. Unlike most of the other people who have given reviews I was somewhat unimpressed by the menu as well as pricing an hours. Understand this, I am Detroit in every way shape an form. I've said on many occasions that if there were a coney out here that was exactly how we have them back home you would have a winner. Although the food is nice here, it's menu is missing so much that would make this a great place to go. I don't want to just go to a spot because its reminds me somewhat of home. And I think that this is what's happening with this place. So many people from Michigan have moved out here to the valley that anytime that you hear of anything from home you want to check it out. Coneys are a 24/7 grill with sooooo much to choose from on the menu you sometimes stand at the counter trying hard to make a decision on what to get. Burgers an coney fries are nice however just a scratch of the surface. And 2 bucks for a faygo is highway robbery, especially when you can go to certain qts or circle k's an get a 20 oz for 1 buck. The guy told us that they charge that much because it cost so much to send them out here. I know some may see this as a raggin rant, however it's not. In order to stand the test of time with a business you have to look at everything your patrons are saying an try to make adjustments. If not that same thing can turn around and bite you. Hopefully this is just a start to a great establishment in the valley. I'll be back to see if anything has changed. #whatupdoe"}
{"text":"Amazing I love this place!! I came from buckeye to enjoy this delicious meal! The owner a good guy"}
{"text":"I thought the food there was average. We got chili dogs and mine had the burger meat in it. The wiener itself was super average and most disappointing were their fries. I eat fries maybe once every two months so I was looking forward to them. Maybe I shoulda tried the Faygo drink... They were real friendly so I gave em an extra star."}
{"text":"Had two coney dogs and cheese fries. It taste just like they do in the D! Coming from Scottsdale and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who's used to the coneys in Detroit and surrounding areas. Food was amazing!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is amazing. This place is a must try if you're in the Tempe area"}
{"text":"Perfect stop for lunch before heading out!  I was in the mood for a sandwich or hot dog and came up on this place.  The coney did not disappoint!  The staff's friendly personality was nice, too."}
{"text":"I'm quickly becoming a big fan of this place, and the guys behind the counter. They're always super friendly, and willing to answer any question you might have. Pretty sure they're all from Detroit, and they're not shy about it.   One key thing about this joint is that they make their own dogs and grind their own meat, and they're proud of it! As well they should be. Their dogs are awesome, with that *snap* you look for in a good coney, made from real meat (no \"lips and assholes\", as my partner puts it). I had a burger the last time I was in, and it was damn good. The patties are small, 2-3 oz, which is why their burgers come in double, triple, quadruple, etc sizes. The only complaint I had was that my bun ended up kind of soggy within a few minutes, which is a pet peeve of mine. The fresh cut fries are great, and you can throw toppings like chili and cheese on them.   If you're looking for a good, authentic Coney Dog, with some Faygo Red Pop to go along with it, this is your place! It's definitely our go-to hot dog joint now."}
{"text":"Well the name of this establishment says it all for me. Detroit Coney Grill is awesome and the owner Dave is the TRUTH......wohoooo. The wife and I went here for lunch this past Monday and when I walked in I IMMEDIATELY loved the place. Dave was wearing a Detroit Lions shirt.....another staff member was wearing a Tigers Visor.....and we showed some mad love to each other over that thrilling comeback by the Lions over the Dallas Cowgirls.  Enough about that though let me talk about the food.....first of all since I don't eat red meat.....I decided to try there buffalo chicken pita. Let me tell you people it was the BEST buffalo chicken I have EVER tasted. I mean it was soooooo goood because they use Franks Hot Sauce and that makes all the difference in the world. Now for those of you who haven't spent anytime in the Midwest there are 3 things you must try if you ever visit that part of the country.  Franks Hot Sauce Better Made Potato Chips Faygo Soda Pop  They sell all of these items at the Detroit Coney Grill.....I was truly in heaven on Earth. This is establishment has been open for only a couple of months.....but I am really hoping Dave can get a spot open over here in the East Valley. So I need all of my fellow yelpers to pay Dave a visit in Tempe.....enjoy the food.....even if your not a Detroit sports fan.....LOL!!!! Then get your fannies back here on YELP and show Dave and the Detroit Coney Grill some love so we can get one here in the East Valley......wohooooo!!!! Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Quite a good Coney, homemade chili sauce with mustard and onions.  Fresh cut fries to boot.  Good Wed. Lunch special 2 coneys, regular fries and fountain drink for $8.88.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent \"coney\" style Detroit dogs. Decent sides like fries, but their food is not as good as Ted's (I guess that is the standard in Tempe). If you're from Michigan, then this place might be your spot, very authentic but if you're not nostalgic then try some place better."}
{"text":"This place felt like home with the greeting to the end of our meal, service is friendly and made me feel like I'm back home in Michigan. I ordered the loose hamburger coney and I ordered my friend a coney dog.. He loved it - considering he is a native in AZ, and he fell in love with the cream soda from Faygo!! I had to get my Vernors !! Everything tasted fantastic!! Hands down - love this place - wish their was one closer to me in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been here several times now, and I have to admit that it is addictive and you should eat at your own risk lol. Let's start by saying that the owner Dave is a amazing guy and definitely treats and runs his business phenomenal. He has been there every time I've been there so that alone should tell you something, he greets all of his customers as he would his family with respect. And that goes a long way in my books. Now let's move on to the food... I have had almost everything on the menu and let me tell you it all is prepared exactly how it is supposed to be AMAZINGGG. My favorite is the Big D with a coney, You really get the best of both worlds with that sandwich. With my culinary background as being a chef let me tell you, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BETTER MYSELF AND THAT'S THE HONEST TRUTH!!!! I wanna finish off by saying thanks to all the staff at Detroit Coney for giving me and my family a wonderful experience every time"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! Great food, friendly staff, good value. Only knocks I have are the place needs to be larger and the self service area could be better. But that's a problem in a lot of places."}
{"text":"Within the restaurants of a 5 mile radius from where I work, Detriot Coney is one of the most delicious, cheapest and offers the best service.  I went there for a dog but I saw someone eating a juicy burger so I changed my mind.  Drink, fries and a delicious cheeseburger for all under $8 bucks.  The person who took my order explained that my burger order number will be called out and then they will ask me what fixings I want \"like subway\" he said.  I thought that was a pretty cool feature and they had a nice selection of burger toppings.  The guy who cooked my burger, served it to me at my table and then cleaned up my table when I was done, what a superstar employee.  I'm giving this place 5 stars because it was clean, the service was awesome and the food was very delicious.  For a hot dog stand this place is a cut above the rest!"}
{"text":"This place was so amazingly perfect! You see, I moved to Arizona from Michigan about 5 years ago. Don't get me wrong, I love my new home, but every now and again I get very homesick and depressed. Oh how I have missed Faygo, superman ice cream, better made chips, and coney chili. But luckily for me I found Detroit coney on a recent visit to the Phoenix area. This restaurant is a delicious little slice of home! I stayed here over an hour enjoying the food and reminiscing over all things uniquely Michigan with their owner. When I tasted the chili, I (no joke) started to feel misty. I could feel tears of joy well up in my eyes. It was perfect, all the food was perfect! 100% Detroit flavor. I will certainly return the next time I'm in the Phoenix area.   P.s. the owner said he was toying with the idea of a second location in the Tucson area, which is where I live. I live near Wilmot and speedway, and if he opened a location near me, I would be there all the time!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for lunch whether you want to get out of the office for a bit or just swing by and pick something up.  I had the Gyro Pita, and it had been so long since I had an awesome one.  Nice fast service especially for those of us that work downtown and may not have a lot of time to spare."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Chilli cheese dogs are the best I've had. Extremely friendly staff. Faygo Pop. Live on Ellsworth and Southern. Worth the trip every time."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Lets just say for the price it is not a place I would come back again. I got the monday special $7.99 comes with a drink, coney dog, and chili fries. Then I added cheese to the dog, which I thought it came normally with for $0.50. I got the food and asked for hot sauce which was another $0.50. I mean come on guys, now you are starting to sound like my cable company. The hot dogs are made with Vienna Beef which is the kind of beef I try to avoid. The chili was not bad and the french fries were good. The best thing about this place was the customer service was good and when I paid with my card they didn't ask for a tip."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the chili dog, but the chicken in the chicken salad was really tasty and moist. The best part was the staff - so friendly and helpful! Reasonable prices for yummy food and great service? Yes, please!"}
{"text":"Just like eating a Coney in Detroit. In addition, the service is excellent. Recommend trying this at least once"}
{"text":"I drove 30 miles to try this place for the first time. The decor is minimal but celebrates the Motor City. I had 3 Coney Islands and Faygo Rock & Rye and Vanilla Creme Soda. Very good meal and I would highly recommend it for Phoenicians who need a taste of Motown"}
{"text":"So happy that this place opened. I'm almost embarrassed to admit how much I've missed hanis since I moved here from MI 5 years ago.  My husband and I got the hanis, chili dog and chili cheese fries with Rock & Rye obviously!  Everything was just how we remembered it to be.  Oh and BTW  to all the cheapy reviewers I could not care less if they charge $2.50 for a Faygo.  If you can't afford $2.50 then you shouldn't be going out to eat in the first place, this isn't a soup kitchen it's a restaurant if you don't want to pay the price drink water, kay?  The owner and his staff are super nice and all from MI - I would expect nothing less.  If you are from MI and miss the Coney Island staples check this place out you won't be disappointed...if you're not then try it for the first time, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Walked in and was immediately greeted by the staff. Tried the recommended the green chili burger. Fabulous!!!!! Food was cooked to order, fast, fresh and hot! Owner came out to greet us and a huge plus for that. Overall loved everything about our visit today and will be definitely returning!!!!"}
{"text":"You know the saying \"take the money and run\" ? At this place, it's \"take the food and run\"! Or the burger flippers will assault you rudeness!  This place is out of wack besides their food.  Any and every food item is tasteful but that's it. Depending on what you want to eat - you'll have to eat it here or nothing (stupidity set up their menu). Certain \"menu options\" are dine in only which is uncomfortably funny since during certain hours it's \"take out\" only.   It's a damn shame that the food you may want to enjoy is only under their circumstances.  Service here is a joke. There's absolutely no manners in the burger flippers or whatever that title would be called.  You call in to be hung up on or told to wait without a please or thank you. Certain hours if you walk in, it's take out only... they'll gladly let you know. Oh not to mention they close before eight...    Check your to go food before leaving*"}
{"text":"It's been almost 20 years since I lived in Michigan and have been craving a Hani. The food at Detroit Coney Grill is outstanding. It hit he spot and took me back to Hockeytown!"}
{"text":"Throughout my four month jury duty service, I came to this location often. My first visit there, I witnessed a very kind act by this staff. The kindness they showed to the homeless man, made me want to give them my business. This is absolutely some of the best service I have received in town as well. The guys are always friendly and fast. The grilled chicken pita and fries are fantastic. The food is high quality and they work with very fresh ingredients. Whenever I'm downtown, I will make sure to return to give my business to such a wonderful staff."}
{"text":"This location is as wonderful as the downtown location. My husband and I have been to this location twice now. We always receive the friendliest and fastest service. The owner is always friendly as well. I love their grilled chicken pita and fresh cut fries. The coneys are great as well. The quality and prices are fantastic, but it's the wonderful staff that keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"We got a coney, A triple burger, and chili cheese fries. Everything was freaking amazing. The staff was really helpful and grateful! Highly recommend. We're from Flagstaff and don't have access to coneys (other than Sonic ) or good fast burgers other than from large chains. Wayyyyyy better than 5 guys. Love love loved the chili! Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Detroit city in the Sun!    Coney through and through.   The snap of a Vienna coney, brick chili, saucey cheese!   Oh!  And faygo, Vernor's and Towne Club ... Better made potato chips!   Staff, owner and food. ..  All genuinely awesome!   The drive from Casa Grande was worth it!   Let's all pray Casa Grande gets one!   Tammy & Steve!"}
{"text":"Love the boneless red wings. Always get a Detroit coney! Fries are just okay. Love the authentic Detroit chips and pop!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I had the Coney Dog with Chili Cheese Fries and a strawberry Faygo. It was delicious and messy  Very fresh food and made to order. The owner is nice and very funny! Will be back"}
{"text":"Moved to Chandler, AZ from the Detroit area a few years ago. Found this place through a friend. All I can say is Awesome! Real Detroit style Coneys, homemade fries, Better Made potato chips, and Faygo. The even hade a couple flavors of Towne Club. I have been dying for coneys for the past few years. This place is incredible. Hopefully they open one closer to Chandler but Tempe isn't too far. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and you cannot go wrong here. the food is fantastically done in the MI coney dog tradition. the staff and the owner are extremely friendly and helpful. and they offer faygo. also you can wipe your dirty feet on an Ohio State floor mat."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! A true taste of home from Detroit! I Love in LA now and was working out here in Tempe and saw this and had to stop! Great food, David was so welcoming. Felt like I was home! Will definitely be coming back every time I'm out here for work. Would love to see them get up to LA area!!"}
{"text":"This place gets an extra star because the inside was so CLEAN!  Other than that we were rather unimpressed.  The food was pretty good, but the portions were all pretty small; the chili tasted great but the fresh cut fries weren't cooked enough and were pretty mushy.  I'll probably come back sometime to support a local business but I don't get the rave reviews."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the actually location. Met the owner, and that guy is something else...in a good way! What a great joint that is locally owned. Can't wait till they get out to the east valley!   Coneys were bomb.com. Hortatory a burger next!   Only complaint, it was a little warm."}
{"text":"Can't tell you how long I have waited to have a Hani and a coney in AZ. Well folks the time is now. Great atmosphere, good people and food that reminds me of home. Do yourself a favor and visit Detroit Coney grill. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Woo-hoo!  They're open!  Now I can get my Detroit food fix in Arizona!  First thing you see when you walk in is the decor and employees are all in Detroit colors, orange and blue.  You can buy the t-shirts too I think.  The menu is pretty simple, burgers and dogs. Pita sandwiches and salads, fries, chips and drinks.  They have several flavors of Faygo soda pop for $2.25 and bags of Better Made Potato Chips.  There is no Sanders Hot Fudge or ice cream of any kind.  No desserts that I saw at all.  I ordered the regular Coney Dog, $3.95 which came with Chili and onions, an order of the hand cut French fries to split, and Faygo (\"Which way diddee go!?\") Root Beer.  My daughter got a Breaded Chicken Tenderloin \"Hani\" Pita Sandwich and also a root beer.  The minute I bit into a French fry and tasted how delicious it was, I walked up to the counter, told the guy, \"I'm not sharing those so we'd better get another order!\". They tasted like my Mother's homemade ones!   The Coney Dog looked a little small on first view, but I bit into the hot dog and it almost audibly popped! Scrumptious juices exuded from it.  This is no ordinary hot dog.  Warning: It's messy.    The root beer bottle was kind of tepid, not ice cold, maybe just because they had such a rush of business on Opening Day that they couldn't keep up with the demand? I took my water glass, filled with ice and poured the drink over it, solving the problem.    The owner is very nice.  He and all the employees are all from various parts of Michigan.  I'm from Livonia, suburb of Detroit, myself.  I had heard about this Grand Opening at another Detroit themed place, Sunshine Motor City Cafe, and I think it is great that we ex-Michiganders have more than one place now to go get that back-home feeling, even if it is 113° outside!"}
{"text":"Let me start with i love this place the food is great and as a detroit native i love the fago and bettermaide but i feel since they opened the new store the service has gone down the people at the front counter are rude and dont talk to you just today i went in and the guy asked me what do you want i looked at the sign for the special and he said the special and started putting it in before i said yes then i asked for chilli cheese on the fries he said nothing just took a deep breath and yelled out 11.45 i said i had a five star card and he just looked at me i pulled it out he snatched it scaned it and dropped it on the counter i asked about a rockin rye fago he cut me off and said \"I aint got none\" i gave my card to pay he swiped it through the recpit down with a pen and turned to talk with some one behind him i singed it he turned took it and thats it didnt say a word to me i was going to stock up when i come in i get 4 6packs of fago but i felt like i was being pushed off if anyone reads this i hope you do some training or something i have seen alot of places die out here for these reasons and i would hate to see this one go away"}
{"text":"I've never been so excited to eat in my life. This was so delicious! The owner was so sweet and it was super packed. Which showed that it definitely is a good restaurant! And it's around the corner from me:)"}
{"text":"Although I work five minutes from here I oddly rarely eat here. It's good comfort food to be sure but I'm 100 lbs of comfort food over my limit. Went back today in desperate need of comfort. It was delicious. Friendly staff. Hand made food. Lively banter. I'm 1300 calories in at this point but I'm all the calmer for it."}
{"text":"Little out of the way from the typical tourist areas, but it was convenient after a morning at LEGO land. Thanks to yelp, we found this gem. Onolicious burgers, dogs, fries, chili cheese fries, and onion rings. Soda selection was good too. Owner came by to ask how everything was, which was a nice surprise. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had the Special for $7.77 today...coney dog \"loose style\" with their amazing fries and a drink. Gotta love this place! They now have a frequent diner system set-up so I'll be sure to go often!!!"}
{"text":"The RUDEST customer service. I went here two days in a row. The first day I walked in and there was no greeting. All of the workers were sitting down. The lady who did get up to come to the register was drinking on a soda and didn't attempt to ask if it was my first time or if I needed help. I obviously did as I was scanning the menu. She had an attitude and everything I asked she responded with \"what?\" So I had to repeat myself constantly. I ordered a burger and it was pretty good & the order was accurate. The second day, I walked in & the same lady came to the register with a dry hello. I ordered a coney dog, but then when it was time for my receipt i signed it but I didnt have the other copy so I can know my order number. She had an attitude because I needed another one and said, \"Well I handed it to you.\" Obviously not because the only one I had was the merchant copy w/ my signature. Pretty good food, just horrible customer service. I gave the same attitude that was given to me."}
{"text":"So glad I stumbled upon this place! Feels like home with all the Detroit sports memorabilia inside. It gets better though - the food. Great original coney dogs. Also, great burgers. Once voted some of the best burgers you could get in Phoenix. Still think so. They also have Gyros but have not tried those yet. Quick note if you order a burger get the triple or larger as the patties are very thin."}
{"text":"Every time I walk into this restaurant it makes me proud to be from Detroit. I'm so glad there's an authentic coney place here in the valley. The food is amazing just like the ambiance. Towne Club and Faygo pop! Better Made potato chips! What a walk down memory lane. If I could give 10 stars on here I would, thank you Detroit Coney Grill for giving us Michigan transplants here in AZ a place where we can get good Michigan grub and a cool place to eat it at! Ain't no coney like a D-town Coney from Detroit Coney Grill"}
{"text":"If you're from Michigan, you must try this place.  Great food, Faygo pop, Better Made chips and Detroit t-shirts.  The Mackinac burger is to die for!  The employees are very nice.  I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"My fries are old and their taziki sause is horrid. None of us enjoined our food.  We asked for a togo container for my chicken gyro since i have to wait to eat it till i get real taziki and they gave us a paper bag. Their pop machine was put of coke and cherry flavor. Not worth the drive for us. Hopefully it was just a bad day but it's to far for me to give them another try."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Monday in a row we have come here. We get the coney dog and chili cheese fries. It's so delicious, especially if you want a quick meal that's not a typical fast food joint! The service is really great and you can tell the owner truly does care if you enjoy the food! We will frequent this place again!"}
{"text":"Best burger in at least downtown Phoenix. If you want an amazing burger, order the Big Mackinaw and pay to add the grilled onions. It's a take on the Big Mac but multiples of goodness better.  No frills place but the food is exceptional. Highly rec"}
{"text":"Congratulations Detroit Coney Grill, you got my first every 5 start vote! Were you the best restaurant I've ever eaten ate? No, but you certainly had the best greeter/order taker/server/nice to my kids person I've ever had at a restaurant.   We came in, my wife and I and our 4 children (all 6 and under), you were so happy to see us. Most restaurants, especially during the lunch hour look at a family of six, with six little kids as more of an dumpster fire rather than an opportunity to serve. We sat down and then I placed a pretty complex order. Hot dogs with various toppings, fries with cheese, fries without. No onions or this but mustard no ketchup, wait, yes ketchup, oh and a chicken Philly pita. The food came out hot and fresh. The kids loved getting to pick their soda choice on the touch screen. You asked periodically if we were doing okay even as onlookers wondered how long we were going to take up the seats.   Now for the food review. The Coney dog, your flagship item, it...was...tasty. The value meal was 2 Coneys (hot dog with chili, mustard and diced onions) fries and a drink for $9.99. That's a very solid meal. We had enough fries (natural cut and cooked just right) to split with three of the four kids. Our one daughter (5) inhaled the cheese fries and my wife thought the chicken Philly was so tasty.   You have this great little way of catching my cell number for coupons. Even though I usually hate something like this, getting a text from you today made me remember the wonderful time we shared way back to yesterday at 12:15.   Thank you Detroit Coney Grill, I'll see you very soon."}
{"text":"Man...This place is a block from my office and I never knew it. I got the Detroit Coney combo. Loose ground beef,  chili, dog, mustard and onions. It was so good. And the fries were amazing.  For $7.77 (after yelp discount) it was a great deal."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! Coney dog was awesome and the chile cheese fries were amazing. Highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"I did a little online search today for a fast food place in Tempe, and Detroit coney grill came up. I read many positive reviews and I decided to give it a shot. The food was different from what I have had in the past and was amazing, but the best thing about the place is the people. The owner works here himself and he is very friendly. I didn't except this place when I was looking for a fast food place. The price is very reasonable. If you are looking for a fast food place in Tempe, definitely check this place out. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Nothing but love from the guys at Extreme Micro we have crew of about 10 guys and we love to eat here  they know us as as soon as we walk though the door  always know us by name  the owner always hustling and grinding still always has a huge smile and supper friendly  we always get the triple with cheese and Cajun fries  have had the dogs and sandwiches love them all but their burger is out standing!  the patty on the burger is thin but so juicy that is why we get the triple  they have so much flavor!!  their crew is always happy to help and happy to be there!"}
{"text":"Faygo Soda brought back memories. Chili dog was great. A few onions go a long way. Don't over do it unless you really like fresh chopped white onions.  The curly fries were just ok. I was expecting Cajun seasoning with a little more flavor and bite. Not happening. Nothin special. The hot dog was good. Nice snap when you bit into it. Trust me on the onion thing tho. Oh yeah. I'm from Cincinnati and nothing beats Skyline Chili so take my review with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Best Coney's in town, need to open on the westside up by Arrowhead. Great food and service . We love coming here"}
{"text":"Incredible food that is as authentic as you can get. My boyfriend and I went for the first time tonight and after finishing dinner we ordered a second dinner each lol. I am from Detroit and the food was just like home for me. Hands down this is the ONLY place I would recommend outside of Detroit for a good coney. David, the owner, is as welcoming as you can get and so passionate about the food and making sure  it takes like home. If you're not from Detroit you'll still find this place to be the best you ever had."}
{"text":"Love this place the burgers are so good & the fries are some of the best in the valley. Try the big D next time your here I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"What a great find! Thanks Yelp. I was in town for a convention and tried to eat here on Sunday... But they were closed.   I managed to sneak over on Tue for lunch. I had the everyday coney dog combo, it was great. Chrissy was real outgoing and helpful.   I ended up bringing a co-worker for lunch the next day. Had the big Mack cousin... Much better than a Big Mac   We need one of these stores in WA state!"}
{"text":"Having read multiple reviews for Detroit Coney Grill, I had very high expectations going in. A hot dog joint in Arizona with exceptionally good reviews, I knew I had to try it! Upon walking in we were immediately greeted and asked if we had dined there before. Hearing that this was our first time, we were given  a brief but informative run down of the menu. We were left alone for a few minutes to ponder our dinner choice.  We ordered 3 chili dogs, a burger and an obligatory order of fries.  Our expectations were absolutely met once we received our freshly cooked food. The chili was bursting with flavor, the fries were cooked and salted to perfection. The buns were fluffy but not too fluffy where they couldn't hold the ooey gooey contents.  I was truly impressed with every aspect of my dining experience from the superb service to the exceptional food."}
{"text":"Great little place in a strip mall in Tempe. Went at 1230 with my wife. She had Coney hot dog with sauerkraut mustard and pickle relish. I had Coney with chili and ground beef on a bun. For $2 more we added fresh fries (skin on and a drink). $15 for lunch not bad. Wait staff-you pay at counter friendly and walked around asking how everything was. Nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"Really good hamburgers, fries and onion rings.  Their burgers are super thin, so the point is to get like a 4-5 patty burger.  Great hospitality from the owner as well who let us try their chili burger (I think) for free.  If you're in the area and in the mood for a burger, come here for sure."}
{"text":"Detroit Coney Grill does it again.  This place is starting to open up new locations around the Valley and I can see why.  Fantastic burgers.  The best hamburger in town.  I can see why the reviews are so good.   And the only real Coneys in the Southwest.    If you are anywhere near the small check this place out. You can thank me later. Wow! What a great meal. As always."}
{"text":"The real deal.  Motown in the desert.  Missing coneys?  I had coney withdrawal for almost 20 years after moving out here. The Detroit Coney Grill opened.  I'm not going to lie - I was skeptical.  I've tried other imitations and they never came close. But David and his team at Detroit Coney nailed it.   And if you're with someone that doesn't appreciate awesome coneys?  No problem. Some of the best hamburgers (they grind their i.e.  Hamburger meat fresh, on-site according to the owner) and cheese steaks of any restaurant in town."}
{"text":"This an awesome place!  Hot dogs snap when you take a bite! After 16 years in the Valley I found my hot dog spot!"}
{"text":"Great dogs just like back home. Great people always in the house. Great owner always willing to go above and beyond to make his customers happy"}
{"text":"Good hotdogs I from New York we know our food. Friendly establishment would bring my co-workers to dine in among mostly male client tel. Clean got food fast fresh made fries."}
{"text":"This is the spot to hit if you are in the mood for a great Chili Cheese Dog! This is a legit spot!!! And the thing that took me the most by surprise was how insanely good their fries are! These are like straight out of the dirt from Idaho kind of potatoes! The chili on the dogs is ridiculous as well! These guys got it locked!   I will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Looked up a place for lunch on google maps and yelp for something new, got there today around 3:15, first time there. Was hoping to have a really good experience with the food and service, as I love hot dogs and they have good reviews. So I ordered the everyday special, my order came up and the guy that rung me up eventually said \"here you go boss\" and left the tray there...no thank you or anything else. It was super hot in there, no a/c in the building, the back door open (for venting I guess).  Idk what else to say, nothing special or even mediocre"}
{"text":"Best freaking coneys and loose meats ever! Delicious and service was outstanding!! A true gem and Chrissy and Danille took excellent care of us so that I definitely recommend this place as highly as I am able. If you are in Arizona at all and do not come here it is TOTALLY your loss!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after several clients at work and my boyfriend from Detroit have constantly raved about it, and boy is it amazing! Great service, delicious food and extremely fast. We drive all the way from cave creek and the 101!! Would love to see a location open is by us!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and price.  The chili dog looked as good as it tasted.  The dog had especially good flavor."}
{"text":"We found Detroit Coney grill on Yelp and visited due to the high rating. They deserve the 5 star rating for excellent dogs, burgers, fries and drinks. We tried a bit of everything to cast a wide net for review. They serve a true and delicious coney dog, and tbe burger meat is fresh and stacked as high as you'd like. We were especially impressed with the fresh cut fries and bottle drinks made with old school cane sugar. This place is where to go to celebrate an occasion, or to even to relieve lonliness. The service is polite and efficient, and the workers all seem to care very much for their tasks at hand, almost as if they were serving a higher purpose. There is nothing like a crouded room full of happy like minded people enjoying the comfort food we all crave!"}
{"text":"Looking for the best chili cheese fries and burgers in the valley? This little fast food spot is where you'll find them. The hand cut French fries are perfectly fried and  big enough to handle all the Chili and cheese that follow. The burgers here are don't come with less than 2 patties because they're super thin, and very flavorful. The quality of the beef is very noticeable. If you enjoy spicy, I recommend trying their Green Chile burger with bacon. Green hatch Chiles from New Mexico really make your mouth tingle with heat. The service was excellent and it's always nice to be greeted by the store owner. He's always so welcoming and makes sure you're enjoying the food. I can't say enough good things about this place. If I were to critique one thing, it would probably be to have more upkeep on the restrooms. They weren't dirty, they just needed some paper towels restocked. Thumbs way up for a great find!"}
{"text":"First time here. Good food, definitely not healthy eating but worth breaking a diet for. Some of the family had their Monday Detroit special. Another had their Triple Burger, & paid extra for grilled onions & jalapenos. Fast friendly service. Happy Labor Day to the staff who had to work today."}
{"text":"Whenever I miss Detroit food I come here LOVE THIS SPOT! Good food you can't go wrong stop in and enjoy  don't forget to have a Faygo PoP!"}
{"text":"One word....LEGIT!!!! Being a Detroit native I had my doubts about how \"authentic\" this place would be. However it tasted, looked and smelled like home :) This place is the only place that has authentic Detroit style coneys in the Phoenix area. Other places in the area advertise Detroit style coneys but don't even come close (many use hormel chili and skinless hot dogs....yuck)!!! This place is the real deal and even get their products shipped in from Detroit!! The owner is a super nice guy and came out and talked to us for a few minutes! So if you're looking for a REAL Detroit style coney look no further this place is the real deal!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Detroit Coney. Their prices are amazing and the burgers are even better. Staff who works here takes care of you with the food. Its been a long time since I've actually been to Detroit but I know that they pretty much only hire people from Michigan so I'd say yeah its pretty authentic.  Will return"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff.  Great coneys, excellent and addictive fries.  We came with our two kids and they have an 'Everyday Special' of 2 Coneys, fries and a drink for $9.99.  Filled the kids up with smiles on their faces."}
{"text":"I'm from the East coast and I grew up eating Coney Dogs... these are fantastic and the French Fries (freshly cut right in front of you) are some of the best I've ever tasted. Go here immediately, you'll be sucked in the second you smell the food cooking!"}
{"text":"Good service, nice enough little place, lots of cool Detroit stuff on the walls, but in the end the Coney sauce was just not the same and the dogs did not have the skin crunch like back home."}
{"text":"I love this place.  As a 50's diner afficionado, this place hits home for me.  The hot dogs are tasty, with great chili and onions (a.k.a. The Coney, my favorite) sloppily drenched on top.  The burgers are a little small, so don't hesitate to order a double or triple, but they taste great with melted cheese, pickles, ketchup and mustard.  Throw in a cashier done up in 50's style, and I expected the Fonz to stroll in while I scarfed down my food.  I was in Phoenix for a week-long conference and I ate here 3 times.  Next time I'm in town, this will the FIRST place I go to."}
{"text":"have eaten there a few times it does remind me of my time spent in the Detroit area coneys fries and red pop (soda)"}
{"text":"Average gyro pita, not much meat. I guess that's not what they're known for. Small portion of onion rings. Wrong order delivered to my table, had to send back. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I are born and raised in Detroit and have been living in Phoenix for 2 years now. Somehow we didn't know about this place until this weekend. We made the drive from N. Phoenix and were VERY happy we did! The food was great, the service was amazingly friendly and the Detroit decor made us both so happy! Sitting there happily eating our coneys and listening to people talk about 696, Hazel Park, the Lions, Lafayette Coney Island was such a trip. Thanks for the bit of home here in the Valley.   I also loved the \"pop\" sign on the wall!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best burger in Tempe! An amazing price and in my neighborhood! Wish I had known about it sooner and will be back with friends! The owner personally thanked us for our business, was a very nice touch knowing we were supporting him!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. 2.95 for a double burger. 3.95 for a double cheese. Possibly the best burger dare I say ever. The works w no mustard add 1k island. So bombish."}
{"text":"Miss the D? Better Made chips? Faygo?  Awesome authentic coneys, excellent burgers and the best hand cut fries in the valley await you at Detroit Coney!!  People here are super awesome too. Definitely check it out for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Best chili dog in Phoenix. Products are flown in from Detroit with exception of fresh cut potatoes and Faygo!"}
{"text":"I love supporting locally owned small business, especially when they're run by great owners & staff.   This joint serves up hospitality with its delicious coney dogs, fries & Faygo pop. Being from Texas & living in Arizona I've never had a real Faygo until today. We got 3 different ones to try and they were all tasty.   The coney dogs come on a soft steamed bun with a snappy dog, mustard & onions. The hand cut fries are tasty, especially seasoned and chili & cheese added.   This is a don't miss spot!"}
{"text":"Burgers so good you'll want too sew your butt shut. 4 stars because once i got a gyro and onion rings and i was given 6 onion rings and no taziki sauce on the gyro."}
{"text":"Had my first visit here last week. Dogs were really good & authentic and fries were fantastic. Skin on and had them well done. Perfect spot for a quick lunch and service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I do not say this much, about anything, I Love this place. they make a delicious burger and the staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Staff was extremely friendly. Greets you with a smile, comes and ask how everything is after ordering, and makes sure to say goodbye after eating ! The coneys are delicious ! Never tasted crunch in a hot dog like I did with Detroit coney ! All of that at a really cheap price ! Will be coming back again"}
{"text":"Quick and easy for lunch.  Really good burger and fries.  A small version of \"Five Guys\" is what I would compare to on the East Coast."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are ok.  Not exactly what I would get when in Ann Arbor but still not bad.  Prices are on the high side for a hot dog.   Not sure if I will be back.  This place definitely does a good lunch business though."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the Big Mac and it was delicious!!!! Definitely recommend this place. Great homemade fries."}
{"text":"When I hear the words \"Detroit\" and \"Coney\" in the same sentence, I generally have a good idea of what to expect. Detroit Coney Grill comes close...    As a Detroit Native transplanted to Arizona's East Valley, I was glad to find at least SOME of my hometown favorites, which is why this place gets 4 stars. No wing dings, no breakfast any time...which make me sad,  but plenty of D town chilli goodness. I've been there twice and have left full and satisfied.  My first visit was actually very pleasant.. David had one of the cooks fix me up a 'Telway' styled slider on the house.. everything is made fresh to order (hence no wingdings.. they're frozen and take too long) and the cooks are more than eager to give you the food the way you like... I asked for the potatoes to be slightly soft and I got them just the way I like them. Other than the distance, I'm in San Tan Valley, they're in Tempe.. a good 45 minutes away, I would be there once a week.   A few warnings:   *If you order chili cheese fries, opt for sliced cheese rather than cheese sauce... it's how they do it at my favorite coney island in Detroit, and you'll be glad you went that route.   *Seasoned fries are a little over seasoned.. if you want to try those, ask for light seasoning or really just opt for plain fries.. they're made fresh.. why ruin them with a heavy coating of lawry's?   *the spiral fries don't add much to the meal other than a premium price tag, so opt instead for the plain ones and fork out that extra dough on the chili instead.   *finally, know how to order a coney... it's a steamed bun, a snappy dearborn dog, chili, mustard and diced onions. Deviate from this at your own peril, and be warned... they will make fun of you if you do!"}
{"text":"Just ate a great dog with best fries ever, Detroit coney, I wish I would have got a burger they smash them thin thin, a triple with cheese is four bucks and they have spiral fries, it's ranked number 35 on yelp out of all the nation. Ours was 16.00 and the owner comes around talking to you great guy.."}
{"text":"Loose meat in a hot dog bun!  Like maid-right or nu-way if your familiar with those.  Great Cajun fries and clean little joint."}
{"text":"As an import from Detroit, I knew I had to stop here the moment I unpacked after a 2100 mile hike. As soon as you walk in, you're greeted with Detroit Sports everywhere, even an Ohio State rug you have to step on!   The food is of the Lafayette fashion in Detroit. Delicious hot dogs that snap with every bite. The french fries could come plain or loaded with heart attack inducing chili and cheese and that was very much welcomed!   Whether you're from Michigan or not, this place is worth the visit! I only ask that the dining area be maintained cleaber."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by after seeing that this place was #30 on yelps top 100 of 2015 list. I'm not sure if I don't appreciate a good coney dog/I've never been to Detroit, but I didn't find the food here that special. Perhaps it's because I expected the food to blow me out of the water and had high expectations, but I didn't think the coney dog to be out of this world good. The fries I had were pretty good and the interior decorations do give it a nice homey feel though!"}
{"text":"Incredible service, very friendly and kind. Tasty and quick food for cheap, a must for all dog fans, especially if you're a former Michiganer."}
{"text":"Did the Detroit Coney with fries. Pretty ok, but chili didn't stand out for me, and bun was cool (not steamed). Busy lunch crowd was a pretty happy bunch. I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"Coming from a born and raised Detroit native, this place here touches home, love it hear just wish there were a location in the West Valley.... please come further west."}
{"text":"BEST Coney in town!   We waited a long time for this place to open and it was worth the wait.  The staff was friendly.  The food was GREAT.  Love the fresh cut fries. You have to  LOVE A Placed that goes the distance to bring the favorites from back home to Arizona.  Everyone that came in seemed to feel the same way too!  We came all the way from Chandler and will return often......count on us as regulars! ASU students have it made since they are so close by......great value and good food FAST......"}
{"text":"A good choice if your in the mood for a coney dog or hamburger and fries.  A little crowded and limited seats right at lunch time, but they got the food out quick."}
{"text":"Hands down the best cheese fries in Arizona. The staff are extra friendly and attentive as well :)"}
{"text":"Went there for first time and it was amazing! David the owner helped us what to order since it was our first time. He recommended us to order the coney dogs with fries and triple patty hamburger and to upgrade to Fago drinks. The best idea!!! The burger was fresh and hot ( they ground there meet there) the coney was good but we should have added  cheese, and the chili cheese fries were amazing! The Fago pops were so creamy definitely  a must try.  Thank you David, we will definitely be coming back .... We need one Gilbert by the 60:)"}
{"text":"Really liked my triple burger with fries, super nice employees who even say hello and goodbye"}
{"text":"So you're from Detroit and you want a coney. This is the only place to go.    Fresh ground beef, house made chili... That oh-so-important snap of the dog.  It's all here.     It's worth the drive, no doubt about it. We will gladly make the drive from east Mesa again and again!    Oh, glass bottle Faygo and Better Made chips are icing on the cake.  You interested be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch here. Let me be clear, this isn't a fancy, gourmet burger. In the category of fast food, however, it is a definite step up. We tried both the burger and a hot dog. Both solid, tasty dishes. They were fresh and not greasy. The fries were hot and fresh out of the fryer. You have to knock it out of the park for a five star review, but this place deserves a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was delicious!  I always compare every coney dog to the ones I grew up with at Coney Islander in Tulsa, OK.  These were pretty close but I'd still have to try them a few more times to say they are just as good.  I would definitely recommend this place and will continue to try their different menu items."}
{"text":"3 bucks a hot dog , Detroit coney but I have to say the hot dogs were good but very over priced and no candied onions really"}
{"text":"This place is really special- tastes just like home/ Detroit. Great food, fast service, friendly atmosphere- this is a weekly must do. Can't say enough good about this place- if you haven't been here, you're really missing out. There is no place in AZ that had the Vienna hot dogs and chili Detroit coneys are known for except Detroit Coney.  Mike S."}
{"text":"Perfect Coney...Perfect \"DE-TWA\" Coney!  The guy even sells Town Club and of course Faygo pop. Yes...pop...NOT soda!    The owner was nice/friendly and proud - And I love seeing that sort of sincere passion with someone and their business...it Carries over into their food!    The coney was about as legit as it gets too. A Detroit Coney is a bit more savory than other coneys...which can be Good but different. Anyway, a true coney isn't for everyone...but, in my humble opinion everyone should try one! :)-  This guy has nailed it - bringing Phoenix a nice little piece of Detroit - the good part :)."}
{"text":"I love this place since it is the tastiest chili hotdog in Arizona. Their chili is always on point and that dog pops in your mouth everytime when you first bite in. The only thing different today was the steamed buns seemed a little off because they were a bit dry. I will continue to come here since it is closer than their Tempe and Phoenix locations. The owner is a super friendly guys that makes you feel right at home. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"I got a yelp email showing the top 3 places for dogs and this place was #1 for me! Got the Coney meal with chili cheese fries and a triple cheese burger. Finished everything and still wanted more since it was hella good! The owner was friendly and helped me decide what to get, there meat in the chili and in the burger was so fresh and like no other place I been to. Will definitely be back here with the rest of the mi familia!"}
{"text":"Awesome food the owner is from Ferndale Mi. my old high school rival in basketball. I am a Southfield native.  The food here is exceptional and they do it just like in the D.  Would eventually like to see the old Fish dog and a patty melt on the menu like 8 Mile Coney Island....lol....don't hesitate to try this place out. They even had the Michigan State game on when I came there. Made a brotha get all warm and fluttery inside. Nice clean facility food is prepared right in front.Way to represent the D."}
{"text":"I had the coney dog.  It was a coney dog.  I did not phone home about it.  It was just a coney dog."}
{"text":"Service was swell, food was okay. C'mon, I'm a girl from Flint so I grew up eating Coneys.  Heck, I even worked at a Coney Island.  That's what they call 'em.    I ate two up with extra mustard almost every Friday night before I went to work at my other job. I went to school with the family that made the most delicious Viennas (and Red Hots, Ring Bologna, etc.) which are tradition at all of the area Coneys.  I even make a trip to one of the area favorites almost annually..  So for me I thinks it's fair to call this authentic, but it's still not the real thing. A pretty good local coney -sure. Now if only they had French Fries with gravy.  That's another Coney tradition.  Or better yet, fried mushrooms with cocktail sauce on the side. And what was most obvious was the cost.  I took out a few family members for lunch and spent much less than $40 for four people.   Six coneys, soup, salad, fries with gravy, four beverages.  Here it's gonna cost ya more. If you got a hankering for a Coney, this will probably work. For me, I'll just continue to load my luggage with Koegels or wait to eat one up when I travel back to MI."}
{"text":"Small spot with limited seating...but great food.  Get a triple burger at the minimum.  My friend had the hotdog with everything.  We both left happy and full.  Pricing was average but just really good food.  When you arrive to order?  Have someone in the group get seats.  It fills up fast!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food and people! They have Faygo & Better Made chips plus Town Club pop!  You gotta try this place,  no other coney compares!  Tell Dave (owner) I sent ya.  They grind their own beef daily,  fries are greatly made daily.   There are daily specials.   Be prepared for fresh!"}
{"text":"#30 restaurant in America.   You gotta come and get a coney and coney fries.   Indulge in some Faygo and Vernors.   They grind their own beef."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after an airport run and looking on Yelp. Ordered a double cheeseburger and the owner asked how was my burger after a few bites. I said it was over cooked and dry. He immediately made me a replacement no charge and said \"no one gets a bad burger in my place.\"  2nd burger was very good. Will return again!"}
{"text":"Wow best coney and loose since I was in Detroit, maybe better! Owner Dave is very nice guy! And yes I got a faygo POP!"}
{"text":"The taste of home right down the street. Now would love one in N Scottsdale 101 and FLW. Great food and fast."}
{"text":"Being from the Detroit area when I moved here in '99 I cod not find a \"Good Coney\". Until today, this place is the real deal!   Best Coney Island in Phoenix hands down, add a Faygo Rock n Rye I was back home. Two on One all the way with fries and a rock n rye, so good, no great. I just wish there was one closer to Pima and Frank Lloydd Wright. But until there is it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"It's odd to see a young staff that greets customers with a great attitude, my 3 year old spilled soda and I felt so bad, they came around the counter cleaned it up and didn't let us feel bad, not only is the staff awesome the coney dogs are a must with chili cheese fries! :)"}
{"text":"It was like walking into a Midwest portal. Really friendly people-made a few friends. Crissy and Danielle were very fun to talk to. I had the gyro salad and it was awesome."}
{"text":"Didn't get the opportunity to eat. I walked up, decided what I wanted and the guy behind the counter decided it was more important to be on his phone then ask for my order. He actually turned his back to me. Never going back. Being from Michigan I was looking forward to a Coney.  I was there at 12:35 on 6-14-2017"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and friendly atmosphere. Right around the corner. Detroit nostalgia abounds....owner is super friendly and always greets us with a smile. Faygo sodas are available and the fries are hand cut"}
{"text":"I stopped by here since I am bison and it is next to the nail place where I was at. I have the Detroit loose burger. It was so good and fresh. I love the setup of the restaurant. It's a Detroit local look and the food was great. I love that the owner was present and he came by and asked us how we liked the food. It was a great hotdog place. It's so relaxed and it just felt good to be there."}
{"text":"Best Chili Cheese Fries ever!!!  Come to Avondale!  To the owner... Just like you asked here are my main cross streets: Avondale Blvd. and Thomas.   Review: (4.5) batmosphere was great! Right as you walked in very friendly. The owner even gave my boyfriend a free conie as a sample!  The conie was definitely delicious and my boyfriend and I are not hot dog lovers, but it has no pork so we tried it.  We got there towards closing time and they said we could stay and eat. I was already thinking about eating outside so we wouldn't bother them. Lol very kind people.   So, My \"Hani\" pita was delicious, the chicken was crispy, cheese and just flavorful! My boyfriend had the D burger and he said it was delicious! We had the chili cheese fries and I must say, better than Portillos or Lenny's (or it is Leanie's?).  Only reason I did not give a 5 is because I had the Greek salad and it wasn't as delicious as I thought. The Greek salad at Pita Kitchen is better.  Oh and we had. Faygo pop, the black cherry flavor, it was tasty!   I totally recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I just want to say first time tonight and the food was awesome!! Sure did miss faygo pop so nice treat to be able to get that.we drove from mesa to try the detroit coney that we have been craving kudos to you!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Danielle was a wonderful greeter and explained the menu and extras to me. A customer having lunch recommended I get the hot dogs. Tried the everyday special....fantastic!! Will be back - thanks"}
{"text":"Is it really so cold in the D? Sure is bitch. I ordered the Big D burger, it tasted like Berry Gordy and Motown came all over that burger while Violent Jay from ICP shoved that messy burger in my face. I sat at a table next to Dej Loaf and Eminem. Dej was drinkin a red pop Faygo and Em sipped on an ice cold Vernors as they reminisced about the days when Kid Rock was still cool. I fuck with this place heavy."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch, wow great lunch specials and really fast service. I had the two coney dog lunch special which is a very nice man sized lunch special.  Owner was very friendly and an authentic Detroit food aficionado.  Would love to get a Detroit Coney Dog in the far East valley."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp! The stars on this place our perfect. The service is outstanding for one and place is clean. The food burgers were delicious and Fresh and priced perfectly for what you get! The topping are also fresh and tasty . Onion were crispy and yummy"}
{"text":"Was a little optimistic being from Chicago, but I was working in the area and you can't go wrong with one of their burgers and a coney fry! Great food, great staff. Even went so much as every employee yelled thank you when you tip. Something as little as a thank you for a couple dollars made my day"}
{"text":"Overall the food is good but I am actually from Detroit and they're prices are not like this. I mean 3.95 for a coney? That's crazy high! The coney island my family goes to in detroit has coneys for 1.85 and on Wednesdays its 99 cent! The fries are a very small size and the last time I went, the chili cheese fries were salty. Really? Salt on fries that's gonna be under chili and cheese. And SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THE FAYGO! Their faygo is like the old time Coca-Cola bottles and their like $3. Here's a tip: faygo is at ajs fine foods and QT! Again good food, crappy hours and prices"}
{"text":"Went here for a Dog and ended up ordering cheese burger. Ordered the Big Mack, there version of McDonalds Big Mac. Burger was cheap, $7 and very good. Got it for takeout, the isidide of the restaurant was crowded and not the cleanest. Will definitely return. Cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Everyone is always friendly whenever you come in and Chrissy gives you great suggestions to add to your meal. The food is fast and simple. I always get the coney dog!"}
{"text":"Seen this place on here a lot and have seen many positive reviews, so as my husband and I were driving by yesterday we decided to stop and try their coney dogs. I am so glad we did, we got two coney dogs, fries, and a drink.  The fries were very good, fresh cut, and had the right mixture of crispy and soft fries, and hot from the fryer.  Now the coney dogs were something else, the hot dog itself was good and had a slight crispy skin on it, piled on top was their homemade chili and some mustard.  We loved all of it, and we will definitely be back to try more of their food."}
{"text":"After all the reviews we decided to try this place while in town for the Super Bowl! Delicious chili cheese fries, coney dog, and a good price! I recommend!"}
{"text":"Just moved back to Phoenix and tried out this hot dog place! Good place for some good chili hot dogs! Great service from Chrissy!!"}
{"text":"great Coney dogs and delicious frys, can never go wrong with a chili dog at this place and way cool owner who knows his Detroit sports"}
{"text":"This place felt really greasy and dirty. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Almost lost my appetite. The chilli dog was mediocre. The bun was not good. Tasted like the cheap stuff you get from a bag at the grocery store. The fries were good though. I would have prefered shredded cheese instead of the neon yellow stuff on my chilli cheese fries."}
{"text":"The food was pretty up there with like a Kerbys Coney Island. If you know Michigan you know what I'm saying. It was good not Lafeyette good but good.  I wanted to give the food 4 stars and the price 3 stars. 1 coney dog with tax was like $4.35 for 1 that seems a little aggressive."}
{"text":"This place is great!! My favorite is the fries!! The hot dogs are so good (I recommend getting two if your hungry) I also LOVE the gyro. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm from Detroit! Was born and raised there. When I first seen this place I was like everybody wants to always claim The D's Coney Island restaurant style. On lunch break. I headed over to pick up our order that I called in. I have to give them a thumbs up for coming close if not spot on. It is authentic folks! Dive in!"}
{"text":"So delicious, great price, and quick but doesn't taste like fast food. The coney dog was perfect not greasy, good flavor and they are hand made! Burger has great flavor, and well balanced. The cheese sauce is AMAZING! Love that they offer rewards. The staff was super friendly.  Alma School and Southern"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple more times. Jury duty. At this moment I am in DTW waiting for a plane. Had a coney at National Coney Island. Bun and chili seemed better at Detroit Coney Island!"}
{"text":"First of all, I have always loved Yelp because it never lets me down! So when Yelp says it's good it usually is pretty accurate.  So I came here because of the \"Yelp Top 100 restaurants\" lIst. This place was voted #30 in the nation! Let's just think about this for a second. This is the 30th best place in the nation to eat!? Wow, I gotta go. After looking at the pictures on Yelp I was a bit sceptical I must say, but Yelp has yet to disappoint!  I just went to the #10 place on that list \"Little Miss Bbq\" and had to wait an hour to get in, but it was worth every minute! Amazing! Best food I've ever shoved down my face!  So around noon, an excited and optimistic me walks in to a relatively small place with lots of Detroit memorabilia on the walls and a very friendly girl working the counter. (Her and the staff are the only reason it gets even 3 stars) One person in front of me in line.  (Not a good sign) She said the Coney dog and hamburgers are what they are know for, so that's what I got. I also threw in some chilli cheese fries.  Dogs and burgers are cooked on a flattop and cheese out of a can. Kinda disappointing for the 30th BEST restaurant in the nation, but Yelp has to be right, right? Anyways, food came out fast and correct. Sadly, it was what I thought it would be. Just normal chilli dog and the burger was good but extremely average. My friend made the comment about the chilli, \"reminds me of Sonic chilli\". He was spot on and that's not a good thing. Remember I'm coming to the \"30th BEST PLACE TO EAT IN THE NATION\"!  This isn't the 30th BEST PLACE TO EAT on Broadway, let alone nation! Average might be a stretch, but the service and friendly staff gets it there. If you want a normal strip mall sorta lunch, are from Detroit, have lost all your taste buds in a horrible fire breathing accident from those crazy circus days, you happen to break down on front of this place, only have a few minutes to eat before the tow truck gets there and are really into extremely average food. THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU!  I've lost all faith in humanity and Yelp if this is the \"30th BEST RESTAURANT IN THE NATION\"! I'm now questioning everything I've ever been told in life."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. I lived on Detroit Coneys for 50 years while working in downtown Detroit and going to hundreds of sporting events in Detroit. The coneys at Detroit Coney Grill are exactly what I remember. The hot dogs have that same snap and the chili is the best of any Detroit style Coneys. The big bonus here is that the French fries are better than anything you can get in Detroit. They are hand cut and are the equal of Five Guys. All in all a great meal."}
{"text":"Horrible !! Horrible!! Was craving a Chicago Dog... They only have Detroit Coneys!! What the hell is that anyway?? I got a hot dog with relish, chopped pickles, tomatoes & jalapeños with soggy grease saturated fries.. Disgusting!!! Won't ever go back. Should have gone to the hot dog vendor on the corner"}
{"text":"Great service, inexpensive prices, and nicely prepared meals. For those yearning for Detroit coneys, or like me, curious about what one is like after seeing them on TV, Detroit Coney Grill has exactly what you are looking for.  The menu consists of burgers, hot dogs, pitas, and salads, with some chicken and 3 vegetarian options. I decided on a Detroit coney. The hot dog had a nice \"bite\" to it from the slightly elastic casing, adding a nice textural difference from the rest of the hot dog. The chili was somewhat reminiscent of some Cincinnati style chili I've had from Skyline Chili, except with more of a savory flavor to it. It went well with the onion, mustard, and hot dog.   Service was excellent, and the owner was very friendly and came by to make sure everything was tasting OK.  Hours are a bit limited for those that tend to dine later in the evening since they close at 7:30. Overall though, a great place for some inexpensive quick eats."}
{"text":"I love this place.  From the first visit, I knew this was a joint I would frequent whenever I come to town for work.  In fact, I have my coworker addicted to this place now.  We decided that since this place is so great, it's on the short list of places to go with the company cool kids secret club.    The customer service is great, like really great.  The owner is helladope.  He always has an exuberant greeting, handshake, or hug for me whenever I come in.  The guys behind the counter are always super friendly and helpful.  Didn't know you needed a spoon and ketchup?...don't fret, they knew you did and they'll bring it to you.  The prices are low.  You can fill yourself up to bursting for less than twenty bucks.  There are quite a few things on the menu; but why would you get anything other than the Detroit Coney?  The hot dogs are great.  You know you're eating a good dog when it snaps when you bite into it.  The onions could be a little bit more oniony for me with just a little bit more bite to 'em.  The chili-fries are so so good.  I can feel my arteries clogging with every delicious bite and if I have a fat-girl heart attack on the way out of the door, it'll be worth it.  They also carry a bunch of Faygo, but you need not paint on your ICP face to have any.  I've had a few other things, but it's really all about the hot dogs and fries."}
{"text":"Found Detroit Coney while attending an offsite training in Tempe. Amazing food and management!!  We need one in North Scottsdale, specifically by Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101 :)"}
{"text":"Great food! Forgot about this place with new job it is no longer on the daily route. But brought hubby here for first time today and he was in heaven. Former sports reporter who traveled with Coyotes and Suns to Philadelphia he ordered the Philly Cheese Steak wrap (no mushroom) and he was in heaven. I bet he would rather sleep holding one of those tonight instead of me! Before we left, he was gazing at the menu and announced \" trying to decide what to order when we come back.\" It was great last time I was there and still tasting good."}
{"text":"First time having Coney anything. Some really good stuff here. Went with the Big \"D\" burger with mushrooms, every bite was amazing. Will definitely make the effort to comeback anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I want to start this review with a confirmation, yes I grew up a few miles from Woodward, and grew up with a love of Detroit Coney and red pop.  super happy to have that hometown flavor four blocks from my office.   Their food is fantastic, and really tastes like it did in high school.  However they seem to not pay attention to the order if you are getting it to go... they usually skip bacon if you order it, once they forgot my fries... I don't like paying for food I don't get..."}
{"text":"Just moved from Michigan so GLAD to have a coney AND Faygo Rock & Rye POP!   Thanks Detroit Coney!"}
{"text":"Food worth 5 stars great Coneys...was disappointed in the look of the place. ..seemed disheveled, with paint peeling or worn off...floors already worn too. For a relatively  new place,  it seemed \"old\"."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of eating many Coney dogs in MI over the years. Everyone has their favorite place to indulge. Mine would be Angelo's in the Flint area. There was a tiny part of me hoping they would surprise me with an olive burger but I don't think I saw one on the menu. At any rate, we split the basket since we needed a quickie before a movie down the street. My hubs who has never been to Mi, needed to be introduced to what a Coney was. Be was very impressed! I love this place and I find it comforting too see this little tiny piece of Mi in the desert. I will definitely be back! I discovered Detroit's in the Entertainment Guide. Most of my favorite places were discovered via the Entertainment Guide. I am somewhat new to AZ and there are so many choices. It basically serves as a compass for us. That and Yelp of course. I will be back! #yum Now if we could get our own little Frankenmuth. Awe, good times in Mi. P.S. the Blue Moon made my day to say the least. I snuck the rest into the movie and savored it in the dark. And now I see on FB that they are serving Superman ice cream tomorrow. #memorylane"}
{"text":"Finally an AUTHENTIC Detroit CONEY restaurant in Arizona.    After I left Michigan back in 2005, I thought that I would never have this experience ever again, unless I went home to visit.  But Detroit Coney brought the actual Coney experience to me....and I couldn't be happier.  The Hani is exactly how I remember it...and the chili is the real thing!  (I may be wrong, but I think they ship it in from Detroit....)   The best part, besides the food....is that I am with all of my Michigan peeps when I am there.  There is always somebody to gossip with about Michigan....and in the end it comes to be known that we either know each other or we know the same people.  It is so much fun.  Do NOT go to any other places in AZ that claim to be a Coney Restaurant.  They aren't.  You need the Middle Eastern flair along with it, btw.  And bring your non-MI friends....they will thank you forever for it."}
{"text":"Got the Veggie Pita with beets and tzatziki sauce! Yum!!!! Treated myself to a fountain Dr Pepper, too  I'll be back.  FYI, yelpers, I scored 10% off my next check here when I checked in!"}
{"text":"My friend from Michigan has always been raving about this place and today I tagged along with him.  I'm sure glad I made that choice!  This place was amazing!  We both got the Mack-Inaw burger and it was HUGE and DELICIOUS!  The burger tasted amazingly fresh and was super filling.  My buddy got the Faygo soda and he said that it reminded him of being back home.  The decor of this place is old school with many many Michigan themed artwork and street signs.    This was a refreshing change from all of the big local chains.  I will be back!  Return factor 100%"}
{"text":"First time visiting Detroit Coney Grill.   What a great find. Admittedly, my family likes Teds, but this place is awesome as well. Detroit, MI type of hot dog style with lots of great flavor and freshness. Service is the BEST! This place has the best customer service. It's like walking into Cheers. Owner is your cashier and everyone seems to be having fun.   Some foot notes, this place is not a vegan/low carbs type place. However, if you want a great dog or burger and a great atmosphere, you should consider this as your goto place."}
{"text":"I'm between a 3 and 4. Probably 3.5.  Burger was good. Tried my husbands coney dog and it was cold and the dog seemed plasticky. The service was good. The fries were good. Onion rings ok. The double burger is good with 1000 island on it. My son really enjoyed his burger too. The hot dog was the big disappointment. It seemed a little pricey for fast food. I would go back."}
{"text":"This place is great. Burgers are phenomenal. Coneys are great. Staff is super friendly. Definitely a place for great food"}
{"text":"We moved to Arizona from the Detroit metro area 10 years ago and have been waiting for a place like this. It was delicious!! We couldn't decide what to get, so we got a few items to split. The coneys were great - rivaled any coney joint in michigan. The chicken pita was fantastic- get it with feta! My favorite were the fries. They make them fresh right there and you can really tell. The owner was friendly and welcoming, and all of the staff was helpful and had smiles. We live in Queen Creek and would LOVE one of these in the south east valley!! We will definitely be back- keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!  Ok, for starters. Anyone who has lived on the east coast, knows about Penn Station Subs. And you know how YUMMY their cheesesteak is. You also know, that there is NOWEHRE in the valley, that makes a cheesesteak that tastes remotely close to Penn Station...  UNTILL I tried Detroit Coney Grill.  While they don't make the sub version, their cheesesteak pita is a fine substitute...and the cheesesteak tastes JUST like Penn Station.  My ex-wife has been in the valley over 4 years, and was unable to find a cheesesteak like Penn Station.  Im glad I found Detroit Coney Grill!!  Now, as far as everything else goes..YUMMY!!  I have been trying to find someplace around that makes a chili similar to Tommys...and this is it.  The burger patties ARE small, but that's ok.  Get a triple, with chili..and you are SET!  The dogs DO have that familiar snap when you bite them.  I love the cheese sauce the use for the chili cheese fries...and the psudeo-Maid Rite loose meat they use for some of the menu items is delish as well!!  Imagine a tray of fries, covered in loose meat, then smothered in chili, then topped with cheese sauce.  GOOG GAWD MAN!  The owner and employees are super nice.   I had ordered a chicken philly pita with no mushrooms..but after the rest of my family had ordered, the owner, who was taking our order, had forgotten to subtract the mushrooms.  So when he saw me picking the mushrooms out, he apologized. Later, as we were finishing up, he came out from back with a bowl, that had 4 scoops of their Superman Ice cream...free of charge!  It kinda sucks, that now I have found this amazing place, I have to move up off of Happy Valley Rd.  Its ok. it wont stop me from coming back.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"First time here at Detroit Coney Grill. Here's my review.....  Service: 5/5 the staff is VERY friendly and accommodating, everyone went out of their way to greet us and make us feel welcomed. (:  Food: 4/5 my mom got the gyro and I got a coney no onion, and we shared fries. The hotdog really does have a great snap to it. Fries are hand cut and fresh.   Great neighborhood spot, will come back again."}
{"text":"The salad wasn't impressive. The burger patties are ridiculously small. The food was cooked well and it was as close to home that Ive had so far. Great service as well. Clean dining area."}
{"text":"Have spent over 9 years looking for A good Detroit style Coney Hot Dog in Arizona, and here it is. Great Chili but the Hot Dog lacked the snap i'm used to. Still A 10 in my book."}
{"text":"Chili doesn't have much flavor. The Whole meal wasn't too bad, might come back to try another menu item. Nice people decent service, just didn't hit the spot."}
{"text":"Outstanding Coney Island!!!  I'm from Detroit and live in the SF Bay Area, and while in Phoenix I stumbled upon a GENUINE Motor City Coney Island restaurant!!  Various Michigan teams were well represented with sports memorabilia everywhere and very cool t-shirts for sale.  The service was incredibly friendly and the food absolutely delicious.   I had a nice Vernors Ginger Ale, too.  Ah, it was just like home.  To top it off there is a floor mat at the register, and when I looked down to see what it said, I laughed out loud as it was an Ohio State Buckeye floor mat, all nice and dirty from being stepped on by many Michiganders!!  GO BLUE!   :)  It was nice to be with my People!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal!!  The food is what mid-west is all about!!  If you want great mid-western style burgers and dogs this is the place to go!!  They sell pop in the bottle!  Old school Faygo!  This is the place to go!!! The staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"It's so nice to have some of my favorite foods brought to AZ! I loved the burger and the owner is so friendly, it's great to see him interact so enthusiastically with his customers about the food."}
{"text":"Never been do excited to see a restaurant. I grew up in Detroit and dinning at Cony island was a staple. Just as I remember. I bought a $100.00 package deal for my husband as a surprise for his birthday. It came with ALL the fixings. Met the owner. He was so very nice and is staff....they were Rock Star. Even purchased \"Better Maid\" potato chips. They  had \"Fago\" soda pop. The restaurant is 2 1/2 hour ride from my house. I will visit every time I go to phoenix!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Moved to Arizona 10 years ago and missed coney dogs and Better Made chips ever since. Along comes the Coney Grill with authentic Detroit style food and brands. As long as the doors are open I will be a customer of this establishment. Awesome owners. Customers are unlike any other place as they often start conversations amongst themselves. Guess we are all just proud to be from the great city of Detroit."}
{"text":"I have been eating coneys (with) since I was a wee lad getting drawn into Lafayette with a wrapping fork on a glass pane window. However I have never gotten the advice to give a Loose Combo a try, which the congenial  owner of DCG (Dave) did.  Since that day Coney and Loose Combo is the only thing I order.  States volumes about the owner, who is pedaling a quality product, but wants to maximize every customers experience.  Great food and service.  Nice to have a bit of the taste of home here in Arizona."}
{"text":"Great homemade food. Great service. Awesome coneys, gyros and burgers. All burgers are ground on site, incredibly fresh!"}
{"text":"Killer burgers! The fries were fantastic too. But what made it greatest was that the owner took the time to sit down and and talk Sports. I will come back - from American Fork, UT"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while. Job location changed but I'm back in the vicinity. Glad to be back in the neighborhood. Chilly cheese dog mustard and onions!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat in Tempe. The food is fantastic and always fresh, the service is Great, and David, what can I say about David?!!, along with his crew are absolutely amazing!! Check it out, you'll never regret it!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best coney in AZ. Their burgers are even better. The staff is very friendly and it really is s joy to eat there.great job Dave!!  Jim (squared )"}
{"text":"Food reminds me of family and food back in Michigan. That being said is the coney the best I have ever had? No, but it's still pretty darn good. And when I want a Coney and a Faygo when I am in the downtown area this is a top pick for me."}
{"text":"Wow. You should go. V dope. V good. Good service v v friendly. Have a good time and a good food. Cultural and relevant. Easy to bite."}
{"text":"Definitely better chili on the coney dogs than the prior restaurant that was in this spot, but not anything rave worthy.  I think $4.28 is a little high for a coney, but they did have some combos.  I ordered take out and they were really fast, which was good.  I'll give them another try for sure."}
{"text":"When i found this place i couldnt believe my eyes! REAL coney dogs right in Tempe. They got Faygo pop, bettermade chips, and that Detroit personality that i love and miss. Ill be back here again and again"}
{"text":"Wife had gyros and it was ok. It was a nice touch adding Feta cheese crumbles, but there was too much. The tomatoes all had to be picked off because they were white on the edges and didn't look right. I didn't see the gyros meat coming from a spit which always makes me nervous. The fries weren't as good as I remembered. The double cheeseburger I had was pretty good. The service was good. It was nice seeing the owner laughing and joking with his employees."}
{"text":"Man they are ripping people off with that high dollar coneys i was born and raised in michigan and coneys are only 1.29 they charging 4 dollars for one faygo in mi is .89cent and they charging 2 dollars they up charging like a mf"}
{"text":"Great service. Prompt and the big mackinaw is the best. Their fresh cut fries are delicious."}
{"text":"I LOVE Detroit Coney. Dogs have snap...which to those of you aficionados that know...absolutely MATTERS... Nothing like a killer chili dog with onions and a bottle of Faygo to make the midday drudgery go away...."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write a review for this place for months just now getting around to it. The food is good for a quick lunch or a cheap pre game/event dinner. But today I came in in the mood for chili, to which I was told I could only eat in because it wasn't available to go then and when I got it, it was cold. Kinda turned me off to coming back for a while, overall I would give them a solid 3. The interior is very small and the setup makes maneuvering around difficult but if you're in the mood for a quick lunch that's not your average cold cut sandwich, this is your place."}
{"text":"With all of the hamburger and hot dog places clustered in Tempe, it takes a lot to stand out.  Detroit Coney Grill has that special something.  The patties in their burgers are thin, but they offer a \"quint\" or five patty burger that is like a double burger elsewhere.  Absolutely fresh, delicious, and juicy.  Order it any way you like and you'll get it to your table quick and with a smile.  Want more food?  You can get more patties--order 18 if you like and eat 'em if you can.  ASU students please take note--wanna do your own \"Man vs. Food?\"  Here's a delicious spot to do it!  Fries are fresh cut and tasty, and drinks are bottomless.    One of the top burgers in Tempe--TRY IT."}
{"text":"Originally from Detroit, was feeling homesick and this is the only place that has authentic Detroit coneys. Anyone else who makes a coney and says they get their ingredients from MI doesn't mean they know how to make a coney. Coney Grill is Lafayette style straight from Detroit  Hands down, my most favorite restaurant. If you're thinking about going, you're overthinking it, JUST GO!!! IT'S AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the place on a whim. It was excellent. Best coneys I've had. Owner was great to talk to. I would certainly recommend and will visit again when I have the chance."}
{"text":"I revisited recently. Must say it is much more pleasant without the owner yelling at his wife.  Also like having multiple choices on the pop machine. Still good tasting food,"}
{"text":"We were in the area and found them in Yelp.  I wanted to try something different and had the double burger with loose ground beef .  I asked for just ketchup and pickles and ketchup and they added lettuce which I detest.  But just Picked it off.  The loose beef was under seasoned so I added salt.  Otherwise meal was fine.  The fries are extra crunchy and almost on verge of burnt but I think that's the style and I actually liked them.  I dipped the leftover fries in salsa when I got home and yum.   If we are in that area again I'd like to try something different and increase my rating .  I'm all about giving restaurants more than one chance if possible to visit them."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  The owner is worth dropping by for, he was personable and cared about us having a good experience at his restaurant.  This is the real reason why we'll be coming back.   The Greek salad, and the personable nod from the charmng owner, is worth the trip.  We will be back.  Loved the salad, but the owner said there were beets on the salad (yay) but when we actually were served the salad...no beets.  Still loved the salad, tho. I've been searching for a decent Greek salad for years, and this place really served it up good. yay!     Coney Islands were overpriced and unimpressionable.  $3.95 a  small coney island. They resemble \"Sonic\" chili dogs that I can get down the street for $1 or less.  My family paid, for a party of 4, $44, ($50 w/tip), which included, 2 bottles of Faygo, and a small bag of chips we brought home., We can do that just about anywhere, so the incentive to drive 30 minutes is just not quite there.  Kudos for this place for serving, Better Made potato chips, they weren't what I remember.  Better Made, changed their oil to the 'non trans fat' stuff, just not the same. However, we ordered the Fries and they were fabulous, the real deal.   I'd buy a lot more Faygo from this establishment,  if was sold sold just a tad bit less expensive.  Faygo, is the BEST,  My family paid, for a party of 4, $44, ($50 w/tip);  which included, 2 bottles of Faygo, and a small bag of chips we brought home., We can do that just about anywhere, so the incentive to drive 30 minutes is just not quite there.  Overall, nice experience and I hope to return there"}
{"text":"As I walked in, immediately a familiarity washed over me. The smells, the sights of the blue, orange and white. - David introduces himself to me, and I am proud to say I live in Tucson by way of Clarkston. He gives me a white push pin to place on the map on the wall. - I feel welcomed. - normally a gal from Clarkston would be laughed at and never accepted as \"from\" Detroit, but not here. - here we are all Detroit. Here you can tell by the passion of the way David speaks on how he had to deliver the coney to these parts, if you even know someone in the mitten, you are Detroit. - I ordered 3 chili mustard onion coneys, and regular fries. -David seems saddened as I tell him it's to go because a sleeping baby and a husband in the car. - he wanted my first bite reaction in person - I order a faygo grape and he immediately opens it and allows me to have that sweet 100% cane sugar pop before I pay. A robust smile as he is satisfied by my reaction. - I am in the car, I open my dog. The aroma is right on. Reminds me of home, Kirby's, Pete's, National, and every Greek restaurant coney in between. - I notice the softeness of the steamed bun. - I bring it to my lips and the taste of fresh diced onions, sweet chili, and the snap of the dog. I question, is this a kowalski? No, maybe a koegel? Deliciousness ensues. And then it's gone. - perfect. Just like home."}
{"text":"Went at lunchtime on a weekday - there was a line but it went very quickly. Reasonably priced - double cheeseburger with fries and drink for $8. Food was very tasty!  Burger patties are super thin, so order several if you like thicker meat. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"AH-MAZING! Haven't had legit Detroit coneys since I moved here in 05, they were SO good. We drove from Glendale to come eat here,  that's how good it was. Also the owner came back while we were finishing up, said hello and shook our hands, super nice guy. I recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"So, so good! The food, the hospitality and the prices. The chili was awesome as were the dogs and fries. Loved finding this treasure before flying back to Washington. Would love to see a franchise in the Vancouver area!! Give it a try-you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, fries, and chili dogs! My favorite is the buffalo chicken pita. Wonderful service as well."}
{"text":"The food is great, the place is clean and the staff is friendly!  Next time you're headed to Teds, stop in at the Detroit Coney Grill.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"great food, and the manager will come check up on you personally unless they are slammed. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"OMG, can't figure this one out for the life of me.   Fresh cut fries - soggy  All beef hot dog - mushy Double cheeseburger - minuscule and tasteless   Not to mention filthy and unfriendly.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Tried to go here while attending a conference in August. While the food smelled great, just standing in line for several minutes was too much due to the weak air conditioning. Hope to check this place out during late Fall or Winter."}
{"text":"Awesome little fast food spot, dogs have a nice snap and great flavor, chili is delicious, burger has a great flat top char, sauteed onions are delicious and the fries are think, but still crispy. Highly recommend for an awesome inexpensive lunch spot"}
{"text":"I have to come here to get a taste of home. The next best thing to growing up a block from Tony Pacos."}
{"text":"The food is good but the girls that work there are what keeps me from going back. So damn rude with ugly attitudes."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to some awesome coney dogs and was meet with slightly bland chilli on a bland dog. It was a real disappointment for me. It gets a 2 out of 5, cause I liked the fries. Not really sure I'd recommend this place.   The service was good, but not enough to overcome the blandness of those dogs. Also, for what they charged it should have been much better then that. They made Circle K's hot dogs look good."}
{"text":"Top 3 best chili cheese fries I've ever had  Burgers are amazing  Chili couldn't be better   Staff is always super cool."}

{"text":"Great food, great customer service.  I've had the burgers, chicken, pitas, and fries....all wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Time for a Detroit Coney Dog Run  I love these gems: restaurants in Phoenix where people bring the flavors of their home towns to you. What's more, they do it with so much passion, that they shine in a crowded sea of foodie options.   Adding DCG to my Yelp! list after seeing it highlighted for its top reviews, I noticed I was nearby after a morning meeting in the area. Decided to drop in for lunch.   Staff was super friendly from the moment I walked in the door. The owner (I think) was engaging with folks and teaching a new employee as she helped me-- totally friendly and supportive of her as she figured things out, which was cool to see. I wasn't going to order my dogs Coney style, but they prodded/teased me into it. Glad they did. The chili, mustard, and onions isn't normally something I'd go for, but it was a great combo with the hotdog. And their fries are good!  Dogs and burgers aren't haute cuisine. And that's the point. The only things that matter are if its tasty as heck and if you have fun while eating. You'll get that, here.   A cool place to visit and revisit..."}
{"text":"I was craving a coney today so I hit up yelp once again. I can say it didn't let me down as I had their daily special, which is 2 coney dogs, fries, and a drink.

{"text":"THIS IS THE ONLY LEGIT CONEY ISLAND RESTAURANT IN ARIZONA!!!!!!!!!! THIS PLACE IS THE BEST!!!   There are so many fradulent  \"coney islands\" around town, and it was getting very annoying going to so many and being let down.   This place is truly authentic! The Coney Dogs come just how they should, with amazing chilli, loaded with onion and mustard, and most importantly...NO KETCHUP ON THE CONEY DOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol. Love them, reminds me of home, any time I have a coney dog craving I go here.  Definitely a part of DETROIT'S FINEST!  they need to open more locations, especially in MARICOPA!!!!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Everyone is super friendly from the cashier to the cooks. The prices are very reasonable as well. The food was awesome, I got the Big D burger and my fiancé a Buffalo Chicken Pita. Both were on point, and were served within a few minutes of ordering them. Both were cook perfectly and put together really well. The Big D burger could have gotten really sloppy really quick but surprisedly didn't at all. Overallawesome place, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Welcome home! Legit Detroit style coney with damn good chilli, hani's, faygo and better made chips! Feels just like home except the coneys aren't 99 cents and they close at 7pm. Eat here, its worth EVERY penny! Fast, friendly and most importantly BOMB.COM. I seriously cannot believe how good the chilli cheese fries are... and they're not stingy with serving size :)"}
{"text":"Detroit What! Might as well close your eyes bite down feel the snap and go into the \"D\" it's very good. If you can't be in Detroit you might as well come have the best dogs in the WEST. Nothing is better. Chili is great. The place takes Detroiters back home."}
{"text":"Ok so I have never had a \"coney dog\" and it is this places saving grace had chilly dog burger and chilly cheese fries. Chilly dog awesome very good. Burger was very small pattie with no patty flavor. Chilly cheese fries worst part of the meal the fries were almost burnt and cheese sauce was flavor less I could not even eat them. I would recommend for coney dogs only"}
{"text":"Once again I'm  in awe. .. can't wait til they come up to Peoria! !!! Staff is super friendly. Makes me feel like I'm at home in Detroit. Always get a chance to talk with the owner. His heart is in everything they do and it shows. Thanks y'all!"}
{"text":"Super good dog, piping hot and great service! I'll return. The chili is really tasty!"}
{"text":"I didn't have the best first experience but I will be back. I ordered a salad, which was a little watery at the bottom. The grilled chicken on the Greek salad though was marinated well. I wasn't sure what the chunk was in my salad dressing, but it turns out it was feta. The dressing wasn't very flavorful for being made with fresh olives and feta.  Halfway through my salad, I found a hair in my salad- not mine. The person I ate with bought the Monday special that had a Detroit coney, a drink, and chili cheese fries. I did not try the dog, but I had some of the fries and it was delicious. The diet drinks were all out when we arrived. After asking them about it two times they finally changed it. They did apologize and gave us two gift certificates to come back and give them another try. We will."}
{"text":"Took my bride to my favorite coney spot!! Always great coneys, great fries, great faygo and great service!!! Excited about the rumor I heard of a bell road possibility!!!  Getting dangerously close to my place!!!! Keep em' coming Dave!!!"}

I have had some 'coneys' here in the west and they usually miss on the 'dog' not Detroit Coney Grill  they appear to have the natural skin casings  that give you that 'snap' when you bite into them, fresh onions, great coney sauce  everything that is great about Detroit you will find here!!  I plan to be back soon and try their burgers they look great as well.  And did I mention FAYGO?!?!  in the bottle  nothing like Faygo!!  great spot  hope they expand to the westside soon!!"}
{"text":"We're from Southern California so I'll start by saying..were used to extremely rude people and very basic food. This place gives me hope for society. The workers are very nice and the food is good.   Hospitality? A+.  Food? A+. Price? A+.  There were 6 of us and our food took less than 10 minutes. Their boxed water is to die for and their faygo pops are great as well. Detroit feeling in Arizona you can't beat it. They gave us some chips to try as well that were great. We would definitely come back...unless they opened one in CALIFORNIA!!!! Hehe. Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I felt like I was back at home. Only place besides Detroit that got the chili and the ranch right! -Scottsdale"}
{"text":"If you're from MI, this is going to bring you back! Stopped in for lunch and left very satisfied. The chili was spot on! The cheese fries were really good too!   I dug into my lunch and forgot to get a pic, but I've added a pic of my boyfriend's coney combo.   The owner spoke with us and said he gets all his goodies straight from MI. We'll definitely be back here and plan on recommending it to all our friends from MI!"}
{"text":"These guys are doing it right!!! Smple, fresh ingredients done right. Double cheeseburger, fries and a coke for 8 bucks is a bargain for this quality. Fresh ground beef and a toasted bun is what did it for me. Yum! Gonna come back soon for a coney!"}
{"text":"I always either have a friend bring me  a brick of chili or I buy it when I visit  Michigan. I love coneys.  I enjoyed going to the DCG.  The owner made it a fun place to visit.  Had a Vernors which was great and two coney dogs.  I downgraded them only because the coneys were in a basket and not on a plate.  By the end of eating the second dog I was eating the plastic paper.  Please get plates and silverware."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 10 times now.  I try to bring someone new every time.  CONSISTENTLY, this food is excellent.  What blows my mind more than anything else about Detroit Coney is the staff.  From the big chief to the crew that cooks the food.  Everyone is wonderful and treats you like family.  I've never felt that an employee feels like an \"employee\" I think they feel like they are part of something bigger.  As a business owner myself, I try to make my employees feel the same way.  They are bigger than just one of my employees, they are part of this business.......    The man in charge treats everyone like he's known them for years.  Whether he genuinely remembers me and my family when we walk in those doors, he sure makes us feel like we're a long distant family member that he hasn't seen in years.  It feels good to walk into an establishment and get that kind of attention.  He's upfront, honest and OPEN to any and all suggestions.  He wants nothing more than the spirit of Michigan to creep into this desert town.  As for naysayers who may bitch that this establishment isn't the real deal, that it doesn't serve breakfast, that the prices are higher here than in Michigan.... use some common sense!  It's a small place.  All roads that lead to Phoenix have signs that say \"steep grades\"  To a truck driver, that means higher price of delivery.  To a business owner, that means, cost of goods go up.  Ever wonder why huge bands NEVER play Arizona?  This restaurant is practically importing 50% of it's menu to give his customers the food they are unable to get ANYWHERE else in this state.  It's going to cost more.  As a business owner, I wrap my brain around their price on goods and salary vs profit.    Detroit Coney Grill I would imagine is just a stepping stone to a bigger picture.  Something tells me one day Arizona will get the full blown Coney it deserves and it's all thanks to Detroit Coney Grill.  If I was a millionaire, I'd beg DCG to let me invest."}
{"text":"The place was dirty and the food was cold. There was only myself and my husband in the  restaurant.  Being from Detroit, we looked forward to going for a good Coney dog. Should have known better. Nothing like the original."}
{"text":"Please stop giving this place good reviews! Just because you ate dog food back home in Detroit doesn't mean it's good! It smelt like a portapoty inside and I walked out literally smelling like a fry cook. If you decide to eat there please make sure you eat outside. You might enjoy your dog food a little bit more."}
{"text":"I lived in Detroit for awhile and I always ate at Coney Island , when I moved back to Arizona I tried all the coney islands here and they all were terrible . I came to Detroit Coney Island in Tempe for the first time 05/22/15 and after trying the chili cheese fries I knew they were an actual Detroit Coney Island . I found my home here in Az and I will be coming here ALL THE TIME . I give 10 stars to this place ! Thank you ! And I live in Verrado 45 mins west of Tempe ! The owner is super friendly !"}
{"text":"If you are from Michigan and you are trying to get your Coney fix, this place is exactly what you are looking for. I lived in Michigan for a year and had my share of Coney's and Detroit Coney Island hits the spot. I live in North Phoenix and make it a point to drive into Tempe once a month to get my Coney.   The owner is super nice and his staff shows excellent customer service. I can only hope that he opens a store closer to camelback and central so I don't have to travel so far to grab a Coney;)"}
{"text":"Quick and easy no fuss food. Very friendly staff. Solid burger. Ordered a triple with cheese. Each beef patty is 2oz, ground in house and smashed flat. This leads to more grilled surface area per burger increasing flavor, but also a tougher texture as it ends up cooked through thoroughly. Super soft sesame seed buns was a plus! Natural cut fries that were a little soft and in-and-out like, but thicker. Next time I will get them fried well. Overall, very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Good food. People were really nice! Customer service was great. Food was pretty good. Never been to Detroit, so I can't really compare."}
{"text":"Want a taste of New York  coney dogs I've never been but I can imagine that this is how it would taste, The Detroit coney  with chilli  and the Philly cheese steak  were the best, The owner and his crew are top notch customer  service professionals stop in and see what I mean  Thanks guys you were the best Rick Lane  North phoenix"}
{"text":"I will start by saying I enjoyed the food and will be going to the establishment again. With that being said, I wasn't a huge fan of the hot dogs exactly but I loved the chili, the bun and everything else...perhaps just could've been a one time thing so no big deal. I loved every part about the hani; excellent idea and the flavors all blend together. More than likely will order the hani everytime I go.  Plenty of parking, and the hours were normal. Plenty of seating inside but I took to go. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Legit Detroit Coneys. Eat with Faygo Rock N' Rye.  Detroit Coney's are legendary in D town. Hot dogs are good quality with Detroit's own take on Coney chili. Fast and friendly service and a great way to get in touch with your inner Midwestern. Casual fast food environment."}
{"text":"I'm from Michigan and they definitely nailed it for me. The loose was not up to my standard, but overall was happy and excited. Can't wait to visit again to try out the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers and coneys! Great price and friendly service! It's a great lunch spot!!"}
{"text":"The cheese fries are amazing. Prices are decent. My only complaint is that I think the coneys would be better if the onions were cooked. Next time I'll skip the onions and be completely satisfied"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Was visiting Tempe for Spring Training when we stumbled across this little gem! My husbands eyes immediately saw the sign \"Best Burger in Town\" and was sold.  We came in, the staff was super nice, restaurant was clean and the food was the cherry on top! I ordered the Chicken Philly Pita (I don't eat beef or pork - luckily there is many Pita options!) it was AMAZING! I literally tried to finish the whole thing so I didn't waste a bite even if I was full. As for my husbands burger -- he was in love. He said the beef was high quality and was grilled perfectly. The fries were cooked to perfection and a great compliment to our entree. I recommend this place to anyone in the area that loves Great quality food at a great price!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the dizzy is about this place unless your from MI I suppose. Nothing special about a chili hot dog with home made fries.  Not great but not bad!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for my lunch breaks, the owner is so friendly and really involved with his customers. Nothing like supporting a small business where you can tell the owner is excited about his business. The owner made me and my coworker Greek fries although they are not on the menu and went above and beyond."}
{"text":"Yes, this is as good as it gets.  Let me explain... Detroit Coney Grill is no more than a little hot dog and hamburger place in a strip shopping center - at least that's how it looks.  It is a basic, simple place that serves a basic menu of various hot dogs and hamburgers.  But as a little of a foodie, let me explain where the \"basic\" gets lost behind the quality of what they serve.  This little place is gradually getting some well deserved national recognition for the quality of their hot dogs and hamburgers.  Let's begin with the hot dogs.  For an affordable price, they serve their own recipe, custom-made hot dogs which, according to the owner, have a little middle eastern spicing in them, which gives them what he called \"that little snap.\"  They have a Detroit Coney Combo Dog which is that hot dog served in a fresh steamed bun, and topped with crumbled beef (their recipe), and chili (again, their recipe).  It is just good.  Better than Nathans, Hebrew National, Vienna Brand, etc.  Perhaps there are better local hot dogs that I don't know about, but these are definitely some of the best I've had in many years.  Remember, this place doesn't have exotic items.  They do a very good job of serving great hot dogs and hamburgers.  I am also a french fry snob.  I am always on the hunt for proper french fries with that proper texture that can only be gotten be soaking them, parboiling them, etc.  I am not an expert on how to do it right.  I just know that when they are done right, they taste right, and with the right texture.  They definitely have it all.  I also hate french fries that are either batter dipped or covered with other strange spices - I am a purist.  I like really good, pure, french fries.  And Detroit Coney Grill has them.  I live in the Austin, Texas area, and only come to Phoenix area once or twice a year on business.  And every trip, a visit to Detroit Coney Grill is mandatory - because of their food.  This trip, I learned that they are supposed to have some great hamburgers as well.  So today, I finally tried one.  I got a double cheeseburger with bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Nothing special (not gimmicky).  But the burger meat (which they fresh grind on premises) was \"melt-in-your-mouth.\"  Really, really good.  Very simple, but perfectly done.  In conversations with the owner, I've learned that an important focus for him is doing every little detail correctly, every time, by everyone who works there.  This, I believe will be a formula for long term success.   The place is not impressive looking - the atmosphere is just pleasantly simple.  The prices are quite reasonable.  The service is consistently very friendly and good.  And I have already said that the food is just consistently good.  I hope if the owner reads this review, he remembers that there are fans in Austin waiting for a Detroit Coney Grill to open in central Texas.  Looking forward to seeing one (maybe more) of these coming to Austin area in the near future."}
{"text":"Damn good burgers, freshly-ground beef every day, damn good dogs, and Faygo. If you're missing your Coney fix, these guys are doing it right. The fries are great, the food is fast, and everyone is extremely nice, even on the crazed opening day we came in for the tail end of. Do yourself a favor and swing on by."}
{"text":"Went for our first time today man I felt like I went back home for 30 min! The coneys, better made, and Faygo hit the spot!! To top it off the owner was there to make sure everything was on point and even told us about the superman ice cream they have! This place hit home brought back my childhood memories for sure!! Please open a west valley location we're in surprise/ el mirage!! Thanks again"}
{"text":"Best coneys, burgers and salads around! It's like a piece of home for me and my family! We love Dave(the owner) and all of the employees!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Michigan Coneys... Absolutely fantastic. I want to try their burgers but the coneys are so good. A must stop every time I am in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The best service I've seen since I've been in AZ! Fast, friendly, and great food! If you are a burger person go give them a try! It was fantastic! The customer service was excellent they make you feel at home."}
{"text":"What up doe?! Save the money on a flight to Detroit and just come here for the best coney in town! I can't wait for the next locations to pop up around Phoenix! Probably the most outgoing staff you will find in any restaurant. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Good tasting hot dogs and I got a Faygo Red Pop.  The owner was nice and came around to talk with every table."}
{"text":"I am from Detroit and these hot dogs are the real thing.  I was so excited and have been back twice."}
{"text":"Chili dogs with mustard & an insane amount of onions with a side of fries.    It's alright. It's a good hot dog, but at the end of the day, it's still a hot dog.  Better than weinerschnitzel type chains, but that isnt saying much now is it.   Price was fair.   Service was adequate.  The restaurant is filthy.  The tables needed a cleaning.  Small pieces of trash randomly all over the floor.    As a Detroit lions fan I appreciate that they have an attachment to the teams of Detroit.  Maybe if they started selling beer & showing lions, tigers, & pistons games this could be a spot for sports fans."}
{"text":"OMG this place is awesome... You have to try it. The weekday specials are great. Any place that the line goes out the door is a good sign the food is good"}
{"text":"Man, This is the real deal.  I discovered this last night and then took my entire office out for lunch there today.  These are the REAL hot dogs!  I grew up eating these things.  The owner is super energetic and friendly.  The fries were outstanding, but for me?  A Coney Dog is a taste of \"Michigan Soul Food\" and DCG has it.  If you grew up in South East Michigan you will want to get in your car and head over there now.  I can't believe I am so lucky that this is right down the street from where I work."}
{"text":"Super friendly Place very welcoming. The owner is super friendly. While eating our meals we saw a steady stream of people visiting this eatery.  I  just love the open kitchen.   My husband and daughter had the 2 chili cheese dogs,  fries and a drink special, and I had the triple Burger and it was all so delicious.   We will definately be back again."}
{"text":"Owner came to bring us some delicious burgers! I'm from Detroit and it's really hard to impress me when it comes to burgers but these were simply amazing! Reminds me of home exactly!"}
{"text":"If you're from Detroit, you will love this place. Nothing like two on one, chili fries and a Vernors!!"}
{"text":"Excellent quick hot food. I had the coney dog, fries and a pop. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I honestly don't even know where to begin with this place. Some backstory though - my family and I are all from Warren, MI and we've been in AZ since 04'  I originally walked past the downtown location and ended up finding the Tempe location online. To begin, when you walk in, there's a cool map on the wall of Michigan (and if you're from there, you vs. place a pin on the map according to the city you're from) Dave, the owner, is a very welcoming guy. The dude KNOWS how to run a business. He loves all of his guests. Such a Detroit kind of guy! But down to the main topic- Food. Absolutely incredible. It's JUST like being back home. They serve Faygo pop and Better Made potato chips, too! I'm impressed that they were able to bring something so sacred to Michiganers here to Arizona (And pull it off successfully!)  (P.S Build us a location in Paradise Valley, will ya?)"}
{"text":"As a Livonia native,  i love this place but wish it wasn't so far.  Would like to see one in South Chandler!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW.  This restaurant delivers a little taste of home in the desert.  Being from the Detroit area, I was skeptical of how well they would portray this Detroit tradition.  The chili was spot on.  The hot dogs were just as good, if not better, than what you get back home.  And the 'Hani' was better than most in Michigan.  The owner (Dave?) was very welcoming and passionate about the business.  Overall, great experience.  They surely brought Pure Michigan to the Valley."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with my friend and he suggested Coney Grill. I loved it! Great service, awesome food and a fancy soda machine! I got a Double burger because the pattys are small - 2 ounces and the burger was perfect for me! Also the fresh cut fries are super yummy! Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Stopped here and was impressed with the staff and the food! Everyone who works here is proud of how good the food is and it shows. Mostly everything here is fresh and made in house. I don't like chili but the chili here was so good, more of a meatsauce with middle eastern flair. The hot dog was mild and the cheese sauce on it was so good. My boyfriend got a triple burger and loved every bite. Glad to see a place that is so good and that really cares about what customers think."}
{"text":"Well unfortunately I don't have a lot of good stuff to say about this place. The cashier was really flustered by an upset customer on the phone, it look like she went to reprimand the cooks while on the phone with customer. It was a VERY BUSY place so I can kind of understand her being a little overwhelmed but the food wasn't with all of that hassle! The coney dog was only ok, the burger was delicious! The fries are amazing, delicious, freshly cut in house, so PERFECT!! I'd go back for a burger & fries but not a coney"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars.  Tempe=Hot Dog Paradise!  3 great hot dog joints all within 5 miles of each other.  Decisions, decisions!  How would Detroit Coney Grill stack up?  Pretty damn well as you are about to find out!  I had driven by this place a few times but was always on my way down the street to Ted's.  When I woke up this morning, I was craving a hot dog (Twice in less than a week).  I decided to drive on down and see what Detroit Coney Grill was all about.  I had never had a \"Coney Dog\" before today either.  I was browsing their website and noticed that they had a Wednesday special which was 2 Coney Dogs, Fries and a Fountain Drink for $8.88.  Sounded like a plan.  I drove down, parked and walked in.  Right when I walked in, I was greeted by a couple of the workers.  I also noticed that the owner (one of the owners?) was behind the counter talking with the staff and shootin the shit.  I went up to the register and placed my order for the Wednesday Special.  My total was $9.40.  I paid the lady my money, grabbed my cup for my drink and was on the way over to the Coke machine.  While I was making my way over to get my drink, the owner guy walked up to me, asked me how I was doing and shook my hand.  I thought that was really cool and it shows that he appreciates his customers!  I grabbed my soda from the awesome Freestyle Coke Machine and took a seat.  While I was sitting there, I noticed that the owner was talking shop with every single customer in the joint.  He was explaining how they grind their own beef for their burgers, make their own chili, giving recommendations to customers etc etc.  Really personable dude!  A few minutes later, my number was called and I grabbed my stuff.  Here is how it was................  Coney Dogs-  These dogs come topped with their homemade Coney Sauce aka chili, onions and mustard.  This chili is ladled on top of a natural casing dog and nestled inside of a steamed hot dog bun.  The chili kind of reminded me of a Tommy's type chili (CA folks know what I'm talking about).  It had plenty of spices in it and had a great flavor and texture.  I really enjoyed it!  The mustard and onions worked well too and the bun was super soft.  Great snap to the dogs, too!  These 2 dogs were mighty fine!  Fries-  Fresh cut fries!  They were salted perfect, fried perfect and flat out some of the best hand cut fries I have had in quite some time.  Decent sized portion, too!  After I was done with my meal, I was going back to the Coke machine to get a refill for the road.  I ran into the owner again and he asked me how everything was and gave me a fist bump.  I can't remember a time when I received such great customer service at a place...seriously!   I will be back just because of that!  Great dogs, great fries and amazing hospitality make this a joint I can definitely see myself coming back to eventually."}
{"text":"As always Dave served up the best coneys and had superman ice cream today!   Great burgers and made to order frys."}
{"text":"Brought my husband and step daughters here to experience the Detroit vibe and food I miss. Great down to earth service with a little Detroit humor from the nice lady who took our order. The coneys were awesome, we all loved the fresh spiral fries and we got a six pack of Faygo. I was feeling a little homesick and it was exactly what I needed. We'll be back often."}
{"text":"I drove all the way from Gilbert queen creek check out the hype... happy to say its all its said to be. Will come back for more"}
{"text":"I lived in Detroit for many years. I haven't had a coney in years!  This place was well worth the trip to Tempe.  It tasted just like I remembered as a kid living in the Dee.  They close at 7:30 and we got there at 7:14. They let us eat in despite the fact that they were about to close. The place was clean,  people were courteous and nice. I will come back!"}
{"text":"moving to tempe just to live closer to this joint. loved the food! top notch burgers and coneys. get the red faygo"}
{"text":"Moved to Downtown Phoenix from the metro Detroit area and am beyond grateful to have this little piece of home here. The food is amazing, they have Fay-go and Better-made chips and plus the Tempe location has Superman Ice cream! It even looks like a coney grill on the inside. Just wish the downtown location would stay open until 5 or 6, 3 is really early! Love this place, Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious Greek chicken salad.  Chrissy cashier, Dustin cook, and Danielle manager are all very courteous and helpful."}
{"text":"We had the Coney combo, the gyro pita, and the double burger, plus a Rock and Rye Faygo.  The grilled onions on the burger are highly recommended. Everything was super delicious, and that's after going in with high expectations.  Not only that, but the food is relatively reasonably priced. We ended up spending under $30 for four people."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation plus awesome yelp reviews, and we didn't regret it. Good food done right, with a friendly and passionate staff made for a great experience. This is what a burger stand should be. We'll be back. For sure."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a causal bite to eat. I always get a Hani chicken strip pita and a Greek salad with Vernor's ginger ale. I'm from Michigan so I love all the Detroit memorabilia but I bring plenty of locals who love it just for the food. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I'm a huge supporter of great non chain establishments.  I got a chili coney dog fries and as folks in the Midwest call it pop. The coney and fries weren't terrible, they just weren't great. I saw that this place had 5 stars and was expecting more flavor. I'm an Arizona native so maybe I have different taste then Detroit cuisine."}
{"text":"Thank God for the Detroit Coney Grill! David, the owner, is super friendly and is on top of his business. I ordered 2 Coney dogs with mustard, fresh cut onions, and topped with a sweet chili, that was a nice bean less meat sauce. The hot dogs were hot, expertly grilled, not steamed! The buns were warm, fresh and steamed. The Detroit dogs were excellent! When you bite into them, they have a nice snap.   I also had a bag of Detroit Better Made potato chips and 1 bottle of Faygo root beer pop. I do hope David can open a spot up north. I give it an  A+. I will come back again! Best of luck to David, the owner. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"OMG I was really ready to like this place because I love chili dogs but no way! Had the Detroit Coney chili dog and first of all the bun was cold. Second of all the hot dog had the Natural Casing which I really do like but this casing was thick and resisting my eating the hot dog so I had to spit a lot of it out. The chili was sort of tasteless and didn't really add much flavor at all. If you want a great chili dog go to Tommy's or Pink's in LA...Very disappointing and won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Place is pretty dingy.  8 bucks is way too much for a hotdog and a coke!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this restaurant. I was greeted when I came in and told that I would get 10% off since I work close to the restaurant. I was able to get a substantial lunch for under 7 dollars. The staff were courteous and pleasant. Got my to-go order very quickly and it was delicious. I will be back..."}
{"text":"Being from Michigan we Love, Love, Love this place! The food is fantastic! We don't get to come here often because it's out of our way but every time we do we enjoy it! We are hoping another location opens closer to us! Highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my parents came here while they were in town. Got the coney dog and a burger. Overall great taste even though its just a hot dog and burger I liked it.  Kinda hot inside because the grill is in the same room as everyone sits but we were only there for 20 minutes. I would come here again if I was in the mood for a chili dog."}
{"text":"Love!  Detroit Coney dog is awesome.  Both the Cajun and red hot fries are the bomb!  Staff is awesome!  Get there early as the line is long."}
{"text":"Was on business for a week and wanted to try out the best that Tempe had to offer.  I asked a few locals and Detroit Coney Grill was on the top of everyones list.  Stopped in Saturday evening.  Place was a small hole in the wall and was very clean.  All the employees were awesome and very talkative with us.  I ordered a Triple cheese burger with the works and 2 coney dogs with the works.  The hot dog was perfect.  The Burger.  WOW, hands down, the best burger ive had in a very long time.   Reminded me of a burger you would get when you are tailgating with your buddies.  Everything is done with generous portions of cheese, meat, and grilled onions.   The fries were thick and not overdone.   This place is a 10/10 .   Need to open a location in San Diego.  Carlsbad before any other city!!!!"}
{"text":"I am going to preface this by saying that I would be a cheese fry connoisseur if such a thing existed. I take it that seriously. That being said, Detroit Coney Grill has the most succulent, cheesy, and delicious cheese fries I have ever consumed in my life. I dream about them regularly. They shook me to my core. Their burgers are certainly something to shake a stick at. Would recommend to anyone and will consider having them cater my wedding!"}
{"text":"I love this place of coarse it remind me of home I hardly ever get to have a coney dog an since they are in the valley I been loving it ! They have better made chip vernors  and Faygo pops! I'm so excited I'm trying the double burger first time here for the burger! I can definitely recommend the coney dog and coney fries!"}
{"text":"Traditional Detroit fare, this place has the hot dogs that you're craving. Topped with chili and cheese and chopped white onions, it's exactly the same stuff that I've gotten from the coney shops in the Detroit area.  Trust me that one hot dog and one order of chili cheese fries is more than enough for one person. The fries are hand cut and fried almost to order. The dogs are topped and ready in moments.  Of course, you also have to get a Faygo to drink with it. Faygo is a Detroit soda brand. I enjoyed my Faygo Vanilla Creme that tasted a lot like Dr. Brown's Cream Soda.  Service was friendly. The place is clean. And it's an inexpensive meal. I got a laugh out of the Ohio State doormat at the counter where you're encouraged to wipe your feet."}
{"text":"Real deal best Detroit coneys you'll find outside of the D - so good you'll think you're in the D.  2 up and a Faygo root beer! A little taste of home!  Now in their 2nd location in the valley - doing it right David!  Nice simple diner atmosphere and great hospitality.  There's a reason they're high on this list:  http://mouthbysouthwest.com/2015/01/26/little-miss-bbq-detroit-coney-grill-among-yelps-top-100-places-to-eat-in-u-s-for-2015/  - Doug from Glendale"}
{"text":"Real, \"michigan style\" coney dog!  From the chili to the vienna style weeny.  Havent tried anything else on their menu, however i dont really see a need to.    Suckin on chili dawgs Outside the DCG....!"}
{"text":"This is becoming quite the staple downtown. ive eaten here on multiple occasions. what i like about ths place is thats there's no BS. just straight up good greasy food. no fake stuff or highly processed food. everything is cooked to order. the service is always welcoming. food comes out quick! everything about this place is great from the prices, through the food all the way to the service. it's a bit dingy and could use some touch up to make the place look a bit more fresh.   highlights: -soda mixing machine -fast service -simple food -burger & hot dogs"}
{"text":"We used to live in the Detroit area for over 35 years before moving here and were just at the Detroit Coney Grill;  it was truly a taste from home, in Detroit!  The staff is very friendly.  The food is authentically Detroit!  The coney chili sauce is really good as are the crunchy seasoned french fries!  And the salad...I had the chicken Greek...is very generous and flavorful with the made to order grilled chicken and yummy Greek dressing.  We don't get to that part of Phoenix often, but when we do, make it a point to stop here.  We also took all of our kids when they came for a visit and they, too, loved it!"}
{"text":"As a displaced Michigander, flying in from San Jose, Detroit Coney Grill was a perfect piece of home, away from home. Coneys were ON POINT! Service was friendly and fantastic, and for the kindness of the owner alone I would return. The fact that the Coney Dogs and Chili fries were spot on drives home that this place is excellent.   The SAP center may be the shark tank, but it could totally use a Coney. Coneys and hockey go hand in hand.   Thanks Detroit Coney Grill!"}
{"text":"I had the Double Burger w/cheese and a Detroit Coney.  The double burger had two patties that when combined were smaller than a one patty from McDonalds. Definitely not like the pictures on their website.  There was nothing special about the Detroit Coney, the chili was blah and the hot dot was small.  Not sure I will go again."}
{"text":"This is probably the only good thing about Detroit.  No wonder these owners moved to Arizona.  Detroit bashing aside--this place is top notch.  You can even get beets with your burger.  I know it sounds wild, but it tastes more amazing than it sounds."}
{"text":"The Detroit Coney Grill was a great place to grab a cheap lunch.    I had a hot dog with ketchup and an order of fries, and my mom ate a coney dog with onion rings.   We both thought our dogs were well cooked and flavorful.  Fries and rings were hand cut and very tasty.  We dipped them in ranch and both suspect the ranch was housemade -- it was amazing!  My mom did think the chili was a little heavy on the cumin, and I thought my bun was a little hard.  But it was cheap, yummy, and fun -- I'd definitely come back again if I lived in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Helped by Danielle and Claudia. Danielle was so patient as it was our first time here and very helpful! We will be back for her customer service alone. And Claudia made us excellent burgers! The gyro burger and double burger. Both excellent!"}
{"text":"The dog crunches when you bite into it, the chili is perfect (not too sloppy not too thick), minced onions and if you ask for cheese it's the sauce not the shredded stuff. Yummm! Looking for a way to fit in another visit before we leave in a couple or days."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic and authentic!  My husband grew up in the D and we love the real deal.  The food was delicious and fresh - we had it delivered via Uber eats and it was still hot and fresh.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for this a long time! Coney fixes on Christmas Eve whilst visiting family doesn't  always fit into the plans. The food is just like coney back home. Location and decor is great too. The owner is super friendly and excited to share a Detroit fave with Phoenix! Must try =)"}
{"text":"Decent little hot dog burger spot in downtown Phoenix. They grind their own beef every morning. Nothing spectacular but tasty."}
{"text":"They have a decent burger. Nothing special in my opinion.  They are only 2 ounce patties so you have to get a double or a triple to even make it worthwhile. 50-50 if I would go back."}
{"text":"I had my favorite Hani. Tasted just like from MI! Loved it! Hubby had the loose burger, we shared Better Made potato chips and RC pop. So good, it made me homesick. The owner and cashier were so friendly. Now, if they just had something Sanders for dessert.... Can't wait to get one of these in the West Valley, preferably in Surprise. There are Michiganders all over here!"}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing. The slices are thin so order more. The prices are very reasonable. The Coney Dogs are good but the burgers are better. Very friendly staff. I will definitely be back. Thanks for the food."}
{"text":"My daugher and her boyfriend brought home a menu and I HAD to go and try the loose burger. IT WAS THE BEST. Also stole a taste of my daughter's coney dog, which was excellent. And I would drive all the way across Tempe for the fries! Great atmosphere, great people. I admit to loving the opportunity to wipe my feet on Ohio State."}
{"text":"Reminds me of being back in Detroit with the family! Great food and great service! The dogs are a lil different than in Michigan but the chili is good and the Greek salad was perfect! It didn't come with beets but you can ask for em and they'll provide them. They have Vernors and all kinds of Faygo and Rock N Rye is my favorite!  If you're from Detroit this is a must visit and if you're not from Detroit, then give it a try and if for whatever unforeseen reason you don't like it, at least enjoy some Detroit Love!"}
{"text":"Family vacation in AZ and discovered this gem. If you want to have a coney dog just like being in Detroit, this IS the place! Staff & owner are great! We loved it! Come to San Diego and spread the coney dog love to the West Coast."}
{"text":"YELP once again didn't not disappoint!!! In town for the SF Giants series and found this place. The food was amazing and fresh!!! The services was even better. David needs to open one up in So-Cal, specifically the Inland Empire !!!  Vamos Gigantes!!!"}
{"text":"I moved to Arizona about two years ago from Michigan and every time I would visit home I had to go to a Coney Island to get my fix... Now it's not as necessary since we finally have one here!!! And let me tell you, it's the real deal. We met the owner our first visit; he's an awesome guy from Michigan with a real love for what he does. He imports the coney dogs straight from Detroit, along with Faygo & Better Made chips!  I got the Hani, which I usually get in Michigan, and it tasted exactly the same!!!! I can't tell you how happy I was! I've been to restaurants who try to mock the Hani or imitate it slightly... It's always a let down. But the Hani at Detroit Coney Grill: LEGIT!! I overheard the guy at the table next to me (also a fellow Michigander) say how awesome the coney dogs are too. How could they not be, though? They're straight from the D!!! I plan on trying everything on the menu and I plan on being extremely satisfied with it all as well. ;) The atmosphere is fun & filled with Detroit pride. It's also very clean! There were tons of Michigan people there too, which is always fun to talk to fellow Michiganders with that Midwest, humble mentality. The service was great - everyone who works there is super nice!! Quick too! The owner was chatting with us for a while when we were there which was really nice. You can tell he just wants to see his customers happy. It's nice to finally have a little piece of Michigan here in Arizona! I can't wait to come back!!! I'm bringing all my friends too, to show them Michigan knows what's up when it comes to good food! :)"}
{"text":"I am an over the road freight expediter from Toledo, Ohio and I end up eatin Detroit Style Coneys with a friend!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Had the combo and chili fries. I would have rather have had shredded cheese on the chili."}
{"text":"What can I say about Detroit Coney Grill in downtown Phoenix?  Fantastic food cooked fresh with amazing customer service.   Hours are Monday through Friday 10:30 AM until 3 PM  Chrissy Danielle and Dustin are super nice as well as Dave the owner!   I highly recommend coming here eating a triple and a Coney dog.   Two thumbs up and five stars"}
{"text":"Come to the Detroit grill off of Broadway in Tempe if you want a Coney dog or an amazing burger. I drive here all the way from Awahtukee during rush hour just to get a taste of their fantastic food. The owner Dave is incredibly nice and will treat you like royalty. Their food is cooked fresh and is absolutely delicious not to mention it is reasonably priced. Can't get enough of the Detroit love in here.  Don't forget to spit on the Ohio State doormat when you come in...The owner encourages it!   Go Tigers!!"}
{"text":"Best coneys in Arizona hands down! Way to represent the D!! Also give their burgers a try...you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have mints handy if you want onions!  Fast food done right.  No wait at counter.  Ordered Monday special: two coneys with fries and drink.  Coneys with mustard and onions.  Fries are fresh cut and fried.  Hotdog are grilled, and have nice crisp snap.  What's to complain?"}
{"text":"Reminds me of home. I love this place. Go get a real faygo! Their Coney dogs are on point. And I ordered clothes from them.  I miss Detroit and this place filled the void."}
{"text":"AWESOME......No other Coney place will come close to Detroit Coney Grill....Everyone can say they are like Lafayette or American but they are no where close. This place tops them all. The only thing I would change is the location......Bring it North David!!!  We will see you soon....cannot wait to cater my first \"coney party\" with Faygo and  all.  Good Luck and we know you will be successful!"}
{"text":"The guy cooking in the back was rude, and the girl working the counter told us they were closing soon so she needed to clean up and we couldn't hang around talking for too long. We told her we had no intention of enjoying ourselves there we would eat and leave. We were ultra embarrassed in front of our guests, needless to say we will never be back to this place."}
{"text":"A good review to balance the not-so-good one's I tend to feel more compelled to spend the time writing when necessary. This place ROCKS! The food is delicious--especially if you're remembering your Detroit childhood, and the service is always friendly. I can't help stopping in here for a coney anytime I'm down their way. Stop in and enjoy. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been working downtown for ages and finally gave this place a try and the long line made me hopeful  and they did not disappoint.  I went with a coney special of 2 dogs, fries and a drink for 9.99 which is above my lunch budget but after my first bite I knew it was worth it. The staff is super nice and welcoming which is really Detroit of them and you get a little pin to mark a map if you are from the area.  Great food, quick service and awesome staff will bring me back for sure!"}
{"text":"We loved when this place opened in Tempe. We would come often. About a year ago we got relocated to Dallas and have been missing The Detroit Coney Grill. We stopped in today when we landed from Dallas. Great service, phenomenal food. We would love to see a location open in the Dallas/Fort Worth area! Maybe a location in the PHX airport would be awesome too!"}
{"text":"This place is SO friendly. They care about their customers and the food is BOMB. Good service, good food. 10/10"}
{"text":"Follow Scott A.'s advice: Get the one-of-each, extra chili.  This will be a knife and fork sort of lunch, so keep that in mind. Or be sure to grab plenty of napkins. Either way, the coney dog was fantastic and the loose meat sandwich was awesome (though slightly salty, but still good). I also ordered the fries which were the perfect accompaniment for the chili topped delights. Because that chili is magical, I tell you! I licked the box clean.  As others have mentioned, they have Faygo \"pop\" there, and even Michigan boxed water. There is also a map in the back wall where you can use a push pin to show where in Detroit you're from. Sadly, I grew up in Ohio so won't be adding my claim to fame."}
{"text":"This place is doing everything right that a business should. The food is phenomenal (my wife got a green chile burger w/ reg fries, while I got a plain cheeseburger w/ 8 patties with Cajun fried), the wait isn't long, employees are passionate and proud of the service and food provided. It's apparent that this store is doing very well. I am from Virginia originally, I ended up in Laveen, AZ after I left the Army in 2015. Definitely the best experience I've had as a customer in Phoenix. If it's your first time going, the cashier will literally give you a brief history on the company and what is recommended. I was impressed that the cashier had only worked there a month and was able to handle that situation very well."}
{"text":"Best thing to come out of Detroit since Robocop.  This new fast-casual burger and dog joint looks like it might as well be a seasoned chain, but it's a new concept in a formerly failing strip. This and the neighboring restaurant, Hummus Xpress, have resurrected this location from the dead.   The food here is fantastic. Everything seems fresh and high quality. Even though the prices are fast-food low, you're definitely getting a lot of bang for your buck. The owner is pretty nice and has a lot of experience running local restaurants. He's usually there and he is very proud (as he should be) of his place and happy to tell you all about what you're eating and how they grind their own meat for the burger patties. That's always a good sign for me - an owner and staff who give a shit about their restaurant.   I ate a double cheeseburger with bacon and avocado and paired it with some curly fries. It was one of the best burgers I've had in the Valley. If you're a big fan of In and Out Burger or Five Guys, you should really give this place a try because it's not only better, it blows those places away. You can get your burger topped with just about whatever you want, and after you order you can watch them disassemble a whole potato and toss it in some hot oil for you.   Don't be intimidated or discouraged if you see a long line out the door at lunchtime because it moves really fast, and the register is up near the door so that's gonna happen. Rumor has it that they might start offering delivery soon after lunch. Makes me wish I lived a little closer. With the kind of detail and thought that went into this concept, they might have plans to open more locations eventually - looking forward to that."}
{"text":"First the quality of the dog was pretty good...probably one of the best I've come across recently.  The chili was ok...not great, not bad.  Like many places that cook fresh cut fries they're just a tad underdone.  There's a right way to do it (pre cook and then a final cook) and the not right way...this place like most others opt for the not right way.  Ordered the fries as chili cheese fries.  The cheese was that cheese like substance that you get at the movies...not good.  Overall good, but improvements are in order.  With all of the above I'd still go back, albeit no fries.  UPDATE 12/5/13 -- I've been told that there are different cheese selections for the chili cheese fries other that the liquid type (shredded and sliced).  That information makes a big difference (in my mind) in the quality of chili cheese fries.  That piece of information warrants an upgrade from a 3 star to a 4 star (they were on the border before, but help doesn't go in half point increments)."}
{"text":"I had The Dustin which was created by a customer. I was looking to save money but wanted try chili dogs and chili burger. The Dustin delivered. Chili cheese burger with 2 split dogs and 2 different cheeses. Can't remember if burger had 2 patties or not. I just know it was good and filling. Tried eating with hands but knife and fork are required."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, stopped here while I was in the area was a little skeptical but boy was I wrong very good flavor... I am a very picky and plain eater and they have a very simple menu and can whip up almost anything for you, amazing customer service Dave is the best I can already tell.   Live in Mesa let's get a location out here!"}
{"text":"Please come to SAN DIEGO!   A nice road trip over the weekend to Phoeniz , and stopped in Tempe, and I find this hidden gem. The owner was working and took our order..super nice , very \"DETROIT\" kind of guy and you'll know he is there when you see him. He was wearing a DETROIT shirt after all.   Read the ABOUT US section on their website..I LOVE IT! I think there is a typo though, which makes me at ease that it's not a robot typing it...towards the end of it it says \"How are we going that ? \" when its supposed to say (I think) ..How are we DOING that. Otherwise, I loved reading it!   Ordered the Detroit Coney & the Triple Cheeseburger   Detroit Coney & Fries- Holy cow , delicious. Comes with steamed bun, hot dog, onions , mustard and chili. Looks really simple...but its sooooooo good. Definitely one of the best tasting hot dogs I've had. Mind you, its not huge and it doesn't have a million toppings but it's just SOOOOOO good. The chili is what makes this dog, and so is the dog itself! Nice snap to the dog. The fries were fresh, and hand cut. You can really tell it is hand cut. Nice portions too.   Also had the pleasure of tasting the TRIPLE BURGER...mind you it starts with a double...then goes to triple..quad....quint and then some specialties. You need to get the triple if you are looking to fill you up. The Quad is equivalent to a double. The reason is simple...the burgers are freshly grinded ..THEY GRIND THEIR OWN BEEF! The patties are small , and its just the way they do things. Pricing is very reasonable and it's one of the best damn burger's I've ever had. Really simple but just so tasty!   The owner came up to us during our meal and asked how everything was and even shared some business plans. I am hoping they expand to WEST, because they will kill it there. Currently, there is no place like this in San Diego so I am hoping to see one soon.   Thank you for a great meal and great hospitality!"}
{"text":"I am from Florida.   I say that because they asked to include your location in your Yelp review.   What an outstanding hamburger! I got The Quad, which I recommend very highly. All burgers were excellent, and the options refer to the number of patties. I.e., quad = 4 patties.   There's a reason why this is one of the top ten burgers in the USA. There's also a reason the fries aren't top ten. They were ok."}
{"text":"What is a \"Coney Dog?\", you ask.  \"Definitely not a chili dog\" is what has been told to me.  A real Michigan Coney Dog has an all-beef casing hot dog grilled to perfection and placed in a steamed bun.  This hot dog is topped with, and this is where it gets the distinction from a chili dog, an all meat chili, onions and mustard.    Since I LOVE to try the most I can in one order... I ordered a \"Combo Coney Dog\".  This is the Coney dog I described above (I got my onions grilled) with \"Loose\" meat on top of the hot dog.  What's \"loose meat\"?  Well, that's just grilled ground beef crumbled up...  They put the loose meat on top of the hot dog and then put the all meat chili on top of that.  Just dang delicious.  I really liked the taste of the hot dog itself.   Not to be out done by the hot dog, the fries here are fantastic.  I litterally watched the chef cut the potato and put the curly fries in the fryer.  The fries are just that fresh.  Oh, by the way, they grind their own meat daily for their hamburgers.  I stopped in Coney Grill to have a Faygo pop and to try the hot dog.  I grew up drinking Faygo pops when I was a kid.  Grape being my favorite flavor.  Detroit Coney Grill has Faygo pops in the bottle.  There is something about the taste of a soda out of a bottle that makes it taste 1000 times better.  I savored every cold, sweet sip.  I like this place.  I'm going back.  I'm taking some of my ex-Detroit family when they come in town.  Yummy.  This place is great!  Get there early, they close a little bit early."}
{"text":"I checked this out given all the positive reviews, but sorry to say I cannot recommend this place as anything special. While I have not had Coney dogs in Detroit, I grew up on Coney Island hot dogs in Kalamazoo, MI and this place doesn't hold a candle to Kalamazoo's dogs. Hot dogs have a tough skin, chili tastes like it is out of a can and too soupy, onions are not the sweet variety. Mustard, fries and soda pop are as you would expect."}
{"text":"Showed up during an off time. Only one other couple in restaurant.   I ordered the 2 cony  combo special with upgrade to chili cheese fries. I will admit the dogs were pretty good, chili was solid as well. But the star of the show is the fries. I usually do NOT like fresh cut fries, but these are AWESOME.  Suck on that IN-AND-OUT.   The meal was a bit on the pricy side.. $10 for 2 dogs and fries with a almost $3 up charge for chili and cheese. I guess they have to charge extra to make up for the 50 napkins that are needed LOL.  I am looking forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"The dog and fries were good, but I was disappointed. The food did not stand up to the hype in my opinion.  Granted, I am not from Michigan, in fact I've never even been to Michigan, so whatever nostalgia or hometown comparison is lost on me. That said, I do enjoy good food, though, and the food was good, no complaints, but it just didn't seem all that special to me. I can get good dogs and burgers at other places too, so apart from the focus on Detroit, or Michigan in general, there really isn't much about this place to draw me, as a non-Detroiter, back again. That doesn't mean I won't go back, it just means that it probably won't make my short list of must-go-to places."}
