{"text":"Good comfort food...especially the pork belly, the ribs and the beans. The ribs are not too sweet and really tender. Try the cocktails, the bourbon lemonade is so good! Awesome service!"}
{"text":"Was excited to have ribs American style and they did not disappoint the food was amazing!!!!         
I was siting at the bar area watching tv and should have asked for a table the service at the bar was so bad this girl sucked and was so unbelievable asked for some sauce and never got it all she did is walk by and smile more like a  scary smile and worst of it all when it came time to pay she started to coach me how to tip told me that people here tip 25% what a joke !!!
Won t come back so sad cuz the food was so good"}
{"text":"It's a very good place to get proper BBQ food in MTL. The brisket was slightly underwhelming in flavour. But the ribs were so good! Definitely one of the best I've ever had. Their sides and appetizers are quite good too. Especially the onion blossom and the poutine. It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Please dont believe the other ratings. I havent figured out why it is currently rated so high, but it seems like maybe because there arent other American BBQ places competing with it. I went with 3 friends, we all had different meals and they were all awful. Being from America, id like to think we have a grasp on good BBQ and this place lacks that in every way. The service was just ok. The chicken was dry, the mac and cheese was noodle with cheese melted on top, the sweet potato fries tasted fake, and the taco were poorer quality than Taco Bell. We strongly recommenf doing your stomachs a favor and steering VERY clear. 8 thumbs down for 4 dumb Americans."}
{"text":"I was a fan when this place originally opened and was thrilled to see it return after a 3 1/2 year absence due to flooding and the ensuing insurance battle. We went in the early evening on a Friday and it was pretty quiet, so given that and the fact that they just re-opened a few days prior, I think it would be unfair to judge the ambience.

The service is extremely friendly and definitely something I hope continues beyond their first few weeks back in business. To start, we were given complimentary pieces of pork belly, which was a very welcome surprise. For appetizers, we had the brisket spring rolls and the jalapeño poppers, both of which were excellent. My main course was the smoked prime rib sandwich with BBQ baked beans and mac 'n cheese. Maybe a tad on the pricey side at $19, but the sandwich was excellent and far less saltier than it could've been. I'd definitely have it again. The beans were very good, but the mac 'n cheese was a bit disappointing as I found the texture to be rather grainy. Our meal ended with a complimentary key lime cheesecake, which was excellent and a nice gesture due to a few menu items not being available.

The menu in general looked great with a tremendous variety of burgers, sandwiches, chicken, pork, beef, fish, etc. You can find just about every staple of southern American BBQ on this menu. The draft beer selection was alright, but I would like to see more local beers available instead of the usual Molson, Rickard's, etc.

Being on a pedestrian street like Prince Arthur, the location is excellent for a terrasse and I hope that's in the plans (I should've asked), but I plan on returning either way."}
{"text":"Went here during my bachelor party.  Great food and a fun spot.  Owner is awesome.  Big out with us for a few hours gave us the run down of the city!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken is amazing here! Worth the drive to Montreal for some great chicken and barbecue smoked meats."}
{"text":"i was craving some southern comfort food and found this place on yelp. We ordered & picked up to enjoy at home. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of mac & cheese. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of spicy fries, he was a little disappointed that the fries didn't come with a dipping sauce so we had to resort to ketchup which sucked.We both shared the fried onion. i'd re order the chicken & waffles. and he would definitely re order the pulled pork. we both agreed that the fried onions weren't really worth the 10$ and was much smaller than the picture on the menu so we vowed to try something different to nibble on and share apart from our meal the next time we order , maybe the jalapeño poppers. The chicken & waffles hit the spot and the size was perfecto.We will definitely eat from there again ."}
{"text":"The mains were decent enough, but the fries were soggy and you only get the tiniest cup of Mac and cheese for a $3 upgrade.  Service was comically bad."}
{"text":"Rubs,
I am not one to be extremely difficult, however I was accompanied by a very simple eater. We both left unsatisfied by you. We ordered the following:
Appetizers - Smoked mac and cheese, Jalapeno peppers, Fried battered wings
Main -Brisket sandwich with coleslaw and spicy fries, Deep fried ribs and a side of poutine
Drinks- Pitcher Rubs lemonade (I think) and 2 shots

Our waiter Phil was a gem. Our appetizers came relatively fast, I am not going to lie everything looked so delish, but once I took a bite of a wing it was just completely tasteless. It was fried to perfection,but sadly  bland .  The mac and cheese cheesy top was yummy, but the more I ate, it lacked of that special taste I expected. I mean I've had, and tasted way better than this. I didn't make a big fuss because maybe it was just a question of personal taste. The Jalapeno peppers were okay, since they were wrapped in bacon then fried in batter, the bacon was a bit undercooked. I only ate 1 as I couldn't stand the sweet after taste that came after. I asked our waiter to put the rest in a take away box.

The main took more than 50 minutes to come, totally ridiculous. We waited so long that we were not too eager to eat. Yes the waiter came and apologized by saying that they had many big groups. I understood but it was a long wait. We arrived around 8PM and our main arrived at 10:20ish NOT OKAY.People that were seating next to us ordered after and received their meals why did we have to wait?????

Our mains were way better, the brisket sandwich was sooooo good. The spicy fries were not spicy at all, but had great potential. Overall for me my main course was a winner. As for my company he loved his meal too, everything was to his liking. We were both full so most of our mains were brought home.
As for the lemonade it was okay, not a big fan , but since it was not all about me I had to choose something we could both enjoy! To me it was not worth 30$ 
Our bill was over 124$ (rough estimation) 

Verdict - My appetizers were not the greatest, but the mains were delish. The wait time tarnished my experience. They could have at least offered something for the inconvenience.  Yes I would go again, I do want to try other items and give them another chance."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was extremely subpar. Once seated in the empty restaurant we asked the waitress if we could move to a spot with less AC (the entire restaurant was FREEZING), she said, \"No that a big party was expected but she wasn't even sure if they were coming.\" Our food came quickly, I asked for hot sauce, the waitress said they only had buffalo sauce but when I asked again she did say they had Tabasco but they don't usually bring it to the table (the Tabasco arrived in the usual table size bottle). After the food was done, it was too cold in the restaurant to finish my beer so we waited for the bill so long we had to go to the counter at which point the waitress snapped, \"I'll be there in a sec!\" Would not return or recommend."}
{"text":"Un excellent restaurant pour les amoureux de la viande et du BBQ! Gros coup de coeur pour le porc aromatisé avec de la coriandre et pour les fèves aux lards absolument divines! Les drinks sont excellents. Celui aux pêches est sucré mais sans tomber sur coeur, léger et rafraichissant et le Bloody Ceasar épicé avec goût, j'ai particulièrement aimé l'assaisonnement BBQ plutôt que le traditionnel sel de céleri! Les serveurs sont souriants et sympathiques, le chef un vrai passionné et talentueux! Ce type de restaurant sportif n'est pas mon genre habituellement mais la nourriture y est tellement excellente que je compte bien y retourner!"}
{"text":"We got a reservation at Rubs the night of the Mayweather-MacGregor fight. We were seated right at the bar and had two TV's to in our view to watch the fight. The manager and his staff were great, accommodating and very friendly. The food was great, I ordered the full rack of beef ribs that looked like something from the Flintstones but tasted phenomenal.

I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of the BBQ in this restaurant considering it is in Canada. The cooks at Rubs know what they are doing. The bartenders were great and made a great Rubs Tea. We look forward to returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty solid bbq place. We had trouble figuring out the parking situation so we parked on the street few blocks away (don't think the lot next to the restaurant is permitted parking). We got a shared ribs and brisket plate. Came out pretty fast and the flavors were great. Drinks were pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"This place is unreal. Maybe make the fries a little crispier theyre a little soggy when we get takeout. But nonetheless straight fuego."}
{"text":"I got the Sunday special, the ex-cel-lent ribs !!!!! The fries were also fantastic. Will come again."}
{"text":"Finally made it out to this Rubs. Been to the one in Laval, and while I'm no BBQ expert, I've had enough BBQ in the states to know that this place is legit. They've got all the usual suspects when it comes to these places: Cole slaw, fried chicken, pulled pork sandwiches, corn on the cob, etc. We started with the Southwest Salad, which was huge and fluffy and probably needed more apples and almonds, but provided enough roughage to set the stage for the main event: the St Louis Ribs. We split the full rack with French fries and Cole slaw (which I kinda wished there was more of). The meat was fall off the bone sticky goodness, just what you'd expect from the pits in the middle of Missouri. At first glance, one might think that we didn't order enough food, but the ribs had me stuffed and damn near delirious. It was a pretty mellow Tuesday evening, which was more our speed (I've walked by when it's been packed with rowdy sports fans). The servers and host were very attentive and nice, and while I did have a serious case of food coma (aka \"itis\") afterwards, overall our experience was solid. Will probably come back with a few more friends."}
{"text":"Service here is fantastic, staff was very attentive from the moment we walked in.

Food is even better, we ordered a plate for two and added a beef rib.  Portions are huge, definitely not for the smaller of appetites.

Brisket, large portion, melted like butter in your mouth, not dry at all, would recommend having it in a sandwich.

St. Louis ribs, sweet, sticky, smoke flavour throughout. Nothing extra needed, they stand up on their own.

Pulled pork, moist, flavourful, yummy.

Beef rib, wow, best in show, highly recommended, why are you still reading this? Order one already....  They're big, huge even.... You're still reading.... Order this, you need it."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic,  always worth the trip to rubs. I gotta say, just tried out their fried chicken tonight for the first time and it was, most probably, the best fried chicken I've ever had. It just gets expensive, even though we share a meal for two people. 
Great place if you're in the mood for BBQ food.  The beef rib is delicious with a side of mac and cheese. Food is so good and offers a little something for everyone. Sweet pulled pork, spicy and smoky brisket that is always served with the bark and smoke ring, and that deep fried chicken...oh my."}
{"text":"Nous y retournerons. Très bon service de la part du staff. La serveuse nous a très bien conseillé pour la sélection des plats et elle a préparé notre place en fonctions de notre fille (1 an). Nos verres d'eau étaient toujours remplis. Le gérant est venu nous voir pour nous parler de la place, il était super accueillant et serviable. Le menu est assez varié et offre de la bonne viande fumée. Les drinks un peu dispendieux mais succulents. Satisfait de notre première visite. 

Un bonus à notre arrivée : repas enfant gratuit les mercredis. Yahou !"}
{"text":"Visiting montreal for the past 4 days and walked past this place quiet a few times. We always noticed that it was empty. Our last night here we decided to go in. And I'm glad we did. So delicious! We had the pork belly rolls, fried pickles which were kool-aid pickles (never had that before), Mac and cheese appetizer, and a side of brisket. Everything was fantastic! Service was great and the food was great! I really hope this place does well. Great patio too!"}
{"text":"Good barbecue. Had the Texas platter which allowed us to sample everything and was very good.

Tried the koolaid fried pickles, they were interesting and were a source of debate. However you sort of expect that when ordering them."}
{"text":"Had my birthday there yesterday , booked by phone and they were very accommodating to our big group including one child that required a high chair, I arrive 15 mins before the time I booked and our table was ready in a very nice spot 
The host was amazing and patient with us that some people were late because of traffic and he made sure we are okay with drinks till we ordered.

Food took a bit long but it's understandable with such food and such big group (12 people) but everything was amazing , I recommend the onion blossom if you are a group , we had 3 on the table and everyone enjoyed it 

Meat was tender and the spices were delicious

This place is definitely a place I'll go again"}
{"text":"Had the special full rack ribs with two sides, an order of poutine and the key lime pie.  Hubby and I shared; it was plenty of food.  Food was good and reasonably priced.  Will be back again..."}
{"text":"Walking up to this restaurant, I started to have regrets thinking \"Oh boy, this looks like just another chain franchise.\" Yeah, maybe it is, but I was pleasantly surprised by everything this restaurant offered! My wife and I love good BBQ, we've sampled some great southern BBQ on our travels in South Carolina and Louisiana so when we find a great place that measures up we don't look anywhere else (generally). Rubs lives up to that standard. Right away the host and service was attentive and helpful with choices. I was a bit disappointed to find out they did not have any brisket sandwich so I ordered the BBQ chicken. It was fantastic in every way. The BBQ mac and cheese is delicious as a side. I also got a bit of Makers Mark on the rocks to accompany the meal which worked perfectly. Prices are a bit high but well worth for portions and quality here. Don't let the chain styles of this place turn you away, it's superb BBQ food!"}
{"text":"Cheat day ? C'est le bon resto pour toi ! Les mouilleurs ribs en ville c'est sur et le poulet frit est juste incroyablement croustillant ! Mon entre préféré c'est la jalapeños poppers mais les ailes fumée avec l sauce fromage bleus sont incroyables aussi ! On peut aussi changer les à côtés dans notre assiettes comme frites de patates douces ou Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken I have tasted inNorth America. Better than Popeyes and other southern fried chicken. They serve a huge portion size too so I left there feeling bloated in a good way. Astrid, the lady who served us was exceptional. If you are ever in Montreal, find your way to RUBS and try the food"}
{"text":"We arrived here late after a long travel day in from Germany.  The Stanley Cup was on and we could choose to sit in or outside.  We chose inside so we could watch the game (Go Caps!).  We had great service from beginning to end, with a warm welcome, quick table service, and steady attention to our drinks and needs.  The pulled pork sandwich was terrific.  The fries and other sides were OK.  A good choice of draught beer, and a lively hockey crowd.  Will return next time we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"If you want to elevate your triglycerides, then this is the place to be!  I had the mac& cheese burger that was delicious.   Plate came with fries and coleslaw.    The mac & cheese substitutes for the bread.   Only suggestion is that salt & pepper.   Otherwise, the smoked burger and homemade fries are the best!"}
{"text":"I am southern and this is awesome southern BBQ. If I say the portions are adequate that would be an understatement they are huge. I had the pulled pork sandwich on my first visit and it was awesome, tender pulled pork, perfect amount of sauce served on a ciabatta roll. I like the non mayo Coleslaw and the fries were good. Service was exceptional. My second experience was delivered and I got fried chicken with mac and cheese and Coleslaw everything was wonderful tasting. Well 3rd time was very disappointing, ordered take out 2 rib and pulled pork dinners and smoked Jalapeños app. order arrived with burned app and burned fries, no bbq sauce for the ribs and sauce from the beans or something spilled in the bottom of the bag rendering the napkins and utensils useless. paid 74 cad that cost them 2 stars"}
{"text":"Not authentic BBQ at all! Rubbery and cold fries, Mac and cheese was flavorless and should be named Mac and milk."}
{"text":"Great dinner last night! The brisket was perfect.."}
{"text":"Walked around looking for a good barbecue dinner and stumbled across this place and it turned out to be this place. I decided upon their barbecue salmon and it was fantastic! Highly recommend stopping by for a meal if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, courteous and homie restaurant. Great for families or someone that wants to watch a game while being social. Lol food is excellent and fresh."}
{"text":"La place pour manger des côtes levées fumées comme au Texas ! Excellente viande fumée ! Le service était bien et les prix excellents pour la qualité du repas."}
{"text":"Incredible location. Food was insanely good. Ribs and chicken melted off the bone; sides were awesome. Apps were unbelievable. Try the Kool-aid fried pickles. 

Great beers. Great staff. Attentive and knowledgeable. Owner checked in on us and was very personable. I have a high standard for BBQ and this place left nothing to be desired. In a happening location. Lots of people watching."}
{"text":"First time at Rubs on Sunday night (Superbowl!)
Luckily, We had a reservation at 6:30.
We ordered a ghost pepper ceasar and a bourbon bacon. Both were great and under $10.
We ordered the mac&cheese appetizer, which has 5 different kinds of cheese but was a little to starchy. 
We decided to order the special #poutineweek poutine with 14 hour smoked and braised brisket, fried onions, bbq sauce and avocado & cilantro mayo. Was not disappointed.
Our food arrived very quickly even if the place was FULL. 
Waitress was sweet but obviously very busy. 
I will clearly go again to try their ribs."}
{"text":"We chose this place based upon Yelp reviews and it was GREAT!! The smoked beef rib plate we shared. which included spicy fries and smoked beans, was absolutely OUTSTANDING!!! Service was top notch. Atmosphere is pleasant but nothing special. We went on a Saturday night at 6 PM and there was no loud music and conversation was easy. As we left, my wife commented: \"That was some of the best barbeque I've ever had in my entire life!\""}
{"text":"Le propriétaire a fait de longues recherches pour concocter d'authentiques recettes de BBQ américain. Il sera plus qu'heureux de vous raconter l'histoire de ses pérégrinations pour trouver les recettes idéales des produits BBQ slow cook.  

Endroit à éviter si vous êtes végétarien ou si vous surveillez votre cholestérol. 

Idéal pour prendre un verre et manger avant un spectacle au Café Campus tout à côté."}
{"text":"Food is quality for sure, and the vibe is super friendly! The two George's who own this place are hilarious guys, big personalities, big loud laughs, and smart business people who have worked super hard to turn their hobby and passion for barbeque into a life for them and their families. 

As someone who doesn't eat meat anymore, I sometimes avoid this place because the memories of the brisket, the huge ribs, the delicious sauce, the generous and delicious mountains of food cuts me right me to my green little heart and nearly breaks my resolve. When I do go, it's because I'm in the area early when it's quiet, I can dig into a crazy delicious spicy ghost pepper Ceasar and have a chat in a classic cozy brick bar ambiance away from the hustle on St Laurent and Prince Arthur. 

If you are in the area and hungry and wonder if you will be well taken care of here, the answer is yes, every little thing is gonna be alright."}
{"text":"Poutine Week!! Thank you RUBS for participating :) I ordered only the special Poutine and was not disappointed!  The combo of coriander lime sauce with the smoked meat balanced things out from getting too heavy. The presentation was great. And the smoke meat blended in well with the fries and gravy   Their Mac n cheese hits the spot if you've got a craving for cheesy goodness with a nicely broiled top layer. The Southwest Salad, Alabama was generous but quite tangy. The vinegar was very sour especially at the bottom which generated quite a pucker  of course, no one really goes to RUBS to eat salad so they're excused for not acing the veggies.  One of us ordered the RUBS combo brisket and it's enough meat for another meal. Brisket is tender enough but really dark in some places.  We went during a very cold weekday lunch so the place was quiet but normally it's much louder, especially on game nights :)"}
{"text":"Perfect meaty day with great customer service (specially a waitress named Catherine)!  

Catherine (I hope I got her name correctly) was super upbeat and friendly. Took time to explain to us about the food while being super quick and efficiency and non-sales-ish. Simply love her energy and attitude!  Wish all the waitress in the world are like her! 

Food was fantastic too! We tried the Taxes Platter for 2. Just perfect! Pulled pork was delicious! Ribs are right on. I did notice beef brisket was just \"ok\" in comparison, but still good. And the baked beans are surprisingly delightful! Who knew?! 

Definitely will go back when I am in the mood to treat myself with a hearty meaty meal!"}
{"text":"Nouvelle place, super bonne bouffe, une belle découverte grâce à Yelp! 
Des cocktails détonants, des ribs succulents, du personnel agréable et un chef cuisinier au petits soins pour ses convives: Une bonne adresse sans contredis. On lui souhaite longue vie sur cette belle avenue!"}
{"text":"Great Southern-American-style food and amazing service! The prime rib burger is one of my favourites and do not hesitate to order the pulled pork rolls! All delicious!"}
{"text":"a 1st time for us.

Went for dinner with my family on Sunday night 6:00 pm. They have a special on Babyback ribs, $10 discount on a full rack, really good deal.

Ordered the blooming onion as an appetizer. Tasty but very, very greasy. I know, I know it's deep fried but the grease pool at the bottom of our plates was a bit much.

My wife had the Pulled chicken sandwich - she loved it.

We had the ribs with fries and beans......I have to say they were some of the best ribs we have ever eaten. The meat was spectacular, smokey and tender and not too much sauce. Well cooked, grilled and fresh and wow delicious. The fries and beans were also top, top notch.

The only reason I'm giving the 3 star rating is because the music was WAY TOO LOUD. Ridiculous. It's Sunday night dinner and not Friday night at 11:00 and the music was thumping .... boom, boom, boom. A total turn off. I love music..... not when it's blasting top 40 at nightclub levels. Is this a restaurant or a night club? We were sitting in the side dining room, ground floor and the bar area was even worse - huge speakers blaring away.

I politely asked them to turn the music lower and only got the palms up shoulder shrug.

The food is a 5 star, the noisy ambiance not so much."}
{"text":"15$ for an enormous rack of ribs?! Whaaaat? This is the place to go if you're craving ribs (special is every Sunday). My partner ordered the burger week special which was tasty. The staff was very friendly and service was quick. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I love me a great blooming onion. Add a ginormous frosty mug of beer, and that makes for a perfect Friday 5a7 in my book. The service here is friendly and reasonably fast. The ambiance is typical bbq joint but more on the pub/steakhouse style. Good for a group get together or a fun meal for 2. But back to the blooming onion... It was cooked perfectly. The batter was light and the inside was soft and sweet. The dipping sauce was great. They also keep their beer mugs in the freezer so your beer stays cold until the last sip. Definitely a great way to end a long work week and kick off the weekend!"}
{"text":"The fried onion is the bomb at RUBS. It is something that we always order overtime we come here. Highly recommended for a games night or regular night out. The ribs and fried chicken are great as well, leaving our bellies incredibly full each time :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for their Mac&Cheese Week Special - donuts stuffed with mac & cheese and pulled pork. The donuts were definitely worth the detour. The main dishes however were slightly disappointing. I took the chicken & waffles plate which was too oversized, too greasy & too dry for my taste. My partner took ribs & chicken. He did enjoy the ribs."}
{"text":"I've made many mistakes in my life and walking into this place is one of them.

Mac and Cheese: My friend and I both ordered a side of mac and cheese and we literally got macaroni \"AND\" cheese. Look at the picture. The cheese was not incorporated with the macaroni at all. Just because you put a cheese blanket on macaroni doesn't make it mac and cheese! Some parts were not even melted. You can see the grated chunk.

Texas brisket: It took forever to get this good looking brisket with fries and coleslaw. BUT, it just looks better than it tastes. This meat is dry. I don't care how many hours they claimed to have braised. It lacks the succulent and juicy texture that I was expecting from BBQ. When the meat is this boring, at least you need to put out good sauces to cover up. There was only one available which tasted like soy sauce. Having been to other BBQ joints, I was expecting other kinds of sauces like BBQ sauce, spicy, bourbon, etc. By the time I finished the meat, I felt so gross. It's the kind of feeling you get when you eat too much greasy food. I am not even sure what was in the coleslaw, but it was definitely not cabbage.

Service: -100 stars. We almost wasted 2 hours at this place, not because we enjoyed staying here so much, but because it took forever to get the food. Our appetizer mac and cheese didn't come out until after 20 minutes of waiting. The main food didn't come out for another good 30 minutes. To get the bill, we waited another good 20 minutes. To get the credit card machine, we waited forever again. Not a single person came by to check on us over the course of the meal. If a weekday dinner service is like this, I can't even imagine what it's like during weekends."}
{"text":"Not only was the food great and the service excellent, but the owner and staff went out of their way to accommodate my last-minute large group. I run an academic program in Montreal and had booked a dinner/pub quiz night for orientation at another venue nearby. That place had a power outage which sent me scrambling to find an alternate restaurant with 30 minutes to spare before my students arrived. Thanks to Rubs, the event was a smashing success. And my poutine was deadly decadent!"}
{"text":"Wow, ça rigole pas chez RUBS !

J'ai testé un combo (apparemment nouveau) avec 2 morceaux de poulet frit & 1/3 de côte levée Saint-Louis plus deux accompagnements au choix (le tout pour $23) et c'était un régal !

Les ribs sont pleines de saveurs et la viande est fumée et tendre à souhait. Quant au poulet frit, il est bon mais pas exceptionnel non plus. Les accompagnements sont assez variés, j'ai pour ma part goûté au mac & cheese fumé (supplément $3) qui était bon mais pas assez \"cheesy\" à mon goût et aux frites épicées qui sont assaisonnées de paprika et de piment (oui, ça fait beaucoup de gras & de carbs - je sais).

Inutile de préciser que les portions sont très très copieuses, et même avec un gros appétit, je pense qu'il est techniquement (quasi) impossible de terminer son assiette (merci les doggy bags). 

En entrée, nous avons aussi partagé les piments jalapeño fumés au bacon et farcis au fromage ($6) qui étaient pas mal du tout ! Et j'ai également pu goûter à la tarte à la lime en dessert, qui est très crémeuse et qui permet de finir son repas par une touche de fraîcheur bien appréciée (je tiens néanmoins à préciser que ce n'est pas vraiment une \"tarte\" car ils la servent dans un bocal en verre).

Bref, RUBS c'est vraiment un endroit sympa pour une soirée entre amis. La viande est de qualité et on y mange vraiment bien. Par contre, n'y allez pas si vous faites attention à votre ligne. Ce serait dommage de se priver !"}
{"text":"It's the third time I have been to Rubs. Last time, my husband and I grabbed a quick dinner, a pulled pork sandwich. This time we had onion blossom as appetizer, a half rack (pork) + pulled pork combo and half rack of beef rib.

Food: the onion blossom is a must try. I never tried it before. My local friends neither, they all thought it was fries by seeing the photo. My American friends know this dish very well and told me it is very common in southern BBQ restaurants.  This dish is enough for 3 people to share. The beef rib is amazing, very tender inside and with beef jerky like outside. The pork rib is a little bit dry but also tasty. You can taste the smoker flavor in the dish.

Price wise: this place a sandwich with a side is around 15$. Half beef rib is 25$ (35$ for a full rack). Price may be considered a little bit higher than a regular BBQ restaurant, given the size of the dish. However, they advertise they don't have micro-wave or freezer in their kitchen to provide a fresh ingredient. If this is real, it may increase their cost for sure.  Also the design of menu and the decoration of the restaurant are very nice. The price of beer is very reasonable."}
{"text":"There were 7 of us. We have ribs, pulled pork, Memphis wings, and fried chicken. Everything was incredible. Of the sides, the beans and the Cole slaw were the bomb! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a long day of visiting different museums for museums Day. This place was right around the corner from where I was staying so I decided to give it a try. 

The food selection was good everything was smoked BBQ style which I like so I was excited. I decided to go with the chicken strips and I was glad I did. 

Chicken fingers were crispy and juicy. Excellent. My boyfriend got the Memphis wings with the spicy fries and smoked beans. The Memphis sauce on them give them a hint of BBQ. The wings aren't crispy which is what we are used to in NYC but they were good."}
{"text":"After sampling virtually everything on the menu, I sat and listened to Pit Master George school a group of lucky onlookers about ribs, rubs and why [secret number]ºF is the perfect cooking temperature for any meat you can get your hands on. 

You could tell by the way he spoke that this man knows BBQ, and the food backed up the claim. From the wings to the chicken, the ribs to the pork belly, everything they laid down in front of us was perfectly prepared. The sides were also some of the best I've ever had - Mac 'n Cheese, baked beans... these guys a legit. 

I could ramble forever about how awesome Rubs is, but do yourself a favour and just go try it yourself."}
{"text":"I came here for a Yelp Elite event ~1.5 yrs ago and sampled a lot of their food, which was all spectacular. I took my family to dinner and our original option was closed, so thankfully I remembered how amazing this place was and decided to bring them here!

The food is just spectacular. I had the baby back ribs and fried chicken platter, with sides of macaroni salad (solid) and baked beans (surprisingly great and tasty). The ribs alone were phenomenal and make the entire dish worth 5 stars, but the rest of the meal was also very good. Next time I'll be sticking with just the ribs, however, as I wasn't a huge fan of the fried chicken (a bit bland and didn't sit too well). Relative to the portions, everything was quite well priced; I normally eat a lot but I had to take home 1/3 of my meal cause I was too full!

The service was fast and polite, although the restaurant wasn't too busy since we got there early and it was quite cold outside. I imagine it could be different on a busier day, but for us the service was just fine.

The atmosphere is splendid! I love the decor and vibe of the restaurant, it's like a hybrid of homey and classy, and it's a really great place for a family dinner or a date. Location is also very accessible, and the music isn't too loud so you can still have a conversation.

Overall:
Food: 9/10 (ribs 10/10)
Service: 9/10
Atmosphere: 9.5/10
Portions: 9.5/10

I will definitely be keeping this place in mind as one of my favorite food places near my house!"}
{"text":"I have coworker back in New Orleans who really judged me for trying this place. In my defense, I saw it and had to try it. I wanted to know if Canada could make good BBQ. The menu had a sampling of different types of American BBQ. I was impressed. They even had the Alabama white sauce. That's difficult to find in some areas of the US. Let's start with what I drank. I had Rub's Bloody Caesar, spicy. I'll be honest. I had never heard of this drink before visiting Montreal. Read about it. You'll be surprised by the ingredients. Anyway, I love anything spicy. But, this drink was over the top spicy. I had trouble finishing it. I also ordered the Smoked Beef Ribs. They were awesome. It reminded me of Kansas City BBQ. All together, I was impressed. Canada can do BBQ."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for dinner and I must say one of the best service experiences I had in Montreal! The waiter was really attentive and fast. He suggested items on the menu when we asked him questions. The food was amazing! Everything was great! You have to try their smoked mac and cheese."}
{"text":"OK, this is easily the best American BBQ in Montreal now.
Came in after a whole week of rain and needed comfort food. After finding out their fried chicken is one of the best in the city, I made up my mind to come in and see if all the hype is real.

It is.

Seriously, after looking at the menu and the piles of food going by me to other customers, I was torn between ribs and fried chicken. Dimitri, my server offered that I could have both by ordering one plate and pay by the piece of the other. So that did it, I ordered BBQ beef ribs and a piece of the fried chicken. I should say that what I got was A RIB, not ribs, the thing was massive and the amount of meat on it rivaled any steak I've had. It reminded me of the kinds of ribs Fred and Barney would chow down on in the Flintstones cartoon. The meat was practically falling off the bone, the top was crusted and inside all the BBQ sauce had somehow been absorbed. I did not mind for a second throwing my tables manners out the window and looking like Conan the Barbarian, because it was that good. The fried chicken was also fantastic and I intend on ordering a full plate next time.
Fries, coleslaw and other sides were average. The Bloody Mary was great and Dimitri is a great server.
Because my rib was so big, I barely made a dent into it and they were more than happy to wrap it up and allow me to take it home which was cool.
I'm coming back with some more carnivore friends."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff!!!! The pork belly and chicken wings were really tasty and juicy!!!! Good ambiance in general.....ideal for groups!!! Will defenitely go back again!!!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a nice restaurant with a rustic ambiance to it. Classic bar with sports playing on TVs.

FOOD: Honestly, I've had better. The food wasn't bad, I just think I can find better elsewhere. I would definitely not recommend the Mac n Cheese... It was flavorless and was just not worth it. It felt like they took pasta has been left out and just attempted to melt cheese on it in a microwave. The ribs are good though, however, like I said, I can find better tasting ribs elsewhere.

PRICE: The prices are standard but what's nice is that they have specials for students. Even with the specials, I don't think I will be coming back.

SERVICE: The staff was ok, they did their jobs but it wasn't the best experience I've had."}
{"text":"You ready for a night of great fun? Don't forget to load up some great food before a night of heavy drinking. Better get to Rubs to get your bbq fix. Hands down best BBQ and food and service in town! Not only the food taste excellent and well proportion and best of all Everything was freshly made!.  Owner Steve is an awesome guy too. Not only he cooks great food even better he knows great service and so are the staff!  After the food came out he came out and check on us and make sure the food was ok. It was not only ok, it was delicious!!!  Highly recommend the BBQ and their Rubs mojito and Rubs tea! Even personally showed us where to go for the next adventure (I'm a big foodie in the US and had tons lots of BBQ around the states and I got it say. The BBQ there beat out some of the top BBQ joint in NYC and NJ. I will definitely return to this place my next visit!"}
{"text":"I thought the BBQ would be good but tbh, it's really bad.  I ordered the brisket with baked beans and smoked Mac and cheese. The brisket didn't have enough fat, wasn't that tender, and had almost no flavor. The baked beans are fine but the Mac and cheese was SUCH a letdown. They said it was smoked Mac and cheese so I was expecting an undertone of it or something but it wasn't even decent mac. The macaroni itself has absolutely no flavor and the only indication of cheese seems to be the part melted on top of it. I'm adding a star because my server was honestly such a sweetie but the main part is the food, which turned out to be such a disappointment. If people think this is good BBQ, I'm sorry but I have a news flash for you. You're missing out on real, authentic mouthwatering BBQ."}
{"text":"Viande cuite à la perfection ! On a vraiment eu l'impression de retrouver les saveurs du Sud américain ! Endroit convivial et idéal pour partager un bon moment entre amis"}
{"text":"great food . go hungry. the pulled pork is to die for. very friendly staff.  will be back again"}
{"text":"Delicioussssss mmmmmmmm je suis encore loin de devenir vegetarienne ... pardonnez moi, l'assiette mixte pour 4 personnes à 85$ est fantastique et la viande est tendre et savoureuse. Ambiance de bar, service tres bon."}
{"text":"I was one of the first to review when they originally opened a few years back,  but I am happy to say they are back with gusto. I have been here twice for their Sunday baby back ribs special and I cannot say enough good things about it.  The staff is warm and friendly, the meal came out super fast and it is a great place to spend a Sunday with friends. The outdoor searing is expected to be ready by next week which will only make things even better."}
{"text":"Fried chicken: Soggy (was delivery but I really don't live far). Not the flavorful party in my mouth like I was hoping.

Fries: Soggy/depressing.

Jalapeño poppers: Didn't remove seeds so the spicy kills any hopes of there being flavor. Not the most pleasant and I can handle my heat.

Gravy: Strange moldy taste (thought my tastebuds might have been off, but girlfriend confirmed it wasn't just me)

Coleslaw: Tastes like an armpit smells... Definitely something wrong there. Should come with a side of deodorant"}
