{"text":"I LOVE the Perk.  I love that it's off the main drag and a bit of a hidden gem usually only frequented by locals in the know. It's quaint, friendly and charming. Now, the caveat...you have to like children to appreciate this place (most times). There are usually many at-home moms and their kids here or, as Jimi notes, some breast-feeding action going on (I am one of them). This volume of kids means that there could sometimes be stroller traffic and a higher volume of little voices that some may appreciate. The food is surprisingly delicious. The Sunday brunch is quite gourmet with the eggs Florentine stealing my heart. Great quesadillas and grilled cheese too. Coffee is tasty as is the large selection of desserts all very reasonably priced. Their muffins and soups du jour are always great. The service is decent given it's usually 1 person out front and 1 prepping the food in back so it's not amazingly fast but respectable. My only beef is the fact that it's cash only which sometimes catches you off guard and give that it's in the middle of Riverdale and not on the Danforth, proximity to a bank machine is not good (Convenience store next door has an ATM...and is usually open). I am happy to live in a neighborhood with a unique and lovely little place like this :)"}
{"text":"Since I live in the neighborhood, I have been there several times. The environment was great, but the food is eh... Disappointing. I had hot chocolate. Good! Cookie. Average. The cupcakes and bars. I don't like it!!"}
{"text":"We had the Thai Rice bowl & the Buddha bowl and shared a soup (roasted cauliflower and tahini with pomegranates) OMG! The best little cafe hidden off the beat and path. What I find! I'm bringing everyone here! I hear they have a brunch on Sunday , next time"}
{"text":"The coffee is ok, a little on the weak side, and there are no refills. The muffins are consistently excellent so I will probably still come gere on the way to the withrow park farmers market"}
{"text":"I love love love their sandwiches...one of the best sandwiches in the city.  No matter what sandwich you choose, it's always goooooood.  My only problem is that their sandwiches are only available after 11am.  That seems sooo odd.  There's so many times when I would want their crack-addicted sandwiches but it was only 8-9am.  I hope they change their times to make those sandwiches available earlier."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my friends, and I was not satisfied. The service was terribly slow and my friends had gotten their lunch before mine came(we all ordered at the same time). The waiters did not give my order to the cook, therefore people who came later then me got their order before me. We were very time limited and having to wait 20 minutes for my lunch was not fun. I did not have a great time. I suggest if you are time limited, don't go here. The food was good, although the service was not."}
{"text":"In keeping with their Central Perk reference (the cafe in Friends), this place is reminiscent of that same iconic hangout.  Take away the urban feel, add soccer mom vibe, subtract squarefootage by half, and you have Riverdale Perk.  Setting is most ideal for people with stable lives who have happy families, work in the arts, and would like to do a little reading/writing while enjoying cafeine or a light bite."}
{"text":"I have been here for brunch, breakfast, and lunch several times & the food has always been delicious. Since I have always had such good experiences here (& at this point would consider myself somewhat of a regular), on my most recent visit in September, I decided to review.   Food: Homemade, vegetarian friendly, breakfast/brunch(Sundays)/lunch Personal favourites so far:  - Breakfast: PST (Proscuitto, Spinach, Tomato... and egg) sandwich - Brunch: caramalized banana french toast OR cornbread benedict (it's a tie) - Lunch: crunchy thai bowl (kale, wild rice, veg, peanut sauce) Coffee: they do everything but just drip is self serve and locally roasted - I love it Quick bites: she makes muffins/scones fresh each morning, and does breakfast bars (like a homemade granola bar) to take away fast Dessert: many treats (all homemade) - cakes, cookies, bars Service: fast, friendly, often the owner herself Wifi: Yes Patio: Yes Art: Always a local artist, changes periodically Parking: street parking free (after 7am)  Overall, this is a bit of a hidden gem. Nestled right in the middle of Riverdale homes (just south of Withrow park), it almost surprises you to see it's patio furniture, cute awning, and daily bustle when you come across it. I'd highly recommend for Sunday brunch, a quick pop-in in the morning, or a sit down lunch."}
{"text":"PLEASE DONT GO HERE. I used to love going to the Perk until I took a glance into their kitchen while going to the washroom. It was disgusting.  I also had their fish tacos, brought them home and the fish had totally gone bad I have also found hair in my food on multiple occasions.   Also, all of their baked goods are frozen every night after being out on display all day. This keeps happening until they sell everything. Trust me, nothing is fresh.   The staff is also very rude. The girls don't seem like they want to be there and don't care about their customers.   Save your money, don't take a risk eating here."}
{"text":"I am in love with this spot.  I would move to this neighbourhood just to be near this place.  I feel bad writing this review cause I don't want more people to know about it!  I want to keep it all to myself!  This was my first stop on the Easter (minus bunny) java jaunt.  The coffee I had was mighty tasty and all the pastries and treats looked delish.  Sarah L mentioned she had a roast beef wrap recently and was quite pleased.  I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe hidden in the middle of the beihgbourhood on small-ish streets. With such a nice patio. And I love the vintagy/rustic and quiet atmosphere.   They make killer fresh smoothies and lots of delicious pastries.   They also made iced hot chocolate on the spot (not on the menu) and it was delicious.   Special of the day was sangria lemonade also lovely.  Staff is super friendly and welcoming and I will definitely be coming down back again to enjoy the whole experience all over again."}
{"text":"I'll echo the sentiments that this cafe alone makes me want to move to this neighbourhood.  Tucked away in Riverdale, this place is a nice break from so many other coffee shops in Toronto that seem cut from the same cloth.  The crowd is diverse: families, 30 somethings on laptops, a few teenagers thrown into the mix.  The music is awesome, but light enough to function as background music.    This place has a really nice relaxed vibe, reminiscent of a smaller city.  I highly recommend it if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"A bite from our full experience review -  \"We stumbled upon this little neighbourhood spot on our exploratory bike tours. While the cafe is paying a bit of homage to Central Perk, there was not much of a parallel we could draw here. This fact did not diminish the sweetness of this local coffee shop.\" Full review via my profile!"}
{"text":"It's convenient for me to stop here and the espresso and desserts are quite nice. It's a bad stroke of luck that every time I stop by I somehow receive the slowest service and have to watch people who have come after me get their order first.   I enjoy sitting outdoors though. The inside is full of VERY loud locals."}
{"text":"Checked out Riverdale Perk as part of the East End Coffee Crawl Pt. II - their name says it all.  Very cute, quaint, and nestled in the heart of Riverdale, out of the way from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Riverdale Perk is that secret spot only the Riverdale locals know about.. until us Yelpers found out about it.. and wanted to spread the word about this charming spot ;)  By this time, I had my second Americano.. this time a single.. caffeine buzz was kicking in and I had to clean my palate... they serve Te Aro Big Bro espresso beans and boy was it tasty.  They servers were really nice, despite a flood of Yelpers visiting their establishment.  I had a great time here, despite the short visit."}
{"text":"Additional to Will L. I would like to say not only was the server very nice but when I was heading out the door I overheard a customer saying he didn't mind waiting behind the crowd of (Yelps) since the server was overwhelmed by us somewhat.    Nice & friendly neighbourhood so that's why I second the motion for Shari M. to move to the neighbourhood.  Although when Adeel O. went to the Logan/Riverdale corner Convenient Shop, the staff didn't know where the shop was but the customer KNEW!  I got a Latte to start my day and even though it took me until the next stop of the crawl to finish it, it was definitely good to the last drop.  It's like I didn't want to let it go.    I wanted a teaspoon and there was two containers of metal teaspoons with faded labels of \"clean\" or dirty\" on the other, I THINK!  Anyways, I figure it's 50/50 probability of getting a dirty spoon and if I was awake I could probably see which were actually dirty.  BTW, I would like to thank Adeel O. (THE planner) for getting me to Riverdale Perk, nice guy.  Also Kat F. for the overflowing schwags.  Susan C. I did get ONE passionfruit chapstick!"}
{"text":"I have IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and the owner was unwilling to create something from her \"very small\" kitchen that would allow me to eat without going into spasms of pain.  I mean how hard could it be to mix in your rice with a few veggies ready to go?  I find the service of the kitchen incongruous with putting the customer first.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Have not eaten here but the coffee is great, the people serving are genuinely nice and friendly and the atmosphere of the cafe is warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Not the best coffee, sub par desserts, sub par service, sub par rating.  Actually the coffee might be below par, as it is weaker than Tim Hortons.    A neighbourhood disappointment.   Too bad because it is near the park and would be a great place to stop by.  Alas, the offerings are not very good."}
{"text":"the perk is that its cuddled within main streets and a hop skip from withrow park.  this place was very relaxed when i passed by before five pm on a friday, with a couple of ladies sitting on their white couch, one of them breastfeeding (hey you notice these things - boobs are boobs man.)  i wanted to sit down and get a cappuccino right away but had no time and so after a little photo session with my battery-eating hunk-a-junk i call a camera and the perks inner sanctum i called it quits and came back a few hours later when it was not only still chill, but romantic.  this place gets 6 stars for ambiance - there were chandeliers tuned with the lights held low and candles flickering as gaelen, the barista silently played as i walked inside.  it was just me and him and it was a great opportunity to afford me time to get to know the place and the kind of folks that run it.  well, gaelen was clearly an interested and intelligent guy and a breeze to shoot the breeze with.  he gave me a little background about the history of the place (originally owned by another, reclaimed by the current owner to great effect).  i ordered a double shot cappuccino that arrived in the same size takeout cup that would feature a latte.  as per gaelen the size of cup is not what matters but what you put in to it.  in other words, there are different combinations of foam, milk and espresso that go into a cappuccino versus a latte.  so this place has its own take.  the coffee was fine, nothing too rich, but enjoyable.  what floored me, in addition to their soothing locale was one of their desserts...or late lunches?...which happened to be in the form of a blueberry coffee cake.  it was like a mini loaf of bread filled with a little coffee, blueberry and love.  it was made there and was worth the 3 bucks i spent on it.  in terms of price, this place is not cheap.  the cappuccino was about 4 bucks which is expensive considering i can get an organic one on queen for 3 and a quarter.  though this place feels like a place id prefer relaxing in.  so its an ever bobbing scale as all coffee shops are.  its good to know that its close by, near a wonderful park and also a place for a seemingly good and relatively inexpensive lunch and brunch, one day soon to be devoured."}
{"text":"I have to gone to the  R  perk many times since my last review.  It  always has  something new and delicious on the menu .  Great atmosphere,    cozy and friendly.  And now with warm  good weather coming!  Outside options with tables in sun or shade . No  ' Hurry up leave please , \"  --or a rushed out feeling here!  \" Stay, enjoy yourself ,\" have a snack or meal ; something yummy home made,   and relax , ! Perfect."}
{"text":"Met a friend this afternoon for coffee and lunch at this neighbourhood cafe. Neither one of us completely sure how this place came on our radar.  Regardless, this cozy cafe has lots of drink and menu options. For hot drinks (on this snowy, winter, frigid day) they offer a vast array of tea and 3 types of coffee. For the coffee, 2 different sizes and there are no refills. The tea came in a mug larger than the large coffee. Nonetheless, it wasn't my favourite coffee but the tea was delicious!  For food: I had the beet and Parmesan salad. Lots of fresh ingredients which blended well with the mild dressing.  So many gluten-free and vegetarian options. Many baked goods that looked mouthwatering.  Good spot for studying or catching up with a friend. Staff don't rush you out.  Price point was very reasonable for the large portion sizes."}
{"text":"Top notch coffee, nice and comfortable seating, an outdoor space for enjoying the weather, good foods and friendly service. Well done all around."}
{"text":"The Perk has been my neighbourhood spot for years. They offer delicious, seasonal homemade yummies (soups, sandwiches, cupcakes, cookies, salads, etc) and delicious coffee from Te Aro.  Great to kick back and relax in with a friend, or throw open the laptop to do some work. There's usually a rush of moms around lunchtime, which usually means noisy babies and kids, but they don't often linger long.  Great patio for the warm months, and always cozy and snug inside when it gets cold. Would definitely recommend the Perk (and not just because I've come to love the owner!) :)"}
{"text":"VIBE  Not to be confused with Central Perk from famed hit show, Friends (whaa whaa), this Perk does feel like it could be transplanted from a TV show if it were set in Brooklyn. But the Riverdale nabe is lucky to call it their own.   Service isn't exactly urgent but it's laid back. Clientele is the type that like to get to know their neighbours. Nice little patio in the summer. A great place to catch up on your favourite book.   I ATE  The last time I was here I had a sandwich and salad. It was hearty, healthy and delicious. Plus, I can tap away at the lap top and look at pretty art work on the wall for an afternoon. Chairs aren't exactly made for sitting there all afternoon but if you're in the middle of a leafy, green neighbourhood with not much proximity to much else (especially if you're car-less) then you make do. Coffee and tea selections aren't anything to sing home about. That said, it seems that they have a nice selection of sweets.    OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  So perky. As cliche as it sounds, it truly is a gem. I hope it stays around for a while."}
{"text":"Riverdale Perk is a great morning stop for coffee and a bite. Don't let the sea of strollers scare you away - there are usually a few seats outside you can escape to that are tranquil and serene.  The lattes are deep and frothy, and the bagels are lightly toasted with just the right amount of cream cheese.  The staff is also extremely friendly and courteous. If you ask for water, they'll bring you a carafe w/ cranberries floating on top. It doesn't get much classier than that!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Riverdale Perk Cafe for a quick bite after sipping on some lattes at Rooster Coffee down the street.  Great neighbourhood - if you sit at their outdoor seating area and you like dogs, then you're in for a treat. On a nice and sunny day there is an endless stream of cute puppies you can feast your eyes on  Friendly service - the girls here are sweet and professional  Food - minus one star because my roasted veggie salad bowl had WAY too much fennel seeds!! Every bite was like a brutal assault, being punched repeatedly in the taste buds by fennel seeds is something no one wants :( way too overpowering. I was able eat a good portion by biting with the perfect amount of pressure - enough to cut though the kale, but not enough to burst the seeds. This required way too much effort for a relaxing Saturday brunch so I needless to say, I won't be ordering this again. The other salad we got was very yummy!  Cute little place, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Still a really cute cafe, but the coffees and lattes are much too weak. Despite its proximity to where I was staying during my Toronto sojourn, I found myself skipping this place for other cafes for a caffeine buzz."}
{"text":"What's a Allonge?  The staff at cash looked at me and said I don't know, let me go ask someone It is an Americano with extra hot water..   Hmm, I guess I am not going to order that and crossing my fingers hoping she is not the one that making my cappuccino.  I do love the friendly and laid back vibe of Riverdale Perk Cafe. The patio is amazing overlooking a quiet neighbourhood street. There are also different seating option inside and of course I like to chill out on the coach.  Their cupcakes are all made in house and looks just delicious, I will try that next time.  Te Aro beans used in all their espresso drinks.. which is always my favourite!"}
{"text":"My partner stumbled upon Riverdale Perk Cafe, a little neighbourhood cafe near the park. The cafe has a vintage upscale ambiance. Like the store, the owner, Danielle is kind and charming. Everything is baked in house.  We came for brunch but unfortunately missed it by 2 minutes due to the line in front of us. Instead, we opted for lunch. We ordered the Kale Caesar salad, herbivore burger and matcha latte. While the matcha latte was not to our liking, the Kale Caesar and burger were right up our alley.   I really enjoyed the Spicy Kale Caesar ($12.5) topped with crispy chickpea, garlic chips, parmesan fricos, homemade croutons and smoked coconut \"bacon\" with sriracha and creamy caesar dressing. The various ingredients in the dish created a very unique textural experience.   My partner devoured the herbivore burger ($12) within seconds.  The pattie consists of organic quinoa. bulgur wheat, lentils, almonds, beets and carrots. The burger is completed with cucumber, tomato, avocado mash, swiss cheese, alfalfa sprouts and cilantro lime aioli. He raved about the aioli.  Overall, we both really enjoyed our venture to Riverdale Perk Cafe. We will definitely be back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: This is clearly a neighbourhood joint. You can tell it's the local hangout on Saturday morning which gives it a great friendly and homey vibe!  Food and drink: The coffee was good and the brunch menu was very reasonably priced with good portion size. I loved that they could make almost everything on their menu vegetarian. However, the kitchen is small so don't expect to be able to deviate far from the menu (I asked for scrambled rather than fried eggs, and they weren't able to accommodate). I ended up getting the french toast which was delicious!"}
