{"text":"Reading these reviews, I am wondering if we went to the same restaurant? We have eaten here several times and always leave full and happy. My hubby loves the Cavatelli and a special they have now and then, Mushroom Ravioli. I always get the Penne pasta with their Bolognese sauce. Their Bolognese sauce is the best! It is flavorful and unique - you must try it. Try the Bolognese and you will never say this restaurant is bland. And, our service has always been great! To me, Corso's is a west side treasure."}
{"text":"Corso's has THE BEST spaghetti bolognese I have found in Cleveland.  I went there recently to have the Fish Fry on a Friday night.  I would not reorder this again...fish was dry and the french fries were cold.  The dinner was $60 (for two and tip).  The next time I will stick with the bolognese."}
{"text":"We went to Corso's to try the fish fry - we love this season and all the local fish fries.  Every year we try a couple of new fish fries.  After reading other reviews, we didn't get our hopes up.  Well - we were pretty pleased.  The restaurant was busy at 6:45 on a Friday night, we were greeted immediately and seated.  The waitress, Carole, came to the table to take drink orders.  The glasses of wine and glasses of ice water came promptly, along with bread and herb butter.  We both ordered the fish fry, with cole slaw or house salad and baked potato / French fries.  The Lake Erie perch was hot and delicious, with a seasoned breading (not a tempura breading).  The salad and cole slaw were fresh, the French fries were not house cut but were hot and cooked appropriately.  Carole was attentive but not intrusive.  There were 3 other waitresses, I think, all of them hustling.  We will go back to try some of the Italian items (Carole described their several distinct sauces - tomato, marinara, mushroom, meatball...), as well as take some friends to another Friday fish fry.   This isn't a fancy place, but the staff was friendly and professional and our food was good."}
{"text":"went here for dinner with spouse.  my husband arrived 10 minutes prior to me.  the waitress never asked him about a beverage.  i arrived and had been seated for over 20 minutes.  no waitress came over to check on us.  2 other couples came in after me was seated and had their beverages with salads.  i gave the waitresses a reasonable amount of doubt seeing that there were only 2 in the building.  we waited another 10 minutes and finally left.  we were totally ignored.  this restaurant is a good candidate for a makeover show on the food network!   my husband and i eat out at least 4 times a week also!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner.  Place need a bit updating.  Service was kinda slow, I think they had 2 server servicing the whole place and there were more than 10 tables occupied.  The bread wasn't fresh and was cold.  We had the pizza, flounder, pork chops, spaghetti there and it was \"Meh\" at best, very bland and not a lot of flavoring.  For the price and experience, you are MUCH better off going to Nino's in Ridgeville or Stella Mia in Westlake if you don't want to go to a chain."}
{"text":"This is our families favorite place to meet for family get togethers.  Three generations  meet once a month.  My parents and uncle  love the veal paprika it is always perfect.  My sister  and aunt love the Weiner schnitzel  with spatzls.  The Hungarian dishes  on the menu are great.  I love the lasagna and  have tried all pasta dishes and they are all great.   There soup are all great if you like cream of mushroom soup there's is the best ever I could have  it every day if I could  , the wedding soup is also excellent .  The service is always great , the waitress have all worked  there for years are friendly   and efficient.  The also very good with children and have a kid friendly menu.  I have never had the desert because  I never hafevroom.  Next time though will give something a try. .   If there was a 6 star option I would give it,"}
{"text":"The three stars were given solely on behalf of my husband's lasagne. This was our first time here. It was chosen as a last minute, we are starving and can go no further place. I ordered the $21 Prime Rib special with salad and one side. My husband, the aforementioned lasagne. We each had bread and a salad which were fine. Nothing special. He enjoyed his lasagne which was delicious. My prime rib was unfortunately not very good. The slice was large but very thin. It was completely unseasoned and tough. I ordered it medium rare. It came a little more done than that, so ok. In my honest and fair opinion it was not worth it. I am glad we tried it. The crowd is a bit on the older side. At 52 years old we were the youngest diners there. The place needs a serious update and cleaning. The staff were a little slow."}
{"text":"The food and service is always amazing  Very generous with portions.  I always leave with food to take home.  Corso's is my fav Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is a great lunch stop for us and the service is spot on.  Good food and always fresh. It might not be true Italian but it is well priced and you always leave with a smile."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here on our very first date (three years ago) and we recently returned for our anniversary. He has a lot of family history here, and some of the staff from his childhood, when his mother worked there, are still around.   If you're looking for a nice, quiet American-Italian dinner spot, this would be a spot. The crowd is older, but I far from mind it.  I, myself, am a picky eater, and most of what I eat is \"boring\" to the common man -- but I really enjoy their food! Their servings are HUGE. I have yet to eat an entire dish. I know we'll return again (even if it's in three more years!)"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the pasta is fantastic. The bolagesse sauce is outstanding!!! Would of gave 4 stars but was never informed about the extra charge for substitute sauce and pasta. $6 for cavatelli and  $3 for sauce. Way over the top :-("}
{"text":"My girl told me about this Italian restaurant Corso's and suggested that we have dinner there. After our less than good experience with Matt Classless @ Olive Garden N. Olmsted where we were attacked by a Paul Blart looking guy their GM. for just having an Ecig on my table while getting ready to leave. After we both had a very stressful work week and might I say that I was a bit grumpy. we arrived and were immediately greeted and seated. We started off with a Long Island Iced Tea suggested by our Bartender/Waitress and as described the drink and the bubbly personality from our Waitress seemed to instantly melt the weeks stress away. The waitress suggested the sausage stuffed pepper appetizer. I could have made a meal of those alone. It gets better, we started seeing the wonderful plates born in their kitchen. Plates were piled high with Pasta, and salads that were put on the plates with much care.  By the time our meal was finished the restaurant was clearing out for the evening and this is where the charm of the place became more apparent. As the waitresses cleared tables from what seemed to be many satisfied customers we had the chance to interact with the girls. This is a smaller restaurant but had ample wait staff. They were all very friendly and we all had laughs together. In summary I'd like to say that this will be a regular stop for us as the drinks, appetizers, food, atmosphere and staff were all wonderful. WE WILL BE BACK!  Thank You Corso's  P.S Maybe you could have your First Class wait staff teach Matt Classless how to run an Italian restaurant.   BRAVO Girls!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here with friends. Food was good and for three of us the bill was just over $30. I was quite suprised there was only one other couple in the place. The portions were a good size for the price."}
{"text":"I was hoping to find a diamond in the rough, and instead was stuck in the rough.  I found the food to be blah, the service atrocious, and the restaurant a former fast food joint."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Great fresh LAKE PERCH!!! found this place just driving bye and stopped for the perch.  Loved the food, staff was friendly.  The booths needed more support, but overlooked it because the dinner was delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were a little worried when we walked in because the setup is strange and the place is so small. It turns out this is one of those hidden gems of northeast Ohio. The food was amazing! And the prices are not too bad. Definitely don't judge a book by its cover with this place"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very accommodating with my requests.  We have lived in area for several years and just went.  Great dinner and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the quality of food and service.  Veal paprikash ($17.95) was greasy and tasteless - did the cook forget the sour cream?  Pasta came out in enormous globs on the plates & Weiner Schnitzel was dry.  I asked our harried waitress 3 times for water; the 4th was a charm!   I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is our Monday or Tuesday go to place. They have the best Bolognese in the whole world. If you go on a Monday or Tuesday pasta is only $8.99. You can't beat that. The portion size is so....huge. I have never been able to finish it. I always have enough left over for lunch the next day. The Bolognese is creamy, rich and very tasty. It is a blush sauce and has lots of meat in it. You have a choice of the type of pasta you want the Bolognese over.   The never-ending bread is crusty on the outside and soft in the middle, just like it a good Italian bread should be. They serve a wonderful garlic butter that melts in you mouth. It is a great compliment to the Bolognese. You can really soak up some sauce with it if you want.  (I think that is more of a man thing to do.) You also get soup or salad included with the meal. The salad is a nice size and you can get crumbled blue cheese on top. All this for $8.99. WOW!  My husband also gets their Eggplant Parmigiana. Again, the portion size is large. He loves it and says it is one of the few places that doesn't serve soggy eggplant. They make it like mom makes it. The Eggplant Parmigiana is not part of the Monday/Tuesday special.   The wait staff is very friendly and helpful, but since we go there all the time they know us. We also go early in the evening so we always get seated right away. The have a full bar with some good house wine. The décor is plain but clean.   I would highly recommend this place for hardy Italian food. Nothing fancy, just good family type Italian food at an affordable price (on Monday or Tuesday.)"}
{"text":"This is your very generic Americanized Italian restaurant that are all over Northeast Ohio.   Corso's is for the person who isn't adventurous in their eating, thus my parents and Grandpa invited me to join them last Sunday.  Food wise, don't expect anything more fancy than veal Parmesan or seafood alfredo. The menu is American-Italian, with traditional dishes like Spaghetti and meatballs, manicotti (which I ordered, 3 large ones, they were ok), etc. There's also weinerschnitzel for some reason too. Figuring the house salad would just be iceberg, cucumbers, and tomatoes (I was proved correct). I opted for minestrone soup as an appetizer. The soup was relatively flavorless and vegetables weren't cooked all the way.   The atmosphere is more upscale than Peppers for example, and is one step above the red and white tablecloths. The walls are freshly painted with minimal knick-knacks, Italian operas crooning in the background. There's a small wine list. Christmas Lights above the bar.    The place was dead on a late Sunday afternoon. There literally was only 1 server who was very nice although upsold like no other (I hate that). She gave us a carafe of diet coke, my parents were happy with that. Faced with a party of 10 arriving, our server disappeared during our meal.   4 people with entrees, soup or salad, and sodas totaled $72 before tip.   I'm biased, this type of place isn't very high on my preference list but the parents enjoyed it. I'm waffling between 2 and 3 stars.  Corso's are dime a dozen, especially on the west-side suburbs. If you're looking for a traditional Italian-American restaurant on a budget, Corso's fits, but so do other places."}
{"text":"The ONLY authentic Italian restaurant on the west side of Cleveland. My 108 year old Italian grandmother agrees."}
{"text":"Walked in and was hit first not by the warm welcome of staff...but of a smell that reminded me of my childhood.  Sadly it wasn't a pleasant memory...it was that of my grandmother's leaky wet basement.  Add to that, the less than cheerful \"hey\" my group was given and things were off to a bad start.  It only took being seated facing the bar to see several half empty caraffs of wine hastily covered with aluminum foil to realize we had made a mistake.  We thanked our server, explained we were going to leave, and left with the impression that this was A - not the first time someone had done an about face...and B - that she could care less.  Will not recommend, and will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Husband and I checked out Corso's after hearing numerous good things about it. Maybe we're spoiled by our Columbus favorite, Villa Nova, but this place just didn't do it for me. I wanted to like it, I wanted to like it so bad, but it was just \"meh.\" I mean, it wasn't bad, by any means, but it just wasn't a diamond in the rough. I read a review saying it smelled musty - I didn't notice that, it was fine. Lots of elders eating when we dined, must be a local-favorite.   Not a very good beer list [but who goes to Italian for the beer?] Other waitresses seemed very attentive...Our waitress was nice, albeit non-attentive and slow [we weren't rushing.] She recommended the fried mozzarella. She said they were homemade. They were pretty standard to me. They also serve bread, so the app was unnecessary. The bread is just pretty basic Italian bread, but it is served with a very good garlic butter to dip it in. That was delicious! I ordered chicken parmesan and the husband got spaghetti with meat sauce. They came with salads. Standard iceburg, good poppyseed dressing, not anything unusual. Entrees were also both standard, nothing to call home about, but still tasty. I would never salivate over this place, but if you want Italian you shouldn't rule it out. I liked the noodles, the spaghetti was thinner than when you buy it at the store, which I enjoy [I usually like angel hair.]  My nana has always raved about this place - specifically because they've kept the weiner shnitzel on the menu from the old owners or something like that. I can't attest to it, and I'm sure she hasn't had it in about 20 years, but she always says it's great.  Worth the visit to try something new, but don't expect the best thing you've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Came here on Wednesday for my mom's birthday.  We had a group of 8 people, the service was good, our waitress was very pleasant & helpful & we all agreed the food was very good.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Corso's. heard raves over the spaghetti. Bolognaise. It was excellent as were the stuffed peppers and fried mozzarella appetizers. Value-cannot be beat. Service-attentive and competent. And where else can you get a house Chiant for $4. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I think the restaurant itself needs to be updated, but I normally get take out so it doesn't affect me all that much.  However, this is the only place to get bolognese. I don't order it at any other restaurant as it doesn't come close to this great blush sauce with plenty of tasty meat.   Calling to order is a joy when Eric answers. He is always friendly and has something nice to say.   I have been a returning customer for many years and will continue to be."}
