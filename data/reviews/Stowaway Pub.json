{"text":"I've been to the Stowaway Pub more times than I can count. I went at least every Sunday to watch my football team, which will remain nameless to avoid retaliation :) The beer selection is adequate, but the liquor selection has anything you'd ever want. The bartenders are personable and friendly. They'll also order what you drink if they don't already carry it. I know this because they started carrying fireball after I requested it! The food is good too, but my favorites are their burgers, stowaway fries, and fish fry every Friday. Selling point for me and I'm sure everyone else is the low prices on food and drinks.

I recently moved to Washington D.C. and I miss the Stowaway Pub dearly. I just found a small neighborhood bar near my apartment so we'll see how it measures up."}
{"text":"A hidden gem.

What really stands out about The Stowaway is the actual venue. Small but not cramped, very spacious, comfortable booths, high-quality televisions viewable from anywhere. (There aren't \"too many\" TVs. The space-to-screen ratio is perfect). It's perfectly lit, and a very comfortable place to spend some time.

I've had several items from the menu, but the grilled cheese is a must. They offer a variety of cheeses and breads, and I have never had one so good. Not even my mother has made a grilled cheese that compares. Their fries are another highlight, and the fresh cut fries are the perfect crispy-greasy-flavorful combo.

The service is top-notch. Attentive, accurate, and friendly. The speed with which the food is delivered is frequently staggering, even when expecting it to be quick.

I do, however, find their beer selection lacking. Great Lakes, the typical domestics, Stella, and maybe two other microbrews. The beer is very fairly priced, however, so it's a minor quibble."}
{"text":"Love the Stowaway Pub!  Cheap beer (OK selection) and great good!  Friendly employees as well.  We come in here often and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely disgusting. The burger tasted like boiled meat and the barely existing bun was soaked in butter from the stowaway fries (which were not fully cooked). If wasn't for the cold beer and gift certificate we used...this would have been a complete bust."}
{"text":"The Stowaway fries are excellent. The bartender was friendly and entertaining, the cook was friendly and professional. Really enjoy the remodel the place had. A nice place for a reasonably priced meal and a cold beverage."}
{"text":"The new owners of stow away Pub have invested a lot of time and money to not make this place a bar but a destination while keeping all of the good items from the original bar Bill and Diane have certainly put their mark on this new facility. Come on down for a burger and a brew and enjoy not only great customer service but camaraderie as well."}
{"text":"An alright place with an alright barmaid and really good hand cut fries with vinegar at the table. It took a little while for us to get waited on. All the booths (5 I think) were full and our table was the only table there (party of 6). So our drinks came, then our food. Someone in my party actually asked for another drink and our server said \"in a minute, I have 10 other drinks to make.\" Maybe she shouldn't have said that, maybe they should hire more help, can't blame her for frustration if management doesn't want to hire...but coming from the service industry, I would've never said that to a customer. So, maybe I'll go back, maybe I won't, I'm still deciding because the French fries were REALLY good."}
{"text":"Not my kind of place at all. I thought it was a restaurant, but it's just a dirty bar that serves a little food. When I got there, there were 6-8 middle-aged men slumped over the bar with the waitress behind the bar talking to them. Everyone stared at me when I walked in. No one offered to seat me. I sat at the first of 5 or 6 booths and quickly discovered it hadn't been cleaned. My hands were sticky from what I hope was just jelly or something. The food was ok, but I'll never go there again. I'm pretty surprised they're open. They must make a lot of money on alcohol."}
{"text":"Stowaway is a great burger pub with a great staff. Hometown feel and friendly smiles. Just had lunch with my son and the bulldog burger was fantastic. The onion rings are great too and I am very particular about my onion rings. Great non commercial place to visit.  Chelsea and Katie are awesome and so is everyone else."}
{"text":"I think I'm at about a 3.5. They redid the place, not quite as dive bar anymore, but still a little bit. Definitely townie type patrons.

The biggest problem I have is it seems like they're always understaffed. The servers have always done fine, but just in over their heads. 

$1.50 Wed night sliders are high quality meat, with a perfect toasted bun. It's a really good deal. The burgers are also really good. They use meat from Kirbie's.

My first visit for the fish fry on Friday was some of the best fish I've ever had. Super flaky white mild cod with tasty light breading. But I went back a couple weeks later and the fish was completely different. It was heavily breaded. I took my parent specifically because I know they don't like a lot of breading and it was like I was at a different restaurant. Kind of a weird inconsistency. It's $9.99 for 3 huge pieces or $12.99 for all you can eat. Comes with fries and coleslaw. 

The $1 tacos weren't quite as good as their slider special, but still not a bad deal. Just basic tacos like you'd make at home."}
{"text":"Stowaway is a great little townie secret. It is not large, and the interior is exactly what you would expect in a small town bar, but the overall atmosphere, service, and food is what keeps people coming back.

To start, they serve food LATE, which many bars don't do in the area. And the food is always fresh and consistent! Their stowaway fries consist of either fresh cut or steak fries covered in garlic butter and Parmesan and served on a decent sized pan. They are addictive! Obviously not the healthiest option, but they will keep you coming back for more!

Their burgers use good quality ground beef and are large enough to satisfy even the most voracious of appetites. 

The bartenders are all very nice and love good conversation. Drinks are all reasonably priced, and the pours are fair.

Overall it is a great little spot with a very homey feel. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled, same lack of service. 
Should probably stick to being a bar only.  
Waited over 8 minutes to get a drink - we were the only ones at a table with 5 people at the bar (all had drinks).
One lady worrying about folding shirts and talking. Waitress nowhere to be found. Waited 25 minutes to place an order. Meanwhile, 1 more table came in. Ordered 10 min after us, got their burgers 10 min before we got ours.  Our burgers w/ bacon were undercooked, sent 1 back. Ordered a 1/4lb instead of the 1/2lb. Took more than 15 minutes to make a new 1/4lb burger.  I was the only person waiting on food. Instead of talking, would have been helpful if the tshirt folder could have given the cook some assistance and direction."}
{"text":"Just so you know, this place is a filthy bar. If you can handle that and what that entails (dirty drunks at the bar hollering, filthy and dark setting, etc.) then go ahead.

The food was actually pretty good, considering. But eating in that type of place always makes my appetite dwindle."}
