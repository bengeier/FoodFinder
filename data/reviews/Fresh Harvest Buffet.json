{"text":"The service is great however the food could be better I did not care for the selections, a lot of the food was dried out from the steam tables and dinner is over priced.  29.99 is lot to paid for a buffet when the food is not that great."}
{"text":"The food is ok, not the best or worst.  It is expensive unless you got a buy one get one free voucher."}
{"text":"I was up at the hardrock rocksino yesterday and I would say it was a good experience even though it was my first time going there.

As for the Fresh Harvest Buffet, I would have to say the price for me just for lunch at 13.99 is spot on especially for the quality of food your getting as for the actual food, there were some really good things I loved like the alfredo sauce on the pasta bar and I also loved the manicotti and the cvream of mushroom soup that they had but as far as everything else I had it was just your average buffet food So I am giving the Fresh Harvest buffet a 3 out of 5 and I will be returning and would recommend the place."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch Buffet is awesome. $12.99 Did the clam bake on Friday,  $29.99 all u can eat it was awesome. Prime rib was killer also had salmon. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful selection. My husband and I are very picky eaters and have no problem finding things here. Saturday nights they have T-bone steaks which are pretty good for buffet food. They have different trays for different preferences such as medium well or medium rare. It is pricey but worth it. We occasionally get comp meals there through our gambling reward cards (which is why we tried it to begin with), but have paid full price for it too. Everything is hot and fresh and the service as far as plate removal and refills is excellent. Desserts are plentiful and they have real hand scooped ice cream. I wish I had a bigger appetite because I feel I miss out on some good stuff because I get full. Bonus is that since it's in the casino, there are no kids running around cross contaminating every thing or grabbing things by hand only to put it back, etc.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us seniorscame to Northfield Casino today to have lunch and then gamble. We were surprised to find that there is senior special on Mondays and Tuesdays for $9.99, in addition to a special of only $3.00 for a Bloody Mary. Our only complaint about the food was that although it was generous and varied, it was not hot, but just room temperature."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day as requested by the old folks of the family.  I'm personally not a huge fan of buffets. I get somewhat OCD with large crowds being around food. However, to be a cafeteria-style buffet on one of the busiest holidays , the service and promptness was impeccable. The Fresh Harvest Buffet lives up to its name.  I really enjoyed the fresh pasta bar. The pesto sauce was better than some of the high end Italian restaurants I've been to. There are a lot of food selections for everyone to enjoy themselves: seafood, sugar free desserts, prime rib station, ice cream bar and much more. I was at a table seated for 11 and our server, Drake Cortez was very attentive. We never had to look for him. He was always there picking up plates, topping off our coffees.  You could tell he loves his job. I would definitely recommend coming here for any occasion. Thanks for making our Mothers Day special."}
{"text":"Took our first trip to the Northfield Hard Rock Casino on the bus from Strongsville today and ate lunch at the Fresh Harvest Buffet.  The first thing that you need to know about the buffet is that there are two lines - one for the premier members and one for the peons.  Even with getting in the peon (Rock Star) queue before the buffet opened we still had to wait over half an hour.  I'm glad that Glenn L. posted about the $9.99 Monday and Tuesday price, there is no signage about it inside the casino.  Once we got seated everything was fine, there is a huge food selection.  Food quality ranged from fair to good, nothing great.  The best stations are the salads and the grill.  Good service and everything was kept clean."}
{"text":"Best buffet in area , the got burgers . Hotdogs chicken tenders, chicken ,fish ,pizza, salad, ice cream , cookies ,cake  lunch is when I go, great worker & waitress are the best"}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with quality or service. Advertising breakfast when the buffet doesn't open until 11a is very much  misleading. Im so glad the Dolphin II (Oakwood village) was open at 8a"}
{"text":"There are a lot of good things happening here at the Fresh Harvest Buffet in the Hard Rock Rocksino.  The buffet has seven or so stations that you can get different styles of food.  Some of the areas that stood out are the Carvery station with the roast pork and roast beef.  The International station has some Asian and Mexican items like fried rice, orange chicken and empanadas.  We were here on a Saturday and the t-bone steaks from the grill were popular.  Each station has a ridiculous number of side items to choose from and the dessert spread was amazing.

The service is fantastic and for the price you can not beat the variety of food that you can choose from.  We used our casino Rock Star Rewards card to get a couple $$ off.  This place is a top notch buffet option."}
{"text":"This is one of the consistently best buffets around Cleveland. There's always fresh food, they have it all really. The salad bar isn't something I hit up much because I want my meats and pastas. Seriously, it sounds silly and childish, but I LOVE their mac and cheese. It's not Kraft and it's not your momma's either. There's the staples that stay, and plenty of rotating specials. The pizzas are surprisingly good, and there's a nice selection of \"international\" foods too (think Mexican and Asian). And what's for dessert? A nice array of pies, cakes, cookies, brownies, hard serve ice cream, and even a miniature donut machine that's fun to watch and eat. And yes, there's some pretty tasty sugar free desserts too. 
Honestly, we don't even gamble most of the time; we come just for the food. 

Oh, and don't forget to tip. Just because you get your own food don't think you shouldn't leave gratuity. I always pay ahead when I pay for my meal, that way I don't forget as I gently slip into my food coma."}
{"text":"Always great. Lots to choose from. Service is excellent. Very clean. Lunch is great so is dinner.
This is my favorite Casino in the area so much fun. 
Great shows etc."}
{"text":"We went here on New Years Eve. It was good! Great food and selection. Waitress seemed a little flustered, but it was New Years Eve, so maybe that's why."}
{"text":"The Sunday Buffet is the best deal in town.  Service is very good.  Food is delicious, and lots of choices.....carved meats,  salads, Mexican, pizza, vegetarian, hot dishes, lots of fresh fruits and lots of desserts.  There are no reservatons, but our experience is that the line moves quickly.  Choose a booth or table.  Eat as much as you want.  Everything tastes so delicious. Price is very reasonable.  There are specials most nights.  See my photo."}
{"text":"Usually enjoy eating at the Fresh Harvest Buffet at the Hard Rock casino. The food is usually good, the salads tasty and the service is excellent. Monday and Tuesday they have a $9.99 buffet for card holders and is a bargain as drinks are also included (not liquor) and the evening Buffett after 4:00 is also reduced in price. Would have given the buffet 5 stars for value, but their 29.99 steak and shrimp special (after 4:00) on Saturday has left me wanting much better. The shrimp are good, but the steaks on the 3 occasions I ate there have been tougher than about anyplace else I have ever eaten. The steaks for the most part, if you are able to cut the meat, have also been tasteless."}
