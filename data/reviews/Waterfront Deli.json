{"text":"Loveeeeeee their Jerk chicken, fried chicken and French Fries!!!!! Dumplings are great too! The lady who works there is super nice!"}
{"text":"Whenever I stay at the Westin the first place I head to is the Waterfront Deli. Not only are the staff really friendly but the food is also great. I used to always get the cheese burger combo for around $8.00 a pretty decent price. (They also have  lots of condiments and toppings to choose from). However recently I changed it up and got an egg drop soup which was also amazingly good. I also like that they make most meals right on the spot in front of you (with the exception of the chicken).   P.S. Their muffins are very filling and make a great breakfast choice (I like the blueberry ones the most ;))"}
{"text":"Pretty good selection for a deli and the prices aren't bad. Place feels a little dingy and their chicken was so greasy that it made my stomach hurt. Maybe I'll order something else next time I stop by but for now, not really liking it"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and it's right at the front of Westin Harbour hotel.  The owners are really nice and hospitable. If I come back to Canada, I will come back here!!! Try the fried chicken and curry chicken."}
{"text":"While the guy behind the counter was cooking my son's breakfast, he leaned to the side over a garbage can, loudly cleared his throat, and spit out a huge baloogi. That would be enough said. But I'm compelled to add that everything about the place was disgusting. The staff. The food. The dirty tables. The tube TV. I will never come back of course.  How is it possible that anyone would give more than one star to this place?"}
{"text":"Nice little mom and pop shop. Always looking to support local business. The jerk chicken is very addicting! They sell other quick eats like samosas, beef patties and sandwiches, but I always go back for the jerk chicken!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Toronto cooked by the nicest lady around! I've also had the fried rich which is really tasty and a great price!"}
{"text":"The lady at the Counter is so nice. Mango juice is delicious when fresh. Would recommend coming here as it is one of torontos best restaurants. They served us even past their closing hours"}
{"text":"Fried chicken, tofu, noodles for under $8.  Thin batter, not like chain stores. Enough to last me through lunch and a bit of dinner.  If not fried chicken, you can order jerk chicken.  Tofu had lots of garlic and sauce, next time I hope to try eggplant."}
{"text":"Waterfront Deli is an unassuming family run restaurant right near Lake ON. They have great fried chicken, the general tao chicken and cashew beef are a favourite. The samosas and beef pattys are good too. The lady at the counter is super sweet and friendly. All around quick and tasty food in the perfect location."}
{"text":"It is a simple small lunch joint, although with those hours they will cater to your breakfast or dinner needs as well.  The menu is a mixed bag of different cuisines, seldom do you see jerked chicken, fried rice, and hamburgers so close together on a menuboard.  The combos are properly good deals though; $7.99 gets you a fair-sized serving of food. For a hot-bar, the quality is good. The dine-in atmosphere is very fast-food-ish, but for take-out they have got the recipe right."}
{"text":"I quite like this place. Food is good (very greasy, but I guess that's what makes it good). Staff is nice and friendly.  Only downside is that it smells a bit weird. Other than that, pretty good."}
