{"text":"Service is just okay, don't come here if you are in a hurry. Air conditioner does not regulate well, it goes cold to hot in a matter of minutes. However, the food is delicious and they have live music every once in awhile which is also great."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill in the last few years.  The food isn't very good anymore, service is pretty poor, and it just feels run-down."}
{"text":"Loved this place for over 12 years. Turned into a \"DUMP\" a year ago and never recovered. Last time there the silverware, glasses and tea cups were dirty. Glass had old lipstick on it. Heard its closed, not surprised. What a shame!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Shangri-La for over fifteen years, and can't believe it has such a bad rating!  I've had Chinese food in New York City, and California.  I truly believe Shangri-La is some of the best Chinese I've ever had.  Their hot and sour soup is delicious, and so is everything else I've ever tried on the menu.  I'm really picky, and believe me I don't just give good reviews away.  Please don't listen to bad reviews about this place, decide for yourself.  If you like Chinese food, then you have to at least try Shangri-La in Chandler."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you want authentic Chinese food. They place is so americanized that you can't find an Asian person in there except the waitress. They used to carry a Chinese menu years ago but they got rid of it a while back.  Their customers are all senior Americans. A friend of mine bought a $25 coupon, after the fixed 18% tips and $40-minimum order, you ended up saving 20-30%. The food was horrible!! If all you want is sweet and sour pork, broccoli beef, orange chicken... go order Panda Express. You paying double price here or probably worse quality of food and service. The worst dish we had was what they called \"crispy duck\", it taste like left over from a week ago, they deep fried the crap out of it, the meat is rock solid and you can perhaps hurt someone with it. Even thought it is boneless, the meat texture is very dry. portion is very small, there were like 9 pieces of them. I'm a native Asian and I felt like I betray myself today by walking into this horrible place. They can up sell the price and atmosphere, or offer whatever their target customer like... I'll be ok with that. But cooking shitty food and making a bad name of Chinese food is unacceptable. Please everyone, if you want authentic Chinese food. Go Great Wall in Phoenix, Phoenix Palace or China King in Chandler. Don't eat at this Shangrila place!"}
{"text":"R.I.P. Shangri La? It became tradition to go here once a week with my family. The ambiance was dark, live piano player in the evenings, and a stream of koi under your feet. Even after moving much farther away from Shangri La we would even travel the distance for a large hot and sour soup when someone in the family was sick. I purchased a certificate for my sister recently as she is now living in Chandler again only to find out that they have shut their doors. Not sure if they will be back, but if not I just wanted to write this piece to express my desire for them to come back."}
{"text":"We have been eating there for years and the best on this side of town. Every once in a while things get a little no so nice. Tell the waiter what is wrong, and they cheerfully replace your order. Prices are right and large portions. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Sorry, this place closed about a year ago!  I liked it, had a lovely interior and good food, was there for many years."}
{"text":"Used to come here semi-regularly, but hadn't been in a while. We went the other day for the first time in years and we probalby won't be back. The prices are pretty good and you get a decent amount of food, but the quality of the food is not great. Nothing seems fresh and the flavors are very weak. I believe this place's best days are in the past and unless they improve the food quality, they will be in trouble."}
