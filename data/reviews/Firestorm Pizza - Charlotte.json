{"text":"First visit yesterday 6/7/2017. Found out they were closed.  A sign on door post temporary closed retrain staff something like that.
 

So disappointed was looking forward to the unlimited toppings on pizza."}
{"text":"What a great concept.  Create your own pizza with 
as many or few topping as you like all for 7.99. They have all kinds of toppings from veggies to meats and just about anything you would want on a pizza.  They even have sauces to drizzle on the pizza after it comes out of the oven.  They are thin crust pizzas so they are practically ready by the time you sit down.  Salads are also available. 


They also have a wall of craft beers taps where you pour your own.  It's a great way to sample local craft beers. 

Service was quick, friendly and great.  

On Mondays they have a special of 6.00 pizzas with the purchase of a drink."}
{"text":"Pizza was subpar.  Mod Pizza and Blaze Pizza are definitely a better choice. Won't return here again."}
{"text":"We stopped by at this place for lunch and I was happy with the quality of the food.
The crust and the ingredients of the Classic Margherita pizza were fresh and tasty. I will surely be back for lunch."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Firestorm.  I Went there today with four others and we all loved our pizza's. Firestorm is definitely making it into the rotation."}
{"text":"Super good pizza. Thin crust and endless toppings. Craft beer wall to go with it. Will be back for sure and try different combinations of toppings."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I have had. My boyfriend is from NY and said it was the only place around as good as the pizza there. I love that you can customize it. It's basically like a subway for pizza but the ingredients don't suck. They are the best quality and I wish I could eat there again already haha!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for made-to-order pizza, go somewhere else. As a NYer, I had high hopes for this thin-crust location, especially when they ran a promotion and gave you a coupon on opening day. Unfortunately, it was underwhelming. There are a few in the North Lake area, so you're better off picking somewhere else.

Starting with the pizza: the recommended combos didn't seem that appealing, but they do exist if you're in a rush, or are indecisive. I got the carnivore minus red onions, expecting the \"meat lovers\" classic to be a solid choice. Unfortunately, it all just came off kind of wimpy. The sauce was especially sad. Rather thin, and had that \"fresh out of a can\" taste. I will give them props for having non-pizza options like salad, but if the best thing I can say about your pizza place is \"you have salad\" you're in trouble. They also opted for the standard 6 or 8 spout soda fountain, as opposed to the Freestyle option many casual dining locations are going with nowadays; if you're going to customize your pizza, why not customize your drink too?

And the layout: it's just not intuitive. It's like they didn't beta-test it, or do a walk-through as a potential customer before the opened. When you walk in, you're led right to the take-out menus, and the signage leaves you wandering a bit before figuring out you're supposed to make a hard right as soon as you come in. Once you've turned right, the personalization or pre-made options are kind of hidden behind a pillar. Once you've ordered your pizza, the drinks are in an alcove behind you, so you're left searching for a bit again.  I also know I wasn't the only one left searching for a lid once I got my drink. They're on the wall to the right of the machine, instead of on the left with the straws and literally all the other utensils.

On the whole, I felt like a disoriented child, wandering around the restaurant, only to wind up with a sub-par pizza at the end. Not worth the time."}
{"text":"I've tried numerous build your own pizza places and these is probably the least favorite that I've been too.  The staff was very friendly and good but the pizza was just so so.  The crust was good but the sauce was a bit sour.  The veggies looked like they were several days old.  Not as much of a meat selection as the other build your own pizza restaurants.  With all the other similar pizza restaurants I probably won't return here."}
{"text":"Our 1st experience at Firestorm was nothing short of AMAZING! We loved the atmosphere & the environment. We decided to dine in this particular visit & that's when we fell in love with this place. Our son ate free on that Monday, I mean who could ask for anything better? Oh, let me not forget to mention, the unlimited variety of toppings with your choice of pizza tomato sauce...that IS BETTER! My family loved this place! First impressions are EVERYTHING & they set the bar very high. Especially when it came to \"sub sandwich\" style toppings. So I'm sure you wonder...,\"Why only two stars?\" Well, about 1 week later, we planned another Firestorm pizza date...only to arrive at a closed sign, 3 hours before their actual \"closing time\". They told us it was due to \"electrical issues\". No worries though, we decided to visit another day. Well 1 month or so later, we stopped by to them closed again. We saw employees moving around in the back, yet this time we weren't acknowledged. A few more weeks later, we visited again. No problem with the visit this time. A few new faces were there, not as friendly as our 1st experience, yet the pizza was still nothing short of amazing! We even received 50% on both our pizzas. So, another week later, we visited around lunch time & they weren't open AGAIN! No sign to explain why or anything. At this point we were just over Firestorm. It makes no since that they are inexplicably closed so much. I've never seen a restaurant in my life this unorganized. We actually wanted to visit today, however we thought better of it. We figured we'd wasted our gas & time one too many times before only to be disappointed. We've given up on this Firestorm location. We hope they pull it together one day, but we won't hold our breath. What's funny about the entire situation is, my husband works within a 5mile radius of this location. A few Firestorm employees came into his job to promote Firestorm Pizza. They offered his buisness Firestorm coupons and told him to visit them & try them out. My husband explained to them that they are always randomly closed with no explanation. The Firestorm promoters told him, \"No worries, we've got all that fixed now!\". Ironically, this happened prior to our last visit to Firestorm, where they were closed around lunchtime. So I advise anyone wanting to visit this location to call 1st, & maybe have a backup plan to eat somewhere else. Maybe Firenza Pizza (Northlake) across the street that offers the same style pizza with unlimited toppings, only difference is Firenza bakes their pizza in a Wood Fire Pizza Oven!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, hate the wait. Hire more people quick or you won't have any repeat biz."}
{"text":"Tried to go to Firestorm Pizza for first time today at 12:30 (Tues 3/6) and the place was closed. There was no sign on the door. We decided to go to Firenza instead. Has this location shut down?"}
{"text":"Fairly new \"build your own\" pizza business in the NorthLake area, about a month or two old. 

Good location, always nice to have another quick food option in this area! 

Friendly staff. Little unorganized/flustered behind the counter when too many orders are back to back. \"build your own\" mentality on the pizza, so you truly get what you want and it's all the same price so you're not charged extra for various toppings... so LOAD UP!

Pizza is baked in a brick oven so it doesn't take long. The only thing I didn't like is that the pick-up area isn't really big enough for too many people to wait around at, could be bigger or a slight change of set up to make more efficient. 

Decent amount of seating, both low and high tables.  Drink options were good... draft/bottled/can beer, wine, juices, soda (fountain and bottled), Red Bull, etc... what I'm trying to get across is that you won't go thirsty and most likely they have what you're craving!

It's comparable in price to other pizza places like this and honestly it's closely related to the pricing for other \"fast food\" type options in this area, so if you're craving pizza or to try something different, why not?!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited Firestorm's newest location this evening, and it was fantastic.  My daughter is gluten free, and she said Firestorm's crust was the best she's had anywhere.  Both pizzas were excellent, and the crew was very helpful in explaining the concept and the beer wall which I enjoyed.

The location is well designed and inviting, and Firestorm's thin crust pizza is better than other similar brands (e.g., Pie Five, Pieology and Blaze Pizza) that I've experienced before.  The perfect blend of a crisp crust with lots of cheese and high quality toppings.  I'd recommend this location to anyone looking for a great pizza experience."}
{"text":"I love it here. The pizza is always good and the service is even better. They're always very nice to me and keep me up to date on their many specials they have throughout the weeks. Highly recommend for that \"quick bite to eat\"."}
{"text":"Went back today to get free pizza from previous mess up and while not open in Sundays, Yelp said that location was temporarily closed. Upon further inspection, a Google review under contact us states that \" I'm sorry this location is permanently closed due to violence in the area and a concern for employee safety.\""}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best pizzas I have ever had. $7.99 for a 12 inch pizza with however many toppings you want. They also have the skinny mini which is an 8 inch pizza with anything you want on it and a salad with anything that you want in it. They have beer on tap.....the sweet tea is amazing and you cannot forget to get the breadsticks.....so good. Service is great!Everything is fresh and delicious. This is our first visit here and we love it."}
{"text":"First, for a Friday at noon, Firestorm was extremely understaffed. Four guests walked in at the same time as me and only one employee was available. The wait time was at least 20 minutes, which does not compare to Blaze Pizza who is always very fast and staffed appropriately to keep wait times down. 

Second, as someone living with Celiac disease, I get very excited when I see that a pizza place offers gluten free crust. When I ordered my gluten free pizza, I was told I would need to wait until the others in line with me had their pizzas made so the employee could change his gloves and prepare my pizza separately. That was fine with me as I knew cross-contamination would not be an issue. I waited patiently while the other pizzas were made. When he was finished with the other orders, the employee realized that they did not have any gluten free dough available and could not make my pizza. I wish he would have checked when I placed my order so that I did not have to wait around to ultimately not be able to eat here. Also, to make it worse, I overheard the employee tell another employee who arrived after my wait that he was not going to take the time to make the dough/crust for me, which is terrible customer service and shows me that it actually could have been an option. For Celiacs who have no choice but to eat gluten free, we do not mean to be a problem for the business, but we simply cannot eat a regular pizza. Please do not advertise gluten free options if you are not willing to provide them or take the appropriate measures to prepare enough dough ahead of time for the day."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the concept of this place.  This is my 3rd visit, and the concept of build your own with whatever toppings you wish is great!  Im a big guy, and this is the perfect size for me.  
The only downside was they need more people on staff for a Friday lunch rush.  There were 6 others in front of me and only 2 people behind the counter at 12:30; one cashiering, one taking orders, and both trying their hardest to get pizzas made, cooked, and out to the others.  
It is tough when the people behind me were basically counting the toppings and being very picky with their order, taking up more money or their time.
Dont let that stop you though.... Im sure it was just a fluke today.  Both other visits were great and quick.  Todays pizza was pepperoni, ham, bacon, peppers and shrooms.  Crust was great and crispy, and the pizza was cooked just right.
Great lunch today!"}
