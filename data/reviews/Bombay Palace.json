{"text":"My favourite spot! Food is always amazing. The owner is a kind, lovely man who always provides great customer service. Everyone that I've brought here has quickly become a fan. 

Delicious!"}
{"text":"Good all you can eat take away lunch, the container they give you is a fair size, but all you can eat is about hurting yourself not being fair. Still a good place to eat"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went to Bombay Palace a while back for our anniversary. It was on a weekday and there were very few customers (a little less than I had expected). The environment inside was quite gloomy and it gives you a feeling that the restaurant needs renovating ASAP. 

The menu contained a rather large variety of dishes for you to choose from and since it was my first experience at this restaurant, I let my boyfriend order for us. 

He ordered the 'Palace Sizzling Grill':
- An assortment of Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka, Prawn and Sheekh Kebab served on a sizzler accompanied by a freshly baked Naan and vegetable of the day ($15.95).

I have to admit that this dish has a lot of food for the two of us which means the portion size was definitely worth the price. However, in terms of food quality, it was not that great at all. The meat was SUPER dry and there was no sauce which made it very difficult to eat. 

We also ordered this mango drink and I thought it was average. After the main course, we wanted to try a dessert. 

We ordered: Rasmalai - A popular Indian dessert made of fresh cottage cheese, stewed with pistachio flavored reduced milk ($3.50).

For this dessert, I must say it's the SWEETEST thing I have ever had. It basically tastes like frozen reduced/condensed milk with pistachio bits in it. So I would definitely not recommend you to try that unless you can handle A LOT of sugar. 

Overall, the service was quite good, the environment was not that impressive and the ONE dish that we ordered was not that appetizing. Therefore, I am not trying to say that the food quality is bad overall because maybe other dishes are good. My boyfriend has been to this restaurant before, and he said that their curry dishes were much better so maybe you can give it a try."}
{"text":"Went for a lunch buffet with my work Colleagues
Pros:
Staff was welcoming and took the plates away on time during the Buffet.
Tandoori chicken and Butter Chicken were good.
Goat Curry was good.

Cons:
Samosa seemed stale.
Dal Makhani was disappointing.
Aloo Chaat was tasteless.
Dessert wasn't good.
Very limited options for a buffet.
The buffet area was small so it was often crowded when you go for a refill.

With so many other Indian food options around in the Entertainment District, I would avoid going here in the future."}
{"text":"The food was great. 

Nice , little clean place.
The menu lacks description , but I was able to ask the waiter about anything that sounded interesting. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, food is tasty but portions are small and more expensive than most Indian restos I have been to in the city.  Food was no more tasty than the average Indian place, therefore it should not be significantly higher prices."}
{"text":"We were craving Indian food and ordered from this place off of OrderIt.ca.  I decided to try it as they were willing to give me 20% off my first order since I hadn't ordered from them before.

We really should have gone with our go-to for Indian food (Kama) because this was a disappointment from the start.

We ordered the vegetable pakoras, which arrives soggy, and without the tamarind and mint chutney which was said to come with them.  Strike one!  

When we got to the paneer, there were maybe three or four chunks of cheese in the sauce.  The tomato sauce tasted like a tomato bisque with some added heavy cream - all in all, not flavorful, not original, and pretty inauthentic.  The fact that there was next to no paneer in the sauce either made me wonder why they didn't bother sending me their tomato soup instead.  It tasted like bland crap.  

We ordered the butter naan and the garlic naan.  The garlic naan had no garlic on it.  The butter naan had no butter on it and tasted strongly of heavy yeast. 

The gulab jamin we ordered just added insult to injury to the entire meal.  They were definitely store bought - incredibly small, dry and not worth the money at all.  

I wouldn't order again from her, nor recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We went to Bombay Palace yesterday, and we loved it. We didn't try the buffet, we went for the a la carte menu. 

I really enjoy indian food, so I may be biased a bit, but the samosas, the rice, the garlic naan and the tandoori chicken were really awesome. It is a bit more expensive then some other indian restaurants in the city, but I didn't mind because I really enjoyed their food.

Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the staff is also friendly."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Buffet was excellent and the service was outstanding. We were handed clean plates every visit to the buffet and recommended pairings. Everything on the buffet was fresh, spicy, and all at an affordable $12.99. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"We had such an amazing time celebrating our sons first birthday party here @ Bombay Palace. The food and service was on point! Thank you for helping us create such amazing memories. Your wait staff was so helpful and kind, everyone is so professional and willing to help! The food was delicious, we received many compliments with the venue. I highly recommend Bombay Palace for dining and even small group gatherings, they are very accommodating and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent independent Indian restaurant. They've taken over a previous restaurant called Southern Spice. We've had the chicken korma, garlic naan, and chole bhature -- all of it excellent. It's a quiet place given the recent changeover, and service is fast - it feels like a temporary secret that we should enjoy before it starts overflowing."}
{"text":"We came here to pick up food we ordered online. We got the tandoori platter for two ( chicken, beef, shrimp) and it was okay. The chicken and beef were a bit dry and kind of bland. In contrast, the garlic naan bread was tasty but I feel like that's kind of difficult to mess up. 

Will I come back? Probably not, but it was worth a try."}
{"text":"Meh. Service is attentive and eager but not too competent. (E.g. We ordered Cabernet and got tepid Chardonnay.) Food was so-so. Not as good as Delhi Palace. The spinach part of the palak paneer was reminiscent of school lunch spinach (maybe canned?); the amount of sauce in the lamb and chicken dishes was disproportionate to the meat--there were only a few bites of meat to a good 1.5 cups of sauce. None of the three curries or the birjani was memorable."}
{"text":"Food was good on scale of 1 to 10 it was 7. Apitizer was ok mini samosa was from costco!!
Deserts were excellent."}
{"text":"We have hosted multiple events at Bombay Palace and the food and service are both always impeccable, which is why we keep going back. They serve innovative dishes like murgh methi malai, lamb bhuma masala, etc. All of our guests always leave talking about the delicious food. The bartenders and food servers seem to enjoy their jobs and so are really friendly and great to work with. Manprit made sure our event went without a hitch on multiple occasions. Can't recommend them highly enough!"}
{"text":"Dined here recently while on a visit to Brampton, familiar with the name and food, due to having frequented the downtown location. 

An extremely delightful experience from the moment we came through the door. First being greeted by whom appeared to be the owner. He potentially is a fixture in the restaurant, asking if this was our (my family and I) first time there, perhaps not recognizing us. I struck a conversation mentioning we had dined on numerous occasions in Toronto, and he informed me that was his uncle's location.

Anyhow, we had Mango lassi, which were perfect, not too thick and not too thin. An abundance of fresh roti was replenished, both plain and garlic. Hot, crisp yet soft. Perfect dining consistency. 

Pakoras, samosa, papadum. Chutnies as well as a variety of salads were available for appetizers. All kid friendly at that, nothing too spicy.

For main courses. A healthy variety of mild carnivore (Lamb and chicken) and vegan curries, as well, as a plus any spicy curries were labeled as such. In addition, tandoori and tikka chicken pieces were available to enjoy (which I did) as well a biryani was available, but I did not indulge, as I filled up on the delicious selections of curries. My son was most partial to the shahi paneer. I love them all, and fully enjoyed the variety of authentic flavours.

The desert table was filled with all the typical Indian sweets as well as ice creams, from which I enjoyed a nice bowl of pistacio. 

One extra added bonus was presumably due to our friendly demeanor, and my almost 6 yr old son not only knowing curries but also eating  them authentic Indian style (hands and roti, no cutlery) they only charged us the infant price of 1.99 or maybe 2.99$ instead of the childs price of 10.99$ for a meal.

10 outta 10, great food, great experience, will definitely return to this place"}
{"text":"For a place that sells butter chicken for $16 and describes it in their menu as \"Taste the ORIGINAL - Feel the Difference,\" I was expecting the dish to be authentic and amazing. It fell completely flat and was not authentic at all-- it simply tasted like tomato sauce with no hint of spices.

Saag paneer was decent, but nothing to write home about.

I love my naan thin and crispy on the outside but the naan that came to my table was too thick and bready. It tasted like something I could get at the grocery store.

Waiters were friendly but service was slow. This was one of the most disappointing (and expensive) Indian places I've been to in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went today for the buffet, the server was very polite and knowledgeable. He told us some really good tips on what to mix! Excellent service and great food! 

Goat curry is kick ass!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing !!
The food is really great!! I really like the butter chicken here. 
Their chaat and pani puri tastes amazing.
The staff is extremely friendly. 
A couple years ago they did renovation to theirs halls and the difference is like night and day!
If you get a chance to check out the big hall you must!
Washrooms are always clean"}
{"text":"Having moved to the neighbourhood recently and having walked past this place almost daily, I figured it was worth a shot.  We walked in on a Sunday evening to find the place deserted, but we were greeted warmly and seated.  As Sundays is buffet-only, we walked up to the food to fill our plates but were then greeted again, only this time by a cockroach climbing up the wall above one of the dishes.  After a shared look of disgust, we decided to collect our jackets and go elsewhere.

This place needs to close down.  If you're in the area and want Indian food, I suggest Bindia - which is a short walk away."}
{"text":"My last review was put in not recommended, So I am reiterating again:
pros:
-- chicken tandoori is good.
-- fennel seeds (mouth freshener) after dinner.
cons:
-- daal makhani which is terrible.
-- paapri chat which looks and tastes terrible.
-- and the so called lentil soup.
Definitely not worth place for any taste buds"}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. Ordered $80 worth of food through Foodora and was extremely disappointed, you could not feed 3 people with this amount. The methi chicken tikka is $17 and you get 7 pieces of toonie sized chicken. The butter chicken was the same problem, the container was filled with sauce and had maybe 10 pieces of chicken the size of a quarter. The saag included maybe five chunks of paneer. When I called the restaurant immediately after delivery the response was \"those are our prices\". There was NO attempt to provide any customer service or resolution. When I asked for a manager I was told \"there isn't one here right now\".
Avoid this place at all costs, not worth the prices and they care nothing for the customers spending money there."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not good at all. The food was not that great. Very oily and salty, and not flavourful like Indian food should be. 

It's definitely pricey compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to, and there's no value, even if you use Groupon or whatever.

The place is a tad dirty and run down. I went during winter, and they just had a bunch of space heaters around the place. 

Our server was very polite and kind, which is always nice."}
{"text":"Wonderfully authentic Tandoori food with a surprisingly high quality for a buffet. The staff were wonderful and personable. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just as we got seated and waiting for the menu, 3 ft from us on opposite wall was a cockroach. We showed it to the waiter, he removed it with a napkin and offered us a different table! We just left ....our appetite was gone! Place looks run down too. Were are the food inspectors?"}
{"text":"For appetizer, instead of samosas they have horrible vegetable spring rolls. The naan is a little too thick.  The goat or lamb curry is way too salty.  The eggplant dish has way too much ginger in it.  The daal makhni has too much masala and not enough cream.  The rice pudding tastes like overcooked raw porridge.

The mango ice cream and the custard were the only memorable items."}
{"text":"The food is very average and yet again oily. The customer service is terrible as they make you wait a while for the food and bill."}
{"text":"Rajiv and his entire team were a dream to work with! We planned a surprise 25th anniversary for my aunt uncle and hosted it last weekend. From the absolute beginning, Rajiv was accommodating, flexible and kind. During our first conversation, it felt like we had known each other for years! Leading up to our event, he was responsive over email/text/phone... Can't say that to be true with other restaurants I've worked with! The day of our event, he helped out with everything possible. He even came in early so we could decorate the restaurant to our liking. Though we didn't need to decorate it too much, because it is such a beautiful restaurant. The food was excellent, all of our guests enjoyed it very much. And most importantly, our guests of honor (my aunt and uncle) had the most incredible time. Rajiv and team, thank you for everything that you've done and for helping us create beautiful memories!"}
{"text":"Went to explore this place with family. Good display of buffet items and sweets. They could improvise on chicken tandoori with little more masala and veg Manchurian could be less sweeter.
Servers were good and quick as well. I will recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"The food is good keeping in mind this is a buffet place.

I came with coworkers during lunch and we made reservation before hand. Seems like they make most of the money from the events in the halls but their restaurant area is of a decent size. They had many veg and non veg dishes. Fresh naan will come to your table so you don't have to worry about that! and there were quite a few choices for desserts. 

Overall, Good Place many choices of dishes from appetizers to mains to desserts, plenty of parking and good service."}
{"text":"The place is run down, the food is typically comprised of the cheapest and lowest quality ingredients, and I've gotten sick after eating here. There are MUCH better options in the area, I would avoid Bombay Palace like the plague."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of BP mainly because of the consistency of the dishes, we usually loved the buffet style food. Lately, however, my wife and I agreed that the dishes to us have become predictable and to be frank, boring. Yes, the sauces are spicy and flavorful, the naan is always fresh and tasty and the butter chicken melts in your mouth. BUT:

Despite the consistency and taste (4 stars) there is simply nothing extraordinary about BP and the atmosphere makes me think \"seniors day\". The dining room is dark and imposing, definitely would need a more contemporary design makeover. The menu could use fewer but more exciting a la carte highlights and what's more important, a stronger seasonal and regional influence.

BP has good tasty food, yet a not exactly authentic menu. Atmosphere is rather old-fashioned and a tad musty. Go there if you crave indian food and have nothing else to explore, but it's not fireworks - just very tasty."}
{"text":"3 stars because we ended up leaving and didn't try the food, so I don't want to be rude... 
The sign said closed but they were open, the lady seemed nice.. but odd atmosphere... no music which, when there's only 3 other tables, it can make it kind of awkward... and unfortunately it was only a buffet, no menu?
Won't be back :("}
{"text":"I had a groupon and decided to use it but even with the discount the buffet was horrible.

The food was not even average. It was actually terrible. The place was dirty. I will never return - even if the food was free."}
{"text":"I liked biryani but methi malai matar was not good. But yes it's reasonable and they are nice too."}
{"text":"We were in Brampton for a wedding, and being from out of town we weren't sure where to go for dinner. My grandmother is a picky eater so we're always wary of trying new Indian restaurants but based on some recommendations from locals, we went to Bombay Palace for dinner. Do yourself a favor and go eat here! And please keep an eye out for Mr Deep... he's an absolute gem of a person and took personal care of us. The food was wonderful, the buffet spread is quite impressive, and the quality was great. The service was excellent, even when they had a large event happening in one of their event spaces. Notable dishes: their vegetable pakora was yummy; their chaat selections are pretty good, and the butter chicken was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already and it's always a wonderful experience. The food is always  fresh and warm. The fish pakoras are my favourite! Everyone is always so friendly there and I like the decor."}
{"text":"Someone suggested that we go to Bombay Palace since it's close to the office.  In all honesty, I've always been scared to try Indian food, for fear of not liking it.

I think every nightmare was lived with this restaurant.  As soon as you open the door, you smell this really strong aroma.  The blend of curries and strong sauces was unbearable.  

Needless to say this experience just got progressively worse.  It's a buffet, and I think it was $14.  Everything was just full of rich sauce that had this pungent odour.  
I took one bite and I felt so sick afterwards. 

Dining at this restaurant makes me want to add 3 stars to the rest of my reviews, because this was by far the worst dining experience ever.  I didn't eat anything, except  some bread without sauce.  I think they may have had some desserts, but I remember Indian desserts are just sugar on sugar.

If you like Indian food, maybe this is for you.  Even if you paid me, I wouldn't come back, it was that bad.  Even a 5 year old who puts random ingredients could make something better than the food here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having Indian food, and it was delishhh. 

According to my Indian friend it was a lot more westernized than their traditional food, but I guess thats also the case with Asian buffets. 

This review is making me want to go back.... an Indian food crave... now thats a first."}
{"text":"100% amazing, spicy (if you want), authentic Indian food. Take the lack of descriptions in the menu as a sign of the restaurant's authenticity and your opportunity to learn what some dishes are without a cheat sheet. The server will describe what things are if you have questions or, if you are ordering takeout, you can GFG it.

This is no longer Southern Spice, and the mediocrity of that other restaurant is no longer there, either.

We've ordered takeout several times through GrubHub and LOVED IT. They honor requests of spiciness and make it just right. Kormas, vindaloo, biryani, paneer or chicken tika masala, basmati rice and samosas have all been piping hot, fresh, served with love and absolutely delicious.

Go go GO. Forget any other restaurant that has ever been in that location."}
{"text":"I'm in town for business and decided to try this place because it happens to be just down the street from my hotel; I'm now thanking my lucky stars that I booked the hotel that I did, because I otherwise wouldn't have stumbled upon this place.  I was dining alone, and the service was attentive but not obtrusive.  The saag paneer and naan were flavorful and delicious; the juicy slices of tomato in the saag paneer were a nice touch.  I'd go back without hesitation!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The whole
menu is great. I'm from out of town, but when in Toronto I make a point to stop by. Any rating under 4 star must be some bad experience with a delivery service. Let's GO Red Wings!!"}
{"text":"The last time I came here was before my recent visit which was ten years ago. It has changed so much from the exterior to interior. The once huge dining area has been reduced to half the size. The other part is now their banquet hall. I remember the buffet table had so many items to choose from, items that are not normally served at typical Indian buffets. We had an awesome culinary experience and were looking forward to repeat but it ended up being an OK experience this time. I found that the vegetarian dishes tasted better and had more flavor than their non-veg dishes. The saag paneer, sholay, gobi were all delicious but there was one non-veg item that I absolutely loved and it was their methi chicken. Another plus is they bring fresh naan to the table.
The service was good in the beginning but then the server disappeared when we ready to leave. We flagged him down to get our check. I doubt we will be back since we have found some other gems in the area."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to Indian place prior to discovering the larger buffet up the road. Honestly, while the buffet at Bombay Palace is smaller, the food is often fresher and tastier. Indian buffets have since saturated the area, but for the taste of an original, Bombay Palace doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm the first one to review this Brampton classic. I've been going to Bombay Palace rarely for the past 10 years or so for parties and dinners, and almost as a rule I've always been pleased with the spread. 

During weekdays, Bombay Palace has a lunch buffet ($12) which is not as extensive as Brar's offering but much better in terms of quality and service. The owner of this location and the staff are extremely courteous and hospitable. BP has local business clientele, where as Brar's appeals more to families and children.

They offer the option of made-to-order flavoured paranthas and roti in the buffet line-up, thus not limiting you to the doughy naans -so that's a huge plus in my books. The buffet has a decent variety of vegetarian and meat dishes, as well as Pani Puri and Chaat Papri. 

I recommend the tandoori chicken as it's really well-made and tender on the inside. I'm docking one star, since the rasmalai for desert seemed to actually be a flattened syrupy rasgulla instead of a creamy rasmalai. 

All in all I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've gone here for a buffet lunch on several weekdays, and it's great when you have the need for some comfort food.  The owner always make it a point to personally greet you and is very attentive to your needs.  This alone gets this place points, in my books, and probably explains why this place has been around as long as it has.   The food itself is decent, nothing amazing as far as Indian food goes, but hearty and a good value for the buffet.  If it's your first time, they will hook you up with coupons/discounts galore to encourage subsequent visits."}
{"text":"Indian buffet with a few classic Indian dishes such butter chicken, assorted curries and samosa.  

Curries are really good, but the ice cream cone is soggy.

For takeout you can get some items that are not available in the buffet."}
{"text":"The food was great but the cherry on the cake was the service. The waiter was so sweet and kind and made recommendations throughout the meal. As vegetarians we really appreciated this to ensure we didn't eat any items with meat by mistake."}
{"text":"Surprisingly happy with this dinner choice, although they could use air conditioning! 

Used a groupon, which I felt worth it as the food was shockingly expensive for Indian. That being said, what we ordered - malai kofta type \"cottage cheese and vegetable koftas\" with garlic naan ($4 for one serving of garlic naan?!!) Was delicious, flavorful and hearty without being greasy or overly spiced. 

That being said, $3 for a wine-glass worth of watery flat coke?! Did they give me a more expensive menu for my groupon? (I laugh but I hear some establishments practice this)

But let's get to the important, standout function of this visit and primary reason I'm reviewing - the service was fantastic. Slow sometimes, although the food came out at reasonable times. Our servers were exceptionally polite and courteous. I'm a sucker for being seated chivalrously!

Cute touches like bringing the check in a decorative box. 

Overall a good experience I would repeat with an eye to my wallet."}
{"text":"A sudden tandoori chicken craving drove me to this place last week, I left quite agitated and disappointed because the craving for ACTUAL tandoori chicken just increased. 
This buffet was one of our poor judgements and we regretted it at the first bite. The food was cold, there was Chinese noodles in the middle of an 'authentic' Indian buffet. The chaat was up to the mark but everything else seemed to be a let down. The food was cold, the naan was rubbery, the rasmalai was spoilt, the spread wasn't impressive, the malai kababs were tasteless etc. 
The service was good though and very welcoming, we also really enjoyed the gulab jamuns. Everything else however was a sad excuse for Indian food and I would not recommend this place to anyone I like."}
{"text":"It's shocking for me to see these negative reviews below! I do see that they service lots of tourist buses with a buffet, but I've always gone there for dinner and/or take-out at least 10 times. Their saag paneer is so good. It's my favourite. I can't really say anything about any of their other dishes except their chicken madras is the owners' favourite and I find it \"meh\".  Their garlic naan is okay, a bit doughy for my taste."}
{"text":"Came here for takeout buffet -- was ok.
Butter chicken was kind-of runny.
Saag Paneer (Spinach & Cheese) had only small (and infrequent) pieces of cheese in it.
Tandoori chicken was ok.
Veg Korma seemed more like Aloo Gobi (sp?) because there really wasn't much of a korma-like sauce that I was expecting..
I did like the veg dumplings though."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Bombay Palace twice on a recent trip to Toronto. As newcomers to the city, we stumbled upon the restaurant quite by accident the first time, but loved it enough to come back the next day.

Bombay Palace had a reasonably priced lunch buffet with hot choices like chana masala, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, beef curry, and eggplant masala. A separate cold bar had all the fixings, like a simple salad, mango chutney, raita, rice pudding. There was even a small case of chocolate, vanilla, mango, and strawberry ice cream/sherbet. The best part - everything was great! The naan went fast and was gone by the time we went to the buffet, so the waiter/host brought us a fresh serving from the kitchen. Out of this world! He told us it would be the best naan we'd ever have, and he was right.

Speaking of the service, the host (I believe his name is Rajiv) was incredibly friendly and helpful. You could tell that Rajiv loves his restaurant and his job. He made us feel welcome and answered all our questions about the food and restaurant (and the silly Canadian HST tax).

The next night, we ended up at Bombay Palace again - this time for dinner. Instead of a buffet, we ordered from the menu and were completely blown away. The chicken tikka masala was savory with the perfect balance of onions, tomatoes, and green peppers. My chicken korma was the best I've ever had. Not too sweet, not too creamy, and a wonderful hint of coconut and ginger. The chicken was moist and plentiful. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back to Toronto. At lunch the day before, Rajiv urged us to try the garlic naan. We were so full that we didn't, so we ordered it at this dinner. Words cannot describe the deliciousness of that bread. Most places use too much garlic and overpower the naan; not Bombay Palace. The naan was slightly crispy on the outside, nice and fluffy on the inside, and the garlic just hit it out of the park. Ever heard of the show \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" - Bombay Palace's garlic naan and chicken korma would be (one of) my pick(s) for that show.

Our first and last meals in Toronto were enjoyed at Bombay Palace and I can't think of a better way to bookend our trip."}
{"text":"I've been to their Lunch Buffets a handful of times...Buffets though a good option, are not exactly a good mirror of a restaurant's strengths & weaknesses...

So I decided to stop by for Dinner on a Sunday...Upon entering, I discovered that they have a Sunday Dinner Buffet as well...The dinner buffet's priced a tad bit higher than the usual lunch buffet, and the choice of dishes is better qualitatively and quantitatively...

However, I wanted something different as asked if I can order from the menu (À-la-carte) and the server said I could...No asking to check with the chef or anything, which tells me that they can and do accept À-la-carte even during the lunch/dinner buffets...

While I was waiting for my dish, I was served a couple of rolled-up papadums and 2 small bowls, 1 with carrot pickles, and the other with tamarind sauce...The appetizers and the entrées were delicious, warm, and perfectly spiced...

Given what I've seen and had during their buffets and À-la-cartes, I'd definitely stop by when visiting the downtown core...

Be advised, while their food is decent, it's a bit saltier than other most Indian establishments."}
{"text":"So after a couple weeks of me wanting a combination of wanting spice and buttery and salty things, all thanks to me being pregnant, my hubby FINALLY won in his mission to get me to try Indian Cuisine. Seriously. It was more of an off handed suggestion that we trade in my Chinese request for Indian and my spice craving offspring overtook my brain and the voice that yelped \"YES!!!\" sounded like something out of the exorcist.

A short time later we found ourselves at Bombay Palace, a brand new Indian restaurant my darling hubby had spied being built during our many trips to Big Lots (my obsession).

It took us quite awhile to be seated, another customer picking up catering goods actually flagged down the hostess who in turn seated us. They also obviously don't use their AC... Which made life kind of interesting and had me rolling up my pant legs under the table - a culinary experience FIRST for me.

My friend, who was joining us, and I inquired about foods that wouldn't burn our virgin (to Indian ;) ) mouths off and the hostess/waitress quickly sent the chef out who's a rather charming East Indian man. He guided us straight and true and suggested I order the Chicken Korma Curry in mild.

Mild did NOT mean watered down and Americanizes. It meant not fire in your face, but enough of a kick to keep life interesting.

Oh. My . God.

Seriously.

Oh. My. God.

I was born in the wrong neck of the woods.

Indian food is my new calling in life and I will NEVER EVER not trust my husband's culinary decisions EVER again! This restaurant is INCREDIBLE and I hope it stays forever, EVERYONE needs to try Bombay Palace and share it with everyone they care about because sharing is caring and this food totally equals LOVE.

I would so give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the slow start and lack of AC. Seriously. I'm in love."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here at the restaurant but attended for an event.  Easy to get to, ample parking, inside is mediocre."}
{"text":"This one's tough. On the one hand, we saw incredible customer service for the first ten minutes of our visit - personable, attentive, helpful. On the other, we saw that quickly turn when we attempted to use a coupon purchased online that they wouldn't accept through the site's mobile app. Then he never really came back.

The drink selection is good on the wine front and okay on the cocktail front (avoid the mango martini - the purée is WAY too filling), and the food menu is a compact but diverse two pages.

I think the best use of Bombay Palace would definitely be to go in a big group of sharers. At $10-12 a pop, dishes are too pricy (and big) to get a whole bunch between two people, but perfect for sharing if you want to get a taste of many things. 

The vegetable korma was a stand-out, I'd probably skip the Chana Masala."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet. It was good, but not amazing. But that's usually the case for buffets in general...."}
{"text":"Poor food quality. Lunch buffet is evidently mass produced as cheap as possible. The food was quite tasteless; it lacked any real flavour, (which was shocking as this is never the case for Indian food.) You had to search through the sauce to even find a piece of paneer. Wouldn't go back. Definitely did not get $15 worth of food. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for this place and on a cold night like this, I thought it would be a good time to eat Indian food!

We ordered the chicken vindaloo and 2 naan for pick up and my order was ready in 15 mins. 

The man at the restaurant was so nice and courteous, very helpful. The restaurant itself feels very intimate yet spacious. Clean interior but a bit outdated.

The food was hot and spicy - just what I wanted. I'm only giving 2 stars because it's very pricey. 

Main entrees start around $16 and plain naan costs $3. I come from Brampton so you know these prices are wayyy over what I'm used to. 

I'd come here more often if the prices were a bit more reasonable."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. For a little while they had made their food rather mild, but they came back and it's as good as ever. Lots of salad (including an awesome bhel puri) and dessert selections as well as hot food, and fresh naan constantly being replenished on the buffet.

Mango lassi is thick and fruity, and the masala coffee is nice too. Watch for kheer and gulab jamun on the dessert table."}
{"text":"This is a place that I go every time I'm in downtown Toronto. During my most recent visit, the service was perfect and so was the food. I'm obsessed with butter chicken, and have had it at at least 40 different locations across North America. I can say with certainty that this place has the best, and the helpings are massive. Their samosas and tandoori chicken are also quite good here. For the price, it really is hard to go wrong. 

The atmosphere is authentic as I have seen for Indian restaurants and the location is within walking distance of most major landmarks in the downtown. 

I have eaten here at least 10 times and will continue to go back every time I make it to Toronto.

During my visits I have encountered some forms of awkward service. This is the only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5. If you get the right servers, the experience here can be absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Ended up here on Easter Monday as a lot of places were closed, and my friend was tired of searching the area for somewhere to eat. I rarely go to places cold (ie. without doing research on them) as they rarely turn out well... this was one of those times.

The service was excellent. Very friendly. Very attentive.
The food is sub par for sure. I didn't even both attempting to eat the butter chicken or goat curry, and the pieces seemed to be mostly bone. I tried the tandoori chicken which was okay but dry. The various fritters tasted like they had been sitting there a while and were not crisp. The veg curry was VERY mushy and overcooked. The rice, naan, and chickpea dishes were by far their best. But it was a bit expensive for chickpeas, rice and naan.

They could really use a paneer dish... as I don't think you can over cook that, and it wouldn't dry out.

Definitely wouldn't go back. Not sure what else to say."}
{"text":"Holy microwave city Batman! Service is so good here that I feel nearly guilty for complaining, but the food is inconsistently cooked/re-heated. The butter chicken was terrible - it was like chunks of processed chicken breast in a lukewarm sauce from the grocery store. I have the feeling I got someone else's order of stuffed bread because it contained ingredients I didn't order, but I didn't say anything because I was cold and hungry."}
{"text":"Went to check out the lunch buffet, appears to be out of business...no hours posted on the sign outside."}
{"text":"While I was on a business trip, I stopped at this place for Indian food.  The manager seated me and he was very friendly.  My food was great.  Expensive, but Indian food usually is in a nice place.  
My Asian waitress was struggling to understand my English, but I was patient and ordered a meal and a beer.  When I was finished I asked her to give me 2 separate checks. One for the food, and one for the beer. 
Guess what she does.... she brings me another $7 Kingfisher beer. Me being a nice guy, explained in very slow English what I needed.  And instead of making a big deal of the situation, and because she would not understand what I was saying anyway, I told her it was okay, I would drink and pay for the beer I did not order or want. That adds up to $14 in beer I have to pay out of my own pocket. 
So when my checks come, guess what? She informs me that they cannot take my credit card because their terminal is broken. And she points across the street and mumbles something about ATM.
I believe someone, including the manager who seated me, and could speak English, should have warned me about the broken cc terminal. I left $0 for a tip, hoping they knew why.... If they thought I was a cheap ass, now they will know why."}
{"text":"It's a pretty run of the mill Indian restaurant though with top notch service and above average decor.

I went for their lunch buffet one weekend and was very surprised by their meager selection. Their veggie spread was adequate,  but their meat section seemed like an afterthought: two meat curries and tandoori chicken. Their desert selection didn't have  gulab jamun and the like. Usually buffet restaurants ramp it up on the weekend, perhaps Bombay Palace does that for their buffet dinners.

The veggies were all very forgettable, the samosas had clearly come out of a frozen packet. The beef curry was flavorful and the tandoori chicken was very moist and flavored. Major props for that! However, I couldn't tolerate the butter chicken which was disgustingly sweet. The rice pudding was similarly half assed.

The lunch buffet gets a solid two. Bombay Palace needs to step up its game if it wants to compete with the other Indian buffets in town."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Fantastic food and unparalleled service. I ordered a large number of items for 100+ guests for catering, and Rajiv provided the hands down the BEST customer service I've ever experienced. He asked questions in order to customize the menu, taking care in presenting options that were appropriate to our variety of tastes and dietary restrictions. On the day of, Rajiv was on-site, assisting with delivery, and he was so extremely kind and helpful. I will definitely continue using Bombay Palace Toronto as a catering supplier and I HIGHLY recommend them for any corporate catering."}
{"text":"The small front room was surprisingly full when we walked in for dinner on a recent weeknight. The two servers on the floor seemed genuinely friendly, but unfortunately also not the most efficient. It took a very long time to get menus and then even longer for some water even after we requested politely. 

The food itself was quite good at least. The pappadams, served with a thick sweet and sour dipping sauce as well as tiny cubes of pickled carrots were a nice little on-the-house appetizer. The pleasantly aromatic navratna korma ($8.95) which I had expected to feature chunks of freshly cooked vegetables disappointingly consisted of only frozen corn, peas, and diced carrots. The saag paneer ($9.95) was as pleasingly thick and richly spinachy as the best with large, creamy cubes of paneer throughout. The non-stretchy naan ($2.50) and the fluffy basmati rice ($4.95) were just okay.

Although new bottles of Kingfisher beer ($5.25) were quick to be brought and water refills constant, we were also charged for an extra iced tea that was ordered, but never arrived. 

There were two stalls in the women's bathroom of which neither door locked properly. All was forgotten when I returned to the table and was greeted by a fluorescent globule of free mango ice cream though. 

My friend who lives just across the street swears by the take out from Bombay Palace. That, or perhaps the lunch buffet, is what I would recommend instead of dining in on a busy night."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Chicago and just picked this from GPS. But it was a nice surprise. Good food, great service especially from the manager himself who was serving and helping too. Very personable! One suggestion i would make to themselves is that through out the evening someone should check the buffet, like try the food to make sure nothing spoiled. The pani puris were stale. The chole and a mango cabbage salad was really good!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were arguing over which restaurant was the best in Toronto. One of them insisted it was Bombay Palace and after trying this place, I still prefer The Host because you just can't beat the butter chicken at The Host. 

That said, the prawn marsala here is WONDERFUL. My friends and I were scrambling over the last bits of sauce with our naan. That's how good it was -- we were fighting over the dredges. 5 stars for this dish.

We were a large group so we ordered various dishes. The butter chicken was too tomato-ey and nothing special. That's what I find -- unless you get the butter chicken at The Host, there's really nothing great about this dish. It's a safe innocuous dish for timid eaters. The pakoras were good. The saag paneer was decent. We also ordered lentils, but I thought it was weird that the lentils were cooked with red beans. It tasted more like Mexican than Indian. I don't care for lentils and I *really* don't care for lentils with beans.

We also ordered mango dacquiris, which were delicious, but barely had any alcohol. But it was very tasty. It tasted like they pureed a fresh mango right then and there. Would have been better with more alcohol. And if it were colder. 

Anyway, Bombay Palace was really nice to us and gave us free mango ice cream afterward. Tasty!"}
{"text":"We love coming to Bombay Palace for buffet lunch! Great value, delicious food and decent service! The owner is very polite and kind!"}
{"text":"I got a Groupon and it was about to expire, so I decided to head there tonight.  There were many factors that contributed to this negative review.
When my friend and I arrived we were greeted warmly and seated. The service was good and the server was attentive.
Groupon was $10 for $20. We decided to try the Sizzling Tandoori Grill ($23) to hit the price and try different meats and seafood. Would have been perfect but he said they'd be closing soon and it'd take 20 minutes. We opted for King Prawns ($20) and Aloo Gobhi ($12) instead, which ended up taking longer than 20 minutes.
Food was hot and smelled great.  The King Prawns was okay, but nothing special. If you're not a fan of spicy food or can't handle it, then I strongly recommend not coming here.  I downed 2 glasses of water and took a break - but I don't have a high tolerance for spice. Be warned. The portions were adequate and I wasn't as wow-ed as I should be for how much it cost.
Moreover, my friend went up to pay and was informed that there was a $6 'surcharge' for our $35 meal. That should have been agreed on earlier. Before we left, I asked what the fee was about and he said it was gratuity. Before knowing this, my friend had went ahead and paid for the meal, 'surcharge', and an additional 15% tip.
I understand this is a business but I feel like they're playing their customers. I don't say this about a lot of places, but I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"The best Indian Buffet in the area. Price is solid. Tandoori oven naan complimented the enormous variety of curries both veg and non veg. It was nice to see some chaat as well as the normal butter chickens and vindaloos. They had lots of other less typical dishes to try. Food was fresh and staff were helpful. I will return. Hidden gem for sure"}
{"text":"DON'T GO! Don't make the same mistake we did. We love the Scarborough location so we bought 2 vouchers ($12 for $25) to use at the downtown location, expecting it to be better/classier. Food was meh. Nothing special, not for the prices. Waiter was rude and slow (and had b.o. :-S ). The coupon  said u are was allowed to use two vouchers PER TABLE, which is what we planned to do. He refused us, and was adamant that we cannot use 2. We explained in detail what the voucher said, but he blamed it on Teambuy. He just repeatedly keep saying rudely, \"sorry sir, one voucher per table\". After a good ten minutes we just walked to the cash and were ready to pay our bill fairly with both vouchers. He still refused and said $30 extra. We then refused and told him, do whatever u want, call the police, but we are only paying what is fairly owed. So we left the two vouchers and paid $15. Obviously no tip."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this restaurant when I worked downtown, as it was close to the office and had by far one of the best Indian Buffets in the area.

I revisited this place on Feb 29, 2013 after not dining here in at least 5 years. While impressed by the service, the food selection was unimpressive for a buffet, so I will unfortunately not make the trek here anymore.

We were greeted almost immediately upon entering and promptly shown to a table, were offered drinks, which were on our table when we returned from the buffet station. Our waiter checked back 5 minutes later to see if we needed anything else and to ask if we were enjoying the food. Plates were cleared promptly. Attentiveness was great, although unassuming.

The hot food selection was a disappointment....like other reviewers I am a huge fan of Butter Chicken. Here, while flavourful, the meat contained bones and was a lower quality of chicken. The Tandori chicken was flavourful as well.....but no breasts (white meat) ...it, like the butter chicken, were thighs and drumsticks. The spiciest dish on the buffet were the pakora's, which was a surprise as the buffet also had the chick peas (which are usually a bit spicy, but here were rather bland). 

Unfortunately for us, the best part of the buffet was the naan bread...which is a staple at every Indian restaurant.

I recall a few years back coming across a drink I used to love as a kid and buying it and being hugely disappointed at how the memory of it was actually better than the real thing.......I felt that same feeling after eating here."}
{"text":"Having early dinner it kinda better to avoid crowded customer.  The food is testy but unfortunately the food is but cold. 
If you see view from Dixie Rd, you will not think that restaurant in there.  The place is running down but if you going around to the plaza  then you notice that in that place have a restaurant. 
Overall you must try this restaurant, it so rare I would suggest this thing."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had our engagement party in the banquet hall last week. We have had such an amazing experience with them and highly recommend the restaurant and the banquet halls. The owners and managers are very resourceful, we even chose our DJ upon their recommendation and were very impressed. The food and servers are excellent. The venue is beautiful. But above all the customer service is beyond compare. My fiance and I didn't really get a chance to eat to much during our event but the food looked so good that we went back the next day for lunch! We ordered a few dishes but the owners were so kind to offer us the buffet as well. In fact, when we tried to pay, they insisted the meal was on the house. They are such a huge institution but they still treat every customer so well. We will definitely be going back there for years."}
{"text":"I thought the food was amazing and service impeccable.  I love spicy Indian food and for some reason most places don't make it spicy enough but Bombay Palace is not one of those.  Highly recommend and look forward to going back"}
