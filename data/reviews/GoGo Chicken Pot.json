{"text":"Finally got a chance to try GoGo Chicken Pot and let me start by saying it was a very underwhelming and disappointing experience. To start off, the restaurant is an all you can eat restaurant where you start off with either the original chicken pot or the cheese pot followed by hot pot with chicken broth. As someone that loves eating chicken, all this place serves is chicken and even I was sick of it at the end. I made reservations for Sunday at 6:30pm and it was already busy.

Food 2/5
As I mentioned the food is generally all you can eat. You start off with the chicken pot where the food is already 80% cooked and finish it off on the heat. Pitchers of chicken broth are provided to thin out the sauce and that you don't burn the pot. Our party of four ordered two each of the original and the cheese pots and were quite disappointed by the taste. Original pot comes with skin on bone-in chicken in a soy sauce based with bits of chillies and green onions. The cheese on the other hand had an option of three types of cheese to choose (brie, provolone and blue) but the server first comes with a big bowl of questionable \"cheese sauce\" along with two sad slices of the chosen cheese. Our provolone was drowned out by whatever is in that bowl of processed cheese and was quite bland. The chicken in this bowl is a deep fried and comes with instant noodles. The cheese pot was quite disappointing and tasted grainy after a bit of cooking. At least the chicken was tender which made up for the lack of flavour. After the pot they add more broth for the hot pot where you can order sides of vegetables, fish balls, etc. The pots also come with a side of their chicken soup and/or steamed rice. Both were okay, soup was bland and the steamed rice was like the ones you get at dim sum.

Service 1.5/5
Wow service was almost non-existent. I'm not sure if the place is usually this packed but they only had a total of 5 servers for the entire restaurant. They barely came around to clear up the dishes which made eating uncomfortable when there was no room on the table. We had originally ordered the deluxe hot pot ($4.99 for other meats such as beef, pork, shrimp) but we were almost full after our first chicken pot. We spent a solid 10-15 minutes trying to wave down a server to void it but they never look around. When we finally managed to wave someone down he went to the computer to void it and comes back with our deluxe order. The meat was already melted and was clearly sitting out waiting for someone to take it out. 

All in all I have no plans on coming back. It was an okay experience but neither the service or food was remotely good enough. The restaurant opened recently and obviously has kinks to work out. If you were to try this place I'd recommend coming in a few months time."}
{"text":"Location/Service
The restaurant is in a small plaza along Bayview, south of Elgin Mills. They have a huge outdoor sign, so it's not difficult to miss. The plaza is a little small, so parking may get full during busy hours.

Interior has a theme of HK-style restaurants - lamps that were used at supermarkets and a very nice HK harbour overview. Seating arrangements can accommodate large groups - better call in for reservations to secure a spot.

Service was okay. I don't usually say much about service - but there are a few kinks that can be sorted out:
1. A logistic workflow would help smooth out who's doing what and which tables are they covering, I see everyone is scrambling all over
2. The main chef explained in detailed how the menu works, very nice of him. But it would help if other staff do this upfront, considering this is a 'new' thing and not everyone is familiar how it works
3. Younger staff could be a little more attentive on refilling water and placing in orders of food request (we had to ask multiple times with different people to get more vegetables)
4. Felt rushed with the older staff, who kept coming over wanting to add chicken broth to our pot when we were clearly not ready; and a bit hesitant on providing us more chicken orders - is there a time/quantity limit on how much chicken we can eat? 


Food
For those who are not familiar, basically this is all-you-can-eat chicken and hot pot. 

$29.99 per person - Original Chicken Pot (spicy, you can adjust from mild to extra hot)
$35.99 per person - Cheese Chicken Pot (swiss cheese flavor, additional cheese available for $4.99 - with options like brie/blue/provolone cheese) 

Pricing also comes with a complimentary soup and claypot rice - chicken themed as well

Original Chicken - pre-marinated flavouring with bones, tender meat
Cheese Chicken - fried chicken, crunchy outside and tender inside, no bones
Both are great selections!

You can re-order the chicken for extra rounds. After you're done, hotpot base soup (chicken broth for now) is added and then you can order hotpot AYCE items (pretty standard stuff).

Hotpot is a bit plain, although they do offer a deluxe option you can add that includes lobster wonton, deep fried bean curd and beef - but if you be creative on the items you order (i.e. instant noodle + cheese), it can be pretty good!


Overall, this is something new and worth to try. There are long wait times - so I might come back when it's less busy and more options are available"}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that the Hong Kong-style Chicken Pot is finally coming to Toronto and wanted to try badly. 

I made reservation for a large group a week after their grand opening. It took me two attempts before I could have my reservation confirmed. When I called in the afternoon, I was told that they would call back my number to confirm because they were very busy at the moment. It was odd that they could not take my reservation at that time. And of course, they didn't end up calling me back. So I had to make a second call. 

When our group arrived, we were promptly seated at a big round table. It's always nice to dine at a round table when you have a large group. I especially love the decor and all the hong kong style touches they put into the space. It was very nostalgic. But, all of us were a bit confused with how their menu/system works so the chef came to our table and explained everything to us. 

This is how this place works:
Everybody was charged a flat rate based on the 2 options that were available to us at the time (cheesy chicken pot $35.99 or original chicken pot $29.99). For the original chicken pot, you could customize level of spiciness. We were recommended by the chef to start with mild and increase spiciness with each refills. You basically get served \"unlimited\" chicken in their signature sauce inside a pot on the stove. After you're done eating with this cooking style, you could then ask for your pot to turn into a hot pot. The staff would pour in chicken broth and serve you AYCE items such as veggies, meat balls, corn, crab meat, wontons and some other basic hot pot food items. It was an interesting concept. With the pricing, each person also get served a bowl of hearty chicken soup and clay pot chicken rice. 

Here's what I found confusing, we were only served 2 clay pots rice that night to share between 8 of us. Whether the number of clay pots rice was determined by number of people or by table remained a mystery to me. 

The original chicken was marinated in their signature Mala Sichuan sauce and came bone-in. It was well seasoned, tender and flavourful. The cheesy chicken although was highly recommended by the chef, was a little bit disappointed for me. The cheesy sauce was bland. The crispy boneless chicken was soggy when served with the cheesy sauce. And since we had a huge group, we ordered both of these pots to try and actually found that both dishes balanced each other out quite nicely.

However, we got a little bit sick of eating the same taste over and over again after the 3rd or 4th refills. And the older lady manager made us feel a bit uncomfortable with the refills. To be honest, the portion that came with each pot was actually not enough to go around 8 people and we only had 2 pots to share among us. We ended ordering 6 refills for the original chicken pot and 3 refills for the cheesy pot. If you do the math, that was roughly one pot per person for $30+. So not sure why she was giving us a hard time if this was meant to be \"unlimited\". Anyway, when we turned them into hot pot, the flavours were quite bland. And even with the broth added to it, the taste was still the same. 

One of the drawbacks was the location. It was quite out of the way from central Markham. And both of their speed of service and ventilation need improvement. Quite a few people felt a slight discomfort from inhaling the chilli peppers in the air and had to cover their nose/mouth while dining.

I wasn't sure if I'd come back again unless they add more other flavours to the menu."}
{"text":"Went there last with a group of 9 people. The place was packed with people lining up, so service was a bit slow but thats fine since there was a lot of people and we had some drinks while we wait. The flavour of the chicken was amazing especially the spicy pot (if you can handle it, if not, just try the mild pot, just as good)."}
{"text":"Came here during weekday with friends. Chicken pot is one of my favourite dishes, it brings back a lot of memories when i had the chicken pot from Hong Kong.

 Also I'm a big fan of the spiciness, we can customize the spiciness level to your choice for the original chicken pot. The best part of this place is you can always ask to refill the chicken into your pot, its an AYCE concept. After you have done eating the chicken pot, you can enjoy your time having hot pot with many other choices of item! 

How amazing is the idea that you can enjoy hot pot after having enough the strong tastes of the chicken in one restaurant ! This place is highly recommended and I will definitely come back again with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Chicken was pretty good. We ordered the original and spicy pot. Great service. After couple of rounds you may want to start drinking water."}
{"text":"(wish I can give 0 stars) Worst service.... The staff don't know what they are doing. We waited 30 min with no food. 

Menu:
Many item crossed out. Crossed out original price (much cheaper). (I thought this place is new ?) 

Staff need more training for sure.

Soup:
It comes with chicken soup,but it's more like a MSG water

Chicken: 
Do not order : the cheese pot ($36pp)..It is expensive and the chicken are fried.

Regular chicken ($29 pp)pot was ok, but expect to wait 30+ min for refill. (After asking staff to check on order multiple times)

Winter melon drink: ($8.99/jar)
DO NOT ORDER : Ridiculous drink ever. They should named it \"syrup\" with little water.

Conclusion: I would not come back. :)"}
{"text":"GoGo Chicken Pot, the first and ever restaurant to serve sizzling Hong Kong style chicken pot to the Greater Toronto Area in an all-you-can-eat fashion.

You can order the chicken in different spicy level. If you can't eat spicy, don't worry, you can start with original. I find the medium spicy very good, with a good level of spice. The chicken was not dry at all, very smooth. The best part is after you are done with the chicken or while you want to switch over to hot pot, they give you a plate that consist of spinach, lettuce, assorted fish balls, daikon radish, rice noodles mushroom, and iced tofu. 

I like this concept of how you can switch from chicken pot to hot pot. The switch diversify the whole process and the flavour was good. The rice noodles and vermicelli soaks up the sauce nicely. I would actually give it 4.5 stars.

The ambiance, decor and music made me feel like I was back in Hong Kong. Actually, the decor reminds me a little of Big Mouth Kee. We have a friend visiting from Shanghai who is a good cook and foodie, she enjoyed the chicken too! I will definitely come back with other friends and the whole family!"}
{"text":"Food isn't very good and the service is bad. Our waitress forgot to give us cutlery and couldn't speak English. When we received our plates there was dried marks of food already on them. Strongly don't recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, very tasty chicken, however you're not receiving the $29 value that you pay.  For that price the only meat you get is chicken (lots of chicken bones) with a variety of vegetables and choice of noodles.  Great to try it once but won't be a regular."}
{"text":"Very interesting restaurant to go to. The light lamps that were used are ones that they used in the grocery market in Hong Kong.

The menu was confusing at the beginning since they didn't specify how the price was, per person or per order.

I love the unlimited order or chicken and hot pot food. 
It was very interesting, flavours were delicious. 

You first have the unlimited chicken pot then steam rice.

Lastly after being tired of chicken you can have veggies and carbs hot pot."}
{"text":"There was a big hype about this place so my family and I decided to 'chick-it out' haha. It smells really good in the restaurant! The down part of it smelling really good is that the smell stays on your clothes and hair afterwards. Service was good.

* ORIGINAL CHICKEN POT
It is all you can eat for the chicken and the assortment of some fish balls, frozen tofu, tofu, veggies etc. If you want to add beef / other meats, it's an additional $4.99. The chicken is precooked with some red peppers and spices. They provide you with some chicken broth to add to the pot as well.

Overall, I think the flavours were good but everything became overwhelmingly salty after a few rounds. We were all really really thirsty and ordered a few drinks."}
{"text":"The concept is nice. It's nice to try something different from regular hot pot. The decor is nice. You pay $30 per person for the chicken pot plus ayce sides, comes with a nice soup and not so special steamed chicken rice in pot. The soup is good. The chicken rice is not cooked in the pot. It's only chicken and some mushroom put inside the pot for presentation. I suggest they skip the rice and give me $5 off. The chicken for the main pot taste good but on the salty side. Once you moved on and add broth in the pot for hot pot cooking, the soup is kind of bland. May be it's because I didn't order the spicy chicken. But I can see it's lacking in flavour compare many other hot pot place. The sides the you can order is average quality and not much choices. I expected more for $30. Even if you add the $5, the choices are still way less than a regular hot pot place. At the end I decided to order ????instant noodle to fill myself up. Very disappointed that it's not the real Hong Kong instant noodle. And then no dessert??? What? Which ayce place has no dessert in GTA? They could have include one or two Hong Kong style dessert to gain some points. So anyway, this place is worth trying if you have never been here, but I probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food can be spicy enough if you ask for it, which is very rare in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here during the soft opening. I'm a fan of the spiciness that my original chicken pot came in -- the level of spiciness is customizable to your choice.

I've never experienced a hot pot concept like this before, so it was all exciting. If you've lived in Canada for most, if not all, your life like me and want to experience something new, this place has you covered.

You essentially get a pot of chicken and once you're done with that, you can switch it all into a hot pot, utilizing the chicken as broth. It's all seamless and you get to have the general AYCE hot pot items.

Honestly, after coming here, I don't see a reason why you'd go to another hot pot place unless the location is too far. The only negative thing I can peg on GoGo Chicken is their service, which I'm sure they're working on as they just opened."}
{"text":"To be fine This restaurant just open this week, is understandable that the wait time can be a little bit longer. I live in the neighborhood and I bring my Family and they love this place. I tried this type of hotpot in HongKong  it is authentic and the taste is great. 

The wait time is kind of long but the manager of the restaurant actually went to every table and explain the situation to us and give us free drinks and discounts. Since is soft opening I think is acceptable to be longer.

The Food is great everything is all you can eat  from chicken pot to hotpot. I personally love the Extra Spicy it taste awesome!

For sure going to come back with frdss."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 rounds of chicken! First round was mild which taste fine, the chicken was pretty juicy and soft.  When we asked for second round, they gave us spicy chicken accidentally. It was the Sichuan style spicy. I found that spicy chicken tasted better than the mild one. Order the spicy one if you can eat spicy. I found that it's too oily when switching to the hot pot as all the oil came from the Chicken pot. Also, I smelled like the chicken pot after as their ventilation was not that good."}
{"text":"I came here during their soft opening. The concept of having an AYCE chicken pot and then transforming the same pot into a hot pot is friggin' genius! The menu was a bit confusing in the beginning, but they have revised it and is now easier to understand.

Chicken pot was originated from Sichuan, China; hence you will taste the mala spice! It has gain popularity in Hong Kong and it has now become a cultural signature! There are over 250 restuarants in Hong Kong serving this type of cuisine. Now, the concept is finally here in Toronto, and the first in North America!

If you don't eat mala spicy, you can choose the level of spiciness for the Original chicken pot or try the Cheese chicken pot with popcorn chicken, which was my favourite! The meal also includes fresh, daily made chicken soup, and steamed chicken rice on the side. The rice takes 20 minutes, so make sure you ask them to put the order in as soon as you sit down! They did not include dessert the second time I was there, not sure how the dessert works - no harm to ask :)

The chicken pot and basic hot pot items are AYCE :) Once you have finished your pot of chicken, the server will fill the same pot with chicken broth and continue with the hot pot experience! If you want fresh sliced meats, and deep fried bean curd (my fave!), you can add $4.99 per person for the deluxe hot pot experience.

GoGo Chicken Pot (???) grand opened on March 26, 2018. It is now $29.99 pp for Original Chicken Pot, and $35.99 pp for Cheese Chicken Pot. Kids under 3 is free, under 10 is half price. The flow of the whole authentic experience is definitely something to work on. There are plenty of room for improvement, and I hope this restaurant will succeed :) Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place has 2 flavour of chicken pot. Original and cheese. I chose original and medium spicy and comes with pork skin and beef tripe, double boil soup and chicken pot rice and after some ordinary hot pot ingredients. 

- Double boil soup is not double boiled. Simply pour soup into a clay bowl. (At least heat up the bowl and make it seems like it's double boiled)
- chicken pot rice, rice not made in pot, chicken were so blended and I got serve with only 1 slice of shitaki mushroom lol. Soy sauce for rice was not made properly. Simple light soy and sugar. 
- chicken pot, very light in flavour, chicken not marinated long enough and chicken were actually fried.....definitely not Hong king style as they advertised. 

Also felt extremely thirty midway through my dinner. Perhaps add more real flavours instead of adding too much MSG.

However service was great, staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"First Hong Kong style chicken hot pot experience here in Toronto, didn't surprised me anything tbh, indeed it is similar to the one I tried in Hong Kong but it's a bit overpriced for acye hot pot...We ordered original chicken hot pot which is $29pp so we paid $145 for 4 people...with the same amount of money, I'd go for Korean or Japanese barbecue though 

Their service was the most disappointing thing in my overall experience. I guess it's the family running the whole business and the servers were in their mid 40s so they're kinda all over the place and forgot some of our orders. 

Even though this place is fairly new, there was only one option left on the menu out of two for the hot pot items so you don't really have a choice in choosing what to eat other than the flavour of the chicken 

We ordered the original flavour for the chicken, you can choose with spicy or with cheese which are more expensive of course. The chicken itself was average cuz it's a bit too sweet to me personally. They gave us soup and steamed chicken rice before the chicken. The soup takes like MSG but the streamed chicken rice is actually pretty good, the soy sauce wasn't too salty and it has enough chicken breast in it.

Will I ever go again?? Mayyyybe, but will not be soon or often for sure!!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday. EXTREMELY pricy. Not only did they not give a bday discount (most restaurants would), the chicken was mainly bones (not too much meat). Pop was $3.50 each. Atmosphere and servers ok. Would never recommend this place. It was a one time try."}
{"text":"First time at GOGO chicken pot! 
Busy restaurant . 
Chicken pots are delicious. Me and my friends enjoyed it thoroughly . 
Had the spicy chicken pot which was very appetizing. The regular chicken for those who can't handle the spices and the boneless cheese chicken bites! 
After the chicken is done, you get to use the pot as a hot pot with the sauce base. One of a kind for sure ! They'll then bring your the hot pot ingredients (meat, fish balls, veggies, noodles, tofu, etc) 

Service wise, they're a very busy place. 
They did their best to make sure we got everything we needed. 
So we are very grateful! 

In all, it was an enjoyable experience. Amazing food! I'd definitely come back ."}
{"text":"Went with 4 ppl and sat down for awhile. It's a all you can eat chicken place. Cheapest price is $29 per person. Issue is that it's all you can eat One item. You get tired of eating the same greasy chicken bones.
Tastes is good but nothing special. I don't think it's good value when a place like a regular chinese buffet is same price.

New place and so some staff didn't know what the items were supposed to come with the buffet.
One Rice bowl between 4 came after we noticed other tables had rice instead of telling us it's included.
Veggies hot pot came at the end when you are tired of eating same chicken taste.

I wouldn't come again. Good to try though.
Probably needs to add more side items so you don't get bored with just one chicken"}
{"text":"Went there second time because My friend want to try it. We are 4 Ppl, In the end Total is $200+???  $100 for a lemon tea??  WTF????? Over price all u can and over price tea????UNBELIEVABLE"}
{"text":"I love the idea of chicken pot, and the decoration of the store is very nice. However, I think this is way too pricy and the food is not worth it. so the basic is $30 and with cheese $5 extra per person. and if you wanna add beef $5 extra again. I got the cheese one, and I would not recommend. It's too much and the cheese will sink and solidify after awhile. you can add cheese half way through, and if you don't it tastes super plain. 
We started with the soup and chicken rice which was pretty good, but I recommend one rice for two to three people, or else you will be full without even starting the hot pot (it's a big bowl of rice). Then they added instant noodles in the cheesy chicken  hotpot, which I don't like it. Then you can start adding like a regular hot pot. It will be all veggies if you didn't add $5. To be honestly the food is fresh and good quality. 
You need to pay extra for drinks, around $3 per glass bottle of coke. 
Overall we spent around $50 per person. great experience hopefully they can improve with the soup base and instant noodles part. Would try the original version if I will come again. (Probably not unless improvement)"}
