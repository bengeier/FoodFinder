{"text":"Cozy atmosphere with friendly, attentive  service. The food seems traditional but is mediocre at best. The chicken was dry, the salad was soggy. The naan was quite good. With all the great Indian places in Toronto I doubt I'd ever go back."}
{"text":"First off, I absolutely love Indian food and have had the opportunity to eat some amazing homecooked indian food with friends.  I came here twice, once for lunch, a second time for dinner (as I'm writing this review).  The atmosphere is cozy and this is quite a small place, though there is a small patio as well.  Lunch here is decent, nothing great, but certainly a place I expect to come to again for lunch.  Dinner is on the other hand, quite great.  I'm having the assorted tandoori and am loving everything.  Portion isn't too big, but I'm getting totally full.  Price is reasonable, and this is NOT a buffet.  I'd recommend this place if you're in the area and in the mood for something spicy."}
{"text":"My first meal in Toronto is here. This place didn't do me wrong, it was good! The owner was there so he talked to us. Pretty decorations and the price weren't too expensive. This is situated in Korean Town of toronto."}
{"text":"It's not bad.... but it's not really good either.  This is a little Indian place on the edge of the Korean district.  Decoratively it's in the  \"standard '70's faux-authentic not in India could be anywhere\" style.  Their lunch deal is very reasonably priced and it's not Korean, which is handy in this part of town if you're all kimchi'd out.  Their dahl soup is a little sour but edible, otherwise it is mostly forgettable.  Eat here if you are hunbgry and walking past, but don't make a special visit of it."}
