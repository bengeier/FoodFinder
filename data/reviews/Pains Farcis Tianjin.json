{"text":"First time in my life to not finish my lunch, the buns were still cold in the midle and the soup is juste plain water no taste at all. We juste ask to pay and leave. What a waste of money and time. I felt like i was in a episode of kitchen nightmares."}
{"text":"This place is really authentic for the food from north China! At first I was doubting because of not so high Yelp review.  We had such a satisfied lunch. Wish they can sell bao zi individually instead of an order of 10."}
{"text":"Food is just... not flavorful, not good. I'm referring to everything - soup (tastes like carpet. No salt, no spice, no nothing - except a bad smell), appetizers have very mild flavor and are cooked simple, buns are not good enough to justify coming here. No hot sauce available either. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fancy food, great service and ambiance, don't come here. However, the food is actually pretty good and authentic for Northern Chinese cuisine. 

I usually get takeout and it's a nice, simple, filling meal. The food tastes homemade which is a bonus for me."}
{"text":"Amazing Soup Pork buns!!!!! *THE END* 

Hahaha just kidding! But really, I would come back JUST for their soup dumplings. I have had them in NYC and these are pretty close. I have been looking for these for a very long time. 

The place is a small restaurant on the second floor. Of course it's nothing fancy but the food is worth it. The prices are great!!!! 

Be prepared to wait a good amount of time for your dumplings / buns to be prepared. But remember, they are being made fresh to order!!!! It is worth the wait. 

If you like your buns with the soy / ginger vinaigrette use the bottle with the label that says 6°. I posted a picture. This truly adds to the final taste of the bun! 

Over all - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you want yummy yummy dumplings where the first bite fills your mouth with succulent juices, this is NOT the place.

I've been duped. Only after eating here did I realize the poster downstairs was just a fancy poster and not an accurate reflection of the food!

This place serves buns and dumplings northern Chinese style. The steamed 'dragon' buns are fluffy, which is similar to the dough from a BBQ pork bun from a dim sum place. If you've lived in Northern China, maybe this will taste like home, but this place is nothing like Ding Tai Fung, which serve probably the best 'little dragon' paos in the world.

The tea looked a bit doggy, so I used it to rinse my chopsticks. I ordered both the steamed dumplings and the fried dumplings. They were both made from the same filling. See photos. Steamed dumplings are supposed to be a bit juicy inside, so the filling is supposed to be more fatty or filled with some glutinous broth before steaming. These buns did not have it.

The fried dumplings were not fried evenly. They are supposed to be a crispy golden brown throughout, but the ones served were uneven. Big disappointment.

With that said, they seem to have a regular clientele of Chinese from the north (I could tell by the accents). Maybe because the food here reminds them of home.

But if you're looking for yummy dumplings, don't come here. I don't know how this place can stay open much longer....

This place got two stars because my friend from London happens to like it. (He was really really hungry). I would really try one of the other dumpling places instead."}
{"text":"$2 ???(millet congee thing) comes with refills so it is pretty amazing. 

The set meals are pretty good value as well. 

Buns are the best i've found in montreal so far. 

Remember to use the spicy oil and black vinegar to season the cold plates and buns. 

Wontons are delicious as they use sesame oil to enhance the aroma. 

Service is kinda like a self-serve thing. So don't hold yourself back from grabbing spoons, chopstick, napkins from wherever u find them. No one really comes here for the service anyways so you can forget about it."}
{"text":"I sort of understand why people gave this place poor reviews - China is big. If you are from the southern China and think steamed buns should taste like Shanghai soup bun - the very juicy one, then don't come to this place. If you are from the north of China, I guarantee that you will find the vintage, authentic Chinese flavor that hard to find anywhere else in North American (even in Flushing of New York). 

I grew up in Beijing. When I was little, the scallion pork steamed bun was one of the most popular local food, especially for breakfast and dinner, together with Chinese salad, millet congee, pickles, and tea eggs... It was a very simple, inexpensive, but healthy and tasty Chinese diet for everyone at that time. Now, China has been exploded with urbanization everywhere and this kind of simple and healthy diet faded away as well. Now, local Beijing residents go to a restaurant there called Yaoji for authentic scallion pork steamed buns and it is the only place. I have to say, the steamed buns I had at this restaurant in Montreal was even better than the buns that I can find at Yaoji in Beijing, the flavor is just closer to the tastes I had in 1980s China. It was truly a pleasant surprise to connect to childhood flavors on the other side of the planet. 

As I said, China is big and there is no single taste can satisfy all Chinese. So I don't recommend this place for everyone. But if you are also from the north, especially Beijing, Tianjin, northeastern region, you may know that kind of vintage flavor I am talking about."}
{"text":"This place looks like authentic for the steam bun....but inside of the restaurant was dirty...and not busy at all....I tried the steam bun with pork...it taste too mush sesame oil and too salty for me...."}
{"text":"Ooof.  Walked up a few flights of stairs with posters of buns and bubble tea.  Place was empty.
I ordered the \"trial\" of buns, soup and salad; figured I can't go wrong.
Waitress only speaks french, but the menu is also in English.  My date translated. 
I tried to order a bubble tea, but the waitress said \"no\".  I was confused after seeing all the posters for Bubble Tea.
 I tried to order a \"Pepsi\", she also said \"no\".  I did see 3 cases of Pepsi cans on the floor next to the front counter....???
We received warm tap water, no ice.
At that point other people had arrived and had brought their own beverages. 
The soup was a rice porridge; no substitutions I was told.  It was so BLAND, desperately needed salt but the waitress said NOT to put any vinegar or hot oil in it (the only condiments). Weird she knew the soup needed to be altered. I took two sad sips.
The nori salad was my own risk; I wasn't into the texture but the spicy sesame sauce was okay, I had one bite.
The buns were also bland and way more bun than meat and at that point I was so bummed out I ate two and left.  
I'm sure China town has more to offer."}
{"text":"My lover gave the ambience a D and was upset that the server didn't think she \"looked\" Chinese. She also thought the dumplings were sub-par: skin too tough, meat not tasty enough, etc. I thought they were fine but wished we would have ordered the excellently named \"homely irrigation soup bun\"."}
{"text":"I had been craving XLBs (xiao long baos, or soup dumplings) for about a month now (a.k.a. since I arrived in Montreal, \"You can take the girl out of Asia, but...\") and today I just happened to have the time to humour that craving just a little bit. Honestly, when I set foot in Chinatown (which is more like a block-radius than a town, sadly) I just eyeballed a few places (most of which were closed) before zeroing in on Pains Farcis. It was 3:30 in the afternoon so the staff (two old ladies and one old man) were eating their lunch, but all of them were quite friendly when I walked in--I had the whole place to myself, by the way. The man was the one who ended yo serving me and he was very sweet. Unfortunately, the food was so sub-par, I almost feel guilty writing this review but the XLBs (pork and leek) were more bao than the thin-skinned, soup-filled, fragrant dumplings I was expecting from the photos and my memories of Din Tai Fung back in Asia. But they were at least more flavourful than the bland soup and salad that came out with the combo I ordered...soup with rice that was more like boiled grains sitting in water, plus a tofu salad that made me feel like I was eating rubber bands...had to douse them in vinegar and chilli oil to trick my mind into thinking I was eating actual food. It would be fine if I was drunk and still in university (for the price) but sadly, neither were the case today."}
{"text":"The buns/dumplings/wontons here is average here. There is numerous of dumpling restaurants in Montreal's Chinatown but I so happened to try this one out. 

Very minimum services (order and pay at the cashier). The food comes out pretty quick and the steam buns are not bad but I definitely had better. The buns are best eaten when it is hot/warm. They have a few of traditional Northern soups like Millet porridge(???). The wonton soup is okay. Would recommend if you want something quick or if you are are feeling buns or dumplings."}
{"text":"My husband & I decided it would be fun to do a \"dumpling hop\" in Chinatown, Montréal while here for the F1 Grand Prix. The 3 restaurants we randomly dropped into while walking down Chinatown: Restaurant Noodle Factory, Restaurant Pain Farci, and Qing Hua. We only ordered their juicy pork dumplings at each place.

Restaurant Noodle Factory -  4 stars. The 6 dumplings weren't very juicy but they were tasty and I really enjoyed their sweet dipping sauce. Worth the $10 price tag. 

Restaurant Pain Farci -  4 stars. The dumplings here were super soupy, flavorful, and ginormous, hence the $13/$14 price tag for 10 pieces.

Qing Hua =  1 star. The worst dumplings we've ever tasted...unless you like tons of extra hard dough with your dry dumplings. I would caution anyone from going there. Boo! Thumbs way down 

NOTE: We've been to a few Din Tai Fung restaurants in Singapore, Japan and southern California so we have something to compare the dumplings to."}
{"text":"Stay away, many other options literally on all four corners.
Price - 2/5 (two orders of dumplings and a coke = $28!)
Food - 2/5 not terrible but not memorable
Service - 1/5 (slow... come hungry if you decide to go at all)
Decor - 1/5"}
{"text":"Are the buns good? Yes. Is the service bad? Yes. We waited a while to place our order and there were no napkins or bowls for vinegar when the food came a while later. Very low key but good for an unpretentious dinner."}
{"text":"I walked in front of this joint quite a few times but never got to try it out. After reading the split reviews, I decided to test it with a friend. We went in on a Tuesday afternoon and the restaurant was empty. I got an order of cilandro/pork small bun (10 pieces) @ 9$ flat and a side dish of sliced cold tofu skin. The buns were steaming hot and the doe felt like marshmallow. Contrary to southern Xian long back  or soup dumpling, the northern style has fluffy skin wit no soup. Im front Beijing and this what I ate going up. The filling was well seasoned and not too oily. The side dish had a weird taste of preservative and the texture was soft instead of chewy. Overall, great discovery!"}
{"text":"Apparently it used to be a bubbletea place and thank god it's not one any more... Really love the steamed buns because they taste soooo good! Those who are looking for xiaolongbao kind of steam bun, go to other restaurants, this restaurant serves amazing flour-made buns instead of soup-filled buns so stop complaining that their buns are not authentic. I find the other dishes (salad, side dish, drinks) so-so, but I would come back again and again for the steamed buns."}
{"text":"Considering their rating was pretty poor I still gave it a shot!!!
I am a dumpling guy and I know my dumplings. Where ever I see Xiao long bao I have to try. And here they had the pork and was not sure what to expect. But what a surprise. These were the best pork I have tried in Montreal. Toronto is still No.1 but for montreal I can't complain. The veggie steamed buns were also very good and authentic tasting along with all the cold dishes. 
Over all a nice surprise as I expected nothing special.
Place needs a facelift and should be a little cleaner. minus one star for that."}
{"text":"We stopped here because my sister had a craving for soup dumplings. It was my first time trying them and I was not disappointed! Staff was super friendly too. :)"}
