{"text":"Make sure that you are well dressed when you shop here or they won't serve you. The employees here feel very entitled and forget who they are serving. It's quite amusing. I prefer the Yorkdale location better"}
{"text":"Yes Holt Renfrew is expensive.  There is absolutely no getting around that but it is still tons of fun.  I do think in order to enjoy HR you have to have an interest in the mainstream fashion industry, meaning, you are familiar with the major lux brands and don't feel like discussing whether or not they are worth the price.  If you read Vogue, In Style, Elle, etc it is really neat to see the cloths up close that you see in the pages of magazines.  I do think the Bloor Street location is an excellent store with friendly staff and an amazing merch selection.  Yes I said friendly staff.  Having visited all 3 Holt Renfrew's in Toronto as well as the one in Ottawa I find the Bloor Street location to have the friendliest staff and if you genuinely are interested in the products, and not just if you would like to purchase them, then they are helpful.  I have had many experiences in the jewelery department where the sales person will show me something clearly out of my price range just because it is a gorgeous piece.     The first floor of Holt Renfrew is handbags, accessories and cosmetics.  I think it also has mens wear but I don't bother with that area.  The handbag area is fan-friggin-tastic!!  During sales time there are tables of bags that are on sale.  On boxing day, these tables are crazy and my sister and I totally enjoy seeing women searching for that perfect bag, or in some cases 3, that they are looking for.  It is crazy boxing day mayhem and that is how we like to spend our boxing day holiday.  For people who love cosmetics this is where you can find brands like Perspectives, Yves St Laurent, Dior, Bobbie Brown, Chanel, etc and I know people who think the cosmetic department is heaven.   The shoes, coats, lingerie and caf√© can be found on a 1.5 floor on the east side of the shop.  It is a very sweet mid floor between the first and second that can eat up a lot of your browsing time.  Checking out crazy shoes is fun, that cannot be argued.   The second floor is the high end brands like Chanel, Gucci, etc.  The items are beautiful but sooo do not fit my budget and lifestyle that I don't spend much time here.  Story time... my friend from Ottawa came up with her 8 year old.  The Chanel sales lady sees the 8 year old and asks her if she would like treat.  She gives her a Chanel shopping bag, catalog and Chanel ribbon.  The young 8 year old carried it all day on Bloor Street feeling like a grown up.     The third floor is where we might find something we love and maybe afford.  It house the contemporary labels like Marc by Marc Jacobs, See by Chloe, Theory, Teenflo, Catherine Maldandrino, Missoni, Tory Burch, Burrburry, Pink Tarten, DVF as well as the fully stocked denim department.  On this floor a change room is never far and  you can spend a lot of time checking out the latest arrivals as well as combing the sales racks.    Keep in mind Holt Renfrew does have sales, the end of Summer and Winter sales do give up to 75-80% off.  I have noticed that since this recession has hit that the sales are longer and better."}
{"text":"Wow! I used to go to this location often. I had thought the customer service had improved over the years (not as snobby, ignoring your presence, the look over!). Well it appears customer service has gone down again. Not sure if senior management has changed and it is not a priority??   Recent visit - no one saying hello, asking for help. In the Theory section - at least three girls talking - nothing, no acknowledgement. Well when I finally reached the jeans section - finally got a hello.   Cosmetics section - looking at make-up for a brand that is not widely available. Seriously a bunch of girls just chatting and not asking if I need help (at a make-up counter!!). I swatched myself and though I wanted to buy something that is hard to find - I didn't want to give Holts my business. I was not dressed in my suit that day or had done my hair. I was running errands, gym etc. - boy was I meant to feel worthless here. Had I got good service probably would have picked up new work pants from Theory (a favourite brand of mine) and that make-up product. Can't wait till Nordstrom hits Toronto and online shopping for hard to find with just be my best friend again. Theory is also available at the Bay!"}
{"text":"its only getting a 3 because other stores are even worse. this used to be great, i've been throwing cash here since my mid teens. now i struggle to find anything i'd like to buy and yes, staffing is an issue. come on holts, pick it up..."}
{"text":"I only shop in the menswear department, so I cannot comment on the entire store. What I would say about Holts in general- decent, but definitely not a \"wow\" retail experience. First off, I find the staff in general to be very uptight. They create ZERO excitement, and their customer service lacks even the basics. I feel like they are doing me a favour when I am there and ask for something, and I wonder who's idea or concept this is. Obviously management and senior management either think it is acceptable or maybe even encourage it? Either way, I would do a lot more shopping if the staff was more customer service based. Being self absorbed and having a huge attitude problem just isn't cool, and why these people get hired in a service based industry just doesn't make sense to me. Instead of Holts calling consulting agencies and marketing firms to boost sales- why not just try a simple experiment? For two seasons ask the retail staff to really be really courteous to every person who walks into the store. Tell them not to pre-judge anyone and  whether they can afford the product- just be sincerely focused in providing an easy retail experience. If sales are flat after the two seaons- go back to the current system of looking down at people and pretending to be better than them because the sweater you are selling costs $399 instead of $39. No harm done, no expense incurred.  If you want exceptional customer service, feel free to visit retailers like Neiman Marcus & Bloomingdale's. If you want the best prices, check out the stuff at Holts, then go online to any American high end retailer (yes they ship to Canada), and get the product for a lot less. That's why I always smile when I walk in Holts, the staff think they are so cool- I just try on what I like- then order it from Neiman Marcus or Saks on-line. Only if the Weston's knew how much money was being lost."}
{"text":"Love the british lady here who always helps me. She is great and helps me decide on what to buy. Their service is way better then the independent stores on Bloor. The service is great and even when things are busy they find time to help you !"}
{"text":"legit never been served entering this establishment, pretty crap service compared to harry rosen. The people within the men's department are the scum of the earth they don't offer any help, when I went to get my father a wallet from gucci, the person asked me could I even afford this and was reluctant to serve.  2 stars only for having the latest fashions"}
{"text":"The employees here decide whether or not to give you service purely based on how you are dressed and your age. Hell, if I opened up a store, I'd tell the employees to even serve the ones dressed in pyjamas because customer service is king. Besides, salespeople don't have x-ray visions to see whether or not you have a black Amex card. Anyway...  HR has all the brands you'd expect to see, like Brunello Cucinelli and Salvatore Ferragamo. Since we all know what to expect, I'll address the state of the sales around Christmas.  If you look at what's being sold at a discount, you'll quickly see that they are not worth buying, despite the Prada label.   Don't be fooled - all the good stuff is always at full price with a mark-up. You'll occasionally see brand name stuff on sale (to trick those individuals who purchase by brand only), but I personally try to avoid all that by going to Harry Rosen or Brooks Brothers. Or have it tailored."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, especially when the service is below average, but I experienced today the most deceiving customer experience ever.   When you shop at Holt, let alone at Burberry you expect a great customer service. You definitely want to leave the store with a great memory especial after spending 4 digits on an item. I guess it wasn't the case today.  I bought a coat couple of weeks ago and came to pick it up today. It didn't take me long to notice that the whole Burberry store at Holt was at 20% off.  Obviously, and like any normal customer,  I expressed my disappointment in not being able to benefit from their discount.  The sales rep. showed some compassion and offered to ask her manager whether it was possible to credit me the difference. The answer was no... Needless to say that I was disappointed and didn't hesitate in expressing it. The sales rep offered to speak again to the manager without success. The annoying part wasn't that they didn't offer to reimburse me, it was more having the manager facing me and not bothering to acknowledge me or apologize.   For someone who is fan of the brand and owns many many items, I was obviously disgusted.  I don't feel like wearing my new coat or any item I own from this brand.  For a brand that raves about British excellence, finesse and etiquette, they miserably failed at providing any of the above. Holt is better off having their own sales reps. in their Burberry boutiques.    I definitely regret this last purchase, I would never step a foot in any Burberry store again!!"}
{"text":"horrible service! The white female staff at YSL yesterday gave me the most disgusting attitude. Employees represent the reputation and the image of Holt Renfrew,but to display such a lack of public manner... I don't think I will come here again."}
{"text":"Oh Holt Renfew, you cruel, vicious lover you.  My love/hate for this place is out of control. I love the designer clothes I can't afford, I hate the snooty makeup counter girls. I love having an all-Canadian upscale mall with all the trappings of Neimum Marcus and Bergdorff's in the States. I hate that it can sometimes seem dated and a little cheap in that they seem to cut corners.  i love the holiday gift-wrapping service, I hate the price hike for nothing more than it being a Holt Renfrew product.  Ah, but Holt's in the winter, the Christmas shopping, the music, the cozy lighting, the cashmere as far as the eye can see. Even if it's just a $20 candle you can afford, it's about the shopping experience."}
{"text":"Do any of you have an acquaintance with whom every visit leaves you feeling like sh*t? Your leave feeling drained, dejected, maybe a little insecure or defeated. You vow you are done with them but keep going back, until one day you finally decide, once and for all, ENOUGH.  That sums up how I think and what I feel about Holt Renfrew on Bloor St.  Every time I walk out of their doors, I feel like crap. I feel unworthy by a set of standards to which I don't even subscribe. That's a pretty normal feeling after 3 floors of staff have acted like you don't exist.  There are 3 kinds of bad customer service: harassing the customer, being rude to the customer, and ignoring the customer. You can bargain on the latter two at Holts on Bloor. If you are a woman who hopes to be served at Holts, you may wish to bring one of the following things, to improve your chances of being noticed: 1) a man 2.5x your age 2) a completely perfect salon blowout 3) facial cosmetic surgery and a full face of makeup 4) designer clothes, top to toe. Preferably covered in logos.  Today I wandered into Holts. I was prepared to spend quite a lot of money; I wanted to reward myself for a big accomplishment. After testing out products and checking out garments under the sneers of hyper-groomed shopgirls and shopboys, though, I walked out with wallet intact. That familiar dejected, insecure, and defeated feeling was creeping back in.  I went home and went online to purchase everything I'd been ready to buy at Holts, plus a few things to reward me for my shitty experience.  ENOUGH. I'll take my money either 1) where I'm treated with some value or 2) where it's an Internet screen giving the silent treatment, not snobby staff."}
{"text":"This review is only about the Chanel located inside HR. Absolutely atrocious customer service. The sales associate I spoke to was in her late 20's (older than myself) but had a ridiculous attitude - almost completely looking down on me for walking into the store.   I was looking at a pink chevron boy bag from s/s pre-collection. I simply asked her if it was calfskin or lambskin which she immediately snared back that it was lamb. Once I touched the bag I immediately knew she was wrong as the bag was very tough/textured. At the time I was carrying a black lambskin boy and I could easily tell the difference. When I asked if she was sure, she rolled her eyes. I tried the bag on but wasn't quite sold on the chevron so I asked what colours, if any, were available in quilted. She said a large size in white and I immediately said no (way too big in size and I stay away from white due to colour transfer) - so of course she ignored what I said and brought it out because it's a bag that she likes herself.   I should have known to walk away by now but since I went in for a key holder I proceeded to ask her about that or if any other SLG's were available. She looked at me as if I had committed some blasphemous crime stating that \"we don't buy slg's here maybe try Yorkdale because they have more basic pieces like that.\" Excuse me? Not only was this SA lacking in basic knowledge of the products, she didn't listen/care about what I was interested in and even went as far as being condescending about my requests.   TL;DR - SA was a useless sack of flesh that acts entitled yet probably can't afford much of the merchandise herself. Bye Felicia."}

We had so so much fun that, when a few months later I came back to buy more exquisite for my work colleagues she remembered me and so I waited for her to assist me and she even got some amazing personalized engraving for my partner for Xmas on the bottle of the JO Malone perfume.  Just stunning! He other salesperson Mark, and also their supervisor where very attentive as well.  A sweet nice experience to remember us all how much a little bit of human touch is needed during our money spending!"}
{"text":"It is sad that one of my favorite brands is DVF and the only place in Toronto that regularly stocks DVF is Holts. Is it just me that thinks the employees and decor are unnecessarily uptight/ stuffy? Department stores of the same caliber in the US (Bloomies, Barneys, Saks, Neiman) are a lot more fun and creative. Plus Bloomies always have sales of designer products - no matter what time of the year it is - unlike Holts. Meh."}

{"text":"I have always received good service at their Chanel Boutique. They treat You like a fellow human and politely answer your questions about the products and what they have in stock, irrespective of how you look or how you are dressed in that moment.  To shop in the rest of the Holts Renfrew store, I recommend that You dress up in your best, and if you have a nice, high end, branded something - carry that. The reason for that is that the sales associates tend to conserve their energy and cater only to people who according to their 2 second calculation are more likely to make a purchase. Their Strategy of evaluating your wallet based on your current attire is not the best. But it is what it is. And I think its better to know how to make it work for you, in your favour. I remember one day I was shopping in the bloor street area and I went to their store after spending some time shopping at other stores. I was carrying a Louis Vuitton Shopping bag and a Chanel Shopping bag. I went all around their store, saw a few items, tried on a watch, tried a few perfumes, I got good service everywhere. However, as the evening progressed, I felt like I was ready to call it a day and go home. So I just sat down for a few moments on a chair nearby on the main floor. While I was sitting there, this sales associate from the store showed up with some samples. He insisted that I try this on his counter and that I am going to love it. I told him that I don't want to waste his time, I am really tired and I am not going to be buying anything today and maybe I will try it some other day. He asked me to wait for just a moment, he ran back to his counter, got a tester, insisted that I spary it on my arm. He said something along the lines that women with sophisticated taste such as mine deserve the best.  It was a really good fragrance and I liked it. But It  was a super pricey perfume (approximately $500 with taxes for 100 mL). He wanted me to buy it but I told him that I had made it clear, that not today. So he smiled and then he wrote down the name of that bottle on a card with his info and gave to my husband saying if he ever wants to give me a gift, this can be something to think about because this is what will truly be the best on me. Now, I did not even ask for this product, I did not know about this product, I did not even get up from my chair. All this fancy VIP service because he saw two high end, branded shopping bags in My hand and  looking at them, this sales guy came to a conclusion that I could afford it, even though I made it clear to him in words that I will not buy his product. I have been there again without the shopping bags and I can say I am always reminded of what those bags can do for you. So please, put your best foot forward and recieve the best service possible out there, because it is possible. You just need to know how and now You know."}
{"text":"This is a review of both the store and the afternoon tea  Sales staff were actually very helpful to my 76 year old mother who isn't certainly not rich. Kudos to the girl at the YSL cosmetic counter who was very sweet to my Mum who spent all of $55. Also to the girl on the top floor who personally escorted us to the scarves. We didn't have any snooty staff and the outfit I was wearing probably cost less than $100.  The afternoon tea was DISMAL. I have no idea why it is so hard to find decent afternoon tea in Toronto. The scones were small, dense and chewy. Tiny, flavourless sandwiches. The desserts were all chocolate (yes love chocolate but!) should be SOME variety. I do not recommend this at all."}
{"text":"I wanted to treat myself to a new purse so I went into Holt's two times this week to check out their selection of Marc Jacobs bags.   I can afford to buy the occasional item from Holts - what I can't afford is to waste my time in a store that seems to judge me on the way I look.  As I was riding up the escalator from the concourse level a group of employees were standing around talking. I think they were supposed to be handing out perfume samples but all they did was stare at me up and down. Did they smile? No. Did they ask if I needed anything? No. They simply stared me down then went back to their conversation.  In the purse section there was also large amount of employees - doing nothing.  A couple of them stared at me and it seemed as if they were wondering whether they should actually waste their time approaching me.  They didn't.  I had to approach one lady to ask for help but she was not exactly forthcoming with information about the bag I was interested in.     I found a great Marc Jacobs bag that was actually on sale which I bought. So yes I think Holt's has a great selection but does that mean I have to suffer through their terrible customer service?  When I'm in Manhattan I do a lot of shopping in Saks - they have a better selection without the attitude.      Holt's has a great selection of items and for certain lines, Holts is probably the only place in Canada where you can buy them.   But their staff needs to lose the attitude."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Probably the worst in North America!"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Holt Renfrew.  + I love that they have well designed, refined, trendy pieces of clothing and smaller sizes for men.  - I hate pricing on certain items however! For example, a hundred bucks or more on a ordinary graphic tee.  Please!  You know what I hate even more?  Shopping for a puff jacket.  At HR, there is a great selection of scaled down, slim fitted puff jackets and coats.  Yes, they are more pricey than other places.  But If it doesn't make me look like a Michelin Man, or worse, a Michelin Man wearing an inflated bath rope, wrap that baby up!  In term of service, it's pretty generic; the usual meet and greet and allowing you to browse peacefully.  Sale representatives are young, friendly, knowledgable and well trained.  An awesome service I recently discovered:  if Toronto HR doesn't have the size you're looking for, they'll track it down from other locations and have it transferred to Toronto location.  Now, that's cool!"}

But to my surprise i got a very cold and not even helpfull young woman which i think is very unfair if you work in a beauty section since is the area you should always motivate your costumers and make them happy specially for the money we spent in this small luxuries . Came to me simply said YES! With a fake smile i told her what i need she found it, throw it in a bag , got my money and send me off with a rush which i feel is very unprofessional . Never going back to the chanel beauty counter at holts bloor instead i rather go to the Yorkdale HR or Hudsons Bay for next purchaces."}

Can't wait until Nordstrom arrives, your ass will be so handed to you."}
{"text":"I come here maybe two to three times a year, and usually because I want to buy a lavish gift for my dear mother.   It's not worth it for me to purchase anything for myself here because I lose things way too often.. le sigh. However, when I shop here, the staff is usually very courteous and helpful. They're very knowledgeable in the clothing department, but in the cosmetic department the lady working at La Prairie had no clue what she was talking about, bringing me a totally different cream from what I asked for. She was also very slow - taking her time, searching through drawers and ended up having to ask her coworkers where things were located (I guess she was new). Her coworkers didn't really help her.. I'm guessing because they don't get the sales commission?   Oh well, aside from the service, you can pretty much find any brand name you want here.   Tip: Strangely, I've heard this Holt Renfrew actually prices certain items lower than the one in Yorkdale Mall."}
{"text":"I don't come here often, but I do when I want to try on expensive hand creams and relax in a great atmosphere. The Jo Malone fragrances are heavenly (ask for samples!) and the clothes are just so pretty, especially DvF wrap dresses that I can't afford and promise myself that one day I shall own one.  I went here to buy some jeans because I tried on H&M, F21, Gap and all the other cheap culprits for skinny jeans I could find. Those pants just DO NOT fit on me. I have a very stick straight body with a high, but slim waist. Cheap jeans are usually way too big in the waist if they fit in the legs, and/or too low-rise (ick...)  My body is just made for premium denim (alas) although I loathe paying the price. I'd rather spend $170 on great denim than $30 on something I hate to wear.  I went through their Boxing Day Sales Rack, picked out 50 jeans and narrowed it down to 2. I ended up buying the Citizens for $170 (OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!) but I love them because they're perfect for my body (high waisted works on me to stay on my body and not slide down), and a second pair, which I later returned.  My only reason for not giving a full 5 stars is because the saleslady there was both aggressive and snotty. I was asked my opinion in the dressing room by the saleswoman about another woman trying on jeans.  This poor woman had a fabulous body but in True Religion jeans, her butt looked flat, long and very strange. She said she usually has the opposite problem (perky, big butt which I did not see on her to be brutally honest).   The saleswoman was trying to make her commission by lying to this poor lady, and when they asked me to weigh in, I gave her my honest opinion and told her to put them back on the rack as they were unflattering.   I got the evil eye stare from the saleslady, but a grateful ' THANK YOU' from the lovely woman after that, but hey... don't ask me if you don't want me to dish out honesty to your clients.   I saved that lady $300 and a flat butt look.  At the counter, when I was holding 2 pairs of jeans, she gave me another attitude problem when I couldn't figure out which one I wanted. She wasn't as nice and was LAZY in trying to help me find 26, 27 or 28 sizes of jeans in skinny styles on the rack (okay, so she didn't even try to help, which made it worse because there was NO ONE ELSE THERE).  She also tried to tell me that $170 was CHEAP for the jeans, (2 for the price of one!) to get me to buy both of them, but who is she kidding? These jacked up Canadian prices at $270 - $300 each mean that in the U.S. these fake \"sales\" of 60% off are considered full price at $170 - $180.  Service? Meh. Some associates are great, others are just.. ugh. Too snotty for words because I don't waste my money or my words."}
{"text":"High end department store for all the needs your wallet doesn't agree with.   The staff at this location is usually friendly and helpful (compared to the other one) even on days I dress like a bum. They have a huge selection in the shoe department but the purse section was lacking. You can find great deals here when things go on sale but you have to have the time and patience to dig through everything.  I'm still sad HR is no longer working with AMEX because I really liked the perks of the HR AMEX card. Maybe sometime again in the future?"}
{"text":"They have changed their valet parking so now even if you drop $1k shopping you don't get comped for the parking and still have to pay $25. Ridiculous. The door man was missing today. No sales person greeted me or offered assistance. I had to repeatedly ask people for help. I went there looking for a tailored alpaca or cashmere coat or perhaps a thin, draped shearling, either way, about a $1500-45000 coat and was only helped when I approached them directly and asked for help. Then they were friendly, but I could also sense to the typical commission-based potential customer evaluation stare.  I realize I don't look Iike their core demographic but I thought they were trying to be more inclusive lately. Holt's has been trying to improve their notoriously snotty attitude in the last few years and it is better but it still lingers in the air like a bad smell. And the selection was bizarre; even the salespeople commented on the dearth of selection this season in coats. A million Canada Goose but about four Mackage non-parka coats. Off to Saks I go a-seachin'!"}
{"text":"Holt Renfrew Gift Card = EASY TO COPY I'm one of many victims of Holt Renfrew's gift card duplication scam. Holt Renfrew gift cards do not have the security features that other retailers carry. Anyone can copy Holt Renfrew gift cards. Over one thousand dollars worth of money in my Holt Renfrew gift card was gone. I did my research on the Internet and found out how easy it was to duplicate Holt Renfrew gift card. I'm now able to duplicate Holt Renfrew gift card with a $50 card duplicator. Search Holt Renfrew gift card scam on the internet and see it yourself. Before leaving bad reviews on the internet, I talked to a number of different Holt Renfrew managers about my experience. I even emailed the CEO explaining how easy it was to duplicate their gift card, and why Holt Renfrew shoppers' money were at great risk. They couldn't care less. The email went into the CEO's mailbox, but not a single reply. They were just hoping that I would give up and stay quiet so they don't have to deal with the victims of their gift card duplication scam. But that's not how the Internet works. I started to write my experience on the Internet informing others. Guess what? Holt Renfrew replies right away. I must have been a fool believing that Holt Renfrew actually cared about their customers and not customers' dollars. I emailed them and got an automated email saying they have received it. Guess what? Zero reply. Companies like Holt Renfrew will do anything to please online reviews, but won't do anything once people contact them. They are just trying to \"show\" the online crowd they \"care\", when all they care about is customer's money. Here is one word for you, Holt Renfrew. You guys are DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"This was once the best you could get in Toronto and that doesn't mean it was good, it just means it was the best you could get in Toronto.  The selection at Holts is good but the sales staff is sparse and typically unfriendly and unapproachable. Don't dare disturb them while they are busy. I've traveled extensively around the world and Toronto is the only city I know where being in retail sales is all about attitude and nothing to do with service and Holts does noting to dispel this. Despite this I still can't resist a walk through the men's wear department. With no sales help in sight it can be hard to find things.  I've never understood the logic where it is important to keep sales staff busy with everything except sales. I don't know if Holts has staying power at this point. I expect to walk by one day and see the name changed to Joe Fresh... another brand owned by the Weston family."}
{"text":"My experience was top rate at this Holt Renfrew - everyone was so incredibly friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed my first shopping experience here (never been before).  As soon as I walked in the store, I was greeted by sales staff in all departments as I explored the large store. I needed a purse for a friend and Holt had a section in the store for all the top brands. Luckily, I knew the brand and asked to be directed to the Prada section.  The three sales associates working in the Prada department were all fantastic - they explained the different types of purses, took them all out for me to look at (way too many options) and all provided their personal recommendations (I'm hopeless in this regard!!!!). My friend loved the purse... so the recommendations paid off.   The store is laid out beautifully and not over crowded. A department store for all the top brands - one stop shopping. Wish I tried Holt before, would have saved me lot's of running around in the past.  I will be back for sure. Next time I will get something for myself as well!!!!!  BK"}
{"text":"Every time I feel like quitting school, I go to Holt's.   Holt's reminds me that I can't afford the lux stuff I want all the time. The hope is: finish school and get expensive stuff whenever, if ever, I want. I like expensive stuff now, I just don't tempt the debt-devil by window-browsing. You know how the saying goes, \"out of sight, out of mind\".  Just a quick romp through Holt's and I'm back on track to churning out papers with disturbingly long titles. Coincidentally enough, said papers are usually about consumption and hence, Holt's is also a great place to re-align baseline observations of bougie dreams (i.e. gawk at the purchase and display of status)."}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times for gifts for that special someone, and at first I've always tried to avoid it based off of the reviews and what people told me, with regards to snobby employees.  My few experiences here were however quite pleasant.  I've always been asked if I needed help by employees and there always seems to be several employees ready and willing to assist you with all your needs.  The store itself looks a bit dated.  To be honest with the amount of revenue they pull in, I figured they would at least renovate the place a bit more.  It looks like an old Sears outlet store inside, and the displays are often cluttered or disorganized.  It's relatively easy to find the different departments, but I find I'm usually asking around to find specifically what I am looking for.  They do have loyalty incentives if you shop here a lot as they mail out gift cards, coupons and other assorted promotional things for regular customers.  It's a nice treat considering how hard it is to find a deal off high end merchandise they carry.  Overall I'll probably be back here again for that next special occasion, but I do think the store needs a bit of an update.  Compared to the rest of the stores on Bloor, it falls a bit short on the looks department."}
{"text":"favorite department store in town. smells nice and sales people are super nice and professional! yes thing are expensive but quality so worth the price. buy less buy better at HR. never regretted anything got from holt renfrew on bloor. (yorkdale location is not as good at bloor location no doubt)  and they accept american express credit cards"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Dior Cosmetics. So when my friend and I were looking to purchase touch up make-up for her wedding, I immediately suggested Dior. Was referred  to Lee at the Dior counter by a friend who recently got her make-up done there. Lee is amazing! She knows the Dior line well and she is just the best of the best as an makeup artist.  Gave us the perfect makeover, and recommended products that were suitable for our skin and style. We were very pleased with her work and I would recommend her to anyone."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here but the sales in cosmetics and 2nd and 3rd floor clothing is shockingly lazy and rude. It sort of came for an end to me when I purchased a lipstick and upon arriving at home, realized I had been given the wrong color - so I had to return BACK the next day - total waste of time to return it - well, when I arrived, the clerk gave me a hard time because there was a rip in the packaging (this was the way I had bought it!!!) and she proceeded to lecture me how I should ALWAYS check my purchases before leaving a store. Wtf? How rude. How about it's your job when you are selling an already over priced lipstick at 45$ to make sure it's the goddamn right color. -- This was btw at he Bobbi Brown counter - and I never buy my Bobbi Brown stuff from Holts because every single time, no fail, they are so rude - now I just got to Sephora or the Bay. I've had it."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. If you don't get dressed up to shop, the sales people will look at you disdainfully then go back to their phone conversation or gossip session with other sales people. I don't think I should have to get dressed up to go shopping!  Beware their seasonal sales. If you are a dedicated follower of a particular line you'll see items in the racks that are from seasons as far as two years back (with the wear and grime of poor storage and too many try-ons).  Do NOT use the valet service at Bloor St. I often park in that greenp lot. I frequently see high-end cars squealing at high speed around the corners on the upper levels and invariably, one of the uniformed valets hops out once the car is parked. The valets are mostly youngish guys who will abuse your car."}
{"text":"A cross between Saks 5th Avenue and Neiman Marcus. Smaller than i expected and really nothing i could feasibly afford here...!"}
{"text":"Horrible, unenthusiastic, unhelpful sales representative at the Nobis/Moose Knuckle jacket section on the lower concourse. I came in to purchase a men's nobis jacket today at around 5:45pm. I was set on getting a size large and this sales rep did not even seem interested in making the sale, helping us look for other store locations that had the size and jacket type. Long story short, due to the atrocious customer service I experienced today, this girl lost her sale. Management - please look into this. How or why do you even hire people like this? I don't think I'll be returning to Holt Renfrew on Bloor St. I will stick to Yorkdale."}
{"text":"This is the best Holts in Toronto.  Recently I met up with friends from US who came to look for something \"different\" from what they can find down south.  This gives me a new appreciation for Holts.  Yes, it carries a lot of the same brands that you could find in US, but Holts buyers may choose pieces that are different from what their US counterparts would select, presumably more attuned to Canadian taste,  More choices are usually good for consumers.    Services are proficient and professional"}
{"text":"Wonderful variety at store. Great high end brands for shoes and handbags. Prada, Manolo Blahnik, Burberry, and much much more.  Downfall - the store was very busy and disorganized due to the amount of people that were shopping inside the store. I was not able to find handbag that I wanted or an associate to get assistance.  I would definitely try this store again if I was in Canada."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's b/c I'm not from Canada, but I love this place.  I mean, we have stores like it in the States, but there's something nicer about it.  Maybe it's b/c I think everything about Canada (Toronto in particular) is nicer and sweeter.  Regardless, this store is great."}
{"text":"Aside from previously working here, I wouldn't come here to shop.  Yes, they have nicely decorated windows and decor around the store but I have to say, the people that work here aren't always the friendliest and come across stuck up because they work for a high-end retail store.  If you are underdressed or not dressed to their expectations, do not except to have anyone approach you for assistance.  They are a busy store and with that being said, you almost always have to ask for help.  They do on the other hand, have a variety of different brands and they have the newest collections of handbags, clothing, etc. but I only really shop here for cosmetics and on the rare occasion a handbag here or there because I still know some of the people that work here.  I've bought a couple of pieces of clothing from here, and they are highly overpriced and the quality of the clothes are not the best.  They tear and rip really easily.  For instance, I bought the boyfriend a pair of jeans and within a year or two of wearing them, they've faded quite a bit and they are also torn in all the wrong places.  Even their sale items are usually still overpriced for what they are worth, but I guess it's because you're paying for the designer label.  If I never had worked here and had my employee discount, I don't think I would ever spend my money here or afford to buy anything at regular price."}
{"text":"Holt Renfrew on Bloor actually has the worst customer service I've ever had. I don't know what it is, but it's consistently awful every time I go there. My only criteria for decent customer service are: a) be available, and b) be helpful. Friendliness goes a long way, too. Having worked in retail once upon a time ago, I try to be a good customer and expect good service in return.  I don't expect the moon, but at these prices, I should certainly get it.  I needed to update my wardrobe, so I headed over to Holt's for a couple of pairs of shoes. The only reason I continue to shop here is because of the selection and proximity to home/work. I found a sales associate to help me get the sizes I needed. She looked annoyed as I interrupted her texting, and was very unfriendly and unhelpful throughout the process, scowling the entire time. I happily left and ordered everything I needed online, and she didn't make any commission on my sale."}
{"text":"I walk in here knowing I can't afford a single item of clothing or shoes, but it's a great segway from spending too much money, to taking a look at nice things that I cannot afford (and thereby not spending money). This is why I come here.   Other reason is to stock up on my Shu Uemura skincare products (which are not $$$$$ but quite $$$), and I'm so pleased the Holts decided to finally pick them up instead of me buying it via people overseas. They have great free stuff when I buy it, and Priya at the counter is super nice, and always remembers to call me when I think I need to stock up. I can pre pay or pick it up in the store. Makes me feel like a VIP for 10 seconds, and that's kind of nice.   They also have beauty/makeover days, which I haven't yet partaken in, but only require you to buy $70something worth of product (and if it's something you regularly buy, then it's a great deal).   They have free valet parking thurs/fri/sat from 10 til 6pm. A great way to score some free parking if you're in the area.   Also I really like the holts cafe downstairs."}
{"text":"Holt's is a terrific upscale department store. My only experience is with their men's wear so my review doesn't reflect on the Women's part of the store (i.e. 75% of their business).  They have a lot in common with other high-end men's retailers in Canada, including the absurd Canadian mark-up on prices, but the stores feels and looks much better than Harry Rosen. The staff are more informed (which isn't saying much but it is indeed true) and the selection is also better.   Holt Renfrew on Bloor should also be noted as being the sole Canadian distributor of Ralph Lauren Black Label suits in Ontario. Only Holt's in Vancouver has the BL suits. The sales folks in the Ralph Lauren department are more knowledgeable than the non-brand specific associates that roam around. However, as an avoid shopper in the States, I can't help compare prices and I only make large purchases at Holts when they are on sale. A tie here and there is no big deal, but they simply can't touch the retail prices of Saks and Nieman's, and when there is a sale at those two places, forget it, not even close."}
{"text":"I'm in inclined to be very trusting of luxury type places. The prices alone should guarantee quality and taste, whether it be in food, clothing, furniture, anything. A deli adjacent to Holt Renfrew holds so much promise. Clean and tastefully decorated, the menu looked equally interesting. Three different kinds of spring rolls (the mushroom, in particular, looked good), freshly made soup, sandwiches and, at the very end of the line, cupcakes!   But everything fell a bit short. The spring rolls were a tad stale from having been left out in the open, the soup was okay but terribly salty, the sandwich I ordered was soggy and my red velvet cupcake.. eh... it was decorated in that cream cheese icing. I know that's traditional but I've always preferred the sugar one.   In conclusion, you are better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Sisley counter never has anything in stock and the sales associates always have colds."}
{"text":"Bad Costumer Service . The lady at the female sunglasses department upstairs was so unproffesional and couldn't find me the sunglasses I was looking for from the model number - The male clerk sownstairs was very snooty ."}
{"text":"At least this season, HR's menswear buyers have outdone their Barneys counterparts.  Very well (if tightly) edited -- the small shoe department, in particular, left more to be desired -- but the two men's floors showcased winning selections from a broad range of designers.  Wish I had been there during a sale or when the US dollar had been stronger!"}
{"text":"I went two weeks ago to Holts because there was a foundation from Bobbi Brown that I wanted and they were the only ones carrying them in store.    As soon as we got there I thought it was closed and doorman said they were still open and graciously opened the doors for me.  I went to the Bobbi Brown counter and there was no one there mind you it's still half an hour before close.  I asked the concierge if there was anyone working the counter.  A minute later some sale rep showed up not looking happy at all.  I told her that I would like to get colour matched.  She took three colours and smeared them across my cheeks and they were such heavy streaks they all looked wrong.  She handed me a mirror and said choose.  I told her I couldn't because there would be no way to tell if it was the right colour with how much she smeared across my cheeks.  She was huffy the entire time and then proceeded to blend and said again to choose.  It's a good thing that I'm well versed with foundations because I was able to pick the colour I wanted.  The attitude was very unpleasant and service was horrible.  This is not the first time that I have encountered bad service at Holt's but now that I have my colour I will be buying online for sure.  I have complained in the past about their terrible service but have never received a response.  Pretty sad for such an upscale company"}
{"text":"Beautiful merchandise....very costly but those are the prices the labels they carry command.   If you have a LOT of money that you want to spend on clothes this is probably the best store in the city in which to do so.  My issue is with their ridiculous return policy.  You have a WHOLE 24 HOURS to return sale merchandise.  Really?  Do they think that their clientele have nothing better to do than run back to one of only 3 stores in the GTA the very next day if they find that something that was bought does not work?   Maybe some of their customers actually have day jobs that would prevent them from shopping every day?  I realize that returns are a hassle for stores but to me this policy suggests that this company does not value their customers."}
{"text":"Holts is a high end store in a very posh/rich neighbourhood. It's a hit and miss kind of love I have with this baby. Some days it treats me so well (friendly staff, not snooty/stuck up) and other times I get the cold shoulder.   Yes I can afford to shop at this place, although the $$$ should be going towards better things...  I'm always intimidated to approach the makeup counters because I absolutely cannot stand someone who is pretentious and will try to get me buying 40 different products for my acne face. I just want to look at a lipstick m'dear. Is that so wrong?   Shoes, bags and makeup are extensive here. The clothing collections here are OK.. I will return when I really need a cheering up."}
{"text":"A girl's dream - the beauty section reminded me of Bergdorf's.  It has so many varieties and selection to choose from. Jemma Kidd, Bond 9, Bobbi Brown, Chanel, and...  I am sad that they no longer keep their private label since I was hoping they still had this one top there.  There's not much else I could say since this is another typical high-end department store. They carry the same thing in NY and this is why I was hoping they still had their own private label.   If I am going to shop out of the country - I want to get stuff that you won't be able to find back at home.  Not to mention Staff here were all so pleasant!"}
{"text":"Having come all the way from Australia for Canada's Holt Renfrew I was disgusted beyond belief! The management of this place need to give their snobby staff a big talking to! The staff here need to realise it's not about them it's about the customer and leave their egos at home. I felt  incredibly unappreciated and back home I usually am wearing a suit which I think would have got me attention in this place. Dressed casually I felt like I was about to be spat on by the staff. My friend and I left immediately.   Having working In a family property business in one do the most blue chip areas in my city I know that ignoring customers by dress standards is a big NO!.Some of the wealthiest clients I have walk around in t-shirts because they have nothing to prove... Unlike the foul staff here! Horrible experience I'll be sure to share!   Looking at many other yelp comments on here it seems other people have had similar experiences. Surprising considering how poorly retail is doing in this country."}
{"text":"??Bloor St?Holt Renfrew?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????HR???????"}
{"text":"I have to say, this place is amazing in customer service. Every Time I go here I am met with such friendly people whose eager to serve you or answer any questions. Such an amazing company.. I will be definitely be coming back again and again. J'adore!"}
{"text":"I was invited with a group of ladies to Chanel's Beauty event called \"Coco Game Center.\" I loved how we were greeted in the event with bottled soda pop--very classy! I had fun exploring and experimenting the different colours by myself. I just wished I had someone helping and explaining the products to me--something to consider in future launch.  With the rest of Holt Renfrew, service was meeeh in the majority of the brands that we visited. Maybe they're trying a hassle-free shopping method?!   I would say the most exceptional customer service we received was with Louis Vitton!! The sale associates were super friendly and patient with explaining the products--specifically, handbags. We were served sparking and still water, along with a Nad√®ge cookie in the shape of a stiletto, which was not only super cute but also very delicious!!   Parking downtown is crazy but fear not, Holt Renfrew has their own valet parking! The amount of money you're paying for valet is probably about the same amount for parking downtown so take advantage of it!!"}
{"text":"Like any other area of Yorkville I avoid this location during TIFF unless I want the tourist experience of celeb-spotting.   Yet, this Holt's location has the. best. cosmetics and perfume section ever. Staff is attentive and walk through the variety of perfumes till you find 'the one'. They are generally friendly and mostly professional.   I try to avoid this location for apparel, as I've scored many better items at the Yorkdale location during Holt sales. Surprise!   Their accessories and shoe department rival Davids and are definitely worth a perusal. You won't find the same variety at any other Holt location in Toronto."}
{"text":"Holt's is really not my kind of store. Way to expensive. It's just not something that I can appreciate. Since I don't shop here, I really can review this store. What I would like to review is the massages at Salon and Spa. I went here for the first time a few years ago when I received a gift card for Christmas. The massage was everything a massage should be. Upon arrival you a shown to a change room with lockers, where you cab change into a plush white robe & \"slippers\".  The massage rooms are dimly lit. The 85 minute massage is like heaven.  The 85 minute therapeutic massage is $130. But sometimes spoiling yourself is necessary."}
{"text":"Where dreams are made of......and broken in the same day.  An institution on Bloor St, this store always draws me in.  The beautiful pink facade/signage stands out on the bleak street.  From valet parking (and remember when there was a dedicated doorman?!) this place not so silently screams richness.  Perfectly made up and gorgeous people are the bones that make up this gorgeous store - they look like those airbrushed models.  So if you feel any insecurities or suffer from low self esteem then try and get a blowout and a full made up face before entering (you have been warned!)  One floor is dedicated to cosmetics and perfumes and you find brands that read about but can never find.  Charlotte Tilbury, La Mer, Prada, Jo Malone, etc.  I wish they had a better ventilation system because the mix of the fragrances can be overwhelming at times.   While there is a lot of staff in this store never have I once been approached to see if I need help (I don't own a fur coat or a $5000 purse after all).  I don't like the fact that I never know what each floor has - there is no signage that I can see.  Usually it's by the escalators so you know if you want men's clothing you can go the the XX floor.  I do like that the store is broken up into designer categories - D&G, Kooples, The Row, etc.  Like capsule collections that you can browse.  Yes the prices are steep but that's a given. However their Boxing Day sales are pretty amazing and that's when I usually hit this place up. This week they had lots of items 70% off.  A few years ago I scored my fave pair of jeans here - $220 orig price down to $75.  I still wear them to this day.  Their sales items are pulled into the aisles on racks so you never have to search for them and are always clearly marked.  For cosmetics and fragrances that are unique I would always come here.  They also have some really nice accessories - hats, scarves etc.  This is always my stop during the holiday season to dream."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is so busy.  The food is overpriced and the portions you get don't satisfy you.  I used to come here on my lunch once in awhile for their grilled paninis.  After awhile I wasn't really craving it for the service, cost and snotty employees and customers.  I don't really see the point in spending money at a place that's seems like a fancy cafeteria set-up."}
{"text":"*My 2 star rating is for the service only*  I was here on the weekend, I was thoroughly unimpressed.  The service was shameful, the sales people looked bored and weren`t interested in being helpful at all.  I was at the Kiehl`s counter and the woman looked surprised that I wanted to purchase something.  Holt`s does carry a lot of unique items, and high end brands, but with this kind of service, I`m going to stick to shopping abroad.  I don`t need the stress.  PS Holt`s - shopping for luxury brands, in the US, UK, Europe and Asia is about a kazillion times better than the experience and service provided in your stores.  For a flagship store, you should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"Went in looking for a beret and all 5 associates didn't know what I was talking about/showed me the wrong products. Please hire better knowledgeable staff!"}
{"text":"This place is where Richie Rich, Bruce Wayne, Cruella de Ville, Mr. Burns and other assorted rich cartoon characters shop. And even for them, it's probably slumming it! The first time I went, I went with a girl friend who was bemoaning that the Christian Dior shoes were so last season and she could get better ones in NYC. Yikes, I did not fit it.  The second and subsequent times I've gone, I've visted the cosmetic counters and the cafe on the 2nd floor. A much more pleasant experience! I've purchased a few items from the Shu Uemura counter and I am very satisfied with their level of service. Despite not looking polished and put together, they have given me helpful service and good recommendations. For as long as I can afford it, I may continue visiting them. Also, this is the only place you can Shu Uemura in Canada!"}
{"text":"Racist, disgusting location and establishment!!!!! A few months ago I was in the Gucci store in Holt Renfrew because a friend was shopping for a purse. We overheard a Holt Renfrew staff member pointing out to the manager at Gucci \"You shouldn't have people like that in your store\" in reference to my black friend who has dreadlocks. My friend ended up purchasing a purse from Louis Vuitton instead. Will never return nor will any of my family or friends. Horrible, negative, ignorant store."}
{"text":"Ah. Holts. I bought my all time favorite tie here. A beautiful black and gold Versace tie (http://media1.ct.yelpcdn.com/photo/v6GeLkZRfCh-dVk685XTiA/l) that I've never seen sold anywhere else since and I've never seen a tie as black and goldy and beautiful. Beyond that rare find, I've never found a tie at Holts I've really liked. Everything is very \"office.\" I dunno.  I've bought underwear here. I need those boxer-briefs for running. That upper, inner part of my thigh rubs against the upper inner part of the matching thigh and sleeping that night is pretty red and painful. I need some kind of lining. I was tired of the Zellers stuff wearing out after a couple months and tried the $50 a pair stuff. Pro-tip: don't try to buy Hugo Boss boxer briefs and Burberry boxer briefs in the days running up to the Gay Pride Parade. You can't find the stuff. But I discovered the Hugo and Burberry boxer-briefs thin and tear just as rapidly as the cheap stuff. Now all my boxer-brief needs are served by Joe Fresh. Sorry, ladies.  They have an awesome sweet vanilla tea that goes on sale before Christmas and makes a good gift for sister in laws and father's new wives.  Their nicer Gucci scarfs sell out quickly before winter really starts."}
{"text":"Never would have guessed I would actually be in this place looking to buy something, but I read an article a couple of months ago about men's jeans and they recommended a pair sold at Holt Renfrew for a reasonable price. So when it came time for me to get some new jeans today I thought I would check things out...  First thing I realised when I walked in the store was that I had no idea where anything was. I was greeted with a sea of make-up counters and employees looking at me like I was an alien. I wanted to ask for directions but everyone looked like they didn't want me to speak to them.  Finally wandered around and found some men's clothes. I asked one of the male employees in that section if there were more jeans and he barely looked at me and mumbled \"downstairs.\" Went down some steps and saw a large selection of nice jeans. Saw a couple I even wanted to try on but the THREE employees standing 4-5 feet away from me were busy talking about how scary the movie Paranormal Activity is. At one point an employee actually made eye contact with me, but then continued to ignore.   I could have asked for help but something came over me and I realised I didn't want to give Holt Renfrew any of my money. I muttered \"fuck this\" under my breath and left. Bought some jeans at The Gap and they were super nice and helpful. Never again, Holt Renfrew."}
{"text":"Garbage Compared to Bergdorf Goodman. They jump to assist customers who \"look\" like they have money. Employees try to be very snobby and condescending. Please get off your high horses and remember who the customers are."}
{"text":"It's obvious that the level of customer service you get here is based on what you look like and how expensive your clothes are, even though they're the ones working to serve us!     Also- why do they ask for your phone number when you buy something?  What is this, Radio Shack?"}
{"text":"Oh Holts! How I love you!  If only I had an enormous paycheck.. I would dedicate major time and money to you. For now I will just browse and occasionally treat myself to something I apparently can't live without!  As the Canadian version of Bloomingdales and Barneys, this store is legit and has most (if not all) of the offerings of their American counterparts. There are tons of designers, a wide selection of handbags and a great shoe department. If you want anything high end, from expensive hand cream and make up to beautiful boots and fun party dresses - Holt's has it all.  Bonus - I don't find the sales people especially snobby, as my experience with these kind of stores is they usually profile you and treat you accordingly...  So if you have some money and want to look fine - hit up Holts. You WILL find something to spend your dough on!"}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service. I went to exchange a pair of shorts and buy some summer gear. The service with the two reps was nothing short of amazing. One rep went to another floor to do the exchange for me while the other took care of me helping me pick out some clothes on the main floor. Every single time I am there I feel like royalty. The prices are what they are but if you want to pay for quality designer fashions, this is the place. I find along the mink mile most of the stores have stuffy service but Holts always makes me feel welcome. Thanks again."}
{"text":"The Barney's of Canada, without the attitude.  Even though I no longer have tons of cash to splash here (especially now with the loonie hijacking our dollar), I love visiting the sales staff--so nice! so friendly! Or maybe that was just the Prada shopping bag I was carrying.  They carry the Madison Ave names (Gucci, Chanel, Missoni, etc), as well as lower-priced but still spendy lines (Theory, DvF, Pringle, etc.)  The shoe department is a MUST.  100% must go.  On my quest for perfect wedding shoes, I must have gone in 10-15 times."}
{"text":"I went here with my friends that visited here from out of town. It was my birthday and a friend bought an expensive outfit for myself and he spent an average person salary for a month. When you spend that much there eager to help you and instead of picking things that look good on you they will pick the most expensive things for you to try on. That's what happens when they make commission. My advice is bring a friend along that has a flair for fashion. The salespeople act as if they own the store and act as if there all that. But really there just servants that make as much as people that work at McDonald's. Anyways I'm getting of topic.  When it was time to pay I noticed the salesperson was taking of the tags of all the clothes. I didn't think anything of it. I thought that's what they always do. Well there was a reason he did that.  The week after I decided I wanted to return my gift from my friend since it was a prada dress shirt and chino pants. I'm a contractor so when would I wear these nice set of clothes. I wanted to return it and get something I would use more.  I brought it in and a salesperson looked at it and he said he had to get the manager. Well the manager came down and looked at the pants and shirt. He had the most stuck up attitude. He's says \" it looks like it's been worn and smells of cologne\".  I'm like excuse me \" I didn't wear it and your salesperson is the one that took the tags off\" I also said \"so you sell clothes that looks like it's been worn?\"  He stares at me and says \"yes\"  I was getting really irritated with his attitude and I just wanted to get the refund and get out of there.  I also told him my friend thinks the salesperson charged him full price for a couple shirts he bought. He says \"well the garments not here so we can't do anything about it\"  I literally wanted to punch him in the face. I even showed him the picture of my friends shirt and he totally ignored me. Was I ever pissed.   He also said now they have to spend money to get it dry cleaned.  I wanted to say \"hello!!! I didn't fuckin wear the damn clothes and it's not costing you a fuckin dime because it's not your fuckin store. So stop your fuckin snobby attitude and do your servant job\"  Fuckin stupid people with a false sense of wealth. Never going to this place again."}
{"text":"Interesting store.  It kind of reminds me of a Macys store.  The difference is, there are a lot of high end brand names.  I did think the selection was a little sparse, and one of the floors smelled like old wet mildewy clothes, but the clothes were beautiful.  They had a huge sale going on....maybe that is why the selection wasn't the best.  We walked into the Donna Karen area and I immediately fell in love with the skirt on the mannequin.  I usually \"shop off the mannequin\", as I am the same size as most of them, which I am really thankful for, because I love it when the sales associates put together cute ensembles and I don't have to think about it. :)  Anyway, i tried to make eye contact with a salesperson, and the first 4 made it obvious they weren't trying to be helpful.  Another associate sized us up by telling me the price, and mentioning it was a one of a kind DK, and only came in the size 4.  A sales associate named Duane came over and was very friendly- to which I am grateful.  I've rarely had that happen, so it was surprising.  The last time we were sized up incorrectly was in Cartier, so we just went to Tiffany's and bought our jewelry. :)   Duane offered me a water and the skirt.  I tried it on, and was in love!  It was made for me :). The detailing was amazing, as was the material.    I decided to walk around a bit, since the price was a bit steep -$3,400. Yes, that is correct....on sale at 40% off made it slightly less expensive.  Well, as much as I loved it, I decided that I'd rather spend that money on a nice bag, a coat or more jewels from Tiffany.... Lol.    I'm not going to lie, I can't justify the price....ever... But it was AWESOME trying on a one of a kind Donna Karen! :) I owned that skirt- if only for 10 minutes. :)"}
{"text":"I was blown away by the variety in this store.  Rivaling any Macy's or Nordstrom's, this department store seems very likable.    When my wife and I ventured to the second floor, she immediately fell in love with a $3500 Donna Karan skirt that was on the mannequin.  The sales staff stated this was a one of a kind, and despite the one male salesman seeming to size us up as unworthy, another very nice man (Duane) was eager to help us get the skirt off the mannequin and available for her to try on.    Long story short, she loved it, an we will certainly consider picking it up later.  The initial salesman's acting like we couldn't afford it ticked me off.  My wife wants to go back, but I was unhappy with the service so it will take some convincing.  Shame on the first salesperson.  He blew Duane's almost certain sale."}
{"text":"I am by no means rich, but Holt Renfrew is too beautiful and decadent to resist. The guards at the front are lovely, and the staff will always treat you with respect even if you're dressed in rags.  I had the fortunate luck to swing by in December and the store was in full holiday cheer- they had free hot chocolate, Christmas caroling, and an artist to make fashion sketches of you if you asked.   Prices are steep of course, but their sales really bring in buzz and warmth to the otherwise untouchable place for the less-wealthy. I also love the tiny pop-up stores they bring in that sell macarons, donuts or tea. This location of Holt Renfrew is massive and sprawling- I can spend hours in here!"}
{"text":"Went here with my cousin during our lunch breaks and it was pleasant experience. The store has two floors (I've only been on the ground floor) and they offer alot of selection. The employees are very helpful and very accommodating. Not persuading for you to buy anything but enough to answer any questions you may have. They cater to everyone even on days where I look casual."}
{"text":"Just stopped by this weekend because they had a sale for people on their email list. My friend was shopping for a new fragrance and we met Daniel, who works at the Tom Ford fragrance counter. He was UBER-helpful, genuine and kind, without being overbearing or pushy. You could tell that he knew a LOT about fragrances (I don't, but my friend is quite the connoisseur and the two of them were talking about the ins and outs of different scents, using fancy terms like 'sillage' - which refers to the trail of a scent that lingers from a perfume, and talking about fragrance blogs) and loved sharing his passion with customers. My friend and I have very different tastes in perfumes. Once we told him what perfumes we like, he was able to find a bunch of options for each of us (in different price ranges) that were spot on. We were both really impressed by this. Many of the scents were unisex and he had worn them, so he could let us know the differences between them, like which ones will last all day vs. just a couple hours, or which ones got him the most phone numbers;P He asked for our names and got to know us and really went the extra-mile. He was chatty without being fake, didn't pressure us to buy on the spot (especially with fragrances, it's nice to try it on and walk around and see how it smells on you). If you are in the market for a new scent and are looking for something different from what everyone else is wearing, look for him. Holt's carries a bunch of lines that are exclusive or hard to find (e.g. Tom Ford private blends are only found at Holt's and Harry Rosen)."}
{"text":"Came back a few more times and I'm still going to give this review a 3 star.  Still love the eye-candy, saw some cupcakes and I will post the pictures soon.  I discovered a really yummy combination of turkey ham, cranberry and some kinda soft brie cheese?  Sooo good, I had it in a wrap and then in some type of artistan bread. But then, I found another thing that disappointed me.  Their customer service.  The first few times I went in there I heard one worker complaining, but again today I had this one lady say \"I'm on break\" three times while facing me and when I said \"excuse me?\" she said she wasn't talking to me.  When I asked for an empty cup she said she only had a plastic one, which I refused.  I redirected myself over to the espresso bar and asked for one of their many stacked cups there while clearly showing my Holt Renfrew bag, indicating that I had just made a purchase there and the lady still gave me a bad time.  She said I can have a free mini cup that they have out with the complimentary lemon water.  I said I didn't want that one... (or else I would have gotten it myself) and she finally, after much hesitation, decided to give me a paper cup.  The attitude there seems very catty."}
{"text":"Of all my friends I consider myself the most ironic and the least naive.  So why is it that when I got to Holt Renfrew do I turn into an idealist and can't understand why everyone in the world has to be so mean?    I am not saying that Holt Renfrew is the world, but to the store's regal regulars and employees it is and it seems to me they do everything in their power to make me feel like I don't belong in it.  One Question:  What the HELL???  I just want to drop some of Visa's money on a Marc Jacob's purse (of which there is plenty) and get into debt for the rest of my life, why won't they let me?    Okay, I am exaggerating, Holts is more than happy to take my money and they do have a beautiful store and exquisite merchandise, I Just feel uncomfortable in the place and the staff doesn't ease that discomfort at all.    If you're not rolling in it, Holts is at most a special occasions' store or for the shopping masochist it's a great place to tour around and look at all the designer clothing, jewelry and makeup you can never have."}
{"text":"I Love to shop Holt Renfrew it very high end store, but only if you could afford it.  I love shop there only for the fresh bake cake and sandwich."}
{"text":"I love fashion so obviously this is a great place for fashionistas. It's a great place for high quality shoes, purses, cosmetics and clothes and when they have sales it's a great place to find decent deals for designer labels. Customer service is always friendly and greeters are nice to me too. I have their loyalty Amex card and I'm quite satisfied with it. It's worth having if you are into luxury fashion like me!"}
{"text":"This location is my favorite one in Canada! Best cosmetics section and amazingly, the staff are friendlier here than in the drab Ottawa location (don't get me started on Yorkdale).  Gorgeous merchandise - even if I don't buy it, I still enjoy window shopping here.  Great bathroom location if you're needing to freshen up downtown. Very posh :)"}
{"text":"National embarrassment.  I thought the Bloor location would be better than Sherway, but based on my expectation and the fact that it's Bloor Street, this location is almost worse.  Almost.      Handbag section is on the small side and the selection isn't great.  They have mall brands like Michael Kors - why is this even at Holt Renfrew, when you can buy at the mall??  And they don't carry stuff like Proenza Schouler.  No Chanel, didn't see any Prada, but if you're looking for MCM (ugly!) or Rebecca Minkoff, this place has got you covered!  Honestly, this place needs better buyers.  I just walked in, tried to find what I was looking for and couldn't, and walked out.  Didn't even bother taking the escalators upstairs.     No wonder most people shop online.  Can't wait until Nordstrom/Saks come here!"}
{"text":"I only shop at Holt Renfrew to buy the perfumes from the jo malone counter. Moving to toronto just a few months ago I visited this location to pick up a new supply and was thoroughly disappointed. The whole thing being jo malone is to layer their scents. I walked out of there with 2 samples to see which other one I would buy to layer with the one I had already bought! If somebody is buying a 30 ml bottle of perfume for $75... throw a few more samples in... how else are you supposed to sell and how is the customer supposed to know what they want to pair it with? Stock up and quit acting so cheap!"}
{"text":"First off I have to say I do not have loads of money, fancy clothes or dimonds on every finger....but when I walk I to Holts I am treated like a millionaire. I am addicted to fine skin care and recently purchased a new mask from La Mer. The associates at the La Mer counter were fantastic and loaded me up with fantastic samples. Love you two and I will be back on Friday to buy more La Mer  Every time  I have ever gone into the Bloor location I am greater by happy, professional people, who respect where they work AND treat their customers like gold. They are not snooty Im sure they can be, but if you walk in there with no attitude you get treated with no attitude.   Now for the \"new design\" Holts at Yorkdale??? You will never see my money. Before I purchased at the Bloor location I was looking at the same product at Yorkdale....well the associate could NOT get off the damn phone! I stood there staring at here for a good 10 minutes, all the while she gabbed on in Russian to a friend. I got fed up, grabed a box and walked to the service desk asking for the price. The service desk asked if I wanted the La Mer assistant to help me and I said \"no, I'd rather not, she is to busy talking on the phone\"   The 'customer service' person just looked at me, checked the price and that was it! No apology, nothing!! I'm sorry folks, but if I'm about to drop over $250.00 on a face mask you could at least act like that's a bit of a deal. Your in retail!!   The associate saw me talking to the customer service desk and finally hung up the phone as I was walking back to put the box back...she knew I was ticked and tried to convince me to purchase. I asked for a sample, and she opened the jar while telling me that she didn't have any samples and that I should just buy the item because it's the most amazing thing ever made. Anyways, long story short I didn't buy from them...I got on the subway and went to Bloor and had a wonderful experience  Too add to the pathetic experience at Yorkdale is the new design of the store. It is sterile, cold and frankly cheap looking...yes cheap.  If anyone reads this and works for the Bloor location, please don't ever change."}
{"text":"Meh.  For people who have shopped in Asia, this is like a desert and I don't mean desert oasis.  Its ok and nothing more.  The only thing that I will say is that they have a good selection of womens' cosmetics and the sunglasses section is acceptable.  Clothing is a big meh for me at this location."}
{"text":"Consistently great service. The ratio of staff to customers is unparalleled in Toronto - no other department store can beat this.   The result is definitely seen in the mark-up but there are great marketing promos to make up for that. Clothes are often on sales as well. Considering they exclusively carry certain products as well, you just don't have an option sometimes.  I will say however, the marketing can go a bit over the top - receiving phone calls to tell you about new products is unacceptable in my opinion."}
{"text":"A fashionistas paradise!  Amazing brands and merchandise, some affordable and other stuff I can only dream about.  It is a very fun store to explore and the merchandise is gorgeous!  Staff is a little hit or miss.  The gal in handbags I encountered was great!  Super friendly but there were a few people that just looked at me and didn't even say hi.  Whatever, get over yourself.  Since I used to work in high end retail I have very little patience for people like this but find it laughable because the reality is they are insecure about what they do for work and that is sad.    I did find out sales tax in Toronto is 13% so don't waste your money buying something (like moisturizer or the standard cosmetic lines) that is easily available to you in the US.    So why only 3 stars? When you offer $8000 Tom Ford leather jacket, $50 lipsticks, and $5000 handbags your staff needs to be on point.  I'm not saying you need to kiss the hind quarters of your customers but genuineness, a sincere smile and thankfulness go a long way.  I did not particularly see anything that could not be purchased somewhere else.  Minus 2 stars."}
{"text":"This store is from a movie. So beautifully decorated for every season. The boutiques are mini art galleries in themselves and did I mention the shoe department? The valet parking makes life simple as if you've been to Toronto you understand the parking issues. The downside the price tags in this place don't exactly say affordable for the everyday person. Still its a great place to explore."}
{"text":"Dammit Holt's!   I come here to meet-up with a friend before dinner and you make me drop $60 on my selfish self  on luxe soap & lotion within seconds of me being in your stratosphere!  I'm not even done all my Xmas shopping yet!  I fully intended to do a quick in and out, pick-up my friend from the Armani men's dept and get the hell out, but nooo,  your well merchandised and tempting sights and smells in the form of Laura Mercier's signature delicious smelling concoctions ensnare me in it's olfactory delights.    Special shout out to the SA ( I think her name was Emily?) who was super nice and not the clingy, or looking down their nose type of salesperson.  Heck Emily even suggested a great restaurant (Cafe Nervosa) for my friend and I to check out as we were vacillating out loud where we should eat, while she rang up my purchase.  Oh well, at least bathtime has been upgraded from the standard Aveeno oatmeal wash to super indulgent experience by way of Laura Mercier Honey Lemon Tart deliciousness...Maybe my $$$ soap can help me to lather up hubby for a trip to Paris ;)"}
{"text":"I only came here because of the in-store personalized Nutella printing service (limited Christmas promo). I was greeted at the door & approached by a friendly greeter who physically showed me where I needed to go. Anyone interested, the Nutella service is $12.99 (tax inc), four jars per customer (you can always come back on a different day to order more). This stocking filler service is a wonderful gift for anyone..."}
{"text":"Our one truly high-end department store (Holt Renfrew) boasts a floor and a half of menswear, including the usual suspect brand like Armani and Ralph Lauren Black Label, and a competent made-to-measure program.   I bought my first \"grownup\" suit here, for first-year law firm summer job interviews. I spent the summer poolside instead, but wore the suit to death.   The sales staff were professional and quick to teach me about this new world, but could be pushy.   Continuity of service is an issue here, since they seem to turn staff over very quickly. A computer system records preferences and purchases, but shopping is more of an art than an algorithm, and I appreciate the occasional call from a salesman who knows my tastes and wardrobe, and isn't afraid to take an educated guess about what I might be in the market for."}
{"text":"This review pertains specifically to the Jo Malone fragrance counter at Holts Renfrew Bloor street location.   Holts Renfrew are currently the only distributor of Jo Malone fragrance in Toronto, Canada. I am extremely disappointed at how an employee at Holt Renfrew handled my needs and request to exchange a fragrance and body cream scent which did not suit me purchased and gifted by a friend. Being in fragrance, I would presume she knows fragrance is something very personal and all I wanted was to exchange the body cream and perfume to a different scent which I always use.   Eventhough the body cream and fragrance is new, un opened, same packaging, as Holts Renfrew carried. All the sales associate at Holt Renfrew told me was, it was bought in London it cannot be exchanged. I was terribly disappointed and she didn't even try, but closed the door of opportunity saying no, no, no.  I was also wiling to upgrade the fragrance to a bigger bottle and pay more. By shutting the door close, Holts not only lost a sale (opportunity to upgrade) but also a loyal customer. Classic case of snobbery from Holts and it's associates.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Posh and exclusive, HR is Canada's premiere department store for men and women (the equivalent of Saks or Neiman Marcus).  The downtown Toronto location opened in 1979.  Unless they've renovated it since my visit, the exterior doesn't impress but the interior definitely has the look of an upscale department store.  They carry Alexander McQueen, Imitation of Christ, Temperley, Thakoon, Kate Moss Topshop, Galliano and other brands that appeal to label whores.  Like your typical high-end department store, they have a beauty department, shoes, purses, a spa, salon and a fur salon.    HR is in a class of its own, far more prestigious than The Bay and I was going to say Eaton's but I just learned that Eaton's no longer exists.  Ages ago I went to their outlet store in a suburb of Toronto (I'm not sure where I was).  It was in a strip mall and didn't look too impressive (it looked like your typical outlet store).  That store, called Last Call HR, has moved to Vaughan Mills."}
{"text":"The service is just awful!  I have noticed lazy staff members just leaning against the counters or having conversations between themselves and ignoring customers completely. A recent experience that comes to mind which really crossed the limit to the point where I am looking to take my business online and shop at net-a-porter or shopbob shops alike etc.:   I bought my very first david yurman ring. They sent in as it was a few sizes to big. Well two weeks later when it arrived, it was too small. So back it went and it was going to be another two weeks. Well two weeks came and went and nothing. 3 days into the 3rd week, I called to request an update. Well wouldn't you know the lady on the other line couldn't find it in the system. I said I am coming in. I gave her my receipt and she ended up calling the place they had send it in to and came back saying they had further sent it externally and had not received the ring back. She promised she would call me and let me know the status as soon as they get back to her.  Three additional days go by and so I went back to the store and another lady helped me. She said to come back on Thursday or Friday as that is when they receive their parcels. I actually started laughing. I said, why don't you give me a call and let me know when it is arriving.   I see this business model turning sour very quickly if they do not do somthing about that staff they hire and train. Might as well visit the shops on Bloor itself to get the right service for the prices we pay for these items"}
{"text":"Holt Renfrew is where everyone likes to get their ballin' on. Holt has their own little Prada corner, a Miu Miu corner, a Chanel corner, shoe section, cosmetics, menswear, etc. Lots of glitz and they constantly change up their displays, so visually appealing. Some exclusives to Holt, that you can't find elsewhere in Toronto with instore selection, is Agent Provocateur, and Jo Malone. I'm sure there's a ton others, but I'm not going to sit around listing them.  I find the service can vary. Ex, Holt sends their loyal customers gift cards every few months, like $100 off every $300 spent on apparel. Not bad! But some of the salespeople will tell you that undergarments and outerwear is not apparel. Some others find it perfectly acceptable.   Another way service can vary is how you present yourself while shopping. It's a bit annoying, but I do find that when I'm dressed to impressed, the service I get is better by FAR, as opposed to when I stop by on just a casual day, and I can walk through the whole store without a greeting. Not great.  The doorman is excellent! I'm sure many people recognize him as the dapper man in a top hat who greets anyone within hearing distance - very pleasant!  Overall Holt can be a fun shopping experience, with some wonderful exclusives. Watch out for those gift cards in the mail!"}
{"text":"There is nothing I needed at Holt Renfrew! There is nothing I desire in Holt Renfrew. Please don't get me a gift card here for any occasion, as I would have re-gifted that.....  But, it is fun to browse around as I usually do when I am in the area. I just love to annoy the sales persons and they can size me down as much as they want!  Aside from that, this Holt Renfrew's location has the best selections of everything... and I bet I can find a gift for the Yelp's \"Baron\" of Holt Renfrew with no problem!! or he can have my gift card!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, I refrain from shopping at the one on Bloor due to consistently poor customer service. I bought a purse but it took me 20 minutes to find anyone who was willing to give me the time of day. I would go elsewhere but designer flagships aren't readily available in Toronto sometimes. This place is unbelievable, I remember when a makeup sales lady asked if I \"meant to have a coffee stain on my shirt\"- umm obviously not, thanks for showing me how detail oriented you are in your cattiness.    Management needs to be more careful on who they hire. They make a lot of money from each purchase on commission so it's worth their while to pay attention to people in just jeans, boots and t-shirts."}
{"text":"Holt's is all we've got in Canada in the realm of classy department stores. In American movies, the kids waltz through the Christmas displays at Macy's and their eyes water because it's so beautiful. In Canada, everyone walks past Holt's and their eyes water, half at the displays and half because they can't afford anything.  But even though the prices might be out of control for some, there's no reason to hate on the staff. If you've been to any other high-end retail store in the world (Harrods, Saks, Barney's, etc) or even to some snooty stores in Yorkville, you'll realize that the majority of the staff at Holt's are nowhere close to as rude as they could be. At least I've never felt overly intimidated by them. But maybe that's because I stick to the \"young people\" section, and because I've somehow gotten used to paying $240 for my jeans.  Holts is great to peruse if you want to get ideas of designer collections you like, and then you can just go to H&M and buy the knock-offs two weeks later. It's also good to know that their make-up bonuses are WAYY better than any other store, so if you need to stock up on Clinique, this is the place to do it during bonus time. They usually have good extras for fragrances, I got a huge beach bag for free once.  As much as everything might seem out of reach, they do have really great sales and their house brand isn't too ridiculously over-priced. There are things us normal people can buy at Holts, you just have to give it a chance :)"}
{"text":"Love this store! Shu uemura eye lashes are the bomb! Out standing service at this makeup counter.. Priya Malde is outstanding as one of the beauty ad visors at Shu Uemura counter. I highly recommend booking time with her and getting a consultation with her about makeup and beauty products.  I spend way to much in there when ever I go, Khiels is here as well before they opened on queen so I would stock up on my supplies.  The clothing and shoes in this store are out of this world,,grrr...  wait where is my credit card..damn..see you there.!"}
{"text":"They have amazing sales. I've been coming here for many years. The store itself is great and the holts cafe has amazing food. Service really varies, sometimes you get snobby sales people and sometimes they're too pushy. I would say the sales staff is the biggest drawback."}
{"text":"Great selection of designer goods. If you're a frequent customer, they mail you a lot of offers like 25% back in gift cards or some private sales.  I'd suggest to get help from a younger sales rep. A lot of the older sales reps are really snobby.  What I noticed here is that if you don't dress like you can afford their products, they don't bother trying to help you."}
{"text":"Wonderful shopping mall for ladies! Near my home . Gentlemen polite and the patient  guys and girls work there, greet me with smile. I love to Even it spends me more money on luxurious than shop in duty free. I get great deserve, and well paid."}
{"text":"I usually only visit Holt Renfrew Bloor for convenience and product selection. However, the customer service varies--a lot. On the contemporary women's floor, if you pick up an item (or a few) there are sales associates barging to get you change room. Whereas if you just walk around and look at things, do not expect a greeting (not even a \"hi,\" although a \"hi\" appears on rare occasions). Some sales associates are just busy chit-chatting and gossiping. Also, sales associates will judge solely from what you are wearing. If you are wearing all high-end designers, expect the sales associate to be very \"willing\" to help. If you are wearing casual clothes sales associate(s) will vary on whether they want to help or not. The footwear department lacks good customer service, there are very few workers and rarely anyone asks to help, unless you pick up something and (may) buy it, a sales associate will appear out of the blue. Regardless of the lacking customer service every now and then there is a sales associate that is willing to help or even say \"hi\" (and does not judge). They will offer a change room and also ask if you were looking for something specific. The most lacking customer service is the sunglasses area. There is always this obnoxious old woman (and mid-aged woman) that pick and choose who they want to speak to. The old woman will also stare you down. Terrible!   Really, with sales associate it is a hit or miss; some are extremely helpful, others are not. I have received courteous and nice help from a woman in the Prada boutique and two women on the ground level.  Holt Renfrew did offer their own HR American Express, but they cancelled it. HRAMEX provided exclusive offers to members. Now they have the Holt Icons Privileges (Select or Icon), which does not really have that many privileges unless you spend $50K+/year. I personally preferred the HRAMEX.  Overall, I recommend this Holt Renfrew if you have that \"don't care\" attitude, otherwise you might get aggravated with the constant judging."}
{"text":"I feel like such an imposter in this store.  However, nothing gets between me and my NARS & Laura Mercier.   Imagine my surprise when I walked into Holt's today (honestly - is a doorman fucking necessary?) and saw a Shu Uemura counter immediately upon entering.  I shrieked. Audibly. And dropped my bags. It was a scene out of Legally Blonde to be sure.   I am furious with myself - how did I not know that there's been a Shu Uemura counter at Holt's in Yorkville since July 2009?? UGH. I've been traipsing across the continent stocking up on Smoky Layers (http://www.shuuemura-usa.com/_us/_en/accessories/false-eyelashes/natural/false-eyelashes-smoky-layers.htm), the most amazing falsies of all time. No longer.   Violet, a gorgeous, Amazonian woman with a sweet disposition, hooked me up with a few pairs for $25/apiece. Not cheap, but indispensable and they're a bargain if you reuse them 10x each like I do. Get it sorted, and get your ass down to Holt's. The cosmetics department is daunting, but if you know what you're looking for  P.S.: Nothing at the NARS counter is in stock, ever. I've gone four times in as many months in search of a Red Square lip pencil and the angry looking woman cockney-slash-Arabic accent has sternly told me that \"reds are on back order to all of Canada\" each time. eBay it is!"}
{"text":"A few years have passed, and it's time to update my review for Holt Renfrew.   Over time, I've disengaged with fast fashion. Sure, there are weak moments when H&M calls to me, but I'm trying to invest more in less, and Holt is the beacon when it comes to investing in beautiful clothing.   I'm also a huge fan of their make up counter, which has all of your Sephora and fancier needs without stepping foot in the chaos that is Sephora.   Think pink."}
{"text":"I love this store yet hate this store...the love comes from me roaming it and looking longingly at items I can never afford, the hate comes from me getting angry for not being able to afford them.    I've never had a bad encounter with any staff...I've come across a couple that seemed like they were super important, and maybe needed to be reminded that they work there and don't own it, but that's ok.    I've really only bought purses here, and the staff in that section have always been really nice to me.  I bought shoes once, and they were decent there as well.  The only issue I ever had, was shortly after Christmas last year - when they had alot of sales, and I was wandering around looking at stuff when I noticed the security guard trailing me.  He eventually took a quick peek into my Zara bag, and I was so flabbergasted that I just left.  I was pretty offended, yet not surprised.    However I am a sheep and will return, because I must buy some overpriced shoes!!!  SHOESSS  What a crappy review Haters of this review can probably afford $1500 shoes, and should step aside tbh"}
