{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here for a drink and appetizer during the week.  The drink selection and atmosphere were great.  Also, the service was very helpful and efficient.

We only tried a couple appetizers, but the stuff we tried wasn't great.  We tried the bruschetta with pesto and barrada cheese, but neither me or wife liked it.  We'd definitely come back for drinks, but may pass on trying dinner here."}
{"text":"Many unique spots on the south side this one is no different.  Unique menu items extremely well done, great bar atmosphere with a separate more intimate dining room in he back.  Staff and bar tenders are top notch as is the quinine, all without the high prices of downtown.  A good combination of simple fare with a twist.  Don't pass up this gem of the south side for a modern gastropub experience."}
{"text":"After a disaster of a \"brunch\" at another restaurant. We went to Carmella's for real food.  The owner made our anniversary brunch special. Great place, great owner , great food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a craft cocktail.  Tried two different ones and both were great.  Nice atmosphere, odd but interesting decor.  Veronica at the bar is a delight.  WE will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Carmella's is my favorite south side bar. Heck it maybe my favorite Pittsburgh bar, along with Tender perhaps. As a former south side local I visited here on many evenings and it was never not great. Friendly bartenders, great local vibe and the food is very good too. Then we come to their impressive Whisk(e)y list. You want it, they probably offer it, along with an equally impressive Rum, Tequila and Mezcal selection. What's great is that it's also well priced. As an additional gesture they also offer a personalized book to keep track of whisk(e)y's you've sampled every time you come in."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Carmella's on a random Monday when a brewery we like was closed. (Side note, what is with this state and every restaurant being closed on Mondays?)
The food was wonderful. If I'm being picky, the bacon on our mac & cheese was a little burnt. But that's my only complaint about the food. The scallops with beet risotto was fantastic, as was the mac & cheese. We also split the hanger steak - medium rare. It was cooked perfectly. 

We split a bottle of wine because it was \"Malbec Monday.\" We got half off our bottle of wine. However, it only applied to bottles that were less than $50. And there was only one bottle of malbec on the wine list that applied. It seemed shady, but the wine was good. I've had drinks there before and the beer selection is always great. My husband liked the \"Han Shot First,\" for more than just the name. The mules are always refreshing. 

It's not a cheap dinner - especially when you drink as much as we do. But I would definitely suggest this to friends. Hence why I'm writing this review."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Carmella's and each time I expect it to be more better than it is.  The first time I went, the crab and avocado dip had so much mayo that any other flavor was masked by it.  
          This time around, I had the burrata app which was basically pesto and cheese on toast.  The other item I had was the mushroom ravioli under the Shared Plates menu.  When I ordered this, I asked the waiter how much came with the plate and he said \"enough for one person as a dinner, or for two people to share\".  What came was one(!) ravioli on a plate.  How is this enough for one person as a dinner or two to share?  I would love to know.  The waiter proceeded to ask the kitchen about the plate, and they stated that \"they used to include two small raviolis but that the one bigger one looked better for presentation.\"  I could care less about presentation and more getting enough food to feel full- and the kicker is that the ONE ravioli cost $13!!!  One ravioli for $13?!  I thought they would at least compensate by removing it from the check or bringing out another ravioli, neither of which happened.  

I will definitely not be going back.  This place has been very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Food is good, beer and whiskey selection is beyond excellent. I have to admit though, that every time I come in, I feel like a side note. It always seems very cliquey, like everybody is friends with the owner and I missed the memo. I'm not asking for special treatment, just reasonable. There was a pair of pirate tickets up for grabs and the bartender asked literally everybody at the bar except for me. Obviously, I'm not part of the right club, but I still wouldn't mind being treated like they value the fact that I chose to spend my money here. To clarify, this place is absolutely phenomenal in terms of food and liquor, but expect no attention to be paid to you because all of the owners friends are there."}
{"text":"Carmella's is a must when you are in South Side.  Great atmosphere set by the eccentric decorations.  Whether you're stopping in for a drink or a full meal, the experience is great.  I have only eaten here twice - once for dinner and once for brunch.  Both were delicious! The menu varies daily which means you are always surprised but pleasantly so.  The drinks are also delicious.  I tried a moscow mule since that is what they are known for - not my thing to begin with but it was still refreshing.  They have an expansive whiskey selection and you can become a \"member,\" so to speak, and they will keep track of the ones you have tried.  They also make a mean manhattan and old fashion.  Highly recommended for a meal and/or drinks!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I have ever had. My wife and I sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon prepared to have some cocktails and lunch (likely going to spend around $80-$100) and the bartender was a CHUMP. Basically ignored us the entire time. Left after one drink and tipped him $0.25 - first time I have ever done that. Last time I'll visit that place!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites in Southside. It's such a cool little spot - it's decorated in kind of an old prohibition-style way, very neat. The staff are all well-dressed, kind, and helpful. Music is on point as well. Kudos to whoever is picking the music.

Drink selection is AWESOME. They have fantastic beer, tons of whiskey, and some cool cocktails as well. As far as food goes, I have yet to be disappointed. They have some interesting things on the menu, so this is really the perfect date spot. I have never had a problem finding seating when I come here, which I love. 

You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early supper (with a reservation) on a recent Friday off after an afternoon of Christmas shopping. Got there early (before the dining room was open), so we nestled into a hi-top in the bar and enjoyed a couple of drinks and shared a comforting mac & cheese appetizer. The draft beer choices were engaging, along with the extensive whiskey list. Dinner afterwards in the neat dining room was excellent - Nick took good care of us in the bar and in the restaurant, too. My beef short rib dinner and my wife's scallop \"sharing plate\" were both outstanding. Thanks, Nick - we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"A group of us came in Saturday night and sat in the back just to have drinks.  We had more friends coming so we asked the hostess if we could move to a bigger table and she and the rest of the staff were so nice and cleaned up the bigger table.  Our waiter was great too.  Great drinks and service."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh! 
A different atmosphere. beautiful & peaceful. 
The food was amazing!!  My husband had the bison burger and I had the duck tacos.  Very friendly and courteous. We will visit soon!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service! Drink menu was amazing. The food was also very good. The plates were great to share and the crab bisque was definitely the highlight of our meal!"}
{"text":"I like the vibe in your establishment but I think that you are missing the mark on how to talk to and treat people in a higher end restaurant. Take it or leave it ...my opinion

Jim"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time ever. The Decour and ambience is absolutely amazing. What a transformation it is from the previous dive bar.

It is definitely a casual atmosphere and no need to get dressed up. I went here with two other guys and our wives and we went for more of a family-style meal. We just wanted to try out as many dishes as possible as they looks so good


The guy started out with different varieties of liquor all based on recommendations of the bartender and we're certainly not disappointed.

We started off with the shrimp ceviche appetizer, meat and cheese platter, baked clams and macaroni and cheese with bacon bits. All of them were awesome.

We all shared the pork chop, crabcakes, a burger, and the duck tacos. The Porkchop was the star of the night followed by the bison burger.

I can't wait to come back here again for some drinks. This is definitely one of the places to add to the top hipsters list of places to hang out in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Carmella's is a diamond in the rough! It's atmosphere is awesome and the food and drinks are just as good. We take all out out of town guests there for brunch...the chicken and waffles are something special and the burger of there day won't disappoint. Not to mention...the bloody Mary's...yum!!"}
{"text":"Amazing whiskey selection. Cheese and meat board hit the spot. Prime strip was very well cooked and duck fat fries were to die for. Only thing the meal needed was a little salt on the steak."}
{"text":"We came here based on Yelp reviews and they were right. It is solidly good. Not silly fancy, not showy, not trendy, but just... You will like it. I'm not the pretentious food-reviewer type, but I know good from bad. I had two cocktails, both were good. I had a pork chop entree. I was worried because even \"good\" restaurants serve pork chops that taste like I imagine those fire-starter logs taste. What I was served was the way a pork chop was meant to be.  It was juicy, tender, and flavorful. For dessert we had cookies and milk that were clearly baked when ordered and had ALL of the butter in them. Perfect."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for a conference and a group of us were directed there.by a friendly local couple we found.  We enjoyed the friendly, fun atmosphere so much, we made a point of going back a few nights later.  We got there too early for the kitchen to be open but the chef opened it for us.  The food was awesome.  You really have to try the U Peel shrimp and duck fat fries!  We had Paige as our server, both nights, and she is phenomenal!  She is very knowledgeable and personable.  She made our evenings memorable."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back and eat here. I just had drinks and they were divine (pic is banana infused bourbon). The atmosphere is great, this may be my new favorite watering hole."}
{"text":"Always have enjoyed this place as a hangout because of the atmosphere and drink selection, but finally got around to trying the food. It did not disappoint. The meatball dish and the gnocchi were my favorites. My friends that had the bisque said that was their favorite. Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"First let me say that the bar is great and I would definitely recommend stopping by here for drinks. A group of my friends tried it out for brunch today and it was a but disappointing. We were the only ones here and service was both slow and a bit confusing. It was difficult for my friend with a food allergy to order as they weren't very flexible with substitutions, but didn't make that clear when she was ordering. The food was pretty good, but pretty much every egg that was served was over cooked. Granted this is only their second week serving brunch, so I'm sure they are going to improve and are just working out some of the glitches."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money on Carmela's Plates & Pints on the South Side.  My wife and I walked into this place tonight for a nice dinner based on the \"no wait\" app stating there was no wait and to \"come on in\" for immediate seating around 7:35 pm.  This restaurant had more open tables than tables with people seated at the time we entered.  The hostess informs there will at least a 25 minute wait. We said even with the many open/available tables and the communication on the \"no wait\" app and the response again was 25 minutes. I left and took my business to another establishment.  I have no intention to frequent this place in the future.  In fact, this experience was so poor that I wanted to inform all of you not to waste your time with this place and to take your good earned dollars to another Pgh. restaurant."}
{"text":"Cool ambiance and excellent food. Great beer selection. 

Loved brunch, never had a bad meal here"}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food, great prices, great service and an awesome atmosphere! If this place wasn't in the South Side I'd be there almost every week. The food and drinks were straightforward and yet elevated. Outstanding quality. I didn't leave here hungry and yet out a $100 like a lot of the highly rated, new restaurants in the City now a days. How it is not on all the Best of Pittsburgh Magazine lists, I have no clue. Guess there is no media quid pro quo with this place which makes it that much more appealing. South Side or no, I will definitely be back. Absolutely loved it! If Carmella's is ever looking to expand (or move) please come to the North side!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11am for brunch on Sunday.  Was greeted with a smile from the staff as we entered.  Even though they just opened the entire staff with moving with a purpose.  
We sat outside on the patio and I thought the long narrow table was strange,  but actually worked very well when dining.  The server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and describe some great specials.
We had there version of a Mint Julio and it was on point.  We had the special appetizer with Duck cracking and sampled two great brunch items.  The server course out meals and extremely attentive.  I food was fresh and tastes were well balanced.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the top 3 brunch spots in Pittsburgh. Great atmosphere and the food is simply amazing. The scallop Benedict is great. Definitely a must try brunch spot in Pittsburgh! You ban be sure to wow your friends at this place. Grab a Bloody Mary while you are there!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on Sunday afternoon after a very rough Saturday to relax and recooperate. And this was absolutely perfect. The day was beautiful, with a warm sun and a light breeze; the windows were wide open and we, of course, grabbed a table on the patio against Carson. There are four two-person tables, and a little cramped if they are all full - but still perfect. Another bonus, there was live entertainment - a very mellow acoustic guitarist, and we loved him. Definitely added to ambiance. We had waters, my friend had a glass of wine. We made it there during their Sunday happy hour - which was awesome. Discounts on food and the drinks. We split the crab avocado dip and the shrimp tacos - and both were delicious, small fares. Towards the end of our visit, around 5, the crowd increased and our waitress really lagged - no refills, no check-ins and it took forever for our checks. But I think she was the only one working the entire crowd, and she was still very pleasant. I'm looking forward to this as a regular hangover recovery spot."}
{"text":"Great drinks as always. Just a bit disappointed that when we came in there was only one other person at the bar and I asked the bartender what good infusions did they have and what was good. He tossed a menu at me and told me to read the menu.  I just ordered my usual old fashioned (that was delicious) and brewed."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this spot along E.Carson. It is far and away a better vibe throughout in comparison with the majority of other spots nearby. I was in on a Saturday around noon and had a great BLT from their concise but varied brunch menu. Their selection of beers on tap is strong, and they apparently are specifically known for their fresh fruit infusion in their round house of cocktails.

The service was on point, and I would definitely return for some leisurely afternoon cocktails or dig into and try some of the lunch offerings."}
{"text":"Very short menu.  VERY extensive alcohol list.

Loved the eclectic decor ... especially the real silverware and mismatched plates.

We ordered 2 appetizers: crab avocado dip with toasted bread and pita with pesto, melted mozzarella and balsamic drizzled over it ... we could have made a meal if we doubled these appetizers.

For dinner, we had the smoked pork chop with a radish green apple salad - DELICIOUS ... Bison burger with duck fat fries - DELICIOUS ... and risotto with scallops (note not scallops with risotto ... 2 scallops over a bowl of risotto) - DELICIOUS ...

Initially we ordered the bread pudding & carrots cake for dessert ... they were out ... fate made us order the chocolate chip cookies that are so gooey with hot melted chocolate that you can't dunk them in the accompanying milk.

We already determined ... we will be back."}
{"text":"Got the pork chops and duck tacos along with some delicious cocktails. One of the best bone in pork chops I've had to date! Interior design is done with great taste in a cabin like fashion with a cute little bar in the front."}
{"text":"When a place surprises and delights, it must be shared !  My husband and I stumbled upon this place by chance and we scored !  Food was just as we were seeking. I had baked eggs and loved sopping every last saucy bite with the piece of baguette it came and the fresh greens. My husband had the Carmella's breakfast which was perfectly displayed on a wooden plank everything you'd want for breakfast: scrambled eggs, waffle, thick smoked bacon and spicy sausage all fresh and high quality. Lovely and attentive service, excellent French press coffee and even served in pottery made nearby in Lawrenceville. Beautiful wooden bar, super clean. Will be back to try the many beers on tap!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here and was drawn that they had a \"gluten free menu.\" I ordered the $15.00 breakfast said to include French toast, hash browns, sausage, eggs, bacon and toast.  This particular menu item was labeled \"gf\" but I came to find that all that means is they remove half of the breakfast such as the toast, French toast and hash browns and still charge you the $15.00 total.  All I had was bacon sausage and eggs - feel overcharged and deceived :-/"}
{"text":"went for brunch and enjoyed it. would definitely come back. service was excellent and my Bloody Mary was delicious. peppered bacon is a must here."}
{"text":"we loved the food and the place is great!! I was amazed at the complexity of flavors in each dish but nothing was too weird; the dishes were each unique and really outstanding. 

With three people we had 3 apps and 3 entrees and 2 desserts and all agreed we were full/ satisfied but not unpleasantly stuffed.


The overall decor and vibe is very cool. 

Cocktails are outstanding especially if you like bourbon and scotches."}
{"text":"Tina might be the best bartender in Pittsburgh and would rival anyone in NYC serving up cocktails at Employees Only, The Dead Rabbit or the Nomad Bar. The drinks list is long and creative, the food is no frills and delicious. I highly recommend going on Wednesday, Wild Game night. I had the Elk burger, excellent along with a side of Brussel Sprouts, all very good. Great vibe here as well.."}
{"text":"My nights have led me to this place a few times. The door guy is completely obnoxious and they try to act like a fancy cocktail bar with ridiculous\"dress code\" rules that make me feel more like a high schooler and  less like a 33 year old adult. I was really let down by their cocktails, the menu doesn't have descriptions, just names, and they don't have the ingredients to make the most basic of cocktails. I was excited when this place opened because the Southside needs more cocktail bars and restaurants although its kind of a let down. Hopefully with time they can figure things out and improve upon their services."}
{"text":"Came in at 4 on a Sunday. Place was pretty empty. Waited 7 minutes, the bartender didn't say hi, I'll be with you, make eye contact, NOTHING! We got up and left. What a waste of time!!! Forget this place."}
{"text":"This is one of the south side's hidden gems. Carmella's is our favorite place to go for any kind of celebration or late night treat ourselves. The drinks are fantastic and worth every penny and the food is even better. I religiously get the southside and my boyfriend the penicillin drink and every small dish we have ate was phenomenal. Definitely worth it to check out."}
{"text":"Food was excellent atmosphere was very pretty. We will definitely be returning.  The mojito was perfect and my family had the French press. We went for Father's Day brunch and it was a perfect lunch. Nice waitstaff. Deserts were excellent as well."}
{"text":"So the menu has totally changed and all I have to say is WOW! The food was AMAZING! From the meatball small plate I shared with my husband to the crab bisque... Which was to die for! I also had the scallop main course and my husband had the steak... Both also fantastic. The drink list as usual was on point and the wine list is incredible. Seriously.... This is our favorite place in Southside. The staff is super nice and the atmosphere is great. We just love it there."}
{"text":"Really nice place , great old fashioned \"banana\" if you like sweets, personal is nice and quick too. Nice place to spend your evening actually"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first because the size of the menu is small although I am kind of picky when it comes to certain foods so it's more my problem than theirs Lol. Now with that being said, I will say that I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone. I ordered the Hanger Steak and it was nothing short of fantastic! It tasted amazing and was seasoned perfectly. The fingerling potatoes and peppers were great! Definitely check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been to Carmella's for brunch a few times now, and each experience has been nothing short of excellent.  The service is always warm and friendly, and the food is outstanding.  If you're looking for a good brunch, Carmella's is a solid choice that will always deliver."}
{"text":"Love the environment.  My wife and I are slowly becoming regulars because of the ambience, crowd, and (for me) the whiskey club.  Their whiskey portfolio is extensive.  The food is delicious, but pricey and a tad small for me."}
{"text":"Can't stop praising this place. It is nothing like a typical Southside restaurant. I highly recommend anybody thinking of trying a new place to eat or grab a nice cocktail. It truly should be closer to the Cultural District downtown because I would come here before every show, and for every business meeting. The attention to detail is unparalleled."}
{"text":"I've been to Carmella's a handful of times on the weekends for drinks and loved the atmosphere and service! For my birthday brunch, my friend suggested going to Carmella's for a Sunday brunch because she heard great things about their food. Boy was she right!! 

We had reservations for 5 at 12:30, I arrived a little before everyone and sat at the bar and had a mimosa. The bartender was really nice & she served me right away. Once the rest of our crew arrived, the hostess let us pick if we wanted to sit in the bar area, outside, or in the back room. We chose the back room since it seemed more spacious. Once we were seated, we were quickly approached by our waitress to order drinks & fill us in specials. I still had my mimosa, but the rest of the girls got bloody Mary's and the strawberry-kiwi mojioto. My one girlfriends also tried the Oyster Shooter as her drink- which looked interesting but she liked it! Everyone else loved their drinks!! 

And not a surprise.. everyone also raved about their brunch! I ordered the fritata special of the day which was spinach, feta, & tomatoes. It was also served with cheesy potatoes-which were probably my favorite part of the meal. The fritata was good but looking at the rest of the meals I wish I got what my friends ordered! Others around the table ordered the breakfast sandwich, crab cake Benedict, and another special which was a crab cake BLT. I look forward to another Brunch date to Carmella's!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I stopped in for a drink and were really impressed. The prepared the best Moscow mule i have ever had. My fiance ordered an old-fashioned and also really liked it.

We did not eat here but will be back to try out the food."}
{"text":"Steak tartare was amazing as well as the bison burger. Very cool inside, cabin vibe. I can't wait to come back and check out the rest of the menu! If you're into whiskey this is your place! Or you can pick from the many beers they have on tap. Either way, I will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Great bar great restaurant and great atmosphere. The braised chicken is the best I like it the most?So does the meat board?Delicious?Delicious?Oh?and the cheese cake??"}
{"text":"Dinner for 4 this evening was a delight. We chose simple cocktails which were delivered promptly and the meat and cheese platter, deliciousness! Steaks, scallops, Mac and cheese, salads were all excellent choices. Great ambience, and Carmella is a lovely host. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I think it has a great atmosphere, whether you are looking to have a sit down meal in the restaurant area, or a few drinks by the bar. A traditional/cozy type atmosphere with a wide variety of drinks on the menu. Restaurant menu was different, and a little pricey. The average entree is about $20, but I must say I really enjoyed it. I just didn't expect the price given the location in the middle of Southside. I ordered the seasonal specialty of crab cakes - it was a Friday during lent- and they were fantastic, although I did not care for the garnish that accompanied it. Our table shared some appetizers- Mac n cheese, the cheese board, and the crab and avocado dip- they were all fantastic. I would highly recommend and likely see myself returning!"}
{"text":"We walked in on a rainy Friday night around 7:30PM and were seated immediately.  I really enjoyed the vibe of Carmella's; lighting was a little too dim maybe, but overall it felt genuine and pretty intimate.  It felt like a great use of space.  We sat in the back restaurant section, but we were given the option of sitting in the bar as well.  I wasn't sure if this was an Italian themed restaurant or a lodge so I guess that was a tad bit confusing.

I ordered the hanger steak with yucca fries and I thought it was good - the price was definitely affordable for the taste, I appreciate that as I find some restaurants in Pittsburgh overprice steak simply because it's steak.  The waitresses were friendly and helping at each other's tables.  I wasn't in love with this place, maybe because for the theme the menu felt incredibly limited; however, the service is definitely why I'm giving this place a good rating.  I'd come back to hang out in the bar because I liked the vibe, but not so sure about the food."}
{"text":"Wow, I love this place!  I finally made it for brunch because I kept hearing wonderful things about this place.  Well I was not disappointed!  I got the breakfast sandwich and my companion got the Croque Madamme.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our selections.  His came with  a side of pomme frites and mine came with amazing potatoes, in a fantastic sauce, more of like a Lyonaise potato.  The only thing I didn't eat was the top of the muffin of the sandwich.  It was honestly just much better as an open face sandwich.  I also had a mimosa and it was served with Prosecco and poured and priced just right at $6!  It was more Prosecco and less OJ-just how I like it!  The decor is great in this place now that it has changed ownership and vibes.  I felt as if I was in an old late 1800's/early 1900's saloon in San Francisco during the Gold Rush!  Great fuzzy wallpaper in the back and a great fire place (faux) in the middle of the back space with chairs surrounding it circularly.  Our waitress Dawn was fantastic as well.  Very friendly and knowledgeable about the spot.  I asked her if it was under new ownership and I was happy to hear that Mike from Jekyl and Hyde is the owner, and he named it after one of his long time and dear bartender's Carmella.  I was so happy to hear this because Jekyl was a regular spot for me when I lived in the South Side about 5 years ago.  SInce they used to have live music at Jekyl.  I asked if they had live music here.  Dawn informed me that on Sunday they do have live music and it is often one of Pittsburgh's best musicians (Clinton Clegg of the Commonheart).  This means that Mike is loyal to his talent because Jekyl was the first place I met Clinton and kept coming back on Sunday's for open mic night to hear him.  You guys did a wonderful job with the space and food and I will definitely be back again, and many more times to come!   Bravo!"}
{"text":"I've visited late night for drinks at the bar and also had a brunch here. 3.5-4 stars for late night drinks, 4.5 for brunch. Carmella's has a bar and a couple small tables near the entrance, and a dining area/room in the back with a bunch of tables. They stop serving food at some point in the evening (I forgot what time), but keep serving drinks at the bar. 

Late night drinks: I had their Whiskey Sour and the Paloma. Both were good, but not life-changing. I liked the Whiskey Sour more. I think the main problem for me was that there were some people being rambunctious next to us, and there was really only bar seating which I'm not extremely comfortable with. The bartender was very nice though!

Brunch: I ordered the Scallops Benedict. Highly recommend!! The scallops were cooked perfectly and were a decent size. They were well seasoned and tasted delicious. If you like scallops, you should definitely try it out! The potatoes that came on the side were also delicious. For my drink I had the Mimosa, which was pretty average. Would pass on a drink for my next visit."}
{"text":"Cozy spot with a great draft lineup.  Disappointed with the Bison burger.  It was served on a piece of slate...why?  Burger was really tasty, but I have no idea why you would not at least offer lettuce and tomato.  It needed some cool crunch to cut through the rich meat and savory cheese.  Would have made this burger so much better.  Burger was served with exactly three duck fat fried potato wedges.  These were rich enough that I didn't really need more, but it seemed skimpy for a $14 entree.  Rustic bread with pesto and goat cheese appetizer was obviously so stale that even baking it couldn't save it from crumbling.  That was a real fail.  Ok in a pinch, but probably wouldn't go back for the food.  Beer, yes."}
{"text":"If it's warm out, I can't think of a better place to go on E Carson because it outdoor area gives you such a nice view to go with your drink. Their beer menus are printed on receipts so they're not just people's tabs lying around, just FYI."}
{"text":"Amazing food--ordered the duck breast. My husband got the pork chops. Both specials were outstanding. The Bordeaux tasted like Paris. Excellent service. Do not skip the chocolate chip cookies for dessert! Thrilled that we stumbled upon such a gem."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Me and my husband tried to go somewhere else first and couldn't get a table. We had heard good things about this place, and we decided to try it out. It's not what I thought it would like inside, it's kind of like stepping back in time a little bit, and kind of quirky, I love it. Service was excellent. We weren't left wandering around when we got there, looking very clueless. We were greeted and sat. Our server was on point beginning to end. For starters, we had the burratta, and crab a avocado dip, both VERY good, especially the dip. A dozen oysters, I usually don't like minuet and was almost disappointed that the minuet was served already on the oysters, turns out I just like THEIR minuet. The soup of the day was their award winning mushroom soup, delicious. Then for entrees we had the bison burger, one of the best burgers I've ever had, and the lamb. The lamb could've been a little more tender and moist, but was still a great dish! I can't wait to get some friends to try it out! If you go, get a spicy mango mule!"}
{"text":"Duck tacos. Enough said.

Seriously though, although all the food we had was good, the Duck Confit Tacos were outstanding. We also enjoyed the Mac N Cheese, and crab and avocado dip. I wasn't quite as impressed with the vegetable curry over basmati rice, but it wasn't bad. They have a nice draft beer list (roughly 10 to 15 beers?), and lots of interesting cocktails. I can recommend the Tipperary. All in all a nice place to grab a bite and have a drink with friends."}
{"text":"I loved it here! I had someone recommend Carmella's to me for dinner one time and I didn't think much of it, but we were looking for a brunch spot and after seeing some rave reviews on here, we decided to give it a shot.  Five of us had a reservation on a Sunday afternoon at 1230.  We chose to sit in the back dining area, although the front bar area had some cool high-top tables.  The back dining room is bright and ski-lodgeish.  Does not look like somewhere that would belong in the SouthSide, but was a pleasant surprise and nice change either way.

We started with drinks around the table - a couple bloody marys, mimosas, a mojito and an oyster shooter.  Everyone in the group was pleased.  Our waitress was nice and attentive, while still giving us space to chat and catch up with each other.  I ordered the crab cake benedict which came with their cheesy potatoes and the others ordered the crabcake BLT, frittata, and salmon omelette (on special).  Everyone loved their food!! My crabcake benedict was absolutely incredible and the cheesy potatoes even better.  The price was standard - fell in line with your typical brunch price around the city.  Overall a really great experience.

I'd totally recommend Carmella's for brunch and I would imagine their lunch and dinner is just as good.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time we went here and were not disappointed.  We came for a Saturday brunch (served till 3) I had the bison burger special which was flavorful and presented beautifully on a slate. My partner had the shrimp po boy which was delicious although different than any we've ever had since it was blackened and not with the traditional mayo sauce. Beer selection was excellent - at least 20 taps of great craft beer (I had a free will coffee oatmeal). 
The place is very well appointed with careful attention to every detail.  The cloth napkins are large and tied with a burlap tie. Cooper top tables in the bar are beautiful and the bar area has a great selection of scotch, whiskey and bourbons. 
Will definitely be back again to try dinner."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good service. Would've given a 5 star review but the food was just too weird for me"}
{"text":"We visited for brunch and really enjoyed ourselves. My favorite part of the restaurant was the decor. The attention to detail in terms of the variety of placemats, interesting salt and pepper shakers on the ledge, and pictures on the walls was truly impressive. 

Everyone in the party enjoyed their drinks and meals. I found the bloody mary to be a bit thick and lacking in salt and pepper, but otherwise good. I had the steak & egg tostada. The steak was perfectly cooked and the toppings were deliciously spicy. My husband had the croque madame. It was a large portion and he liked the sandwich and the bread, but found the bechamel sauce to be a little thick. In general, the table found that their dishes needed salt. 

I enjoyed the meal and would definitely like to try dinner at this restaurant next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"I've been to Carmella's on three occasions. The first was when they just opened and I was ignorant to what an amuse-bouche was. They offered to cook me a striped seabass atop a hot rock on my table, and I was a little overwhelmed. 
The second time I went for dinner I had the most delicious pork chop I've had the pleasure of tasting. This was in February for a special Valentine's Day prixe-fixe menu. 
The third time was recently, for brunch, and this is the visit that knocked my socks off and prompted me to start Yelping from the mountaintops (or mount). I had a sausage gravy and biscuits dish with a side of bacon. Simple, yet oh so very delicious. My husband had scallops Benedict and was equally impressed. Their dishes had so much flavor and were just so savory. Perfect brunching! The best part? The coffee. French press, two cups, so smooth. 
Oh, Carmella's, you can cook me brunch anytime you want!"}
{"text":"Good food, drink and service. We came here on a Saturday afternoon and the bar was full but the restaurant was not bad consider it was about 5:30ish. We got seated right away and ordered the braised chicken and strawberry mojido and some other drink. All of them turned out the way we like. One of the drink wasn't sweet enough and the bartender had no problem to bring more syrup. Thrum up to the service and drink.
Food, ok, there are decent. The Korean BBQ taco was good! So does the braided chicken. The Buger we had taste like Big Mac + burgertory! But I mean it in a good way! Worth to try!

The decor there is very interesting, cozy, homie and old fashioned. There are some seats that has a fire place in the middle. Looks cool when they turned it on when it got to later of the night but I didn't see anybody was sitting there. So I am not sure if it would be too much heat. But it is definitely a cool center decor! 

On our way out, I noticed people were lining up waiting to be seated. So either go early like we did or call upfront to make a reservation.

Overall, it was a good experience. I think we would go back."}
{"text":"I came here for a drink, but it was St. Patty's day so all of southside was crazy. We tried to order at the bar, but the bartender was swamped and we were redirected back to our table to wait. We got our orders in, and based on the drink menu, prices ($10+ per cocktail), and the fact that our bartender was wearing a vest and an ivy cap, we figured the craft cocktails would be pretty decent. Unfortunately, they were disappointing, definitely not worth our wait. It was one step up from the usually southside cranberry vodka. I'll give them some slack because it was St. Patty's, but not enough to woo me back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant and they way they accommodated my special request!  From the start, the crab bisque to the end, the warm homemade chocolate chip cookies and milk (nice touch by the way), everything was delicious!

The pork chop was also very, very tasty!  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We had planned on going to Piper's Pub one Saturday night before taking in a movie. Fortunately (you'll find out why it was fortunate soon) Piper's was packed and had a wait too long for us to be able to make the movie. So, we pulled up No Wait, and decided to hit up Carmella's. There was no wait, ha, and we had recently read an excellent review and had planned on trying this place soon anyway. We walked the half block to Carmella's and were seated immediately in the small but lovely dining area. 

It has a rustic feel, with exposed wooden beams, picnic-style wooden tables, and deer heads on the walls. There are what looks to be old family photographs and paintings on the wallpapered walls. Though warm in ambiance, I was a little cold the entire dinner due to sitting directly beneath a vent, but it was a small inconvenience quickly  forgotten  once we began eating. 

The food was amazing. As always, I notified the waitress of my numerous food allergies, and after conferring with the chef she gave me suggestions and alternatives for my dinner (another wonderful experience with a Pittsburgh chef being willing to work with my restraints). I ended up with the smoked pork chop with braised kale and dirty rice. The pork chop was perfectly cooked, and the sauce on top complimented the meat wonderfully. The fatty portions of the pork simply melted in your mouth. The kale came out a bit cold, but it is hard to keep that vegetable warm. The rice was tasty, and made in what I believe was pork fat. My boyfriend started off with the venison kielbasa and kale soup. He enjoyed it, but liked his duck confit tacos much better. The Korean BBQ sauce was spicy and the duck tender. He did note that they were a bit hard to eat on the slate on which they were served, though he did appreciate the careful presentation of the food. We shared an order of the duck fat fries, which were thick and crispy potato wedges (they reminded me of KFC potato wedges somewhat, if KFC cooked in duck fat and didn't let the wedges get soggy). 

For beverages, we each tried one of the classic cocktails listed on their drink menu. While good, they were no where near as unique and complex as those at Bar Marco, Butcher and the Rye, or Tender. But, the clientele in the bar area did not seem like the type to seek out a craft cocktail.  They do have a nice list of wines, available in carafes or by the bottle. The list also includes some PA wines, which is (sadly) not something often seen in local Pittsburgh restaurants. 

Overall, we enjoyed our experience here and look forward to returning soon, hopefully with friends!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch and were excited to try out Carmella's. Unfortunately we did not have a great experience. My wife's food came out at least 10 minutes before mine and was missing one of the components that she ordered. Her breakfast (hash brown bake, eggs and toast) was very average and lacked seasoning. I ordered the crab BLT. It came with under-seasoned hash brown bake. The crab was discolored (grey-brown). It was not very visually appealing. Although our server was very nice, we waited a long time for both our meal and  our check. With so many other places to try, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Best food, drink and Pittsburghs most beautiful people all in one place! Got to get here someday...  Carmella is lovely"}
{"text":"Stopped here last week again.  The cocktails were great - fresh and fun.  We had the Steak Tartare and I can't wait to go back and have it again.  The service was awesome and the environment was cool. I highly recommend it... You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great people. Hands down one of the best restaurant and bars in the city. Just had an incredible dinner for Restaurant Week. Ton of beers on draft, even wine, and really good cocktails. Always can count on Carmella's for a great night out"}
{"text":"Why is this place not talked about more in the Pittsburgh food world?!! Downtown feel in the southside. Stopped in after work for a drink but had to try a couple small plates after looking at their menu. We had The duck confit and Mac and cheese. Both were fantastic. The service was great and the drink that was suggested for me was perfect! I am looking forward to going back to enjoy a relaxed dinner!"}
{"text":"Carmella's is extremely difficult to describe, being a study in contrasts or a jumble of mismatched concepts, depending on your point of view. Start with the name. If the restaurant has 'pints' in its name, Carmella, pure Italian, doesn't fit. It needs an Irish woman's name like Megan or Sinead. 

Next, the decor is an uncomfortable blend of mounted antlered animal heads from a hunting lodge and 1950s photographs and knickknacks from an old Italian grandmother's kitchen. Pretty strange. 

The menu is very limited with only a single burger, scallops, pasta, fish, chicken, and steak offering. We split a wedge salad and chose the chicken and pasta entrees. The food was pretty good, although the chicken was a little over cooked and my pasta portion, while just right for me, might be disappointingly small for many American diners. Prices were quite reasonable. 

We had good Moscow mules and a bottle of Chardonnay. That brings me to the final mismatch, the wine. The wine list includes very few moderately priced items. There are many interesting, higher priced wines that would be more suitable for a more upscale restaurant. Furthermore, one of the reasons we came on a Monday was to take advantage of the half price wine promotion. However, it applies only to wines under $50, which are almost nonexistent. With the assistance of our excellent server we found a way to participate. 

Service was outstanding even though there was a single server who had to cover the mostly empty restaurant and the outside tables.

Overall it was a pretty good experience and so I rounded up to 4*. The bar was large and attractive. Looks like a good place for a drink."}
{"text":"I've been to Carmella's a few times now and always love it. Today I went from brunch with a friend and it was great. They have a variety of typical brunch drinks ranging $6-$10 and fresh pressed coffee, which was delicious. My friend got the scallops Benedict and I got the classic brunch plate vegetarian style. My plate was $15 and came with fluffy scrambled eggs, cheesey potato hash browns, toast with butter and jam, French toast (deep fried), and a sliced apple. If you get it with meat, for the same price, you also get sausage and bacon. It was a huge plate and delicious. The potatoes were to die for. I easily could have split my meal alone with 2-3 people. They have a nice atmosphere a little too dark for my personal preference and the front windows/wall all open up onto Carson street, which is nice on warm days."}
{"text":"This is a cool joint. I like a lot. Good selection of booze. I didn't try the food. 

The bar maid was super friendly and helpful. Everyone else seemed to not be able to help. 

I got a table and still had to hit the bar. One guy behind the bar couldn't serve me but seemed to spend a lot of time being there. 

The place is cool service isn't"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I finally came to Carmella's after passing it many times. I think we were under the impression that it was a little on the pricey side...we were wrong.

We split the veal and burrata appetizer. Both were delicious! The pesto that comes with the burrata and the red sauce with the veal were very tasty. For our meals, I had the duck tacos and he had the steak. I really enjoyed the tacos. The korean style gave them a sweet taste, but not too sweet! You get 3 tacos- I was full with all the food! His steak had a nice spice rub with a kick to it!

I really enjoy the decor/cabin fever of Carmella's! The staff was very nice and gave great recommendations! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for a happy hour recently. We waited about 10 minutes before anyone even came to our table. My girlfriend got the meet and cheese plate. She said the cheeses were too harsh. The Meats were pretty good though. I just had some rum and cokes which were fine and she had wine. For the price and service I probably wouldn't go back.. but I wouldn't say I never would. I may give them another shot. The ambience was pretty cool, and they have tons of Whiskey, although I'm not a huge whiskey fan..."}
{"text":"I have a gift.  A special talent.  If I love a dish, the restaurant immediately takes it off the menu.  If you want to get rid of a dish, just make it delicious and serve it to me.      

In all seriousness though, Carmella's is a old favorite that has just not been living up...hence a prior five star review down to three.   It's been a slow decline, but the last several visits weren't up to snuff at all...and that has made things I previously overlooked (ahem...I'm talking about you, uncomfortable bar stools) more obvious and more annoying.  I've also noted a gradual decline in the value too.  What used to be a half off happy hour is now 25% off small plates.  That's fine - I am willing to pay for quality, but I want to get it consistently and I just haven't been.   Here are a couple examples of some other recent visits.

About a month ago, I showed up looking for my beloved tuna poke.  It's bright and fresh and light and sometimes just the dinner I need.  The roe is a nice addition and makes it superior to other poke options around town.  I got a glass of wine and settled in to order, only to be told that the July 4 special menu was in effect.  No poke on that menu.  Nevermind that it wasn't actually the 4th.  The bartender basically acted like I was lucky they bothered to open at all on the day before a holiday, and then served me some mac and cheese (sans the bacon I'd asked for) on a plastic plate.  Ok fine.  Whatever.   I'll give you the holiday excuse.   

Tonight's visit was dubbed \"we don't have that\".  FIVE times in the course of one dinner, I had to hear \"we don't have that\".   Two different kinds of liquor, usually in stock, were not available.  Merlot?   Not by the glass and not a bottle less than $50 either.  The bruschetta I so loved...replaced by an inferior burrata.  Tuna Poke (arguably the best small plate in the house)...sorry, not tonight.  And PS, don't come back for it, because they're taking it off menu altogether.   Dessert...again, a chosen option was not an option.   The menu is currently a big tease.  Overall, the food was good, though $18 got one of us two small scallops and some undercooked risotto.   The real problem was that no one really got what they wanted, because they didn't have it.   

Rest In Peace, tuna poke.  I will miss you."}
{"text":"Loved the rich selection of food and drink in this cozy setting. Quite a relief from the typical places seen on the southside. Mac and cheese was Amazing. Really good food that feels like home."}
{"text":"While visiting Pittsburgh, my fiancé and I had dinner at Carmella's. Right away we were impressed with the remodel remembering the old dive bar it used to be. We started with Austin Mules at the bar while we waited for our table (the restaurant was reserved for a rehearsal dinner). These were the best tasting mules! The bartender told us they use fresh lime juice and it really made all the difference. We were sat shortly after the large party cleared out and ordered our appetizers, the Devilsh Eggs and the Crab Avocado Dip. The apps came quickly especially considering the entire restaurant sat at the same time. Both appetizers were excellent! I ordered the Duck Confit Tacos and he ordered the Smoked Pork Chop with Risotto. The tacos were just divine and I wished I could savor the flavor forever. My fiancé's pork chop was perfectly cooked and the risotto was delicious. For dessert we had the chocolate-filled churros with bananas and bread pudding ice cream and ate every last bite. The staff was all very friendly and the owner, Carmella, was incredibly attentive, stopping by our table several times to make sure our experience was going well. I mean this when I say, from start to finish, this was the best meal I HAVE EVER HAD!! If we didn't already have dinner plans I would've been happy eating at Carmella's every night of my trip. If you're in Pittsburgh visiting or live there, this is a must. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful and I can't wait to go back to try more food. Unfortunately, we went there when we'd had a VERY big lunch at a party. Almost everything on the menu looked delicious and the prices were reasonable. Plus, it's a bar that's NON SMOKING in South Side!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely perfect! The drinks were magnificent and the food was just as great. We will be back for the happy hour food! The drink specials are great. Looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"Food nerd from brooklyn here, this place is legit, the pesto pasta with the scallops was sublime, duck confite tacos are great, ask Page for obscure mezcal and you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"One of the more unique places in southside.  It is a nice change of pace from the standard bars on Carson.  The atmosphere is darker and has a speakeasy type vibe.  

They have a ton of different liquor and drink options to choose from.  The bartenders are all helpful and provide great service.  

The food here is also very good.  While the menu is limited, they make sure to do each dish perfectly.  My favorite thing on the menu is the bison burger.  The ingredients are all fresh and work great together.  The burger is served on a fresh brioche bun which holds up well against the toppings and sauce of the burger.  The burger is always cooked exactly to order as well.

Definitely a place to check out if you want something outside the usual southside experience."}
{"text":"Awesome food, amazing drinks, and attentive staff!  We came here for my friend's birthday, and we could not have picked a better place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been to Carmellas and always talked about it. We decided to spend my birthday eve here. They have a great mix of cocktails. The atmosphere and vibe are very relaxing and inviting. The cocktail menu was a tad confusing for me. I went with a basic sangria which was great. We sat at a table in the bar area and it was fun. Bartender/server was nice and made us feel welcomed. She also suggested drinks for our next visit after I had mentioned i wasn't familiar with cocktail menu 

On my actual birthday we decided to stop in to celebrate restaurant week. Hostesses kindly made sure to fit us in whenever we called ahead. She mentioned a 30 minute wait but we received a text in about 15min. I preferably didn't care for their pre fixe menu and we decided on a small plate..... and then dinner somewhere else.

 We were seated around the fireplace which was very different experience but cool. Perfect for january. Service was good as well as the duck tacos I had.

This may be our go to spot when we're looking for something to do, but not an actual club. Wine & Motown? yes please! Not many places on E Carson play Marvin Gaye on a Saturday night. 

The crowd was a mix of all ages 25 & older. Cute bar. I intend to experience their brunch soon!!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Pittsburgh! Fatheads is mediocre compared to them even tough Carmella's have only one on the menu."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are excellent here. They use fresh, local ingredients too which I thought was awesome. Sat at the fire place table which was nice and cozy for the gf and myself on a cold winter night. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place has been so hit or miss with me.  I've never eaten here, but had cocktails quite a few times.  The crowd can get a little douchey on the weekends, which is a shame since it's such a classy atmosphere.  The drinks are delicious, but they are pricey.  I prefer Dish for an upscale cocktail in the Southside."}
{"text":"What an absolute find in the South Side. Great booze selection, wonderful Bloody Mary. I still want to brave the SS on Saturday night, but I could easily be a regular here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and drink options are great. I think their food menu could use some work though. We went there for dinner and they seem to have several great options but they're kind of limited in normal/boring options. I know that sounds weird but it would be nice to have a regular burger option in case you are feeling a little less adventurous that day instead of bison burgers, scallops, etc... those things are sometimes great but sometimes a person in the group just wants something normal. Again, I totally get how weird that sounds. 
We also went for brunch later in the weekend with out of town guests and again, they just try too hard to be fancy. I got the Carmella's breakfast which is basically a giant breakfast with almost anything you would want. Some of those items include bacon which is over-peppered and home fry type things smothered in cheese. Bacon and home fries are already really good without trying to overdo them by smothering them in seasoning or cheese. Also, why does this meal need waffles AND toast? Most people only need one bread item for breakfast and this is overdoing it. The waffles were fine though as were the eggs. I didn't eat the sausage because I don't think anyone needs to eat sausage and bacon for breakfast and I didn't eat the huge piece of melon because I hate honeydew as do most people. If you want to serve fruit, maybe serve something a lot of people like like berries, watermelon, etc. I hate when restaurants serve honeydew/cantaloupe. I really feel like they only serve it because it's super cheap. Anyway, those are my thoughts. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great."}
{"text":"I have a lot of friends who like this place, and I have no idea why.

First of all, the food isn't very good. I came last week after hearing they had a new chef, and the steak was tiny for $20-something, plus absolutely doused in salt. The cauliflower and quinoa is also a mess, just not tasty at all. My date got a bolognese that wasn't great either, though he thought it was ok.

Second of all, the bartender talked primarily to my date, and I found that to be pretty rude. I wear an engagement ring and I think it was pretty clear we were together -- why she found it necessary to ask him if he had been there before, if he liked the food, and if he needed more to drink but not me any of those questions is beyond me. It's like sales 101, no matter what you're dealing: talk to the woman or you're toast! 

Third, it's loud and crowded on Fridays and Saturdays -- expensive enough for a date place but no ambiance for a date on those nights.

***I downgraded this to one star from two stars after someone who I assume is affiliated in some way with the restaurant sent me a nasty Yelp message for my review that I just noticed. If it happens again I will get my friends who strongly dislike it here to write their own one-star reviews also."}
{"text":"I love this place. The woman and I go here usually twice a month. The decor is rustic and eclectic, the service is on point everytime and they usually have one heck of a jolly host greeting you at the door. Carmella's is a staple in Pittsburgh list of places to must eat."}
{"text":"I ordered the Smoked Pork Chop with Potato & Chorizo Hash / Cranberry Bourbon Glaze / Cider Gastrique / Apple & Pomegranate Salad. The pork chop had many good reviews and this sounded good to me. Unfortunately, the Chef cremated the pork chop. It was so overdone, I really had a hard time eating it. The server immediately asked if I wanted something else, but I declined. I was hungry  and I didn't realize at the time just how dried out it really was. I also didn't realize that the chorizo hash was extremely salty and the cranberry bourbon glaze was sickly sweet. I would not ever order the pork chop again even if it were cooked perfectly. 

So how could I possibly put 4 stars on this restaurant you might rightfully ask? First off, it was huge that my server asked how my dinner was at the perfect moment after I had time to try it, but not ages after it arrived. I definitely could have sent this back and probably received something else pretty quickly. Clearly a lot of other folks have enjoyed this pork chop. Secondly, I loved the atmosphere-the music-the friendliness of the bartender and other patrons. Lastly, my dinner was comped. I ordered the wrong thing (for me) on the wrong night. I will definitely be back. I fully anticipate a 5-star experience the next time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in the Burgh to hang out with friends and enjoy an old fashioned."}
{"text":"I had no idea that this place even existed.  I am normally very anti-South Side because I do not like the feel of the normal South Side place.  This place does not have the South Side feel at all.  My sister and brother-in-law found this on a Friday night because they were looking to avoid the crowded college feel and they loved it.  We went back for Saturday Brunch.  We were not disappointed.  We got a carafe of Bloody Marys and were very impressed.  They do a black pepper and garlic infused vodka which worked very well.  You also get a mini appetizer (shrimp, olive, pickle and cheese) as the garnish.  The carafe produces 4 Bloody Marys and is a great deal.  The menu is small, but there is something for everyone.  We had one Vegan in the group and they made her a delicious Vegan plate (not on the menu.)  We all shared most of the food and we had: the bison burger, the omelet of the day, sausage biscuits and gravy the pork hash and the breakfast/brunch board.  Everyone loved their food.  The bison burger had great flavor and was very juicy.  The omelet was cooked perfectly and you could just tell that the eggs were very fresh.  The sausage biscuits were very light; not the heavy gravy that you get at a lot of places.  You could also really taste the sage.  The hash was flavorful and the sunny side eggs were cooked perfectly.  The breakfast/brunch board had a great variety.  We were impressed with the sausages and the waffles.  We sat in the back for brunch.  The décor is very unique and there is a lot to see.  The re-use their liquor bottles as vases and candle holders.  We then moved to the bar after brunch for cocktails.  The bar is very unique,  They use 1/2 barrels as the backs to the tap system.  They have a very diverse collection of tequila, bourbon, scotch and whisk(e)y.  My husband has the Moscow Mule and he said it was great.  I also had their Old Fashion and it was perfect.  This is defiantly a place that we will be back  to and will recommend.  There were six of us and no one had a bad time or was unhappy with anything.  There is a parking lot right next door as well."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is indeed like a cool hunting lodge as others have said, though the legs on the tables in the back are so thick that it makes leg room a bit awkward. The staff is great - knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, totally on-point. Half-price bottles of wine on Mondays. All apps we ordered were great - the meat plate, the deviled eggs, duck tacos, yum. Hanger steak, tender and delicious with the chimichurri, and braised chicken - delicious sauce - both excellent. This place completely exceeded my expectations and I will be back."}
{"text":"Carmella's is simply fabulous. I've never had bad food, drinks, service or a bad experience here. This is one of my favorite places in South Side to grab a drink. I am definitely addicted to the banana bourbon! 

During my most recent visit, the hubs and I shared two appetizers - the crab & avocado and the smoked provolone wheel. For our entrees, I had the seared scallops and he had the bison burger. My scallops were perfect. 

Carmella's is great for date night as well as large parties. I've been with a group of 20+ here, and Carmella's is more than accommodating."}
{"text":"Food was delicious (devil's eggs were awesome!), cocktails tasty, great music, cozy decor.  Minor quirks (it was kind of odd when the promo girls from the bar wondered into the dining room).  Overall great experience, will visit again."}
{"text":"This bar is such a diamond in the rough!!!  A shining example of exactly how you slowly develop into an establishment everyone needs to frequent. Their beer selection is wide and varied, their spirits are top notch and their menu is absolutely mouth watering. Our server Jaime was incredible, her service and recommendations were perfect.  I hope that others will come to experience this place and their greatness, and not just the drunken degenerates that roam east Carson like zombies"}
{"text":"Sometimes I get so mad at myself for missing out on things - and Carmella's falls into that category.  How I just stumbled upon this gem now is beyond me, but I will right this wrong and return soon and likely frequently.

My friend and I were walking along East Carson killing time before we went to dinner and by chance popped into Carmella's.  We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by a very friendly and extremely knowledgeable bartender who schooled my friend on the various fruit infused vodkas and different options for cocktails.  I just went straight to the WINE ON TAP!  This, my friends, is no box of wine, but free flowing crisp fresh wine from a tap.  And, bonus, it was happy hour so it was 25% off.

Due to our prearranged dinner plans elsewhere we only ordered an appetizer - the fried deviled eggs.  The serving was two eggs, each sliced, allowing us each our own egg.  I enjoyed it but would have liked a little more of the sauce that was on the plate.  It was served on two cute little antique plates that you'd be most familiar from your Grandma's set of dishes.  

The atmosphere here is great.  The bartender described the owner's style as \"American Picker\" and that was dead on.  Everywhere you look you'll find a cute little accent and treasure on the wall or perched on a shelf.  

The dinner menu isn't very big but I have no doubt each dish is prepared wonderfully.  I can't wait to come back and stay longer."}
{"text":"I was riding my bike around south side and decided to stop into Carmella's. The first thing you notice when walking in is the attention that was paid to the interior. Wood is everywhere and you kind of feel like you're in a camping lodge. It's really quite cozy. 

The place was empty and I was alone and in a hurry so I sat at the bar, hoping to get the steak tartare I saw on their menu. It turned out to be brunch so I was a little bummed that I wasn't going to get the tartare but brunch on a Saturday is hard to come by so I was also excited. I ordered the baked eggs. It took some time for my order to come and I feared that the eggs were sitting. I was right. They were rock hard and the tomato sauce was pretty pretty generic. There was a little spinach and beet salad on the side that was a little bit on a saving grace but not enough. I usually don't sent things back and was pretty tight on time. However, I should have said something in this case. I ascribe my disappointing meal to a slow shift and a lazy waitress. That's not to say she was a bad waitress. I was once there and the slowest shifts are the hardest to care about good service sometimes. I didn't like the eggs but the salad gave me the confidence to say that I would give Carmella's another shot. Side note, the music sucked. It didn't go with the ambiance of the restaurant at all and should definitely be changed in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm loving Carmella's! Great atmosphere and a good variety of beer and wine on tap! Great space on Carson that doesn't have the college crowd."}
{"text":"Fun great NEW bar to hangout at with friends there's 60 beers on tap lots of muisc on the junkbox TV's ect .. And the owner is a sweet heart heart.. U have to check this place out.. O.. And they have good coming soon in July"}
{"text":"Very good bar 
with Incredible selection of alcohol 
I stop by with my friends to try this place
we just drink and be honest with you I like it 
I didn't try food ,maybe next time 
but drinks there goood."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch spot! The Carmella's Breakfast and mimosas were delicious. Such a cute, rustic setting. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Carmella's deserves a 5 star in every category: Food, Drinks, Ambience & Service! I went to dinner there last night with 5 friends. We each ordered a different drink, appetizer and meal. Not a single complaint! 

Here are the deets:

Drinks: Carmella's offers liquor infusions!! They change every few months, depending on what Carm & her staff invent. Last night, we tried the pineapple vodka and cherry vodka. Both over ice and very flavorful. We also ordered the Moscow mule and an Old Fashioned. The Moscow mule was delicious, components were well balanced and appropriately served in a copper mug. The Old Fashioned had a solid kick but strong orange pull that gave it a nice finish. We also ordered a bottle of their Terredora Dipaolo Anglinico 2012 red wine. Bold vanilla and cherry flavors. It pairs well with any and all meat dishes.

Food: Appetizers- Steak Tar Tar, Hummus, Duck confit tacos
Entrees- Gnocchi, Arugula & Beet salad, Pork Chop with Grits, Shrimp Linguine, NY Strip with flavor fries (large cut wedges)
The portion sizes were generous for all the dishes. 
Steak Tar Tar- excellent taste and presentation! served with fries which was a nice change
Hummus served with carrots and celery by request. Heavy paprika but delicious! 
Duck confit tacos- fantastic! Add the lime juice! All together, the lime and kimchi created a unique flavor. 
The Gnocchi with meat sauce was non standard in presentation however, it remained true to the traditional dish and the beef flavor held very well in the sauce. 
Arugula Salad with Beets was crisp and fresh, I couldn't ask for anything more. 
Pork Chop portion was large and grits had a strong butter cream base. Great pair!
NY Strip- also great portion size and prepared well. Simple presentation with the flavor fries.
Shrimp linguine- I'm always a fan when shrimp dishes include ample amounts of large shrimp and this dish did not disappoint! 

Dessert- we opted for chocolate stout and coffee with Baileys and Jameson!

Ambience- stained glass windows, antique pieces throughout the restaurant and a fireplace with seating for 8 in the middle of the room. Dark lighting & high ceilings with exposed brick. 

Service: Waitress was knowledgable & attentive. Made great suggestions and helped our guests with food allergies order the right dishes. 

Make reservations for a Saturday night and go often! SS was in desperate need of a place like this!!"}
{"text":"My beet risotto with scallops was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"From making the reservation to paying the check...everything about Carmella's was WONDERFUl.  The brunch menu was varied and creative, handcrafted cocktails, great beer list and the prices were right on target.  The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming and the music is fun and at just the right level to enjoy, but not to intrude on conversation.  The team...all family...Ben, Tina and Carmella we're terrific.  The service was excellent and we had a chance to chat for awhile with Carmella, who had also just finished the half marathon and was absolutely delightful.  Carmella's is a treasure and anytime you are visiting Pittsburgh, you must make it your business to visit this gem on Carson in the Southside!  Thanks Ben, Tina and Carmella, we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Cool place.  Warm inviting environment. Lots of beer selections.  Had the bison burger, scallops, and crab/avocado dip.  All were fantastic.  Lemon cheesecake was great too.  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to Carmella's for dinner tonight. We had reservations but it really wasn't necessary. It was wild game Wednesday and my fiance got an elk burger. We both agreed it was the best burger we have ever eaten. Between the cook on the burger and the truffle aioli, it was absolutely melt in your mouth delicious! My wild boar bolognese was just the right mix of gamey and elegant. We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I went here for restaurant week and was really impressed!  There was a little bit of a mix up regarding our reservation but they were able to straighten it out and accommodate us within 10 minutes of arrival.  We sat at the round communal table around the fire which was quite warm and cozy (them almost a little too warm after awhile there!) . I sampled a couple of cocktails which were both excellent, and had the mushroom soup with the fried skate and the lemon ricotta cheesecake.  Everything was fantastic, portions were generous, and the presentation was beautiful.  All items also came out pretty quickly and the server was attentive.  I also loved the cozy ambiance and it was nice that the busier bar area was separate dining room. 

The only awkward part when I first arrived is that there was this random guy standing outside a few feet in front of the front door in a winter fur trapper hat who was trying to talk to me from like 10 feet away as I was waiting outside for my friend (saying things like \"hey there!\" and I thought he was a random guy trying to hit on me or something.  When I started to walk in the restaurant I tried to just walk past him thinking he was just hanging out there when he then asks for my ID.  But he did not seem very professional and did not wear any sort of uniform or name badge so I found this rather sketchy, especially given that this was only 7pm and this is a nicer restaurant, not like a late night bar or club scene, at least not at that hour.  But besides that everything was a great experience."}
{"text":"I have been to Carmella's more times than I would like to admit. I love everything about this place. The atmosphere, the service, the delicious food, & the stellar cocktails. Everything is on point. 
My most recent visit was for a friend's birthday and we sat at the tables across from the bar. They do have a dining room in the back. The hostess is located after the bar. This time I had the Seared Scallops and the fiancé had the bison burger. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the risotto they came on was delicious. My fiancé loved his burger and it was cooked to a perfect medium. 
They do infused vodkas and I highly suggest having a cocktail made with one. It's so good. If you're looking for more of a snack they have some tasty smalls plates. I love both their meat board and the cheese one. 
The staff is always on top of everything and so friendly. 
If you are looking for a great place to meet up with friends or a date night Carmella's is an amazing choice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just happened to stumble upon this place one night and they did not disappoint! Cool atmosphere, great waitstaff, and fantastic food! It's been 3 months since we've visited and we are still raving about the steak! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you want to watch a Pens game after a Steelers playoff win, go elsewhere. There's only one t.v. and they wouldn't change it from the Packers/Giants playoff game. There's plenty of space in this bar where they could fit a second t.v. If you're going to have one, you should have it tuned to the 'Burgh teams."}
{"text":"This is such an awesome addition to the Southside!! 

Ambiance is great - cool and relaxing.  Service is just what I like, educated about the menu, around when you need them and not too overbearing.

Drinks are creative and delicious.  I love their Moscow Mule.

Dinner is awesome!  I've been to both Meat & Potatoes and Butcher & Rye, which have a similar vibe, and this is just as good if not better.  The meat and cheese platter is stacked with great options and I seriously still dream about the scallop and risotto dish.  

Only reason I docked them a star was I tried brunch recently.  Their brunch menu is new, but could use some work.  I got baked eggs and they were BAKED and not in a good way, just way overcooked.  Friend got the Biscuits and Gravy which was huge, but nothing amazing.  I just think their are better brunch spots in Pittsburgh.  Mimosa and Bloody Mary's were good though!

Overall, skip brunch until they get the menu worked out.  Definitely go for dinner and drinks.

Still dreaming of the scallops..."}
{"text":"It's nice setting, really expensive, but great for one of two specialty drinks but can't stay the whole night.  Have not had food yet. Will soon."}
{"text":"Delicious! The staff was friendly and accomodating, and the food was spectacular. Portions aren't giant but don't leave you hungry either. Check the specials before you order. The poached duck with cherry sauce needs to be on the menu. Overall fantastic drinking and dining experience. 5/5 would hit up again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant and bar is at a great location on Carson street in the Southside. We started here for dinner before going out for the evening.  It's close to lots of bars if you plan on bar hopping. 

They've got a few small tables out on the sidewalk if it's a nice day. The first room you'll walk into houses the bar area. We were seated in the back room and the decor is super cool. Definitely different than your typical restaurant.  Looking around the room you'll see animal heads and antique photos on the walls. 

The food menu isn't too extensive. For dinner entrees, there's about 10 options including specials with the minimum costing you about $15. The beer and drink list is much more extensive. I was only drinking beer and each craft will be at least $6. I ended up eating the boar burger which was one of the specials. It's a pork burger topped with bbq pulled pork. I've never had one before and it was delicious. Your mind expects the consistency of a burger but it's a bit tougher and cooked to a different temperature. Check this place out for something different and maybe try one of their specials!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice addition to Pittsburgh. Since I have moved from here there has been an influx of foodie type restaurants in Pittsburgh. This one had kind of a log cabin feel with a bar when you first walk in. The greeter at the door was dressed the part with his fur hat and long coat. All the way in the back is a seated restaurant area. I would recommend either having reservations or putting your name on the wait list in advance. There was a fire pit in the middle of the room with a table around it. For appetizer I ordered a winter salad and it was a nice size and not too much dressing. It had a nice sweet flavor. I ordered the old fashioned drink. It was pretty strong but i liked it. Our waiter was good, we just told him to pick drinks for us because we couldn't decide. He did a good job because he just asked what flavors we liked and he delivered something we liked. I liked how this was a farm to table place. I got their special elk burger with blue cheese and sweet potato fries. I thought the burger was great and flavorful. The portions were a nice size and not overwhelming. I was eyeing the pumpkin seasonal dessert but I was full. I would come back again to try other things."}
{"text":"Well color me thoroughly impressed! I stopped here for Restaurant Week and I've been raving about it since.  

We were seated around the communal fireplace. This was nice and cozy, but after awhile I had to check to make sure my eyebrows weren't singed off. My face was hot! Decor is eclectic and homey. It's like you're in a fancy mountain cabin. 

My restaurant Week picks included:
Roasted Onion Soup with Lamb Bacon- this was light, creamy and so very flavorful. 

Fried Skate with Heirloom Tomato Salad, Potato Chip Tartar Sauce, Crispy Capers, and Grilled Lemon- this was honestly the best fried fish dish I've ever eaten. The batter was super crispy, but it wasn't greasy at all. The whole dish was actually very light with bright flavors (words I've never used to describe fried food before). Great acid and spice. I'd eat this again and again forever.

Lemon Ricotta Cheesecake with Warm Berry Compote, Caramel Drizzle, Shaved White Chocolate and Candied Garnish- I was a little worried that this was going to be TOO much with a whole 'lotta flavors all over the place. But it was delicious. I love everything lemon and the lemon really shone through. I cleaned my plate with little to no effort.  

Portions were perfect, the plating was beautiful, and at 25.17 a person, the restaurant week specials were a fantastic deal. I'll be back to order off the regular menu for sure."}
{"text":"Spending the weekend in downtown Pittsburgh? This is your MUST STOP bar. 

Carmella's was recommended to use by our waiter at another establishment and it set the bar extremely high on venue quality, service, variety, and overall curb appeal. 

The bar hosts a variety of Whiskeys, Wines (bottle and tap), and beer (local, out of state, draft, and bottle). This is a great change of pace from some of the more specific beer and hard liquor bars on the lane. There is something for everyone here.

The value is there and venue has an open layout with a large window looking out to the street. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable on the beer/wine being served which was a huge selling point for us in picking a drink. 

If you find yourself on Carson Street, you must stop here."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic.   The first time my husband and I stopped here was last winter.   We sat at the bar and the coziness of the wood and fireplace made it so warm and welcoming on a cold afternoon.  We most recently went there for dinner last night with friends and it has the same appeal on a warm September evening.  First, let's talk about the cocktails.  They have a very nice list of originals and classics, all of which are expertly executed.  Also, their selection of scotches and tequilas is huge!  Now, let's talk about their food.  Their food is out of this world.  I've had the hanger steak, scallops and many other things and every time, it's delicious.  It's just the right amount of artisan and regular food.  Finally, their service is friendly and fast.  I would highly recommend this place for a drink, many drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"Adorable atmosphere. I would absolutely be a regular at this bar if I lived nearby. Our server and bartender who kept bringing our drinks were both so sweet and attentive. Manmosa is where its at! Blue moon with OJ & mandarin vodka. It was like a spiked mimosa?? Yum!

Bloody Mary was pretty watered down but I think it's because they used house tomato juice, effort appreciated. Also came garnished with a big ole shrimp - tasty!

Unfortunately, caught up in the St. Patty's Day festivities, they weren't offering their normal menu, only a specialty one for the day. Food was hit or miss; specialty omelet needed more basil and more mozz... the ends of the omelet had no filing at all, just dry egg :-/ But homefries were really yummy and beau said his duck tacos were some of the best he's had. Beau's sister's baked eggs were not her favorite. It was eggs [over]baked in a skillet of tomato sauce.... but she said the flavor was good.

Anyway, their heart was in the right place - we all loved the service, environment, and drinks. I'd definitely come back to chill and sip drinks at the bar and try something off their regular menu."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are great. Service is not very nice though. Table assignment for drinks is random--sometimes they say reserved but they will seat you, others not."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Southside bar! It's great on a warm night to be able to sit in their sidewalk seating area and cozy to sit around the fireplace for brunch on a cold winter day. I've visited for brunch, happy hour, dinner, and late night drinks and all have been enjoyable. They have a big draught selection and the wine on tap has some delicious varieties. 

I have had the chili and the hamburger from the dinner menu, and both were delightful.

The breakfast sandwich on the brunch menu is a winner. Couple that with a mimosa and you are off to a great Saturday!"}
{"text":"I will probably try it again based on reviews it's gotten on yelp, but was not particularly impressed on my first visit. Came for lunch with two people. We were the only people in the restaurant. Service was friendly, but really really slow. The menu was really limited.... I think maybe five items! All of themnpretty esoteric. Two of us had the tuna. It was good,. And contrary to popular opinion I found the interior to be rather dusty anddepressing."}
{"text":"We went here with a group of 20 for New Year's Eve and a few of the group had dietary restrictions, so we were a challenging group for a restaurant. They served us well and with a smile, and the food was excellent across the board. I'd love to go back with a smaller group and try it again."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last night, and loved it just from walking through the door! The food was phenomenal, the drinks were great and the staff were friendly! We had some bourbon and a jalapeño strawberry margarita, which was the best I've ever had! I got a burger special called the Pig Mac, and crushed the entire thing. It was great. The other food we ordered was amazing too! This place knows what they're doing, and we will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was extremely rude and biased to me and my fellow patrons for standing on their sidewalk which is public property. When trying to come in they locked the door at 1 am with other patrons still inside. There is no sign about loitering, public trespassing and than locked the door during hours. So unprofessional for trying to gain business. I wish I could give this place negative."}
{"text":"Loved this little restaurant/bar! 
First of all, this is a perfect date night spot for dinner and drinks! It's really cute inside and has amazing drinks and food! We went on a Saturday night around 7 without a reservation but were able to be seated at the round fireplace in a very short time. 
I ordered the Southside cocktail and it was so refreshing! For food, we had boar meatballs and the bison burger, omg both were amazing! I was tempted with the cookies and milk dessert when I saw another guest enjoying it and am glad I got it! The cookies were served warm with a cute little teacup of milk, a perfect ending to a great meal!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that an establishment like this exists in Pittsburgh!  The ambiance is very cozy but sophisticated and feels like a place you can have a nice conversation or enjoy a fun -- but not raucous -- time with a group of friends.  Definitely a very welcome departure from the usual Carson Street experience.

Their bar program is pretty awesome. They have a bunch of whiskeys and wines on tap, which is something I've so far seen mostly in bigger cities, and a very decent selection of craft beers as well. The cocktails are *excellent* - strong, balanced, not too sweet.  I enjoyed a tasty manhattan and boulevardier and would not hesitate to try any of their other cocktails on a future visit.

I was perhaps most excited for the new chef's food, having eaten and LOVED the food at Uchi in Austin.  We tried the deviled eggs, the lamb meatball, the sausage on a stick, and the deconstructed carrot cake.  All were tasty, but the deviled eggs and the sausage were absolutely stand-out dishes.  The sausage came on what looked like a real tree branch glazed so that it could support the food.  I probably could have done without the carrot cake, maybe the deconstruction was a little too much for my tastes.

We sat at the bar initially and the service was excellent there. When asked for recommendations, the bartender was very honest about which dishes were his favorite. Based on the broad sampling we ended up having, he was spot on. After our group grew and we moved to a table, the service became a little more erratic (though still totally pleasant -- just not super organized).

Overall, this is a fantastic place and I only wish it were in Lawrenceville so I could roll down Butler Street to get there!"}
{"text":"As other reviewers have mentioned, the ambiance of Carmella's is awesome--it's very wild west/general eclectic. They even have a real fire pit in the middle of one of the tables! Service is efficient and friendly, and they have a wonderful drink selection--Carmella's is a place I suggest when I know my group includes beer, wine and liquor drinkers. Their wine by the glass is always good because they keep it on draft (I think). My favorite is the Hahn GSM blend (try it--you won't be disappointed!). The reason Carmella's doesn't get five stars is because the food is inconsistent. I have had some items I love and others that are downright awful and have even had a mixed experience ordering the same item (bison burger) on two different visits with it being great one day and meh the next time I ordered it. The bar area is fairly spacious, but tends to get crowded. They have a small patio out front to sit on during nice weather, but it's small, so don't count on getting to sit outside. The dining room is pretty big, but some of the tables are cramped and uncomfortable, while others make for a super cozy dining experience. 

TL;DR: 5 stars for drinks/ambiance/service, 3 stars for food."}
{"text":"This place has a heavy, ugly atmosphere that is also cheap - the quality of the wood and its lamination on the tables is waxy. 

I've been a few times out of convenience, as I live in the area and it's always empty - the French toast is very big and sweet. The coffee is terribly over-roasted. The waiters are uninformed. Service is slow and unprofessional. The menu is trashwave - unsophisticated takes on sophisticated dishes, for those who like their food at least in part either deeply fried or entirely sugar, served almost warm. I felt it merited a solid 3 stars(for mediocre food and bad atmosphere) until my last visit, where the waitstaff or the waitstaff and kitchen in cahoots delivered to my analysis a new low.

The last time I will have ever been there, I asked if the tacos had any vegetable oil in them. The waiter went to the kitchen, \"to ask the chiefs\", and returned with an answer - \"no.\"

I received my tacos (bland, meatball of some kind, very oily) and took a bite. To my surprise, the meatballs in them were deep fried - I was concerned that a restaurant would be deep-frying only with vegetable oils, because the cost of fruit oils is prohibitive and animal oils(fats like butter, lard) require much higher temperature to melt and create dangers in the kitchen, as well as smoke.  

I asked the waiter to check with the kitchen what exactly they were fried in. She returned and supplied another, contradictory answer - \"corn oil.\"
The waiters are obviously ignorant, but it seems that if this waiter actually communicated my query to the kitchen, then the cooks are also ignorant. One or both parts of the system make it unsettling to consider being served here if you have any kind of desire to be informed about what you are eating.

I'll never be back. The entire quality of this place is in-your-face cheapness. It's in the components of the foods, it's in the furniture, and it's in the waitstaff."}
{"text":"Please note I'm rating solely on our bar experience, as we'd already eaten before happening upon this gem.  We were going to catch a match at nearby Piper's, but there were way too many City fans that day (sadly, twas not a Spurs match day), so we meandered around and found ourselves thirsty, and here. 

This place has a fabulous bourbon selection, as super reasonable prices.  To put it in perspective, they had rare pours for almost 1/3 the price of those same pours at Butcher and Rye.

Both the menu, and the plates coming out, looked great, had we been hungry.  

This will be a standard on our Pittsburgh trips, even if just for the bourbon."}
{"text":"Delicious, well-prepared food. Had a great trio of duck confit tacos for $14, grilled shishito peppers and entree of scallops and risotto. Very good craft beer selection."}
{"text":"I liked this place but boy, the decor was not what I even imagined. To be clear we came here for a friends birthday. She made some reservations and I just showed up. The birthday girl wanted to go some place different for brunch and boy, did we go someplace different. The decor is, how do I even put it, weird as heck? Or not what I expected. Carmella's owners described it as, \"They both felt that the Southside was ready for a more upscale ambiance that would attract and support a more mature audience. With a lodge-like feel due to the wooden beamed cathedral ceiling, an open fireplace, taxidermy, and stained glass windows that adorn the dining room. Our guests feel as though they are tucked away in a warm and cozy ski lodge in the heart of Southside.\" I do not know if they really hit that nail on the head but it was interesting to say the least. And the food was good, so really that is all that matters. 

I got the Crab Cake Benedict. I thought it was really good. I could have done with a little less of the remoulade sauce, but I was super surprised at the size of the crab cake. The flavor of the dish was good. I would have also liked to have the bacon in a few slices and not chopped up. I think that the poached egg was also done very well, it was impressive. I cannot poach an egg so when I find a place that does it well, I am impressed. 

We also opted for dessert since it was a celebration. We got the last apple berry dumpling. It was fantastic. It came with a scoop of ice cream on the side. Dove right into that one! Yum!!

I will say that it was not what I expected but the food was good and I could be persuaded to go back again. This time, I will be expecting the decor and not surprised by it."}
{"text":"The bar is stunning, with big barrels brimming with taps, so many good things ready to be poured. I wouldn't ordinarily come to this area of town, but on a quiet Sunday late afternoon, it was the perfect place to be.

We were only to stay for one drink, but somehow we stayed for 2, and my sister bought a 6-pack of special brews for her friend to take home.

She was enjoying the various seasonal pumpkin brews and ciders, while my focus was on bourbon. Luckily the helpful, patient and kick-ass bartender Paige told me she makes a good old-fashioned, and boy, did she!

Don Draper would have sucked that puppy right down, lulled by the singer songwriter named Mike DeLuca, doing a slew of bar favorites, while many in the crowd sang along. He even let someone sing with him, which was beyond gracious and totally unnecessary.

It was a good crowd, a mix of Steeler fans and Sunday revelers, soaking in the gorgeous ambiance of this not-too-swanky spot."}
{"text":"Carmella's is an absolute treasure. It doubles as a cozy, laid back establishment to eat an artfully crafted meal and also an classy spot to grab some delicious and unique cocktails. Everything that Carmella's does is put into action like the thoughtful brushstroke of practiced painter.

My choice of meal included the Southside, a cocktail that perfectly marries gin, cucumber and mint to create peak sipability. My entree was the Seared Scallops which included ricotta, flavorful and crispy mushrooms, and English pea risotto. All of the flavors came together as one to allow me to relish in every last bite. Our group also tried an array of appetizers including the Brussel Sprouts, Deviled Eggs, and the Crab and Avocado Dip. I could sing multiple praises for each. The brussels were crispy and flavorful, the deviled eggs were fried and served with a spicy sauce and the crab and avocado dip was addicting. I would recommend trying any of those three.

After I finished I said, and I quote, \"I would invent a time machine right now just to go back to thirty minutes ago and eat that meal again.\" It was a truly fantastic.

The atmosphere is dimly lit and cozy which caters to an intimate evening. The decor is inviting and perfectly suited to the overall character of the space.

I cannot wait to frequent Carmella's time and time again. This has easily taken the top spot on my Pittsburgh favorites list."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for dinner tonight. 
  I really loved the atmosphere. Dark and cozy. I was not impressed with the menu however. It did not feature a large selection and the choices they did have were not anything \"normal\". Most dishes had something I did not like.....cumin, cilantro, hot peppers, roasted tomatoes walnuts. 
  I had the wild mushroom chicken, which was very good. It said it was served with asparagus....1 single asparagus!
   The dish was scattered with some form of garnish ( a rough textured clover leaf). It was similar to bark mulch in texture.  My dining companion loved his pasta dish.
 In my opinion the selection was small and the dishes were overpriced . I most likely won't be back.... Just my taste."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for a girls night out or dinner date. The decor is very cozy and the atmosphere is very fun and has great energy. The food is also a level above traditional Southside food. I highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is quaint and inviting. I came here with several out of town family members and was met with great hospitality and great food. 

I ordered the seasonal side salad to start wish was light and refreshing and then had the bison burger. It was perfectly cooked medium well with potato wedges on the side. Everything was perfectly seasoned. 

My wife ordered the oysters, duck confit duck tacos and crab & avocado dip which she said was amazing. 

They also have an extensive drink menu which the waiter graciously assist us with our selections. 

We definitely will be back to eat here. Can't wait."}
{"text":"One of the funniest experiences I've had in South Side was when I came here on a Tuesday at 10pm and the maitre d' asked if we had a reservation when the restaurant was completely empty! It definitely added to the quiet charm of Carmella's, which I ended up enjoying.

The drinks here are well-executed (although they are by no means cheap). The food is modern-American with a twist. Instead of typical burger made with ground beef, you can expect bison and elk instead. French fries are actually giant potato logs, confit in duck fat. The only negative thing I can say about the food is that it is a bit on the salty side. 

Still, for the creativity and surprising experience, I would recommend checking out Carmella's."}
{"text":"Our party of six (including 2 children) came here after Fat Head's was too busy and crowded during some football game - what a delightful surprise! I was already dreading a meal with the kids in tow (especially when Fat Head's was our original destination) but this location was AMAZING and so kind to my children! 

The decor is just really cool (I wish we were the table with the fire pit in the center!) - so it was cool on face value and gave my kids lots to look at and talk about (A+)

Then, the entire staff was just super friendly and knowledgeable. When my child asked the hostess about juice she was more than accommodating letting him know all the juices they had and continuing his never-ending conversation about food and gosh knows what else.

The beers were YUM and the food was the same. The prices were also not unreasonable which was refreshing. I had the Fall Salad, our entire table devoured 2 apps of pretzels, elk burgers, steak and macaroni cheese all around ... they were even so kind to make a grilled cheese for my four year old (which isn't on the menu). 

It's a smaller place so I think it would be cool for dates because it's intimate and not too loud. If you're really into German culture, you'll like the plates and everything else too - they serve beers in the glasses they are meant to be served in and the plates are genuine (albeit fragile! And no - we didn't break anything)

This place was just a really cool find on Carson Street - and I didn't even know you couldn't smoke there but that would explain why I could breathe during my meal. A++ from this original NY-er where smoking was banned over a decade ago in restaurants."}
{"text":"So obviously, I'm already a huge fan of Carmella's, but..... In a world of meat eaters and having a hard time finding yummy quality vegan dishes. I sure love it here way more after our visit last night. We had a party of about 27 and I let Carmella know ahead of time that there were two vegans in our group. Annoying, maybe? But, Carmella was sooo accommodating and made it so simple and easy. I told her we love any veggies and would be happy with anything and her Chef really delivered! Our dish was AMAZING and I'm actually wishing I had some right now writing this review. What I loved about it is it was not covered in oil, yes yes yes! Fresh, delicious, not oily and just soooo tasty! Thank you so much! There was asparagus, beans, tomatoes all topped with fresh pesto!"}
{"text":"Having been at the Foundry the weekend before for brunch, Carmella's paled in comparison. Our entrees took forever to come out (on not a very busy day), which was only made better by the caraffes of bloody marys and mimosas. To make it worse, our service was awful; and, the food was underwhelming. The decor is worth checking out; and, I would imagine makes Carmella's a good stop for tapas and drinks with a date. But it's just not a great spot for brunch."}
{"text":"I've been to Carmella's twice before, once for drinks and once for dinner, and it was okay. However, I went a third time during restaurant week and was supremely disappointed. 1) I ordered the lamb. The server did not ask how I wanted it cooked and it came out well done. Lamb should be rare or medium rare. 2) I ordered one of the specialty margaritas and it was not strained properly. There were pieces of herbs that were annoyingly going into my mouth and then I kept trying to avoid them while I was drinking...it just wasn't great when you are trying to have a conversation. 3) The chocolate chip cookie for dessert was the worst chocolate chip cookie I've ever tasted. It tasted like a health cookie. In other words, it was extremely bland. The two stars is because I did like my appetizer...a prosciutto/ asparagus salad and the drink did actually taste refreshing."}
{"text":"Very cool place. It's so cozy inside, I wish I could live there! 

They have a great rotating craft list if you are a beer snob like moi! Great seasonal beers as well.

We had already eaten dinner so we didn't order food, but the table in the back with the fireplace was open and we had a group so we sat around the fireplace and had our beers there. So warm!!

The man checking IDs at the front was friendly and a true character. He ribbed us about our beer selection, but seemed to know a lot about both their beers and their large whiskey selection.

We would definitely go back and have dinner here. It's a refreshing newer spot in the otherwise disappointing Southside.

If your looking for another cool, chill, not chock full of losers bar, Smokin Joes is just down the street."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I had high hopes for this place and maybe I just came at a bad time...but the service was absolutely horrible. It took an hour to get our food and another 20 minutes after we finished it to get our check. Luckily, I had a few adult beverages and was out celebrating finding my wedding dress that day so I was in a good mood, because otherwise I would probably have bitched up a storm. Either way, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for brunch on a Sunday. It is SO different from the old Inn Termission Lounge that use to be at this location! Beautiful job with the renovations! The decor and atmosphere is a huge improvement. The bathroom especially was a nice treat, just gorgeous.  My husband got a chilli mash that he very much enjoyed, while I got the BLT with vinegar fries. The bacon was a bit on the greasy side, but overall our food was just what we needed. I've only given Carmella's three stars for 2 reasons. 1. It's hard to judge a place before experiencing dinner service. In my mind the dinner experience can make or break an establishment. And 2. Even though I think the decor is a vast improvement, the mounted animal heads, the old-timey aprons worn by the waitsstaff, the toadstool of ketchup (see pic), all come off a bit try-hard. 

But I will be back for dinner, definitely interested in trying this place out again and hopefully giving it more stars."}
{"text":"We met up with one of our Yelp friend's for Brunch here on an early Sunday afternoon around 1pm.  I made reservations ahead of time just in case.  I never like parking in the South Side but that's why we like to come here on Sunday because it's usually easy to get street parking.  Not his Sunday.  There was some kind of bike race going on and Carson Street was blocked.  A couple bridges were shut down too.  It really caused us to get here later than we wanted and not in the best mood but we made it and we are so glad that we came here.

     You walk in and it's a long sort of rectangle type of restaurant.  The bar was to the left and on the right side there were tables along the wall that were all reserved.  We had a reservation so we just sat down at a reserved table.  There was table seating at the back of the restaurant that would be good if you brought kids here or wanted a quieter atmosphere but we didn't go back there.

     When we sat down a waitress came up to greet us and gave us menus.  My wife ordered an Irish coffee and I just got some water.  Carrie's coffee was a French press coffee.  So they gave her the liquor in a cup at first but she had to wait a few minutes for the French press coffee to brew while on the table.  It was really cool!  It's a strong coffee (more for the caffeine) but she liked it!  I was really hungry so I decided against having a drink but their beer on tap looked good.

     I liked their brunch menu a lot. I was going back and forth on a few different things but I finally decided on the Carmella's Breakfast.  It had everything that I wanted on there and I was so hungry.  Carrie ordered their Crab Cake Benedict.  

     The food came out at a reasonable time and it was really good.  Carrie liked her Crab cake Benedict a lot.  It looked really tasty.  There was nothing great about my brunch but it was still very good.  It comes with your plain old breakfast items but that is what I wanted.  The eggs were good.  The Belgian waffle with their sausage was delicious.  The only thing disappointing was the fresh fruit that came with it.  I seriously only got 4 small blackberries for my fresh fruit.  It was more of a garnish.  Anyways it was a filling meal and I was happy.  I would like to try their other brunch items on a return visit one day.

     Other than Carson Street being shut down the atmosphere was great for Sunday Brunch.  It looks like a cool place to have dinner and drinks watching a sporting event too.  If you're looking for a good brunch stop you will not be disappointing in trying Carmella's brunch on a Sunday afternoon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, well prepared and nicely plated. 

My Duck Confit Tacos were absolutely delicious and the Bison Burger was very good. 

The portions are not huge at this price point but they are enough to leave full and the quality of the food more than makes up for it. 

The atmosphere was described by Munch as a \"pre-prohibition hunting lodge\". I cannot confirm
whether or not that is true (I'm not 90 years old.) However, it does have a homey lodge feel and everything has a nice classic feel. 

Excellent draft list and very good classic cocktails."}
{"text":"Carmella's is a great little spot in the Southside (sah'side for you 'burghers). I went with 6 others and we had 3 of the appetizers; deviled eggs, crab spread, hummus. All were SO delicious. This is actually a 4.5 star rating because the food was so dang good and the atmosphere is antique-y and a tad rustic. Our server wasn't really on top of it tonight and we all could have used several water refills...plus he almost stabbed me with my fork when clearing a bunch of plates...but hey, I lived to tell the story. For dinner I had the spring vegetable curry and it was uh-mazing. The kimchi added a very nice flavor. Since I was with a birthday girl who knew the owner, we got a free charcuterie and cheese board. Very delicious! I also had the mint julep and it was spot on. I would be back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, any bar that has rotating wines on tap (yes, ON TAP) is an okay bar with me. 

Came in on a Monday evening, unfortunately they weren't serving food, which was half the reason we ended up at Carmella's. The good news is that the bar completely made up for it. They have their own infused vodka, and the bartender was more than willing to make up a drink around what kind of vodka I wanted. I hear their thing is the moscow mule, but never got a chance to try it. 

The ambiance is pretty cool, very laid back and relaxing. Definitely a place to go in Southside if you don't want to end up at Mario's."}
{"text":"Service was not the best at all. Literally had to keep waiting for the waitress to come over to our table just to introduce herself, take our drink order, take our food order, and bring the check. Now on a positive note, their lemons were some of the best lemons I have ever tasted! I got lemon for my water only to be blown away by the amazing taste of them. No other restaurant has ever had lemons this good!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch here with the family. Everything was delicious. We had baked eggs, omelette of the day, and BLT. All the dishes were flavorful, made from the fresh high quality ingredients. Atmosphere is very cool, interior design is really special. Overall, great restaurant/bar. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Great drink selection. Decent food selection. Rustic ambiance with really busy wallpaper and animal heads sticking out from every wall. 

Hung out here for about two and a half hours over a drink and dinner. Crab cakes portion size looks disappointing for $19, but were surprisingly filling and very good. Drink of choice for the night was an Old Fashioned-- can't truly comment on how it was because I'm definitely not an avid whiskey drinker and had no idea if it was good or not. It tasted like I was taking a shot with every sip? Don't know if that helps. 

The backroom was totally dead by 10 on a Friday, but the front was full of people. Would come back again for drinks (probably would skip the food) with a DD so I could fully enjoy their drink selection."}
{"text":"We went with a group of 20 people for New Years Eve and not only was the food amazing and prompt, but the staff was beyond efficient and friendly. We had several people with food allergies and they handled it flawlessly.  I had the scallops which were so fresh and sweet and not overpowered by the rest of the dish. We had basically every dish on the menu and everyone was happy. The prices are very reasonable and the wine delicious as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Carmella's a newcomer on Carson Street, replacing the trusty and rusty dive bar Intermission.  

Like several other new places in Pittsburgh, Carmella's is trying to capitalize on the current popularity of prohibition-type cocktail bars. As a bar, it succeeds. As a restaurant, not so much... yet. 

Decor:  Picture yourself inside an old hunting lodge, only cleaner. No. Picture an Abercrombie and Fitch without the smell of Fierce cologne choking you. Moose heads on the walls, cozy fires, men and women sharply dressed in vests and plaid. But instead of selling you $60 sweaters, these fine folks are selling you handcrafted cocktails, beer, and whiskey. The latter, in my opinion, is a much better way of spending your money. 

Service: The servers and bartenders are incredibly friendly and attentive, which is great! I know this sounds odd, but Carmella's is the only place I've ever been to that overdoes the service. This is not first class seating on an overseas flight to Dubai. I don't need a hot towel before I start tucking into my appetizer. Notwithstanding, servers are well versed regarding both drinks (they can tailor drinks according to your taste) and food.  Speaking of the food...

\"Plates\":  Let me say that all of the dishes I have had at Carmella's are as delicious as they are innovative.  The head chef and Cutthroat Kitchen winner - true story - creates amazing food. We were given tiny tasters of watermelon and lime with cilantro as a palate cleanser. The gnocchi is light and smothered in a decadent bolognese sauce with mascarpone cheese.  The lamb meatball is incredibly flavorful and will leave you wanting more. The charcuterie appetizer (pricey at 20+) is an intuitive pairing of meats and cheeses. So what's the problem? The plates are so small they couldn't satisfy a mouse's hunger. There were barely four or five gnocchi and one singular medium meatball for my friend. If Carmella's wants to market themselves as a tapas or small plates restaurant, that is fine (hint: they should!). But that is concept is completely lost on the menu. Currently, the appetizers and entrees are separated by sections but are the same size - tiny. A table for two would need at least four or five items to satiate their appetites. Add a few drinks, you are looking at a large bill! All that is needed is a simple re-write of the menu and perhaps a slight increase in portion size. Hot small plates. Cold small plates. Desserts. Order a few and share! Problem solved.

Drinks: Extensive and decently priced whiskeys from the tried and true Jonny Walker to my lesser known favorites like Yamazaki and Angel's Envy. Handcrafted cocktails and and an incredible selection of affordable draft beers. I don't have to go on because this review is already rather verbose. 

TLDR; Carmella's does the \"Pints\" part perfectly. The delicious \"Plates\" need a little more explanation and organization and I will happily give them five stars when that happens."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Sunday.  The ambiance in their dining room is awesome.  I couldn't stop looking around!  I got the bison burger and potato wedges.  The burger was cooked to my liking and very filling.  They have some nice weekly specials that I intend on coming back to try.  This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom nom.  Gulp. 
Mmmmmmm. Sooooo. Good. So. Very. Good. 
Go here. Go to the back to eat real food in an actual hidden gem. You're welcome. 

A. M. A. Z. I. N. G. 

Oh where to begin. 
When you first arrive the bar & staff are noticeably sharper than the average neighborhood bar. And it's easy to get cozy at the bar with friendly staff & amazing appetizers and bar food.
But don't. Keep going. The restaurant area is absolutely too unique too miss. Get a table. Relax. Chat with your waitress. Order some appetizers & hand mixed drinks before going all out with selecting your meal. Our favorite- to each order a different item and switch and swap. Some items we love and order over & over again- and honestly- we've enjoyed everything so far- 

Avocado & crab dip- I don't even like avocados ( no joke, Some would say that I passionately dislike them) yet this dip, - I would lick it off the dish if nobody was looking. Oh who am I kidding? I might someday it you were!!! 

Hummus- oh. Yeah. Just enough of a zip of spice on the tongue to be perfect!  So delicious. 

Green leafy healthy apps- fresh, crisp. So good.  Definitely make the decision to have one before your meal.  I am partial to the Winter Salad. The roasted beets are soooo good. I can't even explain just how delicious I want to put into words that it is. It just is beyond words delicious. Fantastic choice. 

Mac N Cheese- I could start to drool just thinking about it. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. So good. Spicy w sharp white cheddar. 

The Cauliflower- It doesn't sound like it is amazing. It is. Roasted. Pine nuts. Spiced perfectly. This isn't your momma' cauliflower. Or any other cauliflower you've ever had. This is cauliflower you will crave and be begging for more of. It's the only cauliflower I've ever had such passionate feelings towards. 

Duck Lard- I never thought I'd have an opinion about duck fat. It turns out. I do. Thanks to Carmela's I feel passionate about wanting food that's been cooked in it. Read the menu. Look for the items that have been cooked in ducks fat. Order those items. Consume them. You will end your meal being pleasantly content with your life choices. French fries are heavily. French fries cooked in duck fat are like having angels hand feed you French fries while singing from the heavens. 

Oh, Carmela's. The unassuming restaurant front on Carson Street hides the glorious experience provided inside. If you haven't had their delectable plates & pints, hurry to experience this darling establishment.


The only con, and some would consider it a strength, it's not a place to bring a small kid or baby. We take our Mr. Toddler our dining all over the place. He's been dining out since the day he went him from the hospital. He dines out almost everywhere with us. Except here. This isn't a place for little kiddo's. The space is too cozy.


Update---  2016 summer restaurant week

I love this place even more! It's time to open a second location as the secret it out about Carmella's awesomeness."}
