{"text":"Great food, fast service and cheap prices, you can't get any better than that. The owner is super nice and accommodating. The absolute best part is how clean it is. This is my go to spot after a workout."}
{"text":"Great shawarma in Vaughan. two shawarma $8.85! unique flavour & delicious food. Staff also very friendly & their service is fast than other place. We will back sure in this place. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"My Buddy told me about this location, so I checked out the website! I was surprised by the reasonable prices! I went riding on my Harley Saturday in Vaughan, so i stopped in, got the special,2 shawerma for 10 bux including tax! one chicken, 1 beef, really tasty and not stingy on the meat! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Very reasonable pricing. Large chicken shawarma with choice of a side and drink for about 7 I bucks. 3 of us ate and paid 27 dollars. Shawarma is delicious and I love that they put the wraps in a panini press to make the edges sealed and crispy !"}
{"text":"Good people, fresh food.  falafel was made fresh. quite clean place.  Prices and portions are good."}
{"text":"Wawaweewow!  Probably the best shawarma i have ever tasted.  Meat can be eaten by itself.  A unique flavor and very fresh and juicy.  Im used to dry meat with sauce as compensation at most shawarma places i have visited but this one is the opposite.  And what gets me is the prices.  You definetly get much more quality then what you pay for.   Portions are great too.  Places like Paramount and Alibaba should take notice.  The biggest con for me is the location as i live downtown Toronto and was just visiting the area.  This place has raised the bar where i probably cant eat another shawarma in my hood.  Owner is nice and friendly as well.  Crossing my fingers these guys do well, stay consistant and can open another location closer to me."}
{"text":"We just happen to stop in at this place today.  We had some reservations but ordered the special 2 shawarma' for $8,85 amazing.  Really enjoyed my lunch and will certainly go back to this place.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"The prices are good but you get what you pay for. The toppings didn't look fresh and the shawarma toppings are limited, the shawarma I got was ripped during prep and the employee wouldn't make another one. Pay a little extra and get better food."}
{"text":"Great Shawarma, hearty portions, friendly staff, reasonable prices. I'll definitely be back.."}
