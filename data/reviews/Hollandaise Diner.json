{"text":"Nice little diner. Delicious classic Eggs Benny. Home fries could use more flavour / seasoning.  Great service"}
{"text":"Service was friendly. Food was not good. Toast was not even toasted. Home fries were hard inside and almost burned outside. Eggs were over cooked and restaurant and food was cold as the food. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I want to start by talking about the mentality I had going in. I have heard great things about Hollandaise Diner from a friend, but when I saw the yelp review, I was a little surprised. So before I stepped into the diner today, I had almost no expectation. I just really wanted to get an eggs benny. So I ordered the Croque Madame since I have never seen it before. The grilled cheese went surprisingly well with the poached eggs! To my surprise, the whole dish wasn't too greasy!  I definitely recommend this place to fellow eggs benny lover!! The environment is family friendly too!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I pretty much have become a regular. Everyone who I have introduced to this place is also in love with it.   I LOVE the build-a-benny option. I eat mostly low carb so love that I have options other than just an english muffin. I change it up everytime and often use their ingredient of the week.   The staff are all super friendly. Their coffee is really good. The place is comfy and welcoming."}
{"text":"Owner is lovely. I have been a few times, the food is good - particularly like the spicy salmon (smoked salmon) breakfast sandwich!  They JUST need to up their coffee game."}
{"text":"Smoked bloke eggs Benny was great!  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the Hollandaise was very tasty.  Home fries were deliciously flavored but I would ask to have them extra crispy next time.  Ordered a chocolate pancake with raspberry sauce on the side and it was killer!  Not too sweet and the sauce had the perfect sweet/tart balance.  The coffee is very strong.  Not my favourite.  Great service!  Overall, an awesome brunch place.  I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Just spent $50 for 1 child and 2 adults. Meal would have gotten a 3 star if total cost came out to $15.   -Bread taste like process junk from no-frills and instead of real butter, some kind of mystery grease. -Pancake was depressingly plain and burnt in the bottom. McDonald Pancake significantly more satisfying. -Sauce for Pancake taste like simple jam, with water and sugar mixed in. -Coffee had funny after taste, you'd get from not properly cleaned brewer or funky tap water. -Wife's Egg Benedict was hard boiled. -Over easy eggs was done well, but no salt added to eggs. completely tasteless. -Sausage was those tiny ones from any cheap grocery store.  -Bacon strip was nice and crispy, like microwaved. -Nothing was seasoned (no salt). -The place smelt like oil base paint.   There's no love here. Just a cash grab. The area could really use a good breakfast place which is probably why this place is even getting reviews."}
{"text":"This is a great brunch place,  been here many times. They have great service,  good food and the server are really friendly. I would highly recommend hollandaise,  just make sure you get there early as they have limited seating"}
{"text":"We just got back from this new place in our neighbourhood which we've heard so much about. First off we waited in line for about 40 minutes which was entirely due to the fact that the kitchen was so slow that in the entire time we waited, only a few meals came out.  The food was barely mediocre.  My son ordered the 'pyramid of pancakes' from the kids menu and got three extremely thin, cold pancakes.  One was a normal size and the other two were the size of loonies.  Definitely a much smaller portion than was expected and we ended up giving him food from our plates to fill him up.  I had the hungry diner.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the potatoes were cold and bland, the beans were cold, the pancake was thin and cold and seemed pre-cooked.  My husband ordered the croque madame which he enjoyed but again the potatoes were cold.    Other than my well cooked eggs and the server being very nice, I have nothing great to say about this place.  Those two things aren't worth the wait or the money and are definitely not enough to warrant a repeat visit.  You can find a million other places that serve a mediocre breakfast without the wait."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food especially you get to build your own Benny and the poutine is good too. But for its portion, I would say it's a lil overpriced. It took us 15mins to get seated and another 20mins to have the food served. It's understaffed on a weekend."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff are great. Food is great - nothing fancy but for a diner, they do put in a little extra effort to make it nice. Our fav local spot."}
{"text":"An unlikely location for such good food. Had BLT on sour dough, was absolutely on point!  Bread was super fresh, all of the ingredients tasted really good. The server was very pleasant- and the price is very reasonable.   Noticed that they also supply the French's all Canadian ketchup, nice touch.     A return visit is definitely in the cards for us in the not too distant future."}
{"text":"We tried Sunday brunch. The first thing we noticed was that there was a short line, but we expected this.  It's nice inside for such a small diner, it's clean and has wood panelled walls. I think it could do away with the type of art being displayed though.   As we waited we saw there were empty tables, but because there was only one waitress, we had to wait for her to find time to clear. I think it's a mistake to only have one waitress on at your busiest hour at a restaurant that focuses on brunch. Kudos to the waitress though, the service was good.  I got the cajun benny. The presentation was nice and the cook was nice.. but usually when I order cajun I expect seasoning. What... It had next to no seasoning.. I had to add salt and I never had to do that in a restaurant in TO til this day.. also not near enough hollandaise on my plate in Hollandaise diner, there was only enough for my egg and nothing else. The others said the same thing. Eggs cooked nice... but No seasoning on the food. If it had.. it would be worth a return.. so three stars for a nicely poached egg."}
{"text":"Charming interior. Seating for only 25 max. Nice menu. The chocolate infused pancakes are excellent. Croquet Madam is very good. Prices are not bad. Service was very good. Would definitely recommend. Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"So very disappointing.   For a place called \"Hollandaise\", you'd think the sauce would be amazers.  Sadly, it fell short and I felt it was bland and had a funky aftertaste as if it had been mixed with corn starch or flour as a thickener rather than pure butter and egg yolk.  My Florentine eggs benny actually seemed very bland throughout, save for the bacon that I ordered on the side.  These 3 small strips of bacon, by the way, cost a whopping $3.54.  Even the glass of fresh orange juice was only $2.66, how did the bacon cost so much?  On the plus side, my eggs were perfectly poached with deliciously runny yolks.    Though the prices for the mains here are a couple bucks lower than some other brunch spots in the city, I'd recommend skipping this place and going to another instead..."}
{"text":"It's not one of those cheap breakfast diners with a generic menu but it doesn't quite reach their aspirations of a gourmet breakfast. It's pretty difficult to pump out quality for so many people but I still wasn't too impressed. The best thing they have going for them is that there's nothing good in that stretch of the danforth. Lots of people air bnb there and it's the only real destination for breakfast."}
{"text":"So. GOOD! Oh my goodness. Since I moved to Toronto 5 months ago I've tried a new brunch spot every Sunday and this is my favorite so far! The service was great - very attentive and friendly. The food is amazing - perfect eggs benny and delicious home fries! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes! I'm not getting them anywhere else. They specialize in pancakes and benedicts, have great varieties of hollandaise sauce and pancake sauces. They make the sauces in house. The home fries is amazing, you can tell they put in a lot of attention to make the food great. Very affordable as well."}
{"text":"Had the classic eggs Benedict and it was delicious. Coffee was top shelf. Waitress was super nice, gonna try her version of eggs Benedict when I go back. The place has a great vibe, more than just the music which was also great. Even the garnish(orange slice) looked great."}
{"text":"Good food with lots of options on the menu, but the frendly staff weren't very coordinated (taking a long time to clean tables or offer coffee at start of meal). Portions are about right. Can be a bit loud."}
{"text":"This place needs to improve their customer service. We came in for Sunday brunch but the staff just seemed to be in slow motion. A glassy-eyed hostess did not actually greet us but did put our names down in her little booklet. We proceeded to wait and wait and wait and wait in line while two tables sat free and the only waitress spent the entire time we were there making 4 take out coffees for someone. We decided to leave as we were not feeling very confident that we would get food in our belly in any sort of reasonable time frame. It's too bad because I really wanted to try this place. Gave them 3 stars because I didn't want to spoil their rating when we haven't even tried their food."}
{"text":"The place is small and they did not have the air conditioner on. We went in asked for a coffee, they only brought one and had to ask for another. I ordered the vegetarian poutine and my boyfriend ordered the big breakfast. I was disappointed with the poutine, the potatoes were not French fries cut (as they would normally for a poutine) I don't even know if they had gravy on it! no cheese curds, the home fries were bland and tasteless I honestly don't know how you can mess up home fries so bad.     You would assume that they would have a good hollandaise sauce because of the name of the restaurant, but guess what? IT SUCKED, I've tasted different hollandise sauce and this one is tasteless and it just sucks. My boyfriend had the big breakfast, they served it with barely any eggs two small bacon and two small sausage... a McDonald's big breakfast would fill you up more than the portion they have! He also said that his potatoes sucks.   Ok let's put it this way, the breakfast and the experience was so bad that we went to McDonald's after so my boyfriend can get more food and I can get proper coffee. The waiter was wearing a very low Vneck tshirt where his chest hair sticks out..never came around to ask us how the food is going.   Waste of money, never going back. You're better off going to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Cute little space with a wide variety of breakfast options. It can get pretty stuffy in there, so they might want to look at their ventilation situation, but that's minor. The space is well decorated neatly kept. Our server was super friendly and very accommodating. I ate the spicy salmon sandwich with a side of fruit and a glass of fresh orange juice and everything was delicious and priced within reason. It's just around the corner from home, so I'll definitely be back, especially considering they're open on Mondays, when many other shops are closed."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Their pancake sauces are homemade, not synthesized jar stuff. We all had variations of a egg & meat breakfast and no complaints. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with a friend and we both had The Classic eggs benedict (served with homefries for $11). The hollandaise sauce was the perfect blend of buttery and lemony. Everything was perfectly cooked. Delicious.   Today I had The Cajun (baked polenta instead of an English muffin, sautéed onions and peppers, and Cajun spiced hollandaise sauce). My spice tolerance is low but this was perfect. It was the perfect blend of sweet from the veg and spicy from the Cajun spices. It was deliciously peppery. My mom had the Loaded BLT($6) (bitter greens, bacon, tomato, and mayo) on sourdough. The veggies were fresh and crisp. The sourdough from the local baker (Celena's Bakery) was just the right level of tangy. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Coffee is wonderful.  Food is fresh and they use quality ingredients and the  veggies are not overcooked and have the best bread selection around!"}
{"text":"I absolutely wanted to LOVE this place. Our hood is certainly improving, and it needs great places to eat. I went with my husband on a weekday morning. There was no one else there, so you'd think the service would be perfect. Our waiter was friendly, but kind of awkward. The food took quite a while to come out, and when it did, it was ok, but not better than that. We both had bennys which were fine. The potatoes were on the cold side, and undercooked. There wasn't anything bad about it, to be fair, but it just wasn't that great. So, although I can walk there, I'll hop on my bike instead, and head to my favourite spot in Leslieville. It's a shame, really."}
{"text":"Hollandaise was grainy and tasteless, peameal was thin overcooked and dry, one egg was poached hard the other soft but stringy white, home fried potatoes where under cooked and bland... I asked only for one special thing... that my english muffin be on the side well done/burnt... nope, barely toasted. If the service staff had bothered checking in with me I might have sent it back for a do over... instead I sat there drinking what tea made it into my cup from the dripping pot... not touching the rest of my meal.  Im beyond disappointed in this place... sorry Hollandaise Diner... you wont survive...."}
{"text":"Have been looking forward to brunch here for a long time. When I finally got to it, I realized while the food may be good, the property was not the best.  It's quite small and cramped. The A/C wasn't on when I visited. Even though a table was open, as my friend wasn't present, I was told to wait outside the venue (there's literally no space indoors to stand).  It's a cute place, but I foresee issues because of how limited the space inside is.  The food was something else. We had a mushroom and brie frittata and an classic benedict. Honestly the frittata was not worth while. The benedict however, oh mans!! It was delicious. I subbed out bacon for turkey bacon and found the paprika hollandaise sauce to be the perfect sauce.  I like that this place has opened up in a neighbourhood that's lacking all the cute brunch spots and bars of other neighbourhoods. But I'm not sure I'll be going back too often as the space issue is not one I'd like to contend with in Toronto (heat alerts and cold alerts anyone?). But maybe with some time, this could be solved."}
{"text":"I think that a friend said it best when referring to Hollandaise- \"It is a decent, but that's all it really is.\"  And although this doesn't really say all that much, it actually says it all.    We live approximately 8-minutes from HD and when it first opened for business we were super excited to try it, even more excited that friends from the \"trendy\" west-end were not only willing, BUT wanted to meet us so close to home.  Could we finally claim one of the city's best new brunch spots as our own...  HD provides a no-frills space, which isn't a problem, but the service was a bit slow and we waited in the cold for almost half an hour before even getting in the door.  We were definitely prepared to wait a bit, and we did understand that we had come to a small brunch spot at brunch, so some wait time was inevitable, but there were only two couples in front of us.  The food was decent, but unfortunately didn't quite live up to the hype.  Two of us tried the Smoke Blue, which is a fairly standard eggs benny with smoked salmon, and it was ok.  My wife had the Croque Madame, which is a grilled cheese with fried ham and hollandaise, which looked to be generous offering.  The food was definitely decent, the service was decidedly good, if not a bit slowish, and we will give HD another shot.  We would love to see a top brunch contender so close to home!"}
{"text":"Ok so I went to check this place out as it is just up the street from me. I was excited at having a place that catered to my favourite breakfast dish so close to home. Let's say I was....DISAPPOINTED! I really wanted to like this place but alas, I was let down. The eggs Benny I ordered on grilled cheese came on 2 tiny pieces with the slimmest ham shavings ever! The eggs were not soft poached, but hard! I got the smallest serving of home fries ever at a breakfast joint. My daughter had pancakes which were decent, but the side of peameal bacon I ordered (which cost almost $4) was the thinnest slices I'd ever seen when ordering peameal bacon. An adult could eat all 3 tiny pieces in 3 bites. Smh! The service didn't make up for it either. Anyhow with so many choices close by, I would not waste my time with this place. Definitely not worth the money!...it's too bad."}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict I had were amazing. The service was really great too. Super friendly. Would definitely go back for that hollandaise sauce!"}
{"text":"Had croque madame benny. Overcooked egg. They tried to make it up by replacing the egg (already ate one of the two) but came back with soggy wet bread. Not going back."}
{"text":"i really wanted to like this place. it is in an area sorely in need of a few more bright and cheery places. i went with my daughter and her crew a week or so ago and it was packed. waited and when it came around to getting seated all was fine though chaotic. i thought the food was bland but we came for the gluten free choices and we figured it was new and busy. give it a pass and try again.  i went back alone this past saturday so jan 2. they had advertised the were open at 7:00 am every day even the holiday. i got there at 7:25 and with no one else there i figured i would get in and gone before the parking cost at 8:00.  to get 2 over easy eggs and a handful of under done potatoes and 3 barely done sausages. a cup of black coffee 2/3rds full and the refill the same took almost 30 minutes to arrive.  the potatoes were awful. i don't think they use butter or oil but fry them dry. no flavour and they were underdone. i don't get toast. most restaurants give me a couple of slices of tomato. nothing here.  so for this plate and the coffee it was $12.25!!!  i really think these guys are learning on the job and are pretty clueless though they mean well but $12 not including a tip for a sausage and eggs brek is ridiculous. you are on danforth east and far east at that not the distillery district. i'm betting the boys in the honda dealership across the road won't be eating there much.  and fix the door.  i shouldn't be all negative. the eggs were good. a breakfast place made the eggs right. though he said part of the delay was he had to make them twice...."}
{"text":"Considering our bill, I didn't feel like I got my money's worth. Service was okay, food was meh. Overall a pretty underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"Like getting breakfast at a small town hotel. Everything was well-made, but nothing stood out. They have interesting hollandaise flavours, but they were all pretty bland.  This spot is family friendly. The service was slow, for example it took us 15 minutes to get the bill, but that's likely not an issue for this crowd.  I'd go back here for one of *those* mornings when the food isn't as important as just getting food inya, and the lack of line-ups is important.  This was their first weekend, so I'll likely give them another serious try."}
{"text":"When it comes to breakfast which you can make with a handful number of ingredients, serving size is important. Novelty can only take you so far. I can have just as good of eggs benny (probably even better) at a breakfast place that no one talks about. Their serving might even be more. The most I can say is it's not bad. But nothing to write home about.  The service and the bacon saved the day."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a convenient location at Danforth where it is easier for you to find parking in the laterals streets and it has a good atmosphere and service. The food is not what I was expecting by the name of the restaurant. I thought I was going to find traditional Dutch food but in fact it was an interesting surprise that they actually have a selection of Benedict eggs! I guess the name comes from the hollandaise sauce  :-)"}
{"text":"A cute diner. There aren't too many tables. They did not have the AC on when we went and it may have been good as the kitchen gave a lot of heat, even though the weather wasn't too hot outside.   Food was so so.  Coconut tomato Benny - I was surprised it didn't come with an English muffin. It was a tomato with a pouched egg on top and coconut hollandaise sauce. I didn't taste much of the coconut in the sauce and it was kind of bland so there wasn't much taste to the Benny itself. The potatoes were a bit undercooked. The portion itself was small so I suggest ordering a side if you get this.  Meat loaf Benny - again, we were surprised that it wasn't on an English muffin, instead, it was a meat loaf on a pouched egg with a curry hollandaise sauce. This was Better than the above because it had more taste, but again, portions were small.  We didn't order anything else so the total came up to $30. I wouldn't say this was worth the price because of the portion size and the lack of English muffin. It was $12 per meal. But, having said this, The Bennys selections are unique if you want to try Bennys without the carbs. You can also build  you own. Personally, I want my carbs!   Service was good, but I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"A cute hidden gem on an otherwise drab stretch of the Danforth. Food overall was decent, with great variety and customization options: buttermilk, chocolate infused or coconut pancakes! Build your own Benny! Need I say more?   Prices are very reasonable and service was friendly and attentive. They have a kids menu too, which is great.  As others have noted it is small, but that adds to the charm and the seating certainly doesn't feel cramped."}
{"text":"Hollandaise Diner is this sweet little oasis from the crazy traffic and psycho wind that was raging outside the day we went for brunch. Right away I realized they may actually have the best decaffeinated coffee I have ever had.   I accidentally ordered my own unique version of The Great Canadian Breakfast Poutine. Knowing that everything can be potentially slathered with Hollandaise sauce I ordered my poached egg medium well. I was then informed it did not come with a poached egg but if I wanted one, then I could have one. My sisters insisted that I have it the way I want it because it was my birthday!  Both of my sisters ordered a more traditional diner-stye breakfast and loved it. Then, all of a sudden... A beautiful complimentary birthday pancake complete with funfetti was delivered to our table!  That pancake was crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside and I swooned over the poutine. In fact it totally took me back to the days our mom would make us her cheesy potatoes. Every bite of mushroom, potato, bacon, sausage, cheese slathered with that poached egg with Hollandaise sauce made me feel at home. Comfort food galore!  Not only that but our server was super sweet and kind. Everything was perfect. The food was delicious, the place was cozy and warm and the service was out of this world. I honestly can not think of one bad thing to say about it at all and considering what I was going through at the time... They even wished me happy birthday on Instagram!

{"text":"This place is THE Go-to for all your brunch needs..especially on a cold day when it's -16 outside!   Place is small & cozy and the eggs benny definitely hit the spot!!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Charming little startup restaurant with friendly, quick service. Good coffee and fresh squeezed OJ. Nice feature: build your own Benny!  We riffed on the Croque Madame: went for zesty and Cajun hollondaise, with added peameal bacon.   Delicious."}
{"text":"I found the Hollandaise to be quite underwhelming. The meal was sloppy and flavour bland. My baked polenta was undercooked and the hollandaise sauce wasn't the best. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"So cute! This is a small little breakfast/brunch diner nothing fancy but staff was super friendly and nice. Wasn't too busy on the Monday morning when we walked in. We ordered the Florentine Benny, pancakes with chocolate chips and maple syrup, and side orders of sausages. Everything was very tasty, the only this was the spinach in the Benny was not cooked so if that's not your thing try something else. I also ordered the SPICY GARLIC AIOLI, not on the menu but soooooo gooood! They have freshly squeezed orange juice too Definitely will be back. Will try  smoked Salmon Benny next time."}
{"text":"We went there last weekend. We really enjoyed the food, tasty, unpretentious and to the point. That's how most brunches should be.  The cajun benedict was amazing.  The staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"I don't do many 5 stars however the OVERALL experience was amazing.   Let's start by saying I woke up today and had to choose where I wanted to have my birthday breakfast. This is the place I chose and it was the best decision I made.   Small quaint diner, the owner was extremely personable, service was quick and the food was delicious.   The mister had the hungry diner ( two eggs bacon sausage home fries pancake and toast) and I had a build a Benny (English muffin tomato and mushrooms) with home fries. We also got a side of bacon and sausage (because I needed to try everything) EVERYTHING was fantastic (my super picky mister enjoyed every bite) , literally nothing to complain about except my stomach couldn't eat it all.   The gentleman who served us was the co owner and he was fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. PLEASE try the chocolate pancake, it honestly took me back to my childhood."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Nice breakfast/brunch menu. I would have given it a 5 if it wasn't for the forgetful and inattentive waiter. I would probably go back here though."}
{"text":"Just ate there was lucky and got a table right away. Food came fast after ordered had the classic eggs Benedict.  Today is there 2nd anniversary.  It's a small place, servers are nice.  Would go again."}
{"text":"My Wife and I enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and the waitstaff was excellent, the food was like home but on steroids the meatloaf and eggs Benedict were the best!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service was everything we could ask for, our waitress was kind, quick, and stayed attentive. The food was incredible and reasonably priced. This is definitely one of the best classic eggs Benedict's I've ever had!!  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
