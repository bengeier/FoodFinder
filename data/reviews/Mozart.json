{"text":"Nice little kosher Restaurent 
Had the falafel plate. I was quite impressed with the flavours. It was quite simple and fresh. The falafel a were nice and crispy, cabbage salad was simple.
I loved the charisa (hot sauce) was nice and spicy. Loved the flavours. Pita bread was thick and warm. 
I'll com back to try other plates. While looking around I find the plates quite large and all looks good."}
{"text":"Cute kosher restaurant with nice outdoor seating section.
Compared to my last kosher restaurant experience, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. The interior is modern and comfortable. I had the falafel plate and it was a nice portion, yummy flavours and good price. The pita and falafel were very fresh. I asked for extra harissa which gave the food a nice kick. I'm very hesitant to try thai dishes at a restaurant that isn't thai but I saw some of the dishes and they didn't look bad. Service was good. Suitable restaurant option for those who are kosher and want good food without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"This is a kosher restaurant. 
Came here for brunch. They specialize in Israeli and Thai food. 
We asked them to leave a pitcher of water on our table but had to remind them to keep refilling it. 
It's baby friendly as we left a baby bucket on the table. 
We got hummus with mushrooms on top for the table and asked for whole wheat pita. It was pretty good but a bit oily. Ask for less oily. 
I got the Shakshouka not spicy. It was good and I would order the same thing next time. But it is also way too saucy. 
The hubby got goat cheese salad with seared tuna. He said it was just ok. 
They don't have decaf coffee so had to go to Starbucks after down the street."}
