{"text":"The best thing about our meal there as our server, who was very good at his job! But the place is dirty. Every table had a thick built up grease covering, so thick people had scratched their initials in the grease! A good scrubbing is in order, to say the least. Food was okay, but not great. Will pass in the future."}
{"text":"Great little family style resteraunt   Good food and service typical place for hometown folk."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and it was a great start to my day. I got the eggs and corned beef hash and it was perfect with the home fry potatoes. Damn good coffee! The server was very friendly and I have to admit that I'm a sucker for waitresses that call everyone \"Hun\" or \"sweetie\". You'll get plenty of that here with smiles."}
{"text":"The food here is great. They  serve breakfast here all day. The staff is always kind and courteous. Their cheesecake will make you wanna come back everyday."}
{"text":"The Concord Family Diner is a great place for all hours of the day. They have a hardy traditional breakfast menu with big portions, exceptional lunch options, and a fantastic dinner menu. It was a regular stop for me and my friends during my college years in Concord. We ate there at least 3 times a week so I was able to sample a lot of what the menu had to offer.   While primarily southern comfort foods such as mashed potatoes and minute steak (a favorite of mine from the dinner menu) there is also a heavy Greek influence in there salads and lighter options.  The portions are also very large especially on the breakfast choices and dinner salads.   The atmosphere is traditional dinner with booth seating and a friendly staff of locals. What will really surprise you is how much energy a place like this can have at night, with a karaoke night that brings in a very diverse crowd with a decent bar selection.  This place has been and will continue to be a must stop for me when I visit NC for years to come"}
{"text":"I ate here four times. Two of those times the food was not fresh. One time they used stale bread for the French toast I ordered.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the area! If you like french toast, make sure to try their homemade egg batter toast. Food consistency is great, along with the service being consistent."}
{"text":"Went in with low expectations. Was very disappointed. Service was nonexistent. Gravy was so salty neither my son nor I could eat out meal. Beef was not cooked that day... Not even sure that week. Horrible.... A huge portion .... But inedible."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in at lunchtime last week and we both picked items from the \"specials of the day\" list.  I chose the fried chicken and my wife chose the chicken quesadilla.  The fried chicken arrived pretty quick, in about 10 minutes...I thought then that if the chicken were cooked fresh that there was no way that it would have been ready in that short of time.  First thing I immediately noticed was that there were no bones...hmm.  I did attempt to eat the chicken but it was obviously cooked previously and it was not good at all.  I was able to stomach the side dishes of fried okra and baked potato but those also were kept warm under lights I suspect.  My wife said that the chicken in her quesadilla did not taste like it was freshly cooked either.  I will probably not go back there for lunch or dinner based on this experience but I have eaten breakfast there several times and each time everything was pretty good."}
{"text":"Okay, the food was good and the prices were pretty reasonable. I had a gyro which was amazing, my mom had a chicken parm wrap which was great too. Their fries are not good at all (cold). The service was not good. It was rather empty for a Saturday afternoon but very little interaction with our waitress and the food took a while to be brought out. Also, I don't know how often the restaurant is thoroughly cleaned. Looking around while waiting for food really allowed me to notice how unswept the floors were. Overall, decent experience and I think I'd go again...skip the fries.  Edit: The menu is way too busy. There's entirely too many options which overwhelms the customer. I think they should do something about that."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful service, and a hometown feel. We will be back. Ask for Nay Nay."}
{"text":"Priced right, GREAT food, everything is fresh, and homemade! Don't miss the opportunity to get some hometown southern quality food!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat cheap and I hate everything. I always get the Seafood Special Platter. 2 large pieces of fried flounder. Comes with 2 sides (baked potato, fries, slaw, etc). The slaw is notably good. Best in Concord possibly. Service as some others have noted is hit or miss. Sometimes the server is good. Sometimes awful, but the food is good and prices are low. I had a $40 salmon dinner at 131 Main in Cornelius and it wasn't even close to this $9 meal. Go here for dessert selection (pies, cakes). This is one of the few places I eat in Concord or Concord Mills area. Good cheap place to eat and better than most all others in the low price range or fast food. This was a massive plate of food for less than what someone would pay for rat meat at McDonalds or Bojangles or Chick Fil A."}
{"text":"Good cheap food. I had a phenomenal breakfast."}
{"text":"The food was great, coffee strong,  and gravy thick... What more could this California boy ask for?"}
{"text":"While the diner has a decent atmosphere and was open on 1/1/16. We were disappointed in our meal. Service was quick, but by 12:00 they had run out of dark meat chicken and the meatloaf special was not.  Two decent sized slices of a very solid packed loaf. Not sure of the filler, maybe rice but it makes up at least 50% of the mix. Served with a couple nondescript gravies that do little to add anything to the flavor.  Again great service at a decent price, this time it was just a disappointment."}
{"text":"This place may not be for everyone, but I enjoy eating here. The service at times can be spotty, but the food tends to be consistent.  I LOVE the Cheescake that they had/have."}
{"text":"great diner, great spinach pie!! nice waitstaff  you feel like you are back in the 50s. Burgers decent, My husband loves the breakfast. good value for the money."}
{"text":"Not on my list anymore.  Service was slow and the entire order was slow to come out.  Everything tastes bland and had to send mine back and just ask for a simple dish."}
{"text":"The best food ever,  i just moved to the area and was looking for dinner to eat at. I passed by Concord dinner, I'm glad i stop to eat here. so pass in if you ever in Concord NC"}
{"text":"If I based this solely on food I would have to say a high three or maybe a low four star rating, but there were so many little problems that just lessened the overall experience it was teetering on two star territory.   Immediately upon walking in this place did not smell good. Not instantly being overwhelmed with a delicious aromas is fine, but this place smelled more like an old hardware store with a leaky roof. I'm not sure if it was just the age of the building or if there was a more serious issue but it was definitely noticeable.   Seated without issue, place wasn't very busy. The benches of the booths have definitely seen some miles, a little wobbly and some torn vinyl but not terribly uncomfortable. The overall aesthetic seemed to be that of a rundown diner with a coat of slightly more trendy diner painted over top. It just didn't seem to mesh with itself.  One of my biggest gripes was the menu and the fact that it was a colossal mess. It was physically large itself and on those 8 (four double sided) pages there were SO . . . MANY . . . DISHES. Seriously, look at the pictures. I have never seen a menu with so many words on it. They were crammed on there in a tiny font too. I'm sure there are places out there with a big team of chefs that can handle a menu like that, but typically quality suffers when you try to have your cooks memorize several dozen (low hundreds maybe?) different things.   I finally settled on a dish and once ordered I excused myself to the restroom where I was greeted with an even greater disparity in design than the main restaurant. It was just so . . . weird. The door into the room itself, as well as the wall and paneling surrounding said door were very clearly white painted plywood and were showing plenty of wear and the floor was moderately clean linoleum. That was paired with what appeared to be a brand new kohler sink, brand new brushed nickel faucet and a new paper towel dispenser. From chest height up there was beautiful tile and white walls, while from chest down the same semi clean linoleum on the floor covered the rest of the walls. It would all be forgivable if it was just an in between for updating the restroom but it seemed deranged and on purpose. Back to the table with washed hands.  Finally the part where I get to mention the nice things.  Our server whose name I unfortunately don't remember was wonderful. The sweet tea was on point and she always kept our glasses full of it. Never had to ask for extra napkins or straws and was super polite the whole while. We didn't have to wait long for the food either, another plus. My dish itself while not world class was a welcome surprise, especially after the experience up to this point. I ordered the Gyro Pita and it was actually quite flavorful. Soft but slightly toasted pita bread, good seasoning on the meat, came out piping hot. Fries tasted like they might be frozen but they were at least warm and crispy.   I'm torn because this place didn't really make me want to come back, but I also feel like cutting the menu in half and taking about a week to clean and remodel would really make this place shine. I don't wish any ill will on them but I hope they take the time and effort to step up their game."}
{"text":"I used to come here anytime I was in town and loved the biscuits and gravy and service was very good. Well the wife and I stopped for breakfast and were quite disappointed. First, we were sat away from everyone else. The coffee came quickly but we did not see our server and when we asked the hostess she gave a very  nonchalant ok. The food quality sucked, the biscuits and gravy were edible bit the gravy was too floury and the gravy was cold and lacked sausage. My wife ordered home fries and it was a mixture of cold and over done. The service was below par and overall I will not be back."}
{"text":"Food is good but the place is old and dirty.  If you can overlook that then you'll get a good meal."}
{"text":"You really have to wonder about people...  This place is a dive. Food is mediocre at best, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it's also a bar, and so you can order beer with your eggs at 6:30am (if you're into that). TV blaring 24-hour news (murder, murder, murder, rape, murder) with three families including several small kids, doughy french toast, bacon that was manufactured instead of off of the hog, sausage gravy that is 99% white flour, 1% sausage. Also note that the location is NOT where it says it is in Google Maps via Yelp! App. for iPhone."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that inspired me to join Yelp and write a review.  I recently took my family to Great Wolf Lodge and looked on Yelp for a good breakfast joint to take the family.  After some looking, we decided on the Concord Family Diner.  The reviews were pretty good, except for David L who gave it two stars.  Here are my thoughts:  1) Dirtiness.  I get that it is a dive, but there were crumbs and stains on the booths, the floors and the bathrooms (men and womens) were FILTHY at 9am on a Sunday morning.  The plate they brought out my kid's cereal bowl had some type of yellow powder dried into it.  I am a pretty low key guy and love a dive restaurant and am pretty forgiving of minor stuff, but the overall impression this left was of a place who did not care very much about their business or customers.  2) Service.  The waitress took our order and then forgot about us.  Over 30+ minutes, I flagged down another waitress who was doing coffee refills and asked about our order.  About 5 minutes later, the meals came about with a couple exemptions.  They forgot my wife's toast that came with her omelette and forgot my kids had each ordered bowls of cereal.  Our waitress came back and expressed frustration with the kitchen when she delivered the food, but clearly something was wrong when people who got there after us got their food and had left.  3) Food quality.  My wife liked her omelette, saying it was tasty and that goes a long way even if it was a little cold.  My pancakes and bacon were both cold enough to qualify as barely warm.  The bacon was good - its bacon - and crispy the way I like it.  It would have been perfect if served warm.  My pancakes were not good at all.  Pretty much ice cold, they were tough to cut, had a nasty chewy consistency, and for the first time in my life I just said I will pass on the pancakes.  I ate the bacon and a piece of her toast and a cup of coffee.  Given the experience, I did not ask for a remake or something else and just paid and left.  Despite the positive reviews, I would suggest people skip this place and fine somewhere else.  The combination of dirtiness (the big one for me), slow service, server-kitchen issues, and inedible pancakes tell me I would have been better off eating at a place like Denny's which I normally avoid on principle."}
{"text":"Concord Family Diner is the epitome of a good mom and pop dive diner. Great food in large portions with a small price. I frequent this place for breakfast a lot. Mostly because the food is great but also because breakfast is served all day. A rarity for Concord. Their home fries are very delicious and very plentiful ( I can rarely finish them). I highly recommend the Farmers Omelet. It's as if you went to your garden and picked every vegetable you had and mixed it in with 5 eggs! Yum!. Other favorites include the Bacon/Cheese Omelet, French Toast and their bacon is even delicious!   For Dinner, I recommend the Broiled Fish ( As my quote states, I like food deep fried... but not always), an unsuspecting treat. I won't quite say that it's healthy just because it's broiled but very tasty all the same. Their burgers are good and so is their other fish entrees. I would steer away from the Quesadillas but to me you don't go to an American-Greek restaurant and expect good Mexican fare. They do offer daily specials (about 10) on top of their vast menu. I have yet to be adventurous enough to try some of them.   Dessert: They have a lot of pies and cakes to choose from. I will routinely get their NY Cheesecake. One slice is plenty for 2 people. They tease you with their desserts in the refrigerated Carousel right when you walk in the door to get your taste buds excited.   I will say that I avoid their Karaoke nights due to the crowd and not so pleasant vocal stylings. Best to avoid those nights and stick to dinner and breakfast."}
{"text":"The food was okay, general type breakfast food. The service was slow, extremely slow. I wouldn't recommend this place as a 1st choice but more of a second or third.   It seems that since the place has been under new management, the quality of food and service had declined."}
{"text":"Great family food! Had a chicken souvlaki pita, others had lasagna. Wonderful and affordable."}
{"text":"Service was great and food was ok. A bit to greasy for my liking. Also the place could use a decor update, sprucing up."}
{"text":"Staff is hit or miss.   We have our favorite waitresses though.   Portions are huge.   You will never leave here hungry.   The desserts turning in the case by the door truly are as amazing as they look!   From pie to cheesecake,  whatever variety you can dream up,  take a slice to go if you are too full!  Could use a remodel but I don't go there for the furniture."}
{"text":"Quality food...quaint with nice ambiance but very dirty...bathrooms are off the charts gross and the WAIT is WAY TOO LONG. My daughter and I uses to like to go here for breakfast on Sun but the wait was OVER AND HOUR AFTER OUR ORDER WAS TAKEN...gave it one more shot and same thing happened so we got up and left."}
{"text":"Everything here is good. Do not think I have ever had anything that was great but have never been disappointed . I would definitely recommend CFD for anyone."}
{"text":"Due to a wreck of some sort, I-85 was at a stand still. We where on our way to Panther Stadium To see N.C. State play in Belk Bowl. Our plans where to eat in one of the Triple D's down town. So we ended up coming in thru Salisbury to Concord the old way. My oldest son was familiar with this place, We all thought the old diner look was cool.Old pictures of Lucy, the Beatles and other old stars,little what knots in the windows. A very Full menu from breakfast to wraps of all kinds. Breakfast is served all day. a small amount of seafood, Italian, a little Greek. not much of a reason to go home hungry. The decor was of old style drive-in from way on back. I had breakfast.My wife had meatloaf and a salad. Huge portions of food. One son had soup, another had country steak and mashed potatoes, plus green beans. Again huge portions. One of our friends had the BBQ chicken wrap and fries. Service was OK. If your party was in need of a beverage the bar looked open. I think every one was content when we departed for our game. {which State Won..} A good evening in deed.. All most forgot the deserts are greeting you when come in the door. A Red Velvet cake, chocolate and lemon meringue pie MMmmm.."}
{"text":"Older diner. Had some charm, but, needs a good cleaning and some repairs. Even just a cleaning would be ok.  They were doing some work in the back while we were there.  We both had breakfast. I had the thick french toast with bacon. Toast was good at first, but, I picked up some after taste.  Bacon was greasy, but, good flavor.  Would have preferred it be more crispy.  Husband had omelet. Slightly overcooked, but, ok.  They did have a lot of good looking desserts, but, did not partake tonight.    Waitress was very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Their Greek salad salad dressing might as well be marketed as lip balm. That salad was swimming in it."}
{"text":"New name - Concord Diner. Similar menu. Great meals tonight. Chicken Dijon was amazing. Big portion of chicken. Chicken Alfred flavorful. Yero was great. Chicken sandwich was great. Roles were soft. Great service. Happy!"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices. I went with the morning special, the home made sweetbread French toast. Excellent. MaryAnn, my server, was courteous and attentive. I looked at the lunch and dinner menus and saw a wide variety of foods that would appeal to different taste buds. I'll be checking that out soon! Noosh!"}
{"text":"I came for the Charlotte Spring car show and visited this place due to my buddy saying how good and big the meals are.  Incredibly good tasting food. Tasted home made, as if nothing was ever frozen. Service was great, quick and good smiles.  The New Orleans chicken was so good!  The bread could've been better but that's just nitpicking.  The Dynamic Due was also very good.  Service was also fast and constant even while having a full house and short one person.  Great place, looking forward to fall when I come back up that way."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in Concord Family Diner today.  Was suppose to cater for a JROTC field day for over 225 kids and failed to do so because they wrote down the wrong date.  So, 225 local students didn't get fed lunch today.  The last few times we have been there food quality has declined as well but when I heard this it showed me management really doesn't care."}
{"text":"Not  good.  Fam restaurant.  The master of none is a good adjective.  All kinds of food but nothing really sticks out."}
{"text":"This place was a big surprise, its an older building been there forever doesnt look like much from the outside. When you walk in kinda has a 50-60s diner vibe to it, menu is great, I had chicken pasta which was mind blowing. If your looking for desserts my god this place will blow you away."}
{"text":"very delicious and large portions. good comfort food. cute little diner atmosphere and nice staff. awesome cheesecake!! open late for a yummy late night meal. would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss here, but the food is excellent. Large menu...large portions...my kind of place! The ambiance is definitely lacking, but once you get over that and focus on the delicious grub you won't be disappointed. The hot open faced roast beef sandwich is the best I've ever had. My other favorite is a dish called Pasta Fazoo, and my husband loves their Chicken Parmesan. Most of the time we get so much food we have leftovers for the next day. The prices are very fair for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the reviews. Yes, portions are huge. The food is pretty inedible though. Service was good, and they did take my meal off the check."}
{"text":"Stopped in because of previous comments on Yelp and found a great menu variety. If you cannot find something delicious on the menu - then you have to look a little harder. Samantha - our server - made the meal an experience. From shrimp scampi to lasagna to chicken noodle soup - all tasty. Chocolate peanut butter cheesecake was perfect to finish the meal. I could have \"hugged\" the pie case and tried at least seven other tasty desserts."}
{"text":"Great food. Interesting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Love this place, go here a lot, it's right around the corner from me. I always get the Chicken or Steak quesadillas! They're so delicious, my favorite thing on the menu along with their Fries which are also great! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Service was great.  If I lived in the area I'd eat here 4 days a week.  Had the open face roast beef sandwich w/ real mashed potatoes and my friend had the calabash basket.  Portions were huge and it was all good.  My regret is that as I was leaving, I saw the desserts and I was kicking myself for not saving room for pie.  I hope they have the coconut custard pie next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a rather late dinner. I appreciate diners with character, but this one is clearly in need of a face lift. The seats and tables were clearly old and in need of reupholstery and or replacement. The floors also seemed like they needed a good polish and buff. The service was good and the food was decent. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. Would like to come back and try their breakfast, as this is what most diners are known for."}
{"text":"Been a fan of Concord Family Diner since high school. Absolutely love the Pasta Fazool. Never have had a bad meal, breakfast (offer huge portions) or dinner. The desserts are homemade and delicious. The owners, Pete & Gus, are awesome and friendly.  Sure the place is old and outdated and I've thought about calling Robert Irvin from Restaurant Impossible to ask him to help with a renovation. Besides that, its a great dive spot to get a good meal (American, Italian, Greek)"}
{"text":"Not good my buddy a vendor delivery driver said if you saw the kitchen and the way they conduct them selves you would not eat there. The food has gone down hill in the past two years and does the wait staff have to all be gay?"}
{"text":"It might be a dive but it's good food! I thought the place ad a lot of character. There is a bar to the left of the tables but no one drinking. There were 2 TVs on above the bar but they weren't blaring. Some of the vinyl seats had rips and the floors looked like they could be a bit cleaner but we were there for the food and have no complaints. Portions were great, so we're prices and they had scratch made biscuits. Our server was very nice too. Health score was 95 - pretty good for a diner!"}
{"text":"Today was our second and hopefully last time eating here. Wife and I stopped for breakfast here only because we were in the area, were hungry, and did want fast food. Shortly after taking our order our sever brought us the bill saying she had to go pick up another server for her shift. After a decent wait considering they were not that busy at 10am another server brought us our food. Food here is ok ,but not great and a little on the pricey side. Ordered a country ham and egg sandwich with mustard and it came without any. Wasn't checked on or offered refills until our glasses had been empty for sometime.  After finishing breakfast we waited a while till I had to flag down a server to get a to go box and cups. Next time we are in the area and hungry, I hope we find another option. Food and service here are just not worth another visit."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its name as a family restaurant. The time we came in was for breakfast. Lots of Seniors were here, quiet, low murmuring, with a television playing in the background . Kathy Lee and Micheal Stratton type shows.  Nice experience, slow laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great diner, and with all the greek staples too! Burger was great! Love the diner atmosphere and the cakes looked amazing. I will definitely be coming back here."}
