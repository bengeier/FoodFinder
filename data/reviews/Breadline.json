{"text":"When the standard greasy fast food fare just won't \"cut the mustard\" for you, Breadline is a safe harbour in the downtown food court chaos.  Located on the +15 concourse of 5th Avenue Place, Breadline is open for breakfast and lunch weekdays.  Of particular interest to you should be the Turkey Cranberry Sub - lean turkey with cranberry chutney, swiss cheese, and topped with caramelized onions, served on a nice, fresh, crispy baguette. C'est magnifique! If you only ask for a half sub, the price tag is under $4.  Make sure you get there between 11:30 - 12:30 before they run out of pre-made sandwiches, because then you have to wait in line at the Customized Sandwiches counter to have it made for you.  If you're not in a \"fowl\" mood, there are a variety of other pre-made sandwiches to choose from, as well as a wide array of vegetable and pasta salads, three daily soup options, and lemon meringue pie for dessert.  The Breadline is always busy, has a very friendly staff, and the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"For now I'm going to give Breadline 3 stars mainly because what I received for a sandwich today terrible.  First of all, I have gone here several times already and usually the service is great, the food is good and I don't have any complaints besides the fact that communication could be a little better at this establishment.  I usually order the turkey bacon club on a toasted baguette loaded with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, alfalfa sprouts, bit of mayo and butter and away we go. It always goes out fresh, you watch them make it and like I said I can't really complain.  However, today when we ordered the same thing we always order the one lady toasted slices of bread instead of a baguette. Secondly, when requested baguettes she used some 2 inch wide skinny baguette that they never use there.  I mean, I looked at the confusion on her face when she was trying to put all the above items onto the baguette, she didn't know what to do or how to keep the items on the baguette from falling over cause there was practically no room to put anything on it!"}
{"text":"I agree with Jason G.  This place serves really good and fresh hand-made sandwiches.  I always get their Egg Salad on Multi-Grain.    NB - they also serve Vietnamese Subs and it's quite popular.  I haven't tried it but I always see people ordering the subs."}
