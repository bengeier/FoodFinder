{"text":"Top notch... Hands down best poke bowl spot in AZ! Exceeded my expectations. Fish is super fresh, good portions, nice decor and staff is great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service- as soon as you walk in the staff including management welcomes you and takes the time to explain the food! The fish is so fresh and I have lived overseas so I know when I am getting quality fish. The poke is delicious with wonderful options for toppings. I have already been to this location three times this week and will continue to make it my favorite healthy spot to dine"}
{"text":"If you go to Poke Bar up the road, come here instead. I thought I'd give Koi Poke a try today, and WOW, was I impressed. First the customer service is top notch. Friendly people all the way down the line. Even offered up a free sample without even asking for it. The bowl is insanely better tasting than Poke Bar. Not sure what it is, but they just won me over. Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had the 2 scoop bowl with salmon and Hawaiian tuna.  The salmon was buttery and delicious!  The tuna had a very tasty sauce with some basil added in.  I got a few of the toppings and with tip it was about $12.  It was almost more food than I could eat but it was delicious and the restaurant seemed clean.  Staff seemed friendly too"}
{"text":"By far the best Poke in the area. Everyone is very friendly and always helpful if you need recommendations on combinations to try. I would recommend the Hawaiian Tuna Mix they have. Not only is it delicious but it is very fresh as well. It has been very clean the two times I've been so far. I will continue to come during my lunch break at work and recommend to anybody who is looking for some killer poke."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The fish is so fresh and they are not stingy on their portions. I was even able to sample the different fish. One of the best things about this place is the customer service, which is perfect. Every time I've come here I am taken care of. Everyone I've met is genuinely friendly. I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I just visited this new location at Gainey Village and was wondering if they would actually be able to execute as well as they have at their first two locations. Sure enough, it was just as good as the others. In fact, it was EXACTLY the same which is all I could ask for. Same super fresh fish, great attitude/service and the place is uber clean. This is now my favorite location and  I think it's probably the nicest inside although they all look basically the same. They have the snow ice here (they don't at the Arcadia store) which is also nice.  My only (temporary) complaint is they don't have alcohol yet but they say it's on the way!"}
{"text":"I am loving this new poke place! We came in a received samples of the different pokes before ordering. The server was so nice, we even got to try some of the different sauces. I like the fact that you can customize your bowl with all of the toppings.  I ended up getting a Small poke bowl with 2 servings of fish. The fish was fresh and they had many different sauces to add. The server was so friendly he even picked up our trays when we were done eating. It's a great quick and healthy spot to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Yummy  food ! Service was great Griifin is a superstar. Kid got me to buy lobster for the first time was definitely worth the upcharge !  Koi doesn't seem to miss !"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place. The food is in good portions and the food is very fresh. I am a first time reviewer and food was so tasty it compelled me to write a review. It is trendy"}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite places to eat. The quality of the food is so fresh and amazing that it's funny that it's served in a plastic bowl. I'm so glad this place is open near my house!"}
{"text":"Stopped by and YES! It's finally open! The space was very clean. The staff super friendly. Most importantly, the seafood is fresh! My husband and I had totally different bowls and we both agreed everything was very good. Bonus - beer, wine and sake coming soon!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! First experience with Poke was amazing! Everything was fresh and staff super nice. Highly recommend this place. Wish they could come to East Valley but in the meantime we will do the drive to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this new location. The detail the feeling i got walking in was very cool. Looking forward to keep coming back daily. Poke is in my life routine and this place is beyond top notch. That Hawaiian tuna reminds me of best poke shack in Hawaii. The real crab in the crab mix is another detail that keeps this place above the others. Keep it up Koi Poke"}
{"text":"Came in with a group of friends for a healthy lunch and we were not disappointed. They had a great selection of fish, sauces and toppings. I got a small bowl with brown rice, Hawaiian poke and spicy tuna with shoyzu sauce. They had a large selection of toppings but I kept it simple with seaweed salad, cucumbers, edamame, wasabi and avocado. We sat and ate, while we were eating one of the employees came over and asked if we wanted anything else and brought over extra sauce! Then he came back once we were done and took our trays away. Excellent service! The restaurant was big, lots of seating and clean."}
{"text":"First of all I would like to say that I have left Ahi Poke Bowl for this place. Nothing compares to the service , how fresh the fish is , and how clean this place is. The vibe is so different and the design is absolutely beautiful. I am so happy I know what real Hawaiian tuna tastes like. Today I went there and I didn't ask her name but it was this blonde employee with pink and silver fake nails. She has helped me many times and I haven't gotten to praise her yet. Every time I have came in there she has been so kind and patient even if there is a huge line, there is always a smile on her face , and this company should be happy to have an employee like her. All I can say is thank god you guys made this location because I was driving so far to the other ones. Every time I have been to Koi poke the service, food , and sanitation never differs between store to store. Coming from someone that is extremely picky I know what's up. Overall amazing and best sauces are SPICY SHOYU."}
{"text":"First time here and the poke was good. Got the salmon and the Hawaiian tuna poke with spring mix salad along with seaweed salad and topped with spicy shoyu, sriracha aioli and chili lime sauces. It's a good informal place for lunch or dinner. It looks like they have space for a bar but currently there's no alcohol. The customer service was also really good."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a poke place coming into Gainey village to provide another lunch option for those who work nearby. 

The space is really nice, new, and was super clean. If you've been to other poke places, you know the drill. You select what items you'd like and they build your bowl in front of you. You pay up front and then you can select where you sit. Both people working were very friendly and walked us through their offerings since we hadn't been there before. 

I got a small bowl with white rice, salmon and tuna, cucumber, seaweed salad, masago, crab salad, red onion and house sauce. Fish tasted fresh and overall the bowl was pretty solid. My bowl came out to about $11 with tax added. 

While it was good, I prefer another place close by because of their sauce flavors and the fact that it's a couple of dollars cheaper. Just my personal preference though. 

My only other comment was around the time it took to complete my bowl. Perhaps they were just short staffed, but the person to add your toppings also had to cash you out, so there's some waiting time as they go back and forth. Other places are more efficient so you are through the line super quickly. Not a deal breaker, just an observation. 

If you've never had poke before though, this is a good place to start."}
{"text":"What a refreshing surprise  to find a super efficient staff that does a greAt job explaining  how the menu works.  I ordered a medium bowl and got to choose three different generous helpings of fish. I love the atmosphere the food and the staff !!! Great job and how nice to have healthy food available so quickly!!  Great for a tight schedule and to maintain a healthy lifestyle!"}
