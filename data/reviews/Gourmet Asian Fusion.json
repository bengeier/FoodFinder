{"text":"I chose this restaurant as all AYCE place to go for a couple. My expectations were not very high, but in the end we have been a few times now so it was worth returning to.   I find the service to be usually fast, and cordial. There are variations though and I remember the first time we went the place was full and it was hard to find a waiter for the second order.   For the dishes, there was a nice variety. We really enjoyed the tangy General Tao Chicken and the surprisingly tasty Ginger and Shallots Shrimp. I think the Sesame Beef was decent as well.   I must say the service and food seemed much better on our third visit - the restaurant was very quiet and you can tell everything was really made to order. All in all, I recommend this BYOW."}
{"text":"Not fancy fine, but not bad at all, especially with the weekday $20 all you can eat option and the beloved magic of BYO. I love bringing my own and eating all I can!   Avoid the Pad Thai, that's not what that's supposed to taste like, but the red curry veg and sesame beef were very tasty! The service was smiling, friendly and prompt and kept the clean plates and napkins coming, which is thoughtful in the all you can eat experience. The location is great, sitting in the window watching the ebb and flow from the countless BYO's on Duluth and St Denis. The bathrooms are just a tinch ghetto, but not terrifying."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars, and I look forward to coming back. Good value, nice variety, and great service.  All up it ended costing us less than $30 per person, which for the amount and quality of food, was great value. It fits in the \"cheap and cheerful\" category for me. The decor was on the fancy side of things, but not over-the-top - it would be just as good for a date as a group of friends.  I found the service here to be very good. The waiter told us to order what we wanted, and he would bring out enough for our group, and the quantities ended up being pretty much spot-on! I think there was a little bit left of each dish, but not enough to be wasteful, and nobody missed out on anything. I know it's a small thing, but they also brought out napkins while we were eating - nobody does that! As a messy (ie. MANLY) eater, I definitely appreciated it (and I'm sure my girlfriend did too, for her sake).  As another reviewer mentioned; this place is a BYOW, and there's a SAQ about 15m down the road, which makes it quick and easy to keep the bill down."}
{"text":"Solid 3 Stars            We frequented here a little while ago with the BYOW crowd(which if you are not a part of, what is your problem?) for an onslaught of all the 'staples'. General Tao, Hunan dumplings, crispy beef, fried spinach, summer rolls, we had a bit of everything and for the most part it was all pretty good and you can't beat the price...except the pad thai...don't get the pad thai.          Add the BYO concept and you have the makings for a solid night out with friends tat won't break the bank.  waka waka"}
{"text":"Je suis toujours un peu sceptique des restaurants asiatiques à Montréal, surtout avec le mot \"fusion\". Celui-ci, n'est pas si pire. Puisque c'est un apportez votre vin ET un buffet en même temps, ils gagnent pas mal de morceaux de robots, simplement pour le concept. En plus, on était bien assis, super bien servis et la bouffe était bonne. J'ai préféré le cari rouge mais le buf au sésame et le général tao n'était pas pire non plus. J'ai été surprise par les épinards croustillants. C'était une première pour moi, et bien que ça se prenne bien en entrée, j'aurais presque préféré ça comme dessert. Oui, des épinards comme dessert!"}
