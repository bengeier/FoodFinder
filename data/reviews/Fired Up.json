{"text":"My wife and I were very excited to try Fired Up since it opened. We made our reservations for 7:30pm and showed up on time on a Saturday night. As we entered we noted the great energy and decor. This is where it started to go downhill. We saw a long line of people and thought well we're glad we have reservations! We were told that our table will be ready 'shortly' and that there was no place for us to wait in the restaurant and that we have to wait outside (in the cold) or go for a drink elsewhere while we wait. We got to learn that everyone waiting actually had reservations! They over booked the place! What upset me was that at 8pm another party who seem to know the owner had a reservation at 8 and were seated right away with complete disregard to us and everyone who's been waiting for a long time. That was totally rude. After waiting for about 45mins, we get a table.   The food menu is limited but interesting. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and it was good. The mains were a big problem. My wife had the grilled swordfish, which was stone cold when served. I don't mean room temperature, I mean 'straight out of the fridge' cold. I ordered the venison chops which were bland and undercooked (served room temperature - I'm being generous).   Overall the vibe is nice but the way we were treated was not welcoming at all and the food was mediocre at best. At these prices, we expect more. The only salvation for that place was our fantastic waiter, Tom, who was very friendly and personable.   An overpriced, mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend. We got the grilled calamari, half rack pork ribs with mashed potatos and corn, and the beef skewers with rice and vegetables, and a salad. The grilled calamari was one of the best I've ever had and very tender.  The salad was amazing too, very fresh.  However, the beef skewers turned out to be very tough and chewy, we weren't able to finish eating them.  We were originally hesitant to eat here because of the bad reviews.  I would have gave it 5 stars if it wasn't for the terrible beef skewers. The service was average. The decor and atmosphere was warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Dropped by at 12:15 for lunch, only to be told they don't open until 4 p.m.  Posted everywhere that they open at 12 noon.  Disappointing. Time to update your website"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, I ordered the Black Angus burger which was okay I would rather spend that $18 at McDonald's on a Big Mac though."}
{"text":"Bad experience, too pricy for cheap quality food !!! The quantity isn't as great as well !!!! Staff aren't too friendly , didn't like how the server treated us, he never brought me the drink I asked for and didn't check on our table!! Bad experience, not doing this again!!"}
{"text":"This place is over rated. We waited an hour for take out of ribs, a Cobb salad and crawfish soup. The place was packed! We had high expectations given the crowd we've seen in the place every time we drive by. But the food was very mediocre. The Cobb salad was missing egg and the avocados were rock hard. The ribs were ok, not great, and the corn on the cob was  raw. The coleslaw also tasted off. The crawfish soup, baked beans, and chicken on the salad was nice, but nothing special. Disappointing for sure."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I gave a restaurant, especially a highly anticipated new hotspot, this low of a rating. And even though I waited (you know to cool down and reflect) I still can't seem to avoid my disappointment at Fired Up!  When I read bad reviews about a place I usually look at how many reviews the reviewer has posted. If I see one or two, then I know they just had a bad experience and wanted to tell the world. If I see 50 or more reviews, then I assume that the reviewer has been to a few places and is probably a better judge of a place.   I read a lot of bad reviews about Fired Up!including an unbearable amount of heat and smoke inside, bad service and bad food. And in order to fare better than some of the early adopters, I waited a few weeks to give them a chance to work out the kinks. Now I can accurately report that the \"kinks\" have not been worked out. However, much of the problem really falls under Service 101.   We got lucky and were allowed to sit at a nice table for two on the patio. I was happy since it was a beautiful night out and sitting outside eliminated the remarks about unbearable heat inside (It is also very loud inside) Unfortunately that was as good as it got.   We ordered a simple meal including a full rack of ribs, a house poutine and a couple of sides. We were enjoying the outdoor breeze and chillin while waiting for the food. Close to 35 minutes later, the table beside us had ordered, got their meal and were paying. We had not received anything yet. When I asked the waitress she said \"it's the ribs, they take 30-45 minutes. Sorry\".   OK Service 101 goes like this....\" Hi, welcome to Fired Up! Is this your first time here? I just wanted to mention that the ribs are taking 30-45 minutes tonight\". To which we would have replied, \"OK, can we get an appetizer while we wait?\" More money for the restaurant and a more tolerable customer because they're not starving.   Instead, we placed the order, were told nothing and after 35 minutes and \"hey, where's our meal? We're famished\", we got some bread. The ribs came out after 45 minutes. They were dry and luke warm. Really? Yes, really.   After attacking the ribs, I realized we had not received our house poutine. That took and hour to come out. And after complaining about that, one of the owners came over, said that he agreed with me (that the customer engagement was horrible) and offered to cover the poutine.   It seems that if you want to be successful in Port Credit, all you need to do is score a location with a patio. That alone will fill your restaurant. Forget service and forget good food. It took many years for Snug Harbour to be less \"smug\" and at this rate it will take Fired Up! forever. But in the meantime, if you want to be part of a hip crowd you gotta go there.   If you really have to go, I would recommend the following:  A) get a seat on the patio, if weather permits.  B) Ask what appetizer you can get quickly C) stay away from the ribs  When you're sitting on a patio on a beautiful evening, with drinks, there's not much that can go wrong.  However Fired Up! managed to find a way. They also offered me a free salad, desert or side on my next visit. That was quite presumptuous. The only resolution that would have me coming back was for the owner to simply comp the meal.   There are many better places to spend an evening than at Fired Up!  However due to all the hype, you just have to learn first hand."}
{"text":"Friendly server, great location, BAD food. We got the meat platter. It has Half Rack of Ribs, Assorted Chubby Sausage and Lamb Chops. The only semi-decent meat on the platter was the half rack of ribs. Although I've had much better at a Rib fest. The sausages were completely dry. The lamb Chops were extremely rare, raw really. We told our server because she asked us to give them feedback.  She was very nice about it and said she'd get us a new cooked set of lamb Chops but came back in 5 minutes saying the kitchen insists we just cook the ones we brought you. They re-cooked it but it came back basically the same way it was. Except this time we also got some attitude from the manager/owner. As if we were unsophisticated diners who knew nothing about how meat is supposed to be cooked. I don't suppose it should be mooing when you serve it though! Really did not have a good experience with the food."}
{"text":"I agree with the 1-2 star comments.  This place LOOKS good, but the food is nowhere near as good as the restaurants decorative trimmings (I sat outside)! I only wish I had read these reviews before eating there and spending just under $100 on a meal that I could have prepared myself.  Serving food that is spoiled is not cool.  This was my first and last visit."}
{"text":"We visited on Saturday April 15th, 2017 for dinner. I don't know why people are saying the portions are small, because they are NOT small. It is regular to large size portions, in fact, two out of three in our party packed our main course leftovers for home.  Also, I looked around the room at other tables to see the dishes we didn't order and their portion sizes were decent.  For Starters we had Bloomin onion (smaller than Outback's version yet good) and a bowl of tomato soup (I thought it tasted like marinara sauce). For main courses, I had the Grilled Whole Sea Bream white fish served with vegetables and basmati rice. It was a good thick piece of fish but be careful of tiny bones. My hubby had the delicious meaty Beef Short Ribs on top of a mound of garlic mash potatoes. We both had leftovers. And my daughter had BBQ Pork Ribs served with chili, corn salsa and fries which she enjoyed and finished. Dessert was one piece of their homemade Cheesecake shared between three of us. Americano is only coffee served and it is strong and frothy. I took one star off because it took almost one hour before we got our main dishes and there is only metered street parking. Credit Cards are accepted."}
{"text":"Tonight (Saturday), we didn't have reservations and it was first come first serve.  We learned this restaurant opened six weeks ago.  We don't live in the area.  At 6:00 pm, it was a 90 minute wait to get an outdoor patio table for two.  The hostess was pleasant and apologetic for our wait and quietly got the owner to  leap frog us over two other groups and got us a table beside a table reserved for friends of the owner on the patio.  After we were seated, we ordered our burgers.  It was a 30 minute wait for our food!  We were starving.  Then the burgers arrived.  Mine was correct.  My spouse received the wrong burger.  Therefore another 5 minute wait for her burger.  Our server Chris was below average and he favoured other tables by asking if they wanted ground pepper and refilled their water glasses.  He ignored our table and we had to ask for the ground pepper and also repeatedly for hot water.  His attitude towards us seemed to be discriminatory.  In fact, he appeared to be not all there.  The owner sat next to our table with his preferred guests and he was nothing more than a schmoozer to them.  Ugh!  The burgers were excellent and are the best we have tasted for the price.  Then, I asked for the bill.  My spouse was charged for a more expensive venison burger rather than for her wild boar burger.  The WiFi credit card machine had a fixed 18% and 20% gratuity choice.  I wanted to leave a smaller % tip.  There was the other option of opting out and paying the tip with cash.  But, I bit the bullet and paid the lower 18% tip because the food made up for the wait and lousy service from the server.  My spouse said she would return.  I have mixed feelings on returning.  Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"The place look really nice inside however, the food did not match i tied the lamb burger which sounded great but it was over ran with goat cheese and was over killed with way to many species.   The service was ok but we waited over 15 to pay for reasons that I am not sure about.    And let me not forget to mention(not entirely the restaurants fault) but the guy at the table beside me tock his shoes off and was walking around in his dirty socks.   Overall a below average experience and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The place is absolutely stunning. Food was OK. We had the burgers and they were kind of small considering the price($22). The starter was good we had the mushrooms portebello. We waited a but more than I would have liked.  My boyfriend looved his cocktail. Mine...could have been colder but it was good."}
{"text":"I went here today with my boyfriend and would have liked to have tasted the food if it didn't take an hour to get to some service!!!   They seem to not care about customer service what-so-ever!  Someone needs to tell the manager a thing or two about how to please the paying customer and be more selective in the hiring process of his idiotic waitresses!!  Got up and left before ordering food.  Won't return or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Went today for Mothers Day with reservations no issues being seated on time no issues with food but thats where it all ends. I have never encountered such bad service in my entire life! We were rushed out of our table to make room for another reservation. If we had been told a time limit when making the reservation it would have been conpletely fine! The owner of the restaurant tried to brush this situation off with some desert but frankly we declined as we had all lost any remaining appetite! Thanks  but I will never go back!"}
{"text":"First off, the decor and environment is wonderful. I came for dinner around 8, and they keep it a little dim and it feels very relaxed inside. The decor is rustic with some nicer polished touches. The menu has some items that are less common in Mississauga restaurants, like venison and kangaroo, which was refreshing to see.   We ordered the truffle fries for a whopping $19, shared between three people. They were good and the portion was good for three people. I understand truffle oils are expensive but the $19 was absurd in retrospect.   My party ordered the piri piri chicken, caesar salad with some chicken added, and I ordered the beef skewers with potato medallions and vegetables. All of us were happy enough with our entrees but I found it unfortunate that they cook the beef skewers well done. I don't like wasting otherwise edible food so I didn't send it back. Our server was excellent and she made sure our glasses were never empty.   For dessert, we couldn't decide between the chocolate mousse cake, red velvet cake, or apple caramel cheesecake, which were all made in house. We ordered all three and really loved all three. None were too sweet (like comparable la rocca cakes from the grocery store, which are usually my favourite) and they were very delicious.   Overall, many of the items I find are overpriced but you're also paying for the environment. I would go back here again for the experience and to try better menu items."}
{"text":"Well I will start off with the bad.  1) they leave the windows at the front open because of the grill so the temperature inside the restaurant would easily be 40 degrees. It was 33 outside today and I was comfortable and didn't break a sweat walking around. Sitting waiting for water I started to pour sweat. I lived in Dubai for 2.5 years and not even on a patio did I have this problem. On this alone I would avoid coming here unless you can get a patio seat. 2) the Caesar salad is the saddest joke of a salad I have ever had. It was a pathetic lump of wilted lettuce full of the cheaper centre filler pieces with a lump of cheese on the side and randomly squirted dressing   Now the good. 1) best Mac and cheese I have had ever 2) the service was fast, polite and friendly  3) the wild boar burger was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing 3)the stuff chicken was excellent   But seriously get some AC in there"}
{"text":"I remember when this place used to be a pizza spot and then a Greek spot but when I saw the transformation again it had me very curious.   The renovations were well done and the decor is a dimly lit, refined rustic feel. Open kitchen concept has the dining room feeling very warm.   Staff was good, server's knowledge of menu and food preparation was novice and possibly attributed to her inexperience in that restaurant. When she revisited us after our food came out she was genuinely concerned about our experience and did take note of our concerns; directed them to the appropriate people.   We ordered the cheesy bread loaf with an out of place tomato salad mixture as a topping. My wife is not a fan of tomato so we had them put in on the side. Man am I glad it was separated. One word. SALTY.  I don't think the cook tasted his mix before sending out the food. The server even tried some of the mix and agreed with me.   Onto the ribs. DISAPPOINTED. The ribs were lukewarm, DRY and lacking taste. I asked if they were braised in the oven to which the server replied that they were cooked in a convection oven - verbatim from the chef.  I was expecting a nice BBQ. Side of baked beans was a waste of space. You could probably crack open a can of Heinz beans and get better results. Their side of coleslaw was equally tasteless. Oily version, which I don't mind, but it was messy, lacked the essential spice and ingredients that make coleslaw good. Both my wife and I had the ribs and they both came with side of corn on the cob. AWFUL. Must've been made at 9am.  Dry, mushy, and cold.    We did voice our concerns while the food was still on the table. Manager offered a complimentary gelato. No thanks. We'd seen and tried enough.   When the bill was presented it looked as if we had zero concerns about food and it's quality - catch my drift?  Manager made my wife feel uncomfortable by sitting beside her with his arm around the back of her seat. He eventually understood what we felt with the overall experience and made an adjustment to our bill."}
{"text":"I was here a couple months ago with a group of people for a friend's bday, we didn't have a good experience. Our waitress seemed like she was stoned.... She kept on forgetting what we ordered and it took us over 45 minutes to pay the bill because she couldn't figure out how to divide up the bill. Also, the meat on my burger was like charcoal, burned AF. Wouldn't come back here again..."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I was 'fired up' to visit Fired Up, I had been walking the streets of Port Credit since the day that suspect pizza joint shut down and the first piece of reclaimed wood was hung outside (plus like, FIRE, so... my kinda place).  I was skeptical about paying them a visit as I noticed a lot of friends and family reviews (all 5 stars) within days of opening, only to see the true consumer experience begin to show over time. At the time of this review, Fired Up sits at a 1.5 star average with many of their reviews coming from reputable locals, that said most restaurants who succeed take feedback and make adjustments to improve and I was confident that this would be the case here.  If you haven't heard of Fired Up, it's a really neat concept, open fire kitchen, viewable from the street, and the menu consists of varieties of meat (both domestic and wild - as well as fish) done with big flavours. Looking at the wine list and the menu I would almost ascertain that they might be going for a sort of South American BBQ inspired restaurant. We arrived and despite the threat of poor weather we asked for a patio seat and were taken care of right away.  The drink menu is limited in my opinion. Despite the rest of Port Credit following the craft cocktail trend, Fired Up appears to stick to a mostly beer and wine beverage menu. My observation was the lack of diversity in their alcohol selection. There are very few beer options here and the limited wine options seem to all be from the same wineries depending what country you order from (ex: Argentina wines: 3-4 options, just all by the same winery). It just appears to not be carefully curated, more like an obvious stock selection provided by the distributor, a house somellier may help to address this lack of diversity. If your focus is going to be beer and wine you should do it well.  Looking through the menu it's a carnivore's dream, rib-eyes to ribs, venison, to chicken supreme, wild game chilli, jumbo prawns, octopus, squid and on and on! My fiancee doesn't eat red meat, but she'll kill shrimp any day and went with the jumbo prawns with a side caesar. I was so torn, mostly due to not eating all day, but after much-pained deliberation, I asked for a House salad to start followed by a half rack of ribs with the house macNcheese as my side. What diet?  The house salad was the first thing to arrive and it looked suspect from the moment it hit the table. Glistening too much and the lettuce looked limp. At first I thought that maybe they had put too much salad dressing on it, but then upon further inspection, many of the leaves were actually black and mushy as if they were expired. I brought this up to our server to which she said that they had this issue when they UNTHAWED THE LETTUCE. Frozen salad? What? That cannot be real. I pressed on in order to confirm this face and without skipping a beat she confirmed. The salad went back and they substituted a caesar salad for it with no questions asked, which was good.   My other note for this place was our server. With regards to overall attentiveness, she was hit or miss, often standing and chatting with other servers or taking long intervals between completing/remembering steps of service (topping up waters, taking orders, drinks, etc). In addition, this might be how they're trained her but we both found her to be very pushy on the appetizer and drink orders. We had just sat down and her first question was what appetizers we were having. Even throughout our meal we felt really pressured to buy and buy more. It wasn't a comfortable dining experience for the most part.  After 50/50 service and the salad incident, my experience was coloured pretty negatively at this point. That was until our mains came out. They totally redeemed themselves here! Our mains were massive in portion size and were beautifully plated. My ribs were incredibly tender and the sauce was delicious. The side of baked beans were also delicious and then the mac N Cheese! So creamy, and so many big flavours. I was truly impressed by this. My fiancee had ordered jumbo prawns, and while the server did not mention that they were spicy (my fiancee is very sensitive to spice, so a heads up either on menu or a mention by the staff might be something to warn people about) they were amazing, plump, and perfectly cooked. Both of these dishes are a must try in my opinion.  It's early days for Fired Up, I can see how and where others have reviewed them more harshly. There are some bright spots here but there are an equal number of growing pains for this new business that need to be addressed in order for them to become the 5 star restuarant they aspire to be.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I love the ambience Latin Music, Tracy the waitress she was  amanzing, food was good even though they  run out of mussel my husband love the place. Proseco pretty goo Santome my old address in the Dominican Republic"}
{"text":"I was keen on checking out this new spot on port credit. The setup and decor was quite impressive with all the limited space available.   I ordered atlantic slamom with fries on the side and garlic loaf for starter. My girlfriend got a vegan burger with mashed potatoes. Both the items were delicious and fresh to say the least.  They have decent selection for wines. I would definitely want to try this place again.   Cons : food took abt 20 mins to get to us on a not so busy night."}
{"text":"Kept going past this place and it was full at night. Had a day off so said, let's give it a try. They just opened for lunch during the summer I am told.   Shared a hamburger and jumbo (they are huge) shrimps. First the shrimps are a smokey flavour while still being juicy inside. I could have had another order if they were not so bit.   Then the hamburger. The angus burger had a nice fresh bun and the burger was fresh and juicy. I am not sure how you can say anything bad about it. We wanted truffle fries (willing to pay premium) but they wouldn't upgrade.   My only complaint if this is one, is that they are not accommodating. They do it their way which I respect. No truffle fry upgrade and they wouldn't cut the burger in the kitchen but they gave me a good sharp knife. I can live with this as long as the food stays epic.   The wine list is great as well. I just wish I wrote down the name of the glass I had."}
{"text":"Really a very poor experience. My girlfriend and I made a reservation (8:30; Saturday, June 18, 2016), and were seated promptly, so that was good. It was a little strange that the door they were using has you walk **behind** the bar to get to the Maître'D. They did warn us that they had only opened three days prior, and that the food might take long (it did), so I won't hold that against them.  They had an open kitchen concept, but clearly, the ventilation was lacking, because the entire restaurant was filled with wood smoke, which is a smell I usually enjoy, but this was making me feel a little sick--if you've ever had to spend a lot of time in front of a smoky BBQ, you'll know what I mean. Upon ordering a glass of wine, I was told they were out of ALL Chardonnays (c'mon guys... There's an LCBO right down the street), so I settled on the only white by the glass they had left, a fairly muddy Pinot Grigio.  We were informed after ordering drinks that they were out of most food, including all beef burgers (easily 1/4 of the menu). This is perfectly reasonable, if you're a new restaurant and you aren't sure how many covers you're going to do per night, but it's probably best to make sure you have extra beef if a quarter of your menu are burgers.  I ordered a tuna steak ($27, or right around there) and the girlfriend ordered a veggie burger. What arrived would make any proper chef ashamed of themselves. The tuna steak was a quarter inch thick, which meant it was mostly cooked instead of the rare they advertised--I have no idea why anyone would cut a tuna steak into slices this thin. It was grey and lacked seasoning of any sort--asking for salt resulted in a BOWL of salt with a spoon. However, the worst sin is that it was burnt from the grill, resulting in extremely bitter parts where the grill marks on the steak were, but I was hungry and it was edible. It came with some \"wild rice\", which was unfortunately inedible, as the rice was undercooked and hard.  My girlfriend's veggie burger crumbled apart almost immediately, as both the bun and the burger were dry. I can't personally comment on the quality, as I don't like them at the best of times and it wouldn't be fair for me to review it, but she is a vegetarian and knows her veggie burgers--apparently it was supposed to come with a sauce, but didn't. She said it wasn't very good.  However, the most egregious thing was the waitresses' and owner's (head manager, maybe?) response to learning about how our meals were--after all, as a new restaurant I thought they could use some honest feedback and they asked us. Our waitress was indignant upon learning that we didn't enjoy our meals very much, saying that \"the owner owns several very successful restaurants\" and \"most other people have been saying it's been good\". The owner said that \"they ran out of a bunch of the food including the seasonings, so that's why the food has no flavour\", which is BEYOND ludicrous: if you don't have the ingredients to cook a decent dish, then you shouldn't be offering it, and you *really* shouldn't be charging me almost $30 for it.  Now, I don't believe in asking for refunds or free things for a bad meal unless it's dangerously prepared food (eg. undercooked chicken), as there's no guarantee you're going to get good food when you order something. Nevertheless, I was glad to see that the owner-guy at least offered us some free gelato, which was genuinely pretty good. However, I think I would have offered a significant discount on the whole meal if I had been in his shoes, but again, he didn't have any obligation to do so, so I won't hold it against him.  There are better places to eat in this area than here, folks. The entire strip is full of restaurants. I may pop in in a few months for lunch to see if they've improved, but I certainly won't be taking any more dates there in the mean time."}
{"text":"I believe this restaurant is undeserving of a less-than 4star ranking.  FiredUp! is certainly worth not only a try, but a return visit in our busy schedules of competing leisure activities.    We enjoyed an excellent octopus and wild-game chili appetizer with a very tasty balsamic and hot sauce on the side.  Tracy was a pleasure as our server and is definitely an industry \"veteran\".  Great atmosphere and decor.    The drinks menu is worth exploring, with some wines and even a beer I've never encountered before, and I've tried many!  Don't let other's opinions become your own; give FiredUp! the decency of your patronage, as it deserves!  -Kevin Yun"}
{"text":"Laura was a great server, the food was incredible, & Tony made our night! Try the mussels, lamb, & ribs...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was going to give it two stars for the aesthetically pleasing patio, but it turns out there is absolutely no backup plan for outdoor diners when rain starts falling.   This means anyone sitting outside simply doesn't have anywhere to go if and when it rains...   The food, bad and overpriced. When those two things combine you're in for a bad ride. It took an hour to get our appetizer of garlic bread.  An hour.  Garlic bread.  This was unfortunately the culinary highlight of the evening.   Before we had gotten halfway through our starter, our meals suddenly showed up.   There's a reason people order starters, after all, and it isn't to have to make room on the table for their entrées and to decide which of the two to eat first.   If only the name of \"starter\"  included some hint within itself as to when it should be served...   On to the entrées, which were a bison burger, an ostrich burger and wild game chili, we noticed firstly that they were not very hot.  Lukewarm, at most.  The burger buns had soaked through and broke apart when picked up.  The chili was severely lacking in the \"wild game\"  element and we could discern maybe one piece of actual meat in the entire bowl.  The ostrich  burger, while labelled \"lean\"  by our waitress, was more aptly described as cardboard in terms of moisture and taste.  There were no toppings (save for a handful of mushy mushroom slices)  to add any sort of flavour to a bland patty, and while I am no expert on game meats and don't know if ostrich is simply tasteless, I would have enjoyed my burger itself having some elements of actual taste.  The bison burger was the best of the three dishes but that isn't saying much.  Dry meat, had some soggy fried onions and mushrooms on it and a slice of bacon.  When even bacon can't redeem a burger's taste, something is wrong.  I have no problem paying over twenty dollars for a burger when that burger offers something that a standard pub burger doesn't. In this restaurant's case, the offered extras were a bottle of ketchup, mustard and relish on the table.  Very posh.   Great setting, terrible everything else."}
{"text":"The higher rating is mostly for the service, which if anything was over attentive. Perhaps a bit because it wasn't busy on a tuesday night. But the food was not quite what I'd expect for the price point from a quality point of view. Servings were ample however. I had the poutine, the gravy didn't taste of anything, and for a straight up poutine it needs something to carry the concept. Burgers were large, juicy but not really easy to say that it was different from elsewhere. Would I go back? probably not."}
{"text":"The first real time I have debated 1 star, the only thing that changed my mind was the waitress. We were really excited about this place despite the poor reviews. Let's start from the beginning, when you walk up you are confused where the entrance is, and no one directs you. Finally go in through the patio and am squeezed in beside the kitchen, the bar and the walk way to the main dining area. I am standing there waiting to tell the hostess my name for the reservation and one of the staff members literally yells at me to move, no joke, he yelled MOVE!! I nearly had a heart attack thinking this is like a heads up situation, no no it is because where you wait to be seated is beside the cupboard that they keep the plates and he wanted to put them away. I couldn't even make this up. And yes it is hot, it was already like 35 outside and so you can imagine what it is like inside. That's not the issue though the real problem is the heat was making the exposed pipes perspire and was dripping a lot of water down onto unsuspecting patrons.  The food, for the first time in a long time I didn't finish my meal because I straight up thought it was bad. The veggie burger was not fresh as they claim, it was frozen and tasted freezer burnt. They automatically put it on a gluten free bun, which they should ask if you have a gluten sensitivity before serving that horrible, crumbly, greasy and COLD bun. I had to ask for a regular bun and let me tell you it was like the Wonder bread buns. Really step it up people, buns matter big time, it can or break a burger.  They told me they couldn't do the Mac balls without bacon, even thought the description says it is on top of bacon, not that bacon is in it. So I got it on the side because apparently they can make a veggie version of it but cannot make that one into the balls. It was mediocre anyways. The slaw was OK nothing special. Paid 5.00 for sparkling water so we didn't melt to death. My boyfriend had a regular meat burger and advised me to give no more then 2 stars for his as well. So disappointed, the waitress was super sweet and attentive though so the owner can thank his staff for saving him from my first 1 star. You think I'm being harsh but I always said I am saving my lowest review for when the food is inedible, and like I said I didn't finish because it was bad."}
{"text":"This incredible restaurant makes you think ant to come back for more and more! Order the meat platter and seafood platter! Nothing like it anywhere! Highly recommended! The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable"}
{"text":"When I first walked in it was all smoky and hard to see and breathe in the restaurant. it was almost like they had no ventilation on at all. We were standing waiting to be seated and a waitress took my friend by the shoulder and moved him out of the way without saying anything. Super rude.   The waitress took about 10-15 minutes at first to come up to us and she quickly left after taking our drink orders without asking us if we were ready to order. The drinks took a little longer to get them we thought and I had only ordered a Coke. The first Coke I got was flat so I told her about it and she brought me another one which was also flat, that happened with two more drinks before I finally gave up and ordered a water instead. It was served in a huge wine glass with more ice then water and to top it all off they left all of the pops on the small table and didn't take away anything for another 15 minutes.   My friend ordered a beer and that was all fine until he wanted another one and it took 15 minutes to receive that one as well.   We waited an hour for the food after we had ordered it and the side portions were small and it was all put on a small platter making it all hard to eat mixed with the small table because there is no room at all to move or to be comfortable.   For the price of the food, it is not worth it at all. My ribs were not flavourful what-so-ever and some of them were pretty dry. It is good meat but it tastes very bland, almost like there is no seasoning on them at all. My friend said the exact same about his burger. He said it was good meat but it was also very plain. He had to load it up with a bunch of different things simply because of the no flavour.   When the bill came the waitress had overcharged us for what we had been drinking so instead of $5 beers that we thought we were drinking. She was actually giving us $8 beers so that was another 10$ on the tab that we did not expect.   I will probably not be back at all until I hear better things about this place. It's sort of sad that it was all hype. For the price of everything, it's not worth it. My rack of ribs cost almost 35$ and I was not happy at all to pay that. You can go to a place like Montana's and get a better rack for a cheaper price and still have money left over to have a couple of beers.   If you are iffy on coming to Fired Up. I would save your money and time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The wait is long and food is mediocre. Mind you they do have a varied menu... My stuffed chicken was not cooked properly but they fixed that quick..But the chicken was kinda plain and the wild rice oily.. Waited at least an hr for our food.. My daughters chili was pretty spicy.. And it didn't even say that on the menu. Even my espresso took 15min and was cold!  You have to reserve is recommended..or if you don't, if u want to wait 1 hour for a seat.  Not sure I will be back.."}
{"text":"This joint is an absolute treat. My partner and I had the grilled octopus and bourbon burger - absolutely divine. I had originally wanted the grilled calamari but the server had said they were out of the calamari - clearly a resident favourite! It is slightly pricey but for the quality it was well worth the price in our opinion.   The staff were friendly, the service was quick and the selection of drinks are limited but very good. We walked right in at 9:30 and had seating immediately. Highly recommend !! Will definitely go back and try their other items on the menu,"}
{"text":"Had a great first experience at fired up. Server Timo went above and beyond. Food is great!!  Will definitely return !"}
{"text":"Pros Aesthetic appeal - patio , fire, decor, kitchen, music Location  Cons Wait staff inexperienced  Food tasted bland Took over an hour and a half to get our food Inattention to detail for food/drink preferences"}
{"text":"Great service and yummy steaks. The wine selection was good also. I'd come here for specifically the meat. The octopus had a nice kick as well."}
{"text":"Worst experience I had in a restaurant. First, the burger came little burnt. Secondly, the waiter was very rude, in the beginning he was rushing us while taking orders, and when we paid he was very unprofessional in his behaviour, and disrespectful, because our tips were low, he even asked about our backgrounds, and made sarcastic comments about it."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food.  So delicious.  We had the octopus to share and lamb burgers.  I'm blown away. And so much to  choose from. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"The ambiance is beautiful, but the SERVICE is terrible! The food waa good but the service was enough to make us not want to come back. I hope more focus is put on training their staff to be nicer to customers & be more organized so they don't have to keep running to other staff  when customers have a question"}
{"text":"It's not worth the wait.  We went last night for their soft opening.  I believe that's what they called it.  We lined up for about 45 minutes, which is not really a big deal for us.  What do you expect for a small place that's been awaited to open?  When we sat down, our food came at a decent time, but there was a couple who were seated on the patio and she told us they have been waiting for their food for 1.5 hrs!  And I mean she actually came to us, the people lining up, to tell us that fact. I believe there was another couple who waited just about the same.    After all that waiting, we finally got seated and I will say their atmosphere and decor is nice.  The patio is really pretty and apparently, to get that seating usually means a longer wait time.  Our server, Lauren, was amazing!  She was super friendly, great with suggestions.  I'd say she was the best part of our experience there.  We knew what we wanted by the time we sat, because we were afraid of longer wait time.  We ordered mac and cheese balls for appetizer, then bison and ostrich burger.  The mac and cheese balls were ok.  The dipping sauce was the best.  Like, if I'm only judging this, I'd give it a 5 star.  As we dug into our balls, I'm halfway through and I bit into an ice patch.  Ya, not a cold patch, ice.  ICE!  It's like a slushie mac and cheese inside.  It wasn't just me, my friend had the same experience.  We gave it back and we were given a new batch.  This time, they really deep fried it and even cracked each one open. That was better, but nothing extra ordinary.  Our burger came shortly and again, I was a bit disappointed.  The fries were soggy and the creamy coleslaw, I didn't enjoy it.  I usually like coleslaw, but this one, meh.  It wasn't even a lot.  It's on a little dipping sauce bowl and I still struggled to finish it.  My bison, I was not impressed.  It didn't taste seasoned.  It was this small meat that only filled half of my burger.  I mean, come on!  (check my posted picture and you'll see what I mean). They had mushrooms, but it was poured on one side, as if it was to compensate and a filler for the burger as a whole since the meat was only the size of half the bun.  Oh, I saw someone order the meat platter.  For $54, it didn't look impressive at all.    Overall, I think we over-hyped this place in our minds. I didn't want to say much about it, because it was my friend who was looking forward to it, even kept calling them to see if they're open already, but we both agreed that this was a flop adventure. I mean, I could live with the long wait, if the food was actually great. Waiting for food doesn't kill me, it's when the taste is bland... Or small... Or frozen for that matter... Then... No go."}
{"text":"While visiting Port Credit with my bridesmaids for shopping for the day we decided to stop in at Fired Up for lunch. I had no time to look up a place to eat and Fired Up was right across the street from where we were at, so there we went!  It looks pretty small when you walk in, but opens up a bit towards the back of the restaurant. The decor is interesting, with white animal heads on the wall and semi-fancy decor. I knew it was an Italian-ish type owner (I asked and yes one of the owners is Italian!)  I noticed quite a few negative reviews once I started looking around but I was optimistic! We ordered mac and cheese balls, a chicken salad, and a burger (all around the table). Honestly, every single meal was cooked perfectly, hot, and huge! All the food tasted so good and flavourful. Not a single complaint! The food also came out in good time.   Our waiter was super friendly and funny - he treated us really well and accommodated all our weird needs.requests. We also got a cheesecake for dessert and it was to-die-for! So full of flavour!   I really don't know why this place has so many bad reviews. We had a great experience and all the food we tried was great! I will definitely be returning next time I am in the area. The manager also came over to check on our table and chat with us a bit about the restaurant. I hope others have better experiences now-a-days!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. Not very busy, but it still took our waiter some time to take our order. It's a rustic bbq joint trying to dress up and be all fancy w/ tall stemmed wine glasses - kinda weird in my opinion.  My friend and I were hungry and ordered the meat platter for $75 - includes half rack of ribs, 2 pieces of chorizo, 2 pieces of Italian sausage, 2 pieces of beef   ribs, corn salsa, and potatoes slices. Comes out to be just under $100 for two people after tax and tip. Everything comes on a nice wooden plank. The ribs were the tastiest of all the meats. The ribs were not dry, fall off the bone, and their bbq sauce was really good. 2nd best would be the beef ribs (we dipped beef ribs into their rib bbq sauce which made it taste better). Chorizo was salty. Italian sausage was better than chorizo. Corn salsa was ok, no wow factor. Potato medallions were just fried slices of potatoe w skin on but it came w this tasty creamy dill dipping sauce. Asides from the ribs -  no wow factor in terms of flavour. I would just play it safe next time and get a rack of ribs to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"This restaurant shouldn't have opened, I went to this restaurant last summer and sat on the patio I was extremely excited to visit because had heard great things about them and always passed and saw their flames outside. The waitresses were nice and we did get seated on the patio at our request but the food was where things turned down hill. We started off with the Mac n cheese balls which were very large and delicious . We then moved onto the mains where I ordered the pasta which was an extreme salt bomb to the point where I wasn't able to eat it ! The waiter noticed I wasn't eating my food and offered me a box to which I told her it's extremely salty and she may as well throw it out she said to me that no one else has complained about it for the night and she took it and left with it to throw out. My friend had the Caesar salad and it was fine. We ordered two margaritas and before I could have a second sip of mine there was a huge fly in it! The waitress walked over and asked if we were good on drinks and I said you can throw mine out there's a huge fly in it and she said \"oh no\" and took it and threw it out. In the end I only enjoyed the Mac n cheese balls and the water from fired up and on my bill I paid $108 for the pasta two margaritas a Caesar salad and Mac n cheese balls and still went home hungry! If my review was not enough for you not to go one of my co workers went and had just as awful and experience and my banker recently told me about their bad experience there as well, all of them vowing to never return to such a joke of an over priced business"}
{"text":"This place was a bit more upscale feeling than I expected. Fancy waiters, and very hefty prices. We ordered the meat platter at the waiters recommendation. We asked how big it was and he said it \"Feeds 2 men, or 3 women.\" Not an intelligent thing to say. I know many women that can out eat me. So since we were 3 guys we ordered Calamari and Poutine ontop of the Chef special meat platter.  When the platter arrived it was easily enough for 4 people. Various pieces of meat on a bed of Potatoe wedges and vegetables. None of the cuts of meat were that great. I've had better, and I don't eat out at steak/meat places often.   On top of that our drinks were slow to be refilled and the coffee was meh.   Our bill was quite substantial and to be honest it didn't feel worth it. The service was good but that plus the \"meh\" food didn't cover the $$ cost.   Overall......meh. Not really worth it."}
{"text":"I think that for the most part people are being a tad harsh on this place. Is it stupid hot inside yes do they need to fix it yes immediately. However the owner is in the process of doing so, so let's talk about the atmosphere and design, I love the look of the place and they really treat you as part of the family there. Our server was great and she not only constantly came back to check on us but wanted to make sure we actually enjoyed the food.   Now the food is it the best in the city Burger wise probably not, I had the bison burger which was very greasy and did soak my bun, however the fast was great and on my burger scale I would rank it a 7/10. The Mac and Cheese balls were great as a starter, warm, crispy and full of cheesy goodness.   I would make a stop back here for sure and if you're looking for some where new to check out you should give it a try for sure.   I think most people expectations can never be met by any restaurant but I feel this one does its best for what they are trying to be."}
{"text":"To begin, no one greeted us at the door. Seemed like the waitresses were more intent on conversing with one another then getting us seated. The head hostess rolled her eyes at us when we asked to be seated on the patio. A very poor first impression.  After being seated, we noticed that the waitress always seemed rushed. Even quipping that it was a \"slow night\", we still went through 10-15 minute periods where we were not waited upon. We waited 20 minutes for the waitress to take our order and then another hour to receive our food.  The bison burger was a complete disappointment. It came dry and cold. Even the highly recommended \"Mac and cheese\" side came dry. Nothing seemed to be seasoned, not even black pepper or salt!  My friend's order of ostrich burger was no different. Again, dry, and bland. Neither of us could finish our meals.  The owner, however, was an exceedingly kind individual. You could tell that he cared about our experience. He offered us free drinks and comped our meals.  To end off our night, we find out that the waitress had mixed up the glass of wine with a more expensive glass. So what i thought was a $8 glass of wine became $10 (a small difference, but just another mistake).  Overall, i would give this place another try. But, i would hold off until they got their act together. If things don't shape up soon, im not sure how they could keep going."}
{"text":"Aesthetically this place is very good but the music was very loud, not allowing for good conversation amongst the group of 5 that we were.   The food looked good however the portions were slightly on the small side and we left hungry with holes burned in our pockets. Very expensive for somewhat ordinary food.   Our server Antonio could have done with improved interpersonal skills. He reminded us more of an old school Italian barber than a new age server, very blunt."}
{"text":"It was ok.... my boyfriend and I walked in with the expectation of this place being pretty outstanding based on the look and the location of the restaurant. I have to say if you are going to come here you might want to steer away from the portobello mushrooms unless you enjoy bitting into grown bitter mould, however that was only my opinion as there were other people around that ordered the same thing and seemed to enjoy it. I have to say I would probably give this place another chance as their mussels looked pretty good and the turkey burger my boyfriend ordered was quite tasty."}
{"text":"I agree with some other reviewers, the place is really cool.   Great decor and location , and while the food was ok, that is all you can say about it.   I had the chicken Cobb salad which I enjoyed, but it wasn't traditional (not saying that is a bad thing).   My husband had the chuck burger, which was ok.   High priced burger for the size .   The service however was great!    Very welcoming...... Might think about giving it another try one day."}
{"text":"Amazing ! Would definitely go back! My wife had the Gnocchi and I ordered the very succulent Rib eye. The Duck poutine was superb as well. Ambience is great. Ideal for a date night. The staff was friendly and so was the chef who made his way to our table and shared his views of his magical creations and what he has in store in the coming weeks"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a few girlfriends. We all ordered different burgers and everyone enjoyed their meal.   The place is rustic and interesting. Nice seating and the wooden plate boards are a nice touch.  I had the Wild Boar burger on a (substituted) gluten free bun. It was delicious! Bun was crumbly but that's a little to be expected due to lack of gluten. Lovely sauce on that one too. Food took about 45 minutes to arrive, and one of the burgers arrived 15 minutes later than that too so timing was a little off. Kinda awkward.   Server was delightful and attentive. No complaints.   Place is VERY smokey inside. It didn't bother me that much but a couple of the gals at my table weren't too fond of it. You'll definitely stink after!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I gave a restaurant, especially a highly anticipated new hotspot, this low of a rating. And even though I waited (you know to cool down and reflect) I still can't seem to avoid my disappointment at Fired Up!  When I read bad reviews about a place I usually look at how many reviews the reviewer has posted. If I see one or two, then I know they just had a bad experience and wanted to tell the world. If I see 50 or more reviews, then I assume that the reviewer has been to a few places and is probably a better judge of a place.   I read a lot of bad reviews about Fired Up!including an unbearable amount of heat and smoke inside, bad service and bad food. And in order to fare better than some of the early adopters, I waited a few weeks to give them a chance to work out the kinks. Now I can accurately report that the \"kinks\" have not been worked out. However, much of the problem really falls under Service 101.   We got lucky and were allowed to sit at a nice table for two on the patio. I was happy since it was a beautiful night out and sitting outside eliminated the remarks about unbearable heat inside (It is also very loud inside) Unfortunately that was as good as it got.   We ordered a simple meal including a full rack of ribs, a house poutine and a couple of sides. We were enjoying the outdoor breeze and chillin while waiting for the food. Close to 35 minutes later, the table beside us had ordered, got their meal and were paying. We had not received anything yet. When I asked the waitress she said \"it's the ribs, they take 30-45 minutes. Sorry\".   OK Service 101 goes like this....\" Hi, welcome to Fired Up! Is this your first time here? I just wanted to mention that the ribs are taking 30-45 minutes tonight\". To which we would have replied, \"OK, can we get an appetizer while we wait?\" More money for the restaurant and a more tolerable customer because they're not starving.   Instead, we placed the order, were told nothing and after 35 minutes and \"hey, where's our meal? We're famished\", we got some bread. The ribs came out after 45 minutes. They were dry and luke warm. Really? Yes, really.   After attacking the ribs, I realized we had not received our house poutine. That took and hour to come out. And after complaining about that, one of the owners came over, said that he agreed with me (that the customer engagement was horrible) and offered to cover the poutine.   It seems that if you want to be successful in Port Credit, all you need to do is score a location with a patio. That alone will fill your restaurant. Forget service and forget good food. It took many years for Snug Harbour to be less \"smug\" and at this rate it will take Fired Up! forever. But in the meantime, if you want to be part of a hip crowd you gotta go there.   If you really have to go, I would recommend the following:  A) get a seat on the patio, if weather permits.  B) Ask what appetizer you can get quickly C) stay away from the ribs  When you're sitting on a patio on a beautiful evening, with drinks, there's not much that can go wrong.  However Fired Up! managed to find a way. They also offered me a free salad, desert or side on my next visit. That was quite presumptuous. The only resolution that would have me coming back was for the owner to simply comp the meal.   There are many better places to spend an evening than at Fired Up!  However due to all the hype, you just have to learn first hand."}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood, and thought that after about a year, it was time to try our this place.  We choose a seat inside, it is nicely decorated, the staff is attentive and the drinks were quick and delicious.  I ordered an old fashioned, it was what I expected.  I had a burger and my fiance had the salad with chicken.  The whole meal was okay, there was nothing stand-out.  The burger was cooked medium, which I like, but I thought it was funny I wasn't asked about it.  the meat was ground/minced a little too much, so it had a texture like the store-bought pre-made paddies.  It tasted good.  The fries were double-fried or at least fried dark, which is something that you (the royal you) want, and the ketchup came in a single serve glass jar - the only real sign of fine dining (other than the price).  I may or may not go back to Fired Up, if I do, I wouldn't order the burger again."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere was good. We got our food on time. I ordered seafood ceviche salad. It was just really bad. It tasted bad, very \"vinegarry\" and had an off smell. It felt like something that should have been in a sandwich but wasn't.  I couldn't finish it. I then ordered fries because I was still hungry and the fries came out undercooked. No one at my table could finish their food. They need a better menu."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this restaurant. My husband and I both had a bison burger and we were both disappointed. The apple slaw on the burger made the bun soggy and the cheese does not have a strong enough taste for the burger. The Mac and cheese lacked enough cheese and the coleslaw was bitter and lacked dressing. The only thing we ate that we liked was the bacon. There are some good things about this restaurant but none of them are related to the food. The service was good and the patio is very inviting. They have a great patio to enjoy this great summer weather but do not order food here!"}
{"text":"I very much wanted to like fired up. It is an imaginative space, very much not a cookie cutter resto.  On a such stifling day I can't understand why the doors and some windows remained wide open? The house flies were certainly happy to come inside to the relative cool (we were constantly shooing them away). The service was friendly but the food just didn't match our expectations and I would suggest you will be much happier for less just a few doors away."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first experience at Fired Up, we had the mac n cheese balls, bison burger w coleslaw, and chili.  I really enjoyed my burger, I like them more dry than juicy, so it worked for me, and the toppings went really well to give it a smokey taste.  My sister enjoyed her chilli, calling it \"the perfect chilli taste\".  I would try a different side and appetizer next time. The atmosphere is loud and comforting, so feel free to bring everyone you know and have a great dinner out!  Rocco (the owner) is great and will come around sometime throughout the night to find out how things are going :)  note: though there's heat lamps, the patio is windy and chilly, especially going in to fall!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second chance despite our disappointing first impressions. Boy, are we glad we did. The menu seems to have been entirely revamped and the restaurant has come a long way albeit in a short while. I had the lamb and my friend had the ribs. They were done exactly how we wanted it and the portions were very generous. Service, like our previous visit, was very friendly and quick. The prices are a bit overpriced. Nonetheless, we'll probably be making it back again."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! The food, the staff, the atmosphere were all amazing! We got the meat platter and it was delicious and a great portion for the both of us. Lots of flavour and the meat was all cooked to perfection! My first time at fired up and definitely not my last time!"}
{"text":"My expectation for this place was pretty high from the reviews I read and the hyped comments from people who had tried this restaurant before. The interior of the restaurant is very nice; they had an outdoor sitting area with \"fire\" from the poles making it a very decorative restaurant. The place was small and condensed but there was enough room in-between tables.   As for the food, I found it very bland. My bill came out to be around $65 for 2 people, ordering 2 bourbon burgers with fries and the mac and cheese balls. The mac and cheese balls did not have much of a cheese taste whatsoever; the dipping sauce was what gave it flavor. As for the burger, it was just a regular burger. Not to mention, it was a little bit burnt.   I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend. I would not revisit this restaurant as I believe it is over priced for the food. Although the atmosphere is pleasant, the food wasn't up to the expectation."}
{"text":"Came to try the place out on a whim. I see there are only a couple of reviews so I'll preface by saying this review only included two menu items and some drinks but I'll speak to the ambience, service, and other particulars.  A number of things would suggest this place should do well. Having said that despite the desirable port credit location a number of restaurants on the south side of lakeshore in that part of port credit have struggled historically.  This restaurants boasts a prime location, outdoor patio with ample seating, and is surrounded by a number of restaurants and established port credit eateries.   We were greeted by a friendly accommodating staff upon walking in on a Friday afternoon at around 5pm. Patio was beginning to fill up but plenty of seating remained inside. We were promptly shown to a table outside and presented with a choice of sparkling or regular water. Our server was quite busy but prompt, attentive, and pleasant to interact with. Incidentally we noticed no shortage of wait staff which bodes well for busier periods. The inside was clean, freshly renovated, and well lit.   We started with the corn bread. A bit surprisingly this was served cold. Interestingly it was not overly sweetened which I thought was a courageous move on the restaurants part. After the first bite of a room temperature, unsweetened piece of corn bread I feared I would not be particularly enamoured by it but the texture and more authentic (read: not overly sweetened) flavour grew on me. Absolutely nothing memorable about it but passable I suppose. Unshaken, I eagerly awaited what promised to be a delicious lamb burger.  The lamb burger arrived accompanied by a small portion of coleslaw and at my request a salad instead of fries. Presentation was appropriate and looked quite appetizing. The slaw and the side salad were on the better side of average and I had no complaints about them.  Sadly, the lamb burger itself failed to meet expectations. The meat was dry, and a touch overcooked. The bun and other toppings were flavourful and fresh, but the burger itself is not something I'd see myself ordering again. A great lamb burger should be juicy, flavourful, and seasoned just enough to complement the natural flavour, aroma and texture of the meat.   Despite what I've somewhat belaboured above, I'm inclined to give this place another go. There was a meat platter that several people ordered that looked and smelled great, as well as some interesting menu options including crawfish, swordfish, and some other unique choices.   Choices of bison burger, ground beef burger, angus burger, and lamb burger as well as a build your own burger seemed quite inviting to a burger afficionado, but after today's experience I'm doubtful I'll go the burger route again.   The take home: great location, friendly staff, nice outdoor patio, and a menu that if executed properly will offer a unique and interesting dining experience. Nonplussed with the actual food however and I suspect this will be the key to their longevity or lack thereof.  Will be posting an updated review after my second go around. Two and a half stars (but bumped to three due to friendly service and great location and pleasant ambience)"}
{"text":"Came here for our first time last night. We were able to make a reservation and the staff were friendly. The decor and atmophere was nice and we loled that we could watch the Rapters game while we waited for our food.   We ordered the mac & cheese balls as an app and shared it. They were really good for a starter and there were 3 of us so we all got 1 to eat. We ordered the venison, ribs & the whole fish. The venison was cooked perfectly! It was so tender and soft. The whole fish was soo soft and not over salty. My ribs were good and tasty but not the best ribs ive ever had. Also, my fries were lile burnt to a crisp... but it came with chili & corn. The meals are very good portions but are high in price. I ended up paying $50 for my full rack of ribs, my share of mc&cheese balls and a beer.  Overal we were very pleased with our experience and would recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Went for the inaugural brunch on Labour Day Monday!  Food was very good.  Reservations not needed.  There were 3 sections. First section- hot plate foods of French toast, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage, salmon in a butter dill sauce, chicken in a mushroom sauce, pasta, various salads.  I prefer my sausages very well done and bacon very crispy, but theirs was tasty and not greasy.  Second section- beef carvery with roasties and veg, garlic shrimp.  Beef was rare and melt-in-your- mouth tender, and shrimp delicious!!  Third section was breads, fresh fruit and sweets with eclairs, strawberry and Portuguese custard tarts.  A great way to end a meal.   Service from Scott was excellent!"}
{"text":"The place was nicer than I was expecting, but it is kinda small.  The menu is a bit pricey I paid around $45 for my steak.  With 2 pints, tax and tip my total was around $85.  I feel you could get better bang for your buck sonewhere else.  Server was nice enough, but as mentioned elsewhere a bit douchey lol.  Got the bills mixed up between 2 people in my party and asked that one guy give the other 10 bucks instead of having to fix it."}
{"text":"Fired Up has great curb appeal. It is exciting to find a place that looks like you will love everything on the menu. However, it all ends there. The servers are a welcoming crew and do their best but at times seem confused or just used to the food not impressing. They do not give any helpful notes and I was served and organic beer when I requested gluten free beer.   I gave the restaurant two visits to conclude I will not return unless just grabbing their truffle fries and wine in the patio. The fries were a nice change with the truffle oil I will give them that. The cob salad was served on a long narrow plate with each ingredient lined up. It was impossible to mix and enjoy the mingling flavours. The ribs were barely hot and had BBQ sauce brushed on to make them look appetizing but it was actually gross. I prefer it cooked with the ribs and sizzling along with them. They tasted dry and oddly not cooked enough so the meat would fall off the bone. Anyway, a huge disappointment for a BBQ joint. Don't bother.   I can only hope the owners rethink their kitchen staff and find someone who can rock some ribs on their stupendous grill facing the sidewalk. Please Fired Up, hear my plea and become the food that you look like you serve."}
{"text":"My husband and I are very impressed with their lamp burger, it flavor was brought out by the ingredients. It is very refreshing to have a such unique burger on the menu. The atmosphere was very relaxing and fun. The waitress were very friendly and nice. One little thing I think can be better is the kale in their house salad. It is a bit hard to digest. Overall I think it's price and it's quality totally match up!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow.. Server didn't write our orders down, and came back and asked again and it still came out wrong.  Got the soft shell crab salad, the crab was good, the salad was just some leaves drenched with olive oil on it with a few grape tomatoes.  My husband got the Ribeye steak which said it came with cornbread and he chose coleslaw as his side.  It came out with fries and no cornbread.  I asked the server for the cornbread and he brought put a few slices of baguette with olive oil on it.  When I said I thought it came with cornbread he just said we don't have cornbread.  Steak was OK but not worth the $42 price.  We ordered Jameson on the rocks, the server said they don't carry it and offered scotch instead which was $24 when we got the bill.  The other members of our party ordered the burger which was just OK, the veggie burger was dry and bland, the meat platter which had good lamb but the sausage was dry and the ribs were not good.  The truffle fries tasted like feet.  It was also quite hot and smokey in the restaurant and it took forever to get the bill.  Better choices out there.  Oh yeah, as we were walking out unimpressed, the owner said he would give us a \"free appetizer\" coupon for next time to make up for it.. when we were not interested, he screamed that we were rude.. in front of all his customers.."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant experience at this restaurant, despite negative reviews.  Our server Keith was great, very attentive and professional. We ordered the ceviche & seafood platter. The ceviche was decent, but not your authentic ceviche. The seafood platter was great and very filling for 2 people. Great presentation!"}
{"text":"A nice little place on lakeshore Even though a limited menu selection but definitely a good one. The food was pretty good. I ordered the lam chops. Only suggestion that they should come with a sauce. I had to ask for a sauce separately. It was weird that they didn't serve any bread at the table. We had to ask for it. Then they didn't serve any butter with the bread, we had to ask for it. Every time the drinks would be requested, it took quite a bit of time before the server brought them over. It lacked in service quality.  Wouldn't mind going there again only if they offer better and quicker service"}
