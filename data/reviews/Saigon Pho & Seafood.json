{"text":"Large portions, quick & friendly service, and clean bathrooms. The egg rolls are amazing and the prices are great too. This is only the 2nd time we have had pho and it was really good!"}
{"text":"Saigon Pho is Amazing.  My favorite dishes are the summer rolls, and the rice noodles and seafood (I think #2 and #41) My husband loves eating the beef salad.   

Everything about this places is great.  It's one of those places where the food is better than the ambiance, but let me tell you, your stomach will NOT care! 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"So good! So, so good. I've liked everything I've had, especially #23 -- fried tofu with rice noodles. One note -- if you eat in and you value good-tasting water, avoid theirs; it's just plain GROSS."}
{"text":"Do you remember those 90's shows where the gang goes to the coffee shop every episode?  I swear if this place were by my house I would be at it all the time, I would never eat at home.  I'd even go by myself...  I don't need no friends, Jerry.  This place never, ever disappoints. I have been here 40 times+ with spouse and others and is wonderful for comfort Asian food.  

Eat: The house fried rice is wicked, the fried chicken is lovely, you just can't go wrong here. Great for shrimp, crab and lobster and very nice fish dishes.  All the food here is beautiful, don't just go for Pho: try something different, you'll love it!

Don't Eat: -----  One time the fried octopus was not as good as I remember.  Once...

 This is the REAL Saigon Pho.  Friendly service, fast and affordable.  Keep up the trifecta.  Thank you, Saigon Pho!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here a few times, and always had the Pho. Good food, good service. Plan to try out the other entrees some time. My go-to place for Vietnamese food in Chandler."}
{"text":"Since our first visit almost 14 years ago this has been our favorite location for Pho in Arizona.  My wife and I frequently had Pho when we were dating in the Bay Area and were delighted to find a fantastic restaurant out here in AZ.  My son has some pretty severe food allergies and Lauren and the rest of the staff do a wonderful job of ensuring that his soup is always how he needs it to be. Due to his allergies, this is one of the few restaurants we can eat out at without bringing food from home.  My current favorite is the BBQ Pork With Shrimp over Rice while my wife loves the #22 Curry Chicken Soup.

The restaurant is even better since the remodel and the staff has always been courteous and kind.  Also, try the #1 Egg roll, they are crisp and delicious and finish up the meal with the Iced Coffee."}
{"text":"Don't come here for Pho! It's not authentic and it's Chinese style trust me!!! But they do have good crispy fried chicken. This place is not a good authentic Vietnamese restaurant but it's an authentic Chinese restaurant. Try phu Thanh instead in mesa!! If u want good Vietnamese food"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Awesome food every time and great prices. Looks pretty divey but its fantastic. It is what it is. Will be back many times"}
{"text":"Great old standby for those of you who are looking for a taste of Vietnam at a great price point.  No frills, no fou-fou, little ambiance.  Just good solid flavor for super cheap.  We eat here just about every Sunday.
The Pho is very good, but I would not say its the best the valley has to offer.   There are other places, but they are usually more expensive.  Where they really stand out are with their other noodle soup dishes.  The #19 Won-ton Noodle Soup and #20 Spicy Clear Noodle Seafood.  For years, the #20 was only obtainable as an off-the-menu special.  You had to know about it to order it.  Due to demand, they put it on the menu for all to enjoy.  There is the curry noodle soup and the spicy noodle soup which are both excellent as well.  
If you are not into soup, the menu is expansive with options that leave Vietnam altogether (terriyaki, chow fun, etc.).  Their green beans and pork are great (look on the back of the menu).  Even though I haven't tried the house chicken (I'm too hung up on the #20), it looks fantastic.  As does the wok fried crab, steamed clams and whole steamed or fried fish.  Most seafood is fresh from the tank and sold by the pound.
Starters are good.  The #1 - Egg Roll and #2 Spring Roll hit the mark each time.

Great flavorful and consistent place that will never hurt your budget.  
Highly recommended.

11/09/08 - Downgraded due to cleanliness..... while the food still is very, very good, I have noticed a steep decline in cleanliness."}
{"text":"This is a staple in local eateries.  We love the spring rolls and you can't beat the service here.  You'll never have an empty water or have to wait long for your food.  I tried multiple crab dishes here as well for dinner and they were delicious."}
{"text":"I use to like coming to this place, it was by far my favorite place to eat Pho. But the last time I went, last Sunday, I didn't care for it that much.
We were seated in a corner booth next to the door on the other side, servers rushed us to order, after ordering another two severs tried rushing us to order again!?! 

Food was brought out pretty quick, a lot of noodles, but where did all my meat go for my combination pho?!! I asked for a little side dish to put my sauce in, never came. My drink was refilled once, it took forever to get my check, and all of a sudden where did my server(s) go? 

I just felt super rushed, then when I was ready to go, no one was there..."}
{"text":"In my exploration of phoenix Vietnamese restaurants, there seem to be many types of pho and pho restaurants. Some delicate, some hearty, some traditional, and some that are not really classifiable in a good way. 

The broths I've experienced here are more hearty and filling. You get a good amount of nice, tasty broth, fillings (veggies and meats), and the perfect amount of noodles whether you're dining in or getting take out.  

The food has always been fresh here and the service always has been fast and friendly. The price is also amazing for the quality and quantity you get. There's really no comparison from all the pho places i've been in town.

For Pho, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"So every time I'm craving some pho I always come back here. 90% of the time I go by myself. It's easier than trying to convince someone else to go with me. 

The pho is always delicious and the service is always quick! I sometimes wonder if the servers understand what I'm saying, but I'm glad the numbering system is implemented here, \"#10 Please. Thank you.\" I should try to learn some Vietnamese basics since that's my number one place to go."}
{"text":"After being there three time I guess I could give it 4 stars.  Their food were good. Prices were cheaper than other places that I have been . Service was fast as fast food.  Plenty of waitresses to wait on you on weekday. But on the weekend they may forget that  you are there."}
{"text":"Mmmm, salt 'n pepper squid - crispy delicate spicy goodness paired with a bowl of delicious Pho. No, I'm not dreaming...I had dinner at Saigon Pho last night! I love this place. The menu is so elaborate making it difficult to make a decision. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach but who doesn't like leftovers the next day. Okay, so maybe Pho isn't so good the next day. 

This restaurant is a must try! I've been coming here for over a year and it's always busy. Service is good and best of all the price is right - CHEAP! Try the Beef Chow Fun, fresh Spring Rolls or the Salt 'n Pepper Squid. Actually, why not try them all. This is a great place to come with a group who is open to trying new delights.

I can't wait to go back. I'm thinking I might have to stop by for some takeout next week!"}
{"text":"I was spoiled living on top of Vietnam 2 in the heart of the TL in San Francisco, and I never thought I would ever find another Pho joint in all of the world that I could love more, but I have, and it's a short 5 minute drive from my home in Chandler Az. I can literally eat pho for breakfast lunch and dinner, but for the sake of my sanity, I try and mix it up a bit. As soon as I step foot into this place I feel like I'm right back home. Everything about it reminds me of my fave spot in SF minus the small fish pond near the front entrance. I also love the consistency of the dishes here, always satisfying, never disappointing. And their fried egg rolls are pretty bomb too! I think I'm going to go have myself some now! YUM!"}
{"text":"I understand that they can get busy, BUT  as a regular, I'm disappointed.  Service was soooooo slow.  Food came out cold...Seriously!  Pho is supposed to be piping hot.  Also, the outside of the spring rolls were dry.  Yuck!  In addition, the Pho broth was too salty.  TOO MUCH MSG!!!  It's usually not this bad, but this time was horrible."}
{"text":"My first time trying out this restaurant and would prefer this considering it being a reasonable price as well. The food came out quickly after ordering the Bun Bo Hue pho. This version of it was less Spicy then it originally is."}
{"text":"We went there on Friday dinner time. As usual as the other places, this place was busy. The customer service was phenomenal. We ordered spring rolls first. Yummy!! you can enjoy this tasty dish three different ways; hot sauce, sweet peanut sauce and Asian sweet sauce. 
We always get Pho as the title indicates, but this time, we got Beef and Basil Chow Fu noodle and stir fried vegetable tofu over rice. There were delicious. We had no regret ordering from the individual dish. Although we only got two dishes, we were satisfied with the quality. We would order those individual dish in the future as well."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years.   Everything we've tried is delicious. Food is consistent, quick and inexpensive.  The Salt and Pepper Squid, Black Pepper Lobster, and of course the pho is always good."}
{"text":"Update: Remember the friend thand had eaten the food with a fly? Well, today his wife just told me he has been going to the bathroom all day. I think he got food poison? They're going to be reported to the Department of Health, Chandler City, and BBB.

--------

We always eat here when we crave Saigon Pho. Today was the last we eat here. Here's why .

We ate with 2 other families. One of the families got their order wrong. Instead of apologizing,  the server kept pointing at the menu telling them that they got what they ordered. Then, my friend found a dead fly in his food. Disappointed friend talked to another  server about it. You know what the server said instead of simply apologizing?  She said \"you sit by the door so the fly must have gotten in and on your food.\" My friend's wife said that the fly was already under the food.  Server replied, \"no, no, no, no!\" She should have just apoligized so they could have moved on. They even had the audacity to charge them for the plate with the dead fly. My friends paid for it anyways. I could tell that they were trying to get rid of us. The other server gave our check even though we were still eating. He kept coming back for it thinking I would put my card on the bill. Later,  I see a server putting a shaved ice desert on our table. We didn't accept it. My friend said the damage has been done. All they needed was an apology,  but instead, the rude server kept on with her attitude.  Finally, the couple asked for the number of their manager. Rude server was upset. These people need to learn about customer service and ethics. I never make reviews.  When I do, it's  something everyone has to know about."}
{"text":"You can't beat this place. Excellent food, fast service and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"please note that they are CLOSED  for summber break until  7/15 2016. otherwise this meal would be good and reasonably priced as usual"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by friends for their pho.  Its good and cheap.  The soup broth is tasty and not loaded with MSG.  I've had their rice noodle dishes and those are filling and tasty if not particularly gourmet.  I love their ice coffe served in the traditional style of it slowly dripping through and into a glass with condensed milk.  
The food is good and tasty and cheap.  I've had better tasting and cheaper in San Diego but we're in Arizona and I'd rather not schlepp 6 hours just for a meal."}
{"text":"Fast service, delicious food and excellent prices. 

We've been eating at Saigon for about eight years, and highly recommend it if you enjoy Vietnamese food. 

The service is very prompt. Our food usually comes within minutes of ordering and it's delicious. The waitresses are friendly. And lunch for two is usually around $15. 

Newbie advice: 

It's very busy during the lunch rush hour, so get there early. 

The decor isn't the finest, but it's the food you'll be eating! 

Fish sauce may not smell great, but it's so so tasty. 

Not a big Pho (pronounced fawh) fan? Try the char-grilled shrimp and beef over rice, stir fried white onion noodle with chicken or lemon grass chicken over rice (spicy). The Vietnamese spring rolls are also delicious."}
{"text":"good pho but very unattentive service.  took them 15 minutes to take our order.  after they took out order, the food came out pretty late and it took them even longer to get our check.  lose 2 stars not because of taste but service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!
Good affordable Pho.  I can't really try anything else due to a fish allergy, but the PHO is awesome. 
The broth is light but super flavorful. The meat is tasty, and the sides are just right.

 4 stars because my allergy fear keeps me from being able to try anything else."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, inexpensive, delicious Pho. Love the egg rolls, spring rolls, and beef pho!"}
{"text":"We ordered grilled beef and shrimp combo and Chinese broccoli. We liked them. They are delicious and healthy. I will try other meals next time."}
{"text":"One less star for every piece of hair I found in my bowl of fake Bun Bo Hue.   Found a total of 5 but yelp requires me to rate at least one star. Besides the HAIRS, the broth was greasy, and unflavored.  Every ingredients I tried to add to make it taste better  was useless....USELESS!!!  They took it back and gave me a new one and still made me pay for the meal of hair that I had to eat!"}
{"text":"BEST VIETNAMESE IN ALL OF ARIZONA!!!!!! The staff is super friendly and the service is fast. Don't forget to get the resh Coconut....."}
{"text":"Fast service, good quality food with affordable price, friendly staff, no complain.   Bravo!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this place.  The food was out standing (had the eggrolls and #14), the service was super quick, the portions were big and the price was perfect.  The place was clean and the atmosphere was great.  I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This place has been here for a long time, and for good reason. It's great! The food is delicious, the portion sizes are big, the price is cheap, and the food comes out fast. It seems to always have customers no matter what time you go. 

Crispy spring rolls, and soft spring rolls are some of the freshest and best I've had. The pho broth is not greasy and packed with great, authentic flavor. Not watered down, like some other places. I'm not as big on the combination rice dishes, but love everything else."}
{"text":"I didn't love this place... I often go to UnPHOgettable in Mesa - I think I was comparing it too much. I went with a large group (6-8 ppl), we didn't have to wait too long, but were sat in the back by some hallway or something - the table was sticky - it was just off. 

I ordered the beef pho, it was just good. The beef was tough and didn't taste fresh. We also shared fried rice and spring rolls. The fried rice was a little bit too greasy for my taste.

I recommend UnPHOgettable in Mesa - it is way better!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant.  Soup, noodle,  and rice dishes are all excellent.  Spring rolls excellent.  Service was great even when the restaurant was packed."}
{"text":"We went here after purchasing a groupon.  The service was so strange.  I ordered veggie pho and substituted the noodles for extra vegetables.  My boyfriend ordered pho Thai.  When our food came out (brought out by a cook, i believe) it came with two sides of the normal pho-fixings (bean sprouts, mint, etc etc).  Well the woman, who I pesume is one of the owners and happened to be our server, quickly came over and took my plate away... Not sure why.... We didn't get refills on our drinks the whole time we were there either.  The woman just sat on her computer (right next to us).  So strange.  My pho was really bad, too. But veggie pho is a hit or miss.... The biggest disappointment was the service."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years.  I've never been disappointed which is rare since I'm extremely picky.  The number 50 is great, and so is the rice and chicken soup.  My boyfriend gets a rice noodle bowl with pork and egg rolls on top.  He must really like it because he's gotten it every time we visit for years.  If you like Vietnamese food you have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Saigon Pho for years, since probably when we moved here back in 2000 or 2001 .The servers are super friendly, and remember you ,( or at least it seems that way ), the menu is fantastic. The only problem is that I don't get to try other items on the menu, since everytime I want to get my favorite. My son has been coming here since he was about 4 or so years old and is a fan also. Service is fast and friendly. If you want Vietnamese food, and don't care about decor, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Amazing Pho, spring rolls, and Thai iced tea!! The place doesnt look so great from the outside, but its great food and service for a good price."}
{"text":"Looking for a good vietnamese fast food restaurant, 
I tried the BBQ pork and the flavor was ok. 
Definitely not worth coming here 
This is the worst experience I've ever had anywhere.  
Was here before for dinner and it was uneventful.
Once very satisfied customer is no longer their customer. 
If you want real good vietnamese foods and restaurant services, go somewhere else. 
I guess I will never know how good their foods now. 
Don't even want to try.
On a positive note, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This yummy Vietnamese spot never disappoints!  It's fresh and delicious.

I've been here many times with family and friends (who are Vietnamese food experts) and they love it!  

My boyfriend always gets the charbroiled pork and egg rolls over noodles (#24) and there is never anything left on his plate.

I'm a bit more adventurous and try lots of different things.  The Pho is great and comes in a huge serving!  

Yesterday I tried #37 (chinese sausage and shrimp fried rice).  Delicious.  The chinese sausage gave the dish a nice salty sweetness and the shrimp were big and plump.  The rice was cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of stickiness to it.

Another great dish is the salt and pepper shrimp.  The flavoring is fantastic and the shrimp are crispy and succulent.  

One of the best things about this place is the pricing!!  Dishes range from $5.95 to $6.50 with seafood running a bit more.  

It is a hole in the wall kinda joint.  Do not go here if you are expecting high class furnishings and impeccable service.  The staff do their job and are nice and fast.  But it's not a high-society affair.  Food comes out fast and piping hot!"}
{"text":"I have been to pho saigon several times and have taken out few times.
their food is always consistent, quick and good.
anytime we are in the mood, we always go there."}
{"text":"Place was ok.. Ambiance was decent, tacky booths. Got #12 beef pho large. Nice portion size. The broth I was not a fan of, it had a very smoky taste to it. Also plastic chopsticks are never fun, but they did provide me with wood ones upon request. Recommend this place if you need a quick pho fix and quality doesn't matter. Service was excellent though!"}
{"text":"Best Bun Bo Hue (Hue style, spicy beef noodle soup) I've ever had at any restaurant I've been to! It almost compares to my mom's...almost.

They Americanize it some, in the sense that they leave out the chocolate meat and pig feet (Boo to that!), but the broth is so delicious it doesn't even matter! It's all about the BROTH! I was sooo tempted to take it home in a friggin cup b/c I was overly stuffed. Yes, it was THAT good.

I'm guessing if the bun bo hue is this good, the pho is probably tha bombeezy!"}
{"text":"Really Good Vietnamese food! Good Service. I always order the same. Pho Soup, egg noddle, seafood style."}
{"text":"This place serves huge portions at decent prices, but that's the best thing I can say about it. The environment is so bland that it reminded me of working in an Intel cubicle farm. The service was pretty bad, I had to walk up front and interrupt the flirtations of the servers to get a container to take my leftover pho home. The food was good, but certainly nothing to rave about. If you need some quick vietnamese and can completely ignore your surroundings, this place could be acceptable, but otherwise I'd avoid it."}
{"text":"My go to favorite.  Get the crispy noodles with chicken.  You really cannot go wrong.  Simple atmosphere very clean...the food and employees make this what dining should be."}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices for excellent, largely portioned food! Favorite pho place by far."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years now. I love the spring rolls and the grilled pork. Service is always fast and friendly. If you visit this place give their ice coffee a try, it is really good."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night for dinner and the place was very busy which is always a good sign.  I was there with my wife and we were waiting on my sister.  We decided to order before she got there.  Asked one of the servers to take my order but he stated that he wasn't allowed to and that he would tell one of the waitresses to come over.  Waited for another 15 min until she came and took our order.  My sister came about 1 min later and put her order in after waiting 10 min.  To my surprise her food came out before mine.  I had to wait another 10 min until I got my food.  Unacceptable.  One thing that they can do to avoid all of this is to hire more help or to allow the bus boys/water boys to take the orders during busy hours.  The food was decent but the customer service was awful."}
{"text":"Pho first timer here and it was great. Large portion. Hit the spot on a rainy day."}
{"text":"Saigon Pho doesn't have a fancy sign, great decor or even windows you can look in/out of. But who cares when you have the most amazing Pho in the valley (and at the best prices)? The servings are very big and everything averages about $6 a plate. Staff is very attentive and quick to deliver the goods.

As you can read through the various other reviews - everyone has a favorite dish. I have a problem with gluttony so I can't suggest a single dish - I can only suggest them all. However, this place also has some of the best Salt and Pepper calamari I've ever had."}
{"text":"Bad pho is easy to find. Pho this good is not. The menu includes almost every variety of Pho possible, including a great curry option and different noodle options. It's not fine dining, but that's not why you come here. It is clean if dated, very quick service (efficient, not polite). Well worth the trip and I'll be back. Not quite as good as Pho Bang, but much more accessible to the East Valley."}
{"text":"Oh Saigon Pho, how I've missed you! My favorite of Vietnamese restaurants, so good no amount of scraping off that hateful cilantro will make me stop coming here. 

Only losing a star for adding this new egg cake thing to my plate (kind of yucky, really). But the braised beef and shrimp is still great. And no one else has the crunchy pickled veggies I've become so accustomed to. If only you would open a location in Phoenix!

Two years living in the land of zero Vietnamese food was enough. I know where to get my fix now. :)"}
{"text":"If you  love spring rolls and egg rolls then  this is the place you want to eat.
Also they serve food really fast.
great Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Had another bad service . We were seated always at the corner. I waited for check fir 20 minutes, no refills.. Never ever coming back... They cut down on the meat too."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Tucson and was looking for a new place for pho. I'm am pleased to say that this place is great! My son and I arrived at 1130... we were sat immediately and we ordered the spring rolls and pho soup. The spring rolls arrived about 2 minutes after we ordered them and the soup arrived about 5 minutes after we ordered it. Super fast and friendly service! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and it was moderately busy. I have been here quite a few times in the past. After living in central Phoenix I decided to give it another try. Bad idea! After waiting much too long to get served, I got my usual Pho. I think it is one of the worst in the valley. Service is bad and rude waitresses who don't mind yelling in your ear as you try to enjoy a meal. Unfortunately, I have a groupon that I will not be using"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm Soup! Soup for you and soup for you and soup for you. One of my favorite Pho restaurants in Chandler. The little boys especially love the big spoons and chopsticks! Definitely a family spot to visit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You just need to know what you want or go with someone that speaks Vietnamese to make sure you are getting what you want. 
I really like the beef noodle soup and the vegetable rolls. Sometimes for lunch if I am driving by, I just order their vegetable rolls to go and it is enough to fill me for lunch. Wide range of other food as well that has some very good authentic flavor like the chow fun."}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot and wasn't disappointed the second go around. Got sliced beef and veggie pho, the service was so quick and I ate the whole bowl!! Will definitely come back- fresh veggies and tasty, warm broth."}
{"text":"Worst service  I have ever seen !!!!!! I went there last night !!I only had my discover card with me !!! Then I asked the boss (she said she is the boss .btw who cares)\"why can I not  use discover\"? ??? Then she rolled her eyes and yelled at me!!!!omg!!! What the hell  did you say ?boss!!! Omg, because you are the boss then u think you can yell at your customers??? Ok, I won't ever go back to this place again ."}
{"text":"Very good food; beef chow fun, fried tofu and fried rice"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Vietnamese restaurant.. Pho is great, and so are the egg rolls. Very reasonably priced. The good is always fresh, and comes out quickly.

Customer service has improved a lot since the last time I was here. I probably come here twice a month. It's not that the service was bad... It just wasn't friendly. 
They would take your order-bring you water, then your food, and you would never see anyone again. If you needed something, you'd have to get up and seek someone out, which seemed to annoy them. 

Now, they have someone check on you constantly, not too much.. Just enough, and the girls are much friendlier. Because of their kindness, this place is now a five star in my book."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is super friendly. The food is great. And inexpensive. Order anything from a bowl of Pho to salt and pepper shrimp and it is first rate."}
{"text":"I like Saigon.  I usually get the chicken w/ lemon grass, can't remember the number.

Downfalls are the facility, dated and dingy, and the quality of the meat.  At the prices they are charging, you aren't going to get all white meat chicken or the better cuts of beef and pork."}
{"text":"I have been eating there since before I can remember. My mom used to take me and now I bring my bf there all the time.

The waitresses are always very nice and they know me so well they know our order before I even have to look.

We always split two order of the egg rolls and go back and forth between sharing the charbroiled pork, egg cake, and (I always forget what it is called but the cold pork with noodles).

I also love their rice noodle salads, their chow fun, tofu, summer rolls, and wonton soup.

I have never seen any bugs and it's always clean.

They remodeled a wile ago and though the booths are new I don't like how short they are. It makes the meal less private.

It's the one place my mom and sister miss the most after moving to Oregon."}
{"text":"The service here was horrible. From the moment we began ordering our server seemed to have a chip on her shoulder. When we got our food it wasn't exactly what we thought so we asked to send it back. The server was increasingly rude after this and continued to tell me that it was what I ordered. As a consumer, all I was looking for was an apology and new plate of food. Our server never returned and instead a new one arrived and proceeded to slam our plates down on the table. I can easily say I will never return and will encourage others to not even bother going! Save your time and money... Not worth it!"}
{"text":"I struggled to give this place 4 or 5 stars. It is truly one of my favorite \"hole in the wall\" places. Their food is delicious and their prices cannot be beat. My one qualm is their meat quality is a little questionable, though I must say its expected with the prices."}
{"text":"My families favorite Saturday or everyday or anyday resto eveeeer!!! I love how fast their serving time is. Employees are ALWAYS wonderful! And they have great FRIED EGGROLLS! My kids, (6 and 3) loves them too! The price is FANTASTIC! Everything is cheap and the flavor is to die for!"}
{"text":"Been going here for over 10yrs now...my husband loves it too. Great Prices and Great Food! We try to go here weekly since it's cheaper than cooking. I love the seafood, Lobster Salt and Pepper is our Fav! And the SP Squid. The Pho is so far the best I've had. They are sometimes not as consistent on the quantity of food as for family style eating but most of the time they have a great serving for the price. My kids ask to eat here all the time, especially when under the weather and in winter for the soups! Very affordable! Especially on seafood."}
{"text":"This has quickly become our go to local restaurant for the wonderful food, the variety of options, and the great price. I have no complaints about the service either. 

My one complaint is that the booths are a bit poorly built, which sometimes leads to jostling from other parties from behind. But this is relatively minor and I am happy to simply try to avoid booths which have rambunctious parties on the other side."}
{"text":"Went in tonight with my wife and the place was packed. We were seated in 5 minutes max and were served our drinks immediately. Our server took our order and apologized in advance because she said the kitchen was a bit behind. 10 minutes later our order was served and the waitress refilled our drinks several times. The pho was good and there was plenty. We are from Northern Cal and I have been to plenty of Vietnamese restaurants and I would put this one up there with my favorites now."}
{"text":"The place is looking good with a recent face lift -- new paint / wall pictures / pendant lighting... I'd also bet money the folks here are CBS (Chinese Born in Saigon) as I hear the staff speaking in Chinese and based on some of the offerings...

I bounce around on the meu alot, b/c I haven't found THE dish that makes me want to order it over and over again.  My bf is a fan, so we come here regularly due to its proximity and good value for the money.  I am impressed with the friendly service, it's a notch above what I'm used to receiving in pho shops.

Regularly consuming:

#2 Viet Shrimp & Veg Rolls -- these aren't the deep fried rolls, aka spring rolls elsewhere.

#21  Duck w/ Egg Noodle Soup -- love / hate relationship... I love duck, and its tender falling off the bone... but the broth can be sweet which is off putting.

#24 Charbroiled Pork & Egg Roll w/ Noodle -- vermicelli noodles served with fish sauce, as I find their beef pho broth just eh.

Any one of the \"dessert\" items which I treat like a drink, the drinks are soooo refreshing during our hot summers."}
{"text":"Ill keep this short and sweet.
Pros :
1. Awesome hospitality
2. Fast service(when i say fast, u place order & in 5 mins ur food's ready) 
3, Food is is home-made style and quality is good. 
4. The restaurant is spacious. 

Cons:
1. Very busy on weekends but they use only one side of the restaurant.  
2. One restroom stall."}
{"text":"Wow. I absolutely love this place. My dad and I have been eating here longer than I can remember. The service is as great as the cuisine. My 2 personal favorites are the charbroiled lemon grass curry chicken, and the beef ball and brisket soup. But the shareable classics for us will always be the house special chicken, the salty pepper squid, and an order of egg fried rice."}
{"text":"For East Valley, this is my favor place for Vietnamese noodles.  Saigon Pho is Amazing.  I love their egg rolls, spring rolls, and my favor dish is their rice noodles.  Every time I visit there is packed.  Very very tasty.  Outside it doesn't look anything special.  Inside is surprisingly spacious and comfortable.  They have two dinning rooms.  On the right when you get in, they have a dinning room that most of the time empty, which I actually preferred to be more quiet and enjoy my dishes with friends or family.  Thumb Up!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always great. Full of flavor and the meat is tender. Everything we have tried is great. Some of the things we like is the salt and pepper calamari. Recommend #40 order it with crispy noodles and what ever meat you like. Pho  is always good too. Or the vermicelli noodles with pork chops and grilled shrimp."}
{"text":"We ordered the lemongrass chicken. I like the strong flavor and saltiness that tasted good with hot white rice. The dish came as a heaping plate of chicken and onions that were still firm, which I liked. 

We also ordered the shrimp spring roll appetizer, which comes with a Hoisin dipping sauce that included a bit of shredded carrots and peanuts.  I thought that it tasted fresh with the basil and crispy lettuce. There were white rice noodles in it and the wrapper was nicely elastic-like."}
{"text":"I am downgrading my rating significantly for this place after I got sick eating the number 51 basil chicken meal.  It all started about 3 hours after eating here when I had to go for a sit-down in the bathroom.  That was not the end of it as I ended up with four or five more chips into the bathroom.

I think this place must be keeping their chicken too long as there are very few dishes on the menu with chicken which is probably why they end up keeping there's too long.

The other issue with this is that I can understand having a bad meal at a restaurant but in this case on my next visit here I made one of the sisters of the owners aware of what happened and she never did even apologize for the bad meal and try to say it must have been something else that I ate.  Very poor public relations on their part."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in the Valley! We go here about once a month. Some of my favorite dishes are the whole fish, salt and pepper shrimp, Pho with everything in it, Spring rolls, Shrimp/Pork over rice noodles, and the Seafood over soft egg noodles. We also have the Vietnamese coffee as our dessert! YUM!"}
{"text":"I give them a lot of credit for serving a wide variety of vietnamese dishes in a city that's easy for restauranteurs to take the easy route and do what's typical and still get enough business. The ca kho (caramelized clay pot catfish) and canh chua (sour soup with okra and taro stems) are hard to find in general,  popular in Vietnamese homes and done very well here. Never had their pho - suggest ordering their more atypical items!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this restaurant.  The employees are THIEVES.   My daughter left her phone on the table and went back to get it from the parking lot.  When she got back to the table the phone and the tip was gone.  The employees claimed they didn't have or see the phone.  I used Lookout security to locate the phone 4 hours later at the restaurant and returned.  When I did the employees again played innocent.  We then made the phone scream using the software.  When we did someone in the restaurant stashed the phone in the men's bathroom in the toilet brush holder (YUK).   Proof is that an employee had the phone and wouldn't give it up to me or my daughter until they couldn't silence it and had to stash it in the bathroom.  Again, nothing but a bunch of thieves work there and they'll steal from you any chance they get."}
{"text":"Being from the Bay Area (in CA), and being used to quite an assortment of ethnic foods, my expectations were not super high. I was very pleasantly surprised when I walked in and it *smelled* of Asian spices and Vietnamese food! My friend and I ordered lunch for ourselves (beef pho and the beef noodle soup), which was really good. We also ordered dinner for our families, since we were in town for the Lost Dutchman swim meet and wanted to expedite dinner after the meet. 

I got two orders of the pork/egg roll with vermicelli, I also got lemongrass chicken and the beef chow fun. All of which was great! Service was quick and attentive, food was delicious and reasonably priced! 

If you are in/around Chandler, and looking for some yummy Vietnamese food, I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I come here often. Can't beat the price! #2 is amazing (spring rolls). Most places give you a peanut sauce which I am not a fan of, but here they give you one that is more sweet. Sometimes the shrimp in it has a weird texture, though. I also get the #18 but it's inconsistent. It's never BAD, but sometimes it's amazing other times just okay."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday celebration at the recommendation of a friend. The restaurant is in a small strip mall which housed an Old Spaghetti Factory many years ago. Upon entering we were quickly seated in one of two dining areas. Since we had a group of 8 plus 2 kids, we had the area to ourselves for a while until it started getting busier. We had brought a homemade cake with us but did not ask ahead of time if this was permitted. In hindsight, it was probably rude to have done so and we noticed several glares from the staff. We were seated and placed orders for a variety of dishes. One person in our group ordered the sour lemonade which was like pickled briney sour brown lemonade. We all had a chance to sample this item and quickly determined that it was very different than anything we had tasted. All of the food was very fresh and tasty. The only complaint was one person ordered the pho ga and the chicken was a bit old. We will return, sans cake, for the great food."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Phoenix and the best price.  No place better and no place cheaper.  Me an My wife go back again and again. Very Very Very good.  12 - 14 dollars two people with water as drink. you can't beat that."}
{"text":"This place is great and I eat here often. The food is very good and the prices are great.  Took a friend and we ordered egg rolls, spring rolls, and two main courses, think it was curry chicken noodle soup and a spicy chicken over rice. The bill was under $20. A Vietnamese friend recommended this place and I have been eating here ever since!"}
{"text":"TL;DR
Abovu average food, very very slow services.

We had dinner here on Tuesday night, not exactly busy. The food is good. But the services is beyond slow. We waited at least 15, if not 20 before they come to order the food. We rall the waiter and they just refer us to someone else. We order 2 pho, and the spring roll. Interestingly the pho got here before the spring. The worse part is we have to wait another 20mins, call the waiter three times before we get the bill"}
{"text":"Saigon Pho isn't the most glamorous restaurant on the inside or outside, but when you're so hung-over from last Friday night all you really care about is downing that bowl of Pho. What I like about Saigon Pho is that the staff is very friendly while giving efficient service. I did not think the broth and the meat is in the Pho is up there with the other good Pho places I've been to, but the price is spot- 6.50 for a bowl of Pho. I believe Pho Saigon won't blow you away, but will satisfy your Pho needs at a fair price point."}
{"text":"I ate pho almost every week for 5 years in Richardson, TX. That town has the highest number of Vietnamese people of any city in Texas. So I know pho.

I haven't lived in Arizona for long, but to my knowledge, this is, by far, the best pho restaurant (of the 4 I've been to) in the Phoenix area. For a fact, only La Me is the only Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to that is THIS good and it's not even namely a pho restaurant.

My opinion is based on the overall combination of quality and creativity of the food, restaurant, price."}
{"text":"Im a pho snob and I give this place a 5. The spring and egg rolls are excellent as well. There may be a wait but its well worth it. There are 2 bars next to the resturant so its an easy way to kill tine :-)."}
{"text":"OK so call me a sucker but I went back because it was Monday and several of my other \"go-to\" lunch spots were closed. Much to my surprise, Saigon Pho is BACK!

After a horrible dip in quality, something happened and the food is back up to par as it had always been.  I've now been back four times just to confirm my finding and each time it's been great.  I couldn't be happier because I've yet to find a place with broth like theirs.
 

Welcome back Saigon Pho.  You have sorely been missed."}
{"text":"Pho is my go to meal when I'm sick or down or fantastic... pretty much all the time. This place was close by my in laws so I figured I would try them out. Any it was wonderful! They did not disappoint. It will never be as good as my grandmother's, but it hits the spot when I'm craving pho. I personally recommend the #10. But if you're not feeling like you want pho, try the #21 (duck with egg noodle soup). Both are pretty good options. You can call in to order for pickup, and they'll have it ready by the time you get there! I've always received great service from them. They even remembered me after it had been months since I went last which made me feel pretty awesome. It's safe to say I will definitely keep coming back time and again."}
{"text":"This is my Pho restaurant of choice in AZ.

I've probably tried half the menu in the 7 years I've been a patron on Saigon Pho.  Other than the regular pho choices, I'd recommend the Spicy Grilled Lemongrass Chicken, Crispy Chicken, Salt & Pepper Squid, and a host of others..

If you are in the mood for soup, but not the usual pho, order the Beef Stew Noodle Soup w/ egg noodles.

Saigo Pho has very good portions.  You've probably tried your luck with other pho places and have felt short changed as the quantity of noodles in your bowl.  you won't have a problem with that here.

The prices are fair.

The wait staff is always friendly and attentive.  It's not like the usual Asian places where they don't ever come around and refill your glass with water."}
{"text":"This is my 'go to' pho house in the Chandler area.  The prices are good ~5 to $6 for a bowl of pho.  The staff is friendly and the quality is on par.  My one complaint is that it is not especially clean.  

My picks:

#16  spicy beef pho

Pho Ga( chicken pho(white meat))

fried tofu"}
{"text":"Stevey does Chandler, Part I.  I know, can you believe it?  I do know how to go south and east of Tempe ya know?  I actually go there quite frequently (but not as often lately).  Where else am I gonna go to get my Asian grub on?  The area around Dobson/Warner is an emerging hub in Arizona for some bomb-ass Asian cuisine, and Saigon Pho is helping lead the way.

This place is crazy busy - especially on weekends - when I am usually able to hoof it down there.   I've been coming here for a while now.  The shrimp and beef bowl over noodles and the hot pot soups are both only about $5 - and a very tasty $5 at that.   An A+ for the smooth, but not too sweet Thai iced tea.  One drawback over the several times was finding a little gnat critter kickin it in my shrimp summer roll - an isolated incident I'm sure - but you should def.  know.

It's a bit nicer than most, inside it's little restaurant strip mall.  It looks kinda like it was an old diner in a previous incarnation from the naugahyde booths and cheap tile floors throughout.  They even have a fish tank, but it's not full of tropical fish, rather it's full of we're-about-to-cook-you crab."}
{"text":"I have been coming here with my family for many years now. I love their food and prices but is it me or do they put less meat in their pho now? I wanted to get their special pho a few times before actually writing up a review. Each time, I was left with much less meat then there use to be, yet the price is still the same? I feel like there is only noodles and perhaps 3-5 pieces of meat. Really? Please don't be so cheap. I am sure you can add more meat, after all, I did order the meat combo special. The broth use to be something to be desired but it is now more bland then ever. Don't be fooled my fellow yelpers, there are far plenty places around town that have more pungent and flavorful pho with MEAT (I mean, if you're into that). 

They've gotten better at filling up our waters, thank goodness because it use to be God awful when they'd never come by to fill your water and you'd have to LITERALLY chase them down just so they can fill a tiny cup with water. 

Their bean and jelly sweets are great. Thai tea is wonderful. And the price is just right."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Viatnamese place in town. I've been going there for about 10 years now, and love it every time. 

I often order takeout as well, and it's always ready lightning fast!

I have so many favorites, so it's difficult to make a recommendation. But the egg rolls (#1) are a must have! The spring rolls (#2) are also tasty if you're looking for something a little healthier.  For entrees, I love the chicken pho (#14) when I want something simple or the rice and egg noodle soups (#18 and #19?) when I'm looking for more variety. The noodle bowls are awesome as well--#28 is nice because they'll chop up egg rolls and put them right in your bowl. Yum! As a plus, prices for any of the above top out at around $6.95.

The only thing I wouldn't recommend is getting one of Saigon's few fusion dishes--teriyaki chicken, for example. Stick to a strictly Vietnamese dish.

I would score a 5/5 for sure except a friend of mine did get sick there once a few years ago. I haven't had it happen in 10 years, so it may be a fluke. Still, I figure it's good to know!"}
{"text":"The broth is good, the smells are incredible, and the servings are generous.  The only downside I have to this experience is that it just isn't QUITE there in terms of full pho flavor.

I tend to be overly critical of VIetnamese food in general since I always had high quality authentic food at home growing up.  I was skeptical when my co-workers suggested it. 

However, good experience, good atmosphere, and a GREAT price.  Bigger plus for being close to work AND for having Vietnamese soy milk!

Oh it's a bit hard to see, but it's in a strip mall on the East side of the road next to a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I forgot to edit this review!  I had lunch with Christine at Saigon a couple of weeks after my 4/4/2014 visit and had a better experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. If you are non-Vietnamese you will be in the minority if you go there -- which is a good sign I assume.

Tonight was our 3rd visit. Good family style restaurant that is reasonably priced and quick service.

We have the pork and shrimp, the beef and shrimp, and the salt and pepper shrimp. Excellent every time!"}
{"text":"Always good consistent food and service, and reasonable prices. 

I get the #12 (pho with sliced beef) and #1 (egg rolls).

I recently took my unsophisticated small-town mother-in-law from the Midwest and she even liked it (although she only had egg rolls and tea)."}
{"text":"Saigon Pho is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant!  I've been dining here for nearly two years now and love this restaurant dearly. My boyfriend and I dine here two to three times a week. The food and service continues to bring us back, and our love for Vietnamese food continues to grow! I've practically have had just about almost everything on the menu and have not found many items I did not like. 

The beef salad is amazing... to die for! It is served with your side of white rice, with  lemon salt and pepper dipping sauce. Believe me, it is fantastic! You will fall in love and come back for more. Not forgetting your traditional Pho, something that is a must have and try! You cannot go to Saigon Pho and not have Pho... rice noodle soup with beef and beef balls, served with sprouts, lime, and basil leaves. There are sauces to add to enhance the flavor. Once everything is added, you indulge!  

Some of my other favorite dishes are; the special crab, clams with basil, and steam flounder.  They cost a bit more if you don't mind splurging a tad to enjoy the taste of how each item is well put together. These items are normally shared-so for the price, it is worth feeding at least two people. 

Beside for the seafood items, everything else on the menu is affordable and decently priced. Nothing is overly priced for the amount of food served. The servers are extremely friendly, quick and nice... I've gotten to know almost every single one of them to the point where it is a little embarrassing when I walk in and they say, \"Wow.... you come here again?!\"  There are never any long waits and most of the time, we are sat right away. They come by so often to check on you... So basically it is impossible for your drink to be half empty. Good deal, eh?! I have and will continue to enjoy this restaurant. So if and ever you are in Chandler, Arizona make a quick stop here and give yourself a decent meal you won't forget!"}
{"text":"Best pho place in the east valley and prices are fantastic. I am a huge fan of the fresh spring rolls. I ordered a seafood pho, meatball pho, shrimp fried rice, and order of fresh spring rolls for $25. Definitely a favorite!"}
{"text":"Pho was good , but not 4 star quality .... over crowed  and service was below average."}
{"text":"Average pho shop on Alma School. Cheap, quick and friendly service. All dishes are ~$7. Menu also offers vermicelli bowls and plenty of over-rice options."}
{"text":"Love their food I was introduced to this my first time and I absolutely loved it, I go here very often and enjoy my peppered fries shrimp , soups are delicious"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place! 
favorites: Pho, fried egg rolls, beef salad, their sweet and sour is unlike any other, if you are yearning for chicken, try #50 and oh don't forget Vietnamese coffee"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese food on the east side! My fave dishes in no particular order are:
Appetizers:
-Pork egg rolls not like Chinese egg rolls but 10 times better! Comes in 2 with the romaine lettuce and mint leaves to wrap it all up ready to dip in that pungent yet flavorful saltiness fish sauce -nig mum sauce. 
-Vietnamese shrimp & veggie rolls made of shrimp, vermicelli noodles, mint leaves, cilantro and sprouts. This is dipped in the peanut hoisin sauce. Yummy! 

Rice dish:
- charbroiled beef and shrimp with egg cake over rice dish. The beef is marinated really well and tenderized to anyone's liking. Comes with their pickled shreds and slices of cabbage, cucumber and carrots. Again, the nig mum sauce to pour all over the dish. 
-charbroiled curry chicken and lemongrass over rice. Strong flavors make this dish tasty!
-house special fried rice was an all around great staple for those that are afraid to try anything new. Mix in a bit of Siracha sauce for a little kick. 

Pho (soup)
-Saigon beef rice noodle soup aka pho. An assortment of beef and its counterparts. Such a nice comfort soup especially on a rainy day!

4 stars because the decor has been the same for at least a decade. But the food is definitely a 5 star in my book."}
{"text":"We ordered this to go and had I delivered across town to our ER for dinner...and it was still awesome!!! The pho was amazing!"}
{"text":"the price, the taste and the quality of the pho all get 5 stars!!!! 
i can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Very Saigon food, which is a combination of French and American influences. We ordered the #10 (chicken pho) and #14 (beef combo pho). The broths were both very good, but the exclusion of the notorious \"saw tooth herb\" from the plate of vegetables was odd. Also, no fresh cilantro? But they put raw onions on top of the pho soup when it's served to the customers' table? Maybe that's a preference for some, but for me, I expect the onions to be heated thoroughly during the creation of the broth itself. This is standard practice I see in other Vietnamese restaurants as well as when I make pho myself. And I grew up with Vietnamese neighbors too, so this is even more head-scratching for me.

That aside, like I said, the broth is very good, and the price point is appropriate. Ambiance is nicer, and so is the music that plays in the background.

But that's where the positives end, and for me, a bunch of question arise.

Why are there so few appetizer options? It seems odd that there are only five options at the time that this review came out, and only two of them involve rice paper. Seriously, there are so many more possibilities of appetizers to serve, and I can confirm that the restaurant HAS these things; for instance, charbroiled pork, carrots, cucumbers, shrimp, lettuce, mint, basil. That right there, you could spin off as a \"make it yourself\" rice wrapper dish swapping out some of the aforementioned ingredients. But instead, the restaurant chooses to only offer two, prebuilt spring rolls with peanut sauce on the side. I'm not saying these aren't delicious; they are, but offer more when you clearly can. By the way, this place cheaps out on the lettuce used in their spring rolls; instead of using the more nutritious and traditional green leaf lettuce, Saigon Pho & Seafood decides that iceberg lettuce is the way to go. While I understand that iceberg lettuce certainly reduces overhead costs for a restaurant, it really takes a dive on the culinary experience when your customers know that you're using cheap ingredients, and furthermore, non-nutritious vegetables.

The customer service here is good, but frankly, I don't go to Vietnamese restaurants to experience great customer service. In fact, when I was younger, I opted to find the restaurants with the worst service possible under the impression that I'd get higher quality food. While that has certainly been refuted in my ever-increasing experience dining out, I feel like there is still at least a shred of truth associated with this notion. If you're focusing more on customer service, less attention is paid to the food.

Now, I want to touch upon the vegetables briefly. It's important to note that Vietnamese cuisine is really about textures, so, when the vegetable dish that came out to put into your soup contained only bean sprouts and Thai basil, I really had to scratch my head. Where was the cilantro? What about sawtooth herb? Where were these delectable things that I hoped to put into my soup? More authentic Vietnamese places will offer these, especially the ones back in Los Angeles or even close by in Central Phoenix (I'm looking at you, Pho Thanh!)

All in all, I'd only come back to this establishment if I lived closer and I didn't want to make the drive out to Pho Thanh or a different Vietnamese restaurant. But, until I move closer to Chandler, I'll be avoiding Saigon Pho & Seafood for now.

Until next time, Yelp!"}
{"text":"Saigon Pho is just down the street from where I live. I am not super familiar with the menu, but sometimes I get a craving for a big bowl of pho. So...that's all I've ever ordered there. The menu isn't super descriptive, and I have trouble differentiating the difference between the seven different types of beef noodle soup. The staff has a hard time communicating the differences themselves, so you are sort of on your own.
I recommend the spicy beef noodle soup. It has a thicker broth, wide noodles, tomatoes, cucumbers, peanuts, and sliced beef. You also get a condiment tray and a plate of the usual vegetables to dress your soup the way you like it.
The atmosphere is typical strip mall, but the prices are too."}
{"text":"Forget the pho; their spring rolls are unbelievable.  Okay, don't forget the pho-- I would recommend getting it with charbroiled shrimp.  Mmmm.  Service is speedy, prices reasonable, and the food is tasty.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"Great Pho, eggrolls, spring rolls, and iced coffee.  This place is always PACKED on Saturdays around 7pm and all sorts of interesting Asian dishes are going out to tables.  If you need some good Pho, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious pho, spacious environment, and very clean.  Staff worked with our peanut allergy to provide a safe meal as well."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Saigon for many years and will continue to return. The food is great and the service is friendly (though not all the servers speak English as a first language). Food-wise, I love their chicken curry noodle pho. It comes with a coconut curry broth, carrots, chicken, and the pho noodles. You can add the typical additions, but I tend to eat mine the way it is served. I also would recommend either the fried tofu or the salt and pepper calamari. Each is nice and crispy and serves as a great appetizer for the table. I also love the charboiled pork with broken rice. It is full of flavor. Saigon pho is one of the stops I must make when I come home."}
{"text":"This place rocks, I have been there 10 times and have never been let down.  I always get  #17 with egg noodles (spicy beef noodles), and a #67 (Longyan and sugar cane) to drink."}
{"text":"The waiter barely spoke English but was really nice.  Food was excellent and plentiful.  Decoration is minimalist but since the food is great,  so cares. Great little place for lunch.  Will definitively go back there again."}
{"text":"Good food at the cheap price. I always order the fresh rolls and Pho#13. Service is quick. Water is alway filled. By far the best Pho I've found around this area."}
{"text":"Saigon Pho on Alma School in Chandler should never be compared to anyone else using that name. We went there last night for the thousandt time and still loved the food, menus and taste. This place is a clean no frills friendley and fast service restaurant. Not only is the food terrific it taste good and almost everything on the menu is under $7.00. Yeah I said $7.00 it  not a typo. We had an opening of fried Salt and Pepper Squid or (Calamari) for you Italainas and of course iot was tender and crispy with a geneous portion. I also had to order the Saigon Noodle soup that has Oxtail, Tendons and meatballs which sounds weird but taste out of this world. That bowl in itself is hard for a big guy to finish. That was $6.50. Ridiculously affordable as I could see with whole familie od 12 eating in the next didning area.
Depending on the day they also can have live lobster, Tilapia, Crab and so on.
Not all the food is made with Oxtails or Tendons so if you not adventurous there's plenty to choose from thta well worth ordering. Try The Cuury Chicken soup with Chicken, Curried Brith, Basil, Bean Srouts and Jalepenos. Way over the top, Huge and oh so delicious. This is one little restaurant  thats worth the drive from wherever you are."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom for lunch and we both left I unsatisfied. We order fried fish and calamari. The calamari was good but extremely salty. The fish was. Ginormous with little fish meat and a lot of fish eggs. Both my mom and I couldn't finish our meal because of the fish eggs. Makes my skin crawl just thinking about it."}
{"text":"As a Southern California native, I've been pretty spoiled with pho all of my life. I stopped by this joint while visiting Arizona and I was very satisfied! I had the rare beef and brisket pho and the spring rolls. The peanut sauce that they use for the spring rolls was different from any I've had before, it was pretty tasty! Instead of being on the creamy side it was more of a hoisin-looking sauce with peanuts on top. Spring rolls were your typical shrimp and pork rolls, nice and refreshing. The broth was good and the meat/noodle/broth ratio was very fair. They have two aquariums with live crab and lobster in the back which is pretty cool to check out! Their menu isn't strictly Vietnamese, there were some Thai dishes on there as well that I'd be interested in. Overall it was a pleasant experience that satisfied my pho craving while I was traveling."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food i have had in the phoenix area. 

Its all about the #17 (spicy beef noodle soup) and #2 (spring rolls), have to get these almost every time now. Other food is good as well, with some i have seen that just seem ok but they have so many options i wouldn't order those anyway.

Place is a little old inside but can be overlooked for the taste and value. And they are quick, so good option for lunch."}
{"text":"Ok, ok, so the service is pretty lacking now and then, but I swear, it is the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant that I have found by far. I really enjoy the Chinese hot pot, fried tofu, Duck pho and Beef pho. It's very reasonably priced and it's so so delicious. The seats, booths and walls should take a good scrubbing, but I really cannot complain about the food here.. it reminds me of the food my mom used to cook."}
{"text":"Hubby and I met a couple of friends here for dinner tonight. It is a small restaurant, nothing much to look at, but the service was super friendly and amazingly fast.

I had egg rolls that were pretty awful- inside was a ground up unidendifiable mash. Really couldn't identify the tastes either. Hubby's spring roll was nothing to write home about, and he thought that the ones he had at Pholicious were far better. 

My entree was quite tasty, though- the beef chow fun (dry) might just have been the best I've had in the Valley. Hubby had to add all the sauces given to him just to give his tofu and veggie noodle dish some flavor. One friend loves their curry pho, and the other friend just repeatedly called her dish \"spicy\" and didn't eat much of it.

We've had better overall and will keep searching for a good pho place- and one in our part of town."}
{"text":"This our our go to place for Vietnamese food.  We've never had a bad meal and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  Don't worry if you've never tried Vietnamese food they will gladly make suggestions."}
{"text":"Consistently good.  Not fancy but always enjoyable.  Healthy choices available; I had the vegetable rice soup and it was great!"}
{"text":"The food was good until we found a bug in the jalapeños. We told our waitress & she looked really shocked & just said \"oh!\". She just walked away. Then another waitress came to ask us how we were doing & I told her about the bug & showed it to her on the plate & she said \"that's the jalapeño seed\" & we said \"no, the seeds are white & this bug is black, you can even see its legs!\" & she just said \"oh yeah!\" & walked off with the plate that had the bug on it. I thought she was going to talk to the manager so we kept waiting for someone to come back to the table but they avoided us after that. Not once did they offer to bring a replacement or give us a discount neither. Then when I went to pay the same waitress who was trying to tell us it was a seed cashed me out & didn't offer to give us a discount or let us speak with the manager. Definitely not coming here again! I wish I took a picture of it before they took it away. It sucks too because before that the food was pretty good & a couple people had recommended this place. If they had been more accommodating then I would've brushed it off & said it was a fluke. What a waste of money!"}
{"text":"Their wonton noodle soup is my favorite dish! It's not a fancy place but the food is wonderful, and the prices are great. Their Vietnamese iced coffee tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Been craving on Pho for some time now, and so i decided to invite a friend to this place for her first Pho ever and my first Pho in three years. Saigon Pho is a neat small Vietnamese restaurant located conspicously from its flashy bar neighbors Iguana Mack and Dos Gringos.

I was feeling beefy and brave that day so i got the #10 (thank you Yelp reviewers, nice choice), brave btw is for the portion of an uncooked beef on my hot soup, which i didn't eat but added a distinct flavor. #14 Chicken broth is spot-on good broth (which i got on another day). Shrimp and vegetable rolls or egg rolls are crunchily delicious if you are up for an appetizer.

Now it is true that a full bodied beef broth is flavorful and it is what makes a Pho stands out, but i have to say for the purpose of eating healthy, the more flavor there is the more fat and calories, not to mention the sodium if it has one, there are in the beef broth. This one, though, falls a tad short on the flavor, so i just season it, a good thing because it gives me a choice without compromising the freshness of the bean sprouts and mint. 

My friend and i stayed here for about thirty minutes on a Sunday afternoon and although they don't have a maximum customers, i notice the waiters are hovering around our table a lot as if they wanted us to leave, which i think is the only negative experience i have with this place.

Three stars and i would most likely come back."}
{"text":"This is our go to authentic Vietnamese restaurant. When we go here we know our experience will always be consistent. The service is lightning fast and the food comes out just as quickly. We can not  go here without ordering the Vietnamese egg rolls."}
{"text":"This place has the best Pho in town. Actually everything here is amazing! I would of gave this place a 5 star but the servers are always unhappy. Most of the staff are very rude."}
{"text":"This is still one of my two favorite Viet restaurants in AZ, this and the little food stand in the Mekong Plaza, Hue Gourmet.  My favorite here is the duck with wheat noodles."}
{"text":"Don't order their combination Pho - it comes with actual balls of fat, tripe and tendons! Instead, you'll want to order the ALL rare beef Pho and you have to tell them that you don't want any tripe, tendons or fat. This place is much nicer and cleaner than my favorite Phu place in Mesa but the food, portion and price isn't as good."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pho restaurant, and the prices can NOT be beat.They have a cute little place with a big fish tank full of fresh crabs and lobster and the pho is amazing. I recommend the #25 Its a beef rice noodle dish topped with crunchy spring rolls, lots of veggies and their sauces are divine. No, it's not actually a Pho dish but it's amazing and slightly sweet and they bring it out in record time! We tried the Salt Brown Lemonade last time we were there, let me say that was an ODD drink. I usually go for the hot green tea, I like my own little pot o tea while I Pho-get. Check this place out when you're in the area, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the Springs Rolls and the Pho soup.  The decor is nothing to write home about, but the food is pretty decent."}
{"text":"great food and prices 
around $6 a plate !! 

true taste and flavor !!"}
{"text":"We had dinner and had the worst experience we ever had. Horrible food and terrible inexperience service. I had never met any rude ignorance waitresses in my entire life. I don't recommend anyone to eat at this restaurant. I would like to give below one star for everything, Soup noodle is way too salty, no sauce for egg rolls, we never received entree, each time I asked waitress, she keeps telling us coming coming with attitude. After an hour and half we could not wait so we decided to leave. I went to the counter to cancel remainder of our order and paid for what we had and we left.  The placed is dirty, food is terrible, and as for service, that was the worst service we have ever had.  Don't go there!"}
{"text":"Very VERY disappointed in the service. This was the second time I had been here this week. Yesterday I came in, they sat me in a booth, I ordered immediately because I order the same thing every time. The waitress was very short and rude, ok.. Bad day. Then she delivers my food to the imaginary person sitting across from
Me in the booth?!? Really, can't even go as far as to set the bowl in from of me huh? Maybe you should talk to your waitresses about at the very least trying. I asked for change, that ticked her off. I still tipped her $3 on a $6.46 bill. I will be back, I just hope this reaches someone who cares. This was uncalled for.. Now that I have read more reviews, it seems I'm not the only one getting bad service. Most of the more recent reviews have complained about the same thing! There are plenty of restaurants in that area that make the same food you do.. In that General area even. Better step up your game or I, as well as other loyal customers will venture down the street."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE! Waited 20 mins for food. Had to ask waitress for water and she stared at my husband for the longest time and then said, \"yea\" after he had to ask her again while pointing to the water. It was ridiculous! Got our food and it was the wrong order. The pho noodles were not even soft and were hard. When I went to complain to the head waitress on duty, all she said was, \"ok ok ok ok\". No \"thank you\" not \"I'm sorry!!\" NOTHING!! It was HORRIBLE service!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worse Pho I have ever had in the 26 years that I have eaten Pho."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular Vietnamese spots for two things, and they are:

fried rice (not on the menu)

& 

chicken curry noodle soup

Their fried rice is OH SO GOOD and greasy, reminds me of Chinatown fried rice in the Philippines and in Malaysia, the ones you get from the hawker stand. MMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmm! 

Make sure you get the house fried rice because it so good, with the fried egg, the scallions, shrimp, pork, and chinese sausage. It's that good that I can always look past the dirty Vietnamese label that Saigon Pho usually gets from Vietnamese friends. 

and, the Chicken Curry noodle soup with the rice noodle, the richness of the coconut and the thickness of the curry gravy mixed in with the rice noodle and the chunks of chicken, with a little spice, mmmm that's good eating. Oh and if you're eating in, get yourself their fresh lemonade, it's cool and really tart!!! love it. and these two menu items alone have made me a repeat customer of Saigon Pho the last 4 yrs."}
{"text":"Great pho! I got Pho Tai, beef came out nice and thin and rare. The broth was excellent.  I just hope they stay in business so I can keep coming. The broth was better than their near by competition in my opinion! There are a lot of good Pho places in Chandler,  but this one was the best I've had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Vietnamese and it was delicious. Great price for large serving. Everything was delicious. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Always packed - Always great food! Sometimes the service can be iffy but that is because they are so busy. Once you get your order in, the food comes out fast and it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it seems like the quality varies from time to time. I do love this place, I always get #11 or #49. Their spring rolls are the best! I always get it when I come. Fresh and delicious. Good place for cheap eats."}
{"text":"this is easily one of me and my family's place to go to eat. we're regulars and the staff recognize when it's been awhile since we've come in. i really enjoy the teriyaki chicken, their kalamari is really good, and they have a nice environment! kind of like one of those \"hole in a wall\" places!"}
{"text":"Cheap eats spot! You can find Chinese or Vietnamese food here the food is consistent and the price is between $6 - 8 dollar for a plate. I always come here if I want to grab a quick bite and don't want to drive too far or wait too long. Always happy here."}
{"text":"This is a great quick lunch spot! The Pho is aright not my favorite but great for the money only about $5 a bowl. They also offer many other dishes as well, their house crispy chicken, beef and basil chow fun, house fried rice, crispy egg noodles with chicken and vegetables, and their fried egg rolls are a must :-) I usually alternate between all of these dishes all of which are under $7-8 a plate."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for the past 8 years since I moved here from Vietnam, unbeatable price for Vietnamese food, I get number 43. TAKE MY ADVICE DO NOT GET PHO HERE, everything else is great the fried rice is amazing but this place serve one of the worst Pho in history of pho. The broth is bland and the meat is far from chewy so save your money and get something else."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get Pho. It's made well here. Good flavor, not too oily. The egg rolls are delicious."}
{"text":"I had the Vegetable Pho and a glass of water. 

--Price: Very reasonable, and about what I expected/hoped to pay. $5.50

--Food: It is not the best Pho I have ever had, but it was above average.  Decent amount of veggies BUT no tofu!!!  I still have to rely on Maxim for the greatest Veggie Pho (comes with tofu).

--Service: Very awesome. Soup was out before I could even let out my pre meal fart.  They consistently were getting up during their lunch meal/break to see how I was and to refill my water.

I will go back again when I do not feel like making the drive to Maxim in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Just gave another try last night to see if Saigon is worth to hold my heart, but obviously it is not. 

To be honest, I've tried real authentic Vietnamese food so if you try the food and you think it's good - then you haven't tried the real food!
Since they just changed the owner, quantity is more matter than quality. 
They just wanted to cook quickly, serve quickly to meet the demand and if someone don't know the real taste then it's their lost!

Last night we had to wait more than 15mins for the food to come out. I ordered Pho Tai with beef on the side + xtra beef (because I'd prefer to eat them medium raw) and my bowl came out as a big disappointment: They didn't use eye round steak as advertising - they used some kinda different beef and it made me wanna vomit right in the first bite. I am not talking about the siracha, I'm not talking about bean sprouts, not about any other either - I'm talking about the broth. I just felt like I ate a bowl of boiling water with some MSG!

My friend ordered Mi Hoanh Thahn (egg noodles and wonton) - she let me try the broth and both of us agreed that the broth tasted like boil water plus some xtreme fish sauce!

I'm not even try to come back here in a mean while - I can get much more than I expected at other places. 

I just feel bad for those who get deceived by the price and such.. bc they would never know they can enjoy something better than that!

Sorry Saigon, but I need to cross your name out of my list!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best I've been to, I and my twin brother Randy try Pho soup were ever we go weather it be in state or out of state, this location has great and friendly staff and if you have questions about the menu or what is in the dish they will be more then happy to explain, it's usually our date night spot on Friday night. The location is Alma School & Know in Chandler Az. And the sign is Saigon Pho just trying to clarify as there was another restraint next door but believe it's closed down."}
{"text":"Chinese restaurant posing as Vietnamese. The pho tasted like Chinese soup noodles. Even the chicken in the pho looked and tasted like stir-fried Chinese chicken you'd find in the classic Chinese-American dish, moo goo gai pan. The taste wasn't bad - maybe even decent-to-good as a Chinese dish - but I was really looking forward to Vietnamese pho! The worst part, however, was when my bowl of faux pho arrived lukewarm. I could tell it had been microwaved and apparently didn't get nuked long enough. Boo :("}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times through the years and always get either the Pho or the Bun. Everytime it is delicious, fast and inexpensive. It's a great place to take a group of people. I recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"I think Saigon has the best pho in AZ. I've gone here countless times and everything is always delicious and steaming hot.

I always go with their house pho #10. You can order it with out certain meats in it, they're very kind about it but I get it all. You can order a regular or large pho. Just beware, the large has ALOT of noodles so you probably won't finish it.

Their salt and pepper pork chops are soooo good with a bed of shredded lettuce underneath and comes with rice in a separate bowl.

Their peppered shrimp is light and crispy.

Spring rolls and eggrolls are good too. I like the spring roll more. The sauces they come with have a very subtle flavor.

I usually get calamari as an appetizer. It's a good amount.

Everything comes out so quick too! I think everything is pretty decently priced as well."}
{"text":"Been here many times and the food is good the prices are affordable and the service is outstanding the place is busy every time I go in so you know the food is good"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with a group from work,  Food was outstanding, and the  service was great. I will be back with my family."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for a long time for a reason, it's pretty good food.  The portions and prices are great and tons of people were eating inside and tons of people were ordering take out.  The staff, like typical Asians are straight to the point but friendly."}
{"text":"Tasty pho and bun, fast and friendly service. Also, if you get pho for take-out, they helpfully pack it in a cardboard box so you can get it home in your car without spillage. We're fans!"}
{"text":"I personally think that their serving sizes for pho are larger than most other places.  What may be a regular bowl at Saigon can be a large bowl at other Vietnamese places in the area. Plus, I'm a big fan of broth and it's pretty decent here.  All this for not a lot of cash.  It's just about the best bowl of pho you'll get in Chandler.

*Update*
Dropped it down a star because the last few times I've been there, the pho has been a bit sub-par (noodles were weird and they were stingy on the beef).  You really should only eat here if you live in Chandler and don't wanna drive up to the better places in Mesa, Tempe, or Phoenix.

*Update 2.0*
They've really gone downhill, based on the last two times I've gone.  I wouldn't even bother ordering pho here anymore.  The rice dishes may be it's only saving grace."}
{"text":"My favorite phone place. It is spookier good. People are nice and my wife loves the number 50 beef salad. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've tried vietnamese restaurants all around the valley and other states and keep coming back to Saigon. Like weekly. Iced coffee is a must and so are the fried egg rolls and spring rolls. I don't like shrimp in my spring rolls and they are always accommodating making them with just beef. I tend to go back and forth between pho tai and the charbroiled pork with rice noodles. The meat is tender, everything is fresh and flavorful, food comes out super quick and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 10 years,  they have some dishes unique to this restaurant only that I enjoy the pho is always great and the broken rice dishes are the bomb!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family after a suggestion from a friend. Great food, quick service, and super cheap"}
{"text":"Awesome pho, broth is very flavorful, lots of veggies, and good portion of quality beef. They also have great service and reasonable prices. Best I've found in Phoenix, looking forward to going back and trying some of their other things."}
{"text":"This place is super cheap and super yummy.  I have liked everything I have ordered here- really love the tofu dishes- EXCEPT the dessert.  Yuck!  Don't even attempt it."}
{"text":"Great authentic food, fantastic prices. Since it is out of the way, it is our Tuesday night fix."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places to eat.  Very large dining rooms and tables to accommodate large parties. I live right up the street and frequent here.  I order the 12 a lot and if I remember right the 41 (beef dish)  is really good as well.   Love the shrimp spring rolls and the Thai tea.  Lots of great food,  great service,  great place to eat."}
{"text":"Love it!!! The salt and pepper calamari is UNREAL!!!!! I also get the beef sliced pho. I love how fast the service is! I've been here 3 times in a week and I live in Scottsdale!!! Love it!"}
{"text":"My first time at this location. It was large and spacious. I order the spicy fish soup. Flavorful, somewhat spicy but I ended up adding more spice to my liking. I also ordered the fried tofu in which I was not a fan. It wasn't firm tofu so it made it difficult to eat due to lack of flavor and the texture. The service was fair. I may consider them in the future if my usual spot is too crowded or not open."}
{"text":"I always order the number 11 with a number 2. YUMMY! 
The food is good, but the service can be terrible at times."}
{"text":"Service is quick & friendly. Lunch time is busy & food servings are large. I ordered the #12-rare beef pho. Very delicious, soup is on the sweeter side. Ordered the egg rolls which was tasty too. Definitely will return to try the rice dishes."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat stir fry crabs. It's pricey but so worth it. I preferred stir fry dungness crab cooked in onions and ginger. It's so fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"This is my go to place, never that this place disappoint me. Their house fried rice is my favorite it's definitely the bomb. You can never go wrong with this place. Fast & awesome service, great food"}
{"text":"The hubs and I are suckers for some good Pho and we haven't found better in Phoenix since we moved here. The restaurant itself is nothing special but what does one expect when you can get two bowls of pho, two drinks, and crispy spring rolls for under $15? We've never eaten anything else there but in the cooler months we eat here at least 3 times a month... sometimes more =)"}
{"text":"my brother and i did a drop in on a wednesday night in june.  the place was nearly packed (with asians) and people kept streaming in during the 1.5 hrs of eating some of the tastiest pho.  how many places in AZ can boast those kind of numbers?

if you go there, ask for Lauren or her sister  (daughter of the owners).  the other waitresses are all really friendly but don't usually speak as much english and usually will refer you to one of the sisters anyways.

our 1st time there, Lauren stood at our table what seemed like 20 mins pleasantly and patiently describing all the dishes we were curious about.  she wasn't looking over our shoulder at other customers and she seemed to enjoy talking to us.

we've eaten at the old place next to Lee Lee, cyclo and this place is as good if not better and the service is exemplary of what a great dining experience should be.

i reserve 5 stars for restaurants in heaven, so this one gets 4.96 stars"}
{"text":"Saigon Pho has great and amazingly cheap Vietnemese food.
My favorites are the shrimp rolls (number 2), The Pho Tai soup
(number 12), and the Charbroiled Beef and Egg Roll over noodle (number 25).

It's incredible how many Vietnemese restaurants there are in this desert suburb named Chandler..."}
{"text":"This place was OK. I'd give it 2.5 stars. I had a bowl of pho and the worst freaking lemonade ever. It tasted like it was made of sugar and water and threw in a lemon just to pretend that it was a lemonade. I had high hopes because they place looked pretty busy for a lunch crowd, but looks are deceiving.  

I'm told I can't compare California food to Arizona food, but that is a load of crap. If you don't hold food to higher standards, how are they going to improve? I know I sound like your 7th grade teacher that tells you that you have a lot of potential, and you aren't living up to it, but thats how I feel about Saigon Pho. 

The price point is right, and they're not trying to charge me something crazy like $7 for a bowl of pho like *ahem* other places... 

I might give this place one more chance, cause my friend that went with me told me they were having an off day... but we shall see."}
{"text":"Best pho I have ever ate and got my food fast! They have great customer service and it's the cheapest pho in the valley."}
{"text":"Not the best pho. Living in Seattle area, use to great pho. Waitress messed up order 2x. Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite Pho place.  

The newly remodeled restaurant puts out wonderful and consistent Vietnamese and Chinese dishes.  We take a lot of people and out of towners here to have some awesome fresh House Crab and Lobster set in the lazy susan smack dab in the middle of huge circular table.  It sits about 10 people comfortably, but we always try to squeeze about 14 uncomfortably.   Especially when you're using your hands eating the messy dungeness crab...gotta have some elbow room!

Our usual can be some or all of these depending on the amount of people at our table:  salt  & pepper calamari, green beans & pork, Chinese broccolli, sweet & sour pork chop, crispy chicken, salt & pepper shrimp, Pho #10, char broiled beef, sea food crispy noodles and the aforementioned crab and lobster in their house sauce.  The egg rolls are delicious wrapped in green lettuce dipped in fish sauce.  My little cutie pie went on a chow fun craze, until I've had a put a stop to it, coz I was done sharing that plateful of carb overload!  Their Thai iced tea and fresh lemonade are wonderful.  When the three of us go, our dinner would only come up to a little less than $20.  It is cheaper to eat here than cooking at home!

The servers are the best.  We've never had any problems whatsoever.  They know us enough that they can pretty much guess what we're going to order!"}
{"text":"My initial thoughts of this place was of a dirty hole in the wall restaurant. When I finally stopped by I found out it wasn't so bad. I heard and driven by this place many times but never really had a hankering to stop in and try the food. 

Tonight, I was not feeling well and wanted a nice, hot bowl of Pho. I decided to finally give this place a shot. I placed my order to go (#11 Pho with beef and beef balls - $6.50 total) and took a seat and waited. I did not have to wait long, I got my food fairly fast. For the short 5-10 minutes I waited, I saw several appealing rice, noodles and seafood dishes passing by me from the kitchen to different tables that I now have to come back and try. Everything looked so appetizing which usually isn;t the case when you're feeling sick.

Anyway, back to the Pho... when I arrived home, I fixed up my hearty bowl of Pho. The portion was huge! More than I can finish. The bean sprouts, mint and lime that accompanied were nice and fresh. The broth was very flavorful and not very oily. Usually, I'd want to add a bunch of lime, hoison sauce and sriracha but tonight it was perfect with just a squirt of lime and the fresh veggies. The broth was still very hot, too. 

I will definitely go back for more Pho and also to try other items. Prices here are very affordable."}
{"text":"Yes, we schlep down here almost monthly for a Vietnamese fix 
Yes, we order by numbers - 29, 31 etc...
Yes we do get wild once in a while and order the salt and pepper squid (delicious).
Yes, its open all day so if you are channeling your inner nana, you can stop by for dinner at 3pm.
No, It's not 5 star
No, you will not get clothe napkins
No, alcohol is not served

But......

The service is exceptionally fast and this place is inexpensive.
The Vietnamese coffee will keep you buzzing for the better part of your day.

So if you are after a quick, inexpensive, Vietnamese meal..I would recommend Saigon Pho"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service! The ingredients are so fresh! I love coming here on rainy days! Great spot, cheap prices!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the pho. It had no flavor except a  strong lemon taste. Eggrolls were good but wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"Usual start off with the shrimp spring rolls.   I always get the sliced beef pho #12.  Wife will usually get the sliced chicken breast pho.   We got the #40 to share which is shrimp with fried with noodles and veggies. 

Everything we get had great taste. We usual come to this place for pho.  We think this is the best on this side of town.  The portions are big and the prices are pretty cheap.  

The service is ok. They are right to the point.  Sit here, throw you a couple menus and some water, come back in a few minutes to take you're order.  Not a lot of chit chat.  This is fine with me as I'm there to eat. 

Try the thai iced tea.  It's delish."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bowl of Hu Tieu Bo Kho (Beef stew noodle soup).  The place was filled with mostly Asians many speaking Vietnamese.  The noodle soup was filled to the brim with noodles, soup, beef.  The broth is hot and a little bit spicy.  The beef chunks are tender and the carrots chunks are perfectly softened, not too much that they break up in the soup.  The service was super fast and my noodle soup came out in record time.  I was in and out in about 25 minutes!   I want to go back and try their other soups."}
{"text":"The pho here is pretty good for a pretty cheap price. Unfortunately, the eggrolls weren't the best. It tasted like Chinese eggrolls. I've had better."}
{"text":"Knock out flavored Pho broth with usual assortment of lime, bean sprouts, cilantro and jalapenos on the side. A couple of sliced jalapenos into the broth for just the right amount of heat and ate down to the last drop. Could have had a little more meat (sliced very thin) but no complaints. A BIG repeat for a Great value at $5.50 for a Bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"For the price you can not beat this place.., ordered take out about 5 times.. I order the pho tai for $6 (last couple times I did extra meat because I like a lot of the shredded beef)
Their spring rolls are really really good and fresh 
Their egg rolls are my favorite! They are skinnier and crispy 
Don't order basil chicken as an entree (portion is huge but very plain)"}
{"text":"I have lunch at Saigon Pho a couple of times a month.  I usually have some type of Pho in the winter and Bun cold rice noodles in the summer.  Both very good.  The Egg Rolls and Spring Rolls are also a nice starter.  I would also recommend their version of Sweet and Sour Chicken, done in a light sauce and you get plenty for the price.  Another tasty dish that is kind of hidden on the menu is the Green Been with Sausage.  Really good food at a really good prices!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to treat being sick, hungover or just really hungry. The menu is good size without being overwhelming like other places. My personal favorites are the spring rolls, the fresh sliced beef rice noodle pho and the basil fried rice."}
{"text":"Gone downhill....pho full of fat chunks and a tiny bit of beef...C'mon Saigon Pho, up your game!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed that Chandler Pho wasn't open on Tuesday when I tried to go check them out, and once I'm craving pho nothing else will do.  So I drove up to Saigon based on a friend's recommendation and since I hadn't tried it before either.

Was surprised by how BIG the place is!  Looks smaller from the outside.  It was lunch time and it was packed!  I thought service would be slow, but I was pleasantly surprised when I was given water as soon as I sat down, a menu just moments later, and they came to take my order within minutes.  Did I mention the place was PACKED?

Got my pho in less time than I could do an inventory of the table to make sure I had the soy sauce and sriracha I needed.  I asked for extra onions/cilantro and again, less than 2 minutes later they were at my table.  Whoa.  These people know how to be quick.  Love it.

My pho was delicious.  I always get the pho ga (chicken), and this one was among the tastiest I've had.  

Only knock on this place is that they have Pepsi products (blech) vs Coke products, and I didn't notice if they have beer/booze since I was there for lunch.  But otherwise it was awesome, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Very authentic, love the grilled pork with some vegetable Pho. Thai tea is awesome!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite, at least once a month, Pho restaurant. The staff are courteous, friendly and efficient, and the food is excellent. As far as the Pho goes, there isn't a bad option on the menu, but the real treats are the other treasures on the menu, such as the salt & pepper calamari, which is the best I've ever had. The restaurant is large, that's a good thing because it gets pretty busy at peak times, though I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. Dinner for two, without drinks, may run you $20-25 + tip, but that's including appetizers (hint: the spring rolls are fresh and delicious), but your taste buds will thank you with every bite."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town! Ok, so I may not be the expert, but I have tried my fair share of Pho, and I will return to Saigon each and every time.

What I love about Pho...
-The flavors oh my! I know that technically Pho is just beef broth with rice noddles, but it tastes like so much more! 
-It's quick, from order to table it takes no more than 5 minutes and you have steaming flavor bowl of yum!
-You feel like you are making it yourself, you add the lime, the basil, the sprouts, the hot sauce and you have your own special bowl of goodness.

Saigon knows Pho and if you like Pho, I highly recommend you try it at Saigon!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Saigon Pho for over 15 years and while the decor has been updated a bit, the food hasn't seemed to change at all. They have the best Vietnamese food, and you'd be hard pressed to find a better bowl of pho in town. They can get pretty busy at times, but their servers are very quick and friendly. I think a few have been around since before I started going there."}
{"text":"Not the best ever but cheap and consistently good for the price. $5.95 for Pho Tai and the service is the fastest I've ever seen. Their Spring Rolls are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I gave this an A-OK rating because i'm not an expert of PHO. I like the food, but just haven't been to plenty of vietnamese places.

I ordered the spicy beef pho. It was good, very large bowl and the price was great ! This place was recommended to me by my asian friends. And i saw lots of asain peeps eating there as well, so it's probably a good place. Service was good, even though they were really busy.  I would go again, the menu has plenty of selections."}
{"text":"When I first pulled up, I wasn't even sure this place was open (still on  usiness). All the windows and doors are completely blacked out. But I tried the door and yay! Success.

Pho is dirt cheap, and still tasty.  I opt for chicken and veggies is my Pho- which was not on menu... But they served up, no problem. Service was fast even durin flinch peak. Will be back."}
{"text":"We had this place a few weeks ago and honestly were not impressed. We got our food to go. The staff was friendly and gas but the food was not as good as we had expected. Probably the biggest setback was that there was something Rock hard in one of my egg rolls. I wasn't even sure if it was food? I got sweet and sour chicken which was decent but I was surprised: places I've gotten it from in the past put the sauce on the side so it doesn't get soggy by the time you're home, but this place didn't. Plus we were disappointed that there was no sauce with the egg rolls. Maybe our expectations where just off as we're not as familiar with Vietnamese food? Could be. Either way, the something in my egg roll basically ended my appetite."}
{"text":"I misjudged Saigon the first time around. This place is awesome! I just ordered the wrong thing. 

I have returned to the restaurant several times and ordered the pho with thin noodles (I can't remember the menu number now), and it is delicious! Last night I had the salt and pepper squid and the basil beef chow fun. My meal was super tasty! It reminded me of Thien Hong, my favorite Portland restaurant. I love how they sell thai ice tea as well. It's always a perfect pairing to my dinner choice. 

I will come back to Saigon again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. My family has been coming here for years. The food is amazing and fresh. I honestly have been getting the No. 25 for as long as I can remember. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after work for a late lunch and decided to start off with the shrimp spring rolls and egg rolls. 

Shrimp Spring Rolls - I was kinda bummed that the shrimp spring rolls didn't include any pork like it usually does, but I say it wasn't too bad.

Egg Rolls - Very crispy just how I like it. 

My husband then ordered the #11 Beef and Meatball Pho and I ordered the #9 Beef Stew Noodles. Both dishes lacked flavor. The beef stew tasted so plain and barely any meat in there. I tried adding extra ingredients that were available at the table, but nothing really helped. My husband said the same thing about his Pho, plain and lacked flavor. 

On the plus side, the staff we very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for at least 3 years and still can't get enough. It's an odd location, considering they're right next door to another Chinese Restaurant, but the food here is fantastic.

The service is always quick and the food is delicious, my fave: Beef Chow Fun. This is one place I don't mind picking up the tab :)"}
{"text":"I know all pho restaurants smell to the extent of the very flavorful Vietnamese dishes but this place smelled exceptionally bad to the point where it affected my appetite and mood. 

They were very busy, which is a good sign but it was because there were two restaurants tied to only one kitchen, which of course resulted in inattentiveness, delay of our requests, and just bad service overall. 

The food was decent but not amazing enough to compensate for the disastrous service. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"At the suggestion of another yelp review, we ordered the salt and pepper squid (9.95) which was very good albeit... salty. The broth of the pho wasn't as rich as some places but still tasty.
Service was great and quick.
Ben for some reason really likes tendon so our server recommended the combination which he was thoroughly pleased with. He'd never tried tripe and now I'm afraid he likes that as well... We also ordered spring rolls, which I think are exactly the same regardless of restaurant."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with friendly staff. 

We always enjoy the service at this restaurant. The wait staff is friendly, polite & prompt. 

The family dishes are typically good. The noodle soups are savory. The beef pho, however, is typical, on par with other restaurants. 

We continue to patronize this restaurant."}
{"text":"yummy vietnam foods at arizona.

{"text":"The pho is authentic 
The service is okay 
I would definitely get the shrimp pho!
Run don't walk! You will not be disappointed. Fresh food tasty eats what else can you do any in Tucson!! Also the Thai ice tea is delicious. As the server for hot sauce !"}
{"text":"Good food at good prices. 

Been here for a few times. Had noodles and rice plates. All good but pretty standard. Service is fast. Just come in and find a place to seat and they will come and take care of you. Its quick service so don't expect them to dote on you. 

Once, we were really hungry so we got the large Thai style hot pot. It's not fancy. The broth and all the vegs are cooked already. So you just scoop on to your rice and chow down. We also got the crispy chicken (49). It's a sour broth but man, did that hit the spot. Didn't even eat it all. The small hot pots are sufficient for two people. The chicken was good and a good complement but it was a bit dry. 

It's good for your wallet too. Most dishes are  under 10$ and the large hotpot was 15$."}
{"text":"Average pho at best.  Broth was pretty flavorless.  Very one note and watered down.  Not packed with beef either - maybe three strips at the most.  In fact, the majority of the bowl was broth with minimal quantities of noodles or veggies.  Go to Pho Chandler instead."}
{"text":"When I first saw this place I wasn't sure it was open because it was so dark inside.  Inside was really dark and the music is different.  Felt like I just walked into 60's or 70's Chinese restaurant and I loved it!!!  It was so different from other pho places in Chandler.  Pho was so good, especially if you like deep flavoring stock.  Other pho restaurant their stock taste clean but lacks deep bone flavors.  You can tell Saigon's stock is at least 24 hours or older.  I can imaging bones soaking in hot boiling water and all those yummy herbs just having a good time.  I would totally say try it at least once if you love pho."}
{"text":"Coffee here is to die for!!  :[],,,  (drooling face)  It comes out with its own coffee drip and slowly brews over a layer of condensed milk.  Mix and pour over ice for an extra rich coffee with an awesome aroma!  I like coffee, and I like 'em strong!  there's no cup of joe like this. :D"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for the last several years and I live out of state still the best Vietnamese place I've eaten, spring rolls and the salt pepper shrimp Chinese broccoli number 33 and number 10 are my favorite"}
{"text":"Good food for an affordable price. Fast service and very good with packing your food. They are so mindful with how they pack your food when you order. I love their service and just overall food for such a cheap price!"}
{"text":"We always go here when we are too tired to cook during the week or as a on-the-run, default place to eat. The food is really inexpensive and good. The service is quick and the staff is friendly in a foreigner-kind of way. I can't really distinguish between the qualities of Vietnamese food because I didn't grow up with it, but I enjoy the noodle bowls. My new favorite is the coconut milk curry bowl but watch out, it is spicy!"}
{"text":"Cheap eats, fast service!  I can dig.  Pho is my comfort food.  The Pho is alright, but I guess you get what you pay for.  For about $5 it's quick and yummy.  The portion size is just about right for an Asian dude like me...not too much but not too less.  Service was quick...ninja style! I just finished my water and it's full already right when I stuff my face full of noodles!  What's up with the lighting?  It's always so dark!  I'm scared!  Where's my Pho?  What am I eating, and where the hell is the bathroom?  - enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday evening for some pho tai. Was quickly greeted and seated and had my order taken. Got #2 spring rolls and #12 pho tai. Food was out scary quick and was good. Highly recommended and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I give it 3 1/2 stars... i really liked it, the egg rolls are good, love the mint leaves served with it and the dipping sauce.  And I dont even like egg rolls, so that's saying a lot.

i had a noodle dish with pork the first time.  It was ok... too many noodles, and kind of bland.

went back with my gf and son, I had another noodle dish, with rice noodles and beef, a bit spicy, just enough for flavor and the sauce was awesome.  i really like this dish. the noodles were the wide pad thai style rice noodles.  YUMMY!  

Morgan had the fried chicken... it was kinda greasy and not a lot of flavor, it also seemed like they fried it to death!  she \"didnt care for it.\"

Dom liked the egg rolls and picked at the chicken, he's a really good eater, so I think it just wasnt his cup of tea.  

I would go back, I just wouldnt put my family through that again!  :o)"}
{"text":"They were busy when we came in. It was around 2pm on Saturday, thinking most of lunch crowds will be gone but I was wrong. More than once I said, what does it take to get service here...

I was very hungry when I arrived for not having any food since breakfast. So here is my excuse for being impatient for slow service.

I ordered Thai Iced Tea, figured that will help me wait for a few minutes until my Pho was ready. It really did help and enjoyed sweet iced tea.

I ordered #10 for my soup. Very good pho, I ate very quickly and it was gone before any of my friends finished their lunch.

Since I was so hungry, I ordered two entree. Pork chop with shrimp took forever to come. I asked them to bring the pork dish after the pho but they underestimated how quickly I finished my soup. The dish was not what I thought it would taste but I ate them anyway.

Overall, this place may not be the cleanest not the best service but they do serve good pho. Most of the food is less than $7. I didn't think twice about ordering two entree for myself.

Whatever it was in their food, I had a plenty of energy after eating late lunch here. I hiked a mountain before lunch, I sprinted up another mountain after lunch.... So what was in their food gave me so much energy?"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to catch up with friends. It's affordable, tasty, and the service is friendly. It would be nice to see a few more vegetarian options on the menu. Until then, I usually customize a dish by adding tofu. For non-vegetarians, there's lots on the menu to try. If you don't like one item, I'm sure there's another selection that you might like.

My only complaint is that I'm not a fan of their payment system. The last time I visited I paid with cash. My money was returned (sans receipt), and I left cash behind for the tip. As I left, a server chased me out thinking that I dined and dashed. It was pretty embarrassing, so this might be an improvement that can be made."}
{"text":"I love the pho here.  1 of the best pho in the valley.  I always order number 10 and never been disappointed.  I will return."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The cua rang muoi (salt and pepper crab) is to die for and a must try.  The crab is fresh from the tanks in the back.

The Pho is not what I'm use to back in Colorado but this will do.

I love that I'm in and out relatively quickly when I want a quick bite for lunch."}
{"text":"Really Good Pho. 
Their sweet and sour chicken is better then any Chinese Rest. 
Kind of a hole in the wall, but never judge a book by it's cover!"}
{"text":"Most food taste not impressive but decent and many of the staff are actually very friendly and nice. The place is not clean and well organized but that is typical for Vietnamese places I have seen in the area. 

So why 2 star? Visited last week with friends and that was 2nd day in a row that week. This time I walked in with half finished Coke bottle in hand that I didn't want to waste by leaving it and got boiled in the car. After ordering food and drinks worth well over $100, I asked waitress for cup of ice for my half left bottle and she politely brought it to me. All nice so far.

Few minutes after, a lady, saying she is the manager,  came to me and told me she has to charge 50 cents for cup of ice since I brought the drink from outside. I was little miffed but said \"OK whatever. .\"  thinking I would just deduct that from tip I was gonna pay. The biggest problem was she would not go away and kept harassed me with sarcastic attitude and behavior. I had to ask her to leave table so that I can start on food. Funny thing was many waitresses came afterward to me and apologized for manager's behavior. They almost looked embarrassed by their manager's conduct.

To the owner of this restaurant, \"You need to lose your manager 'Loren'. She is like pest to your business and other friendly hard working staff. I know because I own 3 restaurants myself.\"

Food: 4
Facility: 2
Service: 4
Loren (manager): -1


There is my 2 star. ..."}
{"text":"I have only had the pho here and this place is good in comparison to the rest of the pho places around, but definitely not the best pho I've had because I moved here from LA.  One of my complaints about this place is that it inconsistent.  I've come here before and had great pho and then on other days I've come and the noodles were too soggy and I would get more of one meat than another in my soup.  Also, I think they overcook their tendon so it's a little too mushy for my liking.  The veggies that come on the side are often not fresh, with the jalapenos looking a little old and withered, and the waitresses are always a little off-putting when you ask them for extra sides.  If you want some authentic pho this is a good place to try, but I just don't think the quality is all there."}
{"text":"I have lived 2 blocks from this place for a year and have not tried it until a friend brought my boyfriend and I here for lunch about 2 weeks ago. We have been back 4 times since! The food is amazing, the service is fast and friendly and the prices are very low. So far we have ordered the #12 pho which is great, perfect flavor, comparable to LA pho. The spring rolls are very fresh, large and delicious. The beef and basil chow fun and spicy sate beef are also amazing dishes. Great flavor and good portions for the price. Also try the thai tea! Very refreshing and delicious! Every visit has been a positive experience.  I cannot wait to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant in AZ I have ever been. Very friendly staff, excellent taste, reasonable prices and quick service are what I see. 

Crispy chicken is awesome as well as lots of pho choices. 

The only thing I'd like to say for improvement is that the inside of the restaurant woud be redecorated and be more light."}
{"text":"This seemed to be a very authentic place. Spring rolls and egg rolls were very good. Pho was good. Teriyaki chicken was plain. If you don't go for the pho, don't go. If you like pho, you will love this place."}
{"text":"Has to be 5 stars as we return to this place every flipping weekend. This is in my opinion the best Vietnamese food you will get in the Phoenix area.

The staff are usually an absolute delight with their cute smiles and good manners. Unless they are busy and that all seems to change dramatically. It's no bother though because the food is ridiculously good.

So to start I go with the egg rolls and spring rolls. The sauce they have is a sort of Hoison with peanuts on it. If you want a kick to it then do what I do and mix a bit of siracha with it. AMAZING!

By this time the iced Vietnamese coffee will be out with it's sweet condensed milk which typically has me jumping for joy and swinging from the rafters with child like excitement.

For mains I always go with the Pho Tai with extra meat. I order extra meat as I never felt I got enough without it. So that maybe worth a note.

If you love Vietnamese food you 100% cannot be dissapointing with this spot. Always high on our list."}
{"text":"great food, good prices. Huge portions, amazing egg rools and spring rolls. i have been going here for 7 years and its never dissapointed me!"}
{"text":"I was here with a group of 10.  We got seated in one of the big tables near the back.  We were greeted by the server and asked for our drink orders.  I ordered the Thai Ice Tea.  It was good.  Each of us ordered our own dish.  I ordered the fried egg rolls, it was ok.  I ordered #32 BBQ pork, shredded pork, egg cake, and fish sauce.  Everything was just ok."}
{"text":"Recently \"rediscovered\" Saigon Pho.  It was a mainstay in our rotation back in the late 90s and early '00s. 
Not much has changed in the last 15 years. Same great value. Same great selections and even some of the same staff!  
Unfortunately their popularity hasn't changed either - long waits for a table at peak times are pretty common.  We usually hit it right after lunch time. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This probably might be the only favorite Pho spot I have ate at in Arizona so far.  I feel like there is definitely more to try on the menu for sure thats undiscovered by me quite yet but its just so hard to stray from the known and true.  I am not a fan of tendons tripe etc etc.  Keep it pretty simple with the strips of beef and meat balls. As well as the egg rolls number one or two on the menu I believe.  I also love how affordable they are and can always just hop skip and jump across the street when I am not feeling well to get some soup.  If you have not been...I urge you to go...NOW!"}
{"text":"I'm from California and only had pho back home. I read so many reviews about Saigon Pho and decided to give it a shot. BEST IDEA I EVER HAD. This is hands down one of my new favorite places to go. My boyfriend was a first timer having Pho and he fell in love. The food came out 5 minutes after ordering, and this was during dinner time. It was fairly busy. I suggest getting the lemonade (it is freshly made) 

I had the beef pho with beef ball. I believe it was the #11. AMAZING FLAVORRR. I also got the beef chow fun (PHENOMENAL) and the chicken with onion dish was very good as well. All reasonable prices too $6 a dish. My boyfriend is extremely picky and he is obsessed as much as I am. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING \"PHO\"..GO AND GET YOUR GRUB ON! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Love going to this place with the family. Usually order the house Pho and the house special fried rice. The pho broth is hearty and the oxtail is very tender. The house special fried rice is delicious and the Chinese sausage just adds that additional richness that you want with fried rice. Lastly, I normally get the Thai iced tea which tastes great and is really strong. I think the only downside is the fact that sometimes I do get thirsty after meals so I have a feeling MSG is used. Overall, good place for Pho. Now if only they could also make the lightning a bit brighter..."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and the service and quality of food has been declining and getting worse EVERY SINGLE TIME. Other members of my family have already stopped eating here a long time ago, however we still did because it's conveniently located right next to our house. The service has always been bad, rude servers. Ordering for pickup is always such a grueling task."}
{"text":"I haven't had service this bad in years. 

We waited 5 minutes to be seated. No biggie. 

We waited 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us and take our order. Okay, they were a little busy, we understand.

We waited 30 stinking minutes for our shrimp roll appetizers to come. Meanwhile we watched several other tables get seated, order, and receive the exact same spring rolls that we ordered. The rolls were good, but I wouldn't wait that long for them if I had known ahead of time.

We waited another 20-30 minutes for our pho. Seriously? What the pho? It doesn't take much to throw pho together. When we did receive the pho it was mediocre at best. It had a pretty good beefy flavor, but was too greasy. 

I love pho. I eat it often when I find a good place, but if this is the best that AZ has to offer, I'll eat something else."}
{"text":"The food is solid, but not awesome.  The room is kind of ugly and occasionally not too fragrant.

If you want Vietnamese, you want it dirt cheap and you want it now, this place gets it done.

If you want a warm, memorable dining experience, this is not the place."}
{"text":"This is consistently some of the best Vietnamese with great pho. The service is fast and you cant beat the price. The staff is genuinely friendly, providing excellent service. Go for the crispy duck...yum! Not fancy, but really, really good."}
{"text":"The pho is  delicious. I get the meatball pho with oxtail and the broth is amazing. Also the fried rice is  another favorite. I highly recommend to try this place and they also have fresh crab."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my stylist @Strut Salon. It dominates a corner of the plaza. Part of it seemed to be shut down, like they resized it and made it smaller. But what do I know? This might be an unfair review as I was ravenous, but it was delicious. (Took it to go). The waitress was super cute she came over and said the other lady really liked my hair and pretty soon all 3 were around me(think they were shy, or I looked hangry), and stood there giggling and chatting me up about my hair. Super nice since I literally just got it done. Pretty cool. But more to the point the food was yum, the shrimp was ah-mazing! I will be back.
Took my best friend ~ well ok she took me. The food was just as delicious. Off to a rocky start with waitress, but she eventually warmed up to us. A meal for 3 was about 25.00. Savory and well worth is!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months and although I've been able to try some other pho spots close by, for value, quality, and customer service, Saigon Pho wins in my book. Seems like maybe the month I downgraded them perhaps was a fluke (hopefully), because our food was excellent tonight. Fresh. And the customer service is always great here. Love this place and I'm here to stay!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here about a week ago after we read great reviews. After our experience here in appalled that they are give great reviews on their food. I ordered Pho and it was flavorless. Think about eating spaghetti in colored water. I had to pack on the fish sauce, sriracha, and oyster sauce and I'm not one who loves a lot of flavors. My husband ordered the lemongrass chicken, which was burnt and didn't taste anything like it. It was disappointing after reading so much great reviews."}
{"text":"Saigon Pho has some of the best Vietnamese food I have ever had. 

Their lemon grass chicken is spicy, but oh so good. Their Thai iced tea is not watered down like other places. 

The staff here is quick on the order, patient, and super friendly."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for many years now (over 5 years) since I moved to Chandler. I come here atleast, if not more, once a week. I love their quickness of service and the food comes out fast too. Even on their busiest days (Fridays & Saturday evenings), the service is always great. Oh and not to forget, the food tastes great too! Always consistent."}
{"text":"Pho is my favorite and this place does it well! The spring rolls are amazing! I love that you get the Carrot infused fish sauce to dip the hot crunchy rolls in! Amazing! And getting a vat of soup is nothing to complain about either! I always get the #1 and the #12. The #12 is the Fresh Slices Beef Pho, through some jalapenos and lime juice in there and eat up! Mm Mm Mmmm!!"}
{"text":"I've been to like 2 Vietnamese restaurants in my life, so I'm not an expert and can't compare this to anything else.  But I really liked the food and the flavors of this food.  I could see the menu being a little overwhelming but I asked some people who'd been before and checked the other Yelp reviews and decided on the following:

Beef Chow Fun - Yum.  Greasy but excellent dish.  Kind of reminded me of Mongolian beef over noodles.   Fun indeed.

Spicy Beef w/ Rice Noodles - Probably my favorite of the soups I tried.  This had a little bit more going on that just broth and noodles.  Good enough that at some point, I will crave a bowl and be back for it.

Freshly Sliced Beef Pho - This was what I expected.  A kind of nicely flavored beef broth soup.  A little bland for me, but my kids LOVED it.

Pork Bun (pork and egg rolls on cold vermicelli noodles) - I was most surprised by this one.  Cold noodles and fish sauce makes me say \"meh,\" but I really liked this dish.  Fish sauce and all.  Actually the sauce probably made the dish.

As everyone else has said, the places is pretty cheap.  Unlike everyone else... you can keep the darn spring rolls.  Egg roll... awesome.  Cold transparently wrapped bunches of tasteless lettuce... not so much."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a while, too far, but, tonight decided to make the drive.

This is an extremely comfortable place to eat, the booths and the lighting have been redone since my last visit.

The quality of the food and the service are both really great here.  The house crispy chicken and the Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce are my favorites.  The others had beef chow fun and pho 19.  The spring rolls here are somehow better than all the other spots with what seems to be the SAME ingredients.  

Laurie still remembered us and what we  like after almost a year.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is quite seriously the best Vietnamese restaurant ever.  My family has been here on countless occasions, and I'm happy to say that the quality and consistency are there.  

The eggrolls are to die for -- they're stuffed with steaming filling, covered in a crispily fried skin, and you wrap them in lettuce and dip them in this sweet-sour carrot concoction that is so delicious that it makes you swoon and omg my mouth is watering right now.  

The pho is perfect.  Best pho I've ever had -- flavorful broth and tender beef that melts on your tongue with the pho noodles that absorb the complexity of the soup.  Their egg noodles are also delicious, rich, and it reminds me of the noodle bowls that I get whenever I visit my family in Taiwan.

The lemon grass chicken is superb.  I always ask for them to add in more heat, and they always deliver because I'm sweating and crying as I eat it, but I just can't stop.  Beef and basil is also amazing -- slightly floral with juice slices of beef that compliments their fluffily steamed rice so well.

I could go on and on about this place.  The prices are also wonderful; my wallet is a fan just as much as I am."}
{"text":"This has been bookmarked for a while because I am on a hot search for the BEST PHO in PHOenix. I was finally on the Chandler side of life over the weekend, so I excitedly stopped into Saigon Pho to get a take out order of Veggie Pho.

The place was PACKED when I arrived, which I took as a great sign. I literally had to carefully pick my way through the packed tables to get to the back of the restaurant to place an order.

I was never greeted or acknowledged, but stood there awkwardly for a few minutes until I finally stopped someone and asked if I could place an order to go. I ordered vegetable pho and waited.

I waited by the scary lobster tank in the back that I am positive Chef Ramsay would find appalling. I know it made me queasy quite a few times.

I was not given any utensils with my to go order, so again I had to wait another awkward few minutes to finally flag someone down to get chopsticks (seriously, who can eat pho without chopsticks, am I right?)

When I arrived home with my long awaited taste of pho...I was disappointed. It was 80% broth, 10 % noodles, 5% vegetables (literally 4 pieces of broccoli and two slices of carrot) and 5% sprouts, onions,basil.  I was still hungry after I finished all five bites of my meal and had to scrounge around my house to find something else to eat.

Will not be back, but glad I can say I tried another place...the search for the best PHO in the valley is still on!"}
{"text":"My first visit was on October 27, 2012; I came in with a large group and it was my first experience with Vietnamese food. Props to the round spinning table! For a drink I ordered cà phê ?á and was it real coffee! I wanted to order one of the Pho soup bowls however, I went for something lighter, rice noodles with tofu. Whatever sauce they use, it really brought the taste of the noodles and the tofu together. Next time I will order Pho, like the other group members ordered. (I recommend first time visitors try the dessert)."}
{"text":"I just moved here from California last week, and I was craving Vietnamese food REAL BAD.  I jumped on yelp, and found Saigon Pho.  We did takeout, and the food was pretty good.  Our order consisted of Cha Gio (Fried Eggrolls), Bun Cha Gio (Fried Eggrolls atop cold rice vermicelli with lettuce, cucumbers, sprouts and nuoc cham sauce) and Beef Chow fun (Beef with wide rice noodles, stir fried).  Everything was delicious, and our order came in under $20.   I will definitely be back...."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a busy weekend night. Was seated pretty fast. Basic establishment, no updates and such. Our table ordered a few different menu items. 
Teriyaki chicken, fried rice, white rice, beef pho, chicken pho, and a mixed veggie stir fry plate. 
Enjoyed everything we ordered! We had 3 toddlers with us and since the atmosphere was loud, we weren't an annoyance."}
{"text":"Service was fast and the ladies that work there are friendly. Food is tasty and cheap  I would come back here again"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat pho! The prices are so affordable. I would eat here every week!"}
{"text":"Having never delved into the fabulous world of pho before, and finding myself a bit under the weather, I was instructed by a friend (who I now consider very wise) to head over to Saigon Pho and grab some pho.  Since my initial visit, Saigon Pho has introduced me to the brothy wonders of Vietnamese soup.  I regularly call in to order for pick up, and it's always ready within 15-20 minutes.  The broth and meat of choice (to go) comes in a huge styrofoam (Argh!  But what can you do?) cup and all of the fixins - basil, sprouts, rice noodles, lime, sauces, jalepeños - come in a separate box so you can mix to your liking.  

Basically, if you're having a low-key movie night at home and don't want to cook, but don't want to stuff your face with fatty foods, you'll want to order something from here (I recommend the chicken or beef pho) on your way home.  And don't forget the spring rolls...they are unique in flavor and texture despite being made with the standard ingredients.  I'm not sure what it is, but it almost tastes like they brush the wrapper with almond extract, really delicious!  

While I'm still exploring my pho options, this place is so conveniently close to my house, I won't feel bad using it as a fall back if I ever find somewhere better."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Pho restaurant in town.  This is a guilt free place to eat.  There are so many light, fresh, low fat, low everything but good stuff dishes here, you can't go wrong.

The selection is good... you can get different BBQ meats, shrimp or meatballs in different combinations over noodles in at least 3 different styles of soups.  They also have dishes that are not soups served over rice or different kinds of noodles.

In addition to the soups and entrees, there is a full selection of appetizers.  My favorite are the spring rolls.... fresh crispy veggies and greens with all the sauces and extras. YUM!

They also have Boba drinks.  I thought Boba was Japanese. I guess it is Vietnamese as well.

The price can't be beat.  An entree is around $5."}
{"text":"When you gaze upon it the aesthetic of the piece has a simplistic almost minimalistic feel to it. But on second glance, you realize the work of art is a masterpiece. It has tons of details with eye catching colors. The lines flow so fluidity. Some may say the work could have come from the pre-Raphaelite era while others argue it could be comparable to postmodernism. However when the piece is placed juxtaposed with a similar piece it is easy to see the differences. It doesn't end there with the visual appeal but it arouses the other senses invoking emotional reactions to it. For me i felt the warmth and comfort which followed but the tingling of my taste and nerves. Yes i am talking about Saigon's pho. It is a masterpiece, a work of art."}
{"text":"The four stars is definitely for the Vietnamese Pho! They have several types with the curry base as well and all I really good.

The Thai iced tea is also excellent.

However the other food we ordered wasn't so tasty. The best thing by far are the soups.

So overall it's great food at a great price. So that's why give it four stars. I almost gave it three stars but I remembered how good the soup was :)"}
{"text":"I've been 4 times, my sister was pregnant and the baby needed that Pho--Lucky me!

Best Pho, ever.  

Best spring rolls and the egg roll is served the right way--with lettuce to wrap around.  Also, fresh oil--not oil that's been around for 100 years--you know what i mean... *fresh*

Huge, generous portions, fresh and authentic.  Gracious and hospitable service and the prices are insanely low.

So good that I'll drive to Chandler from South Scottsdale just for a taste.

Go.  Now.

-*- After reading a couple of reviews, I have to request that anyone please *not* dine here if you can't handle Vietnamese people eating next to you--I would hate for your bigotry to ruin the experience for anyone else.  In fact, you should probably not dine anywhere outside of your home if you're so consumed with hatred for anyone of a different ethnicity.  Thanks, much appreciated!  =) -*-"}
{"text":"Went in a group of 11. Great round table for all of us to sit. Food was enjoyable and decent quality. Prices are very cheap for what you get. Would recommend."}
{"text":"My favorite pho place!

I love coming here to study and have a good quick bowl of pho. Their portions are great and their prices are the best. Service is great as well -- every time I go I overhear the servers all chummy with their tables, so clearly they have many regulars, and I am definitely one of them now!

I love their string beans with ground pork as well, a big whole plate of them for just $5.95. 

One odd thing though, for the past couple of months, they have not had jalapenos to serve with the pho. Instead, they use little thai chilis. Not sure why they stopped using jalapenos but in the off-chance they read these reviews, please start buying jalapenos again!! lol"}
{"text":"Have you people not gone to a good pho place?  Hands down the worst vermicelli dish I ever had and my friend wasn't fond of his pho. The egg roll tasted of mushy grease, the pork lacked flavor. The rice paper for the spring roll was still dehydrated and crunchy in spots.  I'm not from Arizona so I'm not sure if this is the best your state has to offer, which is indicated from the rest of the reviews. I feel sorry and sad."}
{"text":"Unusual for a Vietnamese restaurant, I hold this place to the same standard of cleanliness I expect from a Chinese restaurant: if it tastes good and doesn't make me sick, it's a-okay! I have grown up in Asian restaurants and really, despite all the negative reviews, this place isn't that scary! If you're looking for ambiance, well, maybe you should save this one for another day. I can't say I've ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant where the decorations blew me away. However, if you are craving some mighty decent Vietnamese cuisine, you have arrived at your destination.

I grew up on Oahu where Pho places are like McDonalds- they are practically on every corner. It being one of my favorite foods, I've been to a great many restaurants for pho, and have tried to find a place that can fill that big beef noodle soup void in my heart..( or stomach.. same thing) since moving to Arizona. I've come to the conclusion that there is nothing in Tucson. Chandler, however, is fortunate enough to have this little gem.

The bowls are large and very affordable.  The easiest difference to distinguish between pho places is the broth. Saigon has a pretty good broth, and offers almost all the right condiments. The only thing this place is missing is sate, which is like chili oil with garlic or shallots, and culantro. If only I could figure out what it's called in Vietnamese... Large in size with sharp edges, it is similar to cilantro but more subtle and slightly sweet. These, while a major drawback for me, are minor for the overall quality found here at Saigon. The beauty of pho is that it arrives light and fairly simple. Its up to you to customize your own bowl to your individual taste. 

The spring rolls are good, served properly dressed with lettuce leaves and mint for wrapping with traditional sweet sour fish sauce for dipping. If you like coffee, you haven't lived until you have had a Vietnamese iced coffee. No. Seriously.

And a small but hugely fantastic thing? They have fresh coconuts that you can order to drink the juice out of! And eat the coconut flesh after of course.. Mmmm

So while this isn't the best pho I've ever had in my life, it IS the best I've had in Arizona so far."}
{"text":"Anything you get here is good, trust me! And they have very good prices... Can't beat that!  My personal fav's:
#10 w/no meatballs
#25 
#41 (i think) crispy noodles
Salt & pepper squid w/rice"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, no ambiance, hole in the wall VN place.  We go there all the time.  Pho is good and cheap."}
{"text":"This place is a lot bigger inside than it looks like from the outside.  That was kind of startling.  The food is good and I look forward to going back.  I think my ordering could have been better but what I got was enjoyable.  The service is spotty and we had to wave down our waiter whenever something was needed. The kitchen was able to turn out our order quickly though.  Everything on the menu is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great dishes,  Try the Beef salad,  similar to Tai Beef salad but not that spicy.  Pho is great,  Bun is great,  Great seafood.  It's all good.  Never had a bad dish here.  Friend got vegetarian and he said it was good.  Recommend for casual tasty meal.  Really inexpensive.  You could eat for under $10 but I can't pass up the Goi Cuon, and salads."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Pho in the valley and it's so inexpensive. Great service and great Thai Ice Tea!"}
{"text":"The food and value at Saigon, bar none is a 10 for me.  I love the sliced beef pho #12 which I must order with an order of spring rolls.  The soup is always hot and fast with fresh sprouts, lime, and basil.  As for the spring rolls, well I have an addiction to these fried egg rolls wrapped in romaine lettuce and mint.  On occasion I will splurge and order a fresh drip ice coffee--a nice finish to a good meal.  

The service is swift and mildly courteous which is fine by me only because the food is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, yes please.  When you find a good Vietnamese place it just beckons you back time and again.  I've been here four times over the past year, and each time has been wonderful.  When the local Vietnamese place packs a restaurant to the gills like this one does on the weekends, you know they either have a large kinship network or amazing food.  I vote for the latter.  I have had:

*Beef spring rolls (not on the menu, just ask).  Grilled beef with the sprouts and such in a paper wrap.  MMM.  Other basic rolls (both fresh and fried) are tops.
*Spicy Fish pho.  Melt in your mouth fish swimming in subtle chicken-based broth with greens...MMMM....
*Lemon Grass chicken - lots o' lemongrass flavor, perfectly char grilled chix, spices, MMMM...
*Fried fish - there are a few options on the first page of the menu, meant for family style sharing, but PERFECTLY FRIED in a light, almost beer batter crust.  The best fried fish I've had in a long while...

When in the area it is a DESTINATION.  And since they're open all day, one doesn't even have to plan!!  Yay,  I am a fan."}
{"text":"Saigon is by far my favorite pho stop. I come here every time I'm back home in Phoenix or when I am craving some hot soupy noodles. 

I almost always order the same thing when I come here: the spring rolls, a pho tai (#12), and a combination 3 bean drink. The spring rolls are perfectly crispy and go very well wrapped in the big lettuce leaves they come with and dipped in the fish sauce on the side. The meat in the pho comes in very thin slices that finish cooking in your soup at the table - yum! (I love adding sriracha and hoisin sauce to my bowl as well for added spice and flavor) The bean drink is cold and refreshing, and a sweet addition to the meal. 

I would recommend Saigon to any pho lover or anyone looking for warm soup on a sick day. The pho is authentic and delicious, as well as the other dishes that I've tried here!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. If you like pho #12 is my personal favorite. Oh and the spring rolls so amazing ... Fried tofu is on point the sauce with it is to die for legitimately. String beans with pork is great. Really I haven't had anything I don't like here 

They can get super busy here but worth the wait. This is my favorite pho place around"}
{"text":"Food was alright. Not the best pho, in my opinion - though not the worst I've had. I'd definitely recommend Pho Van that's just down the road from it (on corner of Dobson and Warner) instead. MUCH better pho. The rest of the food was good - according to the rest of our party. I didn't pay so I can't comment on prices, though from what I saw, it was reasonably priced for the portions that you get.

Our waitress was INCREDIBLY rude. And the service was extremely slow. Both of which means I will not return.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"YUM

Love this place!!! Pho is FANTASTIC! EGG ROLLS ARE THE BEST! Can't say enough good things about Saigon Pho.. Just go there! NOW......."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been, every plate is awesome... Best Pho!! I come to this restaurant at least twice at month ... 30 miles drive from were I live to get there all worth it !!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this was definitely the best place to eat Pho. The broth was so flavorful, rice noodles were perfectly cooked, huge portions, very fresh, and huge selection of what your protein preferences are. 

The Thai tea and iced tea were so amazing. The appetizers we had were the shrimp spring rolls and fried egg rolls. Both were fresh and the dipping sauces perfectly matched each roll enhancing all the flavors in each roll. 

To top our dining experience off, the servers were just awesome. All of these ladies were sweet and attentive to anything we needed. We were made to feel so welcome by everyone. 

Fantastic service, delectable drink/food, and a clean well maintained restaurant. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"They have excellent food at a great price! I usually get a 43 (Beef and Basil Chow Fun) and another dish to go with it. It will last me 2 meals and usually for around $15.   I usually get to-go and it is very fast and a quick in and out. However, when eating in the service is not great. They are ALWAYS busy no matter the day or time, so it's hard to get good service, but once your order is taken it's not a super long wait, the wait is to get your order taken. Other than that, refilling water/drinks is sub-par, usually have to ask for it. However, the great food and prices make up for what the service lacks."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and great value that is served crazy fast. The pho is the best in town but underrated is the won ton. The salt and pepper squid is an order of magnitude better than any calamari app served at any trendy Scottsdale Asian fusion restaurant for half the price. Been going for years now, will continue to."}
{"text":"Was there tonight and the food is still amazing since the beginning in the 90s they know me #17 extra peanuts"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good here over the years.  Service isn't always so great and though this sounds bad, I just don't expect good service at any Asian places that really cater to real Asians.

Our large extended family sometimes comes here and gets 2 large tables and just chows down.  Everything is really good.  I really love the Beef Pho, their spring rolls, their eggrolls.  I can't think of all the things we've eaten here, but it's all good if you can stand subpar service.  If the service were more like at a Caucasian restaurant, I would give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Everything was very good here. We had a combo of pho, fresh rolls, and rice plates and it was all so good. Finally, I have found a place near mesa that I would come back to. Being from Seattle, it's hard to find good Asian good in this area!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times a couple of years ago, back when I used to live in Chandler.  This is a place that many Vietnamese refer me to when I ask about Pho (nail artists and coworkers alike).  But this was before all the new pho places have popped up!  

I've never been crazy about pho, and I can't recall if I've tried it here.  I have tried a few apps and stir-fries, and I have to say that none have been worth writing home about (or more appropriately, none are worth YELPING about).  The outdated/old-fashioned decor doesn't help, either.  I'd say the only positive thing Saigon Pho has going, at least for me, is the server Crystal.  Very friendly, efficient, and she always has suggestions ready based on what you feel like having."}
{"text":"Some things never change... and for Saigon Pho and their customers, that's a Good Thing!

The first day in the Phoenix area... more specifically, Chandler, brought me the ONLY Vietnamese Pho place I have ever frequented in Arizona... really, I have yet to try another Vietnamese Pho restaurant in this state!

And... without a glance at my previous reviews... I virtually ordered the exact  same combination of entrees...

Chicken Rice Soup #51 (***** $4.95... increase of $0.50) After two years, there only has been an increase of just fifty cents for this Rice Porridge Soup.... JUST FIFTY CENTS! I have no doubt other Yelpers have noticed portion reductons and / or price increases in their favorite restaurants. In just two years an increase this infinitesimal is a bargain!

You'll receive your Porridge, which is just boiled Rice to a glutinous consistency, in a 6-inch wide bowl, with the addition of pulled Chicken meat, fermented Turnips, bits of Ginger, and Green Onions. A very simple Soup, don't you think?

Along with either Porridge or Pho, I also order...

Beef Chow Fun #39 (***** $6.50-no change in price) A very, very affordable Chow Fun... as inexpensive as you'll find anywhere!

Stir-Fried wide Rice Noodles with marinated strips of Beef,  Bean Sprouts, Yellow Onions, Green Onions in a Sweet Soy Sauce! Delicioso!

My friend, whom I visited on this trip... even though he is Chinese, never had Chow Fun of any kind in his life... stated this is one of the best Chinese entrees he ever had! I had to remind him that this IS a Vietnamese place... and Chinese would never make SWEET Chow Fun, even though it was VERY, Very good.


I, initially, wanted an order of Oysters in Black Bean Sauce..  but the waitress stated the restaurant stopped serving Oysters because customers started returning the entree... Saigon Pho, the last time I ordered it in  Black Bean Sauce, then had the LARGEST Oysters I had seen short of seeing it served in a coastal city like San Francisco. The Oysters can be very intimidating... they're HUGE! I kid you not, if you special order it now... you would think the Oysters were aided in their growth by artificial means. If my stay in Arizona were longer... I would not hesitate in ordering this. But I had to resort to....

Clams with Basil Leaf (**** 1/2 Market Price) A HUGE order of Clams cooked with Basil, in a sweet Soy Sauce concoction! The PILE of Clams musta been over four inches high!

Saigon Beef Rice Noodle Soup (Not Rated $5.95) My friend's order...
 
Ice Coffee with Condensed Milk #54 (***** $2.50) WAAAYYY better than that Italian stuff... Way, WAY BETTER!
   
... And you get to percolate it yourself at the table... if you want to, that is. This is one of the very few Vietnamese restaurants that will let you \"do it yourself\", as most restaurants want to \"turn\" your table as fast as possible.

   Some views of the Viet Coffee dripping, and dripping, and dripping...

      ( http://s3-media2.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VNQLgijYek1UNPAhiBNc3A/l.jpg  )

Total: $33.12 (including tax & including my friend's Pho order)


My server was a young woman, whom I have got to know since she was working here as a high school teen. On my last visit a couple of years ago, she just graduated with a degree in Business Administration from ASU. She was very enthusiastic and positive about her future... and was thinking about opening up her own Asian restaurant or taking advantage of her degree and attaining a position in a big corporation... or even marriage! I was very surprised to see her still here.

All in all, still a very popular destination among residents in Chandler... about 80% of capacity at 8pm."}
{"text":"You walk in, and it smells just like Lee-Lee Market. There is outdated furniture and decor.  There is a constant Din of Vietnamese being spoken in the back and front of house. The menu is covered in things that you cannot pronounce and quite frankly have no idea what they are.  There is something called \"Squid Sauce\" on the table.  This place has got to kick some serious ass right? NO! No. It does not have to. 

Enough already. Just Stop it.  Just because some place has a weird vibe and seams out of this world does not mean that it is amazing or even good. It means that you should give it a fair shake just like everything else.  When you look past the glamor of being unglamorous you soon realize that this place is mediocre at best.

I had the Chicken in Lemon Grass sauce and you know what? It was edible.  And I ate it.   I also had the Thai Iced tea and I drank it as well. But that was it. Nothing more and nothing less.  I  know when something tastes good and I refuse to chalk this one up to being an unsophisticated dolt (In reality, I am am exactly that, but my tongue and tummy do not know me very well. So let's keep this between us).

I have done it a thousand times before.  \"Well, this place is really foreign and weird, so let's go there and be hip!\" Well today I draw a line in the sand and make a stand.  

Here is the beginning of my food manifesto!
1.Good food is universal. If something does not taste good, it does not taste good.

 And...Hmm...Well... That got off to a good start and then lost steam after my first demand.  Well, Ted Kaczynski I am not."}
{"text":"So this is the 3rd Vietnamese restaurant I've tried in AZ. I guess 3rd time is a charm. Pretty close to what I'm used to in San Diego but still San Diego has the best PHO, spring rolls and Vietnamese coffee ever! They were really friendly and attentive . Good size pho , spring rolls were good but portion too small. Vietnamese coffee was not bad. Prices were good not over priced like all the other places in AZ."}
{"text":"If you can get over the horrible smell, the food wasn't awful. Not my favorite, but not the worst either. The food came out really quick during the lunch rush. Service wasn't anything special, your typical dry service. We had to ask for our pho sides and spoons, but she was pretty busy.  I think the pho was missing depth, my husband liked it after adding a load of other ingredients and chili paste. The pork bun was good, but was skimpy on the pork.  I haven't thus far met a pork bun I didn't like though. I just couldn't get over the smell. I thought it smelled of moth balls, but my husband said it smelled like a pet store. It instantly turned my stomach."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! I moved from Southern California 2 years ago and haven't been able to find an amazing pho place until now. I can gladly say I will be going back! The staff is really friendly and my pho was ready to go in about 10 minutes. Seriously, I'm so glad I found this place."}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese foods. However, the water always taste like breached water. The best noodle soup and fry pork rice dish around that area. Very good price for lunch, especially for people work cross street at Intel. It's crowed over weekend. 

One thing to keep in mind when paying the bill. Double check the total price after tax. They sometimes add extra couple dollars if you don't pay attention."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon is a great place to satisfy my craving for greasy and comforting beef chow fun and my personal favorite: deep fried tofu. I order these two dishes everytime.

The fried chicken is nice and crispy, but the meat is a little on the dry side. The beef satay is good and flavorful, but a bit too salty. 

I don't recommend the pho here as the broth tastes like a hybrid between pho, and broth for won ton soup. It's overly sweet and does not have enough flavor. 

Good service and food comes out fast."}
{"text":"Eh, it was fine. Pretty much your XYZ-Vietnamese restaurant. The meat in their pho was sparse- there was an extremely skewed meat-tendon ratio. The tendon was quite good, but there just wasn't enough meat to balance it out. I had a brown lemonade which was fine, but didn't make up for the fact that they don't have salty-plum-soda on their menu.

Their menu has a bit of diversity to it, but I just wasn't hugely impressed. Their chicken teriyaki was alright, their goi cuon was alright, and their pho was just sort of... there. Plus, the waitress seemed genuinely surprised that a white guy would order pho... and that always annoys me."}
{"text":"best Pho ever! We drove from down town tempe to eat here. you can't go wrong. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Always clean. Always delicious. Reasonably priced. Very polite and efficient service.
Once a week take out from this place."}
{"text":"the Pho bo vien is sooo sooo yummy and the spring roll are so die for. great prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving pho last weekend and after an unfortunate experience at another vietnamese restaurant we ended up here. I'm so glad we did! The service was quick and very friendly and the pho was the best I've had in a long time! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu has been a must eat so far! Love their curry chicken and fish with Saigon special sauce. Spicy basil chicken and teriyaki chicken is good too. A must go place if you are in Chandler."}
{"text":"This place is dirty I feel like my food was recycled.  The service was bad. I asked for a lot of lemons they gave me two slices(dry slices) I had to clean my chopsticks and spoons."}
{"text":"Food and service was quick and good, but the restaurant is a bit dirty. The table I was seated at was sticky and the bathrooms are quite messy. 

There was no problem with the food, but I'd much rather go to Chandler Pho or AZ Pho and Grill. They are much cleaner and the waiters/waitresses are very friendly."}
{"text":"Saigon Pho Falls Flat

Years ago, my husband and i went to Saigon Pho regularly before choir practice to get a bowl of Bun Hanoi.  Once we quit the choir, and found Cyclo, Saigon Pho was no longer on the radar screen.  Last night, i craved a bowl of pho, and wanting to mix it up a bit, we thought we'd visit the old haunt.

Well, disappointing.  The Pho Tai was flat in flavor, greasy and very, very average.  the \"salad\" consisted of a handful of bean sprouts, a lemon wedge, one basil leaf (!) and a sickly branch of couple day old mint leaves.  

It was sustenance, but not a great food treat.  

we'll be moving on."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  The prices are great, the service is fast, and the food is amazing! They are wonderful to our kids every time. We'll drive here from East Mesa for the best pho in the Valley."}
{"text":"I judge every Pho restaurant by their Pho Tai. Saigon doesn't disappoint.

When you walk in, you will be seated immediately. Staff is courteous and quick. My water was always filled without me asking. Check came just as I finished my meal.

You can tell that the broth was cooking for a long time. Very complex flavors, not overly salty but well seasoned. The meat tasted of higher quality.

Best part about this place is the price is right. Many pho places charge $8+ per bowl but you can get a bowl here for like $5 and change. I've been here roughly a dozen times and always enjoy introducing this place to new people."}
{"text":"Consistently good solid food! This place is always hopping fast fresh and reasonably priced. Love having it set close I am a regular here. #25 is my go to standard. Try it you will like it!"}
{"text":"Service is FAST and efficient. Beff Pho was tasty, but I wish they offered the shrimp AND pork spring rolls. I opted for the deep fried egg rolls and they were much like you would find anywhere else. They came out so fast (and temperature wise) I suspect they were pre-cooked. Still overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Good food makes you happy.  Some restautants have that kind of food.  This one does.  Egg rolls were good.  The egg noodle and duck soup was super.  The best thing was the spicy lemon grass chicken.  Great flavor.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Plain decor, which to me is always a good sign.  The best vietnamese food I have had here so far."}
{"text":"It's been 3 years since I've been going here I've been to every pho place possible, this place kills it with Portion,freshness,service, and my favorite...PRICE!!"}
{"text":"Saigon Pho is by far my favorite Vietnamese restaurant I have ever eaten at.  I have tried egg rolls all over the world, but there is something about Saigon that just leaves the competition in the dust.  My favorite dish is the #17, followed up by the #43.  If you are looking for traditional, go straight for the #12.  You will not be disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town.  Their rolls with rice paper (2 and 3) are fresh, well sized, and priced right.  The beef Pho (12) and chicken Pho (14) are amazing.  

You will find the service to be quick and on top of things.  

Also, their take out is great.  

I'd give them 6 stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese food in Chandler...tremendous Seafood Pho; Seafood Rice Soup is pretty amazing as well.  Huge portions and amazingly reasonable prices...go for the food it's great...tolerate the incredibly average strip mall setting..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were on a hunt for good pho in AZ, as California natives we are a bit picky.  Our taste buds were searching for the home taste we miss so dearly.  Finally we found Saigon Pho! We got the saigon special and regular pho tai.  The broth was very clear and the meats were not too tough.  I'm comparing this to UnPHOgettable, seems that place had a lot of good reviews but we aren't fans.  We also got the porkchop rice plate, the porkchop was very moist and not dry.  Service is kind of slow but its a HUGE place! My favorite was they give you oxtail in the saigon special which a lot of places don't."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The staff definitely makes you feel like family! My favorite go to is the #11 and their fresh lemonade. A must try if you are looking for delicious pho."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this evening, my wife has raved about it for a long time. Came in around 7pm, instantly greeted by the staff. Sat in a booth and we decided to get 3 things.

Of course, we got a bowl of Pho, beef sliced pho. Best broth I've had. I've been to other Vietnamese restaurants where the broth had too much oil, not here! Saigon Pho & Seafood's broth was perfect. Noodles were fresh, so were the vegetables, beef was fresh too, tender.

We also go the salt and pepper calamari. This is the best calamari I've had to date. We demolished the plate. If you like calamari, don't skip out on this dish if you visit Saigon Pho, it's the bomb.

We were hungry so we got another dish, spicy basil chicken. All white meat, amazing sauce, it was good.

All 3 dishes came to $29 bucks! Reasonable.

We were thanked a few times for coming in as we left the restaurant.

I can see why my wife comes here all the time, I'll for sure be back."}
{"text":"I had congee and it was a bit mediocre to me. I would come back just to get a quick meal, but not really spend much time because the service was ehh too."}
{"text":"First time here was great and since then service quality and cleanliness has continue to lack . Dirty Tables , dirty cups a couple and inconsistent portions and quality. Had 4 people waiting on us so it was a joke they thought they where quicker but it caused confusion. Taste also changes from the few times we have been in. Chicken and rice this time taste like mush and chicken. Really like this place but the Pho at times is mixing ingredients and we have to ask or send back .. not what I like when paying to eat out"}
{"text":"I am a huge pho fan, so I have tried a lot of pho places. I have been coming to this place since I was little with my family almost every Sunday. Having said that, I just came back to Saigon a few days ago for the first time in a long time. The pho is still good, but the broth was too salty. I got the number 12- sliced beef and meat balls, I personally was not the biggest fan of the texture of the sliced beef, but my sister liked it. 
I also got the the chargrilled beef and shrimp with fishcake over rice. This was significantly better than the pho. The beef and shrimp was grilled nicely and the beef was the perfect amount of savory and sweet."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant , pretty decent friendly staff the food came out pretty fast
We ordered the Thai iced coffee. My brother in law who lives here had never had it before and he was impressed.  Ya gotta try it if you never had it before. I always order it in Honolulu. My wife and I ordered the combination pho. For the price it was decent. Honolulu restaurants have more meat and tripe, but again it cost $3 more there.
We also ordered the steamed flounder prepared Chinese style with ginger green onions and oil and shoyu.  For the price it was great $18.
My guests who had the vermicelli had to put sauce on to make it moist.  It wasn't semi moist like it should.  Maybe the noodles were prepared hours before and been sitting. Ask for extra sauce for that #25.
Clean busy 
Would go back again."}
{"text":"This is my absolute FAVORITE place for pho in the Valley. I only get out here every so often, and always make a point to come here to eat whenever I know I'm going to be in the east valley. I have not had a bad meal or experience yet. This place is legit. Can get really busy, and you may have to wait on a Sunday afternoon but who cares. The food is excellent. The beef noodle soup is so good. The broth is so satisfying; but my all time favorite is the coconut curry chicken rice noodle soup. It is rich, but the combination of the curry and coconut milk is fantastic. Next time I will ask if they can do it in beef (stole some of my wife's rare beef and it was so good in this soup), but if not, I don't care; it's that good. The iced coffee is good to if you want a nice strong but sweet treat. Check this place out."}
{"text":"I'm not terribly familiar with Vietnamese cuisine so consider this review from a slightly undereducated palate when it comes to the cuisine.  My oldest daughter and I decided on Saigon Pho because we were in the mood for something different.  

I was not impressed with the atmosphere here.  It was pretty run-down looking.  But I'll overlook that if the prices are good and the food is enjoyable.  They seem to operate with server by committee here, with any of 3-4 different women checking on us every 3-4 minutes.  One of them has personal space issues.  Her first stop at the table she placed both palms on the table, leaned way too far in, flashed a disconcertingly toothy smile and said \"Hi\" loudly through aforementioned smile.  My first inclination was to lean away as she might go Mike Tyson on my ear or something.

We ordered an appetizer of Vietnamese shrimp and vegetable rolls.  They were served with a dish of hoison sauce for dipping.  The rolls were large and filled with lettuce, vermicelli noodles, bean sprouts, 2 shrimp sliced lengthwise and a couple mint leaves.  This all combined to produce an interesting flavor combination but they were unremarkable overall.

We also shared seafood rice soup which was served in a large portion.  I'm pretty sure the rice had been blended and it was very small bits and the overall consistency was similar to runny grits.    It had a distinct hint of ginger.  There were a couple shrimp, several bites of squid and several bites of crab.  I'm not positive it was crab.  At first I thought it was \"Krab\" but I wasn't completely sure.   They do have tanks here with live crab and lobster so you would hope they are not going the \"krab\" route.

Lastly we shared a chicken teriyaki over rice.  The chicken was a little overdone but had a nice roasted flavor.  The teriyaki had the requisite sweetness that always works for the kids and thankfully they did not bludgeon the dish with excess sauce.

The final analysis:  reasonable prices, reasonable food."}
{"text":"If you like Vietnamese food check out this place. It has authentic Vietnamese food that is delicious and will not break the bank. I highly recommend it. Service is great and I enjoyed everything I had. I got the fresh shrimp rolls and beef noodles."}
{"text":"Very much your classic mixture of Asian cuisine, mainly Vietnamese in one place. Servers have gotten better over the years, more attentive to orders. All of the food come out super quick! Definite plus. 

My family and I ordered the salt & pepper squid (calamari), house chicken, beef pho, Chinese broccoli, and house fried rice. All very delicious & our regular orders to say the least. We always get Thai iced teas as well. 

Saigon pho is my fave restaurant for pho in the east valley!"}
{"text":"This place is a little bit of a dive but in a weird way it is unique and good.  It may take some getting used to it but once you do, you'll get the hang of it and like it the way I do.  My husband introduced this to me and what pho is about.  Their other dishes are good too.  Try the basil chicken with another entre like mixed vegetables, it is really good especially , if your sharing because portions are big.  The waiting staff hardly speaks English so it is best to order straight from the menu without a lot of changes. Again, for a mom and pop Vietnamese type place without the fuss, this is good."}
{"text":"My favorite Pho in this area.  You walk in through the door and there isn't a waiting area, you get seated promptly because they have two large dining rooms with plenty of seating.  

We always have kind gracious servers here...  they are so accommodating if you have diet preferences. 

We ordered the Crispy chicken.  It's a half a chicken deep fried to a crispy, no batter, super light and clean for your pallets even tho it's fried.  It comes with a delightfully sweet soy dipping sauce that will seriously rock your world, it's so good.

My son ordered beef chow fun, it was 97% gone before I could snap a photo, nice sized portion too, he loved it!

Pho Tai - oh their broth is soooo good.  Light, fresh, the depth of the flavors is perfection and that first sip just warms your soul to the core.  

We also got the salt and pepper squid.  Oh snap!  This is the dish that is so naughty but you just can't come here without ordering.  This isn't that fake squid rings, this is the real deal, lightly battered, flash fried and topped with salty pepper scallions and onions on a bed of lettuce.  It's magnificent.

If you are in the area - yo must come and try out this place, you will become a regular...  and you're welcome!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We have tried almost everything on the menu and the staff is friendly, super quick service and food is always hot. Our favorite dishes are the crispy egg rolls, pho Thai, house crispy chicken, salt pepper calamari and the best house fried rice! Top it off with the fresh coconut water or thai tea. They really treat you like family here. Also the prices are great and affordable. We are certainly return customers."}
{"text":"I got take out.
But it wasnt bad.. it wasnt great.. it wasnt memorable. I expectd way better based on others reviews and pictures. So... I cant even explain.
We got a #27 and a #23. Bother were lacking in spice, flavor, uniqueness. Seriously I was so underwhlemed and upset. I was just eating to eat... I do not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It is the best pho I've had in Phoenix and it is cheap.  You can have a meal, plus tip, for less than $10.  My favorite is the curry pho, I believe they call it Thai style.  It has some heat and some sweet from coconut milk.  I add in the jalapenos and basil and enjoy.  All their dishes are great so don't be worried about ordering something new."}
{"text":"I will admit the food is good, the service is as quick as a fast food drive thru restaurant. Eventhough the service was quick, it was very unfriendly, I guess that's the price you have to pay for quick service. Another thing, they are not kid friendly. If you have kids under the age of 15 years old, do not take them there. My 1 year old was playing with chopsticks and dropped them on the floor, the lady cleaning of the tables, picked them up and ran away with them, never to be seen again. She never brought us another pair of chopsticks to replace the ones she took. Of course, we didn't need them, my wife was using a fork and I was using my chopsticks. I think they didn't like my kid playing with the chopsticks, so that may be why they took them away and didn't bring us an extra pair. 
In conclusion, I would eat there again, but only carry out. I will never sit there and eat. There is too many other restaurants out there, to have to settle on such an unfriendly place."}
{"text":"Got here 30 min before closing on a Monday night. Ordered the crispy egg rolls, Pho Saigon (a specialty with sliced beef, tendon, tripe and meatballs) and beef chow fun (noodles).  Food starts arriving in minutes and kept coming!   Good cheap eats and quick service!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for pho! The food is reasonably priced and everything we try is delicious. The staff is great at helping us pick out new items to try, and they treat us like family every time we step foot in the door. Highly recommend this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The best pho in all the land!!! 

Also try the amazing egg rolls served with fresh mint and lettuce leaves for wrapping! The spring rolls taste so good, and they are so healthy, light and clean. I feel like I just left Canyon Ranch after I eat them!!! For realz!

They make anything you want by request;  they have a real chef in the kitchen!!! 

SO YUMMY, all for less than a trip to Starbucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall good tasting broth rare beef was tender meatballs were good noodles were ok some clumped together but minimal, I think they specialize in other dishes fish mostly, pho is limited in selection, if I go back I would try something other than the pho would give them 3.5 if possible, pho is decent but the viet coffee would be well below average"}
{"text":"The service is usually terrible, but the food has always been good.  I really like the broth in their Pho."}
{"text":"Awesome food along with very quick and super friendly servers! They always find an available table and are prompt to serve. Thai teas are awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese, so I know damn well what it should be like. First of all, every place with a rice dish will have short-ribs ( i didn't want pork chop). Ok no big deal, I'll take your other beef. They brought out cooked shrimp and beef in less than 5 minutes....does that sound right? I tried eating my food but my meat was cold. I poked Around with my finger and every part was cold. I politely told the lady I can't eat this. I walked out and she followed out and told me they can warm it up for you. Hell no I will not take spit in my food, no thank you!"}
{"text":"Had this place for lunch today. It was a little busy. Nothing to spectacular about the place. Had the pho. It was ok, about the norm for Arizona. Prices were about right. I'd say this place is average."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants - love the pho here. Just wish it was closer to home!  Love the pho and vermicelli noodle dishes especially."}
{"text":"I'm from the northwest so it's tough to find phö like the ones back home. However this place is the bomb.com, large portions for a great price."}
{"text":"I remember going to Saigon Pho with my family in high school but unfortunately the food quality and service has declined over the years. The Pho is very average and the rice dishes have very little protein with it. Very little BBQ pork or egg cake as well. My guy loves Bun bo hue and the soup wasn't as spicy as he would have liked it. Way better homemade. 

Service has been really bad - hunting down for the bill, chasing for water or drink refills. I'm Asian, I get it, mom and pop places don't really care about excellent service but the food should be able to make up for it. Unfortunately, it does not here."}
{"text":"My go-to place for a cheap and tasty pho and love their crispy spring rolls! I come here because of the value, quick service and because I'm a fan of dives, albeit they've spruced up their decor which is totally fine with me! Still love this place all the same! My kids love to come here too and we order pretty much the same things at every visit - spring rolls, pho tai, bun bo hue, sweet & sour pork chops (ketchupy, but kids like it), crispy chicken. Because 2 of my boys are teenagers, they are starting to get their own meals like the rice dishes with either bbq shrimp or beef. For the 6 of us we usually spend about $35 to $40 - spectacular for our wallets! We'll keep coming here forever."}
{"text":"Love the fried fish and lobster!!!! The soups are okay ! They're seafood dish are better !!"}
{"text":"It just doesn't get better than this place, in every way... service, quality, value, taste, etc.  And I can't over-emphasize VALUE!!!  This is just plain old CHEAP, yet lacks nothing in quality.

I've been to this place dozens of times, and I would give it a 5 every time.

Get the lemonade.  Trust me!!  It's made in house, and is such amazing."}
{"text":"I went on a kick for a while searching the valley for the best Vietnamese food possible. Hands down this is the winner! The soups are amazing, actually everything we've had is amazing. And we always see a lot of people eating there does seem to enjoy the authenticity of the place. Mostly it's all Vietnamese people that are eating there. Everything on their table looks amazing, but I have no idea what it is! I keep wanting to go there to try new things but everything that I've tried it has been so good that I just keep ordering the same few things. He is good, as are the spring rolls."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. My mom was such a regular they would bring her egg rolls before she ever ordered them. I highly recommend the summer rolls with tofu and the fried spring rolls to start. They are delicious. The summer rolls are light and tasty and the spring rolls are also light, with great crunch and no grease flavor. My favorite rolls in AZ. I get the number 25, vermicelli noodles with beef and a spring roll. I like the peanut sauce but I don't do the fish sauce. They also have a delicious spicy beef with sticky rice. Those are my go to orders. My mom loves the pork vermicelli with egg roll and their fish sauce. Haven't had the pho, but this place is usually packed and pho seems to be the most ordered item. The service is quick and not overly friendly, but they are patient and never make you feel rushed. The prices are amazing too! Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"I used to live across the street and my kids and I ate here a couple times a week the 3 years we lived in Chandler. I usually get the vegetable pho with chicken, my son has the sliced beef pho and my daughter lives the chicken and rice soup on the back of the menu. The servers call it porridge. It's delish. We also love to get the fried egg rolls we wrap in lettuce leaves with fresh mint.I've tried a few other items on the menu and they have all been delicious. We moved to the Rim 6 months ago and every time we come to the valley we make a trip to Saigon."}
{"text":"This place is always busy...food comes out pretty quick.  We usually end up there at least once a week.  Everything we tried has been great!  My favorite is the fried tofu and Saigon Pho.  For lunch, make sure you get there early...or late if you want a table.  Otherwise, you might end up at the big table with other people."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in Arizona so far.....had the vermicelli pork and shrimp...mmmm delicious.....the thai ice tea was surprisingly not too strong, which in turn made it better than any i had before. Well done and the food was done super quick....the ladies were very nice."}
{"text":"Why have I not been here before? In 3.5 years of living in Arizona, I have been searching for a legit Vietnamese restaurant and this is finally it! 

We ordered the duck egg noodle soup and the pork chop, shrimp, beef broken rice. Oh man. The flavors were on point! The broth of the soup was flavorful and yummy. The egg noodles were thin and just the right consistency. The duck was tender and juicy. Warms your belly! All the meats in the rice dish were well seasoned and awesome!

Service was super fast and efficient. I appreciate attentive staff that make sure you get everything you need.

Definitely will be back to try more dishes!! :)"}
{"text":"I came here with a large group with about 20 people so we had two tables.  The 2nd table ordered their dinner first and seemed to get all of their dishes within 10 to 15 minutes of ordering.  However, the table I was at ordered about 5 to 10 minutes after our other table, but it took like 30 minutes for our food to come out.  The server taking our order was distracted the whole time while taking our order.  Each table ordered the Spring Rolls, Beef Chow Fun, House Special Fried Rice, Crispy Fried 1/2 Chicken, and Fish Filet Special Sauce.  Our table also ordered the spicy green beans.  The other table also ordered the BBQ Beef.  In general all the food was pretty good probably a 5 but the portion sizes leave a lot to be desired.  I as well as some other in my party had been here before noticed that the portion sizes were noticeably smaller.  In addition the lady waiting our table messed up our spring roll order for fried egg rolls and blamed it in us with an attitude (maybe if she wasn't soo distracted), though she corrected the problem.  Our other table ordered a second order of Fish Filet with Special Sauce after they had eaten theirs and asked how long it would take for the second order.  The server said 5-7 minutes--it took almost 30 minutes!!

Maybe it's just me, but most of my experiences at Chinese/Vietnamese/Asian restaurants within the past few years just seem to be bad.  Maybe my below average expectations at these types of restaurants have to be so low that everything will be good.  Though I don't think I should have to lower my expectations at Asian restaurants because I've also been to American and Mexican restaurants with mostly good experiences."}
{"text":"This is one of the first Vietnamese restaurant I have been to in Chandler. They're location is perfect because sometimes I shop at LeeLee for groceries and I get hungry. I stop by here all of the time because the prices are cheap and services are pretty quick. My faves are eggrolls which comes with lettuce so you can use it to wrap your eggroll around it then you dip it with the fish sauce they give you. So good. I like their house crispy chicken also. Nice and crispy taste. Good flavor. Comes with soy sauce and a bit sweet but good! I also love their salt and pepper shrimp or salt and pepper lobster! All seafoods are market price. So if you're craving for good afforadable vietnamese food . Go here! I wouldn't suggest eating their pho though. To me it isn't that great.. But other than that everything else is good;)"}
{"text":"We arrived at Saigon Pho for dinner at 7:00pm on a Sunday evening, which was an hour before closing time.  We were promptly seated and our waitress took our order right away.  Our order consisted of string beans, egg rolls, and beef pho.  The string beans had good texture and flavor, the egg rolls were tasty, and the pho was really delicious with well-cooked firm noodles and medium rare beef.  Overall food rating - 4.5/5.

The service was efficient and mostly friendly, but we did feel some pressure to rush our meal due to the proximity to closing time.  The pressure from staff was mostly directed at folks who had arrived after we did, but our dinner was also impacted by it.  I did feel the pressure was unwarranted in any case.  Overall service rating - 2.5/5.

It appeared to me that the soup bowls had gotten smaller from the last time I was here.  Saigon is still a good value with reasonable prices, good food, and mostly reliable service, but next time I will avoid evening hours altogether due to the bad vibe at this time.  Overall rating 3.5/5."}
{"text":"I am a fan, the food is always great and in good portions at a very reasonable price, service is friendly and fast.  My favorites are the salt and pepper squid and the beef and basil chow fun."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot when we are craving pho.  It's close its really good and it's affordable.  Can get a little packed but there's a lot of seating. 

The staff does seem short with you trying to be quick serving you.  Just put the drinks and food on your table almost as a walk by.  Other then that no complaints. 

The food is fresh and always on point to taste.  Once you order the food comes out quick which is the way to go. 

There's live lobster and crab in tanks which gives it a little seafood smell when you walk in but clearly goes away once the food is in front of you.  

Highly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Saigon Pho is probably the cheapest pho I have ever seen in all of Arizona. $6 for a huuuge bowl of pho, of course I'll bite! I came here with my uncle and cousin for lunch and it was packed. Even so, the service was friendly and the food came out fast. I had the chicken pho, while the other two had their regular pho. The egg rolls we got were just so-so, but the soup was delicious. Not the best pho I've ever had but I will come back whenever I have a craving for Vietnamese while I'm at home."}
{"text":"Put your head down and get your slurp on!
Went for lunch today. Ordered the shrimp and veggie
spring rolls as an appetizer. I don't know why I do that, the soup is enough for two. My pho choice was #17 Spicy beef (Hu Tieu Sate). Lots of flavors in this one and it has the big wide noodles, very filling. The restaurant is pretty big with lots of tables. They were almost at capacity @Noon. Service was friendly. Great value at $5.95 for the soup. This is not strictly a pho joint. They have a variety on thier menu, check the website.
Would not hesitate to go back if in the area."}
{"text":"My co-workers are regulars for lunch. This place us fantastic. I've always tried different things to eat, and I have never been disappointed. The vegetable rolls are great. Fresh vegetables are great."}
{"text":"After several recommendations from a white techie friend who love this place, I've decided to give this place a try.  It is NOTHING special since I've had thousands of Pho in my life.  They were playing Chinese music and I can order in Chinese.  In order to get a 4 star from me, food will have to be above par and it wasn't.  The portion were French so that a half star deduction.  I will have to be pressed hard to return to this place again."}
{"text":"Consistency.

Saigon Pho is consistently good.

We've been patronizing Saigon Pho ever since about 2005 when Noe, a classmate of mine, said that Saigon Pho has \"the best pho in the valley.\" We really enjoy this place. The service is good, the food comes out quickly, and the prices are not bad.

We usually get the pho called \"Saigon Pho\" (#10), spring rolls, and egg rolls. Sometimes my kids get young coconuts and/or Thai iced tea. The beef chow fun and house crispy chicken are also very good.

I should have reviewed Saigon Pho many years ago, but kept forgetting to do so. This isn't a very long review because there's only so many ways to say that this place is excellent!"}
{"text":"Pho Sho, this pho is good to go!   Lol, no really they do take out!   I always eat in when visiting this establishment and the service is always fast and friendly.  They have great pho and what I love about it is the broth. There is just something so great about it.  They are also very liberal with the sides and give plenty of veggies. (Sometimes tough to get the right amount of basil and what not at other pho spots.)  

If you're a seafood lover then the Dungeness crab is one of those \"must try's\". It's a live crab from the tank(poor guy) steamed and then bathed in a delicious sauce. 

The beef salad is also very nice and hits the spot of your looking for an app or a quick bite.  It's not to large though so sharing is not a good idea. 

Enjoy the pho and try that crab pho sho!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here at Saigon a few good times but never by choice.  Mr. W.'s family loves it here but I really don't care for the place. 

The servers [and owner too I believe] are all Chinese who love to stand around and gossip about their patrons.  Don't be fooled by their friendly smiles.  They talk a lot of smack.  

The food is mediocre at best but it's super cheap eats.  You get a lot of noodles for your pho and plenty of herbs and condiments but the broth is bland.  The spring rolls are served a bit warmer than I feel safe but their egg rolls are delicious.  I do enjoy their beef stew as well."}
{"text":"I have been here about three times and the first times I got beef combination pho, fried fish and the spring rolls.  They were both very delicious and was for a great price.  The fish was so good that everyone kept on eating off my plate!  The third time I came, I had the duck egg noodle soup and it was very bland and the duck was basically just boiled into the soup.  I took two bites and couldn't finish because it was so unimpressive. 

The place looks like it is a little dirty, but I assure you the food is good... just not duck soup.  My friends love this place and go here all the time.  It is great for small groups, but can handle big groups."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times. At least once a week. I asked her today she said like 44 times. Probably not that much but it definitely is worth the 5 star rating. Service. The price. And now for the food: Sliced beef Pho. Spring rolls. Beans with minced pork. Chicken curry is also a must try. Come here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We eat there 1 to 2 times a week.  I suggest you try the combo fried rice which is an off menu item.  Also the curry chicken noodle soup is excellent.  Lastly, if you have enough money, spring for a robster, think Americans pronounce it lobster.  

nom nom nom"}
{"text":"I can't believe I still haven't written a review for Saigon Pho...

I have been going here for about 7 years and their prices still haven't changed. That 7 years mark should tell you how great they are. I have also been to about 5 other Vietnamese places in the East Valley, but Saigon Pho keeps me coming back.

Spring Rolls - Amazing
Anything else - Amazing
Service - Fast and Friendly

The food is cheap, and the portions are large. 

Boom.

::drops mike::"}
{"text":"Yum! Never a let down. Fantastic pho and the egg rolls with fish sauce are a must try. I also love the thai iced tea. Nice staff and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Service was good here amidst a bit of a crowd but the food came hot and fast. I unfortunately didn't care much for the flavors of the spicy pho or the amount of shellfish throughout the menu (allergies.) The menu was a bit challenging to decipher but that's my problem, not theirs. I'm sure others out there may love this place, but I probably won't go back. Tummy issues...."}
{"text":"My favorite pho spot! It's always busy but they have fast and friendly service. The food is consistently good. My usual are the egg rolls, pho or vermicelli, and Thai tea. Portions are the perfect size and the cost is reasonable. I see people eating all kinds of yummy goodness like whole fried fish and soups. But I tend to stick to my usual."}
{"text":"The best Pho I have had. I'm also very picky because I only like white meat chicken Pho and this place's Pho Ga is the bomb. The food is fresh. The prices are unbelievably cheap. And the staff is very very nice."}
{"text":"Vietnamese shrimp spring rolls and Spicy Basil Chicken for lunch today - Awesome! (see the video posted w/ this review) Our waitress was RUNNING so, it doesn't get much faster than that. Make no mistake, this is a popular place for a multitude of reasons, excellent food at a great price being one of the foremost...just ask the people who were operating the asian restaurant next door - they're out of business, with a chain on the door now, damn! I've been here a half dozen times and the food has always been tasty and well-prepared, the Pho soups are outstanding - you not belief! If you come here expect hot, delicious food, quick service, and reasonable prices. Berserker!"}
{"text":"Location: There is plenty of parking in front of the restaurant. Saigon has been around for quite some time and decoration could be a bit old. However, the tables and booths are still clean for the most part. .

Service: service is speedy if you want to just eat (get in and out). They do deliver the bills on your table as soon as you are done. Workers are polite. 

Food: I usually ordered the rare round eye beef Pho. I've noticed the portion has become a bit smaller. Overall, it is still good. Their fresh coconut is always good. 

Rating: I will recommend you to come here for a quick authentic Vietnamese meal."}
{"text":"The price was perfect! Especially for the amount of food you get. Will def be returning soon!"}
{"text":"What blows my mind is how this place has a four star rating with 300+ reviews. I have no complaints about the service. It's the typical cut throat Vietnamese service so it didn't bother me. I'm from San Jose, it's normal. This review is on the quality of food. 

I don't come here. My family & friends have been here before & they tell me never go. It's not up to our usual Bay Area standard of Pho & the place just doesn't feel clean. It smells like a fish market when you walk in. And don't get me wrong, nothing wrong with a fish market, but a restaurant shouldn't smell that way. 

I was here because the group I was with voted to eat lunch here. I was a passenger sooo wherever they went, I did too. I knew to stay clear of the Pho. So I tried their pork mince & green beans. I asked them if they could add garlic but they said they could only replace the pork with garlic. I couldn't have both. Strange. And as if the smell didn't make the ambiance unappetizing, I found a full length piece of hair in my food! I was done. 

I don't know what my friend ordered but she let me try this tofu looking dish. You know the smell of a cow pasture? Yeah, it tasted like that. Just never again. I hate giving bad reviews but I wouldn't want someone to experience what my family & friends & myself have."}
