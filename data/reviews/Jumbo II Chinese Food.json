{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese food around; a gem that this area has been missing. The wait staff is very friendly and they offer the most high quality lunch buffet I've seen (not to mention at a great price)."}
{"text":"So out of curiosity I I used the drive through...which I must admit was particularly amusing because you cannot simply stay in the drive through and wait on your order to be finished if someone else is behind you. Nope, you have to circle around the parking lot once and  get back in line so that the customer behind you can pay. Which could very easily get tricky if someone else were to pull in ahead of you before you circle around.   As for the food it was greasy, overcooked, and overpriced. Unless you're starving and craving Chinese it's not worth it. Especially with a Wendy's across the street."}
{"text":"I have never been inside but order frequently to be delivered. The food always arrives promptly and is hot. Large portions and I have never had a bad meal. I usually order General Tso chicken, shrimp and vegetables, shrimp lo mein, or egg foo young. For the price and compared to other chinese restaurants who deliver this is a great place.I also custom order low sodium or no sauce or extra mushrooms or bok choy  and they always accommodate my order. The lo mein noodles are hand made daily.  If you plan on using the drive through-- order over the phone first so you will not have to wait while your food is prepared. Eric the delivery man is very nice and personable and one of the reasons why I return over and over as a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Horrible.  This place gives inedible chinese food a bad name.  After my meal I drove straight to the pharmacy for a preemptive purchase of Imodium and Pepto."}
{"text":"I had Wonton Soup and Vegetable Fried Rice delivered to my house. The Wonton Soup was darker than I've ever seen it which immediately turned me away from it. Inside of the Wontons was dark colored meat that did not look like chicken. The fried rice was tasteless and discolored.  All in all, the food was not appetizing and didn't look edible. I wasted about $15 and will not be ordering from Jumbo II again."}
{"text":"After several visits over the last few months, I have to change this.  Sadly one of my favorite places that has now turned into a place I won't visit anymore.  I'll just list many of the things that are now keeping me away... things that were once not the case but which seem to now be the norm:  - Arbitrarily closed Monday lunch buffet. - A month or two later, buffet table is broken.... - And was told it will not be fixed because they are stopping their buffet Jan 1. - Tables are very poorly set (only one has soy sauce, two had hot mustard, sporadic sugars, etc). - Asked for water, got room temperature soap-tasting water. - Waited almost 5 minutes for a server to come by, while I was only customer in the place, all while another employee was eating just a few tables away. - Ate dinner with a friend, his dinner came out 10 minutes before mine and he was almost done eating when mine came. - Our appetizers came out and the server told us they were not hot... and asked if we wanted them heated up... taste test confirmed this... cups were warmed up perhaps a few degrees... soup still nasty. - My food came, and while some of sauce and vegetables were quite good, some of the vegetables literally were not cooked and were actually cold.  Couldn't believe it.  It's sad giving a review like this to a place I ate at for almost 2 years.  But over time the service has just declined."}
{"text":"***UPDATE: RESTAURANT IS NOW CLOSED***  I'm not positive the exact reason but I have been informed that Jumbo II is now closed, possibly due to not meeting healthy code standards :("}
{"text":"Really the food here is great... It is actually deserving of a much better location. It is actually a good location on the corner of a busy business area with a sears outlet.... wendy's, guitar's center, and a few other things it is just that so many things in that building went down fast. This place took over and did very minor renovations. New signs on the outside of the building. Rumor had it that they had gutted the kitchen and rebuilt. I peaked in one day through the window and the kitchen looks spotless and brand spanken new. They took out this awkward looking sort of bar and put in a lunch buffet which is nice. They have full service eat in service as well as an oddity of drive thru service. Weird I know. The decor of the dining room is very bad. It is the same from its old owner with minor teaks just to get rid of some of the dirty beyond cleaning stuff.... It is just kind of gross... It would seem as though the heat and air do not work in the building. When I ate there in the summer is was hotter than hot.... when I ate there in the winter they pulled out a fake electric fireplace heater to put by our table since the heat was not working. Hopefully once they get everything working it will be a nice place. I hope it does well the food is really very good. Much Much better than that location."}
{"text":"So, there have been so many Asian restaurants in this location over there years, some good, some bad. We stopped in today for lunch (Saturday) since we were in the area. The place is dingy. Small tables. Set with some packets of sweet and sour and mustard. The soy sauce container had dried soy sauce crusted all over it. Not really enticing. They brought out appetizer plates to the table for our spring rolls. My plate had some sort of residue on it. I asked for a new one and got a teacup saucer. But at least it looked clean.   There were kids hanging out in the dining room, I'm assuming the cook/owner's kids? They were very cute, but it was kind of strange.   I admittedly ordered something from the \"diet\" menu so I'm not going to critique the food today.  The other people I was with seemed to enjoy their meals.   All told, lunch for 4 people was $17, so I guess I can't complain that much... but I don't think I'll be back... at least while JUMBO II is on the sign.  Maybe I'll try again when the next Asian restaurant comes to the location."}
{"text":"Well... I was really hoping this local Chinese lunch buffet met my tastebud standards. Unfortunately, the only thing that met my standards was the price! For only $5.75, you get a beverage and the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet.  ATMOSPHERE:  Not very open to the busy Lorain Road, this little building is set back behind Malley's and across from Guitar Center. I saw it months ago from Lorain (while stopped at a light) and wondered what that was. Then, it was a bright salmony-pink building. When I finally got a chance to visit it recently, the building is now drab white. Outside there were various, cheap Asian statues. Also, from the parking lot, in full view, there was an industrial bucket, rags and cleaning supplies left out by the side of the building... Hmmm... Not a good sign of what was on the inside.    Upon entering this decidedly older building, the menu and counter area was dark paneled, the living room-sized dining area walls were painted mint green, with cheap plastic Asian plants, flowers and wall hangings dotting the corners, tables and walls. The tables & chairs are clunky, heavy wood -- like I'd expect to see in a Fisherman's Wharf restaurant. Nothing looked spotless.   We were greeted by a nice older woman and immediately asked if we were here for the buffet. We had not even looked at the hard to read menu on the back way. But, yes. We were there to test their buffet. She told us to grab a plate next to the register, and we could sit anywhere. We decided to find a table first. It was easy. There were maybe 20 tables and only 5 were taken. Perhaps what disturbed us the most was 3 tables were taken over by the owner's young children!! These adorable little Asian girls would sometimes yell to each other as they played with their TOYS sprawled across their tables. Puzzles, dolls, books, building blocks -- all strewn around their tables. Now, I understand that finding good daycare may be hard for some people. But, I thought it was completely inappropriate to leave your 3 little girls (all under 10 years old) to play in the dining room of your restaurant!!! No supervision whatsoever!! Their mother was busy running the kitchen, leaving another woman to handle the front counter service.   FOOD:  Okay. As if the atmosphere alone didn't turn us off to this place, we ventured to the small counter next to the register that was the buffet. OK -- let's be honest. The \"buffet\" was only 5 feet long, a thin glass panel sneeze-guard and silly bright lights above the metal food bins.   Problem: the heating lights were NOT HOT!! This left all the food suseptible to becoming highly contaminated!!!   The food in the buffet bins was less than plentiful, and many bins only had a spoonful or two left in them. Not attractive nor enticing. We waited a short time for some fresh food to come out of the kitchen. When it did, the cook brought it out in a little saucepan and dumped it into a bin. If it wasn't what we were wanting, we had to wait another few minutes for her to bring it out in another little saucepan.  Not very efficient at all.   I tried the Sweet & Sour Chicken, Black Pepper Chicken and egg rolls. The egg rolls were good. The Black Pepper Chicken was spicy hot, but lukewarm in actual temperature. And, the Sweet & Sour sauce was so cool, it was beginning to gel... Gross!!    Disappointed is the word. I would love an affordable AND tasty Chinese buffet restaurant in North Olmsted. However, where JUMBO II is concerned, I am left without one.   My lunch mate commented that I should contact Robert Irvine from FoodNetwork's show \"RESTAURANT IMPOSSIBLE\"!!  Not a bad idea -- Mr. Irvine would have his work cut out for him, for sure. But, he could really turn this place around & make sure quality food is served at proper temperatures -- as well as refurbish the cheap, daycare atmosphere!!   With barely consuming any food, we were given the check with 2 fortune cookies. Mine should have read: \"You will be LUCKY if you do not have food poisoning.\""}
