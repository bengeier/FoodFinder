{"text":"I bought a cake from here to celebrate my nephew's 1st birthday. We had the cake in the evening, and several of our guests found fungus in the cake -  fungus! It was so embarrassing and I was so upset. I went back to Granowska's and they gave me my money back plus $5.00 extra for the inconvenience! I've reported this to the health department. Please be careful. We live in the neighbourhood but would never go there again!!!"}
{"text":"Granowska's is a longstanding, family-run bakery, which specializes in cakes and pastries. They make quite a good Napoleon (Napoleonka). They even baked for the last Pope (Polish-born John-Paul II, whose statue is across the street) on his visits to Canada.

But what's really interesting is that, in the same building that sells the sweets, a Granowska sister also has a dental office. I don't know if the bakery does referrals or not, but the irony here is pretty blatant, it'd be interesting to see what dessert is like at some family gatherings."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Granowska's today because I had a craving for perogies and Krak appears to have closed for good:( 

It's more of a deli/take-out place than a restaurant, but there are a few tables, both indoor and outdoor, available. There is no menu, but a sign with daily special posted outside. My friend and I shared two kinds of perogies, meat and sauerkraut with mushrooms. I preferred the latter. The cheddar/potato perogies were sold out that day. The nice Polish lady behind the counter cooked our perogies to order, so they were nice and fresh, with sour cream and a side salad. 

They also have a nice selection of gelatos, including two lactose-free flavours. I had the vanilla which was simply delicious. My friend had the coffee crisp flavour. 

The whole meal came to $20 for both of us. Great deal and very filling!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Granowska's for lunch while I was visiting friends in Toronto for a few days. Coming from an area in the States with very limited Polish food, I wasn't really sure what I was getting into. My pickle soup (I know, sounds kind of strange) was delicious, and the bread served with it made for a very filling meal on a cool September day. I was tickled that I was greeted in Polish, even if I had no idea how to respond other than \"Hello\". If you're hanging around Roncey, stop in and try it out."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to stopping in & grabbing a snack with my partner at this family run bakery/deli-place.  We chose our baked good of choice & they cut off a medium sized square for us.

We got to the cash register & gasped.  $13?!  I was shocked.  I wonder if this apple thing has gold flakes baked into it.

The sad part that is wasn't even very good - it tasted like I was eating an autumn-scented candle.

I'll appreciate their baked goods from afar from now on."}
