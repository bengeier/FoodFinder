{"text":"Do not eat here. Perhaps get a latte here if you want a patio to smoke on. Certainly do not allow yourself to be misled by seeing the words \"omelet\" and \"goat cheese\" on the same board. The goat cheese was about a sandwich, not related to the omelet. 

We were hunger headaching and blood sugar crashing and wandering down north Yonge street hoping for sustenance. Food options were scarce, most restaurants not yet being open for lunch. We stumbled across this \"Italian\" cafe offering eggs with (we thought) quality cheese and fresh greens. 

Like I said, we were \"starving\" in a first world problems sort of way, so when the omelet came out covered in Kraft singles, we had to eat. It came with foccaica bread on the side, stale stale breadcrumb quality foccaica. 

This Iranian run Italian joint also advertises gelato, sandwiches, and has several big homemade pies and cakes to sample. Again, do not go here."}
{"text":"I go here all the time for Cafe Latte, just like the name suggests i should. Always friendly warm service. This is the best espresso in the hood. I used to work and deliver a cappuccino and a double espresso to very happy colleagues. 

As for the food, well I go to my coffee places for coffee. I've had a breakfast foccacia that was very good but sandwiches are amazeballs at Boar Sandwiches and La Salumeria Deli just in the neighbourhood, so I spread the love. 

So in short. If you want a great Latte/cappucino/espresso. Stop in here and meet the kindest store owners in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm picky about my coffee. I work in the area and this is my go to place for espresso. I turned my coworkers onto Caffe Latte and now when they're looking for a cappuccino fix, this is their haunt. I look forward to my daily coffee made by the friendly owners.
Seriously, if you want a proper espresso, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"NO GO!

Unfortunately I didn't realize this place was only rated 1 star by another Yelper until after I saw down and had already ordered my food. Was in the area walking around and needed a quick bite, their sign on the sidewalk had a veal on focaccia. Sounded good and looked like a nice little shop. First of all, it wasn't quick as I had to wait 10-15 min for the sandwich and was informed by the husband and wife team they had to make it fresh. When the husband brought it out  it was steaming hot, looked promising but after first bite the focaccia fell apart easily and the veal did not taste very fresh. Must have been  sitting in the fridge for quite some time. Needless to say I won't be back and nor should you!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for a hot chocolate on a cold evening walk and once for breakfast and a coffee!

I give it 3 stars as I was concerned that the man who owns it was not wearing gloves whilst preparing our breakfast and i think it is need of a good clean.

Apart from this i really enjoy it here, the coffees are lovely and fresh and the chocolate is indulgent and very warming. The cake was a little dry but went well with the drinks! 

The service is a little slow but this is because the man was alone and preparing everything fresh to order. It is a little pricey but not shockingly!

Very friendly man who seems like he wants to get to know his customers, i will be returning for one of those delicious hot chocolates!"}
{"text":"Two one star reviews?! Eep, I'm glad I haven't eaten sandwiches here before. 

In my opinion their coffee and cappuccino's are great, especially on the patio in the summer and they have a good selection of traditional Italian desserts. 

My boyfriend bought us a cannolo last summer to split and it was as sweet, creamy and delicious as you'd expect. We come here for a caffeine fix regularly.

This place is run by a husband and wife team. The man is charming as can be and has a real passion for soccer, which he's happy to share with you if you feel like engaging him in a conversation. They have a TINY television inside that plays sports all day, ussually soccer if it's on. The tiny television goes with their quite limited seating.

Honestly, I like this place because it's independent (there are a million chains in the area), it has a great little patio, the owners are as friendly as can be and because they make decent caffeinated drinks."}
{"text":"It's a small independently run Italian coffee house. I love their cappuccinos and sitting outside people watching or thinking of nothing...which is quite frankly, the same! I hardly drink coffee but whenever I feel like a coffee drink, I come here. I'd rather walk up here than make a detour at the Starbucks on the way.

The owners are always present and remarkably friendly, making you feel very welcomed. A little while back ago, the owner was kind enough to tell me about the neighbourhood. Source of knowledge. It's a bit magical when you can engage with the owners of an establishment and have a conversation because you genuinely are interested in sharing something, and not getting your fee.

They sell sandwiches and desserts. Haven't had lunch here yet to comment. In terms of price, I think they are on par with Starbucks! But so worth it."}
{"text":"This panini-gelato-coffee joint is cute as f... Has a very authentic Italian feel to it. A friend and I enjoyed some San Pellegrino and panini on the cute little patio, with FIFA games playing on the small TV. The panini wasn't anything to write home about, but it was decent. Finished the meal off with some yummy gelato.

We met the most darling widowed old man, Mike, who was a regular at this place... It's worth it to come here just to have a chance of meeting him! He was full of adorable and funny anecdotes. He was also raving about the coffee and lattes, so I'd say come here for the people/patio/gelato/coffee :)"}
{"text":"Caffe Latte gets points for longevity on a stretch of Yonge Street marked by permanent change. 

It's been here since I worked at Sporting Life at the turn of the century. 

As caffeinated competitors have come and gone, and the neighbourhood has stepped up it's overall cute coffee joint game, Caffe Latte remains constant. 

The best thing that can be said about the place is it's location. A few wrought-iron tables outside the storefront provide an ideal spot to people-watch on warm summer day. 

It's a great hangout spot, suitable for marginal first dates (you know, the kind where you really don't know if there will be chemistry, or if they'll actually look like their profile picture, or if your Aunt Gladys who fixed you up is a reliable judge of aesthetics \"She's such a NICE girl\"). 

Coffee offerings are reasonable; capable cappuccinos, likeable lattes, etc. pastries are merely OK, and I wouldn't bother with anything more substantial, especially with Pastissima's takeout just up the block. 

Truth be told, if Caffe Latte were to open today, it would likely be swallowed by the competition; outflanked in every category by a whopping number of ice creameries, frozen custard joints, patisseries, gourmet coffee shops and international chains (like the one who's wi-fi I'm using right now) on this stretch. 

But the view's still great."}
