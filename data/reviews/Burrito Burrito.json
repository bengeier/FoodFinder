{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Huge burrito, very filling for a reasonable price. 
The washroom needs to be cleaned better, considering it wasn't busy and the two employees were just sitting down after she served us."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to frequent this establishment on several occasions. In my opinion the food tastes fantastic, it's reasonably priced and the portions are enormous!   My personal favorite is the chicken quesadillas. The staff and especially the owner are extremely friendly and courteous. I'd be weary of adding too much hot sauce to the mix.    I would highly recommend this fine establishment to anyone.  Great Work!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Terrible service, no hot sauce in a burrito place! They ran out and didn't bother to go to the metro and get some more. You can't see them making your burrito. The staff are unknowledgable about the products they are making. Terrible. Don't eat here"}
{"text":"I'm not keen on burritos myself but I had the nachos, they tasted like the bag had been open on the counter for a couple days, I should likely have complained but unfortunately I can be a bit of a wuss.  My husband had a burrito and I think he was just bitter we hadn't gone to fat bastard instead."}
{"text":"At Burrito Burrito it really is awesome! If you are looking for a nice relaxing place to eat after a long day, Burrito Burrito is the place to be! Whenever I take a bite from a Burrito, from Burrito Burrito, my mouth waters because of their finest ingredients. I always want to come back for more! It's also a nice atmosphere where everyone is welcome, so go ahead and treat yourself. I definitely think that Burrito Burrito has the best Burrito! I recommend all to try for yourselves!!"}
{"text":"Very good and friendly ordering service from the man in charge.  They did my halibut well done, extra crispy - much appreciated!

The halibut burrito was VERY good!  Best in the neighbourhood.  I also got a chicken taco (yes, I know -  gluttonous).  It was quite tasty with the nacho cheese! 

Not cheap, but welcome to Liberty."}
{"text":"Had a steak burrito with everything (yes guacamole was free!) except hot sauce and jalapeño.

A+ for the steak seasoning

B- for the seasoning and flavour of the rice, and everything else.

It was just bland, didn't have enough meat and had no salsa. Even the guacamole was bland."}
{"text":"Had the surf and turf burrito bowl today. Although the shrimp had a lovely batter and was delicious, there just wasn't enough. Also, there was very little steak in the bowl. They layered a lot of the beans and next to no cheese underneath it. For a cheese fan, I was disappointed. For almost $10 I've had a better bowl with more meat and more cheese. 

As for the service, they certainly were lovely folks so that alone might be worth trying them again but definitely not the bowl. I imagine the soft tacos will have just the right amount of meat, right? Here's for hoping."}
{"text":"Compared  to Fat Bastard, this place was not tasty  at all. A for  effort but they can't  compare. Owner  was a bit  too confident and they  ran out of GUACAMOLE. How does that  happen at a Mexican  restaurant?! I went because  I  had a Groupon. Will not  be  going back."}
{"text":"Every experience at Burrito Burrito has been fab!  
Food is always fresh and never a long wait.  It's faster than getting a sub sandwich made and more tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is laughable.

Waited 20 minutes for a mediocre, cold burrito. No napkins to be found.

They really don't appear to know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place doesn't have more reviews OR more good reviews for that matter. Had a late lunch here yesterday with a good buddy, and while I admit that it was a tad difficult to find as it was in the Liberty Village Market area (which I might add is a friggin sweet space for independent businesses), this hidden little taste of tex mex was a great find and I was thrilled to be introduced to it. 

A pretty standard take away burrito spot in terms of its set up, however they offer some creative options that I have yet to come across in other similar spots. While they offer the standard burrito options, they also have tacos, burrito bowls and other items as well. 

What really struck me was the difference in size between the standard burrito and the \"double\" being hungry but not wanting to kill myself I decided to opt for the standard measuring in at about 6 inches in length BUT don't be turned off, it likely was about 8+ inches around as asking for \"the works\" gives you a very full burrito. I ordered the surf and turf burrito (something I had not had before - steak and shrimp) and it was excellent!

Being the wannabe budding burrito expert I think what made this place a winner for me was the generous helpings of toppings but not having them overindulge with rice. Far too many times asking for rice in your burrito means a carb overload and certain feelings of being stuffed. I found the put a perfect amount of rice in and filled the rest of the space with more flavourful ingredients. Their Habanero hot sauce is fantastic and is a familiar flavour....I believe I've had it before somewhere else, but it's a fav of mine.

Only negative's for me were -0.5 for being out of Guacamole and minus -0.5 for not putting enough sauce in it upon ordering. Other than that the ingredients were fresh and cooked well and the steak and shrimp were a welcome new experience for me. 

I was comfortable after finishing the standard and I feel the DOUBLE would have been a terrible mistake ha ha. 

Ill be back when in liberty village. ALSO, prices I'd say are slightly above average for burritos but not astronomically out of this world. Give them a shot!

{"text":"Had a steak burrito.....large portion but was not the tastiest burrito I ever had but does take care of your craving. They do have a variety of other flavors (surf and turf) that I haven't tried yet. Burrito boys is still the best."}
{"text":"After Fat Bastard Burrito in Liberty Village became a disappointment I needed a new burrito spot close by. A friend recommended I try this place and I must say it's pretty good. So far I've tried their large chicken burrito (do not attempt unless you are ready to sleep for a couple hours after), steak burrito and a couple of their burrito bowl options. They've all been pretty good. Ingredients are fresh and they're not tight with the guacamole like Fat Bastard is. Id give it a 3.5 star but that's not an option here so I give it a four simply because their large burrito is the size of a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Walked in, very friendly staff, clean tidy establishment, and most importantly a great burrito! Really good portions and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst soft tacos we have ever had! Taco bell is higher quality. We were drawn in by the crowd, but turns out they were in there because of the cold :( Sorry to be harsh..."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite on my way to the TFC game.

Got a regular chicken burrito with all the toppings on a whole wheat shell.

Total came to just under $9.  They prepare their burritos similar to how it's done at burrito.  Toppings are all piled on and it goes on the flat top for a toasting before serving.

First bite was nice because I got the chilling affect of the cold iceberg lettuce.  The rest was kind of disappointing.  Way too much refried beans. The rice tasted a little dry.  The texture of the chicken was a little off, it tasted almost like ground chicken, or chicken that are way too shredded.  I would like to blame that on me going towards the end of business so I might getting the bottom end of the rice & chicken.  Nothing particularly outstanding about the salsa, guac or hot sauce.

The service was nice. It wasn't anything crazy given that it was a quick service restaurant.  They have a couple of tables with chairs where you can sit and eat your burrito inside, and there are also a few tables outside in the alley of the Liberty Street Market where you can sit and enjoy your food.

One thing I did notice is they also serve fries, and they have different levels.  Plain to cheesy to supreme (salsa) and extreme (steak & salsa).  Range from I believe ~$3-4  to just under $8 for the extreme.  I would like to go back and give them a try on the fries."}
{"text":"My husband and I love burritos, we use to trek all the way downtown just to get a burrito from burrito boys or burrito banditos ..but because this place was close to home, we decided to try out this place. Overall, the food was ok. I had the regular size surf and turf (steak and shrimp) and sadly it wasn't anything special. I found that they hardly put enough meat either (they did loaded it up more with the rice and other stuffing). I also had their supreme fries and did not like it at all....it tasted like something you would get at taco bell. The prices were quite fair and the regular size burrito was a pretty good size, but quality of food was disappointing. 

As for service, it was true what others had previously mentioned...it was unacceptable. My husband waited half an hour for 2 burritos and supreme fries and on top of that, they had forgot to make the fries. It was a Monday night too so it wasn't as busy as other nights. 
I don't think we will come here again. It was a quite disappointing experience because we were hoping to find a burrito \"go to \" spot closer to home (Vaughan), but a bad first impression is enough for us to keep looking for another \"go to\" burrito place."}
{"text":"Eh-Oh--Oh-Eh..  Can a bunch of Italians make a good Burrito?  Why absolutely yes!

The Halibut Fish taco was damn tasty and they definitely don't skimp out on anything.  In fact there's no nickle and diming on anything, which I really appreciate.   You have a choice of 12 or 24\" of yummy delight.  I was seriously to my limits on 12\" and wonder what kind of glut punishment that kids will do two 24\" in one sitting.  Loaded fries were also great.

Hopefully the boys get their act together soon and invade Toronto."}
{"text":"I've tried coming here on 2 separate occasions on a weekday after work around 6-6:30pm and both times it's been closed. There's not even a store hours sign on the door or window. So sketch."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and wasn't really impressed by the burrito. The owner very friendly so 5 stars there. Food meh. Nothing to go crazy for. Taste is bland but they do give you a lot of toppings in your burrito or taco.

Give it a try but nothing to go nuts for."}
{"text":"Burrito's are huge, first MEGA burrito I have ever had, actually quite good and more than filling. They are actually big enough to share.

Service is horrible and I do not go there any more despite living in walking distance. 

On the visit that turned me off I was forced to wait and wait while owner spoke with some woman who was not even ordering, after 7 minutes I just walked out in disbelief"}
{"text":"I was craving a burrito for lunch and I remember a friend recommending this place. It was close to home, and I was up for trying some place new besides going to Mucho Burrito which is my fav! 

Atmosphere: quiet & spacious
Cleanliness: tables didn't appear to be clean. I seen a long brown hair on my table before sitting. 
Constructive criticism: there should be a cutlery station for all utensils needed. Ie, fork, spoon, knife, salt, pepper, napkins, straws etc. Would like to see real dinner napkins and not a rough paper towel. It would be appealing for the customer and also be beneficial to the owner if the burrito toppings were visible behind a glass shield. I had to ask which kinds of beans were offered (black or brown). No pulled pork on the menu. It was like he was trying to hide the preparation. I tried to look over the counter to see what was available for toppings besides the offering of \"Would you like everything on it\"? The place had no music. It was silent (awkward much). 
Cuisine: Mexican.
Facilities: I didn't go.
Food: I ordered the chicken burrito on a whole wheat wrap. Topped with brown bean spread, rice, lettuce, tomato, cheese, hot sauce, salsa, guacamole and sour cream. It was flavourful. (Onions and jalapeños were offered but not chosen). 
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: I would return here again because I like the fact that the guacamole wasn't an extra charge like most places, but I much rather go to Mucho Burrito where I can see my choices. 
Parking: private. 
Portion Sizes: large. I was full! 
Price: fair. $11 with a bottle of water. I believe my burrito was the large size.
Service: the Owner seemed friendly and made casual conversation. He didn't offer a choice for what size burrito. I heard the next customer after me request for a small. Had I known...
Selection: good selection. I wish there was pulled pork on the menu though!"}
{"text":"I visit Liberty Village often and was delighted to see that this spot was opening up a few months back. Having been on a Burrito craving spree I quickly looked up their and thought hey these guys might not be so bad. I have tried several Burrito spots in the Queen West / Liberty Area yet I still find myself running towards College Street to get my Burrito Boyz fix. 

One Saturday afternoon me and my sister decided to drop on by at 12pm noon only to notice they were closed. We found this odd and double checked their hours and even called just to make sure they were probably opening late but NOPE. No sign on their door and no notice they just weren't open. This was the start of disappointment. 

The following weekend we figured why not give this place a shot again since we were dying to see what it was all about. When we arrived we checked out their menu and decided to go with the safe bet of getting a chicken burrito. Wow....this place disappointed us big time. Not only was it more expensive than Burrito Boyz..the quality just lacked drastically. Their rice is made a lot differently and almost tasted like day old Portuguese Style rice that has been sitting in the fridge for far too long. The chicken was very chewy and had this awful amount of spice too it as if the spice top fell off the container as they were seasoning the meat. Burrito Burrito unfortunately was very disappointing and kept me away for a very long time. 

Like a bad relationship..I should have seen the red flags once they didn't pick up the phone."}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE!!  I bought a single and a double steak burrito, a fries extreme and a nachos supreme and it nearly cost be $40!  I could have justified the cost if the taste was out of this world - but sadly it was not.

Burritos were tasty but nothing special.  Supreme nachos were very basic with sour cream drizzled and some chopped green onions.  Nachos were prepackaged from a bag.  Fries extreme were the only thing that seemed worthwhile - yummy!

Service was slow and unfriendly.  I can't find any reason to return.  I would say, save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I eat Steak burrito and fries, good portions and friendly place."}
{"text":"This place is a complete joke. I went on three separate occasions and the place has been closed with no sign on the door or explanation. I went on a Saturday at 5:30 and they were closed when they claimed to be open until 3 am. I am not sure what kind of business they are running, but they are very unprofessional. For those in the area, just avoid this place and go to Big Fat Burrito. If they are not serious about being a business, I am not going to give them my money or recommend them. This place is a total avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Was in the plaza at the doc's when I noticed almost everyone kept walking into this place during the lunch hour on a Saturday. Since it was past 1 and my stomach was growling, I decided to give this place a try. Picked up a veggie bowl, bean & cheese burrito & supreme fries.
The bowl was....meh. It looked amazing, especially their portions are huge! But, the cooked down salsa (versus fresh pico), too much lettuce, lack of black beans or guac, and overload of melted cheese (versus fresh shredded) it was one of those moments where I couldn't wait to dig in, and once I did was overwhelmed with the thoughts of \"oh I hate throwing food but this will have to be chucked..\".
The fries were really good, I must say seasoning them prior to putting them together as 'supreme' in a bowl is an excellent idea. However, 'supreme' = melted cheese product + sour cream + green onions....not so supreme after all. Again, just adding a few refried beans or fresh salsa would really pick these up.
The burrito was the same as the bowl, very ho-hum...

This place really had this 'hole in the wall good grub in huge protions' look and feel to it. However, its absolutely nowhere near Chipotle, or even Mucho Burrito. If you are really strapped for options, I guess you could try it. I will not be returning.."}
{"text":"We noticed this place originally on Highway 7, near Islington. Never tried it as we thought we'd be disloyal to Mucho Burrito, our go to place for burritos.

When we discovered that it now has a location at Weston/Rutherford area, we decided to give it a try.

The first few times the wait times seemed abnormally long, but this has gotten much better. They are still longer than at Mucho Burrito, but there it is more of a \"cafeteria style\" (you follow your order down the counter and they ask you want you want on it). Here, you order what you want and they prepare it to your specifications.

I've had the burrito (Chicken/steak) and the quesadias. Both are excellent and filling. They've changed their quesadias and I prefer the way the used to make them compared to how they do it now (portion size has shrunk), however, it remains tasty, just not as filling.

I have gone back on numerous occasions. 

Wait times can be a tad longer if the place is busy, as everything is prepared to order."}
{"text":"I ordered a Steak + Chicken mixed with hot sauce and extra jalapenos. Instead I got a wrap filled with lettuce, beans, & rice doused in Frank's Red Hot (which, for the record, is more salty than it is hot). To be fair, a couple of pieces of chicken & shreds of steak found their way into the burrito. Compared to the superb burritos at Fat Bastard's a 5 minute walk away, these are really overpriced bags of bean paste and rice."}
{"text":"I got the chicken burrito. It was pretty good, I thought it was a little too big (I could literally stand it up vertically), and there was too many beans. Also would have liked it spicier. The chicken itself seemed lost in all the other ingredients, I couldn't really get a good sense of what it tasted like. My girlfriend got the halibut tacos and they were alright as well.

The owner was really nice. This is a decent Mexican joint but nothing special."}
{"text":"I was excited for a new burrito place in liberty village but it was not what I was looking for. I ordered the chicken burrito. It is a pretty simple order but I have had way better. The worst part for me was the ground chicken. If you are going to do a chicken burrito at least some chopped grilled chicken or pulled chicken. The ground chicken did not taste fantastic and when you get those chewy parts in chicken it really turns me off.

 I am going to have to say I am not going to try again. There are other places in the area for similar price and better taste!"}
{"text":"I've been here at lead a dozen times and the burrito is always solid! Portion size hasn't shrunk and the freshness is always spot on. They get busy during the lunch rush so it's wise to call ahead."}
{"text":"it's average for a burrito place, I mean how hard is it to shove food into a wrap and close it.  The burrito bowls are my fave, but they have been getting smaller and less consistent. 

The owner is super sweet, and is trying to keep business flowing, as other shops around there have been sinking - and fast!  But the service is slow, grumpy and if you order the nachos, they are sometimes put into a cold fryer so they just suck up the oil and never crisp up."}
{"text":"I've been he here on numerous occasions now, and have not yet been disappointed. Usually when I come in, the owner himself is working, so I can't say anything about the staff. The owner has always been super friendly with me, and chats with me while preparing my order. 

The portions are monstrous to the point I almost can't finish one, tonight I was super hungry though and was able to wolf down a large steak, I'll be digesting this for the rest of the night, burning calories ;). 

Everything is prepared fresh in store and I find it to be greatly superior to the competition, this is definitely our go to place for burritos. 

Just opened a new location in Liberty Village, so if you're in either area it's worth a stop in, you will be full after this great fresh tasting burrito."}
{"text":"I haven't had many burritos in my life, but that will change now that I've found Burrito Burrito. 
I've tried the chicken and the steak burrito, and they were both amazing. The regular size keeps me full until bedtime! They are a good, hefty portion and they don't skimp on meat. The steak burrito almost has TOO much steak, but hey, I'm not complaining. They don't charge you extra for things like guacomole either...that bugs when other places do that. For what you get, the prices are great (about $7 for regular size chicken or steak). They just opened another location at Weston & Rutherford too, so maybe more Burrito Burritos will be popping up in the future."}
{"text":"I have been there twice and I have to say I love their burritos and fries. They pack the ingredients in there but it does not explode or fall out when you are eating it which is a must for me since I am a messy eater. The fries taste like they came from a high end burger restaurant. I am glad I listened to that random bank teller whom recommended this place to me."}
