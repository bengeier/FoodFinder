{"text":"What a hidden gem.  Food quality is incredible. This is not a \"high end\" dinning place but the food and the service make it feel that way.  To the person that commented that a place where the entrees cost $25.00 dollars should have more than 10 different wines in stock, really??? $25.00? Have you ever been to a \"fine dinning\" place? In fact, they have 60 different kinds of wine. One of the staff, Leon, is as anal as I am. He makes sure all the labels on the wine bottles are placed on the racks so that they are the right side up and all the same level. The prime rib burger is one of the best I have ever had. I haven't been disappointed in the other menu items either. That have Confit Chicken Wings, done in duck fat and all!!!  I normally sit at the bar, but if I'm in with my girlfriend, then the booths give me the right amount of intimacy. I don't need to see what others are doing around me, I'm there with my girlfriend and need to pay attention to her. Give this place a try and you will not be disappointed. What a difference from when it was \"The Bull and Finch\" back in the early 2000s."}
{"text":"Attention Durham region and Toronto Yelpers. , If you only go to one restaurant this year to spend your discretionary income be sure to try Burbs. My wife and I frequent many restaurants in and around the greater Toronto area as well as the USA.  For a local Bistro I have not found many better for service, friendly professional staff and very very good quality and tasty entre's, apps and deserts. The chef and owner Kevin does a fantastic job with care and quality of everything he prepares and I can attest as I have tried 80% of the dinners and I have yet to be dissapointed. As for the large selection of wines, who needs them when the selection available is great. Keep up the great work Kevin and would like to say hello to our favorite bartender Jackie and also Lyon who is a great worker and person who I would hire in a minute if i were to own a restaurant."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Burbs is a little out of its league.  It bills itself as an upscale restaurant and it certainly charges upscale prices.  But the food was just ok, but not great.  Hubby's steak was probably the best of all of the meals ordered at our table.  One of the kids got the curry chicken, which was also tasty.  However, the two pasta dishes were very disappointing ... gnocchi that tasted like rigatoni in a very heavy oily sauce, and ravioli that tasted similarly.  The wine menu was small and kinda disappointing ... when dinners cost $25, you want more than 10 white wines to choose from.  Finally, the service was slow and artificially perky.  For the kind of prices they charge, i was expecting an awesome experience.  Instead, it was just so-so.  Unless they significantly drop the prices, i don't see a reason to rush back."}
{"text":"I am not someone that eats in fine dining establishments regularly.  I was lucky enough to visit this establishment and WOW!  It is unreal. From the general atmosphere they create that is very welcoming to the food on the plate which I can safely say I have tasted no better! The Keg is one place I like to go to that will cost you a few dollars more than the norm and I love The Keg.   This establishment tops The Keg hands down.  It is also on the same price level as it.   Truly loved it and would go again."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great things about this restaurant so I was looking forward to going there.  I don't think I would consider this an 'up-scale' establishment.  I had the duck and although the dish was good, I wouldn't say it was worth the price.  The atmosphere was okay.  We were seated in a large booth which provided a lot of privacy, so much so, that I couldn't tell you what the rest of the restaurant looked like!  I don't think that I will be returning to Burbs Bistro and Bar any time soon.  As my rating indicates... Meh, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Incredible food and great service. I recommend getting a reservation first as a lot it seems to be a well known establishment amongst locals."}
