{"text":"Horrible! The pizza was cold, they wouldn't warm it up in the oven, tomatoes mushy and crust soggy! Don't waste your money! Yuck"}
{"text":"This is what's wrong with pizza in this province. Like I've said before, if somebody tells you they have a favourite pizza place in town, they have never eaten pizza outside of Alberta. Because the pizza here is awful and nobody knows it. My first (and only) experience at Wicked Wedge was forgettable. I was taken there by someone who had heard good things about it. (Presumably again from people who have never eaten pizza anywhere else). The pizza is terrible at Wicked Wedge. It's like they've discovered a way to suck all of the grease and flavour out of their slices and replace it with a dry cardboard taste. The crust is of the worst I've ever experienced, the sauce is not particularly tasty and the toppings add strange flavours that taste like health food. I had to rush to the Stampede grounds to get real pizza flavour from the crap they sell there during Stampede. That pizza is actually better than Wicked Wedge. If you must have pizza in Calgary, seek out a dirty looking convenience store-style place with dirty looking ethnic men running around and order a real pizza with flavour from them. They will know how to make it and it will taste good and for a lot less than Wicked Wedge....."}
{"text":"Watched my friend eat it and he threw up. Not from the pizza but from the horrible graphic design. Pizza was bad but the poser advertising was worse. \"Best pizza in Calgary\" is wickedly incorrect. Not only will I not return to WICKED WEDGES but I will never go to chinook mall again. West ed has two wedges for $6 much better."}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best pizza I've had in my life. When I was staying in Calgary for a week a few years ago, I had a slice every day. It's the most flavourful 'Za I've ever tasted. They make it artisan style, with only the freshest of ingredients, whole wheat dough and special secret seasonings in the dough. I've never liked crust much. At the Wicked Wedge, I can't get enough of it. They also make their own sauce, which is also infused with tasty seasonings. Seriously, if you're in the Calgary area for a day, you've gotta stop for a slice. They've got a giant list of ingredients if you want to create your own pizza. I can't remember the last time I ever saw asiago cheese and fresh rosemary and basil on such a list. Also, if you like dips, you get one free sauce of your choice with every pizza. I'm not sure if these guys do Crazy Bread, but they should, with their wicked dough."}
{"text":"I'm totally with Carrie P.! Imagine my excitement when I discovered that Wicked Wedge, the notorious pizza joint who's sole location had recently been shut down on 17th Ave., had reopened in the food court at Chinook Center!   So now, not ONLY can you get your Christmas shopping done, but you can sneak in a visit to one of Calgary's greatest pizza joints! How sweet it is!!! Christmas shopping just got a whole lot more bearable!"}
{"text":"The Wicked Wedge is now at the Chinook Center food court!  This is without question my favorite pizza in the city.  This servings are generous and delicious, and now it is dangerously close to my house!  From my home in Riverbend, I am a quick 5 minute drive to Wicked Wedge.

{"text":"I kinda feel like I missed out on the original location, as it sounds like people are in agreement that it was better than the current one in Chinook.  However, that being said, I'm on the go CONSTANTLY and rarely have time to go home and cook, which leads to a lot of eating in places like foodcourts, so it's nice to see a place like this opening in such a convenient location.  To be fair, I've had better tasting pizza. I've had fresher pizza. I've had less greasy pizza. However, when you consider the healthier ingredients and convenience, it's pretty hard to argue with this place. For somebody like me especially who's a huge pizza fan, when you can make it nice and easy to get to, one of the healthier options in the foodcourt AND add in some cool, lesser-seen perks (like Jones rootbeer! Awesome!) You've definitely found yourself another regular customer."}
{"text":"$5.50 a slice and it wasn't even that big of a slice. Pricey - I thought to myself. I ended up ordering the one loaded with vegetables, meat and cheese.  It turned out to be SO GOOD. Just loaded with toppings, tasted really fresh. At first I was annoyed that the pizza was only mildly warm and not piping hot but it was perfect down to the very last bite. Even the end crust was light and crusty and I happy finished it without any dipping sauce.   They don't have a lot of selection to choose from: one veggie, one pepperoni, one hawaiian, and two meat and cheese combos. But I have no complaints. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just so folks know, this location will not be a future home for Wicked Wedge Pizza, another pizza establishment is exploring possibilities at this location.  Wicked Wedge has only one location in Calgary at the food court in the Chinook Centre."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of bad pizza over the years but I've never had a slice this bad.  I got sick from it and won't be back."}
{"text":"Oh Wicked Wedge, why have you moved to a food court?  Maybe it was the beer talking, or the fact that you were always busy on those late night visits that kept the pizza fresh as it flew off the counter and into our mouths... but you just aren't the same anymore.  Known for your tasty pizza flavours, I found those still in place when I visited you in Chinook Centre. But at 7:30 on a weeknight, there were no lineups for your delicious pizza, and the piece I got was not so fresh from the oven.  Part of me is happy that those who loved you in your past life on 17th Ave can now find you in Chinook Centre, but a part of me weeps for the loss of one of my favourite late night eats places. 2 am just isn't the same without you."}
{"text":"I've tried Wicked Wedge a few times, but it's only ever been at food events where you just get a sample.  Yesterday I finally made the move and inhaled a pepperoni wedge at Chinook Mall.  It certainly was better than Pizza Hut, but really just average.  I did like the soft crust, which isn't too thick.  However, there could be more meat and flavor.  I think the price is reasonable for the slice size, but I'll try something else next time and hope it's better.  24/30 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"Been all over the world and I-yii-yii-yii love this pizza. This is my hometown pizza review. We've all got our taste when it comes to pizza and the preferences range from thick to thin crust, how cheesy we like it, also what types of toppings, what style meaning huge conglomerate chain style, or small crafty and artisan style, the list, it goes on and on.  I still crave this pizza to this day. Sometimes you just want that Je ne sais quoi, that surprising delightful variety, something with panache, something with . . . wickedness.    Or maybe it's 5:27pm and you're window shopping looking at Fluevogs along 17th Ave, you went in try on some blue boots but the toes just don't fit quite right. Defeated by your foot shape you decide it's time for a wedge. Or maybe you've just had a few brews at the Ship and Anchor and it's 1:37am and you could use a wedge.  Remember the time we had that broccoli one I ask my palate?  Palate: \"Why yes Shelli, the one with the red onion and Gouda? Gawd that was awesome!\"  (Yep sometimes my palate likes to imitate Chris Farley, whose doesn't?)    I do not agree with Cranky Christopher W's review, and I've had pizza all over the world YO, nothing is like Wicked Wedge. However props to anyone for their love of Spolumbo's sausage, he's got that one right.  You should check out the menu, there's one called \"Pork in the Garden\" it's got the Spolumbo's spicy Italian sausage, green pepper, red onions, feta & mozzarella, oh yeah grab a slice from that Heaven.  Wicked wedge is the best walk in HOT SLICE in my hometown of CALGARY EVARRRRRRRRRRR!"}
