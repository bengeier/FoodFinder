{"text":"The Thirsty Duck is everything you want in a pub - great and laid back atmosphere, good beer selection and good food. Interior is clean and trendy without trying too hard. We had the donair, cobb salad and soup and everything tasted great. The Cobb comes with duck which is a refreshing change. The turkey stuffing soup tasted amazing, one of the best soups I've had but at $8 for a very very small portion, it's a little ridiculously priced. It was just a little bigger than a teacup - as much as I loved it, I wouldn't get it again based on the price to size ratio."}
{"text":"Went this afternoon and I had beer and Halifax donair, Donair was best one I had in Toronto, price was 12$ which was a little steep but I'm a sucker for a donair.
Service was great very quick turnaround, all in all a very pleasant place."}
{"text":"I do not understand why the price point is $$$$.  This is a local, with great staff, good people and and loyal clientele. It's a welcome addition to a hipster over saturated market. It's at best $$ and five stars of fun."}
{"text":"Everything you want in a cozy neighborhood pub. Well executed east coast comfort food, great beer and whiskey, super friendly staff (Amy is awesome!) and the 60% ground brisket 40% ground bacon burger with an egg and cheese is full of flavor."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place ever since seeing the sign announcing it was opening in place of the shady Chinese restaurant.  

It has the charm of a small-town, intimate restaurant where you casually run into people you know.  It's very clean and the decor is nice.

The food was great.  I had the Thirsty Duck burger, a blend of beef and bacon which keeps the very thick patty juicy and delicious.  It may have been the best burger I've had at a proper sit-down restaurant.  The beer menu was very good too.  Though, maybe a bit pricy.  But not out of step with other places nearby.

The space is very small.  What I didn't love was being told that, even though it was 60% empty, we could only sit at a 2-person table.  That really limits the options.  There are a bunch of high tops across from the bar, but then you have to sit side by side on a booth and share a very small table that barely fits two plates.  

We heard the waitress tell another couple that they had to sit at a small table because they keep all the others for bigger groups and \"we get busy\".  News flash - lots of restaurants do! And people wait if they want to eat there.  I get if they don't want people lingering all night and holding up a table, but surely there must be other methods than preventing people from being more comfortable when the place isn't busy."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's casual, it's cozy, the food is amazing.

I had the fish and chips. Portion was huge and the batter was super crispy. The fish was fresh. The fries are also very good. I loved it. 

I could not decide between the duck sandwich or the fish and chips but from the looks of the fish and chips at the table next to us, I was sold. I love bacon but the fish and chips was hailing me.

The menu was very interesting, they had this pepperoni snack that seems to be popular.

The food came fairly quickly and service was good. They were very busy so we didn't see our waitress for awhile.

Overall it was a good experience and I'm dying to go back to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Decent gastro pub with a good selection of beers and screens to watch sports. The food, though, is pretty bad. The wings were very under seasoned, the shrimp on toast tastes like it has a whole garlic bulb on it (and I like a lot of garlic) and the  donair was swimming in dolce de leche (it was so sickly sweet it was inedible)."}
{"text":"Only came for a glass of wine to check out the newest hot spot in leslieville and i am instantly in love. Ive never reviewed a place before but felt compeled to share what a great vibe this place has. And joey! The owner, personable, friendly, engaging, made me feel like a friend in his home. Definately a welcoming place that i love to be a part of. See for yourself :)  
...only not giving 5 stars because i haven't tried the food."}
{"text":"Incredible food and amazing service! Everything is made in house and every single thing on the menu will blow your mind! This is definitely a must visit for delicious comfort food and an awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night. I love the atmosphere, really cozy local pub feel to it. The duck sandwich was pretty good. The staff were not that friendly across the board, no one was rude or unprofessional its more like everyone was just a bit frosty (and not in a cool marine corp way). They only accept cash and debit, which was a bit annoying as I had no cash and did not want to use any of their machines. There was a sign on the door, but I did not see it, so it was my bad for not paying more attention. I plan to pay this place another visit to really make up my mind on it. Its got potential."}
{"text":"Meh.

I'm writing this review from the pub. it's ok. I think the hype about this place is simply the fact that this corner / area needed a decent pub, and the decor is nice.

My buddy ordered a high-end burbon. within a minute it had flies drowning in it. Server insisted it couldn't be replaced until we asked her to talk to the bartender and it was taken care of.

One reviewer said it has the best wings - I disagree. Only 2 flavours but can order hot sauce on side. Ordered well done and still came out soft. We were disappointed.

We nearly left but decided to give them a chance on mains. Again, meh. Fish and chips are standard, but at least the tartar sauce was homemade and good. Duck burger was dry even though was still pink. Server said it was 60% bacon but seemed like mostly beef. Hard to make a fatty bacon burger pink and dry.

May come back for a pint. Decent place for the area but there are many pubs within walking distance or a $10 cab ride that are far better and more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place specially in the summer. It is very cozy, and I love the setting and view of the streets. I ordered their burgers and fries on several occasions and it was fantastic every time. I saw some people ordering the brisket and it looked yummy too. Their drink menu and specially wine list is not expansive but the cozy atmosphere makes up for it."}
{"text":"This review below from 2015 completely summed up my experience.

\"This looks like a great little neighbourhood pub.  However, the bartender who greeted us had us hating the place within our first 60 seconds. His intention was to make sure he had the opportunity to maximize the revenue opportunity from each of his few tables. Fair enough. We were only staying for a few drinks and we would have been happy anywhere.  But the way he went about it left us feeling like we were vagrants trying to bed down in a corner booth. 

It's amazing how a few misspoken words can leave a lasting impression. I'm not going back.  EVER.\""}
{"text":"We came as tired duo looking for food in a winter cold. This place was a pleasant surprise. Lineup of drinks are good, but the food was not just the standard pub fare, it actually warms the soul. Curry Thursday cracks me up!"}
{"text":"Stopped in New Year's Eve on a whim while walking by. We ditched our previously bought and paid for plans to settle in here. East coast charm that welcomes you with open arms. You feel like you've been a patron forever and you're one of the family. Joey and Cherie have brought us a piece of Nova Scotia, and for that we say thank you."}
{"text":"Came here after a long lesllieville Pub crawl last Saturday. . It was freezing that night so we came to the Duck just to get away from the cold. It's a tiny place with a bit of a strange layout so we ended up sitting at these tiny tables facing out towards the aisle     
We just had whisky so I couldn't tell you about the food or the beer specials. 

Service was a bit brisk, but may have been because it was a Saturday night."}
{"text":"We've been watching this place prepare to open, and voila! It's here! Turns out it is owned by the same people who own Eastside Social, so that explains how smoothly things are going just one week after opening. The place was PACKED at 6:00. We got one of the last few available tables. The atmosphere is pub casual, and there's a great energy here. Full bar, but no cocktail menu yet. Lots of great beers, and three red, and three whites. For an appetizer we HAD to try the bread because I caught a whiff of a loaf walking in. It was VERY yummy :) For dinner we both chose the house special Thirsty Duck burger, and while I can't remember everything on it, it was huge and great. I do remember some aioli and crisy onions in there :) Overall we had a great meal and are thrilled to have this place so close to home!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and had an ok meal. My boyfriend had the fish and chips and the fries were excellent. He said the fish was good but the batter was so-so. I was excited to try the homemade hamburger helper, but was disappointed that the macaroni was so overcooked, it was like eating baby food."}

{"text":"Gluten-free review:

Please note that this review is targeted towards others who cannot consume gluten. If you can have gluten then you will not have a problem here and will have a great experience.

The gluten-free food options here are extremely limited. I was first told that I could have any sandwich without the bun, and after I put my order in I was later told that all their meats have breadcrumbs in them. Everything else was either battered and deep fried or had beer as an ingredient in the sauce. The fries are also a no-no because they're fried in the same vat as everything else. They don't make accommodations on their dishes (i.e. cornmeal covered fish and chips, baked/pan fried wings, etc.). What you see on their menu is what you get. 

I was then left to choose between two salads - the caesar salad (minus croutons) or the wedge salad. I went with the large caesar salad which was an ok size but definitely not worth $13. I left here hungry and stopped by another joint for food.  

As for drinks, they only had one cider and it was strongbow. There are so many great ciders, especially from Ontario, so it's a shame that is the only one they offer. I didn't ask about other gluten-free drinks, but I'm sure they have the usual drinks - rum and coke, house wines, etc. 

The other not so great things were:
- no lock on the bathroom stall door I used (not sure about the second stall)
- they keep the front door open so I kept having to shoo away flies from our food
- can't pay with credit card; only debit and cash  

Overall the atmosphere is great and the staff were very polite and attentive. For this positive aspect I'm giving them two stars instead of one. 

If you require a gluten-free meal, don't bother going here. If you want good food at roughly the same price point just go a few doors down to skin and bones."}
{"text":"Foods ok, but everything is overpriced considering that its just a pub....service is hit an miss depending on who's working as staff never seems the same....and no wifi!...."}
{"text":"Best donair I've had outside of Nova Scotia! Great atmosphere, and friendly staff. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great local ambience and the burgers are amazing. Opt for the 60/40 burger (60% ground brisket, 40% ground bacon) combined in a patty that must be 6 oz. Interesting toppings as well. I hear the duck leg (boneless meat) on a bun is worthwhile trying too."}
{"text":"This place just newly opened and I really wanted to try the East Coast inspired menu.  

The Brother's Pepperoni appetizer was so popular that they ran out when we arrived while the specials on the back of the menu placard were not ready to be primetime either.  I took this in stride as new restaurant openings can take some time to smooth out the wrinkles.

I ended up trying the duck burger with a salad as well as trying the homemade butter and bread.  The burger had a good amount of duck piled high accompanied by some pickled veg and a nicely toasted bun.  The burger was tasty and I am sold on it but I think it could've used something to give it a kick.  It is one of their most popular entrees at the moment.

I can already see that this place will become a favourite local spot for the neighbourhood.  They got some of the local craft beers on tap while keeping the atmosphere casual and jovial.

I think this place deserves another visit once they settle into the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Upon walking in at first glance, I saw a mix of young professionals and old school working class men hanging out at the bar. Been open a few months and already got a circle of tavern regulars, eh?

As if Leslieville/Queen East needs another pub, right? (At least that's the impression BlogTO wants to project of my hood from that \"10 signs you live in Leslieville\" list, eh?) This corner hole replaces the longtime Chinese restaurant Celline Garden in another chapter of... uh, ongoing \"neighbourhood change.\" Whereas the nearby Eastside Social (which I believe share the same owners) is more restaurant than pub, The Thirsty Duck is more pub than restaurant, though both share an upscale maritime menu theme. There seems to be less space here though than what I remember Celline Garden having, perhaps due to the front bar and kitchen taking up much of the real estate. Would like to see what a packed house looks like.

There is a respectable choice of beers and drinks, at decent prices. I don't know what justifies a $12 donair, but amongst the selection of the usual pub grub, the duck burger sure sounds enticing. The vibe here is greatly friendly from the moment you walk through the corner door. Perhaps more notable than the amount of TVs mounted throughout, is that they serve lunch every day--something you don't see much of along East Queen Street."}
{"text":"I work at Leslieville area & I always want to look for lunch options as most restaurants are close during weekdays.  The Thirsty Duck just opened this week & was already pack during lunch time.  Surprisingly food was fast & Joey's fish & chips was delicious!  Upgrade to sweet potato fries & you won't be disappointed!  Need to go back soon when they have the full beer menu & lunch special!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on what happened to be their 1-year anniversary so we lucked out on free beer! Yay! 

As a Maritimer, I have been craving donair since I moved to Toronto a billion years ago so I'm elated that I now have an outlet to satisfy that hunger! So to get to the point, the donair was decent. It didn't blow my mind (maybe it would taste better at 3am in Halifax after 18 rum and Cokes like the good ol days...) but it was tasty enough. What I can't understand is the $12 price tag. For that price, it should come with a salad or other side. 

My friend had the burger and it was pretty good. I loved the fries, but the gravy was a bit weird. 

The service was good overall. The bathrooms were a bit gross and the hospital grade soap was awful. Smelled so bad and strong that it interfered with the taste of my food when I got back from the bathroom. I hope they take some time to give that bathroom a good scrub and a fresh coat of paint would go a long way.

I would definitely go back to the Thirsty Duck - and would likely have the donair again, though the \"stuffing chowder\" sounds interesting. 

A few improvements and this place would be a gem."}
{"text":"After reading about this as a place with a Maritimes vibe, I brought two of my East coast friends here for dinner and drinks while watching the Jays game. Luckily the food and beverages were better than the Jays as they lost game 1 of the ALCS. 

We ordered fish and chips, beef ribs, and the chicken wings. Although tempted by the donair and plethora of duck dishes, we stuck to pretty traditional pub grub. The fries and ribs were the highlight. The ribs were big, meaty, and the sauce was a good combination of sweet and tangy. The fish and chips were also above average, although the specialty fish and chip shops (including Reliable down the street) are better. 

As this restaurant has recently opened, parts of their menu feature, \"coming soon\" signs. These include daily specials. I wish they'd ironed all that out before opening, as this didn't appear to be a soft opening (we weren't told as much either). 

We'll have to come back once they are 100% operational. We also have to try the donair."}
{"text":"Delish!
Had the duck sandwich, hubby had the burger - which, I should add, is 40% bacon! So good! Fries were super crispy and house cut. Service was friendly and inviting. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend and stopped by the Thirsty Duck on a whim. The staff are pleasant and the place has a cozy feel to it. I ordered the Donair and it was really good - I almost ordered a second one, truth be told. I would back and try the burgers - they looked good as they came out of the kitchen for others in the pub...

The prices were on par with most other pubs... Note: They only accept cash and/or debit (no credit)."}
{"text":"This is a great old school style pub/bar with really impressive food. The staff's great and there are a lot of good beers on tap like Goose Island.

The ribs are probably the best beef ribs I've ever had. It comes with two massive ribs and the meat falls of the bone. The fries which it comes with are great as well. This place has only been open a month but I've had the ribs 3 times already.

There are a couple tv's which show whatever sports are on. It's not really a place you'd go to to watch sports specifically as the TV's aren't huge and not all seats have a great view, but that's not what this place is about really.

One thing that's kind of funny, when you're not tall, is the basement bathroom ceilings. The ceilings are the lowest I've seen for a bathroom and at 5'10 my head touches it in places."}
{"text":"Finally got around to checking this place out. Decided to come here for dinner before heading out to a concert. Despite a Jays game being on& being packed, they had space to accommodate us.

I got the fish & chips. These were amazing. Perfectly cooked fish, crispy on the outside & tender on the inside. The chips were delicious as well. I got the Brickhouse cider as well. Which they serve in a big mason jar. 

My boyfriend got the donair. He's from the east coast & said it was one of the best. It was so good I couldn't even sneak a bite lol.

Overall, we will definitely return. The food came out within a reasonable time. The staff was great, even if it was a busy game night.

They did however lose a point because the back room we were seated in was a little dingy. It was covered in spiderwebs."}
{"text":"We're all for supporting restaurants in our neighborhood, but when you order fish & chips and ask for condiments (mayo) and then made you feel like it was a huge inconvenience and charged extra for it - that doesn't bode too well in my books. I would much rather go to Prohibition Gastro Pub or the Roy and get service with a smile and free mayo!!!"}
{"text":"The Thirsty Duck opened in the fall.  It's named for a Halifax (Nova Scotia) bar that the owners/spouses, Joey Skeir and Cherie Stinson, used to go to.  I'm originally from Nova Scotia and it's been on my radar.

Gord and I had supper there this evening.

The place was jammed when we got there so we sat at the bar.  One of the owners, Joey Skeir, was there for a while and we had a nice chat.  I also chatted with the bartender, Andrew.  He looked really familiar to me and it turns out he and I went to high school together in Cape Breton.  Small world!

Gord and I started with Fried Pepperoni.  It had a nice spice.

We both ordered Joey's Fish and Chips. Skeir's dad previously owned a fish and chip shop in Halifax.  The batter was light and crisy and wasn't greasy at all.  It was a big portion of fish and it was delicious.  Neither of us were able to finish our fries since we focused on the fish.  We'd get it again.

It's a cute pub and we wish it was in our 'hood ... alas, it's a 45 minute streetcar ride away from home.  As a head's up, they only accept cash and debit."}
{"text":"Joey's fish n chips are the lick. Crunchy fresh golden goodness that melts in your mouth, especially when homemade gravy is involved. The Thirsty Duck serves up east coast inspired dishes and amazing pub food. Everything is delicious, from the duck sammie to the donair to (my favourite) the fish n chips. Owners Joey and Cherie are the best."}
{"text":"First, I want to clarify I just came for a few beers. The food did look incredible and I'm going to come back soon, taste it and update my review with a full experience.

Having said that, my first experience wasn't good. Beer was unbearably flat and the amount of fruit flies was distracting. Very distracting.

The place is cozy however and I love the decor. Also the layout is very smart. And people are friendly.

I do want to come back and try the food though. It looked really good. I'll also update if the fruit fly situation was a one time thing or not."}
{"text":"I called here this afternoon to see if I could make reservations and the woman on the phone was very curt and informed me that they don't take reservations but I should have no problems getting a table for dinner. I wasn't inspired by her tone, but I figured hey, she may just be really busy, so let's give the place a shot. As it turns out, there were tables. This place is pretty small, but the layout must be effective as it does not feel cramped.  I decided to go with the donair with a side of fries. The portion size of the fries was huge! I ended up taking 2/3 home.  They were very well cooked and seasoned. The donair meat was good, but I found the sauce too sweet for my liking. My friend had fish and chips and theh looked well prepared too. Our server was very attentive and she checked back regularly to see if the food was to our liking and if we needed more drinks. All in all, I enjoyed my meal and my visit here."}
{"text":"This is one of my \"go-to's\" in Leslieville. Andrew and all the staff are very welcoming, and you feel like you pick up where you left off each time you go! 

I will say that the food is not really my cup of tea. I'm not huge on meat, and there aren't too many alternatives. Their homemade bread and butter is to die for though, so the trade-off is okay with me.

Overall, stop by for a Millstreet Organic! Very cozy and enjoyable, especially in the winter. :)"}
{"text":"Really good food in a cosy little pub.

Went on a Sunday at lunch for Doner and a burger. The food was really good! Service was a touch slow, but that's because they were understaffed. The server was really busy but still excellent, she was a total professional and I was really impressed.

I had the duck burger, and it was delish! I got mine with salad and everything was really tasty and cooked (and seasoned) perfectly.

The only thing, if you're over 5'8\", try to avoid the washrooms. They're in the basement, which apparently was made for Oompa Loompas. But that's the worst thing I can say about the visit, honestly! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Maybe the best donair ever.  Actually for sure the best.  Sorry Halifax :(  The duck sandwich is approved by Ildiko and she doesn't mess around!"}
