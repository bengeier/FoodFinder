{"text":"Ohhh! Jimmy!!! With your sweet, savory cakes, you make my mouth water...How I miss those tiles on your sweet little blue tiles on those sweet little tables, and taking my best friend in there long ago. She moved to South Korea, since. Goodbye, old faithful friend (not her, Jimmy's!).  Only bad memory I have is, my friend and I were severely scolded when bringing in our \"Arabica\" (which used to be located right down the street) styrofoam coffee mugs in there.  Bottom line: An awesome place to get good fries with ketchup, and all manner of wines. Oh, well, too bad. No one will be having their food anymore :_)."}
{"text":"Ah, Jimmy's.  After every performance down the street at Kalliope, this is where I am.  And the only place I'll really consider.  It's my Cleveland bar.  Laid back, never completely too crowded, and not really noisy.  The staff are your friends, or become your friends, they make a good drink, and I believe, for a brief amount of time, there was even a kimmy drink... ..to have a drink named after you is pretty damn cool. anyways, not only do they do the alcohol not too shabby (martinis, blue moon, cosmos, or my personal favorite, a \"mark on the beach\", named after mark, one of the bartenders)...but they have great food too.  the salads are to die for. huge. healthy.  and a perfect balance to your guiness. :) if you're in the mood for dessert, do not pass go until you have a piece of the beet cake.  yes.  that says beet.  i hate beets.  but this is a chocolatey piece of heaven.  gooey, moist.. wow. those are two words i really don't want to use to describe anything ever again. but it's good. and once jimmy gave me new directions home which were much faster than the route i was taking.  see.  they are cool people.  and that's why you should go to jimmy's. just don't take our table.  or i'll have to punch you in the face. :)"}
{"text":"Every time I step into Jimmy O'Neill's I think \"Now THIS is a tavern.\" I feel like I've walked onto a set built for some period piece about sailors about to travel across the pond. The dining area is moody and twinkle light filled and most anyone would describe ti as cute. I love the atmosphere of the tavern, and if you're an Amy follower you'll know that's what I put before almost anything else (exception being cleanliness). I'd love to give the tavern 5 stars just for creating a romantic experience. However, I need to be realistic. You come to a tavern to eat and drink. In the food and bev department, my experience has been about average. Nothing really looks that great on the menu and from what I've tasted, it isn't. I think you can have a really great time at Jimmy O'Neill's Tavern, just set your expectations accordingly. The draw is the mood, not the food."}
{"text":"Jimmy O'Neils has consistently excellent and affordable food presented in a casual but classy tavern setting. I've never had a dissatisfying meal here. The chocolate beet cake is a great way to end any of your meals at Jimmy's."}
{"text":"Jimmy O'Neill's is your friendly, neighborhood tavern.  The main reason I come to Jimmy O'Neill's is to treat visitors and guests to their famous beet cake. I was introduced by some \"long-time\" Clevelanders (Case alumni who are familiar with the homey magic of Lee Rd) and it's definitely one of those hometown hangout spots.   Food & drink: Let me tell you - their beet cake is AMAZING! It sounds crazy, but it's extremely delicious. It's a warm chocolate cake with beet baked into it (you can barely taste it) with some ice cream (or is it whipped cream?) on the side. It melts in your mouth.   Atmosphere: This is a great place to go if you want an intimate celebration. There are Christmas lights everywhere and in some ways it feels like an old school European tavern. The waitstaff is amazing - especially the owner who always wears a Hawaiian shirt. He is so kind.  People watching: You'll see some Cleveland characters too. I think once there was a group of elderly carolers or a capella folks (?)  Note: This is not a sports bar! Once I came here to watch a Cavs game and the bar (at the time) was a little too quiet to appropriately hoot and holla."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you want to eat. I've tried the food here on several occasions, each time thinking the next will be better. I want to like this restaurant since it's in my back yard. The food is always mediocre and bland. The beet cake tastes like grocery store microwave brownies.   The owner has some type of grouchy Jack Nicholson schtick that isn't working and makes it seem like you're hassling him every time you order food.   The only good thing I can say about this place is the other bartender I've dealt with was nice and they have Oban, though they overcharge for it."}
{"text":"I like this place and come here with friends often. I haven't had the same negative experiences with the food that the other reviewers apparently have had, though I usually stick to the sandwiches.  The draw for me is more the atmosphere than the food. It's low-key, uncrowded, and Jimmy is friendly. A good place to go with friends in the evening."}
{"text":"We went there for my father's birthday last night.  The menu seems bizarre based on the decor, but the food was very good!  What puts this up to 4 stars for me was the wait staff and atmosphere.   It was my father's birthday last night, so I (of course) awkwardly started singing \"Happy Birthday\" when we got our dessert.  Before I was even mid way through the song, the waiter had shown up with a candle, and joined in on the singing.  It was very thoughtful.   Though it sounds weird, try to Beet Cake (tastes just like sweet chocolate cake).  It is amazing! They serve it warm with home made whipped cream....mmmmmm good."}
{"text":"This place is good. The price is very reasonable. Very good wings, salads, burgers, bread, and the entrees are very good. The beet cake is to die for. The service is very friendly, Go there any night. This is one place that cooks a burger how you want it."}
{"text":"Step one: Go there with an old friend for a beer.  Step two: Look around, notice it is pretty empty, sit down at the bar and laugh.  Step three: Get a few beers and chat with the bartender who enters into your conversation without being overbearing -- but he also happens to have the bartender-sixth-sense to know when to leave you alone for a while.  Step four: Sum it up -- it is a local place, owned by the same guy for twelve years. He is fun, cares about the place and it shows. Its nothing special, but the service was amazing and more than made up for it."}
{"text":"I really hate giving someplace a 1-star. I really tried to give it two. The beet cake, as others have said, is quite good but unless you go there just to eat that, I don't see why anyone should eat here. I really cannot think of a time when I've paid for a more disgusting meal.   I ordered some comfort food - roasted 1/2 chicken with rice pilaf and carrots on the side. Honestly, the chicken was so rubbery it was just beyond nasty. The rice had DEFINITELY been microwaved - it tasted exactly like it does when I heat up leftover rice pilaf at home. Not necessarily gross but definitely not what I want when eating out. The baby carrots had also been microwaved - if they were any mushier, they could have passed for baby food.  By the time the beet cake that my husband ordered came, I really had no more appetite but I did think it was pretty good. The meal was 14-ish bucks too so it was definitely an overall FAIL.   I wanted to like this place becuase it seemed homey and it's right in my backyard but I just couldn't eat any of my meal. I hope for their sake, it was just a 'bad night' although I don't really believe in those. Sorry Jimmy, I'm sticking with the Pub next door."}
