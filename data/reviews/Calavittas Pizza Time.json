{"text":"Today was the first time I tried Calavittas Pizza and I was very pleased!!  Thanks to Yelp I would have never found this pizza place if it wasn't for the on-line deal that you were doing with them."}
{"text":"Really yummy pizza. One of my favorite places to order from. 
And the owner is so friendly. Every time you see him he treats you like a long lost friend. 
The only complaint I have is that sometimes the crust is rather dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Good guys good pizza

First time crust could have been better sauce was good cheese bread was best"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Best pizza around. I highly recommend the buffalo chicken ranch. Add banana peppers! Trust me! Really friendly staff, pizza has always been delivered hot. Awesomeness"}
{"text":"Great pizza, wings and service. Owners and employees treat you like family. We drive past half dozen or more other pizza shops for Calavittas it's that good. Great specials coupons and promos too. Dine in, carry out and delivery is available."}
{"text":"They put it together right. Sausage and meatball bake was a pleasant surprise, great buffalo wings."}
{"text":"We visited Pizza Time last week to pick up a large ham & pineapple pizza. It was delicious & very filling! We ate it again the next day for leftovers and it still tasted great. And David is a really nice guy. He cares a lot about his customers & tries to have the best customer service possible, which is always great when you're eating at a local place."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and the best customer service I've ever had in a pizza place. Very friendly and inviting. I tried the Tuscan pizza and it was amazing and fresh and I could not have asked for better, the prices are not bad either which was nice but it would be worth paying much more for pizza of this caliper. If you are in town definitely stop by here."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews tried it once I'm sure that will be the last time did not like the pizza at all, there are much better pizza places in Lake County thank God for that"}
{"text":"What a find! We were greeted warmly and the owner was excited to see that we had found Calavitta's Pizza Time through Yelp. Checked in for some free cheesy bread and used our 15-for-20 to order a medium Brogan and a medium chicken and pineapple. The owner told us he was going to knock it out of the park for us and he did! Seriously, the pizza was/is (I'm writing this mid-meal I'm so pleased) fantastic. Crust is perfect, not too doughy. High quality cheeses, sauce, and toppings make this pie among my all-time favorites (and I'm originally from New Haven, CT -- the birthplace of Apizza). Best of all it was made by a guy who was genuinely nice and clearly in love with what he does. Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on a road trip. Loved our spinach and mushroom pizza. Great crust and sauce. Friendly owner. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Good Pizza.  The dough was fresh and the sauce was great.  The mozz sticks were nothing special.  Nice people."}
{"text":"The pizza is about average. Nothing special.

They also didn't give us the correct flavor wings with our order. Taste-wise wings were standard."}
{"text":"Everything about my experience was above and beyond what I could expect from anywhere. I saw the bumper sticker a few times and always wondered where it was located. The other day I passed it and vowed to try it, but I forgot. Tonight I came to Yelp and looked up 'Delivery' and it was there, even though it was a city about 10 minutes away. 

I called them and was greeted by the happiest and most pleasant man ever. If I repeated everything he said it would sound like a sales pitch, but there was a sincerity in his voice. I called the first time to ask if they delivered to my area, being quite further than I would expect them to, and the man responded with a 'yes' but there was nothing but happiness in his voice. I called back a second time since I hadn't yet looked at the menu.

He said he was the manager and founder, but again not in a pretentious way. I hung up and said to my husband 'I feel like this amount of passion about your food speaks volumes'. I was not disappointed! They had a special for 2 large specialty pizzas for $20, and then he added that we could get any side for $3. He allowed me to be put on hold to peruse the sides. We ended up with 6 wings for only $3! They came with plenty of sauce (a rarity) and they were HUGE. 

It was such a positive experience, especially because I began it with a high expectation. I will absolutely get a pizza from them again, and try their pasta! We go to dives when we go out, but I will likely shell out the extra $5 to get theirs over other places. Management is key! 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"We first fount out about Pizza Time after getting an offer from Restaurant.com, and I am glad we did. The owner Dave is super friendly. We called in an order and got there early, needless to say the kids got thirsty. We were going to purchase a bottle of water, however he gave it to them and said it was on him. The pizza is fantastic, we have had the Hawaiian pizza and the veggie pizza and they both were delicious, oh and the cinnamon sticks are mouth watering. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great pizza and really nice employees! We just tried this place for the first time tonight and were very impressed! Ordering was a pleasure as Nathan, who took the order, was super nice and extremely polite. Great online deal/coupon and I just had to mention it and it was applied. Pizza was ready when we arrived. I really was impressed with how friendly everyone was. Got our pizza home and it was delicious! Good ingredients and loved the sweetness in the pizza sauce. Thank you Calavittas!"}
{"text":"Pizza was fantastic...we ate in the restaurant and our calzone came out a little late which was not an issue and the manager gave us gift cards to make up for it.

Great food, great customer service"}
{"text":"Visiting Ohio and needed pizza, and so lucky to have found this place! The herbs and spices this guy puts on his pizza are incredible! I've never had anything like it! He mentioned opening a place in my home state.. PLEASE CONSIDER ARLINGTON TEXAS!  incredible flavor.. keep doing what you're doing!!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten their pizza but I have been there 3 times and got the meatball calzone cause it's good. One of these days I'll get a pizza and revise my review. So if you want a calzone try the meatball one. Friendly owner and staff."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place last year heading back from visiting family. Badass bitchin za with a kick ass owner. Stopped again this year when we realized we were in Mentor by chance for a second year in a row. Mentor means pizza time, baby."}
{"text":"I ordered from here for the first time last night after 11 when another pizzeria place or two decided they were union and weren't interested in working late. I ordered a Hawaian pizza from here and hoped the other reviews were true. I couldn't be happier. Not only did a cheerful delivery girl named Emily deliver my pizza quickly, but when she started to get lost I talked her in via phone and she was very positive. 
The pizza itself was a standard Hawaian, however, they added something to the crust. I think it was cinnamon, but I'm not sure. Whatever it was it made the pizza taste amazing. I'll order pizza here again. Late delivery, friendly service, and wonderful taste to boot."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We dined in and everyone in this place was very happy and nice! The pizza is the best pizza I've had in ohio. The cheesy bread is wonderful as well. Spent around 25 bucks on a large Sicilian white pizza with cheesy bread and three cans of pop. Had plenty to take home too! We will be back! If you haven't heard of this place, try it!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza place! We found this gem just days after its opening while we were traveling from Erie, PA and let me say, it is the best! I love the Sicilian pizza -- def a favorite. Seeing the owner tossing the dough that day on the street was the best thing for me and my husband!  Now, we stop by every time we are in town!"}
{"text":"The place was filled with smoke when we first entered. Then we ordered... 25 minutes later the guy comes out to ask us to clarify what toppings we would like on our pizza!! They scream for their crew members so it sounds like you are interrupting a fight in the back... Our food took 45 minutes to come out and NO ONE else was here. I do have to say the food was very good. But we weren't given plates or anything to eat with in store.. My suggestion would be to order food to pick up. Solves all problems."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and 15 minutes for delivery!!!! (6 minute drive) We call and hear \"we got backed up...doing our best\".  So we were given the option. Pick it up in 10 or we'll try again in 15.  Stouffer's French Bread pizza it is. Very disappointing and they don't care"}
{"text":"The pizza and cheesey sticks have no right to be as good as they are for as cheap as they are."}
{"text":"This review is difficult to do because the pizza here is so good that there's no way to properly describe it.

If you're in the area and you order pizza that isn't from here, you screwed up.  Plain and simple.  If you're considering ordering pizza, the correct answer is a specialty pizza from Calavittas.  If you have no interest in pizza, I want to know what's wrong with you."}
{"text":"Always loved their food kind of got bumpy on service and quality but them again maybe was a busy period for them but as always judge for your self never take others comments as solid"}
{"text":"Extremely delicious pizza. I usually don't eat pizza crusts, but I ate every bite here! Get the Sicilian White Pizza and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a local and was very happy with the service and the pie!! We got a large pep, banana pepper and mushroom pizza with ten wings and a salad for $25ish. Got a free cheesy bread with a yelp promo too!! Everything was perfect temp even for delivery and was right on the expected delivery time. Crust must be homemade because it was amazing. I didn't ask for the garlic crust topping but will next time!! I guess the wings are oven baked, can't confirm but tasted great. Can't go wrong with BBQ. Will try another flavor next time. Lots of \"next times\" being thrown out with this review! Salad was crisp and fresh. Had crusted blue cheese on the side. I love it but if you don't I'm sure this would be a nice gesture. Very happy. Look forward to trying something new. Maybe a Calzone!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. 

I just moved to the area and have been trying all the local \"recommendations\"...no one pointed this place out to me and to be honest, all the others I've had have been...meh. 

I found this place on Yelp, took a shot and am sure glad I did!

The quality of pizza you get is truly impressive. Add to it that the owner works his tail off and is a great guy to boot and you can't beat it. The food is clean as is the location. They are friendly and knowledgable about your food! It's pizza, I get it, but it's great pizza. Our kids are VERY VERY picky and they ALL raved about it, couldn't get enough of it and we agree.

 You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't give this place a try. 

They have all organic ingredients used fresh daily, have all your normal toppings and pizza styles (including thin crust) but also expand into creative concoctions as well (Cinnamon butter crust anyone?). Their Cheesy bread is also outstanding...

Honestly, give them a try...you won't regret it. They are our new go-to!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!!!  i don't do corporate chains and i've tried about every local pizza shop in the area, Calavitta's wins hands down for freshness, quality, texture and flavor!!! the wings are huge and delicious, salad was awesome...very fresh with lots of yummy toppings and the staff couldn't have been any more friendly, all around great place for everyone to enjoy with a nice selection of menu choices"}
{"text":"Loved this place! 11 of us stopped in during a road trip headed home to Boston, MA. We ordered several sandwiches, a large cheese pizza and a small meatball pizza. I had the Sicilian white sandwich and it was delicious! Everyone else loved their sandwiches and pizza. The best part was the Garlic butter and Parmesan crust on the large cheese pizza. 
   On the way home we Snacked on the small meatball pizza and it was great, even cold (it's a long drive to Boston!). 
    The guys behind the counter were super friendly and really helpful with the menu, even though some of us were pretty grumpy travelers! 
I wish this place was closer to home, but if I'm ever back in Ohio I will definitely stop back in here! 
LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and the staff is amazing as well as the owner greeted us and talked with us for a bit. My daughter for the Italian wedding soup which was homemade and amazing as well. We loved there pizza and the crust of the pizza. Definitely better then any chain restaurant around here !!!!! This place deserves five stars for the food, service, and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Pizza has an amazing crust. The only reason it did not earn 5 stars was because of the atmosphere. Restaurant had a bunch of broken down stuff (oven, soda fountain, etc). But the food is TERRIFIC."}
{"text":"Ok, this place may have incredible food. However,

It's a very confusing place! Poor signage. Inside AND out. Pizza oven set out in sitting area. ZERO visible menu signage. Tables in disarray, looks like someone is moving out. No sign that says \"under construction, pardon we don't look organized\" 

Outside signage doesn't show their name clearly at all. 

Guys behind small counter look like they have it together...but hilariously seemed baffled at my confusion over why their place looks in disarray and we were looking for the menu. 

Guys...put some tables out and a sign on the wall. You might have food down, but man, people from other places have zero clue what's happening in there."}
{"text":"We tried it for the first time last night (Friday 6/27/2014). We had the PT Supremo and All Meats Classico specialty pizzas.  Excellent pizza!  

I read all the good reviews but was still a little skeptical.  But I can confirm now, that Calavittas Pizza Time really does sell a great product!  Organic ingredients.  Fresh taste.  Lightly sweet sauce is delicious!

The owner was there when I walked in.  Very friendly, nice guy!  

We will DEFINITELY order from here often!"}
{"text":"They are so nice, and luckily deliver to where we live in Kirtland.  Food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My family recently moved to the Mentor area and have been checking out various restaurants to see which ones will become our regular stops. We'll, we found our pizza place! Calavitta's offers the closest thing I've had to New York style pizza since I moved from New York 20 years ago. Their delectable blend of cheeses mixes perfectly with the slightly sweet sauce. The crust is soft and airy with just a hint of crunch at the edge, but sturdy enough to bear the weight of the generous amounts of cheese and toppings on it. And their cheesy bread... Mama Mia! Good stuff, just gooey enough and lightly seasoned to really bring out the cheesy goodness. Great job, guys! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for pizza pickup/delivery in the Mentor/Willoughby area.  Very fun staff that's young and energetic.  The Pizza was awesome!  It really tasted like no other pizza I have ever had before.  I will be returning I am sure!"}
{"text":"This pizza does not disappoint!  We consider ourselves to be pizza experts and I will tell you, there is not a better pizza to be found in Lake County than this pizza.  The sauce is sweeter and the dough is fantastic.  We have also found their \"Amazing Sandwiches\" to be nameworthy.  I would recommend the Meatball one.  Also, under specialty pizzas, the Bacon BBQ is not to be missed.

The customer service is great as well!  Super friendly and attentive to make sure that each order is perfect!"}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and the night snuck up on my girlfriend and I (we aren't used to the 9pm daylight thing) so we went looking for something to eat. The reviews looked good, and pizza is a good fall back pretty much always so we gave it a shot.

The place seemed slow when we got there at round 9pm (but it's a pizza joint so that can be deceiving since I assume most of the business is delivery. ) The girl up front took our order and said it would be about 20 minutes - seemed reasonable. 20 minutes came and went, and the girl went home for the night at around 930 after instructing her to stop taking phone orders. Another customer came in around 930 and was chatting with the now lone cook.  He talked about how the day had been pretty slow and how they had more staff then needed most of the day. I mention this because if you tell customers it was a slow day then they assume their orders will be ready quickly... not the case. At this point he started turning new customers away. Around 945 our order was done. Yay! 

Item 1: Small Texas BBQ pizza. Bland bland bland. The crust was like cardboard, the sauce tasted store bought, which honeslty is fine, but there wasn't enough to over come the crust, and the toppings were flavorless. Even the bacon wasn't enough to save it.

Item 2: Steak Sandwich: the \"bread\" is more of the really bad crust. The steak was flavorless meat. 

Item 3: Parmesan Garlic wings. Again...bland. It tasted like they fried some wings, tossed them around in butter and then dumped some of the Parmesan packets on them. I couldn't taste a hint of garlic or any other seasoning.

I'm not sure if it was just a bad night or if this there is just a lack of good pizza in the area but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Amazing! We tried their pizza and their chicken parm bake. The food was great and the staff was friendly. They are in our top 3 list for pizza now. We ate in and used their best china, paper plates and plastic forks and knives! No matter because the food was so good. We will be back, but may opt for delivery or takeout. It was a fun first experience on a snowy Friday night."}
{"text":"First time trying it out tonight and the pizza was excellent!  Nice young man who happened to be the owner as well took care of me. I will definitely go back and give the local family my business. Give it a try, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Willoughby Hills, but we still get our pizza from here. PT is the best pizza because they only use the best imported ingredients. The sauce is magical- when we order pizza we always get triple sauce. The Hawaiian pizza is made heavenly by the cinnamon sugar crust sprinkled on after the pie comes out of the oven. 
My husband and I have very different tastes, and PT never has a problem making 1/2 or 1/3 pizzas different (ex- no onions on 1/2). And they've never messed it up. They even mark on the box which side is which.
I'm happy to support a local business, & even happier when it's owned by such a great person. The owner, Dave, is a goofy guy who loves what he does. 
Love their pizza, but they also have great sandwiches, wings, & calzones. Sooo good."}
{"text":"What's great about this pizza place is the fact that they deliver and are open until midnight. I ordered delivery from here while stopping in Mentor on a road trip. What a satisfying and cheap meal to have after driving 16 hours. The pizza wasn't huge but we got a large so the XL is probably a good enough size for 2-3 people. There are several specialty pizzas available as well as a bunch of toppings to chose from. The price was great, two pizzas and breadsticks for about $20. The delivery came pretty quickly and both the person I talked to on the phone and the delivery man were very friendly."}
{"text":"Not sure where all the high praise is coming from about this establishment. We ordered delivery and weren't impressed by any of our food items. First of all, we received our order an hour and 5 minutes after being placed. We selected a couple of different pizzas and the cheesy bread. Nothing stood out as even being very good. Just average, at best."}
{"text":"Yum!!! We love a non chain place.  Very friendly owner. Highly recommend chicken ranch specially pizza.  Tons of chicken, cheese and red hot!  The crust was ridiculous!  
Pepperoni and mushroom was great too. The cheese is quality!  Right off of I90, so easy to get to.  We live on the other side of town, but we will be stopping on our way by."}
