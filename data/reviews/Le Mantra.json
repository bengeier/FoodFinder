{"text":"I've heard some talk about this place so decided to give it a try for their lunch buffet. First of all, if you go for the lunch buffet make sure you get there by 12:45 latest if you want to try all the selections (there are a lot.) Items run out and very few get replenished.  The food is \"ok\" for the fact that the resto is situated in Longueuil. It is your basic Indian catering, nothing to be wowed about and everything is cooked bland to cater to the French Canadian palate.  They have a lot of vegetarian selection in the buffet which is good. Meat selection was limited to 1 beef curry and a mild and spicy version of a butter chicken. The spicy version was bland!! Didn't bother to try the mild version. Honestly this place is serviceable but nothing special. Don't go out of your way unless you live in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food. Authentic and tasty. The owner is present and she is charming. Quiet for supper. Traditional french neighborhood that probably doesn't appreciate this type of food. Cultural shock if your looking for pizza or subs. Large portions and fresh. Nothing prepared in advance here. Tacky decor but who cares. Reasonably priced. This is our third visit. We are working our way down the menu. Recommend"}
{"text":"Les plats sont excellent. Un restaurant Indiens des meilleurs de Longueuil. L'apparence du bâtiment ne porte pas confiance mais les plats sont excellent. Le service manque de personnelle; deux serveurs c'est pas assez. J'ai passé presque 2 heure."}
{"text":"Most of the food was not good. I usely go to indian restaurant and I'm satisfied but this restaurant changed my satisfaction. The rice was dry, not tasty. The dessert was out of date, we didn't eat  the dessert. On the other hand, the tea was refreshing. Me and my friend thought that the food was not cooked today but from yesterday night. They just heat the food so that's the reason the food was not good because it was not fresh. It's better to go at night and not at noon during the buffet."}
{"text":"I ordered twice from here, we decided to go with a combo for 2 and called to have it delivered. It was on the expensive side but it was worth it as we received a lot of food !! All the food was flavorful, we enjoyed the chicken butter & chicken pakoras etc. If you're into trying something different, you may want to try this restaurant."}
