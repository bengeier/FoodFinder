{"text":"Great restaurant and friendly staff, I have visited here 3 times the last week on a row and I was very happy with the food however they lack some speed with taking order and actually bringing the food but overall it was a pleasant restaurant and definitely a must visit!  I recommend to get the beef with garlic and the whole grilled fish ! amazing :D  You get what you pay for ( get the all you can eat !)  Cheers, Ehsan"}
{"text":"I've been to Yellowtail 3 times now and each time the food quality has regressed. The sashimi was warm and were not fresh. The spicy salmon items tasted very artificial and just ... bad. Hot food did not have much flavour and was at best ordinary. Maki and hand rolls were okay relative to other items on the menu.    Although the food ranged from mediocre to bad, they had excellent customer service Overall, I would not recommend trying the food at Yellowtail when considering the several other options for AYCE sushi in the GTA."}
{"text":"The service here is good, I came there with nobody in store. A start is for service only.   However, I was very disappointed in food. What they offer is totally different from picture.   This is the first time I ordered a bento box with spring rolls & fried dumplings (instead of shrimp & vegetables). The garlic is died, some of them is black, and hard to eat.   The straw is pretty thin, which is really hard to drink. I believe it's good for their AYCE customer. Before I leave, I even did not finish half of my iced tea. But it's okay.  They do have high-chair; however, the seat-belt is broken. I need to put my hands on it to make sure my baby will not fall down during movement. M not sure this restaurant is child friendly or not.  The bill includes 10% service charge. I still give about 14% extra because their service is really good, fast & friendly.   Will not come back again!"}
{"text":"DISHONEST by adding service charge to party of 2!!  We visited Yellowtail yesterday - the good was good, but our experience considerably soured when we got the bill.  A +10% service charge before tax for a party of TWO people?!  Are you kidding me?  I can understand if we were a party of eight or more, but adding +10% to EVERY bill is misleading and dishonest.  If you want to add +10% to the meals, then add it into the prices of the dishes.  It's dishonest to add a tiny line at the end of the menu.  It completely ruined our experience and we will not return."}
{"text":"Yellowtail opened up not too long ago and I am happy to have a sushi place near my house that serves yummy sushi.  There all you can eat is average price. I don't know much of the sushi terminology cause my husband always orders for us but I will tell you this:  The sashimi leaves something to be desired. It just feels like its not cut right. Anything with spicy salmon or crispy and spicy in the name, SHOULD be ordered. Delicious. Everything else he orders is always good.  So as I don't really like sashimi to begin with, I am REALLY happy with Yellowtail. Great service, good atmosphere, and always busy. Might wanna consider making a reservation for weekend nights.  :)"}
{"text":"Decor is rather generic but I guess we came for the food so it goes.  Overall food was very good. Our ladies where quite happy with everything. Sashimi was fresh though cut rather small, not quite the proper slice of fish but then it is AYCE so just have to dip quicker in the soya sauce lol. Tempura is crispy and soup and udon are all made well. Beef as in beef ribs, cubes, rolls, skewers all very good quality. We really liked the beef ribs.  Service was great by mostly the young lady until the point when we got the bill.  The older lady was refusing our coupon we found through RFD clipdeals and almost made us feel like we made up the coupon as they never authorized such a coupon and only approved ones printed in flyers and not online for self print. She even made claims that maybe it's for another yellowtail upon which my friend pointed out the printed address.  I wasn't upset but the ladies well..... And you don't want to do that ...... I didn't want to ruin the evening over a few $$ so asked her to see what she can do. In the end this is our first time and this coupon did help her land our business this time and possibly future ones. She eventually came back and gave it to us.  We are likely to make this our gotto AYCE Japanese until we find a better one. It's just hard to justify coming here when our kid turns 4 and has to start paying $17 instead of $4 and she is NOT a good eater at all."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food, and the service was excellent. Definitely deserves a higher rating on yelp!"}
{"text":"The service was warm and welcoming the moment my husband and I walked through the door. We were immediately seated and served drinks. When we placed our orders they always came very quickly! We ordered salmon sushi, sashimi, mussels in sake, some tempura, several maki rolls and ramen. The sushi was very fresh and I would even say on par with some of the nicer a la carte restaurants we've been to. Everything we ordered was delicious!   What really impressed us besides the food was the friendly staff. They were always quick to remove our empty platters and also replaced our dishes with clean ones halfway through our meal. I also watched them clean a booth of the customers that had recently left, and they are very thorough, going as far as pulling the whole table out of the booth to wipe up thoroughly and sweep the floor.   The price is very competitive with other AYCE sushi places in the area and we will definitely keep this restaurant as one of our first choices. Thank you for a wonderful dinner!"}
{"text":"-Great food at lunch -Nice website with all pertinent info -Attentive service  Why would someone give them a lower review?! Are ppl expecting handjobs with their handrolls?!  The sushi/rolls were great with not too much rice. The miso soup was excellent, ditto for the ice cream  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends for their all-you-can-eat menu. Their sushi is the freshest I've ever tasted!! Their wait staff doesn't always speak the best English, but they are helpful to find the answers if they are unsure. It's my go-to sushi place! Go!! You will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Food is good. Customer service is excellent.  The owner Anne trains her staff to be courteous and efficient.  The food always comes quick,  even when it is busy. My wife and I usually have sashimi, rolls, tempura, and chicken teriyaki.  All food is prepared well.  Above average for an ayce place.  Again the staff understand service.  Ex:  if we order two chicken teriyakis, the server will put one by me and one by my wife.  Unlike many other ayce joints that will just dump the food onto any free space.  Only place I know that changes plates between courses.  It's the little details that make a difference. I also go with my coworkers with anywhere from 4 to 16 people.  No problem for Anne and her staff.  Foods always great and is delivered promptly. Tip:  Make a reservation before going to ensure no wait time and a good seat"}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times since they opened and until now. They are better than most ayce places simply because of the selection of food and they would update their menu to suit the patron's taste more. Such as adding in grilled pineapple to their list. It's my usual spot to go to when my family feels like ayce sushi. It's the best quality you can get for all you can eat. $23.99 for weekend dinner. They auto add 10% service charge, not sure about larger groups."}
{"text":"Decided to try Yellowtail since I still haven't found a good sushi place in the area and I wanted sushi and was lazy to go to Scarborough. The service was really good, very attentive- they noticed whenever our drinks needed refills. Didn't enjoy any of the makis, handrolls, sushi - rice was way too mushy. The salmon sashimi was not bad - standard. The ramen and udon were disappointing - both noodles were too soft and the soup base was tasteless. After tasting one bite of the udon - I found a fly in the soup - the waitress was very apologetic but lost the opportunity to make me feel better. For AYCE, the deep fried scallops were not bad. Have to say - I won't return, the bill came up to $56 for two people and for that price, I rather eat at a pricier japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"I went for their weekday lunch AYCE Japanese.  The selections were sparse.  Common items like Green Dragon rolls were not available during lunch.  The good news is the quality of food was great.  The salmon and mackerel sushi were fresh.  The skewers were plentiful and tasty.  The service was slow because they were understaffed.  Could be a problem if you're in a hurry.  I'm conflicted whether I like Yellowtail or not.  I think I'll be back but it won't be my go to AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"Gave it a shot for lunch- as usual, AYCE Sushi give you far too much rice, so I peeled a couple salmon leaving 2 clumps of rice. Within minutes, the manager came and asked if I was planning on eating the rice and I told her no. She then laid out policy that I would be charged the dinner premium. I told her we would never return- she didn't care.  In the end, they charged me $2 for the extra rice. I won't ever return.  Regardless of the incident, the spicy salmon, counter to another reviewer, I found kind of gross- they grind up the salmon and mix spicy flavoring. The beef sticks, chicken sticks and beef/mushroom rolls were flavorless- I can't even conceive how that was possible.  The rest of the sushi was standard issue.  The service, aside from the manager, was fantastic- too bad they didn't have better food to serve."}
{"text":"In general, good quality of sashimi, they are fresh and not stinking (unlike some other AYCE sushi restaurants). Recommend the white tuna, very filling! Though the ratio between fish and rice of the sushi is too large. Dessert are not that great, but I don't come here for the dessert so that's fine."}
{"text":"It can get a bit pricey, but the sushi is definitely worth it. It's always fresh. I feel like their AYCE selection is lacking a little compared to some restaurants, but what they do have they make really well.   The service is good. The staff is very friendly, warm and quick to serve and clean up the table.   Overall, I love coming here. I used to go at least once a week when I worked in the area and I always left satisfied."}
{"text":"Probably the best AYCE In its area. Quality of the food is where this restaurant shines, the actual meat is fresh and cooked very well. The dishes have flavour and isn't just thrown in a wok and fried.   Price is more expensive than others around this area but it is worth the quality.   If you travel out of this area there are better places for better prices but in his area this place takes the cake."}
{"text":"The lady came over and told us to eat more rice. I however did not want to eat the rice and felt duress. The servers were nice though."}
{"text":"Was the worse all you can eat Japanese Restaurant I have been to. I have never ate such sashimi that is so poorly cut and unfresh. When I saw the name of this Japanese restaurant I thought that there must be Hamachi here. I was wrong. There is no Hamachi on the menu. The price is more expensive than most all you can eat Japanese restaurants. It is $23 per person for adults. I can get way better Japanese food for $21."}
{"text":"Visiting many sushi places all over ontario I can say Yellow tail has a variety of different rolls and decent sashimi. But the amount of rice with little fillings on their rolls are high causing consumers to get full quicker   The problem starts with the service the waiters and waitresses are not attentive on customers as I've noticed and they do not complete orders. This maybe due to short staff amounts and high amounts of customers  Price wise the store is quite up there for normal quality AYCE probably due to the local location. Lunch prices will run on par with other sushi restaurants dinners prices.   Not recommended. With plenty of ayce sushi around the area this restaurant does not compare well.   Toronto Food Review"}
{"text":"Its just decent, definitely one of the better ones in the area but still far from amazing. I'd only recommend this place if you're in the area and not trying to go far. Its also a little pricey for the size and amount of sushi pieces per roll. But again its not terrible its just meh."}
{"text":"One of my go-to AYCE choices as it has been consistent over the years. The owner is one of the nicest people ever, and always very accommodating.  They have a pretty good assortment of dishes and foods you can pick here, and it's always good quality for the price you are paying. The staff are always quick and attentive, bringing you dishes and quickly removing any dishes that are finished.  One of the better places in my opinion, with lots of space and comfortable seating. Definitely worth considering if you want some great AYCE sushi at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my family.   It was a Friday and not very busy at all.  There was quite a lot of choices when it came to food.   They have a few of their own style rolls as well as all the classics and favourites.   Salmon sashimi could have been cut a bit bigger which is fine cause you can always order more (just a preference).  Where they really stand out is the staff.   All were very pleasant and attentive.   Our waitress was very good at explaining the items and was very patient.   Our tea was always full and the staff worked very hard.     I would go again, being more empty was definitely a plus as it was easy to hear and food came very quick."}
{"text":"Great sushi for far up north. There are quite a bit of great sushi restaurants north of Highway 7 and this has got to be one of my new favorites. The food was fast and fresh. They took more care and presented the food really well. I had a few sushi rolls, some sashimi and a few deep fried and grilled dishes. The sashimi was great but was brought to us almost frozen, but still edible and the rest of the dishes were about what you would expect for sushi. The atmosphere is bright and a little smaller than I expected and the service was okay, nothing special."}
{"text":"Pretty good AYCE Japanese. The fish is about as fresh as they come for an AYCE restaurant and the rest of their menu is also pretty good, for the most part.  I'm a little disappointed in their udon and ramen though.  It tastes a little bland and watery.  The rest of the menu makes up for this, so it's not too bad.  Funny enough, I love that they offer cookies and cream ice cream (called Oreo cookie on the menu).  It's a pretty random flavor to have but it just seems to be the perfect ending to a really good meal.  The service is always very friendly and I never feel rushed.  They'll also take the time to make sure they get your order correct (which seems to be rare for any AYCE place nowadays).  This is a pretty balanced and fairly good Japanese AYCE restaurant.  Not the best, to be honest, but definitely one of my favourites in the Markham area."}
{"text":"A pretty good AYCE place and a pretty friendly atmosphere. The sushi and sashimi seems always fresh when I'm here and the staff are always quite nice."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive, even for all you can eat. The service was sub par, seemed like we were not welcome. Will not be returning.."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night at around 8 & the place seemed pretty nice and it was empty, which is a bit weird on a Sunday night. But anyways, got seated right away and got asked for what beverage we'd like. Very nice service and all, waiters were good. But in my opinion this place is definitely NOT worth the $26.99, I came with my boyfriend and the total came to about $66.04 I believe including tips (which they add onto the bill already for you).   Not entirely a fan of the soy sauce, it tasted a bit sour to me & the fish wasn't as fresh as I expected it to be seeing as there weren't many people.  The rolls had a lot of rice and not much of the \"stuffing\", the sushi was okay but the sashimi tasted a bit room temperature/warm to me, but their spicy udon was good for me. They did forget some orders and messed up a couple times.   The waiters were nice and checked up on us at a decent amount of times, I'd say maybe once everyone 15-20 mins?   Their dessert menu had little to no options as it was all ice cream. Which were all very sweet btw, too sweet. I ordered their red bean ice cream & my boyfriend got the Oreo cookie and cream one, Both EXTREMELY sweet.    All in all, just not worth the $26.99... we just wanted to try some new place but I think we'll just stick to our typical/go to ayce restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was decent. The servers took our drink orders as soon as we were seated. Atmosphere was alright very dim lighting. Today was 30 degrees outside and there were no air conditioning. Can hardly breath while eating. Sashimi was not fresh at all. We ordered surf clam and salmon sashimi. Sweet potato tempura was not cooked throughly. We also ordered other dishes but was not worth mentioning. First time here and will be the last time."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times but 1st time reviewing. Located near the corner of a plaza at 16th & Woodbine Ave. The asthetics are pleasant, clean & the service is exceptionally prompt & friendly. The menu is Fresh & straight forward with some interesting additions/combinations not usually seen in other Sushi/Ramen places. Prices are on the higher side of avg but it's worth it. I did, however, for my very first time have some Mackerel Row that was extremely \"fishy\" which later gave me slight indigestion All in all, a recommended Sushi place when in the area"}
{"text":"So far very good! Food is fresh, amazing selection. and DRINKS ARE INCLUDED!! how could you go wrong?? close by and is open 7 days a week!!   Definetly worth a try!!"}
{"text":"Yellowtail is located on Woodbine and 16th Ave. They recently had a grand opening around June 2011.   It is AYCE and they also have individual orders and Take-Out. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is amazing and comfortable. Customer Service is SUPERB!! They even change your plates when it gets soysauce/wasabi all over it! They really appreciate their customers and the food is amazing. Never been disappointed with the food or the service.   The price is reasonable and the food is fresh.   My favourite things to order are: Muscle with wasabi sauce, Muscle with sake, Garlic beef cubes, sashimi (tuna - the best tuna ever, salmon, red snapper), mango maki roll, green dragon maki roll, fire dragon maki roll, Eel Pizza (great toppings), all the tempuras are fresh and delicious too!   I definately recommend this restaurant and no other sushi restaurants can compare after you've eatten from here!!   They have a coupon in the mail and they're doing 15% Off dine-in or take-out Valid until Dec 15th.  Amaaazing!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The most recent time was over the weekend for my mother's birthday.  The food: There were a few dishes that I really liked. The salmon sashimi was very fresh. The beef cubes with garlic was super delicious; my sisters and I couldn't get enough. We ordered one dish the first time around, then two the second time around and continued ordering it until we were full. The salmon with avocado roll was a pleasant surprise for the taste buds. When you first put it in your mouth, it doesn't taste like anything special, but once the flavours mix, it's like, wow, I made a good choice! The soft shell crab roll was also a good choice. A plus is that their drinks are also all you can drink. The fried bananas were so good as was the green tea ice cream. We ordered both and ate them together. Heaven! I suppose that at an all you can eat place, not all the dishes are a score, but if you know which ones are good and you stick to those, then you won't be disappointed.  The place: It was clean and well laid out. The decor is modern. Pleasant on the eyes. We came here once for a family reunion with 20+ people and although they don't have a separate space for bigger parties, it worked out well enough with their regular layout; we could still get around and interact with each other.  The service: I would have to give them an A+ in service. All the waiters were really friendly and patient. At an all you can eat place, you kind of want to order everything on the menu so we usually list everything we want starting from the first page to the last. The waitress didn't show a hint of annoyance when we changed our minds a few times. They helped us take pictures and when we asked them to take out our mother's birthday cake, they surprised us by blaring the Happy Birthday song on their speakers and singing along as well. A very nice touch."}
{"text":"'Warm sushi rice' should be enough information for a review. Yuck. The actual fish was decent quality but the warm rice destroys it. Lunch AYCE menu is extremely limited in terms of sushi, almost half the menu was dinner only, e.g. zero sashimi at lunch. 10% service charge added to bill with 1 person, I was not informed of this beforehand which is extremely dishonest--I usually give a higher tip than that but adding it without saying so upfront is outright fraud. Very overpriced for the overall quality."}
{"text":"I came here about 5-6 months ago, so this review is slightly overdue.  We came here for a very late lunch (4:30), so our obvious choice was to do the AYCE dinner.  I thought the sashimi was very well executed, however I found that the maki rolls (while not too much rice) weren't that tasty and somewhat bland.  Tempura was very good though.  It's located in the same plaza as T&T, so if you want sushi and in the plaza/immediate area, worth a try, but there are many other sushi options if you are willing to drive an extra 5-10 minutes."}
{"text":"Forget about this place and go to Gal's 5 minutes away.   My partner and I came for late lunch on Sunday with no other customers around. We ordered the 36 piece sushi and sashimi combo.   Food came promptly and service was chipper, but sadly that can't make up for mediocre food.   Almost all of the sushi rice was dry/hard and too lightly vinegared, sushi pieces were thin and small, the salmon was really fishy, and the maki was bland as hell (we had 12 pieces of maki which basically featured cucumber...).   Nope, definitely not coming back. Life's too short to eat bad sushi."}
{"text":"This rainy Wednesday night was quiet.  Sashimi was good for an AYCE.  The rolls (tried the mango, green dragon, and Hawaiian) were decent as well.  There was quite a bit of rice on the Hawaiian, but the other 2 were perfect.   The grilled items were also good for an AYCE.  Desert consists of only ice cream.  Servers were friendly and made suggestions on what to eat.  They also switched clean plates halfway which was a nice touch.  At the end,  she asked if there's anything we needed before she closed the kitchen (we were there for a while and the last table).  A+ on service!"}
{"text":"Came here on a regular weekday night. When we walked in, we were greeted right away, the environment was quite spacious and the booths we sat in gave us a bit of privacy that not all restaurants are able to give. We were asked if we wanted to eat AYCE or the a la carte menu. At first, we were considering AYCE, but after realizing that the evening AYCE price was some ridiculous $36 as quoted from one of the servers, we decided we weren't going for it.   We decided to order a sashimi and maki combo and a bento box coming to a total of roughly $50 including tips and tax. The sushi quality was mediocre, the rice was a little loose in my opinion, but I really liked how they served the sashimi and maki separately. The bento box was a little more unique serving fried wonton as a part of the side dishes, which is rather creative compared to other places who gives just a salad, japchae noodles, etc."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Spicy salmon was a little spicy for my liking but the salmon and avocado was pleasantly tasty. Their sliced beef with enoki mushrooms would have to be my hands down favourite. Will return and recommend."}
{"text":"My opinion hasn't changed since this place first opened when I first graduated high school. It's pretty good! Prices are average for the AYCE sushi industry.  Not sure why it's always lacking in people - the food is good and the service is good as well. Staff are super attentive, always making sure we were cared for. Annie, the owner is always sweet af.  Lots of stuff to choose from on the menu - I like that you can get mango salad hand rolls, or avocado salad hand rolls so it eliminates the rice. Don't get me wrong, I'm a motherfucking carb queen but when I'm doing the occasional once or twice a year AYCE sushi meal, I need to reserve my stomach space.  (ps. I don't eat fish.. or anything that moves really.. and still found enough options to eat, so that's definitely a thumbs up for this place!)  Also - bottomless soda drinks. I'd really like this place more if they offered more than ice cream and deep fried banana for dessert. Like those mango yogurt or coconut milk desserts. Then this place would be perf.  I would definitely recommend this sushi spot if you're looking for a place to go in markham."}
{"text":"I can't remember if I wrote a review for this place yet but I am going to write one again as I just had lunch here today.  The service is always excellent here, they are always around when you need them.  They are also very patient, when you take a while selecting the food items you want For your all you can eat they never seem to sound annoyed.  Last time I was here I was here for a dinner and the server was very friendly helpful and funny.  The last time I was here I had dinner and surprisingly it was very good but now that I am here for lunch the lunch menu doesn't offer the same food selections as dinner so it felt a bit lacking but that is to be expected.  The spicy salmon roll is always the best here along with shrimp tempura but today was my first time I tried ordering the ramen and it was a bit bland.  This place is clean and friendly and always has tables without having to wait, I will come here again."}
{"text":"Low-key sushi place in Markham - this place has AYCE and a la carte menu options. My boyfriend and I have been coming to this place since we started to date (~1 year ago), and it is consistent across visits. We usually order some teriyaki grill, sushi, sashimi, tempura and noodles as part of our dinner. The service is always top notch - the staff is truly amazing in terms of customer service."}
{"text":"Could be a good place with a bit of work.  I had stopped for Chatime and realized it was noon, and I was hungry.  They have lunch specials and AYCE.  The AYCE was priced at a stunning $19 or $27 depending if you want the dinner selections or not.  Not wanting to load up on the first visit, I started with a Sushi Sashimi Combo for $13.  It included a slightly weak Miso soup and an unremarkable salad.  The staff confirmed there was the nasty \"white tuna\", and happily subbed it out for Pickled Herring.  Overall, there were 6 pieces of sashimi, 6 pieces of sushi made of 2 Salmon, 2 Herring, and 2 shrimp.  Also included was 2 tiny spring rolls and 2 mystery gyoza.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, but it seems they automatically tack on a 10% tip to the bill.  Not cool.  I normally tip at least 15%, so this didn't work out in their favor.  Fish quality was OK, but it was an undersized meal.  I left still hungry."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi that costs $27 per person. Their sushi is terrible, and having 8 piece per order makes it even worse, since you will have to finish more of the awful sushi. The non-sushi items are o.k, e.g. the salmon belt, short ribs and skewers etc."}
{"text":"Weekend lunch buffet was around 15$, a lot of items on the menu were excluded.  Service was friendly.  miso and the udon were both good.  sushi was nice. maki some were good some were just okay. (no sashimi for lunch).  All of the deep fried options were pretty horrid though... DF squid = flavourless, DF scallops = McD's fillet-o-fish without the bun, the DF banana = no good.  Angus beef was salty.  I won't be back, mainly because I would rather pay a bit more for better quality and selection."}
{"text":"Short ribs and meat are tender. Salmon Sashimi cut paper thin! Sushi rolls were small, not very nice. Service was decent though.  EDIT: tip is still included and the bottomless drinks are part of the AYCE.   Overall 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"Yellowtail? More like YellowFAIL.  The service here is the worst. The only thing saving this place (and the reason I gave it the second star) is the fact that the food is decent.  Okay, I have to admit. I did like this place, once upon a time ago. When it first opened, prices were cheaper, food quality was better, and service was great. But over time, all aspects of this place started going downhill. The only reason I still come back is because for some reason, my parents are blind to the decline and love it here. So we came here last night, since it was what my parents wanted.  Let me start with the food. It's just like your typical AYCE sushi. There's a good variety of things to choose from. They've got your sashimi, soups, rolls, makis, grilled and tempura stuff.  They do seperate their menu between lunch & dinner, as well as weeknights and weekends. You have to pay a premium to get all the good stuff. Yes, sesame ice cream included. Might I add, when ice cream is the ONLY dessert you offer, you shouldn't charge extra for sesame ice cream. Go to Ten Ichi. They have a huge variety of desserts (mango dessert!!) at no extra cost. Ice cream is a given. What a disappointment.   Let's get on with service. Multiple times, I've experienced rudeness, all from the owner. She is the chinese lady wearing glasses, usually dressed in black.  The last time we were here, my sister left half a ball of rice on her plate from nigiri sushi, and when she came by to pick up the plate, she scolded my sister for not eating that tiny piece of rice. \"You can't do that, we charge extra for uneaten food..\" she said. Are you serious? There goes your tip lady.  Last night we went as a table of 8. Natually we were seated 4 on each side. When she came to take our order, we tried to order together and she told me she will take the other side of the tables order after she took that sides order first because it was too hard for her to remember. Okay? But you're writing it on a piece of paper.. so she made us feel like we weren't one party ordering together. Then as the food came out, it was all mixed up anyway. What difference did it make having to order seperately?   I can understand experiencing rudeness from servers sometimes, but a rude owner? She doesn't value her customers. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Why does a restaurant named Yellowtail not serve Yellowtail (Hamachi)?  We just found it ironic.  We've been there twice now, both times it was pretty busy, but the service was good. The AYCE option at lunch is pretty good, not the cheapest around for lunch, but about $1 more than other Richmond Hill/Markham ones at $13.99.  The food is good and fresh.  The rolls are good, not too much rice, and enough fish, etc.  Their menu variety was OK, but who really needs 100+ items anyways since most people end up eating the same 15-20 things.  The only thing I wasn't thrilled about is that Kids are still charged quite a bit.  I can't remember the exact amounts, but I recall walking in with my 3 kids and realized I'd be paying an arm and a leg for lunch because each of them (all under 10) would be charged more than what they could possibly eat.  So as a family restaurant, this would be an expensive outing.  If you're just a couple, then this really doesn't matter.  So all in all, I'll go at lunch with my work buddies, but I wouldn't come here if I have to bring my kids.  It's just too expensive to bring kids."}
{"text":"We come here because it's close by, and the food comes fast for an AYCE.  There's not as much selection as other AYCE places around, and because of this, you can notice a significant difference between the clientele here vs. other AYCE Japanese restaurants.  The sashimi and sushi are pretty good, but then these are usually ordered the most at AYCE so it's hard to go wrong.  I agree with Derek L that there was a lot of rice under the fish but I didn't get any complaints when I took out some of the rice.  Surprisingly, their mussels with wasabi are really good.  A must try!  Get this instead of the mussels with sake which were flavourless.  Tempura was good but the rest of the cooked meats (teppanyaki and other grilled / skewered meats) were overcooked.  Skip the ramen and udon, these were bad Chinese imitations of the real thing.  So, if you're looking for an AYCE can has quality sushi and sashimi with limited selection, give this a try. If you're looking for a place that has good cooked Japanese food as well, this might not be the best place to go."}
{"text":"I have been here about a dozen times for lunches.  The food is okay.  The best is maki rolls as they are well rolled and there is limited rice.  The fish on the sushi is fresh and delicious, but there is too much rice on the sushi.  The cooked and grilled items are quite delicious.  My favorite item is eggplant tempura.  The ice creme is heavenly.  The service has always been attentive and quick during lunch time on weekdays."}
{"text":"Bland, expensive and crappy selection, do not come here for lunch!!! The selection for lunch is terrible and their food barely has any flavor, I had $20 for crappy disgusting sushi, btw we ate here on family day"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!! And great service. Their shrimp tempura and spicy salmon sushi pizza are bomb!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night and this place only had a few customers. I was nervous at first due to the lack of people but most AYCE sushi restaurants are dead on the weekday.  I thought that overall, the food was good. My only complaint was that the sushi had too much rice on it and I couldn't really taste the fillings. What I do like about this restaurant is that they didn't miss any of our order. If they did miss any of our order, I would be a little bit concern because there wasn't many people there.  The service here was excellent. It was a bit odd how the staff rearranged our table so frequently though..."}
{"text":"I fuckin love this resto , finally an AYCE sushi place that offers quality service !   I love the premium high quality cuts of meat ... steak with garlic .. & the favourite .. Angus beef ribs :) don't miss out ... Order 10 pieces :)   But I come here for the sashimi ..   I order 50 pieces of salmon sashimi ..   I love this place ..   I ordered 50 .. I got 50 :)   Not 10 LOL ( you'll understand if you are a hardcore sashimi eater : when other restaurants take your order and give you way less because they are \"busy\" .. it's annoying .. because you would have to wait and re order .. Time wasted .. )   I order 50 .. I get 50 .. And so will you :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely in my top 5 favorite sushi restaurant for how fresh the food is and how fantastic the staff is."}
{"text":"You know how some restaurants advertise a certain time and close early? That's this place. Came here at 9pm to eat a quick ayce. Upon entry a little boy at a booth said to us 'they're closing in 5 mins', while a lady asked us how many and told us to have a seat at a nearby booth. I asked her hesitantly.. 'are you closing..?', to which she responded: 'yes, in 5 mins... are you ordering a la carte?' LADY, how am i gonna eat within 5 mins regardless if it's a la carte or not?!?? Aiyah!! So I answered no I want ayce, thanks bye. I double checked the closing hours on their website in case the yelp ones were wrong before posting this. Never got to try their food. I generally don't get as agitated if this occured downtown because of options available but I had to drive here and ughhhhhh!!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were always curious about this place so we tried it for dinner one time. We would've given it a 2.5 stars but that wasn't an option. Service and quality of fish was average. We appreciated the honesty of advertising escolar as escolar (a lot of places advertise escolar as tuna when it actually isn't). There generally wasn't lot of variety. For the price we pay, we felt that it wasn't that worth it. Disappointing since it's so conveniently close by to where I live."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Part of 3, we chose A la carte over AYCE. Chicken udon was good in large portion, sashimi bento box including miso soup & salad was fresh and worth $$. Service 5/5. Eventho it's around 12noon but not as busy."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm too picky, but the food here doesn't worth 25$, especially when other ayce sushi places have the same price and way better food  I checked the reviews on Yelp(3.5stars) before I came here, and both my friends and I were shocked about the quality of the food- the salmon sashimi was not fresh, the roll was full of rice, the beef skewer was over cooked...... I really don't understand why some reviewers said this place is the best ayce in Markham   Most of the rolls were 8 pcs per order and we didn't get the chance to try different rolls  If you just want to grab something to eat, go All Stars Wings next door; if u want to spend 25$ for sushi, go other places"}
{"text":"I've always lived so close to this restaurant but never tried it for years ... until now. We came on a weekday night and it was pretty dead, which was a pleasant surprise because it mean the food came out pretty fast. It was an average experience, pretty much what I expected because I heard this place was okay.  We got the sashimi and maki roll platters with a tempura bento box, they were pretty decent nothing super special but it wasn't terrible. We went to eat and left, it was a pretty average experience."}
{"text":"Been going here for a while and have always received excellent service and food. One of my favourite AYCE sushi restaurants! I drive up from Scarborough just to go here."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars.   I visited this strip mall to get a gel manicure. After my manicure was over, I was hungry. It was pouring rain. I walked around the perimeter, where I could stay dry while figuring out where to go for lunch.   I stood outside Yellowfin's window and went through the menu. Ramen! I was sold.   I walked in and was promoted greeted by the server. I sat down on a comfortable padded bench and read the menu. There were plenty of lunch specials.   For lunch, I settled for a Diet Coke, fried gyoza, and chicken ramen. The chicken ramen was part of the lunch special. I have a weakness for gyoza and I needed the Diet Coke to wash everything down.  The lunch special was decent. I got miso soup and salad as starters. The miso soup was nice. It wasn't overly salty. It was perfect. It had some seaweed, and carrot and tofu cubes in it. The salad was fine. Nothing to write home about. It was good.  My gyoza came to me. I typically like pan-fried gyoza more. These fried ones weren't burnt to a crisp that they'd break a tooth. They were moist on the inside, flavourful, and perfectly done. No complaints here.  My chicken ramen was ready. The temperature was perfect. The chicken had a light batter, which I appreciated. The chicken had skin on it. The crispy skin parts were tasty. When the skin wasn't crispy, I didn't like it as much and actually tossed it off to the side.  As much as I like seaweed, there was far too much of it in the ramen. I ended up fishing the seaweed out and placing the fragments on the now empty gyoza platter. If the seaweed were toasted or were dry to begin, I would have enjoyed them more. The seaweed was a dark green colour with little flavour.  The ramen noodles were perfectly done. I may have to go back and try the other varieties.  My server was friendly and responsive. It was a good time to go in, as it wasn't crowded.   It's a decent place. I am glad that I found it. I will be back to try out the sushi and edamame.  (17)"}
{"text":"Salmon sashimi is very thin and not fresh at all.  Rolls are pretty bad.  Stuffed with rice and the size is huge.  Service is good to begin with until she asked us to finish the food on the table while we're still eating."}
{"text":"it was about $30 something per person on a thursday night.  we were pretty much the only people in the entire restaurant until about 3/4 through our meal another small table came in. so it wasn't very busy at all.  my sister had an issue with the service. said that the server talked was talking to her as if she's never been to an ayce sushi place before and that we should make multiple rounds of orders so that we don't over order. server was kinda right and it's not like they were busy so the food wasn't going to take forever to come out.  my mom had an issue with the maki rolls coming out before the sashimi, saying they wanted to fill us up on rice before serving sashimi. i can see her point.  i'm not too picky with these things though, it didn't really strike a nerve for me. the food was overall decent. nothing i can recall that really stood out to me as wow, this is different. i do like their ice cream options though. cappucino and oreo (which i think is cookies and cream). it's hard to get my to stray from my mango ice cream, but these two would do the job."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend, at first glance it's pretty quiet and not that much people here.  There's only one sushi chef , so that's probably why it took a while for the orders to come. The staff here are nice and attentive , however some of the orders that we place did not come.  We ordered something as simple as the seaweed salad and it did not come , it doesn't take that long to prepare.  The sushi was soso, be noticed most of the ones we got were overstuffed with rice !  After eating, we didn't feel so good.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushi restaurant. The chefs take the time to decorate the plate, the food quality is very consistent, and the staff is very welcoming. I've eaten here many times and it is worth what you pay, better than other all you can eat sushi restaurants when considering the flavour and quality of sushi, some people may argue that the variety of sushi from the menu is limited and I can see what they are saying however I feel that Yellowtail offers a good variety and most importantly great quality. I highly recommend Yellowtail. Thanks for taking the time to read my review."}
{"text":"I had a surprisingly good all-you-can-eat dinner experience here.  I don't usually compliment the service of Asian businesses, in particular Chinese-owned restaurants, but Yellowtail definitely impressed me with their fantastic level of service.  I did not expect the quality of food to be so good. The raw fish was refreshing, the sirloin steak (in cubes) with garlic was succulent and the tempura was crispy and not watery. The hot food was actually hot in temperature like it was just prepared.   If you want more expensive fish, you will have to pay extra for it. This is a common business strategy but the only type of fish they offered me was hamachi (yellow tail).  The variety on the menu is lacking. For example they do not serve any soba (buckwheat noodles). There are only 6 kinds of sashimi to choose from (tamago (egg) doesn't count!). Their desserts only consist of ice cream with many flavours such as green tea, red bean, vanilla, mango, cappuccino, Oreo cookie and sesame (only on weekends). I do not think a reasonable person will have too many complaints about the menu though. With the small number of items they do serve, they make them very well. The quality makes up for the quantity in my opinion.  The prices are clearly presented on the homepage of their website. The entire menu is there too so there should be no surprises when you visit.  They currently have a coupon on their takeout menu/flyer for free California rolls when you stop by. I'll be sure to give them a visit in the near future. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"after so many years I cannot believe this place is still open; it was mediocre then and is mediocre now. Literally a dime a dozen.. but Ill give it an extra star just for hanging around for so long."}
