{"text":"Where have you been all my life??!!!   We wondered up on this gem of a restaurant!!  We had the fried pork chops, collards, macaroni & cheese and added a side of fried okra!  The food was flavorful and fresh!!!  The banana pudding was to die for!!!  Don't be put out by the exterior because the food is delicious!!!  The staff was very friendly and inviting!!  We will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good! My sister and daughter had the chicken and waffles and they both said it was very good!"}
{"text":"Hard to find and meat and three option these days with the influx of chains around.  Glad we stopped by Vell's for lunch for chicken and some veggies.  The restaurant is clean and well organized, place your order at the counter, typically a meat with 2 sides and bread (meat and three), then grab you table and drink. No soda fountain here, sodas are bottled and tea (only sweet) is available next to the ice machine alongside Koolaid and lemonade.  The tea was a bit suspect today maybe a bit old for sweet tea so I opted for the lemonade.  Chicken was well seasoned and super moist, add your hot sauce at the table and dig in. Occasionally they offer a dipped style chicken which is fried and dipped in a sweet & spicy mix.  Look for the specials next to the register, on Thursday and Friday they offer \"Oops Wings\" these are mis-cut wings they sell at a bargain.

{"text":"I went in around 2pm on a Tuesday for lunch. For about 20 minutes I was the only customer there. Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by the cook and the lady at the counter. The place was very clean and I noted the 96 inspection rating and was pleased. I ordered the fried pork chop entree that came with two sides and a dinner roll. I chose mac and cheese and potato salad as they are two things that say a lot when it comes to soul food. I also ordered lemonade to go with my meal. Lemonade, tea and kool-aid were in the dining area available for free refills. My total cost minus tip was $12.29. My pork chop was seasoned and fried well. The mustard based potato salad was also good. My dinner roll was a bit of a cold temperature which I was not expecting. Mac and cheese wasn't bad but for me it wasn't great. It reminded me more of a kraft type mac and cheese that was prepared and then baked a tad bit. Nothing close to the oven baked mac and cheese with the slightly crisp top layer your mom and grandma would make. Overall, it was a good experience as food was good, place was clean, reasonably priced and the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"Has to wait a bit, but food was very fresh tasting. The Soul Roll is delicious, will definitely have that again - mac'n'cheese and beans inside an egg roll shell.   Also had the fried ribs - very nice, not overly breaded. Collards were on point, though I would have liked more bacon/ham flavor   The Oops wings were great, too.  Will definitely be back often, as it's one of the closest restaurants too our house."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow!! My fiancé and I love soul food and had no idea this gem was right under our noses! First impressions of the place were that it was very clean and felt like you were in someone's home. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. Ok, so let me get to the food...IT WAS AMAZING!!! I ordered the two piece fried chicken with Mac and cheese and greens. The roll was hot and soft. The sweet tea was so good. I would give this place 10 stars if I could!! Will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"This little spot was a delight.  My fiancé and I stopped in on a whim after unknowingly passing it every day for months.  We tend to not poke our heads into spots without a yelp page, but I'm glad we did in this case!  My fiancé had the soul roll combo with two sides - (soul roll being collared greens, BBQ beans, and mac and cheese wrapped into an egg roll with special sauce) and we both loved it.  I stole many bites!  I tried the Vell's burger - two patties on a hoagie with salami, pepperoni and cheese AND FRIES.  The portions were HUGE, especially for the price!  We remarked to one another that we hoped they would raise the prices so they would stay in business cus we had no idea how they could do it otherwise.  It did take some time to make the food, but I attributed that to it being made fresh to order.  Many others were waiting for to go orders, a good sign - we thought as we waited. We also snagged a dessert.  I usually turn my nose up to super sweet cakes but my fiancé was craving a slice.  I had every intention of just letting him enjoy but he assured me it wasn't \"too sweet\" and he was right.  A perfect balance.  The location might seem a little strange but the inside was clean, friendly and obviously the food was awesome!  We can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"We were in town for my daughters dance competition and needed to eat out but were tired of fast food. As usual, YELP delivered! I found Vell's and decided to try it out. We got 4 meals 2 kids and 2 adults. The fried boneless chicken and the fried bone in chicken were both delicious. It was like going to my grandmas after church on Sunday. We got takeout and we should have gotten takeout menus because I can't tell you how many times we were asked where we got our dinner. I finally started showing people the yelp page and I hope others did venture there even though the weather was terrible. They have something called a soul roll that was like an egg roll with baked beans, mac-n-cheese, and collard greens that was quite interesting and yummy."}
{"text":"I think the little woman saw this place on FB it's quaint kinda home like the waitress  was very nice cute young lady the cooking staff also seemed nice .

{"text":"I LOVE IT HERE! THE FOOD IS AWESOME!!! You can't leave here without trying the soul roll, greens, dipped chicken when on special, or banana pudding!"}
