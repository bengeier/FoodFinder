{"text":"Very friendly owners/servers and decent food.  A mostly Korean menu with some Hawaiian BBQ, burgers, etc. added on.  The food is fresh and hot but not the best in terms of flavor (maybe not enough seasonings?).  (Pass on the fries.  Bibimbap and volcano pork are quite good.)  But as service counts for a lot in this girl's book, I'll stick to my 4 stars."}
{"text":"Nice and fresh. Some pieces could use more chicken than batter. Chicken has the same consistent taste which is always welcomed. Especially when you have a craving for chicken. 

It's still one of my go to places when it comes to chicken."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place, it's alright but def. doesn't compare to L&L even though they are pretty much copying everything. The macaroni salad tastes terrible! Meat is really overcooked and doesn't have good flavor. Would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came in expecting something different, but came out thoroughly excited to come back for more!

We had the Beef Combo and the Yum Yum Fried Chicken. Oh my goodness, hands down the best fried chicken we ever had! It had the most outstanding crunch, but the inside was still juicy and tender!! Seriously, mouth-watering good! The sauce was sweet, but had a very mild spice. Amazing! 

Can't wait to go back and try the other fried chicken flavours! 

Owner was super personable and happy that it made our experience even better!"}
{"text":"Great place to get my Korean food fix!

The staff are very very nice! 

Their soondubujigae (tofu soup) is awesome! I asked if it was spicy since it did not have a chili pepper sign next to it and they said they could make it spicy for me. I also really love their kimchee fried rice! Huge portions!

Their AYCE is very delicious! I like that they have a mix of korean and even hawaiian style things. Their garlic shrimp is very tasty and addicting! The price is very affordable at $13.99. 

AYCE is kind of hard when its busy just because it starts to get slow with the food coming out. One time it was busy and the guy just told us we can just order what we wanted (usually a 2 plate max at a time). Thus, we didn't have to wait everytime we were done to order and get our food.

They also have shave ice! You can add condensed milk or ice cream to your shave ice! mmm!!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken I can wait to try all of the different meals! Very moist crunchy and the best tasting chicken ever."}
{"text":"Nice Korean guy from Lahaina runs this place. All you folks from Maui will love this place cause he's got the kalbi marinade down (almost as good as Azeka's ribs if you know what I mean!)

I will be eating here regularly for the kalbi short ribs :)"}
{"text":"Great service; good food. Take extra time to drive here if you are on your way to SURA BBQ. This is a family business so they care how what the customers think of their service and food. Get the kalbi and the rolls."}
{"text":"You can enjoy best of both worlds and mix your chicken meal with both Yum Yum AND Shallot Chicken!"}
{"text":"It's worth the drive to Airdrie for their fried chicken. Crispy, juicy, made-to-order, and nowhere as greasy as everyone else's fried chicken (talking to you Chicken on the Way)."}
{"text":"While the sushi is not spectacular, it is still pretty darn good for the price. The kalbi, however, makes this place a steal at $14 for the ayce option. My favorite thing about this place has to be the threatening remarks on the menu that state that Yum Yum will charge you for unfinished food. Apparently Yum Yum doesn't want you to waste food, or they want to pretend to be your mom and tell you to clear your plate. Either way, this shouldn't be a problem if you choose the right items (kalbi, meat jun, tempura). Pick wisely and you will crave Yum Yum all the time. One final note would be to stay away from the eel because it's a little funky here (other funky items include chap chae and masubis)."}
{"text":"Something you should know before going; weekdays before 3pm is bbq only and sushi is served all day on weekends only. The bbq is good and the sushi is okay. Weekdays before 3pm is good for korean bbq lunch with banchan. An order of chap chae goes well with the bbq. The kalbi (galbi) is quite tasty. The desert mochi is served whole unless you request that it be cut when ordering. If you find any difficulty in chewing the tuna slices make sure you let the server know so they can get a better supplier. Overall good people and good food. They just need to step it up on fresh tuna quality and make salmon skin rolls a menu item. Their kalbi is a surprisingly formidable rival to the other bbq/sushi restaurants in the southwest."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some quick sushi & hawaiian short ribs before leaving town to go back home.  The food was tasty, and the portions were generous. It was a good value.

My only complaint is that only some of the rolls featured whole pieces of tuna.  I ordered two rolls where the spicy tuna was ground up. A lot of sushi places do this now, and I don't really understand it.

Otherwise, service was friendly & quick, and we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"I just got back from a 6 month stay over in Chicago.  While I was there, I had a really hard time finding good Asian restaurants.  There were a few good ones, but Vegas wins hands down in my opinion.  The first thing I did when returning was to head to my favorite Japanese restaurant.  On my way home from that I noticed quite a few little restaurants had popped up by my house.

I stopped in at Yum Yum and was initially drawn to the overly cute branding.  Apparently one of the brothers in the family that owns this place did all the branding. Now this was one of the major faults of Asian restaurants in Chicago.  Awesome branding, sub par food.  Not the case with Yum Yum. Its a Hawaiian Mom n Pop place and they cook it like they would for their two sons manning the front counter.

Get in there and give it a shot."}
{"text":"Not just Korean fare. If you enjoy any Asian-style BBQ, you'll love this place.  The atmosphere was quiet and casual, but quirky, as the dining area is accented with monkeys and other cute cartoon characters. 
All of the food I tried from the \"all you can eat\" menu (a bargain at $13.99) was delicious and fresh.  Considering everything was made to order, and that there was only only server, the food came out in an acceptable amount of time and was absolutely worth the wait.  

Don't just take my word for it, read the other reviews. You know you've found a great place when people regularly liken it to their mother's cooking."}
{"text":"I love this place! Staff are really friendly! It take 10 to 15mins to make your food but it's worth it because the food are really fresh!"}
{"text":"Although my parents have spent over a decade living in Airdrie, we rarely ever dine in Airdrie. We've heard great things about Yum Yum, so when my parents wanted to go for a quick lunch we thought we'd give this place a try.

We ordered crinkle fries, a  1/2 order of spicy fried chicken and  1/2 order of yum yum sauce chicken. The chicken was so good - there was a perfect balance of crispiness and juiciness! Honestly, we could have just gone with one  1/2 order, but it worked out since leftovers meant I got to enjoy it again later!

Seriously Airdrie's not that far outside the city, so make the trip out and go to Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Good food, huge portions good price. Minus 1 star cause they close so early. Only open until 9pm."}
{"text":"I decided to come here after reading all the Yelp reviews, but I was somewhat disappointed.

Volcano Pork - good spice, good flavor, but VERY greasy
BBQ Beef - VERY dry
Meat Jun - This was very delicious, but it did get a little greasy after a while. It's a thin slice of beef that's dipped in egg and fried.
Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp - Great flavor! This was my favorite dish.
Vegetable Egg Roll - basic, nothing special.

The sushi wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst I've ever had. The plus side is the rolls are huge, but it also keeps you from trying more rolls because you get so full. 

Spicy Tuna Roll - OK
Dragon Roll - Good.
Sexy Girl Roll - Good.

I'll probably give it another chance at some point, but I don't think I\"ll ever come back for the AYCE. The grease just consumed me."}
{"text":"Love the chicken burger. I went there many times. There's a reason why I stopped going to kfc in airdrie. Yum yum bbq had its food always nice and hot and does not feel greasy. Owner is very nice and the rest of the staff. Give it a big thumbs up. I got one request please change the channel on that tv"}
{"text":"On way home from holiday in cherry season in BC. 

10 pm at night nothing open and found this place.

Basically a Korean KFC with several chicken options which taste great."}
{"text":"This is one of the spots I visit for that delicious, tasty, and juicy chicken crave. The seats here are pretty comfy, but can feel cramped due its size, and it can get very busy, but when it's busy expect the service to be a little slow.

I always order their yum yum chicken in special sauce, and a pork bulgogi poutine with a side of rice bowl while watching korean and american music videos. Get those hands dirty on those chicken because it's worth it.

The chicken was moist, yummy batter soaked in yum yum special sauce providing a balance of sweet, spicy, and a hint of tang. The poutine was also amazing and you may request to make it extra spicy. A great infusion of canadian/korean dish.

I highly recommend this place~!"}
{"text":"Do you like Korean-style fried chicken?  Are you near Pacific Place?  Do you like a endless stream of K-Pop music videos?  If you do, then you've come to the right place.  You can't get it this restaurant front within the Pacific Place - you have to enter from the outside.  Once you are inside, there is the unmistakeable strains of K-Pop blaring from the TV combined with friendly and helpful servers wearing what looks to be a pseudo military uniform complete with a badge of the South Korean flag.  Ordering is fast but the cooking is not, it took quite some time for the chicken to arrive every time I was there, but it was worth the wait!  Served hot out of the deep fryer with all the Korean Fried Chicken goodness I know and love.  It is a convenient choice when you are in the area and don't want the typical food court experience that you get inside Pacific Place."}
{"text":"I drove all the way to find this hole in the wall place, and I left disappointed. 
It's a cozy place fit for parents with small children. 
They have Korean-Hawaiian-Japanese dishes, 
The food is mediocre at best. 
We ordered grilled chicken, fried rice and chap chae (clear noodles),and all I can say is it reminded me of cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Out of all the Yum Yum\"s in Calgary, this one has the nicest interior.
Unlike the other two, they have someone who takes your order.
I like the food here, it always comes out hot and tasty. 
The one downside to eating here, is it takes a long time to get your food.
If you're in a hurry, then I would suggest eating elsewhere.
If you wany some tasty deep fried chicken with a mixture of some Korean food then you might want to check this place out."}
{"text":"One really close and easy place to get to whenever I'm hungry and in the mood for fried chicken haha, nice modern looking place with a laid back sense. Quite small but it's cozy, nice place for a date, not so much for a large group. The service was a bit slow when I ordered the chicken, but the fries and poutine came out quite fast. The chicken I had was yum yum chicken and the shallot chicken. They breaded the chicken quite nicely and the chicken was nice and juicy on the inside, crispy and golden brown on the outside just the way I like it. Comparing this to kfc, I would pick this place over it. Great chicken. Nice filling meal. It's a nice place to introduce your friends who never really stepped out of their own comfort food zone to learn and have something that is within their realm of typical food but a little more exotic you feel? Nice friendly staff, kind and patient, overall a nice place would say I will definitely always will come back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give Yum Yum BBQ a shot after hearing many compliments from colleagues. We ordered a beef poutine and half order of yum yum chicken to share. Chicken skin is well seasoned and very crispy, and coated with what we thought a sweet chilli sauce. All the flavours are on the batter and the sauce. Personal preference is to have the chicken marinated first so both skin and meat are well seasoned. Beef bulgogi is very tasty and it makes an awesome poutine."}
{"text":"It's all in the name: Yum Yum BBQ is correct.  Kal-bi, meat-jun, and sushi.  The service is very friendly and the fish tastes fresh.  All you can eat for 14$."}
{"text":"Tried this place today. Got the bbq pork. It's actually pretty good. Decent price. Chicken was nice and crispy. Will be back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out as we had received a mailer for AYCE dinner for less than $20 a person; however, when we got there, they were having a special of $16.95 a person, so we nixed the coupon.  We did have to give our information to get the special pricing (i.e., name, address, etc.), so of course I gave fake information.  The place was a little weird; the location (next to Sonic) is not ideal and there is a smoke shop inside also.  I have never seen a smoke shop in a sushi restaurant, especially in such a small restaurant.  

The sushi selection was not expansive.  The iced tea tasted horrible.  The rice was a bit hard/overcooked, but overall, the sushi rolls were edible.  The server/owner was nice, but a little too curious to know how we heard of his restaurant and also proceeded to tell us details about how expensive rent at the restaurant's former location was.  It was a little awkward since no one was there, so we felt like our every move/word was being watched/heard.  Dessert selection was also not great.

While it wasn't a \"terrible\" experience, I suppose I would rather pay the extra $10 a person and eat at a better sushi restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"4 girls ordered sweet and chili chicken half. Shallot chicken half. And fried potatoes, abt 40 bucks in total. Fast serving. Always love the chickens with some beer at winter"}
{"text":"I would rather come here 9 times outta 10 and do the AYCE rather then going to a buffet on the strip. The food is excellent, and the service is friendly and prompt. A group of 5 hungry guys went in for lunch, and a group of 5 full and satisfied guys left an hour later. Bulgogi, kabi, chicken katsu, kimchee, mac salad, sushi( which is actually very very good) etc etc. At $12.99 for lunch it is one of the best deals in town."}
{"text":"We were leaving Calgary and stopped by Yum Yum Chicken in Airdrie. We decided on the Yum Yum Chicken and the Shallot Chicken to go. There was no one there and one person ordered take out over the phone, which took about 15 minutes (perfect timing if you're going from CrossIron Mills to Yum Yum). 

The chicken was delicious! The Yum Yum had a thicker sauce that was sweet and spicy, where as the Shallot was more crunchy with shallots. The breading is perfect - not to thin but not thick. Some pieces of chicken were a little to thick in my opinion but you're getting about 8 pieces for $13 and that's a steal. Plus, the orders are either half or whole chicken. The orders came with some green onion on the side. 

It was unfortunate that we were scrambling to leave Calgary and we didn't get an opportunity to enjoy the chicken right then and there. We had a bite in the car, and finished it at home. After a 2.5 hour car ride, the chicken was still warm AND crunchy. Amazing. 

The decor inside was pretty basic, with table and chairs and a big TV but as other reviewers mentioned most people probably do take out here."}
{"text":"mmmm.. good stuff! a mix of korean, japanese, and hawaiian food.  12.99 for all you can eat (specific menu). the menu offers a lot of goods.  bulgogi, chap chae, katsu, short ribs... shrimp tempura roll, dragon roll, garlic shrimp, musubi etc.  everything is good!!!! the owner who seems to be running the show all by himself.. was really friendly and attentive.  it's a cozy place that I definitely appreciate. mmmm.."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken on the planet! The cheese tornado potatoes are great too! A must try."}
{"text":"I like the quality and selection of food. the nice environment.Also for about 5 bucks extra you can make a regular meal into all you can eat. I dislike that there is no difference in prices for lunch and dinner, pretty pricey, kinda slow service during when there was anyone except another customer. I would come back and try the all you can eat but afraid of how slow service would be."}
{"text":"Our family was passing through Vegas and wanted yummy Asian food. Yelped and read many good reviews. We liked this little family owned spot. Though we didn't get to try the bim bam bap the BBQ mix plate was a delicious alternative."}
{"text":"Definitely a local's place.  I had the Gal Bi which was pretty darn good.  Loved the greasiness of it.  Just the right amount of flavorings too.  The service was very fast and efficient.  Great place if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"For a few dollars more I will go to Sushi Mon next time I want AYCE Sushi or any Sushi for that matter.  Sushi Mon is that place I compare all other suhsi places unless I find a better one.  Sushi Mon is just down the street in same neighborhood.  Yum Yum BBQ only offers VERY LARGE sushi rolls.  1/2 orders are not allowed so 2 rolls and couple sides and it's about all the variety 2 people can consume on AYCE menu.  No Nagiri Sushi on menu, small selection of fish.  The place is clean and quiet, not very busy when I was there."}
{"text":"The wow chicken of Airdrie.  So much closer than going to Kensington and tastes just as good!  Love the shallot chicken... Yummy"}
{"text":"Great selection , good food, and really tasty sushi .
the service is excellent .
Good value for such great food .
a good combo of Hawaii and Korea .

They also have an awesome all you can eat deal  .

It's definitely worth a try, you wont be disappointed .."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii, I have a high standard for korean plate lunches.  Normally places on the continental U.S. can't even compare to the local food we have in Hawaii.  It's very weird to have a mix of korean and japanese food in the same restaurant.  No one does that in Hawaii.

With all that being said, I was extremely happy with my meal at Yum Yum BBQ.  I had the 2 combination meal with meat jun and bulgogi.   The bulgogi was OK, but the meat jun was delicious.  The meat jun was on the crispy side and didn't ooze any fat.  Some people tend to like the \"wet\" meat jun style where the meat jun is moist with healthy amounts of oil, fat, and egg, but not me.  Yum Yum's meat jun might be my favorite meat jun, which is a shame because I don't live in Vegas.

I also tried 2 sushi rolls, the Yum Yum roll and the shrimp tempura roll. Again it's very weird to have sushi in a korean restaurant, but the sushi was very tasty.  Normally when I go to the mainland to have sushi, I expect bland fish with grainy texture.  I got none of that here.  Both rolls were worthy of being served in Hawaii.

I also tried the tofu soup, but that was watery and didn't taste all that great.

If I lived in Vegas, I definitely wouldn't complain about the option of eating at Yum Yum BBQ.  They make good food for a good price.  If I'm craving Hawaii local style food I would make my way to Yum Yum BBQ."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim and I'm so glad I did. This place is off the chain (not a dog eating joke). It's about $20/person when you do the \"all you can eat\" option. I have never been to a place that served food in this manner, but wowsers... I like! The waiter comes and you order about 2-3 selections per person, you finish that, the waiter comes back, and you order again. This process is repeated until you are stuffed silly.

Can you imagine ordering all the chicken katsu, spam musubi, and kalbi you want? CAN YOU?! Plus, all the food is made to order (I think), so it's steaming hot when it gets to your table.

I didn't try too many of their sushi options, but the cream cheese roll tasted flavorful and fresh. Unlimited drinks are an additional fee and they have a fridge in the lobby where you can get up & grab as many drinks as you want, changing it up each time you go.

To top it all off, customer service was awesome. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. It was seriously so yum yum!"}
{"text":"Awesome kalbi!!!!! Very tasty and meaty!!!! Sushi is good too!!!! Service is great! AYCE and AYCD soda too!!!!"}
{"text":"may i have your attention please.!  this hawaiian style modern bbq is three thumbs up! 98% satisfied there!  he is very sweet korean guy from hawaii! he will assist you with love and care! 
my recommended food there is BBQ beef short ribs-kalbi bento dinner comes with salad,two tempura shrimp, home made kimuchi with moisty japanese rice! inexpensive! below $5 per person, unagi ball is good!  my favorite is $8 giant Bi Bim Bap bowl!  soup is good,too! huge four kinds of original spam musubi!  korean BBQ style with hawaiian mood makes you drool ...... call (702) 614-2133 they deliver ,too! any met katsu cutlet is yum!    you will regret if you don't go!  next door to that place always have a young rock band performing outside of canvas cafe!   it is right behind bank of america on 430 east. silverado ranch blvd #115,lv,nv.89183  cross street is called Bermuda st. gooooooooooooooo!"}
{"text":"Great food. Asian style with fusion of Korean, Japanese and Hawaiian (spam musubi).  Dinner time was packed but the wait was not long.  Service was good."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place. Would frequent here at least once a month. Recently they changed their Kalbi ribs to only one order per person for the All-you-can-eat, which is what I really enjoyed eating along with the sushi. What's the point of an AYCE if it has such a limitation. Especially only ONE order. Don't think I'll be coming back anymore, since their sushi isn't the best but its not bad either. But, without their Kalbi ribs, I'd rather go to Sushi Island or some other good sushi spot."}
{"text":"I went there with a co-worker for lunch for our first visit at Yum Yum BBQ.  They haven't done much advertising.  The only reason we knew of its existence was from a previous visit to another restaurant at the mall.  I have been craving Korean BBQ chicken and immediately thought of coming to this place.  I ordered a 2-piece Chicken Meal which includes small fries and a can of soft drink. The portion was food and was the perfect size lunch meal for me.  I had the shallot chicken and they were yummy.  Something to be aware of is that there is still mildly spicy taste, which I think is in the batter... so it doesn't really matter which flavour (Yum Yum, Shallot, Spicy, Regular Fried) you order, it will be at least slightly spicy... something to be aware of if you have young kids.  

The service received by the waitress was great.  The interior of restaurant is well thought out and decorated nicely.  I will be back but next time I will order just the fried chicken without the fries so I can eat an extra piece of chicken!"}
{"text":"I want to rate it 3.5

Hmm let's see... The serving is decent. I got the BBQ beef combo. The beef was good, rice was soft, the dumplings were not good it tasted like oil with consistency.

I'm not impressed with the salad that came with it. Any salad that only has iceberg lettuce is a useless salad.

I couldn't taste the chicken because the beef overpowered the taste. But the consistency was nice and it wasn't overcooked. The chicken is awkwardly cut though, there was a piece that I had no clue what part of the chicken it was.

The service is good. The server is nice and sweet, there was a customer who was asking freaky weird questions about the waitress though. I was impressed how nice she was regardless of the creepy factor.

Overall it's a mediocre fast food restaurant. For the 14 bucks I spent I would rather go across the street to insadong and feast in all you can eat buffet for 25 bucks."}
{"text":"the service was great, the deal was good, the food tasted okay but I was sick for two days after eating here. thats about as much as I can handle at the thought of this place"}
{"text":"We thought we'd try some place new so we went there. Huge sign said BBQ - SUSHI then smoke shop underneath. Walked in, it was empty and there was a small section dedicated to cigarette purchasing. Place looked like it was on a budget.. A very low budget. Cheaply decorated. Lots of supplies and stuff that should be in storage was laying around. We got excited because there was a special for $16.99 all you can eat. Menu was small. Nigiri (sushi) was not good. Two pieces were fresh but the others looked like they were sitting around for awhile. Also I'm not a sushi chef, but I'm pretty sure there's difference between sushi rice and steamed rice. Miso soup was probably from a package and shrimp tempura look previously frozen. Green tea was served with a hot water in a styrofoam  cup and a tea packet like you would find in a hotel room. Dessert was only three types of mochi & it was okay. I normally love mochi, but after eating some what of my food, I didn't enjoy it as much. I felt really bad because the person serving us was nice, but I honestly could not take anymore."}
{"text":"The benefits for coming to this place: Cheap prices and the perk of having the same price all you can eat for lunch and dinner! It is fairly cheap as well, definitely a plus! Our server was really nice but he was trying to make us order hot food instead of the expensive sushi stuff. He didn't stop us from ordering it but the way he insinuated it bothered me. Oh well, he was a small part of my meal, i enjoyed the food which was the most important thing. It only takes a few plates of food to eat your money's worth and i may have even made them lose money which means you really did eat a lot! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Las Vegas and still getting used to the wide selection of Hawaiian BBQ joints.  We read good reviews here so we went.  Selection seems pretty standard but I like the variety of a Bento Box so I ordered one with Volcano Chicken.  The chicken was probably the best part of both of our meals.  It was spicy (could have been more so for me :) charred, well seasoned and it was thigh meat so it wasn't dried out.  Everything else in the box was just standard.  

My companion ordered a two meat plate with the Volcano Pork and beef that was breaded with egg batter and fried.  They were both mediocre and the pork was a bit gristly and not as charred as the chicken.  All in all it was ok, if you do go, the Volcano Chicken is probably the best bet."}
{"text":"I'm an AYCE nut, and have tried most buffets, all you can eat joints, and salad bars in town.

What makes Yum Yum special is that each dish is cooked to order. Yes, you can only order 3 at a time. Big deal. Eat here more than once and you'll pick up the rhythm right away. 

Service is excellent, as the restaurant is small and the one fella who handles the front of the restaurant stays on the move while the cooking goes on in the back. 

Sushi is included with AYCE, including my favorite, the Philly Roll. It's not $30 AYCE sushi quality, but it's way way better than buffet level and a great deal at half the price.

A number of other items are available, including Volcano Pork, Teriyaki Chicken, Garlic Shrimp, Spam Musubi, and more, but if you don't order Kalbi, and lots of it, you're missing out. I've eaten Kalbi all over town and NEVER found it this tender, juicy, and delicious!

While you're at it, spring a little extra for the flavored tea. I go with Passion Fruit, but they're all fantastic."}
{"text":"I first heard about Yum Yum BBQ from a friend. She said it was cheap, and good so i thought , what could go wrong there? 

The first time I went there I ordered the crispy tempura roll, and the BBQ chicken plate. These dishes were good and made me want to come back for more. The second time I went to Yum Yum in 2009, I finally noticed that they had an \"all you can eat\" menu. The price for the ability to eat all the sushi rolls, and Hawaiian foods that you wanted was an automatic steal. In 2009 the price for the \"all you can eat\" menu was a dollar or two cheaper, like it really makes a huge difference. Along with the \"all you can eat\" there is the \"all you can drink\" option which allows you to get unlimited sodas or bottled waters from their fridge. One soda or bottle of water usually costs around 1.50-2.00  dollars so you might as well add on the \"all you can drink\" option for another 2-3 dollars extra.

The first time I ordered the \"all you can eat\" I brought along 5 of my friends to try it with me. They were here visiting from San Francisco, and of course just wanted to eat, eat, and eat. I thought it was a good way to take a break from all the ordinary Las Vegas buffets. We were amazed at all the food options listed on the \"all you can eat\" menu. There was Hawaiian food such as, chicken katsu, BBQ chicken, spam masubi, etc. There was Japanese food such as the MANY types of sushi rolls they offer (One of my favorite parts about this menu, since regular sushi rolls in other restaurants sell for 8-12 dollars). And there was also delicious Korean BBQ. I definitely suggest the short ribs (kalbi).

Every year when my friends come to visit me, Yum Yum BBQ is always on the list of places to eat at here in Las Vegas. I'm sure the waiter who is always there knows us by now. He is really nice, and has lots of patience when serving a group of people who are all hungry for their yummy dishes. Oh and I forgot to add that you can only order 2 dishes at a time, but since it is a small, usually non-busy place, you'll be able to get your order pretty fast."}
{"text":"YUK YUK BARF-A-QUE
 
It was dinner time and we had a choice, Yum Yum BBQ or El Polo Loco. Hmmm where should we eat?  I figured Yum Yum would be the best pick of the two because it wasn't fast food. 

Standing at the counter there is no menu above but a picture of large cartoon characters. A small menu was located to the left that is so low that you have to bend over to read it.  So I stood up and ordered. Our food comes out (BBQ mix plate and Chicken Katsu). I should let you know this place is pretty much like a wanna be L&L BBQ. So, I would think that the portions would be close to an L&L mix plate for the same price of $8.99........... Noooooope. I also didn't think I would spend $20 for two plates.

The food was bland, over cooked, took way to long (maybe the reason it was over cooked?) and the portion size was an insult to my hard earned $8.99. I don't want to say all bad stuff....... The older lady was nice.

Ok, so the lesson of the story is that if you want Hawaiian BBQ or someones spin on it you should just stick to the big hitters. I'm not sure how in a city of a million restaurants this place stays in business. 

Never again...."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken in Calgary (or Airdrie!). The batter is so crispy and not greasy at all. The shallot chicken is my favourite. There is a subtle sweetness to it and the green onions complement the chicken so well. Also, try the bulgogi poutine. It is so good, though I wish it came with better fries (they are like crinkle cut fries that remind me of the mccains frozen variety) and I wish it came in a smaller portion as it is huge!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Yum Yum BBQ.  My husband and I are regulars here.  We have tried all the menu items on the AYCE menu, and we are working our way through the regular menu.  Everything is fantastic.  We usually do the AYCE, and even though I was disappointed when they raised the price from $13.99/person to $15.99/person, it's still worth it.  Their sushi rolls are huge and delicious, and the BBQ short ribs are the best we have ever HAD anywhere.

I love this place."}
{"text":"I'm not a raw sushi fan so the love me roll is perfect!! I drive here all the time from across town when I'm craving sushi because so far they have the best rolls I've ever tried! The owner is very nice also"}
{"text":"Cheapest AYCE sushi price 16.99$ for the whole day. The whole menu is include in AYCE. This place is really hidden by Sonic so me and my husband are usually the only ones there. The restaurant itself isnt anything fancy. The owner is really nice and didn't charge for my couple of unbeaten rolls. It's not the best sushi but for the price and the decency of it, I will keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"I happened to be in Airdrie one day this week around lunchtime so decided to stop in and grab some take out. Having read some blog posts about Korean fried chicken I was interested in trying it to compare to my stand by, Chicken On The Way. 

We got 2 shrimp burgers (I had a SUTP coupon for buy one get one free) and a half chicken that was part Yum Yum and part Shallot. The burger was good and I liked the amount of lettuce, onions and tomatoes and was impressed that the shrimp still stood out from the other toppings. Out of the two chicken flavours that we got the Shallot Chicken was the best hands down. It was seasoned well and very crunchy even after the drive to South Calgary. The Yum Yum Chicken was tasty with a nice balance of sweet and spicy. 

I still prefer Chicken On The Way over this but it's a solid fried chicken meal if you live close by. I wouldn't drive that far for this meal but would likely try it again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"It's cheap and you get what you pay for. My iron stomach is a total mess... Never felt this bad after sushi in my life."}
{"text":"My Kal Bi crush.

Heard about this place through Yelp (shocking, eh) and decided to give it a go.  What drew us here was the $14 AYCE.  Seriously, how can you NOT eat $14 worth of Korean food?

We tried a bunch of rolls and most of the meats. The stars of the show were the Kal Bi and \"Volcano\" pork.  I love love love Korean spicy pork and, while this place doesn't have the best, it's pretty darn tasty.  As for the Kal Bi, it was close to being the best I have found in Vegas: tender, savory, slightly charred and still pink in the middle.  My son tore it up.  Between three adults and a one year old, we must have demolished about 6 orders.

As good as the Kal Bi was, I have to say that the sushi rolls just weren't very tasty.  I can't even remember which ones we ordered (we had about 4) and none stood out.  Also, the sauce for the meat jun was the same for the man du and shrimp tempura.  Not bad for the most part, but it just did not go with the shrimp.

Despite the rolls and sauce, though, the place is totally redeemed by their udon.  It's been a while since we've found tasty udon in Vegas and this place nailed it.  It was so good that, even though it wasn't part of the AYCE, we ordered two bowls.  

For the kal bi alone, the AYCE was worth the money.  Add a bowl of udon to that and you've got yourself stuffed."}
{"text":"Lets just start off with the fact that im half Korean and cook half of the food they make here at Yum Yum from recipes passed down from my mother (who in all our minds, nobody cooks better than mom). The AYCE was $13.99 which still wasnt bad considering the assortment of items they were offering. 
-Kalbi 
-Katsu 
-Bul Kogi 
-Chap Chae 
-Man Du
-BBQ chicken 
-Garlic shrimp (shell on) 
-Misubi 
there is quite a bit
-about 15-20 different sushi rolls from spicy tuna to tiger rolls and everything in between 

Surprisingly the Kalbi marinade was on point and very good cuts of meat. Katsu was a bit thin for my liking but not bad just not great. Garlic shrimp was tasty but i hate having to work for my food so peeling the shell just pissed me off. BBQ chicken was grilled and good (not dry) but not sauced up just grilled chicken. Chap Chae was actually not bad considering its pretty easy to mess this dish up, thumbs up. I did have two sushi rolls but honestly it just didnt go with the rest of the meal, so i kept the heaps of meat, noodles, and man du flowing nicely. I will say for the price its hard to beat and coming from a guy who is really picky about his kalbi marinade they actually do quite well with it so dont miss out on that if/when you go. 
The place is small and in a strip mall sort of situation so dont be overly impressed with the outside appearance even though the logo is actually kinda cute. Its clean and to the point but not romantic or anything to really get dressed up or consider a date kinda spot as you just come here to get your grub on. Check it out!"}
{"text":"$12.99 (limited time only) FOR DINNER, can you believe it?! I don't think I can even get a mediocre buffet lunch for that price.

This place is conveniently close to the hotels which were off the main Vegas strip. And Yelp does wonders because 90% of the patrons who were there were out of towners. 

The nice thing about this place is that when you walk in, it doesn't reek of kalbi or any other meats It just smelled like... nothing, which is wonderful! The buffet menu came with a disclaimer: \"$3 charge for each dish of food you waste. Can only order 2-3 dishes at a time and can't order more till you're done with everything.\" I suppose that's a semi smart way to ensure large quantities of food don't go to waste. 

There was a mix of sushi ROLLS (rolls = 6-8 pieces of massive sushi) and your typical Korean stuff like kalbi (should get), bulgogi (can pass), volcano pork (can pass), etc. Our mistake was ordering 3 sushi rolls (didn't know they were rolls at first) during our first round. Oh boy - but luckily we passed it. There's also a mix of Hawaiian in it - garlic shrimp (highly recommend), spam musubi (tastes like any other spam musubi, but seriously... why would you order that when you're having all you can eat?), etc. 

Overall, this place is great if you're sick of the crab legs, cocktail shrimp and (nasty) prime rib at all the American buffets. The price is great as well!"}
{"text":"Cheap and good.  Their sushi is decent but I would stick to the cooked rolls.  I remember we got 6 rolls for take out and bill came out to $21 including tax.  The California roll was like $2.95.  You can't even get supermarket sushi for that cheap.

But their BBQ is by far the best.  So far I've had the chicken.  It's inexpensive and so flavorful.  I love the male server with the flower apron.  He seems to let the dirty dishes pile up at the tables, even when you push them to the edge.  He also can't grasp the concept of carrying more than two plates at a time.  He'll make a million trips just to deliver a few dishes.  But he cracks me up every time.  His floral apron makes me smile."}
{"text":"Wow, i found them. Yum yum bbq opened at a new location. It's at 7225 south durango cross street warm spring - next to sonic. Did the AYCE for 19.99 and drinks were included - Awesome!!! As for the food, it's always top notch when you do a cost comparison and compare it to the portion and taste of the food.  Enjoy all!!!"}
{"text":"first of all, went here for lunch and they were closed!  turns out they are moving to the west side of town.  so sad sad this was our go to place for a quick lunch.  sure, maybe their sushi is not top quality, but what Yum Yum lacks in quality is made up by price and size.  They have a sushi roll special, where if you order 2 or more selected rolls, they come at a discounted price. It's huge! like - put it all in your mouth and cover your face with a napkin cuz it's embarrassing - huge. 

They also have a decent AYCE menu, selection is limited, but it had all the things I normally get, so it didn't bother me.  I've had it a couple times, and found it to be better than if i had gone to Buffet Of Asia.  My go to items are the tiger rolls, crunch rolls, bento box combos and the chap chae.  good chap chae is hard to find!"}
{"text":"$12.99 deal for lunch or dinner is awesome.  Kalbi is soooooooo good.  Finger lickin' good.  Hawaiian garlic shrimp is buttery - ate shell and all.  Chicken katsu was crisp and tasty. Spam musabi was good, but too filling with the rice.  Volcano pork and bulgogi is good, but the aforementioned was awesome.  Owner was attentive and friendly.  Clean tables, clean bathrooms, 2 flatscreens - one with a kid show, other for adults.  Comfortable.  Would go definately go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Korean considering the value and quality of the food. I usually get the buffet (not a real buffet as in the food stations). This buffet is better because it is made to order. You pick a few items off the menu and it is made fresh and then order some more items off the menu. All for $15.99! I do hate it when others, who don't know Korean, food rate these types of places. I am a S. Korean and I know my food. Is it the best Korean ever? No..BUT it is pretty dang good for the value that you are getting. I liked everything on the menu and it tastes how it suppose to taste. Most of the food is basic Korean food done well. If you go a regular Korean al-a-carte restaurant, you will pay more. It is a good expierence for those who aren't sure what to order in a Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"For takeout meat-jun, this was okay but as I rated, I've had better.  

The lunch special price is a decent value for portion.  It even came with 4 banchan in normal portions - spicy cucumber, seaweed salad, bean sprouts, and what was either bamboo shoots or marinated daikon (I hate both so I didn't eat it - the rest was tasty though).

The batter was a little mushy.  The meat was pounded as thin as I have ever seen it, and the batter was thin too.  But you get a pretty big pile.  The meat tasted a bit old but was not gristly so I can live with that.  And it wasn't swimming in oil, so, plus there.  I would maybe go again since it's super close to my house."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!! I recently moved here to Vegas but since my daughter has lived here for the past few years, we found a place that has great Meat Jun. When I go in, the owner already knows what I'm about to order! Next time, I will surprise him and order the Bi Bim Bap...with a side of meat jun!!!!

This little palce is really clean and the food is always cooked to order. These guys make the best meat jun and kal bi and the bulgogi isnt bad either."}
{"text":"A couple of us stopped at Yum Yum BBQ last week in Airdrie after shopping at the Costco by Cross Iron Mall.  This little Korean chicken place is a favorite of one of my brothers and we can see why.  We ordered the popular Yum Yum chicken which was a very crispy crust chicken with a sweet sauce on it like Honey Garlic.  We ordered the meal deal which came with 3 pieces of chicken , crispy fries that stayed crispy and a drink.  We also tried the scallion chicken which do not have a sauce on it so that is a good choice if you don't like messy saucy chicken.  The spicy chicken was also crispy and tasty and not at all too spicy.  The meat was hot and not greasy at all.  The owner served us and was very friendly and helpful explaining about the food choices.
Great chicken and very Tasty !"}
{"text":"5 stars because for the AYCE price and quality of food, it cant be beat! service was friendly, not much conversation but i go there for the food. went initially because of the Yelp reviews, and i was SO PLEASED with the food!!! 

the kalbi was delightful.. definitely my favorite on the menu. man du was not too greasy/oily, i ordered two of that :) i like the fact that they allow only two to three orders per round (per person) (IOW: 2 people can order 6 dishes). the volcano pork was supposed to be spicy.. and it looked really spicy, w the red sauce.. but it was not spicy in the least bit. that's okay, because it was still okay to eat (i'd give the volcano pork a 6 out of 10). garlic shrimp was a pain to deshell, so i just ate it whole (and it was pretty good with the shells!!) chap chae was good too. kalbi and chap chae was my top 2. bulgogi was mediocre.. tasted like pure beef.. not much to it. spicy tuna roll was okay, but the love sushi roll was really good too!! 

overall, love this place. also you should know a few things before heading over there in terms of pricing: 
-if one person gets an All You Can Eat, everyone else at the table MUST get AYCE (no exceptions!)
-if you get AYCE, and you would to order some items that is not on the AYCE menu (such as bibimbap), it would cost $4 for the other items instead of the regular price. however, you would not be allowed to take those items (that are not AYCE) home if you can't finish it. if you decide to do some takeout along with your dining in, it would be regular price and not $4.00

can't wait to come back here when i get back to vegas!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, friendly service, the meatjun was very tasty, I'd love to go again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!! I'm from Hawaii and they have the best kalbi here!!! Even the meatjun is great!!! I've been  coming here for years and have not been disappointed once."}
{"text":"We rolled up on Tuesday before 8 pm and it was closed!  WTH!  I was starving and now I can't try you BBQ!"}
{"text":"Another gem off the beaten path. It's in the Wal - Mart plaza. 

The BBQ is actually a fusion of Hawaiian, Korean and Japanese.

Everything I tried so far is pretty good and believe me I tried alot last time. Next time I think I'm just gonna go with the AYCE for 13 bucks. 

This is mom and pop shop, never really seen it busy but thats probably because not many people know about it. 

The Chicken Katsu was pretty good and the Bul-go-gi kinda tatse like the fake beef from yoshinoya in a GOOD way. You know you love the meat from there even if you are unsure if it's real meat sometimes. 

Worth checking it out."}
{"text":"We drove about 15 minutes or so from the strip to get to this place, which isn't too bad.  It's located in a small strip mall type area, so it would be possible to miss it the first time around.  When we entered, it was fairly empty, which I didn't mind at all because that meant we would get our food faster.

I was with my friend and our girlfriends, and we all decided to do the buffet.  It was less than $15 each and we soon learned the price was well worth it.  We pretty much tried everything on the menu from the katsu to noodles to the musubis.  Everything was really good, especially the noodles and I believe it was spicy pork?  The only bad thing I had at this place was the sushi roll I ordered.  It had way too much mayo, but it wasn't so bad that it ruined my meal.  Besides, I didn't go there for the sushi anyway.

Overall, we were all satisfied with the meal and it is definitely a place I would come back tto.  Affordable, good food, great service.  What more can you ask for at a Vegas buffet?"}
{"text":"This place is my husband and mine's go to spot. We love the pork egg rolls, tiger roll, spicy tuna, bulgogi, and Hawaiian roll just to name a few. It is a great price for the all you can eat around $17 a person. We love to go to end a long week or a weeknight we don't feel like cooking. We love the service just as much as the food. Before we even order they are already making our food as they know us so well."}
{"text":"The chicken was amazing. I had the yum yum chicken and my fiancé had the BBQ chicken. Both have great flavor and not greasy at all. Can't wait to try the other chicken flavors and the other stuff on the menu. The couple behind the counter were very nice and friendly. 
I'd probably get takeout next time instead of eating in. We were the only ones in there while quite a few people got takeout while we were eating. The TV was too loud and it just would have been more relaxing at home while enjoying the amazing chicken. But I would definitely recommend the food."}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - Flavor - Aside from the garlic shrimp, nothing stood out too much for flavor. Most things were decent to good.
       - Variety - This is the only place I've seen serving Hawaiian, Korean, and Japanese in a buffet.
       - Value - They have the same price all day and since they raised their price to $15.99, it isn't as great a deal, but it definitely beats out most places for value at dinner time.
       - Rules - Though it says order 2 or 3 items per round and finish your plate before the next, they didn't enforce it as much with us. I'm assuming the rule is there for those who abuse the system.
       - I'd definitely recommend ordering the Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp, Kalbi, and Bulgogi.
       - If you like spicy, I'd say go for the Volcano Pork.
       - For all those sushi connoisseur (those who'd never order a California roll), I'd stay away from the sushi.
**Price**
       - $15.99 AYCE
**Ordered**
       - Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp - After peeling through two shrimp shells, I just started eating them whole. The shell is crispy enough to do so. This dish is very good and very buttery. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=TFhT4KvNPC_gsV2YchDiMA)
       - Bulgogi - A little dry compared to the grill your own Korean BBQ, but tasty. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=h9OXc15_aY8oCmYaEWFuxg)
       - Kalbi - Not as flavorful as L&L, but it's a buffet, so it wasn't bad. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=h9OXc15_aY8oCmYaEWFuxg)
       - Volcano Pork - This was a little too spicy for me. I guess they really meant volcano. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=uMofJGiHNph0pn2coNGEqA)
       - Chap-Chae - Clear noodles. Pretty good compared to other chap chae, but I don't really like chap chae. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=h9OXc15_aY8oCmYaEWFuxg)
       - Tempura Shrimp - A little too much breading on the shrimp tempura for my taste.
       - Spam Musubi - They use less teriyaki sauce than most places. I felt it a little bland.
       - Meat Jun - Thin slices of beef dipped in egg batter and fried. Wasn't my cup of tea.
       - Sexy Girl Roll - The spicy tuna was not very spicy at all. The rice-sushi ratio was a slightly high. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=KVndGIPsZ6wXYCwNM52g2w)
       - Alaskan Roll - A hefty portion of imitation crab in the middle. The salmon was not the freshest, but decent. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wtcMoqKiaxkFPZj0BC9jlw?select=vTJVUzj5mNzAkwvmT8zh2Q)
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a decent dinner buffet. The variety somewhat makes up for a slight lacking in quality."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times for lunch, each time doing the ACYE, which is $13.99 all day.
The ACYE comes with a little plate of macaroni salad, pickled beets, and sesame marinated bean sprouts.  Sometimes they bring out a bowl of rice and sometimes not.
I love the kalbi, man-doo, chap-chae, and the love sushi roll.  The bulgogi, bbq chicken, garlic shrimp and are okay.  
While they do have about 16 rolls on the menu, they are all a take on a california roll or a shrimp tempura roll.  

Over all, the ACYE is a pretty small menu but worth it if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went in on a Wed night (not very busy)....they have a special right now $16.99 AYCE all day so coupon we had was not needed.  They had the usual sushi rolls but for meat selection they had meat jun, kal bi an chicken katsu.  They also had spam musubi and pork or veg egg rolls.  For dessert only one selection and one time only of a single mochi ice cream.  Service was good and food was pretty good too.  Only thing is there is a charge for even a 4 yr old ($6.99)....most other places usually let a child that age eat for free.  Overall we would eat here again. *location is next to Sonic*"}
{"text":"The guy that answers the phone recognizes my voice......so I guess you can say I'm a fan since I order to go every Monday night before I head off to help out with my church youth group.

I honestly don't usually order rolls if I have a choice of sashimi/sushi....but I must say the dragon and tiger rolls are quite tasty here and extremely cheap at $6.99/roll.  Some places, the rolls have a not so fresh/fishy quality to them....but not here...the eel always tastes fresh, as well as the tuna.   The rolls are also ginormous in size....with that being said...I can still finish two rolls on my own easily =).  This is really a Hawaiian restaurant, I believe the owners mentioned they hail from Maui.... The Hawaiian selections that stand out are the meat jun (thinly sliced beef wrapped in fried egg) and bbq chicken.   I've tried the pork and beef options...but they seemed a little on the dry side for my liking.

I haven't had the opportunity to do the all you can eat option here...but for ~$15/person....I'm determined to do it at some point.  The AYCE menu consists of all their sushi roll options, the typical Hawaiian plate lunch options (kalbi, bbq beef, bbq chicken, volcano pork, katsu, garlic shrimp etc), tempura, spam musubi, and the list goes on. 

This is a pretty small establishment in a strip mall with a goofy monkey logo, but don't let that fool you...this place is definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Oh, how I love KFC (aka Korean Fried Chicken). The city of Calgary offers a couple KFC spots and Yum Yum is one of the better options (slightly better than Olive chicken but a lot better than Ogam and Wow chicken). The batter is light and crispy and the chicken pieces are nice and tender. This is a perfect snack when paired with a bottle of beer. I have not tried the other food options here, so I can't comment on it. Over the past 2 years, the prices have gone up, while the chicken pieces got smaller - but these portions are a good thing for people who have little self control when eating fried chicken (ie: me)."}
{"text":"This place has solid food.  The menu covers a wide array of foods, including Korean, Hawaiian, and Japanese.  But for general Asian food that's fast, this is the place to go.

I have tried their chicken katsu, bulgogi, volcano pork, and kimchee fried rice.  All of the above are really good, except the chicken katsu...it was a bit dry.  I would definitely go there again to quench my Asian food thirst."}
{"text":"Want it short and simple? Its like a little piece of chinatown in south vegas. If you are used to dodgy sushi places in chinatown, you'll feel right at home here. For me, the sushi is great considering the price is at least five bucks cheaper than any of the other sushi joints in the area. As for the smokeshop, well again, its pretty similar to a chinatown sushi place. If what youre looking for is a fancy show and flashy chefs, then don't go here, ya dum-dum!"}
{"text":"Found a flyer on my door for this place that had a \"Pre-Opening\" today.  Sushi rolls for $5, today only.  Why not?  I love sushi and this is a great chance to check them out.

First off, this is more of a deli than sushi bar.  You go to the counter to place your order.  Then sit down in one of the 6 tables and wait for them to bring it to you, or you can just get it \"to go\".

At $5 (normally $6-9) the portions are real good.  I ordered one each of the Dragon Roll and Alaskan Roll.  Both came with crab meat, just a bit more mayo than I prefer, BTW I'm not a big fan of mayo, so take that for what it is.  Each plate had wasabi and ginger, enough for me and a friend if we had 2 rolls each.  That is just way to much wasabi and ginger.  They are condiments, not garnishes.  Beyond that, presentation was excellent, the rolls looked fresh and appetizing. 

Now for the really bad.  Location, you hear this all the time, location, location, location.  And they picked a bad spot.  If you are familiar with this area, it's where the Jersey Mike's Subs used to be.  In a small strip mall away from the street.  With the Jiffy Lube and Sonic Drive-Thru surrounding it, you'll easily drive right past it.  Even looking for it, you can easily miss it.

With 808 and Sumo just a block away, this place will not be my go-to sushi spot for dinner.  Lunch, on the other hand.  With the speed the rolls came out, I can see me coming here for a quick roll on the run."}
{"text":"Finally, me and my sister got the chance to try out yum yum chicken, well its because of Colin. Thank you Colin.
We ordered # 11 which is beef, rice, 3 PCs of small dumplings, and 2 yum yum chicken, came with a can of pop, I think it was around $14(round up).
Let's start with the ambiance, its a small very comfortable place. The chairs are comfy. Nice decors.
Now, the service....great service. She asked us if its dine in or take out, with menus ready got us seated and came around at a great reasonable time to take our orders.
Order came, she did give our food without the chicken yet and explained why which is fine.
She was very very friendly for a Korean fast food and her English is really good.
Now with the food, its OK... My sis is right the portion size is alright. The chicken came in no time, according to them they cook the chicken with canola oil.
If I were to order again, I would order yum yum chicken. Its crispy very very crispy. There's a little spice in it which is a good touch I love it hence the 4 stars. 
I ordered half chicken to go it was around $12 which is almost normal price. I went to the mall for 2 hrs. Came home and had 1, holy it was still crispy. Crispy! Crispy still!
Holy cow, I can't believe it. Its not 100% like when it just came out, but I will say 80% which is still awesome for a fried chicken.
I would not order anything else but the fried chicken in the future!"}
