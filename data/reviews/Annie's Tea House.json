{"text":"I'vr tried bubble tea from everywhere and this is the best bubble tea hands down. Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"It is a gem in this plaza. I found this place while I am on my way to the food court. Small and cozy, well decoration. 
Juice/bubble tea was made from fresh fruit. I odered a honey dew juice with tapioca. The price is reasonable ($4.75 for a large size). 

I also ordered fish balls and beef balls. I like their fish ball over the beef becuase it is chewy and not too hard. 

I think i will come back one more time."}
{"text":"Off beaten but well worth the travel. This little bubble tea shop is hidden in an off-the-beaten path for me, but worth the travel. With so many bubble tea shops seemingly opening every few days, I am so glad to have had the pleasure of coming by this place. Annie's is a much needed break from the lazy generic bubble tea chain shop that is seemingly getting more and more expensive each day, yet offers less and less. This place is the epitome of quality and care. There's a different feel when I am ordering here. The staff aren't rushing through the orders, and will take the time to make it right. 

I LOVE avocado shake! It's a comfort food of my youth and yet so often I've been less than impressed with what I've paid for - most places undercut the avocado portion and fill their drinks with ice and cream, leaving the drink unpleasantly runny and lackluster. The first time I gave into my cravings, I held my breath and ordered it here, I was mind blown with what they offered. The drink with notably thick - not from fillers, not from artificial flavor or additives - just a lovely shade of fresh green ...delicious. The flavor was not watered down, and the sweetness is at the right level. This rings true for both the avocado shake and their avocado durian shake. 

I also tried their HK lover milk tea, essentially this is their version of the infamous Hong Kong coffee milk tea. It was good, not overly bogged down by the heavy use of cream and the tea and coffee certainly had a strong kick of caffeine. The only minor detail was that the level of sweetness can only be customized from less sweet, normal sweet, to more sweet; if you are the type to drink your caffeine sans sucre (like my fussy boyfriend) then you're a bit out of luck. Though he still admit it was quite palatable with the less sweet option.

Overall, the price-quality- and service will trump all. Affordable and uncomplicated, they are well worth the praise. Annie's should be at the top of the list for any fellow bubble tea obsessed companion."}
{"text":"This place is located in a very low key type of plaza. It's interior isn't the nicest, it only has one table with four chairs, and usually only one employee working. However, they offer a large variety of beverages such as milk teas, fruit juices, and slushes, and on top of that the prices are cheaper than the regular chatime or coco. I'd recommend this to people who are looking for a quick grab and go for boba considering it's mediocre interior but low prices."}
{"text":"The spicy food from One2Snacks made me search for something to cool my mouth with. My heart skipped a beat when I saw the sign for bubble tea in the same plaza.

Annie's Tea House was a God send. The owner worked here when the space used to be Fruit Jungle Bubble Tea. After 6 years working for them, she decided to open up her own shop this past November in the same space. Place looks so much better now than before: clean, cute and spacious. 

Lots to choose from and drinks made from fresh fruit. I chose the Pineapple - Coconut ice cream milk shake with tapioca pearls and the HK milk tea (iced) with grass jelly. I enjoyed the shake because it was not overly sweet and I could taste the natural fruit flavors used. Tapioca pearls were soft but still had some chew to them. The tea was strong and the grass jelly were in huge chunks.

So glad there's a reasonably priced bbt joint in this area that's NOT a chain."}
{"text":"Really this is the best place for actual real fruit bubble tea and you can't beat the price and size.  Absolute hidden gem and the woman that runs it is very nice as well.  The apps says this review is too long so really just go to this place"}
{"text":"First time here, love the hot honey green tea! ITS a must try!

Small supper here is actually good! had couple order of spicy beef balls and yam noodles.

Relaxing atmosphere, plenty of room for improvement as this place is not fully decorated.
Will be returning for more."}
{"text":"Great price for great juices and teas. Awful location, it seems this place is out of place with it's chill, trendy bubble tea lounge atmosphere in a weird, dated plaza. 
I ordered the avocado milkshake and it's just as good as any other but a buck cheaper. I asked for less sugar too and it was perfect. Like drinking an avocado."}
{"text":"This was OK.  Nothing to rave about.  My first pet peeve is that you can't ask for no-sugar or reduced-sugar - which leads me to believe that things are pre-made.

I have bad better.  I have had worse.  This was just OK.  The tapioca was not chewy enough.    Forget about even getting a smile or an acknowledgement.

Meh."}
{"text":"Today Special's Honey Green Tea for $1.99 + $0.25 for Tapioca.  

Price definitely is good at Annie's Tea House.  As you get what you pay for at a reason price. Tapioca was overcooked and lack the chewiness. 

Curry Fish's Eggs  ($1.75) Oh I mean Curry Fish Balls has 5 in an order.  (Maybe someone please tell Annie's to change the sign?) Spiced by chili oil but I wish for a little more curry taste. 

Seems like a lot of students are here for their bbt drink fix and some cheap snack food. 

Good if you are on a budget and want a quick drink."}
