{"text":"A brilliant little Korean restaurant that does take out.  Quality is great, so is the service.   I often order the bibimbap bulgogi and recommend it."}
{"text":"Disappointing - Food is good quality but the cooking method is NOT Korean BBQ. They put water between the grill surface and the heating component and add a piece of thin paper to prevent the food from sticking to the metal grill plate. The result is slow boiled meat and not fast BBQ cooked meat. It was like eating chinese HotPot. They allowed us to remove the paper after we complained and wanted to frequently change the grill surface to prevent charring on the plate. They also prevented us from going over level \"4\" on the grill heat setting when the max is \"8\". What!? You are operating a KBBQ restaurant... Of course the plates are going to char! It is your job to clean and buy new ones as needed!  Mon Ami, if you are reading this, there's a product called PAM that anyone who spends 5min in a kitchen will knows about. USE IT. Also, worried about the smoke? It's called setting up a proper ventilation system and not use \"water\" to steam the meat and limiting the guest on the heat output.  ONE LAST THING. If you want to set a defined tip percentage for \"groups\" (we were only 5), put it on the bill directly. Don't press the \"15%\" button for me when I'm paying by card. I will decide how much tips you deserve. Not you."}
{"text":"I went the mon ami on Décarie for supper with family during the week end. We all took the all you can eat option. Since the ventilation system the restaurant had couldn't take in too much smoke, the restaurant enforced a policy for all customers to only eat their food at a power of 5 out of 10. In addition, we had to use parchment paper on the bbq. This was unfortunate since the meat couldn't get the proper grill. The waiters appeared to be understaffed as well as the time to order and get the food took longer then most all you can eat restaurants.   I understand that each mon ami restaurant is slightly different so please understand this review only applies to this one."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, good service.  The fried chicken was cripy and tender with a hint of spices, good enough to take another piece."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch as a bunch of very hungry people and let me tell you that my family can eat its fare share of food! The waiter struggled a lot to serve our table of 17 plus all the other tables. I would guess that he had about 30-32 patrons for himself. Seeing that, we could get annoyed at him for messing our orders up. He was running back and forth non stop trying to do his job with a smile on his face even though he was having a hard time.  Food. It was good. Really. Considering the fact that it's an all-you-can-eat buffet. The meats were well seasoned and the veggies were fresh. I wished they offered more variety but at least the \"classics \" are there. Sad thigh is that there are no desserts as well. Maybe because it was the lunch menu. I would thought that 25$ could give you more.   So for me it was three stars but I made it four stars for the waiter's efforts!"}
