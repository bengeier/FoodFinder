{"text":"Love this place - always packed when I go which says a lot.  Jerk shawarma meal and jerk poutine are amazing - my go-to favs.  Always well staffed - busy and friendly.  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Best ever?  Even though I move to Markham I still drive almost 20mins to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Heard and read all the reviews ... the best jerk chicken I've tried in Scarborough the place is nice and clean and their staff prepare every dish with perfection . The cost of jerk chicken with rice and peas.. the rice they use is basmati which was delicious priced for $10.10 (10 out of 10)."}
{"text":"This place has the best jerk chicken and oxtail I've ever had! My favorite part of a combo is the plantains - just a great combo to the chicken or the oxtail. I've also had the jerk chicken poutine - it takes a whole lot of effort NOT to order this yummy combo! Great little takeout place in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Amazing! This is like the local secret hidden away in a plaza. The staff is amazing, very polite. Definitely in my top 3 jerk chicken places around Toronto. The jerk chicken is really good, good amount of sauce and they give very generous portions. The rice could be better but i am not bothered by it. Must try!"}
{"text":"Not bad ! I must say Chris is playing it safe with the jerk flavor 'coz it's 'foreign-ized' :)  I'll be back to try the jerk shawarma !"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is yummy! The people there are so friendly. I go there frequently and my fav is Oxtail."}
{"text":"The best Caribbean restaurant in Scarborough. Fast, friendly service with quality food.   I would highly recommend jerk poutine.  it's so fucking good! 5/5!!"}
{"text":"The food may not look beautiful but it is full of flavour and deliciousness.  I am a fan of the curried chicken dinner and my sisters love the jerk based vegetarian meals.  Must say I was pleasantly surprised.  Your portion will provide you with dinner and lunch the next day. Simply great.  Go try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken shawarma poutine, and the wrap. The flavours are really good, can be a little bit more spicy, but amazing nonetheless. That spicy mayo is to die for. Great spot."}
{"text":"Just had an incredible jerk veggie meal! It was so packed I will eat it 3 times over. It's so hard to find quality vegetarian food in the area - but no more! Amazing, thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken meal: jerk chicken, rice and beans, veggies, 2 plantain. I really enjoyed the flavour of the sauce, it is really good, well balanced. The chicken is a tad dry and the rice is pretty soft. But I haven't tasted their flavour of sauce anywhere else. We also got the poutine, which uses similar sauce for the jerk chicken. They add lots of sauce and cheese that is actually melted on the fries. The fries itself are very average. Overall it was a delicious meal and the portion is great for its price."}
{"text":"Wow. Had the jerk shawarma poutine and it was amazing... I rarely would choose to eat the same food two meals in a row but I would for that. Really good blend of gravy, jerk sauce. Cheese is stringy (more than just for 5 minutes) and homecut fries too. People there are super nice. Told the chef's sister how amazing the food was and the chef came out to thank us. My go to I'm scarb now.   WARNING: they sell out of their shawarma usually by 5PM. They are increasing supply, but shows just how good it is!"}
{"text":"After seeing friend's endless facebook pics and reviews I literally passed by this on my way back to the office and had to pull in to try out some of their food. Although I been tempted to try the poutine fries, I didn't think it would be good to eat before going back to work. Instead I tried the schwarma jerk chicken wrap.   WOwwwwww it was incredibly flavourful the chicken, the spicy mayo and hot sauce on top left an awesome after taste of spice!  Staff was friendly and really nice, this may become my next go to place and I'm tempted to go back tonight to get the poutine for dinner and may do so! lol  Since it was my first time, I am sure I will be back many times to sample all of their food!"}
{"text":"One of our favourite jerk joints in Toronto, a hidden gem in Scarborough. This place is famous for their jerk shawarma but I haven't personally tried it. I will say that the chicken breast jerk is one of the best I've tasted. Chicken is very tender, the veggies are fresh, the plantain is on point, rice is creamy, and the sauce is incredible. If you want good quality Jamaican food, Chris' Jerk is a place to try out. Call ahead of time for the Jerk Chicken Shawarma because they most of the time their sold out."}
{"text":"Statistically people that eat chris jerk live longer and have better lives. I order jerk chicken or ox tail w/ rice and peas on a monthly basis."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I havnt tried everything on the menu but have had most of it n it's all perfect every time. There is not one bad thing I can say other then maybe the food is so good that u might have a brief wait for ur food as it gets busy."}
{"text":"Pros: - Tastes great - A lot of food - Served really really fast (like i ordered and got my meal 30 seconds later, I ordered a jerk chicken meal at a time where no one was there.)"}
{"text":"I go here whenever I can. My dad and I have tried everything on the menu. Jerk Chicken and Pork is outstanding, and they have some delightful fresh fish specials on the weekends."}
{"text":"Deliziosso! Foods are amazing here, and the meal guaranteed to make you fuelled. Everything made fresh plus they served and cooked in front of you to male it more interesting. Lastly, the restaurant is clean n neat"}
{"text":"The jerk chicken shawrma dinner is amazing and highly recommended. I've told numerous friends and family about this place already. The wrap, curry, poutine, and everything else is delicious too. Quality is great and the staff is always friendly.  Only downside is they are usually sold out of shawrma before dinner and depending on the time the wait can be long."}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken dinner and it was really good. My friend had the boneless curry chicken and said it was really good also plus the way they present the plate is a definite bonus. You get a good amount of chicken and rice with steamed vegetables and some plantain. Will definitely be going back again. Wanna try the jerk chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good!  I came here hungry after a hockey game because the food looked really good on Yelp.   I ordered the jerk chicken dinner - it's about $10 and change but you definitely get your money's worth!  The rice is basmati rice instead of parboiled rice. Such a game changer with the rice and peas because it absorbs the gravy really well!  They give you 3 fried plantains which was a really nice touch! Most places will barely give you 1 let alone 3. They weren't crunchy or over cooked - they still had a very authentic banana taste. I are these first but wished I saved it for later.  I had 2 thigh pieces and a leg, all smothered in gravy. You can really taste the sweet and spicy hits of jerk seasoning and the steamed vegetables tend to absorb the flavour of the gravy when it's covered!  I ended up eating the chicken before the rice - this chicken was really well cooked for jerk chicken; it had flavour not just on the outside but the inside as well. Amazing!  The rice mixed with the gravy and leftover pieces of shredded chicken was what made me realize this place knocked it out of this world!  This place is well out of my way but the next time I find myself in North York, I'm going to make my way down for some delicious food! Can't wait to try the jerk shawarma and poutine next time!"}
{"text":"The best Jamaican food in the area! The oxtail  is fall-off-the-bone delicious! The jerk chicken is seasoned with the right amount of heat and is tender and juicy. I also recommend the curry goat and chicken wings. The meals that come with rice and peas, plantain and steamed vegetables are good value for money."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great food and great people. Try the jerk chicken shawarma but know that everything on the menu is great."}
{"text":"Wow!  The food here is really, really good!!  We tried both the jerk chicken dinner (excellent) and the curry goat (amazing) and both left us wanting to return. Living downtown we've tried few caribbean restaurants but none compare to this.  Huge portions, really nice staff combined with delicious yet inexpensive food.  A definite five star. The place is in a divy-looking mall but don't be put off by that.  We ate in - very fast-foodish set up - but were comfortable and the place was very clean.  Lots of people were coming in asking for their jerk shwarma but they were all sold out. We overhead the lady saying over and over again that it's usually sold out by 5 pm, so if you want to try this, be forewarned!!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff, tasty food, and good prices  The jerk shawarma wrap is my fave - you can choose what you want in it.  The jerk poutine is so tasty but like any poutine, it is a heart attack.  Jerk leg is the best bang for your buck - the owner ensures you get a large portion.  Really satisfied with this place except it's not opened on Sunday"}
{"text":"My office is near Chris Jerk and I go there for lunch every 2 weeks. This plaza is filled with international food. The jerk poutine is a special one! Can't find that anywhere else! It has a little kick of spice and wonderfully balanced with stringy cheese! Some days they are sold out by dinner time, and they give the option to upgrade to jerk chicken thigh."}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical about a place that sells Jerk shawarma. I wanted something authentic (Jamaican) and not some fusion or whatever. I ordered the shawarma meal and the jerk pork meal. Both were excellent. The gravy was tasty. The coleslaw fresh and tasty. The homemade hot sauce was fantastic. The chef at this restaurant had worked in Mediterranean restaurants and took some of those cooking methods to create a really wonderful jerk flavor. A delicious experience. DO it. Eat it. You will love it."}
{"text":"I know why they call it \"Chris Jerk\" and it's not because of the jerk chicken. The owner is a real a-hole who does not treat his customers with any respect, it's as if he does not care for business the way he often treats paying customers. I've seen him tell a group of students and volunteers that they must leave and cannot eat in his restaurant after purchasing meals. Completely disgraceful how he treats customers, especially those who are not adults. The owner Chris is an ageist, he does not want youths in his establishment even though that demographic is often the group who support his place, if it wasn't for them he would be out of business quite quickly.. Figure your act out Chris, paying customers are paying customers regardless of age.. Pay them the respect they deserve"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  I really do not know how useful yelp ratings are. I've been to some highly rated ones that were mediocre. My experience that is that rave yelp reviews will lead to disappointment. I, like many of us, have eaten food for a long time and very little blows me away. Maybe others are more generous with five star ratings. Almost every place I go is not bad to pretty good. Food around the world are just variations of the same thing: different grains, breads, meats and vegetables, so there is not much that is truly unique. I'm also of the opinion that if get really excellent food, often it is a fluke and you might not get the same on your second visit.  Anyway on to the review: we tried the oxtail and it is more expensive ($15.77 after tax for oxtail entree including plantains, peas, rice and some veggies) than other places I've been. I recalled liking the oxtail at Cravins better. The sauce was a little on the sweet side for my liking.  The place is busy and there are maybe 12 seats total, so you have to consider that you might not get a place to sit down and eat.  I might come back if in the area. I definitely would give it another chance but it is not heads and tails above what you can find elsewhere, so I would not go out of my way to eat there based on my first experience."}
{"text":"I think jerk chicken can be really subjective, so I'm not sure if this place is authentic or not, but I know that they cook and season everything from scratch and with love and it really shows.   Their jerk chicken dinner is very tasty, and the portions are very generous. The chicken was a bit dry, but I really like the jerk seasoning that they use here.  I thought the jerk chicken shawarma was really really good. It's not really 'shawarma' as it is more a jerk chicken burrito (to me anyways). The use of coleslaw gives it a much more refreshing taste, and they wrap it in a burrito style shell.   The jerk chicken poutine was a bit of a novelty item, but you can't really lose with fries, meat, cheese, and gravy (not made from powder).  When it gets busy the line doesn't move very fast, but that is because they actually make your food."}
{"text":"I know I don't have to go anywhere else for a chicken fix. Went in looking to try the jerk shawarma but it was sold out. Got lucky with half portions of both the jerk and fried chicken with all the sides, and I'm eternally grateful because both were amazing and I don't know if I could choose. Already planning my next togo meal - for the amazing portions at the crazy low prices charged, it's definitely going to be very soon."}
{"text":"Great Food ! Great people ! Love the Jerk Chicken Shawarma . So good"}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken craving satisfied with the Jerk Sharwarma Poutine at Chris Jerk. Can't wait to try out their stewed beef oxtail and curried beef. The owner and cook is very friendly, will be back soon. Lots of traffic with repeat customers."}
{"text":"Jerk shwarma poutine was my reason for going here and it didn't disappoint. The jerk chicken was flavourful and the gravy was the icing on top. This meal put me in a food coma right after.  My wife had the fried chicken meal, and of course I picked a bit of it. Everything was great except the fried chicken. It was a little disappointing that the chicken was cook already and kept in a steel container. So when biting the chicken the skin was a little stale and the meat a tad dry.  I enjoy caribbean dishes and ill definitely come back to this joint. Next time ill grab the ox tail or the goat.   Check this place out it's worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I came here a few days ago because I was craving some jerk. It's conveniently located in a plaza by Huntingwood and Birchmount that also houses some other great foods (Hunter's, the Taiwanese Fried Chicken shop, and Mexico Lindo to name a few.)   I've been to Jamaica and have tasted the real deal. While this isn't exactly it, it comes pretty close to it, and I'd have to agree it's among one of the top in the city, if not the top in Scarborough!   The Good: the jerk chicken meal comes in a Huge serving for about $9. Comes with about 3-4 pieces of well marinated jerk chicken (two big, two smaller sized ones,) beans and rice, some veggies, and my favourite: plantains!   The plantains here are THE bomb dot com, and I don't think I've tried better ones anywhere else in Toronto. I would come back here just for a large serving of those plantains alone. That's what dreams are made of.  The chicken itself is moist and well seasoned, and the servings are plentiful.  The Bad: Could the chicken and rice be a little more seasoned? Hmm, yes. The rice is lacking in flavour a bit, which would be alright if they gave you enough sauce, but they don't. I had to ask for extra, and the woman gave me a bit of attitude for it, reminding me that because it was my first time, She'd give me some, but that I'd have to pay the next time. This was after I'd purchased 3 large boxes and dropped over $30 on jerk chicken. Surely you can add a few extra scoops of sauce on to your jerk chicken? No? Okay.  The Ugly: Service is not the best here, except for the Asian guy in the back serving food. He always seems to be working really diligently to get stuff done. Otherwise, some of the people working behind the counter can be in a bit of a mood. They just look like they're totally \"over it,\" from both of my experiences here. If it's service you're looking for, then opt for Reggae Kitchen instead: amazing jerk chicken, great prices, and wonderful service (thanks Chris!) otherwise, Chris Jerk hits the spot and I'll most probably be back. :)"}
{"text":"Thanks Chris & Aretha you guys rock!  What an awesome Jerk Chicken, Fried Chicken, Curried rice and Ox tail dinners. Based on the numerous recommendations I had to bring my family back to the old neighborhood and we were not disappointed. All our dinners were packed and we could not eat it all! I would recommend Chris Jerk to anyone looking for the non typical chain restaurants. Mention that Lawrence sent you. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I drove past this place every single day and didn't try it until recently on a day off from work for lunch.  Great concept for the jerk chicken shawarma and it tastes great. Have tried other menu items which were also just as good. The only downside is that the first time we went here to try this place, the staff told us that the jerk chicken shawarma is usually sold out by 5 pm on the weekdays so not a good dinner option if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"This place impressed me with how new and clean it was. I ordered their signature jerk chicken shawarma wrap. The meat was nice and hot as they pan fry it just before putting it in the wrap. I ordered it with everything and it was made very carefully and the ingredients worked well.  If I were to nitpick, I would have liked the tortilla to be warm also.  I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Now I see what all the fuss is about. Don't expect great surroundings or beautiful spacious eating space. No this is about great food. Go in expecting great tastes on island time. In a hurry....go to McD's. Jerk chicken  with rice and peas is fantastic. Basmati rice is different but works. Jerk chicken shawarma is incredible. Great value. Enough food to warrant a nap afterwards. Will return."}
{"text":"Been back here a few times and I was never disappointed. The jerk shawarma poutine is amazing!!! I've also tried the entree meals (jerk chicken and jerk shawarma). Very filling. The shawarma runs out by the end of the day so best to get you some as early as possible!"}
{"text":"First time trying jerk chicken. .  It was amazing! Very delicious! Large portions friendly staff :) would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Last time I was here was a couple of years ago so that was before their recent renovations.  The seating area is smaller but it's the perfect place for a quick bite or for take-out.    Today I decided to try their BBQ Jerk Chicken Wings and lawdamercy! I'm a huge wing fan and will travel all over to try chicken wings and this is by far, one of the best flavoured wings I've EVER had.  Not only were the wings perfectly crispy and juicy, the flavour was just out of this world.  I'm a little sad that I wasn't as hungry but on a happier note, I have some to eat later on.  So if you're also curious with the portion, it was a very good portion. You get 6 to 7 pieces of good sized wings (both drums and flats), coleslaw, fried plantain and your choice of either rice & peas, steamed rice or fries.  I opted for the fries which were also very good! Imagine Costco fries.  Definitely a 5/5."}
{"text":"Very good!  Nice price for a tasty homemade food.  We tried the Jerk leg (chicken, spicy ) and the stewed oxtail (soft meat), both very good ,includes plantain and fresh brocolis  and carrot."}
{"text":"This place does a spin on west indian jerk cuisine with a middle eastern flair. The menu is varied and everything looks and smells delicious.  We came here on a random tuesday night late and it still had tables packed with people. Which is always a true testament to the food.  We only had the jerk chicken poutine but it was the bomb diggity bomb. Great smokey spit fire shawrma taste but with all the seasonings of a nice Jamaican jerk. Fries are fresh cut and not frozen. Nice beef stock gravy was rich with flavour. Cheese was nice but could have been a little more plentiful. But then again we are cheese monsters so there is never enough cheese for us. All in the place is nice. The decor is simple and the place is uber clean. The staff are also very pleasant and helpful. Come on up to the North Side of scarcity and try some chris jerk jerk chicken shawrma poutine."}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of Caribbean food but Chris Jerk does it right. The food is amazing and the portions are huge. Two people who eat an average amount would even be able to share one order. There is not much room to sit and the lines are always long but it is so worth it! The staff is always nice, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was good, decent serving portions. Jerk sauce is a bit too sweet. Don't go there to have a calm lunch/dinner. It's a pick up and leave place"}
{"text":"Chris'Jerk is located in the corner of a plaza at Huntingwood and Birchmount in Scarborough.  During my 2 visits, I've had the pleasure of watching chef Chris behind the counter, plating up some delicious Jamaican food.  The jerk pork, jerk chicken, and oxtail are delicious. Portion sizes are huge so come hungry. As other reviewers have mentioned, they serve basmati rice instead of the traditional parboil rice and peas. It somehow works tho! All dinner plates come with 3-4 pieces of fried plantain, steamed vegetables (carrots, broccoli, and cabbage) and your protein of choice. It is a lot of food, and it tastes healthy and home made.  My second visit, I came for the jerk chicken shawarma poutine. TIP: it sells out quickly, so come before dinner time to get some. The chicken itself is well seasoned, cooked perfectly. It is mostly dark meat, and it complements the poutine well. The fries stay somewhat crispy after having shredded mozarella cheese and gravy poured on top.  Chris' Jerk is serving some hella good comfort food! - You can call ahead for pickup!"}
{"text":"Funny thing is they only have limited food. We came there twice different times for jerk chicken shawarma they are always sold out. Customer service sucks as hell. As a business person and business aspect if the customers like the product make more. So that you can satisfy everyone not have it limited waste of time!"}
{"text":"Its so good that when its closed or I get there realizing its not open I get pissed lol Sooooo delicious, jerk chicken poutine is the truth and my favorite is the jerk chicken wrap. Im extremely picky with Caribbean food, not everyone makes it up par from what we know at home but honestly this spot takes the cake!!! Go before 12:00 or the line is out the door!  Ive told all my friends to go here and now everyone is hooked."}
{"text":"Friendly service but the food is not authentic Jamaican food. Their rice and peas is not authentic at all, looks like long white grain rice with minimal peas in it. Not satisfying for a real Jamaican to eat. Jerk chicken was a joke, not authentic at all. The minimal salad they give you is a joke too. And the amount of fraudulent rice and peas they give you is minimal for the money. I wouldn't come back here, severely disappointed. The chef is a joke too, you'll know what I mean if you go there. If you're in the area of Birchmount and Huntingwood and you feel or need some real Jamaican food, go to this spot at Kennedy and Huntingwood named P Jay's Take Out. It's one light north of Huntingwood on Kennedy. They are the real authentic deal for Jamaican food. Trust me, I'm a real Jamaican from Jamaica. And if you're on the south side of Scarborough, try this joint named twice as nice. They are truly authentic Jamaican style good right there. That was my one and only favorite spot for real Jamaican food until they closed for renovations. Btw, twice as nice is open again and looks better than ever. Don't waste your money at Chris"}
{"text":"Easily the BEST jerk chicken joint I've ever had. Not only is the jerk chicken great, their fried chicken and oxtail is also really good ! Any time I'm craving for jerk chicken-Chris's Jerk is my go to spot. This place gets very busy so you can expect to wait a bit but not too long because the staff  try to deliver quick. Usually people get their meals to-go as seats to dine in is very limited as it is a small joint."}
{"text":"if i could rate this place beyond 6 stars i definitely would! the jerk chicken shawarma poutine is outstanding!! i love it!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night at about 7:30pm and most of the menu items were sold out - I wanted to try the ackee and salt fish, but dang, it's only available on Fridays and Saturdays (agghhh, another reason to hate Mondays-Thursdays!).  The hubs got the jerk chicken, and I chose the beef oxtail instead.  The jerk chicken's OK, I found it to be...\"foreigner spicy\", as I once read another restaurant describes it.  As in: it's really not spicy at all.  It's still not bad though, the chicken was pretty tender on the inside.  The oxtail was quite pricey at $12.99, but I preferred it to the jerk chicken I had tried.  I liked the sweet plaintains and the buttery rice, which the take-out menu says contains coconut cream (no wonder it tastes good...).   I'll come back and try the jerk chicken schwarma and poutine next time, which seem to be the star items anyway.  If you plan to come here and try these items too, come here before 3:00pm as they're usually sold out by then."}
{"text":"Been here a few times had never been disappointed. Tried the chicken shawarma, jerk chicken and oxtail all very good. Like one the poster said earlier is a hidden gem in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Healthy options! You can order any meal and replace the rice with veggies. Love this. Jerk chicken breast with fresh veggies."}
{"text":"Thinking about the jerk shawarma has me salivating. I got the jerk chicken shawarma meal and jerk chicken meal. Nothing special about the jerk chicken meal, it the jerk chicken shawarma meal is what I will definitely be back for.  Large portion, came with vegetables, fried plantain, rice and of course the jerk chicken shawarma.The only downside was the extremely long line. I got there around 1:30pm on a Thursday afternoon and had to wait 40 minutes for my food... but it was definitely worth the wait. The Chris jerk hot sauce is really good as well, picked up 2 bottles on my way out. I saw a lot of people order the jerk chicken shawarma poutine, will definitely be back to try it."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Chris Jerk...run to it now!!! Must try carribbean restaurant with awesome fresh goodness and excellent service. Never had jerk chicken that tasted so fresh. Their house jerk sauce is perfectly delightful and compliments the chicken real well. If you want to add a bit of kick to your meal, try their hot sauce. Very satisfied with my experience.    P.S Try their shawarma poutine....if it's not sold out for the day."}
{"text":"My favourite local Caribbean  joint. Not only because their jerk chicken is the best in the city, but also because their service is top notch. They're all so welcoming and if you catch Chris himself, you'll usually find him behind the grill greeting everyone with a smile.   Their portions are very generous and they don't skimp on gravy and coleslaw like some other places.   If you're feeling extra hungry and adventurous get the jerk chicken wings....UH-MAZING! If you want to take a picture of the best poutine ever get the jerk chicken poutine.   7 stars out of 5...and trust me...I've had my fair share of jerk chicken!!! HAAN!"}
{"text":"Found myself in Toronto for about 3 days, I was in the mood for some jerk chicken, after driving about 20 minutes from downtown after having worked out an appetite by walking all around, I decided to search for a spot to satisfy my jerk chicken craving.  After searching for a few spots, I found this gem on what seems to me like a suburban area, parking is plenty since it's located in a small plaza. I walked in and there were a few people ordering but it was moving fast, I ordered what I came in for and waited about 5 minutes, decided to take my food back to my room since they only have like 3 tables and they were all occupied.  The chicken was a bit mild, not too spicy, they serve it with a few vegetables and a bunch of rice, more rice than anything else, overall it was good food, hit the spot."}
{"text":"Always my favourite go to place for Caribbean food. Be prepare for lineups Monday to Friday at 12, because this place is popping. Limited amount of seatings available, but don't let it turn you away.  Staff are really nice, first time I went and didnt know what to eat, helped me start off with milder tasting food (not Caribbean hot)... Can't stop going back to try other item of the menu. Eat anything with a Ting beverage."}
{"text":"This is almost the best jerk I've ever had. More specifically it is the best jerk chicken dinner I've ever had... For only eight dollars it comes with amazing peas and rice with the delicious spicy sauce with just the right amount of heat ad incredible aftertaste, and some salad, and some fried plantains which were perfect------ best of all of the jerk chicken itself was absolutely fall off of the bone perfect and the best arrangement of spices I've ever had. Unfortunately I also had high expectations for the $14 ox tail dinner but I found the meat full of almost entirely bone and gristle -there is very little meat at all. Mr. jerk which is a block from my house in Unionville has better ox tail - But again the spice was very delicious and the sauce which was on top of the peas and rice almost made up for it. We also bought their famous poutine with swarmer which was great, except for one small issue of me finding a large chicken bone mixed with the fries. I don't really know why there's a chicken bone in schwarma poutine but... It was a worthwhile risk for a great dinner and friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"Yelp strikes again. Hungry and in an unfamiliar area, checked Yelp and ended up at this amazing place. Had the excellent jerk chicken meal which came with a few pieces of jerk chicken, rice and peas, steamed vegetables and freshly fried plantain. All for $8.95. This place is busy and I know why. Mostly take out but there are several small tables to eat in. Bought some hot sauce to take with me. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great value and so much flavour! Ordered their bbq jerk chicken tender with steamed veges and you bet that chicken breast was defiNitely tender and juicy! Sauce was so flavourful, and not too spicy. Husband ordered their curry chicken with rice and devoured it in minutes! Everything felt homey from the recipes, food portions and the friendly attitude of the staff! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Got the jerk chicken meal and the shawarma meal. I liked both and thought they were both quite good, but definitely enjoyed the shawarma meal more.  Will definitely come back and get something with the coleslaw tho, because it looked great."}
{"text":"Finally checked out Chris Jerk. Ordered the trifecta of beef oxtail, jerk chicken and shawarma poutine. My favorite was the beef oxtail, which I highly recommend. I still prefer Rap's jerk chicken - I found the one here lacking in smokey taste, but it is very tender and juicy. The poutine in the shawarma poutine was good but the shaved shawarma was dry.   Beef Oxtail Entree ($13.95), Jerk Chicken Entree ($9.95), Shawarma Poutine ($8.95)"}
{"text":"The smell of the Jerk seasoned chicken draws you in to this place! The staff are friendly and the food is amazing. You've got to try the Jerk Chicken Shawarma - they sell out of it everyday so make sure you get here early."}
{"text":"Love this Scarborough joint. Service with a smile and staff that are genuinely happy to serve you up their yummy dishes. Had the oxtail with a side of a jerk chicken leg and it was enough to feed two. Their hot sauce is made in house and is delicious. We ended up using a lot of hot sauce because it was so good and we like spicy food. Without the added hot sauce, it is mild enough for those that can't take heat to eat without whining!  Lol. I'm picky with oxtail as it's usually priced as a premium dish and I hate it when it's a bunch of small bones with little meat. The pieces here are all big with a good amount of meat on them. They got it all right here: friendly service, good food, hot sauce, portion size and price point. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"So good~ SO so so good! Sosososo yummmy!  Definitely have to try this place! they have so much variety of Jerk....  I ordered the quarter leg jerk chicken meal for 8.95 and it was delicious!! so yummy i love the rice ! love the chicken !  love the flavor ! and the bananas are truly my fav! so yummmy~  Also ordered a shawarma Jerk chicken poutine which is super duper good if you love poutine and in my opinion its so much better than NY fries and much more worth it!  Also the service was super friendly and optimistic! such wonderful nice human beings"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten that much Caribbean food before, so am by no means an expert. I did think that this place was pretty good though.   The Jerk Chicken Shawrama Wrap tasted great. I actually think this is more like a burrito than a Shawrama (in fact the prep stage reminds me of Chipotle). The chicken tasted good, but I think that I most enjoyed the sauce that they use (I chose Smoky BBQ). I think it would be pretty filling for lunch. If you hungry though, you may need more (at least I did).    Goat curry plate was also good. The goat was cooked well and curry tasted nice. I didn't like the rice at all though.   One funny thing is that the menu on the board says \"Smiles.... free\", but ironically the lady manning the counters didn't crack a smile the whole time I was there (in fact, she looked a little depressed).   Quite a few people there on a Monday night.  Ample parking out front Accepts credit card"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken shawarma. As if shawarmas couldn't get any better, this placed decided to mix things up and offer a jerk chicken version of it. It's delicious. They also have regular jerk chicken plates which you can get, or a jerk chicken shawarma poutine that just looks over the top. I'm not sure any work would get done after eating that so I'll just stick to recommending the jerk chicken shawarma for lunch. Limited seating so great for takeout."}
{"text":"Got the shawarma poutine and it was amazing!! definitely recommend this place. food is always fresh"}
{"text":"Perfect review for this amazing Scarborough find. I was visiting a friend at the hospital and was looking to grab a late dinner. I remembered I had bookmarked this place as I'll be leaving Scarborough soon. There was only one person ahead of me ordering about four dinners and after me a few people started coming in. I got the jerk chicken dinner with extra sauce. It came up to 10 bucks with taxes. My goodness it was so delicious. It was not dry or overcooked. It was a huge portion including vegetables and three large plantains. It had a good amount of heat but the fresh pepper sauce they had complimented it so well.  It was so filling and way more than enough for one person. This review is making me want to go out and get some right now. It's that good!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute place its small but the food is awesome. I wanted to get the Shawarma but they ran out of shawarma so  they made me an alternative Jerk chicken with the poutine. It was still amazing.  I absolutely loved it and price is reasonable. Plenty of parking is available."}
{"text":"came here once at 8 on a Saturday and they had run out of shawarma so I came back on a Monday around 3 and they barely had any left but I managed to grab a shawarma wrap as well as a poutine. the wrap was good however the poutine was amazing! the gravy is so delishhhhhh!! and the fries stay crunchy even though they're smothered in gravy. I did remove once star just due to the fact that you'd have to get here before 5 to even be able to try the meat as its so popular it runs out really quickly. but definitely give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"My goto place in the area for oxtail/jerk chicken. Im so lucky to be living a block away from this place. Oxtail is very tender and flavorful. Jerk chicken is good too (although I've had better from Raps at eglinton west..but going there is an adventure on its own). You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time to get jerk chicken takeout.  The meal came with rice, plantains, gravy, and some veggies. The chicken was very well spiced and moist.  The gravy and rice delicious!  Portions are also pretty generous.  I will definitely be back next time I have a Jamaican food craving."}
{"text":"When I am craving Caribbean food this is my go to restaurant. The jerk chicken dinner meal is the best I've had here. Another must try is the jerk chicken leg poutine! Omg best of both worlds combined!  Keep in mind that this place has limited seating. It's more of a take out place. There are a couple of tables for two people and some individual seats by the counter looking out the window.   Food 10/10  Service 9.5/10"}
{"text":"Service great... friendly and patient staff especially when you have questions about the menu. Been a couple of times.  I have had jerk chicken swarma dinner, jerk breast dinner and the swarma pouring.  All were super fresh and amazing!  You must go!"}
{"text":"The jerk chicken breast poutine is my new fave!!! So happy I discovered this place after reading all the good reviews. I personally prefer the jerk chicken breast over the jerk chicken shawarma, but on weekends they usually do sell out of their chicken shawarma if you go in the late evening! I tried both versions and both are very delicious, the poutine gravy is very flavourful, the chicken is cooked so tenderly and the cheese just melts right in your mouth!! Best cheat meal ever, no regrets."}
{"text":"Amazing food, also probably the reason why they always run out of chicken shawarma before evening. We went at 5pm on a Friday and they were sold out. We ordered the jerk poutine and it was great. Great flavours, jamaican taste, not spicy, a bit sweet. Great combo. They added a chicken breast (you can choose between breast or leg) instead of the shawarma. They also have this hot sauce that they make there, and it's spicy... really spicy. Think ghost peppers. I would def return here again, maybe a bit earlier next time. The place is exceptionally clean, the staff is pleasant, and the food is tasty. What more can you ask."}
{"text":"I've known about this place for a really long time but have never had the opportunity to try it...until last week. We ordered two jerk chicken meals and I must say it wasn't as amazing as I had been expecting. The food was still really good but for some odd reason I didn't feel as if it had much flavour. One thing i can say is that their servings are huge. However, looking at all the other reviews I may have gone on an off day, so it could have been my bad luck. Will definitely give this place another go just to be sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! Portions were a good amount and love the jerk chicken, rice and peas and vegetables. This place is a crowd favourite as there was a long lineup and many people ordering takeout"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken and curry goat I ever had, period! Plus fresh veggies too if you get the dinner combo. Food for the soul!"}
{"text":"Only had the jerk shawarma poutine, but it was TASTY!  Only letdown was the shredded cheese instead of proper curds...  will definitely go back to try other treats!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, good flavours, and great value for the Jerk chicken dinner. Yum! The only thing I keep wanting to try that seems to be sold out or that they don't have when I dropped by was shawarma fries. Hopefully next time!"}
{"text":"Tender and moist chicken that was well balanced with spice and flavour makes this place a home run! Got take out for lunch after hearing recommendations of how great the food was and it certainly held up to the hype. Next time I'm in the area, I'll certainly stop by and will be passing on the recommendation for those seeking excellent Caribbean grub! :)"}
{"text":"You get quality and quantity here, the staff are friendly and the food is always fresh. I think I've been coming here since they opened at least 2-3 times a month just because the food is so good. I've tried the jerk wings, jerk chicken dinner (what I usually order), jerk chicken breast, jerk shwarma dinner, and poutine. Still waiting to try to ox tail but EVERYTHING SO FAR IS AMAZING! If you're in Scarborough you have to come here it's well worth the trip.   Keep in mind that during lunch hours they're usually pretty busy but the service is quick and efficient so you won't have to wait long, seating is minimal but it doesn't make a difference to me as I always do take out. Also the extra cost for gravy is worth it and I recommend the hot sauce too! So good! You definitely won't regret eating here and I'm positive you'll return too."}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken, flavorful and juicy! Not a large establishment with few seats. Luckily we found enough for us. Mostly take out place, started to fill up as soon as dinner time came. Amazing value, $11 approx. for the jerk chicken combination which comes in 4 pieces chicken, vegetables, fried plantain and rice. Lots of food for one person. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am taking claim to be the inventor and the first to order the jerk poutine topped with curry chickpeas....oh em gee....was SOLID...you are welcome to everyone who tries it..."}
{"text":"Their jerk chicken is amazing!!  And to serve it on top of a poutine, just takes it to the next level!  $8.40 all in, for a jerk chicken poutine."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken wAs not flavoured enough... Rice was overcooked... I am a fan of \"real jerk\" and \"Chris\" was not that great! Pricy $8.95/(1/4 chicken +rice/veggie)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Jamaican style cooking in Scarborough.  This is not your traditional style Jamaican style cooking as the jerk is not as spicy as other places I've tried.  Also, the rice is more of a basmati style rice whereas more traditional places seem to use a shorter grain rice with heavier notes of coconut milk.  With that being said, I come here an average of twice a week for takeout dinner after work.  If it is available, their Jerk Chicken Shawarma is incredible.  All the flavour you expect from Jerk Chicken but none of the bones to deal with.  I typically get the shawarma meal, but their shawarma poutine is also delicious.  I tend to avoid the shawarma wrap because I want more food.  My go-to meal is the Jerk Pork as it is much heartier of a meal.  The portions that they give out of their Jerk Pork is very generous.  IMO it is worth the extra $2-3 you would pay over the Jerk Chicken Leg dinner.  I have also had their Baked Jerk Salmon dinner which comes with a side of callaloo.  The salmon portion is pretty generous (approximately 8oz if I had to guess), and was moist and flavourful.  I was not the biggest fan of the callaloo, but I think that was personal preference as I had never had it before Chris Jerk.  There is limited seating, so do not come here with more than 2 people and expect to sit together."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a quick bite. It's more of a take-out joint since there's only a couple of seats.   The shawarma poutine is definitely a must-get here! The jerk chicken is made on a rotating pit. Overall flavourful and juicy meat. The fries were fresh and the poutine was topped with loads of gravy and cheese. Great dish!  We also ordered the jerk chicken shawarma wrap. 2 sauces are available in the wrap and I asked for both. Hot sauce is also available and I got it on the side. The wrap was so juicy that it got messy! This must be eaten when it's fresh or the meat juice and sauce will make the pita soggy. Again, the jerk chicken is wonderful -yum!  It was around $9 per dish which is quite reasonable for the portion you receive. Friendly service and it can get busy during lunch hours. Definitely coming back for all my Caribbean cravings."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I wish there are more places like this in the city (and in more visible areas).   Came in during lunch time and it was packed. I had to wait 30 mins for my order. I guess I came in during the peak time so buyer beware.   Of course I wanted to try the jerk chicken. Decent portion for the price and comes with plantain and some veggies. Most importantly the taste is very good. If you have tried jerk chicken elsewhere, this will probably be a delightful improvement over whatever you have tried elsewhere.   Honest small business. I fully support. I just wish it's more accessible from my work place or they open another location."}
{"text":"With the stellar reviews & my love for JA food, I could not pass up a visit to CJCB. A very comfortable, clean & welcoming atmosphere. Prices are a tad higher than avg but totally worth it imho. I Really Really enjoyed the Jerk Chicken Shawarma Poutine..I mean REALLY!!   Thumbs up as well for the Jerk Chicken meal with the added veg & fried plantain which nicely rounded out the overall flavour profile of the dish. I would prefer a little added spice/heat but that's what their in-house hot sauce is for I guess. When you add the extremely friendly, beautiful & speedy service...You have a winning combination.  Well done team CJCB!! A++ Just be sure your next location is in Markham  Will definitely be back to try their Fish, Oxtail & Goat dishes."}
{"text":"This place is pretty casual, a corridor-like layout with a chalkboard menu. The food is delicious!! Very filling and the jerk chicken recipe is obvious that it's been mastered. Fried plaintains are awesome! The poutine is so yummy and addicting! for 7.45, you get a takeout box of crispy fries, stringy cheese, spicy gravy and a generous helping of jerk chicken. It's to die for. The wait is sort of long but that's cause they make everything to order. Go here if you want to indulge in some nice, filling spicy food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Randomly went here after the gym one night (yes I like to reward myself for a good work out).  We ordered the jerk chicken shawarma poutine and wrap to split between two people. We had no expectations and were deliciously surprised. It's reward food at its best. And the unique idea to have jerk chicken as shawarma is original and genius. The portions are fair for the price. Although they've raised prices since my first visit, I still come back for more. It's that good!! I have tried other things in their menu and they never  disappoint. Be prepared though, if you don't come early enough,  they run out of jerk chicken shawarma fast!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, I got wind of this place after my brother came home with their poutine   This time I had the jerk chicken poutine. First off the quality and quantity for the price was a good  The topping of chicken, was so tender, the amount of cheeese and gravy was magical. The fries on the there own was a bit of let down, they were alright but eating them solo wasnt the best  All and all a great meal"}
{"text":"Love this place. Jerk chicken shawarma poutine... worth all the calories. Probably the best poutine fries I've EVER had.... ever. Amazing product. Only other item I have had here is a side of oxtail... good but damn that poutine.......damn"}
{"text":"I found this place while searching for some good eats around where we were. How thankful I found this place!  Don't be fooled by the exterior! The food here is just relish! We ordered Jerk poutine and jerk shawarma. My gosh how yummy both were! For the poutine, it was the right amount of cheese, gravy and the jerk chicken was just so good! The Shawarma comes with veggies and rice. Everything is as good as it looks!   Verdict? Must try! Especially, since it made the top caribbean eats in Toronto on BlogTO..If that doesn't make you want to try it I'm not sure what will!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time visit and definitely not my last! I Had the vegetarian Jerk. Veggies included were carrots, broccoli, onions, cabbage, tomatoes and chick peas, served Over rice and beans. The flavour was out of this world goodness. The jerk seasoning was not over the top spicy hot which was perfect for me. The portion was great as well I have leftovers for my lunch tomorrow :-)"}
{"text":"If you come here, I need to emphasize, you must get the jerk chicken shawarma poutine! It is heavenly and the quantity is awesome. You can ask for more of the sauce too.  Service is nice and quick. They really have a lack of seating and they sell out of the poutine way before dinner time, so get there early. It's more of a takeout joint (limited space for tables) so take your order to go and your mouth and stomach will thank you.  Never judge this dinky little plaza by how it looks outside, most people would just drive past it. Really a hidden gem. At least four great cheap eats here including: Chris Jerk, Hunters Pizza/Souvlaki, and the Vietnamese & Mexican restaurant. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"My first time here after seeing the reviews . I gotta hand it to all the staff here . This is the most outstanding Caribbean food, customer service not to mention a real inviting and mellow atmosphere. I hope the owner opens a bigger restaurant for a larger group.  Thumbs up to you guys your doing great !"}
{"text":"I ordered the jerk chicken dinner. It was so amazingly good. The jerk chicken was spicy but not overpowering the flavour of the chicken. I think the best part was the rice and peas with the gravy. It is the best I've ever had. They use the long grain rice I think instead of the shorter one. It was probably the best rice and peas I will ever have. My friend had the goat curry dinner, which wasn't so spicy and very very delicious. I think I'm going to be a regular here from now on."}
{"text":"An absolute must is the Jerk chicken poutine. Mine was flooded with a generous amount of dark savoury gravy. You'll be really full afterwards because the portion size is massive."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had a jerk chicken lunch combo (comes with rice and peas, fresh blanched veggies, and plantains). Great jerk spices, not deathly spicy like other places but good dry heat. Also appreciate the portion size, nicely arranged crunchy veggies, and three pieces of plantain. Rum cake was delicious too. Would return to try jerk shawarma and jerk poutine.  Atmosphere is clean and bistro-like with bar and standard tables."}
{"text":"We noticed this restaurant while going to the viet restaurant once day noticed a decent line up so we decided to check out the reviews on Yelp and planned to visit another day. Today we went by around 8pm, no line up, to grab some dinner. Was really looking forward to trying this place based on the raving reviews. We were looked at and then ignored upon entry. We tried to order the jerk shawarma but was advised they were sold out. After asking what they recommended, the lady said, \"everything is good\". Stuck between the oxtail and curry goat, I asked the lady for her opinion and she said, \"if you want goat, get the goat. If you want oxtail, get the oxtail\". I chose the oxtail. My roommate chose jerk chicken. Everything was already prepared on the hot tables ready for them to scoop and pack but our food was not ready for us for another 20minutes. We had our food at home and the oxtail was sweet and bland, rice was not seasoned, vegetables were just blanched. The jerk chicken was dry and spicy and house gravy was not tasty. If you are looking for good Jamaican food, stick to the hood (mainly in the Jane/Wilson) area. Looking at my roomate's jerk chicken made me immediately miss Willy's jerk. I will probably go there tomorrow to satisfy my Jamaican food craving as Chris Jerk was a disappointment. Would not come back due to slow service and bland food. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Lunch at Chris Jerk.  Ample portion; rice on the soft side; chicken cooked to perfection with the perfect texture; taste for the general palate; if you are looking for spicy and hot, look elsewhere, although you can request hot sauce on the side; cashiere and employees on the serious side; eat in or takeout. Variety of dishes available. Disclaimer: I met Chris, the owner of Chris Jerk at the time he opened the restaurant.   He's a friend of a friend."}
{"text":"I think I have a poutine curse on me, can't find one I'm satisfied with. Chris Jerk is widely raved on Yelp so  my expectations were pretty high for a slam dunk poutine that would blow me away, unfortunately I left slightly disappointed and still hungry for more food from somewhere else.  Jerk Chicken Shawarma Poutine for about $7.45. First glance after opening the container, my thought is the portion isn't on par with the price. I expected a stuffed container and much more chicken than I received. Flavour is okay, didn't blow me away and I wanted to be blown away. But note the staff are very polite and everything is made fresh, they deserve recognition for this.   This place does pretty good for business so others don't feel the same as I do. This might just be a place that isn't suitable for me. Give 'em a shot for one of their curry dishes with the plantain."}
{"text":"Food was great. Had the curry goat and oxtail. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Chris Jerk Caribbean Bistro recently opened around the corner from my house and Caribbean food has always been one of my favourite cuisines, so I definitely had to try the food to see if it was authentic. I grew up around a lot of Jamaicans and have frequented most of the Caribbean restaurant/take out places around the city, so I think I have a fair understanding of what good Caribbean food should taste like.  Chris Jerk Caribbean Bistro imo is a hidden gem in Scarborough. I ordered the jerk chicken quarter leg meal ($7.95 plus tax) which came with rice and peas covered in oxtail gravy, vegetables (carrots, cabbage, broccoli) and two pieces of fried plantain. It's reasonably priced for the portions you are receiving and most places charge extra for fried plantain. The rice and peas were moist but not too moist and the jerk chicken was really good, inside the meat was moist and juicy and the outside had the right amount of seasoning with a nice little heat kick that didn't go overboard.  The menu is quite interesting as they do have some dishes that offer a modern twist on traditional Caribbean dishes like jerk chicken shawarma and jerk chicken poutine but the next time I go, I definitely want to try their oxtail.  If your looking for a traditional Caribbean meal or something with a modern twist, I definitely recommend Chris Jerk Caribbean Bistro, the food is fresh, good, reasonably priced and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"Love their jerk chicken shawarma wrap! One of my favourites in the city. And they make the best hot sauce!"}
{"text":"No matter where you are from its worth the trip for the jerk chicken poutine. Nuff said. You won't be sorry"}
{"text":"Yes, I did it.   I drove an hour through the hail storm during April of 2018 to try this establishment. Over the course of two months, a friend of mine kept raving about Chris Jerk. He was particular on ordering the Jerk Chicken Schwarma. He mentioned it is the best Jerk Chicken in town. Being the skeptic that I am, I had to try it.  I arrived at 7pm only to find out Chris was sold out of Schwarma. I've been warned this is a common issue. Therefore, I ordered the Jerk Chicken Dinner along with a side of Jerk Chicken Poutine.  Here what I liked: - Inexpensive meal with moderately large portions. The dinner comes with rice, choice of side, plantain, jerk chicken - Gravy was abundant and had a lot of flavour - The poutine is one of the best poutines I've tried. Very crispy fries, similar to popeyes fries that softens with gravy. Amazing poutine - Coleslaw was fresh and tasted great  Here's what I didn't like: - The jerk chicken. Sadly, I was not a fan. My meal was not hot and had some cold parts around it. The chicken itself was on the dry side and flavour was what you'd expect anywhere else.  - Rice and Peas was actually Basmati and Peas. The traditional long grain parboiled rice was not used. I don't like basmati rice because it is very neutral, bland and too soft to give the dish a meaningful bite  My review is not set in stone because I will revisit to try the Schwarma."}
{"text":"Best Jamaican food in town.  DELICIOUS ackee and salt fish but it's only available on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"This place is always busy but it's so worth the wait. We generally try and call ahead of time to place our order but they can be so busy that they don't even pick up the phone! Jerk chicken and ox tail is always cooked right. We love the side rice, plantain, and vegetables.. Everything always on point. Good stuff, Chris!"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken meal ever! Comes with rice and peas, veggies and plantain. Highly addictive :)"}
{"text":"Got lunch from Chris's today. I had the Jerk Chicken Shawarma and Jerk Chicken Poutine. To die for! The poutine is huge, so two of us shared it. Even half the poutine and the shawarma is a big meal and a nap becomes mandatory afterward.   Just go and try it. You can thank me latter."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait time when I visited, but only because the place was packed. They smell of good island food brought me memories from Jamaica as a child in the kitchen on Sunday morning. You can see Chris enjoys cooking and pleasing his customers, it really showed in the brief visit I had as he engaged with customers.   The food is priced fairly, no crazy deals, but definitely no feeling of being ripped off.   The Jerk Chicken Dinner was so bless. The Jerk Chicken was moist and very well seasoned. The plantain and veggies were cooked just as well (which they threw in without me asking). I will 100% be a repeat customers and anyone looking for a little slice of Jamaica in Scarborough, this is a MUST TRY."}
{"text":"4.5/5 Im so happy to have come to this little carribean place.  thanks to yelp, my boyfriemd and i were feeling carribean and this was the one with best reviews that popped up.  id say pretty good reviews and now i know why. great portions this place definately doesnt skimp out.  you definately feel full and then some. the quality of the good was great and tasted homemade.  the jerk chicken was good as well as the curry chicken meal.  o cant stress enough about the portions and generous amounts of meat.  like woah- this place sure likes to feed you lol   all in all my bf and i are now sitting like bumps on a log.  so full and so satisfied and extremly nice staff."}
{"text":"Really good  Didn't bother trying the regular Jerk based on Yelp reviews but tried the jerk shawarma as others suggested and oh man was it good  Returned promptly the next day and I will be recommending to any of my friends not on a diet  Would have got a 5 star on the shawarma but the manish water (goat head soup) was horrendous, water down, drowned in carrots nastiness - never ever order   I ordered two and ended up throwing out the second it was that bad (manish is my 2nd favourite soup and third favourite food in the world so I'm very disappointed)  After talking about the soup I feel like bumping down to a three but the jerk shawarma is that good, I'm sure the jerk poutine is as well - try those and stay away from all others if a yardie or anyone else with a discerning Jamaican food pallate"}
{"text":"I've been going here for 4 years and they've never disappointed me.  I haven't successfully tried everything off their menu because every time i visit, I always get my favourites; the jerk and goat entrees.  The meals are well portioned, and decently priced.  Your tastebuds will thank you for going!"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken ever!!! The portion is generous and it's always my favourite go to place for Caribbean food in Scarborough. Excellent customer service, I am always a happy customer here."}
{"text":"As I wasn't too hungry, the two of us shared 1 jerk chicken ($8.95 before tax, included jerk chicken, beans, rice, veggies and fried plantains), and 1 jerk leg ($3 before tax). The jerk leg is individually priced at $3.50, but if you order like we did, you'd save $0.50 on the jerk leg.    The jerk sauce was nice, however the most delicious/flavourful bite was the first bite. Because the sauce was pretty spicy and almost had a \"stinging\" effect on your tongue, you couldn't really taste the flavour anymore after the first bite. All in all, it was worth the try!  Surprisingly the fried plantains were really nice, I would come back just for that!   Service was extremely slow though; we waited for about 20-25 minutes when there weren't that many people on a Friday late afternoon/early evening.  Not sure if we should feel safe or not safe in this plaza as we saw THREE police cars in the parking lot lol."}
{"text":"Chris Jerk is part of the trifecta of amazing food at Huntingwood Square (including Lindo's and the Pho place there).   I decided to come here after hearing my girlfriend saying some good things about it, and she is definitely not wrong. Chris Jerk has one of the best, if not the best, jerk chicken in Toronto. It's juicy, flavourful, and most importantly not dry. You can order the jerk chicken with rice, steamed vegetables and plantain or if you're feeling a little less healthy, you can opt all those out for a jerk chicken poutine. The jerk chicken poutine is pretty much a staple to all students in that neighbourhood, with Chris offering student/lunch specials. Another dish worth mentioning is the ox-tail. Its just a melt in your mouth experience.   Overall amazing place, really nice people and great food. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken shawarma poutine ($7.50?). Not traditional (shredded cheese, not curds), but ridiculously delicious. We shared it between three people. It comes in a rectangular takeout box. I appreciate that they line their styrofoam box with parchment paper (wax paper?). The poutine is a hot mess in the most beautiful of ways, and I would prefer not eating melted styrofoam box, so the parchment paper (wax paper) really makes a difference to me. I actually prefer shredded cheese to cheese curds (not a fan of the squeak of curds, but am a big fan of stringy, melted cheese), so this works for me. The gravy is thick and rich and flavorful, and the jerk chicken is delicious as well. The fries are crispy if you get to them before the gravy and cheese take over. Had we not planned on going to at least two more stops on Food Tour 2.0 (Scarborough Edition), I would have be sorely tempted to get another one.  Side note: Get there early. They have a limited quantity of jerk chicken shawarma available."}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews. Easy to find place looks clean and comfortable. I came around 6:30 and there was some things sold out for the day. I had the jerk breast and oxtail to share and they were both amazing. I totally recommend the breast. Usually people think the breast is dry but it is actually really good and perfectly cooked. Will be back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"They give you such great portions for the price. We ordered the jerk chicken dinner, about $9 and comes with plantain, veggies, rice and beans and 3 chicken pieces. Fantastic taste, and a great experience. 5/5 would go back here again!"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken and shawarma, a combination you wouldn't expect to be in the same building, but it works perfectly.    I came here under recommendation from a friend.  It was around 6pm when I first came here and they were out of shawarma.  If you ever watched that 4YallEnt. video on YouTube, \"JAMAICAN RESTAURANTS NEVER HAVE FOOD!\" you know how it goes down.  Anyways, came back here another day at an earlier time and got the jerk chicken shawarma and the poutine as well.  It was amazing.  Totally worth it and I loved every bite.  I heard the shawarama meal is also amazing so I guess that's what I'll be trying next time.  The people there are friendly, the food is delicious, and the cost isn't bad. 5/5 for making me cry tears of joy when I finally had that jerk chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"At the corner of a small strip plaza, the close quite early and only had 30 minutes to order and eat before the closed at 9pm (not 10pm as stated on the yelp page) its not decorated inside, really simple and no frills  Got the jerk chicken poutine - so yummy so fatty - covered in lots and lots of dark gravy and the chicken portion was large - and the jerk seasoning on the chicken really gave the poutine a good kick - I would definitely get this again and again  Also got the curry chicken meal - it came with a bit of stir fried cabbage, chick peas, rice with beans ( I usually dont like rice but it was really good!) and fried plantains. It was great - food was served hot. Also got 2 grace pineapple sodas. Everything together was $20  Felt really like a neighbourhood joint - it was mother's day weekend so the tenants beside came in to wish the women working a happy mothers day before closing. A lot of people came in and got take-out they have about 10 seating spaces inside."}
{"text":"Honestly when you see 4.5 rating, it's like screaming YOU GOTTA EAT HERE! But honestly you don't. It's just another jerk place. Their jerk chicken or poutine is nothing out of the world, if you're expecting that!   Don't get me wrong, you will not regret the money you spend on it, if you are in the area. But don't waste your time traveling a long way to get it, like me! I try places and try to make a memory for my taste buds, this has already faded from that."}
{"text":"A must try, you shall not be disappointed.  Good food, great people, you will leave happy!!!"}
{"text":"We had the traditional jerk chicken leg with rice and peas. The chicken was moist and nicely caramelized making it very tasty. Hot sauce tasted homemade and had a pleasant kick. Service was friendly and accommodating to minor order substitutions. Establishment clean. Portions are good for the price. Definitely worth a visit.  Update 2017:  Over the past few years I've had Fish Head Soup, Jerk Chicken wrap, Jerk Chicken Poutine, Fried Chicken, Oxtail Stew, Jerk Salmon, Red Snapper Ceviche. All have been excellent. Chris consistently prepares delicious meals."}
{"text":"Killer Caribbean place. huge portions and the price is great for the quantity. I'm gunna have to come back here at least once a week"}
{"text":"Always, always, always the best option for fresh Caribbean food in Scarborough. Really an east side gem.   I can't express how much I love this place. I always order the oxtail meal with a side of chickpeas, and it's never disappointed.   A little bit pricy but worth every penny. Portions are large and food couldn't be fresher.   Keep at it Chris."}
{"text":"This place is SOO good! I always get the jerk leg dinner which comes with fresh vegetables (broccoli, carrot), plaintain pieces and a bed of rice and peas. I love jamaican food and this place is awseome because they have a good jerk chicken shawarma which places a nice middle eastern twist on it. I have tried the jerk chicken shawarma wrap which IMHO is O.K. because the wrap is pretty basic - a whole wheat tortilla. My friends have had the jerk chicken shawrama POUTINE and they love it.. portions are big for the price you pay. However, as a tip if you are planning to go for the shawarma meat, make sure you go earlier in the day because by 2pm sometimes it's sold out... I have yet to try their weekend menu (oxtail, ackee and saltfish) but I look forward to it because the food is delicious here!"}
{"text":"Originally, I was going to get the curried goat but they were sold out. Instead, I asked the cashier to list me some popular orders and she recommended the oxtail entry.   It is delicious! I don't think it's possible to describe how amazing the quality of food is.   Their oxtail recipe has exceeded my expectations. I can even tell you how perfect the vegetables are. Blanching the vegetables makes the meal more enjoyable- it doesn't take your focus away from the oxtail meat. The rice and beans are nicely seasoned and cooked. The oxtail is the BEST oxtail I have ever had in my life and that's all I'm going to say- you will have to eat it yourself to understand where I'm coming from.   I'm definitely coming back here, and I am definitely different dishes."}
{"text":"First time trying jerk chicken and I think I've become a fan of it. Seeing how this place had really good reviews, I decided to try it out. It seems like a family run business but everyone is really friendly. I ordered the shawarma poutine and jerk chicken dinner (chicken, plantains, rice, steamed veggies). At first, I was confused with the jerk chicken poutine and the shawarma poutine said on other reviews, but it turned out to be the same thing. I was thinking  it would include the fillings like a shawarma wrap but nahhh. Either way, jerk chicken, gravy, cheese and fries??? SOO GOOD. So much chicken and cheese -drools-  I also loved the jerk chicken dinner since it was a little more sweet and spicy rather than just spicy like my poutine. I've never eaten plantain before and thought it was a little weird to eat it in a savory dish since it's sort of like banana but it was delicious!  Each dish was $9 including tax which is not too bad considering the huge portions. Guaranteed you will be STUFFED after your meal. I couldn't even finish mine completely!"}
{"text":"BEST jerk chicken in scarbrough! thats all you need to know"}
{"text":"On food alone...they would get a \"5\".  On number of seats available, wait time and the sometimes possibility of running out of particular dishes they drop to a \"4\".   The solution to this is of course, go early and get take out. I am not slagging on this place as it is unbelievably good. The owner grew up in an area of Kingston that knows how to cook. Yah, nyam it'all!"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken poutine in Scarborough!!! Very sweet and nice staff as well. I was getting the jerk chicken poutine for takeout but got tempted to try it before we leave... Let's just say there was not much poutine left by the time we left the store. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! I went after reading the reviews and was not disappointed. The jerk poutine was so good. I can't stop thinking about it. Also had the jerk shawarma plate. Very good. Honestly I could eat here every day. Great service and friendly too."}
{"text":"Sharwama pouting is outstanding. Served very hot and fresh. Jerk sauce is very flavourful.   Red snapper was dried, sitting in heating pan. Would not order again.   Same with their plantains  Stick with the classics: jerk chicken, jerk sauce items"}
{"text":"Honestly I've passed by this place many times without giving it a second thought, but I'm really glad I decided to finally try it out.  Jerk Shwarma Poutine: Perfect amount of cheese, gravy, fries, and spice. Really, really good. I am definitely a fan of this. The only thing was that it probably could have used a few more pieces of chicken because the pieces we got were super delicious but we finished all of them before we could finish the fries. Still really good though. Can't wait to go back!  My favourite jerk chicken place is still at York U, but next time I come here I'll try the meal instead of just the jerk chicken."}
{"text":"I love going here when I'm hungry, it really hits the spot! The portions are large and everything is flavourful. My favourite is the oxtail combo. Make sure you ask for their hot sauce, it's amazing."}
{"text":"BEST. JERK. IN. DA. CITY.   We were actually downtown last night and were talking about jerk chicken with some random Belly Buster employee and a crazy person drove by on his bicycle and told us how amazing Chris Jerk is. This was in the middle of SoHo in downtown Toronto, no where close to where this is located. Go figure ;)  I have had the shawarma here. Good size, amazing slaw and loaded with jerk chicken. CHECK.  I have had the poutine. Oh mama...this poutine is made by angels. I don't understand how they can fit that much cheese, that much gravy and that much chicken into that box. I explode every time I get it....granted I usually go for the poutine and the jerk quarter leg dinner *shy face* Oh and the fries are ridiculously yummy and crispy, somehow.   Now on to the guest of the show - jerk chicken. Watching that man chop the chicken quarters up into big juicy pieces, with sauce flying and bones crushing is by far one of the best experiences I have ever had. It's soooooo goooood guyssssss!!!!!!! Spicy, you can actually see the spices and the deliciousness under the skin if you lift it. Comes with plantains (sweet and yummy), vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, carrots) and rice. Everything is cooked to perfection. This makes me want to go to Jamaica...so bad. But I would like to take the nice chicken chopping man with me...so he can make me chicken in Jamaica :D   It's also very reasonably priced. I don't remember how much the shawarma was I think $6 bucks, the dinner is $9. They have student specials for $5!!  GO. JUST GO. GO GET JERK CHICKEN. YAASSSS"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after seeing reviews. It was Friday around noon.... horrible decision. We both ordered a shawarma meal and it took about 30minutes to get it. I was a bit bothered by the fact that there were some people who ordered after us got their orders first. At first I thought maybe those customers ordered something else which was quicker for the kitchen to replenish... but then I started paying close attention to the kitchen staff packing shawarma meals.. and customers who placed the order after us got their meals. I was thinking it was because me and my friend were sitting down and we don't look like we are in a rush? Well this is a bit unfair in my opinion.   Onto the food, portions are large and one meal is heavy. I could not finish the entire meal. It's good portions and the food is decent. In all honesty, i think the food is decent but nothing wowed me. Nothing exceptional to make me return. But for the price and portions, i think it's a great place to grab food if I'm in the area. But not particularly a restaurant or a take-out place where I would go out of the way for. That being said, this restaurant is located in a tiny plaza and it's not near any major landmarks. So I highly doubt there will be a chance for me to be super near this joint to return.   In conclusion, if you are nearby and you are looking for a place to grab take out (not sit in though because there's barely any seats) then I do suggest coming here."}
{"text":"I've had jerk chicken, and I've had shawarma, but I'm pretty sure I've never had jerk chicken made as shawarma. It was delicious, plain and simple. We only got one to share because we weren't too hungry, but I really wish that we each got our own portion. The chicken was superbly tender and flavored with all the jerk spices; the skin had just the right amount of char to be crispy. The side of plantains was also delicious, and the rice and vegetables rounded out the meal. The ambiance of the place is nothing to rave about, but the food here is definitely worth coming out for."}
{"text":"Got there at 6pm. overheard they ran out of fried chicken. And I got the last order of jerk chicken poutine. Really busy place. The ladies are really nice and friendly. The Jerk chicken poutine is a must try. We had the chicken poutine, chicken dinner with a extra leg, all for $23. Will be there again."}
{"text":"This place is so good!  I always get the ox tail (if it hasn't been sold out already).   Portions are generous and quality is top notch. Always always get an extra side of plantains!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!bbq jerk wings with rice and peas tasted great...gets busy so try and get there before 6pm..."}
{"text":"Poutine and wrap were awful but the Jerk chicken + bbq wings were really good."}
{"text":"Authentic west Indian food. Very friendly staff, food is great. There is usually a line up for food but that should tell you how good it is. There's spots to sit and eat but I wouldn't really consider this a sit down type of restaurant, it's small. I have tried the curried chicken entree and jerk chicken entree so far-both excellent!! I've never had such tenderly cooked chicken that is so full of flavour. I want to try the jerk chicken Shwarma but they are always out of it when i go. Prices are good, big serving portions. No complaints here, I always leave a happy customer with a full belly."}
{"text":"We came here to grab a quick lunch to go for the next day. Everyone was really friendly and they have a nice variety on the menu to choose from. We ended up getting the jerk chicken meal and it was really good! They pack so much in the box, you can pretty much have two meals.  Their rice was delicious and though I don't personally like the beans, the flavor was great! The jerk chicken was so good! Nice and spiced with the beautiful blackened color. It was moist and so flavorful!   I would recommend it if you're looking for a jerk chicken fix :) I would love to try the curry next"}
{"text":"Was in the area and looking for a place to eat so decided to come here after reading all the good reviews. The place itself is small - probably seats about 15 people however the food is good. Ordered the jerk chicken. Came in a bed of rice and some vegetables and plantian. The chicken was delicious ... probably the best I had so far. Will go beak and try some other things the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Great jerk, friendly owners. The jerk shawarma always sells out before I can make it there, so I'll try it one day."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of jerk places, this one really stands out.  Friendly staff, and this place is very clean.  Varied menu including meat and fish choices, along with soups.  The dinners are great value.  Lots of food, dinners can be split by 2 people really.  But it's so tasty, it's hard to share lol.  Dinners come with rice & peas, gravy, carrots, broccoli, fried plantain and chunks of green cabbage, which are all very tasty.  My favourite is the jerk boneless chicken shawarma dinner.  Perfectly cooked chicken, moist with crispy edges.  They are doing a way better job than most shawarma places when it comes to grilling the meat.  Anyway, I keep coming back to this place.  Great food, great value, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I got the jerk chicken shawarma dinner. The price was about 12 dollars and you get a heaping pile of jerk shawarma, steamed veggies, fried plantains, rice and peas as well as the gravy on top. The taste of the food was phenomenal. Everything was very fresh and you can tell these people take pride in the taste of the food they serve. I wish I had been offered the hot sauce when I came in, but next time I will definitely ask for the hot sauce on the side because it looked pretty good. I will definitely be coming back many times and will take my friends here!"}
{"text":"Had the Jerk Chicken wrap - with the works. It was delicious! definitely recommend this spot. Not a ton of space inside so best to go when it's not busy."}
{"text":"(3.5/5) After seeing the high ratings for this place I decided to try it with my friend on a Saturday evening. I haven't had west Indian type food in a while so I was looking forward to try it. Overall the food was good and had a nice mix of seasoning on the meats. The portion sizes were relatively large so come hungry.   The context: The restaurant is small and can seat about 12 people, but seems more like a takeout place. The food is served in styrofoam containers with plastic cutlery.  It was very busy when we arrived and stayed that way after we had finished eating. The cashier told me they are always busy so have a little patience while they prep your order. We were in queue and got our food within 10 minutes.  There were about 6 employees working in the tight space behind the counter/ food warmer. It was nice being able to see the cooks preparing your meal (kind of boosts your confidence that the food will be good).   The food: Poutine with jerk chicken - crispy fries, smooth gravy and cheese topped off with a full leg jerk chicken. What is there not to like?  Jerk pork with rice and peas (beans) - the best thing about this was how tender the pork was (melt-in-your-mouth level of tenderness). The soft fatty pieces complimented nicely to the lean pieces. The rice and peas were a nice filler and the plantains had a nice sweetness.   Ox tail with rice and peas - I love ox tail but unfortunately it was on the dry side which was disappointing (seasoning was good). Everything else was cooked fine (rice, plantain, vegetables)  Summary: A good choice for takeout if you are craving west indian food. The ox tail can be a hit or miss in terms of dryness."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and all around awesome people working there. They're always friendly and wanting to help.   Be sure if you want to get the chicken shawarma to go EARLY!! They sell out of this stuff quick! I've gone to Chris Jerk a bunch of times and every time they've sold out :(  The chicken curry, oxtail, and chicken wing entrees are delicious and worth the money! You probably could get away with sharing an entree due to the size or you can devour the whole thing like me and have itis for the rest of the day haha  Note: there's going to be long lines during lunch and dinner time due to popularity   Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Located in the plaza on the southwest corner of Birchmount and Huntingwood, it was not hard to find. Came here for lunch today, and it was PACKED. A good sign for me.  The jerk chicken shawarma was recommended to me by my friend who has eaten here before, so that is what I got. For $12.95 I got a jerk chicken shawarma dinner and a Grace's pineapple pop.  I was starving upon coming in, and I couldn't even finish half of my meal. Everything was delicious, the fried plantain was really tasty!  I'll definitely come back to try some of their other items. The fried chicken looked really crispy and nice too, so I'll give that a shot next time."}
{"text":"Chris jerk serves Jamaican food. Its located in a little plaza at Birchmount and Huntingwood.  I came here for their jerk chicken. The jerk chicken is really really good. The entrée includes rice and peas, veggie and plantain. I have also tried their ox tail. It has a sweet taste to it, it's really good. Came back to try the curry goat. The flavour nice but I prefer the ox tail and jerk chicken. From the other reviews it seems the shawarma and poutine are good too. Will try that next time.  I visit whenever i am craving Jamaican. I'm glad I found this place, really a gem in Scarborough."}
{"text":"If there's one thing that you can be guaranteed of at Chris Jerk, it's good food! It's always very tasty and the portions are generous. Chef Chris Taylor is passionate about his cooking and very engaging with his guests.  The menu includes the usual Jamaican favourites: jerk chicken, curry goat, curry chicken, oxtail, and more! There are several seafood offerings on Fridays and Saturdays, all delicious.   The house specialty is the Jerk Chicken Shawarma, an original dish by Chris Jerk. Make sure you come early to sample this because they usually sell out by early evening!"}
{"text":"Saw this place when we went to Mexico Lindo recently and made a note to check it out. We ordered the quarter jerk chicken leg w/ rice & peas and veg, jerk chicken wings w/ rice & peas and slaw, and rum cake.  The seasoning on the quarter chicken is spicy, but not overly so, nothing most people can't handle. Most of the spice is on the skin so you can remove that and dig into the meat to get the flavor of the jerk w/o being assaulted by the pepper on the skin. Better yet, get a bite of skin and meat to get the right mix of spice. Gravy on the rice & peas livened them up, and the included veg was cooked to the right texture.  The wings are spicy, but less hot and are actually sweeter, so they're a better choice for people less used to spicy food. As for the rum cake, it's moist, flavorful, and full of rum, as you would expect.  They also have jerk shawarma poutine which looks and sounds good so we'll have to come back to try it out.  The interior's nicer than most fast food places and service is friendly. Reggae was playing softly in the background when we were there."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite jerk place. Best flavors and portions are amazingly huge (trump voice) lol. I truly love it here as a chef i can appreciate the love in the food and they treat you like family. Chef jerk keep doing what you doing and ill keep coming."}
{"text":"I frequent this Huntingwood / Birchmount plaza often. I had never visited this place because there were so many solid options in this plaza for a tasty, reasonably priced meal - and there's so much variety.  But I finally decided to try this place out.   They had me at JERK CHICKEN SHAWARMA WRAP.   \"Wait, what?!\" You ask? Ya. Jerk.Chicken.Shawarma.Wrap.   Why would you ever eat a regular shawarma wrap when you can have a delicious jerk seasoned chicken shawarma wrap? It brings the chicken shawarma to another level.   The chicken is well seasoned, moist and so delicious and not swimming in oil! You get a choice of brown or white burrito tortilla wrap - it's layered with your choice of fresh toppings which include shredded iceberg, white onions, sweet pickles, tomatoes, and oil and vinegar slaw. Then they pile on the delicious jerk chicken meat- and there was a choice of sauce - I got a sweet mayo of some sort and a garlicy mayo. They didn't oversauce - there was no sauce at the bottom of the wrapper, and it didn't over power the other components of the wrap. They rolled, and bundled and then a couple of minutes in the press... BOOM!   The chicken is tasty, the jerk seasoning has a good bite, and the heat builds as I made my way through the wrap - but it doesn't ever burn burn. The veggies help balance the spice level. The least to say - I recommend the wrap! It was about $6 for the wrap.  Then I saw the soup options, and crayfish grouperhead got my attention. I didn't know what I was expecting - but it's a broth soup - mine had a whole shrimp in it - head, shell and all (That's how I like it!) a couple of pieces of cassava, and not much other veggies in there...would have liked a bit more veg, but still very good. There was good heat to it - and really well seasoned soup. It wasn't very fishy - the shrimp was the strongest base flavour for sure. I would get the soup again if I was in the mood for a nice homey soup! The soup was just under $4  Staff were friendly, quick and efficient.   They have take-out options and sit in option. It's a nice clean, casual, unique dining option in the area!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had gluten free vegetarian jerk meal with extra plantains... and my companions had jerk pork, oxtail, and chicken... plus curry goat. All served on top of rice and beans. Everything was extremely smooth and tasty !!! There are only few tables, as this is mostly take-away bistro... and more popular dishes sell out by 5pm. Very popular eatery !!!"}
{"text":"I had the curry chicken meal.  It came with a generous serving of yummy basmati rice , vegetable, fried plaintains and curry chickpeas. My brother had the jerk chicken dinner.  We also got a jerk chicken poutine . The jerk chicken was well seasoned and had the right amount of spices.  The curry was delicious could have used a little more spice but I added pepper sauce to mine.  The staff is so friendly and accommodating.  The owner asked if we needed anything and wiped the table down for us himself.  Place is clean and well staffed.  We did not have to wait .Definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"Oh, man. The food here is awesome. If you like food from the caribbean, then this is the place for you. Fair prices, generous portions. It really fills you up. The food is really well done. It all tastes fresh. The place is small, so take away is your best option. Grab and go."}
{"text":"Gf and I got the jerk leg meal and jerk shwarma poutine. Looks like death but tastes great (the poutine).  Highly recommend this place to those nearby.  The wait time is short, we tried calling ahead but no luck."}
{"text":"I have had it before and I didn't like it. But luckily I decided to come here again because they are the only place with Jerk Chicken BREAST. funny enough though they were sold out so I had to get something else. It tasted 1000x better this time. I got the jerk wings combo and a jerk leg poutine. I have to give this place a 4star because they were sold out of breast and also because I did not know the jerk wings would be basically bbq Flavoured. I was expecting straight up dry jerk wings. Also, I do not prefer basmati rice for my rice&peas. My favourite thing about this place was the fact that my food was PIPING HOT. Omg, heaving. It was steaming forever. The quality of fries used in a poutine beats any place that sells poutine. The jerk leg was fall off the boneeeeeeee. I had to catch my breath for second. The girl at cash was really nice as well and very honest about wait times for food and stuff. That's a plus. I will be returning though!"}
{"text":"After getting a haircut at the Gondola hair salon next door, I came by to pick up something for dinner.  At first, I was a little confused as I saw a big spit of meat rotating behind a counter but apparently their jerk chicken shawarma is a popular item which explained otherwise an odd sighting of a rotating sharwarma thingy in a Caribbean joint.    I ordered oxtail stew, curry goat and a jerk chicken leg to go.  The gentleman assembling my order took the time to lay a piece of parchment paper down on the takeout Styrofoam containers for both oxtail and the curry goat which held the gravy soaked rice, meat and veggies beautifully without any mess until I got home.  Added points for attention to detail.  The jerk chicken leg was tender and superbly seasoned.  I liked that their jerk sauce packed a nice punch unlike other places where I've had just really dry jerk chicken with barely any sauce.    The oxtail was my favorite as fall off the bone pieces of oxtail sat bathing in a rich gravy that was also generously covering the accompanying rice and beans.  I'll note that their rice and beans were one of the more pleasant versions I've every had and possibly because the rice tasted a lot of butter.  Butter?! you say?  I know.  It's strange but that's what I tasted in the rice which in my opinion was not a bad thing.  Just unusual.    Curry goat was also well spiced and the seasoning of the gravy was just perfect for me.  A little too spicy for my husband who doesn't enjoy spicy food as much as I do.  Both entrees came with some fried plantain and steamed veggies.  As far as the flavour and the value goes, I'll be returning to try out their other dishes next time I'm in the plaza for a haircut."}
{"text":"The Jerk chicken here is ridiculously good!!! In fact , if on your first visit you didn't enjoy it , contact me and I'll pay for your order !!!!  The food here is made with love and care and prepared by real Jamaicans.     I highly recommend you start with the jerk chicken and be sure to try the homemade hot sauce. It will blow ur mind."}
{"text":"This place is practically named after me so I had to give it a try. I had originally wanted to go to Mexico Lindo right next door but they were too busy so I stopped over at this place instead. Best decision ever!  Jerk chicken with rice and peas with a side of steamed veggies and a sweet caramelized plantain. Huge chicken leg portions and when compared with the meat to rice ratio its about 50:50 No joking around. The meat had a nice strong jerk spice to it and was super moist and tender. The plantain was amazing and acts just like a healthy dessert as oppose to those sweet sugary desserts.   Service was quick and friendly. $8.95 for a really filling meal.  Solid 4.5 outta 5"}
{"text":"Love their jerk chicken poutine! I always call in before going in to pick up. Much faster than waiting in line for 30 mins."}
{"text":"Very good portion for the price. Very authentic taste. I especially liked their ginger beer."}
{"text":"I've had some of the most unique, authentic, and tasty jerk chicken around the world. Sadly, I ate here today.   Coming off a friend's recommendation, I thought I'd give this jerk restaurant a try.   Simply put, I thought I'd overlook the facety, unprofessional, rude cashier/person taking my order and hoped that the jerk chicken dinner with rice and plantain would sweeten my experience--boy was I wrong.  The chicken is dry and unflavoured. I don't taste even one ounce of jerk sauce. I basically received the Metro grocery daily chicken special.  Thanks, but not thanks. Chris, find another dish to cook.  :)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and cheap. Didn't taste oily like most places and liked how the meal already included vegetables and plantains for no extra charge. Servers were professional (even though we had to wait a bit for the rice, Chris stepped up and started serving the back up as fast as he could). I live in the west end of Toronto but I would come back again for this place and try their jerk shwaramas! (Which they ran out of tonight)"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars for Chris Jerk!  I've been here twice for lunch, ordering the jerk chicken shawarma plate, jerk chicken shawarma sandwich and jerk chicken poutine. All were very good and very filling as the portions were huge.  I had never thought of mixing jerk chicken and shawarma together, but it works! The poutine was OKAY..typical gravy with fries (which I am sure was frozen and then deep fried), with a slab of jerk chicken shawarma on top.  The jerk chicken shawarma sandwich was probably the best thing on the menu. Just imagine a Caribbean-style pita wrap.  My friend had ordered the ackee and fish dish, and that was tasty too, if you don't mind the texture of ackee. Not many places serve ackee, so this is a good place to try it.  The atmosphere is like any other small fast food take-out restaurant. It has several seats and tables by the window, so most people get their food to go. The staff is friendly and they will recommend dishes for you if you're not very familiar with Caribbean food.  This is very close to my workplace, so I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"My family and I always drive out of the way to come here. I've had the goat and it's amazing, but I usually come for the jerk shawarma poutine. I'll drive 20 mins out of the way to fill that craving and it's definitely worth it. Its usually busy when I come in but I never have to wait too long and I've never been unfortunate enough to see the shawarma run out. The portions are HUGE and could easily be shared. I like that unlike most places you get plantain and veg in your meal."}
{"text":"Amazing!! It was my first time here! Came with my boyfriend at 12pm on a Thursday and there were already 10 ppl waiting for take-out!!  Food 5/5  The shawarma poutine is so good. Must eat item. I like that it is a bit spicy. Not salty. The Curry Goat Meal is very good. Love it. The meat is so tender and flavorful!  The Jerk Chicken Meal is the signature dish there. My boyfriend likes it. The meal comes with veggies, rice, and plantain! All are very good and go so well with the main. Portion is generous! Price is decent!  Service 5/5 There is no table service in this restaurant. Most people buy take-out and there are approx 15 dine-in seats. The staffs there are very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu and what is included in the meal.   Love this place. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Must go here!!! Food is amazing and staff very friendly :)  I still need to try the Jerk Chicken Shawarma....by the time I get there after work it is always sold out.....im sure it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I ordered the jerk chicken dinner I wanted to try the poutine but it was sold out I could tell the food was good just by seeing the lineup small place not many tables but the food is delicious and with that hotsauce it is amazing order the jerk chciken dinner the main signature dish is the jerk chicken don't order anything else except that next time I will try their jerk chciken poutine"}
{"text":"This place is located in this kind of sketchy strip mall but surprisingly it looks better from its exterior....a couple of seatings, it's a fast food take out/sit in....got pretty busy during the lunch hour on a weekday  Good prices, big portions and delicious Got the jerk chicken dinner, not as soft and fall off the bone as other places but still good and spicy  The jerk shawarma poutine was awesome Altho when it gets cold, the fries are a bit too hard so eat it quick!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried this place at the recommendation of my friend. I wasn't disappointed!! The jerk chicken I had was tender and well seasoned. There was lots of rice and peas. Next time I'll ask for a bit more veggies. My buddy had oxtail and he said he like that lots."}
{"text":"After reading up the Yelp reviews, my bf and I just had to check this place out.    Located in a quaint little strip plaza in Scarbs, with quite a few other options of cuisine to eat, this is definitely the hot spot to hit.  Its a revolving door of diverse customers with an order up counter and limited seating.  We arrived there around prime dinner time, so the place was busy and their jerk chicken shawarma was sadly sold out :(  Nevertheless, we placed our order of a curry goat entree and a jerk chicken entree.  A veteran to Caribbean style cooking, my bf was skeptical how authentic the food would taste, but he (and I) were both pleasantly surprised.  Cooked in a Jamaican style, both entrees came with rice and peas, fried plantains and a melody of vegetables (broccoili, cabbage and carrots).  Now lets break it down...flavourful, but not as spicy as I was expecting (make use of their hot sauce), portion size was good, both meats were cooked well -- especially the jerk chicken which was moist (and not dried out like most places), basmati rice and peas and plantains were tasty and complimented the dish well and veggies were pretty standard.  I particularly would prefer better veggies, maybe some okra or peppers.  Overall, I would recommend you swing by when you're craving a taste from the islands."}
{"text":"Good home cookin!  Great food, friendly people.    I had the curry goat w/ rice and peas.  If you want a great meal eat here.   5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is always busy (and for a good reason!).  The portions are huge and the food is delicious.. what more could you ask for?!  My usual is the jerk chicken (comes with some veggies, rice&beans, jerk chicken, plantains) or the bbq chicken tenders (comes with coleslaw, rice & beans, plantains).  PS. Order ahead if you know what you want to avoid wait times! PPS. They are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Decent food I tried the ox tail dinner wasn't impressed to many little bones tried the jerk chicken dinner that was half decent my last attempt was the jerk chicken wrap they old lady who dressed my wrap was very stingy for the price of 9$ I would expect better 3/5 stars cause the food is decent just not for the price"}
{"text":"\"Yah man, de food so good he're man!\"....yep that's me and my crappy attempt at speaking Patois;) But do you know what's not crappy?   \"De food at Chris Jerk's man!\"  Located at the corner of the food centric plaza in Scarborough, Chris Jerk's serves some great Caribbean food from jerk chicken, rice and peas, curries, fried plantains, and of course their famous poutines!  Food is delicious and portions are big so make sure you bring your appetite!  There is some seating but its more of a take out joint as the space is small.  We have also done party trays recently and the food was ready at the time promised so good option for those who want to cater a Caribbean inspired party.  So what's my verdict?  \"Fore outta five man!!\"  Okay, okay, no more bad jokes I promise!"}
{"text":"This place is right at Birchmount and Huntingwood.  Got the Ox Tail Rice and Peas take-out - which is my standard order.  About $15 - you get a very generous dinner portion. Comes with veggies and a plantain (fried banana - was heavenly good!!).  Ox Tail was delicious, meat fell off the bone nicely and had good flavour. Ox Tail gravy was good, not too salty. Rice was fresh and perfectly moist, could have had more beams tho..   Overall very satisfied with their Ox Tail Rice and Peas.  Awesome food, fairly priced for their setup!  Would definitely come back to try their Jerk Chicken!!"}
{"text":"The food is so good. They make it fresh when you order. We ordered the jerk and curried chicken meals. The meals are huge portions, come with rice and beans, steamed veggies, fried plantains and protein. The food is of course 5/5 and their service and general attitude is also 5/5. If this is your first time there they help you with the ordering process, super kind and the whole atmosphere gives off a friendly family feel between workers and customers."}
{"text":"This is a small place in a strip mall. We had the  1. curry shrimp which was flavorful but not too spicy.  The shrimp came with rice which was not just a side it had its own flavor and I happily finished it.  It also came with greens that even my 10 year old nephew enjoyed. 2, the jerk wings with fries and coleslaw.  Wings were well cooked and fries were crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside (just right for me) 3 jerk chicken.  Again the flavour was there and they were yummy.   We will return"}
{"text":"I had the jerk shawarma poutine and it's safe to say that this is THE MOST amazing poutine I have ever had in my life...  The cashier was a gorgeous girl who patiently helped us decide on what to order. The jerk shawarma poutine is their top seller so we order it.  The wait time for the food was around 8-10 minutes. The place is tiny, but people usually take it to go. You can see the chefs preparing the food.  The poutine came with lots of jerk shawarma and cheese. The sauce wasn't too much and just enough. It was not too salty like most poutine places. Loved how the fries were still crispy but saucy!!!  Going to be back soon! :)"}
{"text":"Only discovered this place last year and I'm sad I didn't find out about it sooner! Located on a corner of a small strip plaza, you can tell the place is popular with the amount of people coming in and out of the restaurant around 7pm for take out and dinner.   Been here twice on separate occasions now, having the curry goat first then the stewed ox tail the second time and both dishes have been nothing short of amazing and full of flavour. Both dishes had loads of sauce, a healthy serving of rice and veggies, and a few pieces of fried plantains. Also tried some jerk chicken poutine and my goodness it's everything you think it could be and more! So much gravy, meaty chicken portions... and the fries are cooked to order too so you know your meal is freshly made.   The staff are all very lively and chat with lots of the regulars when they can catch a breath or get some space as the restaurant is a smidge on the tiny side inside.   No table service here especially with the smaller tables, but if you're lucky to find a seat in the restaurant, it's a nice cozy neighbourhood joint to sit down and eat with others. I wouldn't recommend a party bigger than 4 people sitting down together though."}
{"text":"I love this place. Just avoid lunch time during the school year as it will be very busy. Very delicious. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the shawarma poutine and jerk chicken dinner. Both were amazing. The poutine has the perfect amount of gravy and a lot of melted cheese (no fry went untouched by cheese and gravy). The gravy was very flavourful (they used the jerk sauce as gravy) but just slightly on the saltier side. The jerk chicken was the best I've had in Toronto. Very moist unlike most other caribbean restaurants in Toronto. The rice and beans that came along with the jerk chicken wasn't too oily and very flavourful. Portions were large. Both dishes came out to $20 and change.   Went on a Friday night and it was busy, wait time wasn't too long(15 mins for takeout) but the girl taking orders did say they were running out of shawarma. It was only 6pm so that was kind of disappointing. She did make accommodations and still sold me the shawarma poutine but it was obvious they skimped out on the meat (since they were running out). Considering how busy they are this is understandable but would have given 5 stars if they had enough stock of one of their bestselling dishes.   Great food and good service!"}
{"text":"Pros: - Food taste great. Can eat the rice and peas with gravy all day - Large portions - Food taste fresh - Hot sauce is killer - Friendly staff  Cons: - Wait times could be better  Ordered: Jerk Chicken - Bomb.  Jerk BBQ Wings - Bomb. Fries are similar to Costco fries which speaks for itself Jerk Shawarma Poutine -  Bomb.  Conclusion: I come here regularly every week. The food taste great and the portions are huge. I've had Caribbean food, specifically jerk chicken, at other places but this is hands down the best that I've had. Their rice and peas with gravy are also the best I've had. Nothing more to say other than definitely try this place out. I'd recommend the jerk chicken with rice and peas, the jerk poutine, or the jerk bbq wings; all are killer."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and tastes home cooked.  Their menu is traditional and a few new twists.  In addition to the great soul food, their hot sauce won me over and I bought 2 bottles home (which I finished in a week).  Go early because their food actually sells out!"}
{"text":"Came here after work with a coworker because she raved about this place. Friendly and fast service. The food was delicious and looked fresh.   Side of Jerk Chicken - delicious! Oxtail Meal - extremely large portion, really filling.   I had a little mishap (something they couldnt control) and they handled it with class. I appreciate the customer service at this establishment."}
{"text":"Looking for real jerk? This is the place to go. Their combo comes with rice with peas , coleslaw or vegetable and plantain chips. Everything in the box is super yummy.  I personally don't find it spicy enough even with the hot sauce but the flavour is good.  I also find the curry goat better than the jerk chicken.  Definitely going back to try other stuff on their menu. :)"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken outside of the Caribbean islands. Chris does a great job flavouring the dishes. Be ready to wait during busy times but worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Expect lineups during lunch and dinner. I personally usually call to avoid the waiting but still some waiting time is required. I have ordered the fried chicken, jerk chicken and i have to say the jerk chicken is way better. Its tender, and juice. Also don't forget to ask for that spicy sauce that they have. Its da bomb!!"}
{"text":"Came here to jump on the jerk chicken poutine wagon and it not only satisfied my taste buds, I was having a brain reflux from over-gasming on cheese. If you love cheese, order this bad boy which has the good stuff melted all over the fries with chicken pieces.   Full meal right here but we wanted to dig in their meals, so we tried their jerk chicken meal that comes with rice and veggies.  The jerk chicken sauce is different from the other places I've visited, here it's not as heavily 'jerked' with spices so someone new to the 'jerk' experience might find this a great introduction to the Caribbean taste.   I enjoyed the fried plantain very much as the sweetness complimented the entire meal, balancing it out with some greens. Great portions with such a warm and vibrant group of staff.  The chef has had a blessed opportunity to open up a joint close to his passion and it really shows through his craftsmanship. His culinary experience as mentioned on the back of their menu boasts reasons of why this place will fill many hungry bellies for a very long time."}
{"text":"Oh man if your craving something delicious do yourself a favor and head over!!  I had the jerk chicken plate and my boyfriend had the same except he tried the pork. Both were fall off the bone deliciousness, how they make their meats so moist I'll never know! The rice were so so, I wish they seasoned them a bit more but the plantains are amazing - you'd never know they were fried!  My only complaint....make more of the jerk chicken shwarma, my boyfriend, myself and about 5 others were left dissappiinted when we were told it was out :(  YES it's that good it warrants a sad face!"}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise!  Got the sweet potato poutine, 2 jerk chicken legs and a jerk schwarma.   I usually don't even like poutine but this one was really good with the cheese super melted and the flavor perfect.   Everything tastes great and the staff members were super friendly!! Would come again. Glad I found another cool spot with great food."}
{"text":"We got a little tired of Asian food all the time, so we stopped by this Caribbean joint for lunch - and it was amazing!! The restaurant is very small - there are just a few tables, and it's more designed for take-out. They have a nice range of options on the menu, including jerk chicken/pork, shawarma, fried chicken, fish, and more. Once you place your order at the counter, it takes about 10 minutes for them to prepare it. You can enjoy watching them cook while you wait.  The food itself was delicious. I had the jerk chicken shawarma and the chicken wings, which were both super tasty. The shawarma meal also came with rice and peas, steamed vegetables, and wonderful fried plantains. My friend got the fried chicken, which he said was the best he's ever had.  With so many good-looking options on their menu, we're sure to come back!"}
{"text":"My favourite Jamaican spot hands down!!  If you want fish. You gotta go Fridays and Saturdays. My standard issue meal is the jerk chicken meal. Not a big spot for sit down joints. But good eats. Actually always good eats in this plaza"}
{"text":"Post work meal (cause working all day is hard and deserves a meal!) It was enjoyable but I wouldn't say it was better than other Caribbean restaurants.  I would also recommend if you are looking to order off the jerk shawarma section to do it early. As I was informed they sell out usually after later in the evening... And much to my disappointment and the 10 other people after me, they didn't have any left when I arrived (got there 7:30 Monday).   The place is small and I can see why on other reviews it was mentioned getting a seat may be hard (4 tables) so this is probably better for take out as sitting there was kinda cold. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoy this spicier taste and I will be going back to try the jerk shawarma poutine! -"}
{"text":"Only had a few dishes here but they were delicious! The jerk chicken poutine is definitely a favourite since the portion is HUGE and they give you lots of meat. The service is fast and the staff are friendly! The only downside is that they tend to sell out fast - would recommend coming before the lunch/dinner rush!"}
{"text":"If you like jerk chicken -- might as well go for the poutine! $7.45 -- my friend swears by it. Myself? Not so much as I typically like original poutines... Not one to go cray on new and different poutines."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant at first on the thought of Jerk Chicken shwarma - but figured my love for jamaican food would give some leeway to any faults it may have.  BAM - juicy, well-seasoned, and a flavour that doesn't get dull. I also got the grouper head soup which was rich in flavour and had delicious dumplings.  To top it off, I indulged in a slice of rum cake which had a robust flavour. Overall, very pleasently surprised with the quality of food - will certainly make this a go-to spot when I've got authetic jerk in mind!"}
{"text":"Good God the food is delicious. I almost didn't come here but my Dad (who is a non-yelper and has not seen reviews) said the food here was top notch and he was so right.   Warning: The restaurant is configured take-out style but there still is some seating. This means that during peak lunch hours, the place is very busy due to the sheer volume of people visiting.   Coming from a Jamaican family, we have tried all the foods you can think of. However, to give myself an idea of how good it was, I ordered a simple jerk chicken with rice. After a few minutes our food was ready. I was expecting to open the box and see rice and chicken but the first thing that I noticed was the parchment paper. I assume this is used incase you puncture the bottom of the styrofoam, this way the gravy doesnt leak out. Also included were some steamed veggies and fried plantain. Its a lot of food for around $8.95.   The chicken is plentiful (2 drumsticks and a thigh) and tender like you wouldnt believe. The sauce is very mildly spicy and is so well put together. I didnt find it over salted and a couple hours later I am not in desperate need of water. Thats a good sign i think...  They serve the meal with basmati rice. Its a different texture compared to the usual parboiled rice. The grains are very thin in comparison and so it allows the sauce to seep in and touch every grain. I was not expecting this, but I absolutely welcome it.   Great job, Chris and team. I have yet to come back to try your other items."}
{"text":"First time here I came with my boyfriend and my two nieces. I'm a vegetarian, my bf doesn't eat pork and we all know ow picky kids could be lol The kids got the jerk chicken poutine and loved it. So much cheese, just enough gravy and the fries were still crispy, which they loved because most places load on the gravy and by the time you get to the middle its all soggy. I ordered the ackee and saltfish w food. It was so fresh and just delicious. The portion size was much more than expected. You can actually taste and see big chunks of saltfish . When ever I go to other west indian places they are so stingy on the saltfish half the time you cant taste any its like they only put saltfish juice . It came with fried plantain which was a bonus also got fried and boil dumplin which wasnt a special request also so delish!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the curry chicken, and fried chicken meals. The fried chicken was good. But the curry chicken was broken little pieces of scrap, dry, and lacked curry flavour."}
{"text":"I went here to meet up with some friends for lunch. I can't eat spicy food so the lady recommended I have the barbecue wings. They were the best wings I had ever had! The chicken was so tender and there was just the right amount of BBQ sauce and oh my gosh, it was the best barbecue sauce I had ever had. Don't even get me started with the fries. Amazing!!! So was the coleslaw. Very tiny place and service is a little slow but that's because it's all homemade! They also have a lot of cool exotic drinks to choose from. Price is a little on the reasonable side"}
{"text":"Couple of my Msgrs. Took me this place never been here. Order the jerk pork dinner wash very Tasty not to spicy just right. Would recommend this place to anybody or in the neighbor hood drop you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Jerk Chicken in town!  I have been here 3 times so far and all were 10/10 for food and service. Cant wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Tuesday. We ordered Shawarma poutine and oxtail meal. Everything was made to order. Our meal was ready in less than 10 minutes. Decided to dine in and enjoy our meal. The poutine had a good amount of meat to fries ratio. It was a sizeable portion and a great meal to share. The oxtail was seasoned well and very tender. It came with plantains, steamed veggies, and rice and peas. It is mildly spicy but very delicious. This is going to be our new Jamaican spot. I think the bonus part is they have great customer service and will answer all your questions. Can't wait to try all the other meals."}
{"text":"I hate to say it but the Jerk Chicken here is not that good. Edible, somewhat tasty, but not good. This is no chicken cooked in spices until the chicken fell off the bone. The chicken was actually a bit dry and stuck on the bone with only seasoning on the outside. The rice and beans was okay. It was nice that they added two slices of plantain on the side that was relatively tasty. For $8+ tax, the price is reasonable but not great.  Nice, clean, and new with good service and ample seating for a small counter-serving restaurant. I dont hate it, but I don't love it."}
{"text":"Just tried this place tonight , got the jerk chicken meal and gravy all over the rice and peas and wow so good and great size portions very friendly staff , carrot cake is a must have too . Definitely will be coming bk :)"}
{"text":"Jamaican food like you were in Kingston. No worries Mon, try the curry goat and oxtail"}
{"text":"This place has the best jerk chicken and oxtail I've ever had! My favorite part of a combo is the plantains - just a great combo to the chicken or the oxtail. I've also had the jerk chicken poutine - it takes a whole lot of effort NOT to order this yummy combo! Great little takeout place in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Chris Jerk Caribbean Bistro is an excellent pit stop for Jamaican/West Indian eats in the east end of town, if for no other reason than the fact that their fusion menu consists of jerk chicken shawarma. Using basmati rice as the basis for their rice and peas dishes is just one of many examples of the bold moves they've made as a business.  There isn't much room here for dining, but it's sufficient enough for those who can't wait to chow down on one of their many meat, fish or veggie dishes. Flavour and preparation are at the helm of the way they do things here. The jerk chicken is hard to rival. I've eaten here a handful of times and have yet to be dissatisfied. If you don't believe me, just try the jerk chicken shawarma or shawarma poutine.  It's a busy but lively atmosphere here, and every few minutes you see customers dropping in who seem to know exactly what they came for. This is definitely among the top 10 spots in the city for island flavour."}
{"text":"We were visiting some friends and they told us about this place ... very welcoming friendly ... small not a huge place ... we had the jerk chicken and some sides ... very good food ... enjoy"}
{"text":"D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.  They by far have the best jerk chicken in the entire GTA. Been here twice now, and will be visiting again. Friendly staff, great food, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The jerk comes with rice & peas, plantains and steamed vegetables with gravy. Even the veggies are really good quality, not limp or tasteless. Jerk is spiced up really well and not overly salty. Also the jerk poutine is phenomenal!!! The way poutine should be :-). I really look forward to going here again. Btw this place is more of a pick up place and usually there is a line up, but there are seats available."}
{"text":"I will give 4.5 star.  Place is clean, service is great and food is awesome!!!  We had the signature shawarma meal (shredded jerk chicken) and curry goat.  Both was great and nice presentation too!!!  We can't finish the food and take 1/2 of the meal home."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went by for a takeout dinner. I really appreciated how clean the place was it really looked like they took care of the restaurant. The staff was also very nice. When we got home both of us commented how juicy the meat was. I had the jerk chicken dinner and he had the jerk pork and for both us the food was very tasty. My husband really enjoyed the gravy.  I loved the fried plantains that comes with the meal. The rice was also really nice it was not all dried out and had a nice flavour. The amount of food you receive is not as much as some of the other jerk places but it is more than enough to fill you. Overall we both commented how fresh the food tasted and that we would be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is always fresh and tasty!  Portions are huge and the price is fair.  You know a place is good when their star items are always sold out by mid-day, keeps you coming back.  I'm a really big fan of the jerk meal, next time I'm going to try the goat a f the jerk poutine."}
{"text":"Bistro quality Caribbean cuisine.  Good food prepared hot and fresh! Not salty, greasy, and a meatless option is offered. Plantain is fried however not saturated with oil which is my favourite!  I highly recommend the jerk chicken!  Great prices, excellent presentation for a bistro specializing in Caribbean cuisine.   Good work Chris!...I'm a regular diner from now on."}
{"text":"Maybe I should have ordered something different. But my Jerk Chicken Shawrama Wrap ($5.95) was dry and tasted bland. I was hoping they have gravy to spice it up but all they have is hot sauce. Jerk spice was not presented at all.  I might give Chris Jerk another try. Maybe order something more traditional. Hopefully Quarter Leg should be ok, not too easy to make dark meat dry. or even ackee and fish which is only available on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"This place was creeping at a 5 star but I just had to give it to them after being blown away by their Jerk Shawarma Poutine today. Who knew you could get such a killer poutine at a Caribbean place! The fries are drizzled with cheese that's melted, smothered in gravy, and littered with their delectable jerk chicken. Get it if you can - but be warned that they usually run out of Jerk Shawarma before the evening hits. Moreover, customer service is on point! The staff is friendly and do their jobs well to make sure everything runs smoothly.  Other things that I've loved are the Oxtail, BBQ jerk chicken, and BBQ Jerk Chicken Wings. Their meals are sizeable as they come with rice and peas, coleslaw, and fried plantain. If you're starved or sharing with someone, you can get an extra leg for $2.5. Their jerk chicken is mild and smoky, but you can add some sweetness by asking for oxtail gravy on top - it's divine! They've also got fish dishes on the Friday and Saturdays. At this rate, I've had enough to know I'm in love with this place."}
{"text":"this place is wayyy overatted.. I tried their curry goat, it was ok but mostly bones, no meat. I also tried their jerk chicken, it tasted sweet, which is nasty. there are so many authentic better Jamaican food in the city than this place. I went there to try the food only because of these fake reviews"}
{"text":"Staying in East Toronto and decided to check this place out because of the amazing reviews. Very small takeout place with a good menu variety. Service was quick and prices were very reasonable for the portion size. They were out of the Jerk Schwarama at (730 on a Monday) which was what I really wanted. I went with the jerk chicken breast instead. The meal came with rice, veggies, and plantains. The chicken was super tender so I didn't even need a knife. The sauce on the rice was amazing. Good flavor on everything. I will be back to try the Schwarama."}
{"text":"Came here with my cousins for dinner.  It's located in my childhood neighbourhood and when you come in it's a little shop with a lot of love.  The people who work there are super nice and friendly.  They make you feel at home.  The food is the bomb.  Love that they use basmati rice for their rice and peas.  Gotta have the of tail, jerk pork, chicken and I have to come back o try their shawarma.  A hidden gem in Scarborough :)"}
{"text":"Finally was able to get my hands on the jerk chicken poutine which was always sold out after 4.   The jerk chicken had great flavor and the gravy was made perfectly.  The portion was not huge but was just about right to fill me up. Would definitely go back and try again!"}
{"text":"Food here is amazing. I really wanted to try the jerk chicken shawarma but sold out by the time we got there around 5pm; will have to try going early next time. This place always seems to be busy. We had the jerk chicken entree and the oxtail entree. Both were fresh and flavourful. Oxtail dish was my favorite, falling off the bones. My husband enjoyed the jerk chicken, spicy and juicy."}
{"text":"Awesome jerk chicken! Kind of an out of the way location but I went around 2-3 with a friend and only had to wait about 10 minutes, wasn't empty as people kept coming and going but we're served promptly.  Ordered the Jerk Chicken that came with rice, steamed vegetables and plaintains. The plaintains were great with the gravy! With tax came to about $11.25 so the one thing I would say is that it's gotten a little pricey for a one-person meal, but it's great food nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Chris Jerk is definitely a hidden gem. Tucked away in a plaza on the corner of Huntingwood and Birchmount, it's my go to when I feel like some savoury and hearty. My regulars are the Beef Oxtail ($13.95) and the Shawarma Sweet Poutine ($9.95). The stewed oxtail is delicious - lots of pieces of large, tender, flavourful fall-off-the-bone beef paired with fresh broccoli, carrots, and caramelized fried plantains over a pile of yummy basmati rice flecked with beans. Super filling.  But a trip to Chris Jerk just isn't complete without an order of their famous Swarma Poutine. I always order the Sweet Poutine as I love the mix of sweet and savoury. This last visit, I found the gravy a little on the saltier side but it worked out well since the fries were very sweet and helped to tone down the saltiness. As always, there was a good amount of cheese and the bits of shaved shawarma added a spicy smokey taste to the poutine."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Curry Chicken and Chicken tenders are to die for.  Limited jerk shawarma serviced mid week.  Oh yeah the jerk shawarma poutine WOW!  If you haven't been here yet you need to try it."}
{"text":"Get here early! The jerk shawarma will sell out. Everything here is home made with love. Please stop telling your friends about this place. Let's keep it all for ourselves"}
{"text":"It's a great place. It feels like you are picking up food from home. It's extremely laid back and the staff is friendly. One of the best places I have tried."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken shawarma was all gone ! The lady said it's usually sold out before 4pm, guess will have to try on a weekend. A chance to try a fish dish as well since it's only available on Fridays and Saturdays. The chef behind the table put a lot of effort into plating each order and to make sure each box was full of food.  The plantain was made fresh to order and the cheese on the poutine melted perfectly. The food was hot and tasted fresh, everything was spiced just right. The jerk chicken was moist even for a breast piece and was definitely spicy. The curried goat was tender and more on the mild side. The coleslaw was the same as most other restaurants, nothing different there.  Overall, definitely coming back on a weekend to try the jerk chicken shawarma poutine."}
{"text":"All I have to say is.. wow. Best jerk chicken I've had, and the jerk chicken shawarma is the best. The meal comes with so much, I couldn't even finish!"}
{"text":"I have had my share of Jerk Chicken spots in the city... ranging from North East south west and Chris Jerk is the best! I have come here for their jerk chicken, jerk poutine and oxtail gravy... No fail... not one... ever! The place is small and very busy but their staff is efficient.... they've got it down. Their portions are generous, the price is fair and the food is just... superior to their competition! Whenever we are in the area we definitely make a stop... Whenever we have an intense crave for Caribbean food... We don't go anywhere else... but expect to wait a bit fot sure. The wait ia worth it! Don't come here if you have never had carribean food because you will never want to go anywhere else. Lol! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place hands down the best ox tail and jerk chicken. I've only came here a few time since they owned a few years back. But the taste is memorable and I go every chance I get. You have to come early for their jerk chicken shrawamas  Monday to Thursday. The ox tail.. omg the ox tail. The best I've ever had. The safe are all friendly and and nice. They place is a bit small but I don't mind as it's mostly takeout kind of place."}
