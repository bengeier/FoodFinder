{"text":"When my family and I walked in we expected restaurant quality food, but in our opinion we didn't get that. The only thing that was good from this trip was customer service, people were nice and they weren't too slow. The food was okay but to us it wasn't worth spending money so I wouldn't go back, although others have liked this restaurant. Everyone is different and it just didn't work out for me."}
{"text":"My favourite dosa spot in GTA. I usually dine in here and occasionally do take outs. Food always feels fresh and got a homemade taste to it. Its a vegetarian restaurant with a cozy and casual atmosphere. The masala dosa is my favourite, it comes with sambar (lentils and veg curry) and three chutneys (coconut,  tomato and a green one). The dosa (crispy crepe) itself is filled with potato curry and its amazing. They do have a lots of dosa varieties and I am yet to try them."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed, my daughter found a piece of sharp plastic or glass that she could have swallowed and poke a hole in her stomach! If there's zero star I would have done it!"}
{"text":"Terrible service with extremely rude staff. Food was average to say the least. Will never be coming back to this horrible place."}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy the food. Idli was rock solid. And the chutney and sambar was equally bad too. Won't be back. Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"So the family and I were craving South Indian food and in particular Dosas. So we looked around where to go and narrowed our search to Madras Restaurant.   Upon arrival we were seated in a busy dining area. The restaurant itself isn't very large but was pretty much full when we arrived. We were given out menus and the staff was nowhere to be found. 2 gentlemen working the whole restaurant.  We ordered our food and for appetizers I ordered a Utapham. Yes yes it's a main fish but I'm one of those people that finds South Indian food to be very light and I gotta have 2 mains to fill me up !! I ordered the tomato, onion and chilli Utapham while my wife ordered sambar-vada. The gentleman that took our order didn't leave me with a lot of confidence so I had to double check with him and my fear was true, he was gonna give me 2 mains while I had ordered them as a appetizer and my main was a masala dosa. The staff lacked confidence.   The food- the food was freshly prepared and was quite hot. The Utapham was a bit too spicy for me but I still enjoyed it. My wife's vada-sambher was really good. My masala dosa originally showed up as a dosa with no filling in it but was quickly corrected. The dosa was tasteful and the sambhar that came with it was flavorful. My wife ordered the special madras dosa which had a spicy chutney layered on. Tea was nothing to write home about. All in all the food is 4/5.  Service- 2/5- slow and painful  Return- probably yes due to the food."}
{"text":"We come here very often. Their Chettinad Masala Dosa and Rava dosa is what we always get. We also get their Combos time to time and they are good too. We've never been disappointed with their food. Their sambar and chutneys are always fresh and yummy.  I would say this place serves food like home cooked meals. Overall would suggest this place to anyone wanting to try Indian food like how its made back home - with lots of flavors."}
{"text":"Forgive my ineptitude with South Indian food, but I didn't really know what a Dosa was. But if you asked me if I wanted a humongous, oversized, flavoured, savory crepe filled with your choice of spicy and intriguing filing, I'd say \"yes please!\". And that, my Yelp friends, is what a dosa is.   This comically large crepe dish (seriously, look at my pic, it's the size of a small baseball bat) was crisp yet soft, and had a bit of heat from chile oil. The filling was a mix of tofu and veggies which was well spiced.   The side sauces were great, my favourite being some sort of tomato puree which I ran through quickly as I mopped up the filling and sauce with my crepe-like awesomeness.  I also had the watermelon juice which was fresh and tasty, but I'd ask for extra ice to get it nice and cold. Super refreshing during the heat wave.  All in all, a great meal for $10! Vegetarian isn't normally my food of choice, but I'm a new fan of dosas, so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and well prepared. The staff are super friendly and the range of dishes is large and innovative - lots of choices I have not experienced before. A great restaurant for Indian food novices and pros alike."}
{"text":"I, along with my 2 young daughters got major case of food poisoning here in March 2018. Do not ever do take out at this restaurant. We were all throwing up all night! I passed out for 18 hours. I reported it to the Food Inspection Agency but I do not want anyone to go through what we did, especially young kids.  Moreover, their service is bad, it's dark and dingy in there, they regularly don't have certain items on their menu.   Don't waste your time, money, and more importantly your health on this crappy ass place!"}
{"text":"Lacks flavour and nothing really stands out.  Ordered chicken 65, got dry over cooked chicken for $11, never mind the portion size which was tiny.  Not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed . I had been to this place a long time ago and like it so I thought i would go back. I know I won't go back again. The masala dosa was terrible, the Sambar was runny the potatoes looked like they were running out and added more water., soggy and tasteless. The Dosa was soggy.   Please save you $$ don't eat here."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh there   The waitress omg she won't even say hii. She just puts menu on table and go    Service is very very poor"}
{"text":"Disappointed!!! Firstly you have to PAY before you sit... then we are informed our order will take 30 min or so... then they served the vada with watered down sambar n chutney.. the thali did not have anything good... waste of time and money.. the pictures at the front are deceiving... would neither refer or go here again! Utter disappointment! :("}
{"text":"Food is good. Taste great lots flavour had the spring dosa. Had a Chinese flavour, very tasty. Lacks service."}
{"text":"Yikes. Food was quite sub par to other South Indian restaurants in the area.  Unable to get a paper dosa or ghee paper roast. The chutneys were really runny. Just not a great dining experience in general. It's too bad because it's so close by."}
{"text":"Absolutely no customer service. I have been here a few times as there is no South Indian restaurant around this place. Tried vegetarian food - Varieties of Dosa Idly, taste is ok and pricey."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to check this place out. I ordered the Chettinadu Kara Masala and it was SOOOOOO delicious, if you don't like spice then don't bother but the flavours were amazing and the dosa was fresh, not soggy. My friend ordered the Special Madras Dosa and enjoyed it. Our other friend ordered the paper dosa and it was her favourite from before. To start we ordered Idly and it was fluffy and light. The chutneys were delicious too. Overall we were very satisfied with the food as well as the service."}
{"text":"Your adverage Indian food expectations.  Quality is nothing to rave about... nothing stood out.  I was not impressed with the service and found their staff to be quite rude.  With that said... I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place use to be good but they recently changed the cook and the food is flavourless. The servers lack customer service. I had to get up a few times to ask for more water. They just stand behind the counter. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Newly opened South Indian restaurant stands out from the rest of the pack for its simplicity and shift away from \"mass produced\" food.  The Madras full meals is recommended both for the first timer wanting to get a  taste of South Indian food or those yearning for home cooked food.  If you are adventerous, there's also a Dosa for every palette from the signature Masala dosa to Italian inspired cheese dosas. Pure vegetarian. Clean ambience."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurant that I have ever been to. We ordered dosa and I cant believe we got a soggy and cold dosa. We returned it and told them to give another one. The second one tasted really bad. Infact, I wont even call it dosa, i would call it wet hand-kerchief served in a plate. The dahi vada ( dumpling dipped in yogurt ) was also bad! The dumpling was not cooked properly and I can taste the raw dough.   The funny thing is they switched off all the lights in the restaurant before 1 hr of closing time. They had only one light above our table and we were eating. Cheap restaurant and cheap food! Please stay away. Iam quite surprised why ppl gave 4+ rating for this restaurant and I went there with good hopes. But, we were disappointed."}
