{"text":"The macarons here are a work of art. They have mastered these little desserts to be the perfect mix of a bit of crispiness, followed by a delicious chewy center, and then followed by a burst of subtle flavor. How can a burst be subtle, you ask? Try one and find out."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience here today. I've had macarons from all over the world and these were some of the best! The employee who helped me (unfortunately I didn't catch her name) was lovely. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I walked in and almost walked right back out after seeing the prices . Each macaron was $2.50 and the other small pastries and cakes were $5-$7. I'm all for paying for quality but these prices were pretty intimidating for a poor college student. 
I ended up purchasing two macarons, salted caramel (the most popular I was told) and a passionfruit chocolate. The salted caramel delicious but the passionfruit chocolate was just okay. They are of decent size and the amount of filling is just perfect.
So if you can afford it, go for it."}
{"text":"Tried a macaroon and four different pastries today (hey, I split it with two other people). I just can't believe how good they looked both on the outside and the inside. And the texture/taste was interesting and complex. I'm still reeling from the entire experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The macaroons are surreal. These are unlike anything I have ever tasted! Gabby Et Jules is a must see. We bring every out of town visitor here because it is so unusual and fantastic! It's very dangerous living so close due to how fantastic it is!"}
{"text":"The most lovely deserts I had ever seen, and also quite delicious as well. The staff is very knowledgable and informed me that the chefs studied their craft in Paris, which makes this place totally legit. 
I tried the macaroons (they have 19 flavors!) and was very impressed. The tastes are light and natural and not too sweet. 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried the Pear Cheesecake and it was so delicious, not too sweet either! Also had my first eclair which was very tasteful and creamy. I would love come here again. This bakery shop has an assortment of creative pastries such as macarons and small, delicious cakes."}
{"text":"The macarons are pricey, too sweet and not crispy enough on the outside.

I would rather travel to la gourmadine on butler to get my macaron fix. The la gourmadine ones taste awsome and way cheaper."}
{"text":"Le Pittsburgh, Rose, and Lavender are my favorites! Flavors are not overly sweet or overpowering. Just perfect."}
{"text":"The pastries are beautiful and delicious, but to pay $9 for four macaroons? I just don't think the pricing is realistic for most people. I will probably be back but won't be getting more than two macaroons at a time. If they adjust their prices, I will give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Macarons had no flavor to them...I bought six different kinds and every one tasted exactly the same."}
{"text":"I have been ordering cakes from this place in the past two years, it's always been great experience. However not sure what is going on with the manage team, i was told that they couldn't resend confirmation email after my third chasing calls. They charged my credit card in 5 second, but the sell associate never called me to let me know that they had problem sending me confirmation email. I was waiting all day long, then when I called the third time, they hang up the phone. RUDE, very unrespectful. The manager showed no apologize and was very impatient. Cake is good, customer service experience was horrible."}
{"text":"When I stepped into the store, I was pretty excited because the desserts looked amazing. However, in a city where competition of baked goods is pretty hardcore, I felt that Gaby Et Jules under-performed. Not to mention, it was expensive.

Macarons:
My opinion of a good macaron, although may well be misplaced, is good texture and pronounced, vibrant flavors. While they had good texture, I felt the flavor was pretty bland. I enjoy floral flavors and hoped to smell and taste the rose, earl grey, etc. Instead, I felt like I just had a plain, sweet macaron with maybe an afterthought of flavor. If I have to sit in my seat, squinting my already tiny eyes, focusing on the flavor, that's not a good macaron in my opinion. Nonetheless, they were okay macarons and if it were just for these, the place would've gotten a 3 stars.

French Baguette:
I was extremely unimpressed with the baguette. While my girlfriend and I were getting the macarons for our expensive study break, the person working there spoke on about how they imported the flour from France and so on. In all honesty, they were kinda pushy with trying to get you to buy more than what you intend to buy. Anywho, I caved in because... bread... those seductive carbs.

Begin my rant here: doesn't matter what country your flour is from, it's not like American flour is inferior. \"Yay! Let's all hate on American stuff\" - every hipster ever. It's about the protein content, how well it's processed, and baking techniques (requiring experience and patience). TONS of bakeries in Pittsburgh use \"American flour\" and make amazing bread. Please don't use \"we use French flour\" as a selling point if the technique and final product is extremely tough, tears at the roof of your mouth, and interior is deflated and dry. End rant.

Overall, lesson learned. I went here because it was close to where I was working and hours were open late. Next time, I will plan ahead and drive to my favorite bakeries further out."}
{"text":"First experience at Gaby et Jules this morning, it was ah-ma-zzzzing!   We love Bouchon Bakery on the West Coast and this place was every bit as good.   Delicious and WIDE assortment of macaroons; dense and flavorful just the way we like em!  The chocolate croissant and \"Pittsburgh Paris\" also comes highly recommended.  The shop is very stylish and the wait staff were friendly.  Can't wait until they have their \"hard\" open and hopefully have some coffee and espresso items on the menu."}
{"text":"Very consistent classical preparation, and the resulting goods are universally delicious.  On par with La Gourmandine.  However, the prices are a little absurd.  Not just for Pittsburgh, but for Manhattan or Paris.  Perhaps I am paying for the ambience - the clerks all seem to be Francophones - but it really makes me feel a little gullible.

Stop in for a treat when you want something special.  Think twice before swinging by to get something for a gathering, or even for a family dessert."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Wednesday evening at 6pm. Only 5 varieties of macaroons remained. I loved the Earl Grey and passion fruit with chocolate macaroons. My friend remarked that the mint macaroon was like biting into a mint leaf--so delicious. Another friend had Le Tonga, which he loved.

The store is beautiful and clean. The desserts are beautiful. Gaby and Jules are very friendly.

This place, however, gets a 3 in my book because it is expensive. Individual macaroons are $2.25 each, a half dozen can be had for $13 .

I'm glad we have a new stop on the pastry lover's circuit in Pittsburgh and I will be back to devour the rest of your desserts!"}
{"text":"We don't see what all the hype is about. We tried the following flavors:  ROSE AND VANILLA.

Almost $3 a piece, it's definitely not worth it. We ordered rose flavor first. It tasting nothing like rose. It tasted like almond. Any low quality macaroon will taste like almond regardless of the \"named flavor\" or color. We went back to the store and talked to the staff and shared our experience. They were nice enough to offer us to try another flavor. We asked which flavor had the strongest flavor. Of all thoce choices, she said \"Vanilla\". It says it all. 

Our dear friends tried six different ones after us and said \"all of the flavors were mediocre and some of them you just couldn't tell what they tasted like.\"  I feel like they have no idea what they are doing and they are getting away with it. They assume Pittsburgh does not deserve better. It does! 

This store would not survive a month in NYC or Paris or another metropolitan area.

The silver lining; nice staff."}
{"text":"There's no other way to enjoy true French pastries without actually going to France. Incredibly delicious macaroons and cakes, almond bread and of course baguettes. 5 STARS!!! VIP CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance , beautiful decor, gorgeous pastries, great staff and sparkling clean. Our favorite desert today was the Pina Colada. My favorite desert place. Worth the drive from the South Hills."}
{"text":"As soon as my mom and I walked in, we were greeted by a cheery \"Bonjour!\" The shop is clean and bright. We were overwhelmed by the number of different pastries and had trouble choosng just one to share (we'd just had a very filling dinner). One of the girls behind the counter was extremely patient and helpful as we tried to choose.

We ended up with Le croustillant aux 3 chocolats and enjoyed it a lot! The chocolate was rich and delicious, and the presentation was great. The outdoor seating was a great place to enjoy dessert on a warm evening. 

Unfortunately, the price here is not something a college student can afford daily, but I'll definitely remember this place for a treat in the future."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3 stars for the pastry.

And 3 stars for the surly service.

We were greeted with \"Bonjour!\" as soon as we walked in.  But, my indecision made a couple of the staff very nervous for some reason.  As I tried to make up my mind, one of the staff barked at my kids, \"Don't touch the signs.\"

We finally ended up with a variety of 8 macarons and a pain au chocolat.  Total pricetag: $20.70.

Yikes, that added up in a hurry.

The macarons were good.  Not easy to find in Pittsburgh so I guess this is going to be my default place even though the service isn't great and it just seems pricey for Pittsburgh.

My pain au chocolat - what it lacked in chocolate in made up for in butter in the croissant.  Just meh."}
{"text":"I had a tough week and decided to treat myself to a pastry. I spent several minutes just admiring the esthetics--the cases looked beautiful. I am not a huge fan of the macaron so I bought a Paris-Brest. This is a lovely round pastry cut in half lengthwise and filled with a praline cream. It was absolutely delicious. I cannot wait to go back and try other things, even if it is a bit expensive."}
{"text":"More expensive and not as good as La Gourmandine. Beautiful store and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Just picked up a box of 15 macarons, my favorite: Pistachio! The outer shell was delicate but didn't crumble in my hand. The insides were so moist and full of flavor. 

The other flavors I tried were Passionfruit-Chocolate, Gingerbread, Raspberry and Lemon. There were all delicious and magnificent to my taste buds.

If you're looking for a beautiful gift for hosts that isn't just a bottle of wine, these are perfect."}
{"text":"While the store itself is very cute, the prices here are excessively expensive, not only compared to other local French bakeries but also to some of my favorites in larger cities such as New York and Seattle. $5.50 for an almond croissant - which was truly nothing notable - is absurd. Also, the Paris-Brest was borderline stale."}
{"text":"I buy from here semi-regularly, and have never been disappointed.  Their macaron sleeves make a great gift and are a real crowd pleaser, they are perfect for buying ahead of time if you are cooking for a group and can't be bothered with dessert.  My favorites have probably been their great selection of pastries, though, which I buy from time to time as a breakfast treat.  Some of my favorites have been Le Fragrant, which had like a violent almond meringue with a sherbet-like inside, and Le Tonga, which was pretty much like the best banana pudding."}
{"text":"I LOVE their macarons, they have so many flavors to choose from as well! Beautifully decorated store as well. This is my go-to place when I need a gift for someone and I'm not sure what to get them. Any of their goodies are perfect, even aside from the macarons. Their pastries are always so beautiful and tasty."}
{"text":"Out of 5:
2.5 - Croissants: fluffy, though a bit dry
1.0 - Brioche: dry
1.5 - Almond Croissant: filling has an odd flavor, but was fluffier than other places."}
{"text":"We ordered the almond macaroons as favors for our wedding. The macaroons were packaged individually in clear boxes with white ribbons. The favors looked elegant and tasted delicious. We received many complements."}
{"text":"Weirdly I've never had a thing for macarons BUT my friends introduced me to macarons last summer and ever since then I've just fell in love with them. They're amazing! And recently this summer my friend took me to this place and OH. MY. GOD. I found my new go to place for macarons  so so delicious and good"}
{"text":"!!Macaron tasting!!

Got 12 of the 18 available, also a canele.. very dense, moist in middle with crunchy caramelized exterior, an excellent balance between custard and dough. 

The macarons are flaky, light, and balanced, at times too confectionary. By preference

1) coffee - starts doughy like phyllo, roast grows softly, warmly, growing but never overpowering, dense

2) Nutella - sweeter than chocolate, doughier in end, more complex

3) maple bacon - maple-bacon conjurs sticky images of 2000 calorie cavities. Not here! Balanced with actual bacon pieces

4) Caramel - more almond than caramel, high cream low sugar decent salt

5) Chocolate - dense but flavorful

6) Honey - not overly sweet, too much cream, light confectionary at finish

7) raspberry - heavy cream dairy overload up until late finish when raspberry bursts with seediness, then falls like a cliff

8) Pistachio - moderate confection up front, pistachio grows mid, dry medium body, moderate density

9) lemon - light density, sherbet heavy brightness mid, low sweetness but lemon inauthentic

10) almond - almond extract flavor, very sweet and synthetic, light

11) earl gray - lighter tea notes amidst confection, very creamy almost lime sherbet-like, less dense = more confectionary

12) white choc Basil - basil heavy, overwhelming, low chocolate/sugar, moderate cream, light"}
{"text":"Gaby Et Jules is a pretty good bakery. It's very striking and modern looking compared to the rest of Squirrel Hill. The selection inside is small and the prices are high. I bought a box of macarons and I enjoyed most of them. The lavender was my favorite, the salted caramel was okay and the white chocolate basil was the worst of the seven. The girl working the counter was very helpful and gave me some pretty good suggestions. Not bad but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Clean store, friendly and patient staff, and amazing presentation.  This place is for those 'Treat Yo Self' days.  I appreciate that each individual item on display has been given detailed attention.
I've tried raspberry, chocolate, peach violet, lavender, le pittsburgh, blueberry, and lemon macarons.  Each macaron was perfectly crafted with a slightly crisp shell that perfectly blends with a flavorful filling.   The French canale (a first try for me) was a caramelized shell cradling  a spongy custard inside.  When I purchase this again, I plan to pair it with some fresh berries. My hubby had a L'Opera pastry which was a perfect dessert that blended coffee buttercream and chocolate.  I had a seasonal dessert with berries, gel, a half of a macaron shell, and macaron filling-it was one of the best things that I've ever eaten!

The macarons are packaged in a cute red box, and would make a nice gift for someone that you like enough to share with :) My waist and my wallet are happy that this bakery isn't closer,"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and each time I get 2 or 3 macarons.  As other reviewers have said, the macarons aren't cheap but you are paying in part for the novelty of some of the flavors and the overall presentation.  If you think $2.25 per cookie is outrageous macarons just aren't for you.  My favorite flavor I've had is the special Pittsburgh one (I suspect that it's lemon and chocolate though they're keep it a secret) all the fruit flavors are good as well.  Even some of the more unusual flavors, like rose and white basil chocolate definitely provide a new sweets experience even though I don't think I would necessarily try them again."}
{"text":"Everything I've had from Gaby Et Jules is fantastic. From their macarons, to their lemon tartalette, to their croissants and pains au chocolate, everything is delicious and flawlessly executed. 

The folks at the counter are also very courteous and the decor is beautiful. A wonderful addition to Squirrel Hill!"}
{"text":"I've only had the macarons, but they keep bringing me back! Some flavors get a little sweet, but overall they offer a nice variety and the flavors match their description. The chocolate macarons are rich but not overpowering. The nougatine/honey I tried was on the sweet side, but still very flavorful. They have been fresh every time, with the right amount of chew and crisp. 
The shop is clean, the staff is fairly friendly, and the decor is inviting.
Gaby et Jules is on the pricey side if you want to try a bunch of macarons, but the quality is good. I've also found that a small box of different flavors make a very nice gift! (All macaron recipients have been delighted.)"}
{"text":"I've had macarons from all over Pittsburgh and Gaby et Jules are the best. Their prices are expensive, but it's worth it. I haven't tried any other of their sweets for their price tags but they are all beautifully presented."}
{"text":"Gaby et Jules is a great French boulangerie and patisserie. Note that I didn't say \"French-style\" or \"French-theme.\" No, this is the real deal or rather très authentique! My wife and I lived for a couple of years in France and frequented local neighborhood/village stores for bread and tasty pastry treats. This place is exactly what you'd expect to find tucked away on a chic little side street in Paris or on the fancy main street of the nicer villages and towns of France.

Gaby et Jules has perfectly replicated the in-store experience and, most importantly, the taste and quality of the products. We tried a baguette (which was about half-eaten by the time we had walked the 10-minute walk home!), croissant, and a pastry called Paris-Brest (a circular choux pastry, sort of in the shape of a donut, with hazelnut cream sandwiched in between). Everything was delicious and authentic.

The service was good. Efficiency is what you want in a busy store like this, and the staff moved things along quickly, even though other customers seemed to have many questions that needed to be answered.

Perhaps the coolest part of the experience is looking through the large glass panels to the kitchen where the head pastry chef (a French guy who has worked at some of the best patisserie in Paris) and his team are hard at work. 

This is a great addition to Squirrel Hill. The best part is that it isn't an American bakery pretending to be French with substandard products. This is the real deal. Think what you will of the French and their often peculiar ways, but they do know how to make a great baguette (and macaron, croissant, etc, etc). Having something like this in Pittsburgh is great to see. Merci beaucoup Lori et Frédéric"}
{"text":"Macaroons are definitely a rare purchase for me, for the price, I can get 3 donuts which are my personal favorite. However, there's just something about the texture that I absolutely love, along with the unique flavors as well. 

First time I actually made it into this bakery, although I have had them before. Unique setup, friendly staff, and excellent sweets outside of the macaroons. I tried the lemon tartlette which was fantastic.

Macaroons will cost you about $2.25 a piece and are relatively small, but certainly not overpriced. Market District sells larger ones for about the same price and I enjoy them as well, but these guys win on flavor options alone."}
{"text":"In order to assess this place, you have to balance the quality of the product with the price of the product.  I went there for the first time on Saturday, and it was ok.  Just ok.  The macarons were fine - a little too sweet for my tastes, though - and at $2.00+ per macaron it really wasn't worth it.  The quality of each macaron half (i.e. without the filling) was the same as the macaroons that can be purchased at Moio's in Monroeville - at a much lower price.  The quality of the macarons at Gaby et Jules just didn't justify the high price - it just didn't - regardless of how much high-end packaging the pastries were wrapped in.  I can't begin to imagine what the profit margin is that they're making off of each macaron."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this place is delicious, but it is pretty expensive for a cookie. I had the white chocolate basil and it had an excessive amount of basil. Everything looks beautiful there, but I still couldn't get over the price for how small it was."}
{"text":"I've had many macarons, including ones from famous bakeries in San Francisco and New York. I can honestly say that Gaby Et Jules makes wonderful macarons and pastries, and I am so excited they are in my neighborhood! I love supporting local businesses that put their heart and soul into their products, and this place does just that. Every pastry is meticulously crafted, and beautiful to look at. There were many samples when I stopped in, and everything was delicious. I got 6 macarons, and loved each one. Will definitely return, and bring my French friends when they are in town."}
{"text":"My friend got me macaroons from this place and they all are awesome! High recommend the coffee and chocolate. The flavor is very strong"}
{"text":"Overall, this place is very good and I will definitely return to try more.

The store is beautiful and clean, and the pastries behind the case all look amazing! They have a huge variety of different flavored macaroons, and the staff is incredibly friendly and ready to help answer any questions you might have. 

I came here to pick up a pastry to surprise my fiance, but of course I couldn't leave without at least trying the macaroons. They're on the pricey side, so I decided to try three: lavender, raspberry, and almond. The lavender macaroon was very good. The flavor was okay but the macaroon itself was perfect. The inside was soft and creamy. The outside had a nice bite. My favorite, the almond one, was also perfect and the flavor was wonderful. The raspberry one missed the mark on consistency. It was sort of chewy and sticky, which isn't ideal for a macaroon. Hopefully this is an anomaly because the other macaroons were delicious.

As for the pastries, they were great. Not the best pastries I've had, but great nevertheless. My fiance's chocolate one was definitely a hit. I had the L'Opera one and the coffee flavor in the pastry was outstanding.

Definitely worth stopping in and trying a few flavors. I know I'll be back for the raspberry pastry over cream filling -- It was difficult NOT to buy it this time around!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is amazing!  I can't say enough good things about it.  The desserts we bought were phenomenal and we will definitely be back!  The staff are professional, helpful and welcoming and you can see the pastry chefs working in the kitchen through the glass window to the back of the shop.  Go early in the day for the best selection - if you go too late in the day you will find yourself out of luck.  Gaby et Jules is a major asset to the Forbes Avenue community."}
{"text":"Gorgeous brightly lit store. Friendly service. The desserts look impeccably decorated with extreme attention to detail.

But holy crap is it expensive. $2.25 per macaron of that size? DAMN. They tasted average, though the texture was great. I do like the occasional macaron and I found these way too sweet. Maybe others can give a more legit verdict but I'm not too crazy about them personally, at least not willing to pay for it at this price.

Lower prices would do this place wonders. It would make them seem less full of themselves - not that they necessarily are, but it leaves a bad impression when the food doesn't quite live up to the price tag."}
{"text":"This is a special place. Definitely far from average. The desserts here are not only unique, but they are delicious and beautiful works of art. You won't find baguettes or croissants here, but that's ok because we need a place like in our lives. To show us what fine French pastry and dessert is all about! The quality of these goods is second to none, and you are getting the real deal. It's not a large bakery, and there is no indoor seating. There is some outdoor seating for when the weather allows. The interior feels fancy, but not gaudy. You walk in, peruse and take out. The bakery is visible in the back, so you can observe the chefs in action. They have a large selection of macarons, a variety of flavors.  The pastries are toward the front, with appropriate signage to tell you what they're made with and their price. This is so helpful because by looking at them you would definitely not know what kind of dessert they are- they're almost too beautiful to eat! Everything I have tried here was delicious, nothing has disappointed including the macarons. From the entrance to the packaging, the entire experience is excellent. This is the kind of store you see on high end 5th Ave. in New York City. It's pricey but worth the indulgence when you can."}
{"text":"i can now update my review. The croissants are fine, butt they are pricey, and I am not sure I will often bother going there to buy croissants for my breakfast. 

The highlights are the pastries - I tried 5/6 of them and they were all delicious. They know how to do their mousses (lemon, pistachio - the latter was amazing), and their \"frians\" (the crispy bottom of some pastries - e.g. chocolate) are terrific. 

Very nice gift for a party"}
{"text":"In the past year, I have developed a bit of a love affair with macarons. Being home for Christmas, I knew I needed to see what Pittsburgh had to offer. I tried a half dozen.

White chocolate basil: basil heavy at first, but ended up being very good

Earl grey: great flavor, but I think mine had too much gel. This is not my preferred type of macaron filling, so I was a bit sad as Earl grey is usually my favorite flavor.

Le Pittsburgh: The Bailey's really comes through. Thumbs up from me. I don't know if the cookies were done differently, but they seemed especially tasty.

Lemon: strong flavor. More tart than refreshing. Not for me.

Sugar Plum (seasonal): A beautiful purple with sugar coating. Get it if you can!

A brown one: Okay, so I ate these the day after I got them and I couldn't remember my 6th flavor. There were a few tiny pieces of nut on the cookie. This was by far my favorite though!

Prices are comparable ($1 more for 6) to what I pay regularly in Cincinnati and the sizes are the same. G+J has a lot of interesting and unique flavors to keep you coming back."}
{"text":"So happy that this place came to Squirrel Hill. We already had places to get good bread, but desserts? This place is a winner! Everything I've tried so far has been fabulous. While the macarons are pricey, as a baker, I can attest to the TLC that goes into crafting them, so I am very willing to pay the price for these delectable little treats."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't written a review yet.

I've been here so many times, sampled the majority of what they have to offer, and every. Single. One. Is. Good. Great, even. Awesome, arguably. Probably tried just about all of the pastries. And a large percentage of their macaron flavours.

The Millefeuille is a light, flaky, custardy treat topped with a sweet sugar rush that is somehow hard to be sick of. Almost buy this thing regularly.

Le Royal is the elegance and seduction of deep, dark chocolate itself. Even it's twisted, angular, shiny body mocks me from memory.

Fruity flavours like Feronia and Bavarois (which may vary seasonally) always bring a fun tang to the tastebuds.

And this place has fun with making special treats for special events and the holidays, too. Mother's day, Christmas, sports-related et cetera. I've just finished the last slice of the pistachio-flavoured Galette des Rois they're offering for January and I am very, very satisfied. This place has mastered flakiness paired with creams and flavours.

The best part is, each little thing is still relatively affordable and comes in presentable boxes and bags, which is just the perfect balance between the sort of thing you can get once in a while when the fancy strikes, and something you reserve for special occasions.

The only thing I'm not sure they top for me are the macarons. Don't get me wrong, they're very good. And some of them have fun flavours I haven't seen elsewhere. But the cookies of the macaron were a touch underdone the last I had them here (which was quite a while ago). Wouldn't hesitate to get some here if I were in the mood though.

Service has always been warm and friendly here, sometimes even charming. For a french patisserie, it really is as good as it gets! Easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"So good, it should be illegal!  The macaroons are DELICIOUS!!  I recently came here for the 1st time to buy some treats for my Valentine and I was super impressed!!  All of the macaroons had such intense and delicious flavors!!  We loved them so much that I returned a few days later to get more!  Can't wait to go back again!  I also love how cute the store is and that they speak French!  This place is a \"must-try\" for sure!  Love!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Very good macarons in a cute shop in a great little neighborhood.  My brother-in-law and his family live in Squirrel Hill and said that we needed to visit this shop when we were in town, so we picked up a dozen macarons and a small orange tart for dessert one night.  The macarons were tasty--maybe not the best I've ever had, but certainly very good.  Of the ones we tried, chocolate and coffee were probably my favorites.  Peach-lavender and raspberry were also good, and I don't usually like lavender-flavored things.  Since we were there late in the day, they were out of pistachio, which is one flavor I usually judge a new macaron place by.  Wuh wuh.

The orange tart was basically dreamsicle-flavored.  Yum.  The crust was nice and light, as was the filling.  I was so bummed that I accidentally dropped the tart upside down, as they didn't offer me a bag to carry our 2 boxes.  Not sure what's up with that, but word to the wise...ask for a bag.  The macarons and tart cost just over $30 altogether, so you want your desserts to be intact when you get home!  

Service was friendly, and when I made a very sad face upon being told that they were out of chocolate macarons, someone appeared from the back with more!  :)  How nice.  Got to try their baguette and pain au chocolat the next day.  Very good.  Of course, not as good as in Paris, but hey--we aren't in Paris, are we!  Overall, I'd recommend Gaby et Jules for getting your French pastry fix on."}
{"text":"High-quality, beautiful desserts that are pricey, but worth it. 
Gaby Et Jules has style. There is no denying it. 

From their sleek store exterior, to the great windows displays to their bright open interior the whole place feels fresh, clean and new. The same can be said for their many desserts. 

The first thing you'll notice is that all of the desserts LOOK amazing. Half of the display case is a rainbow of macarons of every flavor you could imagine, while the other half if full of gorgeous patisseries. 

But how does everything taste? My son calls Gaby Et Jules \"The Delicious Cookie Store\" and the name is appropriate. My favorite macarons are the almond, chocolate and lime (which is really refreshing). In terms of patisserie I enjoy the Opera and the Meteor - both filling and beautiful to look at. 

Gaby Et Jules is not cheap, but its craftsmanship and quality make it worth it."}
{"text":"I got the raspberry and white chocolate basil macarons ($2.25 each). The raspberry was great, but not any better than the $1.75 raspberry macarons I have had before. DO NOT GET THE WHITE CHOCOLATE BASIL. I was trying to be adventurous with this flavor pick and it totally backfired. White chocolate and basil are not meant to be together and I am a lover of both! Overall I probably would not recommend because of the price."}
{"text":"What can I say.......Magnificent
  The best Macarons et Canele ever.
  If I only had 1 week to live, I'd spend most of it here."}
{"text":"Walking into Gaby et Jules I was immediately captivated by the pastries. They looked absolutely beautiful. All of the different shapes, colors and textures. Not only was there a variety, but each one looks absolutely perfect. I had to stop wondering how it was possible to make these and start figuring out which one I wanted to eat, otherwise I might have stood there all day. I was a little intimidated by the descriptions. I wish I had brushed up on my French and maybe brought along a dictionary of pastry terms. After reading all of the cards, I realized, how can I go wrong as long as it looks like chocolate and doesn't have something I don't like as an ingredient. 
I finally chose 2. One was a long rectangle covered in glistening chocolate. Inside was a delicate cake surrounded by mousse with just a hint of a crunch.
The second was cylinder of chocolate mousse with a Carmel filling. They were Bo the kind of food you ate with very small bites, savoring each morsel and trying to identify all of the shuttle favors and textures."}
{"text":"I was in town for a wedding a few weeks ago and stopped here before grabbing dinner to ensure we could pick up some macarons before closing. The interior was very bright, white, and sparkly clean, which enabled you to really center your attention to their macaron case and their other many intricate desserts. The flavors that I went with were vanilla bean & basil, pistachio, salted caramel, lavender, rose petal, and a chocolate. I ate them over a span of a few days, which all remained fresh even through the drive back home, and each flavor was amazing. Their filling is much more creamy and more whipped then other macarons I've tried, but I loved it! The most interesting flavor was the vanilla bean & basil.. I am a huge fan of basil, and although the basil was a little strong at first taste, it all pulled together really well with the sweetness of the vanilla. I would highly suggest coming here if you haven't done so yet because they are absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The pastries here are incredible! Definitely one of the best bakeries in Pittsburgh comparable to many patisseries in Paris"}
{"text":"Excellent bakery and the macaroons were amazing, very flavorful and not too sweet!! Cant wait for them to offically open so we can visit ofter!!!!!"}
{"text":"The authenticity of having a French server at a French bakery is great. Excellent service and decor. Watching macarons being made in the kitchen was fun. By the way, apparently the French pronunciation of macaron ends on the o. The croissants are also fantastic! 

If you're going to complain about the price, go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Soooooo delicious.  But sooooo expensive.  But delicious.  My wallet's tellin me no, but my stomach's tellin me yes.  

Sea salt caramel and earl Greg are my favorite macaroon flavors, but everyone that I go with has a different favorite, so mix it up.  Croissants and French loaves are pretty cheap but also delicious."}
{"text":"I confess I think macarons are overrated. They are pretty and have a fun texture, but I do not see the point in having entire shops dedicated to them. But Gaby et Jules is more than macarons. They have an assortment of desserts that are *almost* to pretty to eat. But you should definitely eat them.

My boyfriend suggested going in for dessert. Everything was shiny and gorgeous and some of the colors were so vibrant they looked more like candy than pastries. Ultimately, I shied away from the technicolor gelees and opted for a poached pear cheesecake and some kind of chocolate-on-chocolate mousse but let me be clear: they didn't look like cheesecake and mousse. Each was a work of art. Although there is a cafe table out front, there is no seating inside the shop so we took our selections to-go. Both were amazing, but the chocolate-on-chocolate was a little less interesting. The pear dessert had an amazing blend of textures and was truly a delight.

It's not an every day thing, but if you are looking for something special and fun this place is worth checking out. I do kind of wish you could eat there and maybe have a coffee or tea with it, but I guess that's not really what they are going for."}
{"text":"There is not enough wonderful things to say about these macrons. It's heaven for your mouth!"}
{"text":"Best macarons this side of Paris!

I've been looking forward to trying the macarons here since I moved to Pittsburgh a few months ago -- I was not disappointed!  There are so many flavors to choose from that it's hard to pick a favorite but if I had to I'd go with the salted caramel.  The staff is friendly and patient as folks decide on which treat to select.

I tried a canele the first time I visited and it just might be my new favorite treat.  Eventually I'm sure I'll try something else but for now the canele & macaron are enough of a reason to make a special trip :)"}
{"text":"These macaroons are a true delight. The display truly in like fine patisserie shops in France. I love the chocolate croissants but I got for the macaroons. I think they're about as perfect as can be and the best  I've had in Pittsburgh. The packaging also makes them the perfect choice for a gift - birthdays, weddings, you name it."}
{"text":"French pastries are amazing! =)
Prices aren't. =( 
But you get what you pay for! =)"}
{"text":"5 stars for macarons - very good selection of flavor, delicate and consistent structure, plus balanced flavor
4 stars for desserts - consistently good quality without any Wow's in my opinion. Very limited and common selection in a daily basis. 
3 stars for price - I am glad that there comes a fine quality pâtisserie in Pittsburgh, but sorry to say, with their selection and quality of cakes, they are over priced. I believe David could do better tho. PGH needs more inspiring personal sized cakes, please!"}
{"text":"I love their macarons, lemon tarts, and chocolate eclairs. The lemon tart has a crunch pie like crust with a tangy lemon filling and soft marshmellow like topping. Soooo amazing.

Rose and earl grey are my favorite macaron flavors."}
{"text":"The place is really clean. The croissants are to die for, which I suppose justifies their exorbitant prices. I saw the owner/manager/or working speaking really rudely to a customer about taking photographs. Kinda turned me off so won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"3 words: BEST MACARONS EVER!!! 
I came here on my recent visit to Pittsburgh and picked up a small box of 6 macarons ($13). They were worth every penny!! I picked the unique flavors because YOLO. The white chocolate basil was freakin bomb dot com! It had a rich chocolate flavor that was balanced perfectly by the hint of basil :) the rose and nougatine were also amazing! Just check this place out, you won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"Before I left Pittsburgh I wanted to try some desserts. This place is located inside a market. The attendant is super nice, she has a slight accent but it's understandable. She gives great recommendations and is friendly. There is a sitting area in the market! Try the salted caramel macaron! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  What a letdown.

Maybe I let hype get to me again, but overall, Gaby Et Jules just didn't satisfy my expectations of what a good macaroon should be.  From an atmosphere perspective... although the owner and staff were extremely happy to serve us... the whole white glove affair just seemed a little stuffy.

I decided to splurge and get a few different types of macaroons and a pastry.  Ignoring the sticker shock I endured (almost $3 per macaroon... really?), I was incredibly underwhelmed by quality, complexity and ingenuity of the options.

Do yourself a favor and grab some macaroons from a non-traditional spot (such as Marty's Market, or if you have the privvy...  simplified versions at the Duquesne Club) as these babies just aren't up to par."}
{"text":"I am surprised by all of the positive reviews for this French bakery.

I tried several flavors of the macarons including sea salt caramel, vanilla and earl gray - all of which were underwhelming. Good texture but the taste was lacking. I was most disappointed w/ the sea salt caramel (my favorite macaron flavor ever!) because the filling tasted like cheap cake frosting. 

$2.25 for a tiny macaron is pretty steep, especially since I pay $1.75 in San Francisco, $2.75 in NYC (at Lauderee) and $1.25 in Columbus for a better macaron. I don't mind paying premium prices for desserts (given my huge sweet tooth) but the macarons at Gaby et Jules are just not worth it.

Also, I cannot believe the almond croissants here are $5.50! The ones over at La Gourmadine are $3.75 (?) and amazing.

I had such high hopes for this bakery especially since it is within walking distance from my apartment, but I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Their dessert is very pretty and fancy but pretty expensive. It tastes good but not any better than any other French bakery places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I had a pistachio macaron yesterday, and it was so delicious. I love experimenting with baking, but when it comes to macarons, I lose patience. Now I can run up to Forbes and grab delicious, fresh macarons whenever I want!

Because they are in the meat of their grand opening and are now taking orders for the holidays, make sure to stop by to sample some delicious treats. Make sure to get your order in quickly as they have a five day waiting period for some of their fancier concoctions. 

I am so glad Pittsburgh has a true French patisserie. The bright candy apple red exterior is both fun and inviting. I couldn't resist adding a chocolate croissant before checking out, and I wasn't disappointed! Make sure to stop in and talk to the staff. They are extremely helpful, and can point you in the right direction, no matter what flavor profile you enjoy. They have equally delicious options for chocolate lovers and fruity types."}
{"text":"Macrons 3/5: very mediocre macarons at a high cost. I do not recommend getting them if you really like macarons. I have had excellent expert macarons from NY/LA, so my standards are high....however...

Other pastries: are excellent but also at a high price. I love the napoleon there. The creme is true custard, not vanilla pudding tasting. The choux pastry of the eclairs are also excellent. 

Overall Taste; 4/5
Overall Price: 3/5"}
{"text":"I keep give this place so many chances and every single time it fails. Ive tried probably almost every single dessert there and there hasn't been anything I truly love. The presentation of every single item is sooooo beautiful but the taste is subpar for sure. Today they had a new item. A giant macaron with chocolate ganache and nuts. You'd think the macaron would be flawless since that's what they specialize in but half of it was stuck on the presentation plate and it was just hard and not flakey like a macaron. I'm not saying they tried to imitate la gournandine's big macaron but I want to say if you're expecting that quality you won't get it from here. I am someone who enjoys bakeries A LOT and this is one of my least favorites. For a French bakery I am very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've sampled their wares several times in the last week or two due to the generosity of coworkers bringing croissants in to work, but today was my first experience in the actual shop. It's beautiful inside -- shiny and clean, and the staff seem friendly. There's even a full wall window where you can watch the food being made.

The croissants seem roughly on par with those from French bakeries in town, and the macaroon I had was delicious albeit a little strange since it was basil and white chocolate flavored.Their almond croissant is tougher and less sweet than the like from, La Gourmandine, but still good.

Overall, I'm not sure it's quite as good as La Gourmandine or Jean-Marc Chatellier's, but it's definitely in a more convenient location for me, and to be fair, it's trying to fill a slightly different niche than the other ones. It's also brand-new, so they may have some kinks to iron out. It's a great addition to Squirrel Hill -- check it out today!"}
{"text":"Gaby Et Jules is where magic happens. The hubster and I have been major fans of Gaby Et Jules for years now but this Valentine's Day we are now forever in love with this establishment. Any trip to Squirrel Hill will and always does now include a stop into the bakery to get macaroons. 

I ordered a set of 18 macaroons in a heart shaped box to be sent to my sweet as a loving Valentine's Day surprise. The delivery was your standard 2 day priority mail but sadly USPS botched my present and the cookies arrived damaged, chipped and banged up. I BLAME USPS! 

I then emailed Gaby Et Jules in within hours received a reply back that a replacement order would be shipped at no extra charge. To my great surprise a second order was then hand delivered to my boyfriend's job the next day. I repeat hand delivered.  I ask you \"where they do that at\"? and on top of that a couple weeks later my boyfriend made me aware that he also got a personal phone call from Gaby Et Jules inquiring about his satisfaction with the macaroons.

I feel so valued and just amazing so much so that I sent a personal hand written thank card to expression my appreciation."}
{"text":"Gaby et Jules was definitely a treat. As others have stated the macaroons are delicious and very creative. They are worth 4 stars on their own. I enjoyed them all. The Easter chocolates were beautiful to  look at, but not as good as their macaroons. Also, as others have stated, the price seems a bit much at $2.50 each. Perhaps worth it for a special occasion, but definitely not a frequent indulgence."}
{"text":"Gaby Et Jules have the most impeccable pastries in Pittsburgh. However I think it's too sweet for me. I miss some delicacy in the flavor.
The customer service is very good and if you're looking for great macaroons, definitely this is the best place in the city. There are great variety of flavors and their consistency"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but their macarons are the best! They have a lot of great options. I had a hard time choosing what I wanted and the lady working there was very patient. She took the time to help me decide what to get based on other things I like. I appreciate the good service!"}
{"text":"Best macarons in Pittsburgh. Actually best macarons I've tried so far in the whole country."}
{"text":"I am an avid connoisseur of macarons, and these are some of the best that I've had. I don't like in Pittsburgh but this is a \"must stop\" place when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"They apparently listen to the \"people\" cause when I went yesterday, the macarons are $2.25 a piece, 7 for $15.  I would agree though that they are not as tasty as they are beautiful.  They are perfectly crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Some flavors were very strong (which I mean in a good way - lemon for instance), some were pretty weak and I couldn't really tell what I was eating (raspberry which was a big shock.  J said the vanilla was too sweet as well.  

I would likely return to taste the pastries which were beautiful to behold.  I just hope that they pack a bit more taste then the other beautifully done macarons."}
{"text":"My coworker brought a box of these magical treats in one day to work. WOW. I had the lavender, a coffee one, a lime one, a coconut one and a pink colored one. They were all so different and so delicious. Flaky tops, creamy and sugary in the middle.. to die for. Now I am not a macaroon connoisseur but man oh man were they good! I can't wait to visit the bakery and buy a box for the next friend or family get together!"}
{"text":"I had never known a macaron from a macaroon. Now I know, and I am well-pleased. Excellent product."}
{"text":"If you like tastey desserts you need to come here absolutely amazing. Macaroons and other specialties. A bit pricey but so good."}
{"text":"We have had things from this place many times, but this place never really caught my taste buds. To be honest, all their cakes with a creme taste the same. their macarons look good, but they're really sweet.
Im not a fan. La Gourmandine is x1000 better and Jean-Marc is x900 better"}
{"text":"I go here probably two to five times a month and I love it every time. My boyfriend lives two blocks down so pretty much everytime we are on a walk I make him stop for at least a macaron. So I have probably tried 50% of the desserts and 25% of the macarons. My favorites are the pistachio, cappuccino, and nutella macarons. I really like the opera cake and the Paris-brest desserts. If you are in squirrel hill you must stop by its so delicious."}
{"text":"Truly artisan sweets! The chocolate eggs they make for Easter are so beautiful I can't imagine anyone ever eating one! They have a great assortment of macarons. I sampled the almond, coffee, raspberry, salted caramel, lavender, white chocolate basil, and poppy. I didn't really care for the white chocolate basil...the basil reminded me too much of Italian seasoning. The almond was delicious. The cookie shell was speckled with yummy almond pieces. My absolute favorite was the poppy, which is the April flavor of the month. It had a strong berry taste and I wish I had purchased more than one. The only downside here is the price, which is expected for macarons. $15 for 7 cookies makes them more of an occasional splurge than a regular treat, but maybe that's the way it should be!"}
{"text":"Perfect for gifts of treating yourself once in awhile! Everything there is made with so much care and it shows in the quality of the pastries! I've only tried a handful of the macaron flavors but all have been great and tasty so far. The white chocolate basil is my favorite, with the rose at a close second :) They typically also have a monthly flavor that is fun and new. The small pastries and cakes they offer are also beautifully decorated and extremely tasty. Got a white chocolate pear cake for my birthday a few months back and I almost felt bad digging in because of how perfect it looked! 

One of the best things is taking someone from out of town here for the first time and seeing their face light up with the \"wow\" factor as soon as they walk in. Also gives me an excuse to splurge on a big box of macarons!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night after dinner in shady side. We were greeted with a warm \"Bon jour\" and the smell of delirious pastries.
The store is beautiful and the girls working there were both friendly and knowledgable.
After \"window shopping\" we went nuts! We order one of each of the macaroons and brought them home and cut them into 4's so we each could try
First one was the chocolate and basil.... I wish I bought more!!!"}
{"text":"Gaby Ate Jules was the title of a movie I once saw on the internet. I can't give you the link because children may be watching. However, this is not that.

It's a really lovely little clean shiny modern French bakery full of treats, with absolutely lovely service from girls that are genuinely obsessed with their own products and excited about them. The Macarons were good, and probably would have earned 5 stars if they were normally priced, but at $3 a pop, I couldn't possibly give them higher than a 4. I've had much better incarnations of them which are invariably cheaper. Not to mention that Pittsburgh is a cheap-to-mid-price city, and even New York City bakeries (except some of the more posh ones) don't charge this much for a single Macaron.

Still, the products score 5 despite the high prices. Now would you like to see my family Jules."}
{"text":"Truly divine!  I am going to treat myself to one of these pastries each month, a different one for each month.  The Pittsburgh-Paris just melted in my mouth!  Oh la la.  I cannot recommend Gaby & Jules enough.  Superb."}
{"text":"Great pastries! We got the le royal chocolat and it was really really good! I'm not a fan of Donout and super sweet cakes, this one has the right about of dark chocolate moose and not at all sweet! More like French rather than American-french!"}
{"text":"Gaby et Jules, why have I put off coming here for so long?  The day I moved to Squirrel Hill, about a year and a half ago, I met the owners.  They were out on the corner of Shady and Forbes giving away free macarons.  This was my first experience with a macaron I actually enjoyed.  Most people seem to like them sickly sweet, and I prefer a light flavor.  It may have taken me some time to come back, but I will make up for it now.

My dad and I had lunch at Pizza Bellino, and we wanted dessert.  Usually, we just go to Commonplace for a coffee, but we decided to test Gaby et Jules out.  I started with a sample of the Le Sensation, which was lemon cream and white chocolate mousse on top of lemon-almond dacquoise.  I really enjoyed it and would consider ordering it in the future.  However, we ordered the Royal Chocolat ($5.90) and the Tartelette aux framboises ($5.50).  The Royal Chocolat contained chocolate genoise, chocolate mousse, chocolate miroir glaze, and a gold leaf.  It is basically like eating whipped dark chocolate covered in liquid dark chocolate.  There was a dark chocolate square with gold decorations on the end as well.  It was awesome.  The Tartelette was a huge number of raspberries on top of a pastry cream.  There was a Gaby et Jules logo on top made out of white chocolate, which was amazing.

While I was waiting for my order, I watched the pastry chefs in the back work on the desserts, which was super cool.  While there is no seating inside, they do have two outdoor tables and were happy to supply me with napkins and utensils.

As to the people who prefer La Gourmandine, I am in the opposite camp.  I have always found Gourmandine's goods to be dry and stale.  I also think the price point for the goods here is better than Gourmandine, despite being about double.  The desserts here are so much more beautiful, larger, and fresh in my experience.  I would rather get dessert half the time and come here than go to the competitors and not enjoy my dessert as much.

While the price tag is steep, Gaby et Jules is a great treat to honor a special event or occasion."}
{"text":"The macarons are every bit as good as Laduree. The desserts (I've had the Chocolat Royal and L'Opera and a couple others) are all completely delicious and works of art in their own right. Yes, $6 for a small dessert seems pricey, but each of these would be a $10-12 dessert in a restaurant and probably of lesser quality. The almond croissants are the best I've had in Pittsburgh and the pain au chocolat are fantastic too. Have not tried their baguettes but intend to soon."}
{"text":"I went to Gaby et Jules on the day after Thanksgiving because they had a sign in their window: \"BUY 1 GET 1 FREE MACARONS.\" Nothing else on the sign. I went in and picked out 6 macarons, expecting to pay for 3. When I was rung up, the server quoted me $13 and change. I asked why it was so much and only then did she tell me that the sale was only valid if I bought 12 macarons and got 12 for free. When I asked if it was too late to cancel the transaction, she told me I could either pick 18 more or pay full price for the 6 macarons. I didn't want 24 macarons, so I paid full price for the 6. If the sale was only on dozens of macarons, the sign in the window should say so! This is unethical. I'm sure the macarons will be tasty but that will not fix the bad taste in my mouth from this deceptive and frustrating experience."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite bakery ever! I have a serious sweet tooth and have sampled pastries far and wide. This is definitely one of the best french bakeries (though quite pricey) in town. I usually go in after getting a latte from Commonplace next door. Their macaroons, dark chocolate hazelnut pastry and seasonal mango flavored pastry are all to die for. Also, the display is gorgeous and the place is super clean! Definitely a gem in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try Gaby et Jules for awhile, and I finally got around to it this past Sun. afternoon.  The first thing you notice as soon as you walk in is that they have presentation down to a science--all of the pastries are super visually appealing.  Likewise, they have great packaging that dresses up the pastries nicely.  However, all of this comes at a price, since the prices here are at least 2x that of the nearby competition (La Gourmandine, Jean-Marc).

In light of that, you might ask whether the pastries are worth the price differential, esp. in terms of quality.  Unfortunately, my answer to this is no, not really.  The following three items cost me over $25: six macarons, le sensation, and plaisir sucre.  For the macarons, I ordered the following flavors: chocolate, lemon, Pittsburgh, blueberry, cherry, and sugar plum (Dec. special).  While I didn't have the problem that some reviewers had with the flavors being too subtle, the quality didn't match that of Jean-Marc's macarons.  The sensation, which consisted of white chocolate mousse and lemon creme, was light and delicious, and was the most unique pastry of the bunch.  The plaisir sucre consisted of a hazelnut sponge cake covered with chocolate mousse, which was in turn enrobed in chocolate ganache.  Despite all of the chocolate layers, it wasn't as chocolatey or as complex in flavor as I was hoping.

While all of the pastries I purchased here were good, they just didn't match the quality or the pricing of the nearby competition.  If you're looking for sweets that are visually appealing and are willing to pay a premium for that, then you'll surely enjoy Gaby et Jules.  However, if you're budget conscious like me, then I'd suggest looking elsewhere to get your French pastry fix.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"My favorite bakery in Pittsburgh! For something a little bit different from your typical bread/cake-based shop, Gaby et Jules specializes in macarons and beautiful, unique pastries. Though I haven't tried the macarons yet, I plan to do so very soon! Of the pastries I've tried, I haven't been disappointed in any one. Together with the bright, well-decorated interior, a trip to Gaby et Jules distinguishes itself from other outings in the Pittsburgh area. The price is a little bit expensive, but you really get what you pay for. Whenever I have something to celebrate, a lovely dessert from this shop is the first thing that comes to mind and I never regret it."}
{"text":"Their lemon macarons are incredible. The tartlets are divine. 
Arrays of delectables, all colorful shine. 
I will continue to pine. 
A sweetness so fine."}
{"text":"Nice little shop in Squirrel Hill. The macarons here are really good quality. Nice texture and good amount of flavor. They had a decent selection of flavors as well. I had the pistachio, almond, earl grey, strawberry, mango, and poppy. The flavors were were really pronounced, unlike a lot of other macarons I've had elsewhere where they don't really taste like anything. My favorites were the pistachio and almond. My least favorite were the earl grey (flavor was accurate, just not big on tea) and poppy (tasted like the jelly out of a jelly donut... ick). 

One thing though is that these are really pricy. Probably the most expensive macarons I've had yet, but they were worth it for the most part.

Also, the amount of reviews calling these things macaroons makes my head hurt. There is a difference between macaroons and macarons, people."}
{"text":"A macaronery that's at least as good as Ladurée. Gaby et Jules is a gem. I should note that their puff pastry is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place out today and I couldn't be happier! The atmosphere of the store in general is very clean and pretty with all the colors of the pastries and macarons. We got a box of 12 macarons and they're already half gone. I have a weakness for pretty packaging and food and I got just that. I can't wait until my next visit!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to get in here for awhile and I was not disappointed! The shop is lovely with a window into the kitchen so you can see the chefs at work, and the displays of pastries and macaroons are really inviting!

I got a plain croissant and a little chocolate mousse cake. The croissant was nothing special-- good enough, but not any better than anywhere else. The cake however was delicious! Perfectly creamy and not overly sweet. It was just the right size to split between two or even three people if you come with friends. 

I'll definitely be back in the future and I look forward to trying out more of their selection. The staff were also friendly and though there were several people in the store, I only had to wait a minute before being helped."}
{"text":"The Macarons are just like you find in Paris.  I have a new favorite French Pastry Shop!  And somewhere to bring my French friends when they visit.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Authentic Parisian patisserie? Can't say for sure. But Gaby et Jules certainly wouldn't be out of place if it were transported to Manhattan. Overall, I feel mixed about this shop. On the plus side, the food tastes pretty good and looks beautiful. On the down side, the shop is rather pretentious, and, arguably, overpriced.

I braved the line on its soft opening this past Friday and got: one croissant, one dessert, and four macarons. The croissant was very nice -- flaky, buttery, not doughy at all. It is, however, Americanized  in its size: probably twice as large as the breakfast croissants in France. Gaby et Jules offers an amazing array of jewel-like macarons. Although I have not been fanatic about this confection, G&J's alluring display still got me to try some. And they are very very good. Not too sweet, and the favors generally shine through -- if it's a coffee flavored one, expect strong espresso; if it's raspberry flavored, expect intense summer berry.

While the pastries at G&J may be easy on the eyes, they are not so easy on the wallet. A croissant is $3, the dessert is about $7, and each tiny macaron is $2. One can get similarly tasty treats at Jean Marc Chatellier's for half the price (G&J's macarons are probably a little more sophisticated, but JMC's food has an authentic rustic charm). To me, the main differences are: JMC's Millevale storefront is a great deal humbler; the shop is much harder to get to; their servers, while friendly, are not cute girls who speak with a charming French accent, and your pastries won't be as prettily packaged."}
{"text":"Very contemporary looking shop. They love red!

Open kitchen? Doesn't matter to me. The product is all that counts.

Not being familiar with French macarons, I purchased two of most everything. My wife and I thought the filling was a bit too sweet; our opinion... not sure if they are supposed to be that sweet.

Comments on Opera and Caramelia: very rich chocolate. Nice looking and tasty... but we like the products more at La Gourmandine on Butler Street. Warmer atmosphere, greater selection (no macarons, but that's ok).

Couple of people have commented on the prices; I agree that the prices are a little high for most of the items... not that we have much to compare them with. 

A problem exists with the location: Forbes Avenue area parking is difficult to find if you just want to pop in for a snack.  Gaby et Jules will benefit from heavy sidewalk traffic, but lose on drive-by traffic. 

Overall, very nice... but there are other choices."}
{"text":"I love macarons but I especially love macarons from Gaby Et Jules. All of the workers speak fluent French and I believe that the owner used to work for Ladurée, which is my all time favorite patisserie."}
{"text":"So I just had one of the best desserts in my life and I want to tell everyone about it!! Luckily that is what Yelp is for :).

The bakery is really cute and clean. Everything is laid out in an organized manner and perfectly labeled with names, descriptions and prices. I have tasted the macaroons from here before. They were good but I don't totally obsess over macaroons so I didn't realize this bakery's full potential.

I was torn between the death by chocolate log (not its real name) and the raspberry mound (also not its real name) and decided on the chocolate log after a long mental battle. I couldn't wait til I got it home so I ate it outside. And... omg!!!!!!!

It was a creamy and fluffy mousse with parts that were crunchy and other parts that seemed to be like chocolate gel. Every bite was perfect and I felt like I was on vacation. The dessert looked perfect and even had a little piece of gold on top. Also the super shiny chocolate frosting(?) made it look super sleek. It was a sexy dessert.

I will now begin to fantasize about every dessert I saw on display today and what they taste like until I return to try them all.
My only issue was the prices of some of the items. (Macaroons I'm looking at YOU)"}
{"text":"What a fantastic little treat shop! Unique to Pittsburgh, this patisserie serves beautifully crafted and delicately flavored French yum-yums. The storefront and interior are well kept and feature an welcoming, attractive modern design. 

I was provided with excellent macaron recommendations and the chocolate pastries were delicious. They had decent croissants and baked goods as well, but the focus here is clearly on the sweets.

Service was very helpful and friendly, which is what takes this from a four to a five star review."}
{"text":"I really don't know why there is so much hate here. Sure this is Pittsburgh, but any decent macaron anywhere else will be at least $3. The disadvantage, I guess, is that maybe there are many college/grad students checking this place out? Even so, you shouldn't be popping these macarons like pills anyway.

The macarons were pretty, like they're supposed to be, but I did think that they lacked in taste. The flavors were there, but not as strong as I wanted them to be.

I fell in love with their chocolate cake, Le Royal Chocolat. Get it!"}
{"text":"The most unique and best tasting macaron I've ever had was a goat cheese macaron from this place. It worked surprisingly well and raised the bar higher than any other macaron has been able to measure up to. I also enjoyed the assortment of desserts they had. It was hard to narrow it down to purchase only four :D"}
{"text":"Good pastries. Very expensive. Excessive packaging.

About the packaging: I told them I'd eat the piece of cake on their table out front, they unfortunately didn't put it on a little paper plate, but put it in a box the same as a to-go order.

I would patronize Gaby et Jules more often if they did not repeatedly overdo the packaging.

Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.

P.S. I recommend Gourmandine bakery in Hazelwood or Lawrenceville as an alternative. Their almond croissants are superb, and they'll serve you on china. Less pretentious, less expensive, and greener."}
{"text":"J'adore Gaby Et Jules macarons. So many different flavors to choose from with such cute packaging. I enjoyed my staple macaron flavors - coffee, salted caramel and pistachio. Great colors (especially the electric green pistachio) and excellent flavoring on the fillings. I thought it was adorable how they had their own unique Pittsburgh macaron - Le Pittsburgh - which was half yellow and half black to represent the Steeler nation. Basically all the flavors I usually get from macaron shops - I liked. Gaby Et Jules bakes their macaron cookie shells to perfection as they are moist with a delicate \"crunch\". I'm using \"crunch\" for lack of a better word because the macarons here do not actually make a \"crunch\" sound as they are pretty soft. It's always a disappointment to receive hollow shelled macarons as they are difficult to make but none of my macarons from here had that problem. I decided to be adventurous and try Earl grey, rose, and vanilla basil and hated all of them. That doesn't take away any stars though because that's more of a preference thing. I'm just meant to like the basics. I thought the rose flavored macaron was too fragrant and I really felt as if I bit into a rose flower. My simpleton tastebuds could not comprehend the combination of vanilla and basil and thought it was too strong of a macaron. The earl grey macaron was gorgeous, however, left a bad taste in my mouth. 

I actually didn't get a chance to stop by this storefront but instead went to the small Gaby Et Jules inside Market Street Grocery. They get their macarons from this main storefront though so I figured it made more sense reviewing the main store as opposed to reviewing Market Street Grocery."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of macaroons, but since my wife is gluten-free we sometimes stop here for a little different option for dessert than the ice cream/froyo places in Squirrel Hill.

The star of this place are the macaroons. They have a variety of at least 20 different flavors, from basics like chocolate to more esoteric like rose. They are all very well made and flavorful. We've never had one that was dry. They always seem to have the right mix of moistness and bite. I tend to stick with the more traditional; my favorites are caramel and lemon.

They are not cheap, however. $2+ per macaroon. You have to be careful as you can easily walk out $30-$40 lighter. 

We haven't really tried any of the other items, but they do have a nice selection of other pastries and baked goods, again all very well presented. 

I think this is a great place to pick something up a little more unique for dessert, but it is definitely not an everyday treat. It's a fun dessert for a group of people to try different flavors."}
{"text":"I tried 6 macaroon flavors and I'll try to remember them all - Lavender, Violet, Pistachio, White Chocolate Basil, Earl Grey and Rose.  Out of those, I enjoyed the Pistachio and Earl Grey the most.  

I've had macroons from Laduree and I can't even compare the two - Laduree is on a completely other (heavenly) level from most of the macroons I've ever tasted.  The ones from Gaby Et Jules were ok, a bit too creamy in the middle for my taste and I didn't always feel that the flavors were true to taste.  For example, I've had amazingly good Rose macaroons before but if I hadn't rememberd I ordered a Rose macroon I would have never guessed that the flavor was Rose.  Same with many of the other flavors including Lavender and Violet.  

I wasn't a huge fan of the White Chocolate Basil but I thought the Pistachio and Earl Grey were 4 star worthy.  6 macrooons will set you back $13.00 - which is on par with other high end pastry places."}
{"text":"This place is legit, and high-end. 

I've had a few of their pastries, but I come regularly for a simple canele. These are a traditional and somewhat curious French sweet snack. It's like an almost overdone, crunchy, caramelized doughy egg custard in a small bite sized form. They're super good in general and always excellent here. 

In addition, their croissants, both the regular and chocolate versions, are 100% legit. 

The last time I had a chocolate croissant this good was, in fact, in France, and while there are a few other French bakeries in Pittsburgh, neither of their chocolate croissants come close. Well, one does, and his shop deserves the respect it's earned over many decades. The other place, however, should stop selling them immediately, since it's ruined their credibility in my mind. 

Not so at Gaby et Jules! The only problem here is how to not stop in every day!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this shop while I was shopping in the Squirrel Hill area. I love going to patisseries, and checking out all the unique desserts they have. I wanted something small, so I bought a couple of the macarons. The pistachio flavored one was good. I could actually taste the flavor of the nut, and the filling was not too sweet. The rose flavored macaron however, was way too sugary. I cringed halfway trying to finish it. A little sugar actually goes a long way people, and if the sugar overwhelms the person...how can they get a taste of the other flavors in the dessert?! I would probably come back to try some of their other desserts, which I didn't get a chance to try. Hopefully it's not just pure sugar mixed in with food dye. I still have hope for you Gaby Et Jules, please don't disappoint!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday afternoon with my fiance for a light snack.  This was actually the second time that we had been here although the first time was close to closing time right after they had opened so there was not much to see or buy.  This time around though, man were the display cases decorated with some beautiful food.  Everything about this place feels warm and inviting including the workers who seem to want to help you.  On my recent visit here I ended up ordering an Almond Croissant without really looking at the price.  So you can imagine my surprise whenever it cost me $5.50!  Granted I am more than happy to pay for really good food whenever it necessary and while this was good food, it wasn't great food.  The croissant did have a nice flaky texture to it and a good buttery taste with the outside  covered in sliced almonds. However,I would have been much happier going to another Pittsburgh's French bakeries and getting a superior almond croissant for half the price.  The previous time that I was here my fiance and I got 3 macaroons to split.  While I do not remember the flavors, I do remember enjoying them even if they did cost us a little bit each (I think around $2).  So why the 3 star review for food I clearly enjoyed you ask?  Well it certainly isn't for the interior of the shop which was awesome, nor is it for the customer service which I have found to be great on both occasions.  It is strictly based upon the prices and the fact that I can get what I think is a superior item for much cheaper at a couple of places that are not that far away.

The bottom line for me is that I might be back in the future but only if I am in the Squirrel Hill area and really craving something from a French bakery."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I tried the almond croissant and a few of the macaroons. I agree that the macaroons are much creamier than the average macaroon, but they are absolutely delicious. The almond croissant was perfect - a bit of crisp on the outside and delicious almond within. Not too sweet, perfect with a morning coffee."}
{"text":"Awesome treats and wonderful customer service!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I couldn't resist stopping by Gaby Et Jules today while shopping around Squirrel Hill. I was never a macaron lover until I visited the famous Bouchon Bakery in NYC and tasted what a fine work of art the macaron can be.

The sales associate was very friendly, and my husband and I tried a couple tasty samples. We settled on purchasing a half dozen macarons (for $13) and selected lavender, pistachio, white chocolate basil, Le Pittsburgh (which I believe was Bailey's?), and two of the Sea Salt. My two favorite macarons were the Sea Salt - so happy we got two - and the pistachio. Unfortunately, both the lavender and the white chocolate basil macarons were pretty soft and mushy. 

I really wanted to give Gaby Et Jules rave reviews, but after spending over $2 per macaron, I thought that having a couple poorly prepared macarons in the mix just wasn't acceptable."}
{"text":"Sadface. I got to stop in here for a breakfast treat before work one morning. The space is just beautiful. I ordered an almond croissant, which at a whopping $5.50 (!!!) I was expecting to taste like nothing short of heaven. Well sadly the filling was very grainy and not good. My standard for comparison is La Gourmandine and their almond croissants are amazing and not nearly as expensive. I will return and try their other offerings, but with the prices so high, they have a lot to prove!"}
{"text":"Coming from Vegas, I am a confection snob, and French Macarons are in my top 5 favorite things that exist on the planet earth. At Gaby Et Jules, I have tried 14 flavors so far, including earl grey, raspberry, almond, etc...

I find the price of these little treats average. While pricy when compared to similar treats, they are on-par for the pricing of a good macaron.

The flavor profiles are interesting, and most of the time quite good. If there was to be a complaint, it would be that sometimes (in certain macarons) the flavor is quite muted. This is a personal issue, and does not mean that they are not good by any means. 

As for texture & proportion: The outside \"biscuit\" section of the macarons have the proper texture... slightly crunchy shell... and the inside cream filling was found to be a good proportion. The filling is also smooth, light, and silky in texture. As expected, a proper macaron should somewhat melt in your mouth. 

The ambiance of the shop reminds me somewhat of previous french bakeries that I have been in, but perhaps just a bit more \"pretentious\" - perhaps from pride of their product. This didn't bother me at all. I rather expect it."}
{"text":"This a great place for a special date or to take someone from out of town. It's right across the street from Coffee Tree Roasters, which has fantastic coffee. 
The pastries are really good----the macarons are TO DIE FOR and they put your baked goods in cute fancy boxes. The service was great, and the place is pretty sophisticated. I'd give it 4 stars---maybe even five, but for $2.25 a pop for a tiny cookie I'll leave it at 3."}
{"text":"The first time I had macarons was at Ladurée in New York. I didn't know what to expect. Here in my hand was a beautiful cookie that I could eat in two bites, and I paid 2.50 for it. Five bites later, I was amazed. It had a crisp and fragile outer shell. Then soft and chewy with some kind of filling. I was surprised more by the texture than the taste. Since then, I have eaten macarons as often as possible. 

So what I'm getting to is that Gaby Et Jules makes the most fantabulous macarons I have tried yet. I got Rose, Pistachio, Peach Violet, Lemon, Lavender and Earl Grey. The Peach Violet was my favorite. They were bursting with flavor, and yet not too sweet. And this is coming from a person who can hardly eat anything with sugar in it without calling it too sweet. And they Nailed the texture. It was perfect. Pro tip: (I'm not a macaron eating pro, I just like to act like I am.) To get the right texture, eat 'em chilled. We got our box of 6, and then walked around in the smoldering remains of Squirrel Hill for only a brief moment before trying them. Still delightful but slightly soggy. The rest were consumed after being in an air conditioned car for awhile. That's when they were perfect. 

There were other pastries sitting on the marble countertops. At least I think they were pastries. They looked like they were made of ceramic, or plastic, or Crisco. Looked like some kind of art display. So I was afraid to eat any of those because you know what they say, \"You are what you eat.\" (Don't they say that?) I was afraid if I ate one of those, some art shaped cocoon would suddenly be spun about me and I would be whisked away and hung on a wall. I actually wanted to eat everything. Ya, I think I should go back and eat some of those other pastries."}
{"text":"French baked goods is a special vice of mine. So anything after this will be biased.

These little overpriced french cookies are just delightful.  Several different flavors which may or may not be worth trying.  I've experimented with their white chocolate basil and earl grey and I have to say they weren't bad.  

Will come again. and again. and again...."}
{"text":"Yummy macarons!!! We tried...

White chocolate basil x2: VERY basil, caught me off guard
Le Pittsburgh x2: this is just whatever to me, I didn't really care for it 
Raspberry: delicious
Rose: good
Pistachio 
Earl grey tea: tastes like fruity pebbles at first, it's good and I see it being a favorite, but I personally don't care for it
Salted caramel: sooooo good. My fave flavor!!!
Nougatine: an almond-y, creamier version of salted caramel. A touch sweeter than the salted caramel. 
Lemon: my second fave!! Glad the girl working told me to try it 
Coffee

Ahh I loved reading the story on how gaby et juls came to be (there's a newspaper article on the wall that made me curious, so I checked out their website). Yummy macarons and friendly service. I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"French pastries just make one feel extra fancy, right?  Biting into a macarons with flavors such as salted caramel, raspberry, lemon, and earl gray while eyes closed makes you feel like you've been transported to the streets of Paris.  When you open your eyes, you're slightly disappointed, but can indulge in another treat.

Walking in, I'll be honest - I expected more... after all this is a French pastry shop.  The decor was a bit minimal, but the color of the macarons brightened things up.

I stopped in to grab dessert for myself and friends.  There was an assortment of pastries in front of me.  I asked for their preferences - the raspberry and lemon tarts were recommended.  How could I say no?  Along with the tarts, I took home 6 macarons.  The price was $27 - a bit high if I do say so.

When it came time to sample the tarts, a creamy vanilla custard was topped with fresh raspberries.  It wasn't overly sweet, but bright yet creamy.  Simply delicious.  Unfortunately the lemon tart was less desirable.  If I wanted something that tart, I would have bit straight into a lemon.  Though topped with meringue, it didn't have enough sweet or creamy to counteract that lemon flavor.

Perhaps I'll stop in again for macarons or another delicacy.  I'll partake in anything... but lemon."}
{"text":"This was a solid place! I'm not much of a sweets person, so I didn't try all of the pastries that were offered. All I really wanted to try was a croissant and a macaroon. It was recommended that I try the sea salt caramel macaroon and it didn't disappoint! If it were only for that, I'd give this place 5 stars. 

The croissant, however, was freaking boring. And dry. And without enough awesome butter flavor. I've legit had better at one of the crepe places around town. I was severely disappointed because they looked fantastic, but the flavor totally missed the mark for me. 

If I needed to get something fancy to impress someone, I'd certainly stop in again! Oh, and thanks to the cashier who kindly spoke elementary French with me while I fawned over the dessert case. Merci, beaucoup!"}
{"text":"You don't need to be pretentious.  The quality of the  food sells itself.

I would give the quality of the pastries here a solid 4.  I got one of each of the four on display. and a baguette.  Total was $30 which is fine for the quality of the selected items.    I didn't understand that gimmick where the staff spoke French at all.

Overall the pastries are very good. The baguette was also good.  Maybe I am a little to rough and tumble for this place."}
{"text":"Gaby Et Jules is exactly what one should expect of a good French bakery!  The atmosphere is spot on.  Clean, small, lovely, and you can see the full kitchen and chefs baking away behind glass.  It's just wonderful. Onto the desserts...

DIVINE!  I purchased an assortment of delicacies for my holiday party, from macarons to tiny tarts and pufed pastries.  Everything was delish and decorated beautifully.  

My only critique is the price.  Yes, the items are specialty, but $3+ per macaron (unless you buy in bulk, b/c the price does go down) is a bit steep. $7 avg. per pastry?  I mean, this is still Pittsburgh.  These prices rival NYC.  Macarons are such a fad dessert right now that people forget that they aren't incredibly difficult to make, and the ingredients are pretty inexpensive.  That being said, they were very good... just overpriced in my opinion.

Overall, c'est magnifique! (I couldn't resist.)"}
{"text":"Every holiday and then some I get a sweet treat or two... or three.
Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"OMGoodness!!!  How did I not know this place existed???  It is Macaron heaven!!!  SO many flavors to choose from. And that's just the beginning!  They have so many petite works of art that are edible. They also have croissants and breads. I'm drooling over every bit of it. It is all beautiful to look at and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"This place is a pastry wonderland! I was so overwhelmed by the colors and flavor combinations of the macarons. They were beautifully displayed in the window and behind the counter. It was all just so appealing to the eye...but that's not why you're reading my review. You want to know about the taste! Well, I'll tell you...

This was my first time indulging in a macaron. I had read about this place from a girl I follow on Instagram who said, and I quote, \"Best macarons in Pittsburgh!\" Since we were headed out that way, I had to try some! Obviously, being that it was my first macaron experience, I have nothing to compare these beauties to. However, I can say with absolute certainty that they were delicious! There were so many wonderful flavors to choose from! Chocolate, vanilla bean, raspberry, lemon, earl grey, salted caramel....rest assured, I tried them all. I knew walking in here that I was in trouble. I was right, I ate all six in a day and a half. I am not ashamed..."}
{"text":"The macaroons are certainly pricey, yet I found them well worth the price. Jules offers about three dozens variations of macaroons as well as several other pastries and French baguettes. 

I've only had the macaroons which I found to be delicious wonderful. The flavors are quite intricate. The sugar is not overwhelming, so you are able to taste the subtitles in the difference of flavors; however, some flavors are quite delicate. I would recommend thoroughly cleansing your palate before trying a different flavor. 

I tried orangette, rose, pistachio, almond, passion fruit-chocolate, a honey nut blend, and violet. My favorites were orangette and pistachio, but I would recommend all of the flavors I tried! I intend to upgrade Gaby et Jules to four and a half stars if I am ever permitted to do so."}
{"text":"Got to tell you I was not impressed with this place. We stopped in unplanned while walking back to our car after lunching up the block. A fine, small dessert sounded great so we went in. There were many choices and it looked like they were set up for takeout and for large orders for holiday parties.  

So we got two items to go for over $9.  That seemed steep but I was in a splurging mood.  The ordering process seemed awkward and left me feeling uneasy.  The item I ordered comes in a small plastic cup similar to a shot glass.  It had a crumb topping.  It was placed in a box meant for macarons and didn't quite fit.  By the time I got it home those crumbs spilled out.  Now, why sell something to go with no way of transporting it? I would have eaten it on the way to the car if a spoon was offered. 

And for the taste? Just so-so."}
{"text":"so my husband and I stopped by after a meal down the street. I had seen it preparing to open and wanted to try it out. I love pastries and was so excited to have a  Patisseries nearby. 

So, we picked up the tart au citron and a tart framboise as well as two macaroons. Overall they were good - albeit a little pricier than I would have expected - $15. The flavors were good but not \"oh my god this is amazing!\". I'd go back but go out of my way to head back. 

Honestly, I prefer La Gourmandine in Lawrenceville much more - their lemon tart makes me swoon."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for macarons. They have SO many different flavors & they're always getting new ones. They also have little cakes & other pastries. The baked goods here are true works of art & you can tell that they are made with patience & care. It's very easy for me to spend all of my money here because I want to taste everything they have every time I go in."}
{"text":"A 4.5-star from a person who almost never eat sweet things. Guess how good their pastries are."}
{"text":"I always come here for the macarons. Their macarons are not bad, a little dry, but I hate how they seem to spam your email with promotions when you give it to them for like a receipt to be sent to you email."}
{"text":"The best bakery in Pittsburgh, hands down. I have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. Macarons are to die for - my favorites are Raspberry & Salted Caramel. I have also tried the majority of their pastries and almost every one was flawless. I always get the Meteor when it's available. The prices are steep, but I promise it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Decent macarons served by two truculent & sour faced girls in an otherwise empty shop. No wonder. I wouldn't ever go back when there are many more polite options on this street. And judging by the empty shop, others feel the same."}
{"text":"I feel so guilty eating their desserts because they are just so BEAUTIFUL! But I quickly overcome that guilt because they are equally delicious. I admit, I do take photographs of the dishes I order when I go out occasionally, but it becomes a complete abomination to not photograph these desserts before eating them because they are so beautiful! I really enjoy the complexities of the desserts too - each dessert that I have had here is magnificent in texture, flavor and complexity. You really can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"La Jalousie is the most interesting dessert I've ever tried. Le Succes is densely chocolate, but delicious. And the poppy macarons were surprisingly fruity and tasty.

Basically, a really solid French bakery at expected prices."}
{"text":"You know how the storefront is all shiny red and silver and glamorous?  Well, the inside of this bakery is just as shiny and glamorous...and so are all the pastries.  The pastry chef must also be a pastry artist, because every item is beautifully and intricately decorated and super fancypants.

Yes, it's true, their macarons are delicious.  If you happen to pop in while they have the pumpkin macaron, make sure you try it.  It's absolutely out of this world.  I like their macarons better than Jean-Marc Chatellier's.  And yes, it's true, they will also cost you a pretty penny.  But if you are as much of a macaron enthusiast as I am, Gaby et Jules is worth the trek.

That said, I have tried one other thing here -- a pain au chocolat -- and it was much more expensive than La Gourmandine's and not as good.  Actually, I have a hard time imagining how some of their pastries could be better than the same pastries at La Gourmandine, and they are consistently at least 50% more expensive here.  So, although I have yet to give a few other \"benchmark\" items a try (I have heard that their baguettes are magnificent), I probably would not recommend getting your other pastries here unless you live in Squirrel Hill or you have a generous dessert budget."}
{"text":"I could eat these macarons for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and every single snack in between! Such a cute little shop. The French baguettes are also super delicious. The dough is shipped from France and baked in the shop. They always have new and interesting flavors!

The macarons and bread get five stars from me no doubt about it! 

The reason this review lacks the fifth star is because I am constantly frustrated when I want to buy many macarons and pay pretty much full price for even buying them in bulk. I think it would be totally awesome if they would offer a discount for buying in greater quantities! $2.25 per macaron is not bad, but the size of French macarons is not exactly satisfying! Any time I go I basically want to eat 15 of them and definitely not share. 


Overall, this place is awesome! Love it!"}
{"text":"Gaby et Jules,  Je taime!  How can I describe the majesty of a perfectly made macaron...  I don't know, but I will try.  
First off, I am not a sweets person.  I would rather have an extra piece of meat or bread at the end of a meal, instead of dessert.  That being said, I had the honor and privilege of tasting one of Gaby et Jules macarons at a food event and they were FABULOUS!  

After that tasting, my daughter, (Nicknamed Muff) begged me to take her to the actual patisserie in Squirrel Hill.  Indulgent mother that I am, we set our sights on the jewelry cases containing some of the finest macarons to be had in the country!  Yes, I said country!  I've had macarons at places said to be \"famous\" for their macarons and the macarons at Gaby et Jules outshone them by a long shot.  

For someone who isn't into sweets to actually say that they dream of salty carmel or lovely raspberry macarons, is to say a lot!  To eat a whisp of flavored air and have it envelope your tongue in ethereal loveliness... Ah, what glory they are!  I can't wait to go back for more..."}
{"text":"I used to think that I didn't like Macaroons. They looked hard and super sweet and so I turned my nose up without ever giving them a try. On a recent trip to Paris (my first ever) I made the adventure to try Macaroons. It seemed like the thing to do. I loved them. They were soft, moist, and a lovely balance of even flavor throughout the pastry. 

After having Macaroons in France, I was sure nothing could compare. Not even the highly coveted Gaby et Jules. Again, I was wrong. 

A six pack comes at a hefty price, but in my humble opinion these Macaroons are just as good as the ones I ate in Paris. You don't get a view of the Arc de Triomphe from the Squirrel Hill shop, but your tastebuds won't know the difference."}
{"text":"I was given free samples during the Diner en Blanc Pittsburgh event last week and was left speechless. They were moist, delicate and simply delicious. Going to make a trip to squirrel hill for a box!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing!  The staff is polite, efficient, and helpful, the decoration is gourmet, the kitchen staff is visible, and the patisseries and macarons are the best we've ever had.  They also do a croissant (sold out when we went) and a simple baguette which was also the best baguette ever!  It is such a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  It compliments other businesses on the street.  This Saturday, we stopped first for a baguette and macarons, my wife got Tea from Margret's Tea, Pikolino shoes from Littles, John Varvatos shirt from Charles Spiegel, a Mayoral outift and Djeco puzzle from Kidz and Company, and some new Wusthof knives from Contemporary Concepts.  Gaby et Jules completed our faux vacation to Squirrel Hill, which felt like a trip to Europe!  Make sure to try the Basil Chocolate Macaron, sounds odd, but tastes AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The macarons were delicious; the texture was great, and the flavors were subtle and pure. I had a lemon and a a raspberry. 

The only reason it doesn't get five stars is the price. I don't know what the deal is, but they're a little small for the price."}
{"text":"Gaby et Jules have the best macarons! They have a very large selection of flavors to choose from. I planned my Sunday morning brunch in Squirrel Hill just to be able to stop in to pick up a box of their macarons. After a nice small brunch, I decided to walk over to Gaby et Jules and pick up a box of 12. Needless to say, I was not disappointed! You can't go wrong with any of their flavors! 

I would highly recommend Gaby et Jules and will definitely be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"Beautiful store, impeccably clean and service is warm and accommodating (over the phone and also in person). 

Gaby Et Jules' macarons are delicious and perfectly shaped; shows true talent by the chef I think. I tried:
coffee
earl grey 
lemon
lavendar
rose
pistacio

Fillings are very delicious, and they're pretty sweet so while they're expensive, as dessert you probably would only have 2 max at a time (I think at least). Would be great with an indulgent tea with the girls. Best eaten same day I think, but you can refrigerate as they say and let it come back to room temp before you eat. It's not quite as snappy/crispy the next day, but it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pastries!   I went today for the second time and was not disappointed.   The desserts are beautiful and some look like a blown glass sculpture.  The rainbow array of macarons was beautifully arranged with inventive flavors.  (The coffee is my favorite).   Everybody was so very friendly and attentive.  Already thinking of when I can come back..."}
{"text":"Let us remove the most obvious out of the way, shall we?  Yes, the price tag is high versus going to say a Dunkin Donuts or your local coffee shop for ho-hum sweet stuff.  Gaby et Jules dishes out high quality desserts with ornate decorations that could double as works of art.  I visited Pittsburgh for a week and dropped in at least three times to sample several of their treasures.

First of all, none of these desserts should be transported and left in a hot car or left unrefrigerated.  The creme, gels, and filllings will melt down and you'll be sad to have spent your hard earned dollars on a small colorful puddle; treat them as though they are ice cream servings.  The macarons can keep longer but they too should be eaten when cool to experience the outer shell crunch and soft, inner layer of subtle flavors.

So, my selections consisted of:

1) Le Croustillant Aux 3 Chocolats - basically a combination of three different chocolates that are smooth like mousse with hints of hazelnut, and less sweet than your average chocolate milk.  Unbelievably delicious.

2) La Jolousie - soft texture, perfect blend of Bavarian creme, strawberry gel, mint panna cotta layered on a Madeleine crust with a touch of almond.  Dessert wet dream has just occurred!! 

3) Bavarois - at first glance, a red velvet cake?  Nope, the fruit custard top and what I imagine is close to an airy pound cake as its base.  Good, but not my favorite.

4) Apricot and panna cotta swirl cup - not the actual name but it describes exactly what it is.  An apricot gelee and panna cotta mix never gets too sweet and hits a home run for me on the third visit.  The plastic spoon easy breaks through the layers and the two flavors are an ideal match.  It is so light that even when you are too full for dessert, it will still fit in your belly.

If you got the extra few bucks to spare and want perfection, look no further."}
{"text":"After watching a baking challenge on TV, we were craving macaroons. We were passing through today and decided to stop. 

The woman working was knowledgeable, friendly and extremely patient. 

I purchased a chocolate croissant which is life changing. It is flaky, buttery and not too sweet. We also got 6 macaroons which are delicate and so flavorful. 

I am so thankful that we stopped and look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"Yes, the desserts are incredible and the quality is spot on. The selection is a bit limited, from what i see. 
The downside is the prices are right up there with a bakery in New York or San Francisco. This is Pittsburgh....i am not sure a place like this will last here. Good luck"}
{"text":"Savory macaroons - Delish. Try the goat cheese ones. Nice treat for long afternoon of studying. The sweet ones are terrific also - v sweet, but that's why you go with a friend to a few different ones to taste test like an aficionado. Tres magnifique!"}
{"text":"Ascetically, it's very pleasing. The nice clean lines found outside are repeated inside this French bakery. I love the red and silver exterior, it gives a modern look to the main drag of Forbes Ave in Squirrel Hill. 
All the white glove wearing 'Gaby Girls and Guys' were very friendly, greeting us with a pleasant 'Bonjour!' and smiling brightly while ringing up our $80 (!$!$!) worth of macarons and a pastry. 
The macarons are brightly colored yet subtly flavored. Some flavors are better than others. The sea salt caramel was a little disappointing, but the white chocolate basil, almond, and rose were perfect.
And yes, they do tip the scales at $2.25 for 1 with no discounts when you buy more. 
You pay for high quality, which is expected.
It was good to try once, and perhaps on a very special occasion, but Gaby et Jules is a little too pricey for me to become a regular."}
{"text":"Lovely little French bakery. What is it with me and French bakeries lately? Holy moly. My mum loves this place first and foremost for their macarons, it seems, but also for their pastries. Specifically those cute little cakes with the big price tags. We were just bitching about the prices earlier and then proceeded to spend about 50 clams on deliciousness. Oh well. I guess a lot of effort goes into making some of this stuff. I can understand charging a lot for macarons because I have made them before myself and yes, it's a huge PIA. lol. Oft times they don't come out right. Baking is truly a science. I am glad this place has a formula for kick-ass macarons down-pat. 

Oh and the service--I have only been in once--but let me tell you, sweetest ladies working behind the counter. I love the accents and the French words and how they encourage us to attempt to pronounce words. Heehee. I am soooo bad at French. Every French person ever (particularly the linguists and teachers) are rolling in their graves every time I attempt to pronounce various words... oh well! But yeah, they were running low on macarons and were out of some flavors but when we asked, they went in the back to procure more. They are closed on Mondays and I was hellbent to try some of their delicacies. It was, of course, nearing 3:00pm today (Sunday) and that's when they close. Still, great service despite this. A+

Hard to say what things are my favorites... I know I did not like the banana cake thing but that's because I am not fond of banana to the extent that some people are... also their orange tart thingy was too orange-y for me. But if you like a certain flavor and you get a \"that\" flavor item, chances are, you will like it. A lot. E.g. I looove hazelnut and their hazelnut cake/torte/thing was FANTASTIC. Soooo good. And the pistachio cake? I devoured the entire thing in a minute. Agggh!

I had to pop a digestive enzyme after eating this rich amazingness but was totally worth any indigestion that may occur after.... their lemon macarons and the chocolate ones are my fave. Basil was freakin' delish as well as the Earl Grey macaron. How do they get such intense flavors all in one little cookie? IDK! And I wish so hard they were open Mondays as I am flying back to St. Louis tomorrow evening and they normally open quite early...I'd totally haul ass back there first thing tomorrow morning if I could and stock up for the flight home. Unffff. I guess I will have to wait until my next trip back to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I tried the Lemon Tart and the Pear Cheesecake.All I have to day for both is, it was dangerously delicious and taste like your eating pastry from a true chef! the crumb bottom of both was crumby enough, the tart had just the right amount of tart and the cheesecake was nothing  but creamy awesomeness. This place is pricey but I PROMISE, you will not regret trying any of the pastries.

I also had some Macarons and although the texture was executed well, the flavors missed the mark as they were very faint.
 
Macaron flavors I tried:

Raspberry 
Pistachio 
Almond 
Poopy 
Nougatine 
Passion fruit
White Basil
Pineapple

Raspberry and Pineapple were the only flavors I could taste (slightly). Service was service. Young lady serving us looked snobbish and as if she needed a Pepsi to wake her up (I hate soda/Pepsi by the way)"}
{"text":"While this little French patisseries is not a place I visit often, each time I go I wonder \"why not?\"  Today's visit was for the free macaron in honor of Free Macaron Day.  While waiting in line, you can watch the pastry chefs at work in the back, and its a truly unique experience.  The sample of the day was the pecan pie macaron and it did not disappoint. The other pastries are so perfect and beautiful they almost look fake.  True works of art and delicious.  The desserts here taste regal, not heavy. After trying to narrow down my selection, I chose the Creamy Pear Cheesecake it was so very good.  Light, sweet, but not too sweet, and the poached pear inside the gorgeous dome was unique.  If you are like me and need that \"little something sweet\" each day, and you happen to be passing by Gaby Et Jules, it's definitely worth going inside!  The pastries are a little pricey...my pear cheesecake was around $6, but again, the experience of this little shop reminds me that \"you get what you pay for.\"  Grab a pastry or a macaron (or six) and experience a little bit of Paris in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The macaroons here are delicious and beautiful. Most of them have delightful, subtle flavors that almost melt in your mouth, but some of them are either very bland (vanilla, coffee) or really strong (rose, lemon).

Still...watch yourself... At over $2 each, your purchase will set you back. Since my palette is not always in such a \"sophisticated\" state, Trader Joe's macaroons at less than 1/6th of the price are usually just fine for me. 

The staff is very professional and friendly. We met one of the chefs once, and he was adorable--clearly very dedicated to his craft."}
{"text":"The place is different, fancy desserts a bit pricey, though.  I got some macroons they were good but I've had better at Jean's in millvale."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Pittsburgh to get a macaron! A cute store with a ton of different options to try. I have been wanting to try one of their desserts but I always end up getting some macarons instead. I  have tried a variety of their flavors with my favorites being almond, pistachio, hazelnut, and raspberry. The nutty ones are perfect and not too sweet. The only bad one I ever had was the easter edition one. It looked like a duck but the banana flavor was terrible. They are expensive, but totally worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"Bonjour! Permettez-moi de vous aider à vider votre portefeuille aujourd'hui!

Few pastries excite me as much as the ones at Gaby Et Jules patisserie.  I stopped by on a recent Friday afternoon.  The exterior of the shop is an incredible bright spot on Forbes Avenue.  Inside, the store is very clean, bright and tidy.  The display cases are full of carefully placed edibles, lined up like tiny jewels and magnificent works of art.  So elegant!  The shop really is quite over the top.  And I'm not just talking about the prices!

My wonderful Gaby girl patiently waited while I chose my macarons one at a time and carefully boxed them up for me.  Next came my pastry choices.  She was even too kind as to help me decide which to try.  She told me how every pastry is hand crafted in the traditional French way with no shortcuts.  I loved her accent and could have talked to her all day.  I can see that care goes into creating each puffy pastry.  Everything was perfectly packaged in bags and boxes with the super cool and very pretty GEJ insigna.  After many ohs and ahs, I was out the door.  

Later, back at the ranch, it was time to enjoy my super duper indulgences.  The question was, where to start?  And who will help me?

BJ and the macarons won.  They were the right amount of crunchy goodness on the outside.  And the perfect gooey, fluffy, soft sweetness on the inside.  I am a fan of these tiny little pillows of delight-fullness. The little cookies were deliciousness in my mouth, I swear.  And well worth the splurge.  These treats seem to be straight from Heaven.

Later, came the froufrou French patisseries.  Never met a tartelette that I didn't love.  And I loved this one, topped with raspberries.  Another special treat was the Paris-brest.  I am a fan of the hazelnut flavored creme and the choux pastry was topped with powdered sliced almonds.  Another treat is their croissants.  I ordered a pain au chocolat and while they were not the very best that I have ever had, they were very good.  The crust was very flaky and shattered as I torn into it.  The interior was light as a feather, but not tough.  The layers inside were stretchy and would separate as I pulled with my fingers.  The flavor was buttery with a natural sweet goodness. 

The fineries here are a wonderful splurge.  If you are craving something decidedly different, what better way to fulfilling this craving than to visit Gagy Et Jules!

Mon nouvel ami!  Je taime!"}
{"text":"My favorite macaron place in Pittsburgh. Perfectly crafted, these macarons are my family's go-to treat for birthdays and festivities. It's also located in a beautiful area in Squirrel Hill; great place to stroll around in warmer weather. Also, their other pastries are delicious. I mainly go because I love the macaron displays where they stack the pastries into a tower."}
{"text":"Beautiful AND delicious. The modern decor of the storefront is a great juxtaposition against the delicate pastries inside. Full disclosure: I personally am not a huge fan of french macarons. However, I tried a nibble or two of the ones I bought for my family and I found them pretty yummy. Great flavor combinations and a lot to choose from. The basil white chocolate was delicate and fresh, was my favorite of the ones I tried."}
{"text":"I would give 1 star based on the sweets and the price, but I gave 2 because it was a very clean shop and the macarons were good.

pretty expensive french pastry but not so fresh. the only good thing in there were the macarons.

all of the sweets look delicious, but if you taste them, you might change your mind.

I have been to a lot better places for pastries and sweets."}
{"text":"These little macarons were pretty delicious. I am a little biased because I don't have a huge sweet tooth and many things taste too sweet to me. However,  I thought the lavender macaron was just awesome. Perfect flavor, not too sweet, unique (not too sure what lavender taste was before this...) and just so good. Also tried earl grey and it was also pretty good flavor but too sweet. 

But the packaging is the thing that gets me cuz it's so cute and I'm a sucker for those cutesy things. Will come back next time to try this white chocolate basil that everyone keeps talking about~"}
{"text":"Macaroons are delicious. They are light and full of flavor.  I ordered the sea salt Carmel, white chocolate basil, and pistachio. 

White Chocolate basil-  the basil was nicely balanced with the white chocolate.  It was an unexpected pairing but delicious. 
Sea Salt Carmel was sweet with a hint of salt
Pistachio is my go to macaroon, and i was not disappointed.  

I also ordered a palmier and a croissant.  Both of which I'd go back for. 

The bakery is really beautiful inside and the open kitchen is a nice touch. The staff was helpful and friendly.  I thought the prices were as expected.  You get what you pay for and this place was well worth the price."}
{"text":"The macaroons are amazing! The inside of the patisserie is very beautiful and clean. I really love how they showcase all the desserts. Everyone who was working there was super friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"By far the best bakery in Pittsburgh, Gaby et Jules makes excellent macarons. I always stop in if I am in Squirrel Hill or I drop by the counter in Market Square. Earl Grey, White Chocolate Basil, and that one with apricot are my go-to favorites, but you really can't go wrong no matter what you choose. I also recommend the canele, which is caramelized on the outside and custardy on the inside. To top it all off, the quality is great, but I've never had more than one or two people ahead of me in line and the prices are very reasonable compared to macarons I've had in the $3-4 range. It's nice to have a great French bakery and not have to wait in lines - the perks of being in a smaller city!"}
{"text":"Gaby et Jules is great! They always welcome you with Bon jour, it is such a cute place. I probably tried all their fancy desserts, the one that's always there at least. They always come out with new one. They're pricey though, but it's definitely quality fancy desserts. The packaging is so cute too. I always bring home different desserts when I drive back home to see my family. They absolutely love it :-D"}
{"text":"Why do these delicious little delicacies have to be so expensive?? I'd like to say a box of 12 lasts my husband and I a few days, but it never does. Our favorite flavors are the rose, the chocolate, and the speculoos. I also really enjoy the Royal if I'm craving chocolate."}
{"text":"This is a such a nice little bakery in Squirrel Hill. When I want to treat myself this is the first place I go. The macaroons are delightfully scrumptious. So many choices. Taking a dozen or so to a party always makes me a hit."}
{"text":"This place makes amazing macarons. Their pastries are absolutely beautiful as well!

Unfortunately, all I've tried is their macarons. I've never had one of their gorgeous pastries. I even love stopping in and just looking at them! They're like art! The macarons are delicious. My favorite flavors are salted caramel, earl grey and Nutella. 

Please come try this place out for the most delicious macarons around!"}
{"text":"Thank you for making my mouth so happy. Clean, professional and masters of their craft. Probably one of the best French bakery's I have ever been to. 5 stars! 2 enthusiastic thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey but soooooo worth it!  Before I went to Gaby et Jules, I totally underestimated the power of the macaron.  But that's because I never had the right kind - the kind that you can only get from Gaby et Jules.  I do not claim to be a dessert connoisseur but these macarons are just heavenly.  They are perfectly crisp on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth chewy on the inside, with the perfect ratio of crispy to gooey/chewy.  It is hard to describe but I am trying.  Also, they are not overloaded with sugar but have just the right amount of sweetness to scintillate your taste buds.  Along with whichever flavor you choose, it will be like tasting a slice of heaven in every bite.  If you do not feel this way the first time, it may be because you did not find the right flavor for you.  Or maybe try a second or third one until you find that place inside you that goes, \"omg I can't believe I've ever lived without this dessert\"  My favorite is the champagne flavor which is seasonal.  My favorite staple flavors are pistachio and champagne.

Other than the macarons, their pastries and other desserts are also very good.  I have only tried a couple of them so I cannot speak on them, but I think the real star of the show are the macarons here which are unparalleled in their perfection. I cannot pass by this store when I'm out on Forbes without stopping by to grab a couple of them. They are also great as gifts and come packaged in cute red boxes if you buy a half dozen or a dozen!"}
{"text":"Went here during the soft opening.  There was a bit of a line, but it moved quickly and everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there.

We tried a few of the macarons. I was a fan, but my husband didn't like them as much.  I felt that the rose flavored macaron was overpowering, but the others such as earl grey and strawberry, were much more balanced.

We also tried on of the pretty cakes (small one). I don't remember what the name was, but it was banana and chocolate.  My husband loved this.  I found the texture too soft, but the flavors were delicious.

The last thing we tried was a pain au chocolat.  I liked it and thought the chocolat was very high quality, but I thought it was not as crunchy and flakey as I would have liked.  

I can't wait to go back and try some more things"}
{"text":"Finally a macaron!  I've been seeking one out since I moved to PA a year ago, and they're just not that easy to come by.  I was visiting a friend in Pittsburgh this past week, and we happened upon this place, which she raved about.  She generously purchased the 7 for $15 for me, and the family and I tried so many flavors!  The violet was extremely strong, and I don't know if I could handle that again.  However, the chocolate, the salted caramel and the mango were all delightful!  The white chocolate basil was a little peculiar for my tastebuds as well, but I'm pleased with the texture and presentation of the macarons.  My bud has tried the many other pastry options as well, and they all looked exquisite.  I would definitely stop in again if I'm in the city!"}
{"text":"Very tasty desserts. As in you'll want to go back every day. Until you realize how much that would strain your bank account (and the waistline of your pants). Seriously good stuff though. I had a bar of chocolate mousse coated in dark chocolate. And wished I could eat many, many more."}
{"text":"If you want to impress the heck out of people next time you get invited to dinner, bring a box of  little Gaby et Jules pastries for dessert.  Every time the box gets opened, people stand around and go, \"Ooh! Pretty!\" 

They are simply the most beautiful-looking and artful pastries in town (the Yelp photos say it all), and they're obviously delicious to boot.  I mean, plan on paying at least $5 a piece, but it's well worth it.   

The citrus-y desserts (my personal favorite type on the planet; who needs chocolate?) were fantastic-- the lemon tartlette and le sensation are the best; not to tart/sour or too sweet.  The L'opera (coffee-flavored French buttercream + almond cake + chocolate ganache) is also quite special.  

Macarons-- their specialty item-- are just not my thing, so I can't really comment on those.  Why eat dry cookies and pasty meringue when you can eat a lovely pastry instead?  I just don't get it.  I am biased.  That being said, many of my friends rave about the macarons at Gaby et Jules."}
{"text":"SO YUMMYYYYYYYY.

SC and I were in PGH visiting and were craving dessert. This place had great reviews on Yelp so we decided to check it out! 

Gaby Et Jules has a lot of pretty pastries but we were there to buy macarons. We got the lavender cassis, peach violet, mango saffron, white chocolate basil, and le pittsburgh. The mango was our least favorite (which was disappointing; we love mango!). There just wasn't any detectable mango nor saffron flavor. The white chocolate basil was our favorite- beautiful basil flavor! We really enjoyed the other flavors also- we've had macarons from a lot of places and we loved how the macarons here (minus the mango one) had so much flavor infused in them. We loved them so much we went back the next day to buy more for our trip back home haha."}
{"text":"I love the store front of this place - from the inside out it's so colorful!

I bought a dozen macarons here for a friend's birthday. The woman who helped me was wonderful:

- She noticed I was carrying a cake from another store and offered to give me a bag for it
- When I requested a random sample of popular flavors, she asked whether or not to include alcoholic flavors
- She provided a flavor guide to go with my purchase, so that my friend could tell the flavors apart

I couldn't help getting a macaron for myself (Earl Grey flavor). I very much enjoyed it, but be warned it was very sweet

They also had free samples at the counter of one of their cheesecakes! The only downside is that macarons are so expensive. At $2+, definitely more of a rare treat than a regular spot

(by the way, my friend loved the gift!)"}
{"text":"Prices are steep! Macaroons are NYC prices except in NYC they are twice the size. These are samplers size. Overall they taste okay not special by any means. One of those places where you might want to try cause it is there. But probably won't miss it if you don't go back."}
{"text":"It's pricey but the best pastry shop you could find in Pittsburgh if you are craving for European style sweets( not like typical American gross icing sweets ughhhh)"}
{"text":"Tried their croissants (chocolate, almond, and plain). They were great for a quick morning bite, though I was a little surprised that they were very much not fresh, despite having grabbed them only 30 minutes after opening.

Almond was my favorite. Will have to come back for some of their desserts which looked appetizing."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place 100s of times and finally stepped inside recently and it exceeded my expectations! The woman helping me choose my selections was so nice and answered all of my questions. I got 3 boxes of macarons for gifts and they were so cute and tied with red ribbons. I also got the cookie butter macaron for myself, and I ate it for breakfast ... and it was definitely a good decision. 

The other desserts in the case all looked incredible. Like works of art. I cannot wait to go back and try other things from this bakery!"}
{"text":"Salted caramel macaroons are fantastic. Sweet, but really good. I also really like their nougatine."}
