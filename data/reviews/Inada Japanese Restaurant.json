{"text":"Went there yesterday June 01,2013  The service sucks!!! the waitress had to be told several times we need plates, chopstick, soy sauce containers! We asked for water and glasses and told there were no glasses. Eventually they gave us 5 glasses (there were 8 of us). The glasses are sticky and yucky!  We were told there were no more noodles and other stuff in their limited menu. We had to change our orders several times.  We had to ask for our soup and it came lukewarm. It came later than our entree. We had to remind and ask for the salad and they ran out so they just gave us seaweed - again just 5 bowls instead of 8.  We had 2 people order tempura and only 1 came out. We were all done and they were still cooking the last tempura so we had to just cancel it.  Then our bill came and we were overcharged  - 3 tempura although we only got 1!  They were trying to appease us that if we come back for dinner we might get a chance to have a free dinner - NO WAY!  NOT COMING BACK EVEN IF IT IS FREE!!!!"}
{"text":"this sushi buffet has a pretty good selection to choose from. The environment is quite modern. of course, the food taste pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Pros: - GREAT food! - Incredible service (so good it's scary) - Fairly priced - High ceilings and modern designs - Great for large parties - Extremely friendly staff  Cons: - As friendly and attentive the staff was, the English was lacking, and communication was difficult (they spoke to us in cantonese, we only know mandarin)   I just came back from here, about 30 mins ago. And it was great! I've had my share of AYCE Japanese food, and Inada was perfection!   My boyfriend and I decided to try out this place, as we were just across shopping at the NCIX. I also ended up reading some reviews on Yelp about it the day before, and decided to give it a try. My boyfriend isn't exactly too huge on Japanese food, so it takes a lot to please him. But he absolutely loved it!   Here's what we ordered:  - Takoyaki:  Great flavour, squid in the middle wasn't too rubbery/chewy. But the inside was a little too mushy for my liking. Almost as if only the outside was cooked. I'm not too sure if it's supposed to be like that, as I've only had takoyaki once in my whole life, and when I did, the batter was certainly more cooked. All things considered, it was very appetizing!  - California Hand Roll: Figured that since we were in a Japanese place, we would try the sushi. And it was DELISH. Honestly, the best sushi I've ever had. BUT, BUT, BUT, we are not sushi fans, so I can't really base it off a lot since I've never been to any really upscale or highly acclaimed sushi places! So don't take my word too heavily on this one!  - Beef Fried Rice: Honestly, it was so-so. I liked it, my boyfriend not so much. It was just A LOT of soy sauce to be honest, but it was decent!   - Beef Ribs:  VERY tender! You know when you get those thinly sliced ribs, and you have to almost gnaw to get the meat off? This took almost no effort to rip of the bone. It's also got this great undertone of ginger in it. Very good!  - Beef Slices: I don't remember what they were called, I'm not sure if it was under teppenyaki, so I'm just gonna call them beef slices. They were good, not something I would rave over. It was just beef.  - Pork Katsu: Extremely delicious. Nice and crispy, and the sauce drizzled over it was to die for. But then again, it'd be hard to screw up katsu to be honest.   - Potato Croquette (called fried potato pancake or something on the menu): Nice, moist, tasty deep fried goodness! It had a hint of curry flavour in it, which I'm surprised wasn't even mention by the server or the menu. But it's okay, because I'm a huge fan of curry anyways! Just a warning to those who might be put off by curry!  - Shrimp and Taro Tempura: Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Nice and light, just like tempura should be! The taro was a total hit too with my boyfriend and I!  - Roasted Eggplant (or baked eggplant, I don't remember): Eggplant is actually my favourite veggie, and whenever I see it on a menu, I'll always get it! But this was a bit of a disappointment. It was cooked to perfection, not too mushy, but not too hard also. I just think it wasn't seasoned, or maybe under seasoned. It tasted just like bland eggplant with benito flakes, which gave it a slight fishy flavour.  - Curry Chicken Skewers: Was kinda meh for me. I liked it, but it's just something I probably wouldn't order again. My boyfriend really liked it though. It did have a nice BBQ/char flavour to it. But I usually like to go to restaurants for foods that I wouldn't be able to make at home! lol xD  - Pork Katsu Ramen: Nothing to rave about, but it was good nonetheless!   - Flounder Teppenyaki: Was probably one of my most favourite things I ate all night! Very tasty, and cooked beautifully!   - Mango Salad: Well, it's mango salad. Can't really say much haha.  - Mango Yogurt & Mango Ice Cream: Both were amazing! Bursting with mango flavour! Just the way I like it!  Now let's talk about the service. I don't think I've ever went to a restaurant with service this top notch. They genuinely seemed happy to serve you, had a smile on their faces the whole time, and were informative about items on the menu if you weren't familiar with it! But here's the thing. They knew just when to come, at the RIGHT moment. Everytime my boyfriend and I had finished eating, and we would look at the menu to order something else, somebody would seriously come whizzing by to take our order! Is that service or what? There was no hand waving, no signaling and no flagging down our waitress! Pretty impressive for an Asian place!  The only bad thing was the language barrier, but hey, it was liveable. We ended up just pointing things on the menu anyways!  All in all, I enjoyed Inada a ton! And will definitely be going back! My boyfriend's birthday is in 2 weeks, and I think we might just celebrate there! It's just THAT good! Go and try it for yourself if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the lunch experience and not the AYCE, cause I have yet to try that. But I've been to lunch before and found it veerrryyy affordable. On avg you can get a meal for $5 that comes with miso soup and dessert. Portions are just right for lunch, and food quality (I've ordered both a tempura meal and a salmon teppanyaki meal before) was fairly good especially considering its price. With a meal you can also pay about an extra $1 or so to add a 6 piece roll to your meal. So to recap, that's about $6-7 for a soup, dessert, entree, AND a roll. Service was also decent, pretty friendly and they tried their best to communicate in english which I appreciated for the sake of my friends! Although the food at this place isn't like \"OMG IT'S GREAT\" I do feel that for the price and value of food you get, this is surely an excellent lunch destination. Come before 3 though cause it ends after that!!"}
{"text":"We were neglected... told to hurry our ordering because the restaurant was very busy while ample seats were to be had all over... then forgotten... it's like we somehow walked into a service black hole.  - We got our own menus as the waiters didn't bother to give us any.  - We asked for utensils twice before any arrived for our group of eight.  - We all ordered set lunch menus that came with soup, salad and dessert. 2 salads came... Then nothing. We subsequently asked five times, to three different wait staff as there wasn't one that was specifically assigned to our table, before the rest of the salads came - with the exception of one because they ran out of salad. We were then compensated with an 'upgraded' but extremely sad looking seaweed salad. - A table that came in much later after us received their salads way before the salads came to our table. - Then we were told that they were out of soup and were in the process of making more... during Sunday lunch hour. The soup arrived after most of our mains were finished.  I say 'most' because one of our members still didn't his main order after the rest of us had finished eating (!!!)  - The restaurant ran out of tuna... And only told two members of our group while the third one waited... and waited... I think the restaurant would have totally forgotten that he had ordered anything if the rest of us were so annoyed at that point our displeasure was pretty obvious. - The spicy salmon, was not spicy. - 2 people ordered the salmon lunch main and basically, it was a thin slice of fish steak that was sliced into two pieces. Each person got one half in their order. - We were charged for the tuna order that never existed...  I've been here before and I recall it being unmemorable, but not quite this bad. I don't know what happened here, but I would definitely say this - do not come here unless you want to be told that you're not wanted by the wait staff taking your order, and then be treated as a fly on the wall."}
{"text":"This is a newly opened all you can eat Japanese restaurant in Midland and Finch owned by Chinese.  Things that I liked: - service was prompt - food came very fast - environment was comfortable  Things I didn't like: - not a lot of food on menu - rolls were not properly made - sushi rice was not real Japanese rice (to me, not the same texture as the authentic ones) - green tea ice cream sold out - BIG fail - most dessert items were not available - Arctic Surf Clam sold out  - udon didn't taste good (they were funny looking and texture was like pasta)  Overall, the food quality was not great with the price.  Although I don't expect much from an AYCE place, I wish at least they had more variety of dessert so that I could leave the restaurant with a happy mood!"}
{"text":"I went to Inada japanese restaurant with friend for dinner. Walking up to the restaurant, we can see that it had its grand opening not too long ago. Looking through the glass, there was a good amount of customer, that was a good sign.   It had a very modern open decor which was very nice, as it allowed the staff to see each table. We discovered that it was an all you can eat restaurant upon arriving. I was a little worried as most all you can eat place's food are mediocre. We were greeted with by a friendly girl at the door.  As we sat down, I bumped into a couple friends and sat at the table next to them.  We quickly ordered a bunch of stuff from the menu, it was a very big menu. But we soon found the quality of the dishes made up for it.  The dishes I highly recommend is the garlic cube steak and the flounder teppanyaki. It was sooo good!   The way you had to order was you had to order the exact portion(pieces) you wanted, which I found very good, it allowed you to try a little of everything on the menu. The sashimi was fresh, and the serving of the other food was a very good size.   We tried to order a jar of fresh watermelon juice which I was surprised to see on an all you can eat menu. Unfortunately it was not available as they just opened, we were slightly disappointed. We ordered lemon water instead so we could keep our palate fresh to taste each dish. They did not offer it on their menu, but were more than happy to accommodate us.   Halfway through our first order, a waitress came up to us and told it was last call, which was partly our fault for going an hour before they closes. We ordered our second round with a vengeance. The food was pretty good which explains why our eyes were bigger than our stomach, meaning we ordered more than we could possibly finish. We tried our best to finish the dishes and it wasn't because there were any penalty for over ordering or anything like that, but it would be a shame to waste good tasting food.   After putting a valued effort, we gave in and ordered dessert. Again the dessert was perfectly proportion. I ordered the green tea ice cream and mango yogurt and my friend ordered the red bean dessert.   The dessert was very good. We wanted to try the rest of the dessert on the menu, but was too full. Fortunately my friends beside us were able to give me a great feedback. Our friends beside our table left fully satisfied as we were as well.   I would definitely come back to this restaurant and highly recommend it to anyone who likes Japanese food and very hungry.  : )"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with relatives and we liked the atmosphere if the restaurant and it was very clean.  We all ordered the all you can eat option.  The sushi was good and I especially liked their sashimi.  A great price for all you can eat.  Not the best sushi I've ever had but it was good for the price.    My only complaint would be the service, they forgot a few items and brought is things we did not order."}
{"text":"Not as good as when they first open. I heard that they have financial issues, so they lower the level of the service and food quality and less food choices."}
{"text":"***UPDATE** This place has closed down and is now a new Japanese restaurant.  4 stars!  My coworker and I had driven here for lunch today, and because we had already tried the sushi competitor across the parking lot, we thought we would try Inada this time around! This was definitely a good choice!  The decor was clean and modern. The service was great, the waiters were very friendly and attentive. This restaurant just opened up two months ago and when we went around 1:30 in the afternoon, there may have been only 5-7 tables that were occupied at the time.  Inada serves AYCE for lunch and dinner, at the same prices: Monday - Thursday  Adults (including sashimi): $22.99 Seniors or No sashimi: $17.95  Friday - Sunday Adults (including sashimi): $24.99 Seniors or No sashimi: $18.95  I thought it was quite pricey when I first saw the prices for AYCE. When I saw the lunch specials and regular menu, I thought that they were more decent (some of the lunch specials were around $6.99). However, since we hadn't been here before, we thought we would try a bit of everything, so we got the AYCE (no sashimi). With taxes and service charge/gratuity, it came to $22 per person.  The food tasted so much better than most of the Japanese restaurants in Scarborough. There was also a good variety of dishes as well. The rice had a nice rice vinegar flavour, the sushi pieces weren't too big nor too small. The portions seemed like tapas style, which is great, because between two of us, eating an 8-piece dynamite roll would have been way too much. They gave about 4 pieces and for spicy salmon, they gave 3 pieces. The spicy beef udon noodle soup was also delicious and flavourful with a somewhat chewy-textured udon, which is what I like!  They also have dessert, including ice cream, mango yogurt, and mousses. The chocolate mousse was great. The ice cream was perfect and the bowls weren't cold so you knew that they weren't pre-scooped. The strawberry mousse and mango yogurt were good too.  I would definitely come back here and introduce this place to my Scarborough friends!"}
{"text":"Inada does offers affordable lunch options. From $4.99?! that includes soup, salad and dessert?! Inada does offers dirty cheap lunch...,  There are choices of Sushi, Tempera, Teriyaki, Udon on the menu to choose from so everyone would get something they enjoy.  Complimentary soup is fish soup, which was different to the usual miso soup is quite good. Salad is decent with a nice gingery dressing   S4 Inada Special ($6.99) and a side order of Salmon Maki ($ 1.65)  - Spicy Salmon Sushi (2), Flying Fish Roe Sushi (2) and California Roll - At this price point, the fish was fresh and most of the rolls are nicely made   Mango yogurt as dessert was ok.. because it is free?!  The deco is modern and nice, love the high ceiling. Service is friendly and attentive.  Definitely good choice in the area if you are looking for a affordable lunch experience. Seems like a lot of the seniors in the area are here to enjoy a leisure lunch!"}
{"text":"Ended up here at this All You Can Eat after not knowing where to go for dinner.  We arrived on a Saturday night not long after 8:30pm and as we were ordering things, they were already out of a lot of food. Right when we got here, Miso soup and seaweed salad was sold out.  Food came at a decent timing but it always seemed impossible to find a waiter for further assistance. Many of the items I ordered took long to come as time went on and it wasn't until later that they told me it was sold out (which explained why it never came).  I ordered pork Katsu right for my \"first round\" and kept asking for them to check my order. In the end, order was never put through and didn't get it until 10pm.   Overall it has a good selection of food which tasted good (except their sirloin which was overlooked) but I probably wouldn't come back because of the price ($24.99 weekend dinner + 10% automatic tip) and slow service.  My original score was 2/5 but I gave them an extra star since I came \"late\" on a Saturday night which may explain all my mishaps."}
