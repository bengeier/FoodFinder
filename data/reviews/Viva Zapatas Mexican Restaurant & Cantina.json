{"text":"I frequent here all the time! I love the atmosphere, the music, the service, the cerveza, and most of all... the Food! Have you heard their \"Happy Birthdays\"? That's the best Happy Birthday celebration you'll ever hear in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Best mexican place to eat. Great staff and fantastic food. Lunch menu is perfect. One of the best."}
{"text":"excellent food! visitors from out of town alway ask to go here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Large portions great value. We tried 2 of the combo meals and the carne asada taco meal.  Very flavorful and fresh.  The reviews are accurate and I would totally recommend and come here again"}
{"text":"Wow! Good food and very fast. I went in Tuesday at 1pm. Still a big lunch crowd but my chicken enchiladas were to my table within 5 minutes. I also took a carne asada burrito to go. Great chips, salsa and bean dip!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, great service and the food was delicious. I've finally found a good Mexican restaurant in Vegas!  3 years later..."}
{"text":"Absolutely the very best Mexican food restaurant I have ever been to, anywhere. Out of everything that has ever been ordered between myself, my husband, and any of our friends and family we have come here with, no one has ever had anything bad. This place is amazing from the food to the service. Customer for life, without a doubt. I even bought a few of their shirts! :P"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Definitely one of the best Mexican food restaurants in North LV. The fajitas and fresh guacamole are especially good. Customer service is usually great but can drop off during busy times. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Vegas and coming From a Mexican families down south of Texas.... as south as you can get, I was a little skeptical eating Mexican food here. We decided to take the risk and were impressed. The service was excellent and so fast! The food, although differently prepared, was delicious. I had never had enchiladas that were filled with shredded beef. My honey absolutely loved his food also. We were almost going to ask for someone to roll us out...that's how much we ate. I will admit that the sopapillas were a little thicker than what I'm used to but still very good. Definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, the staff are wonderful and this is the best authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas hands down!!"}
{"text":"My daughter & I went for lunch and there was only 1 server with a large party of 12 people sitting next to us, it took over 40 minutes to get fish tacos & chimichanga, I had complained prior to getting food and came down with food poisoning the next day!! I would NOT eat there!!"}
{"text":"I have yet to find a superior Mexican joint in Las Vegas.  Service is also great.  Atmosphere is also very nice.  It is not in a great part of town, so watch yourself.  Margarita selection is good."}
{"text":"I think it's too expensive for the type of food served. I've been there a couple of time and food is ok. Service is good and I guess it takes the usual time time prepare food as any other Mexican restaurant. Not bad for the family."}
{"text":"I ate here with my family and it was a great experience. We were immediately greeted and seated so it wasn't too busy on a Sunday afternoon. Their service was AMAZING. Our waitress was super nice and our chips, salsa, and water kept getting refilled when needed. It took a while for our main entrees but it was worth it. I ordered flautas with beans and rice. The flautas were crispy but soft at the same time. It had a nice balance to it. The rice and beans weren't too bad as well! I was soo full but it was from eating too much of those chips!! lol Overall my fam and I enjoyed the meal, service, and ambiance of this restaurant. I would definitely come back again and hello...there's live music too!! :)"}
{"text":"Food is decent.  Yummy guac made at the table. The meal itself was ok. However I cannot in good conscience give high stars to a restaurant who limits a military discount to \"just the active duty member\". If you are going to offer a discount it should be extended to their family members at the table also. Not just the military members meal. Seriously?! Who does that? We used to get the discount off the whole ticket. Not sure when that changed. Been going to this restaurant ages. Going to rethink that now. There are plenty of other options in Mexican cuisine. Those who do offer the \"whole\" table... children and the spouses of military a discount without them being present. It may seem I'm being petty over a few dollars. It's just the way I was treated when I enquired. When I took my children without my husband. Shame on this restaurant being so close to a military installation and being this stingy. Especially when every time I go their is plenty of military handing over their money. Keeping this business open."}
{"text":"The food here is always great. The staff is always nice and attentive. Today I placed an order to go and was disappointed.  I ordered the flautas meal.  They gave me all the fixings to put my meal together. It was tasty however the gave me chicken when I ordered beef.  There's nothing worse than expecting something and biting into something else."}
{"text":"Appetizer came the same time as our entree (after an hour) ,  all the food was cold,  and the buss boy spilled my food on me. The place is also so family friendly everywhere I looked there was a crying child. Two stars cause the food would have been good if it was hot."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Mexican food in North Las Vegas, this is the best! There are so many Mexican Restaurants in the area, sit down and fast food, it can be a little overwhelming. My husband and I have tried many of the different options, and used Yelp to guide us, and we have enjoyed our trips here every time! (We are very picky when it comes to our Mexican food.) It has authentic Mexican food, live music on the weekends, a very friendly staff, and a great atmosphere.   Parking can be a little tight when they are busy, so I would try and come a little earlier if you can."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service.  The food is really good.  I always order the \"Doce\" for lunch and I'm never disappointed.  Great for small and large griups.  One of my gotos off the strip.  If your also thirsty they have some of the best Margueritas in vegas."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time based on yelps reviews and all I can say is it was excellent. Yes, The parking is poor, and not very many tables inside, but they seated us quickly and parking issues won't keep me from a good meal. All of the employees were very polite and helpful. The guy playing the guitar and singing was great. The food was excellent and service was quick. Nothing bad to say at all. On second thought, it was horrible. All you people stay away so it doesn't get too busy and I can go more often."}
{"text":"Terrific service and great authentic food! Fresh guacamole made at your table.  Despite being super busy the waiter noticed I got a red smothered tamale and offered to replace it! Shows attention to customer and detail. When I come to Vegas I will always come here to eat! Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"The bomb.coldest modelo beer on tap ever in town. when you come here you are treated like family.was blown away with the service.it deserve 10 stars"}
{"text":"This was definitely not a restaurant I would have tried had I not read the reviews on yelp first.  It's not in the best neighborhood and looks rundown from the outside.  I have now learned that appearances mean nothing.   The food was fantastic, and that's coming from someone who is not a big fan of Mexican food.   I had the tacos design Carne Asada and they were wonderful. The meat was so tender it melts in your mouth.  Add that to homemade tortillas and tortilla chips, and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We happened to find it when we were staying just a few blocks away for Electric Daisy Carnival & immediately fell in love!  The food is delicious, large portions, authentic Mexican food, & friendly/attentive staff!  The chili rellenos are incredible, the cilantro steak was the best cilantro dish I've ever had & the drinks are cheap. The prices here are very reasonable (we had drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees for $50). We were in Vegas for 4 days & visited Viva Zapatas twice, we will be back next summer & intend to visit this place again.  Also, the decor is very tasteful and interesting to look at & avoids the cheesiness that many restaurants get into. The thing we liked the most about this place is that it's a bit out of the way but they really focus on a comfortable, friendly atmosphere, which you don't really find on the strip."}
{"text":"When I went, there was live music and I really loved the authentic feel to it. The food was amazing with generous portions and the customer service was quick and excellent. I never had an empty glass of water through the entire meal. The only thing I didn't like was the dirty sticky menus but I'll live."}
{"text":"We were looking for place to celebrate my moms birthday! My husband remembered this place he visited few months ago and i checked reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. I couldn't be happier!!! Delicious Food! Live music! The most friendly customer service! We had sooo much fun!! Their guacamole is a must!! And Margaritas are the best!!! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"It sucked! Very nice inside that's pretty much it. Long  Wait, over crowded,by the way 100 capacity.burnt shrimp, yup sucks. I really don't like these types of places. I'm Mexican,so I know what a simple enchilada is supposed to taste like look Like even smell like.for example, they American up authentic dishes with American cheese instead of queso cotija or queso fresco, come on! Velveta cheese on enchilada?"}
{"text":"I had the Carne Asada villa, hubby had three carne Asada tacos.  Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks, live music, and service! You will not be disappointed! Great atmosphere for a date or to watch the game at the bar. I would make a trip to Vegas just to come here again."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Our server Ramon!!! Was the best. Environment was great food Outstanding thanks...."}
{"text":"This place has the best, margarita's like fish bowl size!! and have every tequila you can imagine. they start you with fresh chips from cooker and serve you up, a assortment of salsa 3 to be exact!!! Shrimp cocktail is with monster prawns !!! I had a enchilada & shredded taco dinner !!! It was very tasty!!! and filling! I recommend this place even if it's just for shot's of tequila & beer, at the bar !! nice decor & good service!"}
{"text":"The soup starter and service was great. However, the margaritas were very disappointing and could stand to have a little more tequila."}
{"text":"I'm still here waiting, 45 min now for 6 tacos, not even combo orders, simple orders but they lack the urgency to wait on customers,I will not be back"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican restaurant!  The food here is all authentic and is some of the most delicious Mexican food I have ever had.  They serve unlimited chips and salsa with hot bean dip!  The tacos were outstanding and the prices on the lunch portions were very good.  We went again for dinner 2 days later and the food was just as outstanding as the first time around.  They also had live music when we went for dinner (Friday night).  Musician was very good and definitely contributed to the wonderful ambiance at this restaurant."}
{"text":"The beans.... Oh the beans! And they're complimentary. Along with the Fideo soup. Oh, man! I would eat just that, it makes me so nostalgic for meals from my past.  With that said, everything we have tried has been very good. We have been here a few times and have not been disappointed. The parking lot is a hot mess and the seating area is small but once you sit down and they bring the complimentary beans, salsa, chips and soup I am already so happy that I end up ordering a small meal to share with someone! So if you want to get off the strip and have a good, more authentic Mexican meal head over to Viva Zapatas!"}
{"text":"Looking for food poisoning while in Vegas? Well then this is your one stop shop! I went with a party of four and we all woke up vomiting the next day. The food is far from authentic, unless you consider tainted chicken authentic."}
{"text":"Loved it. We had pork burrito with green sauce and cheese enchiladas.  The food takes a while to come out,  but tastes like made to order.  Worth it!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit here, and I was solo, so naturally I took a seat at the bar so as not to take up an entire table or booth.  The bartender/waitress was super nice and the salad I ordered was amazing (chicken, avocado, something delicious in a ranch cesar type dressing)!  I was only drinking an Arnold Palmer since I had to drive but I was not rushed from the bar and that was much appreciated.  There was also a great singer with his guitar (not too loud and complementary to the atmosphere).  There seemed to be many happy hour specials on drinks and I hope to partake on my next visit into town."}
{"text":"What a great ambiance!  Came here for dinner on Saturday night.  They had the mariachis playing sappy songs.  You have a lady sitting behind a glass window, making fresh tortillas, patting them down back and forth between her hands.  It was a very interesting atmosphere.  I had ordered the mole (pronounced molli).  It was an interesting concoction of spices.  And to end the meal, I had their deep-fried ice cream.  I know...talk about calorie-city.    But love, love, love this place."}
{"text":"The food here was really good and they have a singer playing soft spanish music which was nice after a long weekend of partying :) The only negative thing I have to say is the wait was ridiculous. We were a party of 12 and we waiting for our food to come out for about an hour and 20 minutes. Besides that it was really good"}
{"text":"A-OK.  Even though I may occasionally forget my own definition of the terms, I believe there is a difference between food and cuisine.  Respectively, this is the difference from just getting some yummy eats and a dining, gastronomical experience.  Typically, I also have a problem with this, because I find cuisine only marginally more enjoyable, and sometimes, I disagree that it justifies the price-hike.  I'm a foody -- not a cuisine-y.  Yet, if we can turn a $6 burger into a $60 burger by changing the meat, I guess it would be hypocritical to say a difference in use of cheese, tomato, and corn can make cuisine.  Anyway, I came here thinking I was just going to get some Mexican food, but instead I found myself getting some Mexican cuisine.  I'm not saying I was disappointed, but I wasn't pleasantly surprised either.  Usually when dealing with cuisine, it means you have to also wait a little longer to get in and get out.  Here was no different.  I just wouldn't figure the place next to a gas station as classy, but the place really is quite so.  The staff is very professional; the bar is VERY well stocked with tequila; and the decor is above-par.  Though you do have to pay for all this in the end.  Unfortunately, I broke my own rule for trying a Mexican establishment new to me: I usually get carnitas so I have an equal point of comparison.  Instead I got the taco salad off their lunch menu because of a recommendation, and because I wasn't looking to spend as much as I could have here.  While I we waited, we got the obligatory chips and salsa.  As a special note, they also provide frijoles without having to ask for it.  I decided to go one further, and asked to have some salsa verde as well.  The salsa verde here comes out piping hot, but either way, all three were pretty good dips.  The taco salad comes in either beef or chicken, and I opted for the latter.  A risky decision as most of my experiences with shredded white meat chicken have been unappetizingly dry, but the waiter assured me.  He was no liar.  Possibly the best execution of Mexican shredded chicken I've tasted to date.  The size of the whole thing wasn't too bad, but for the price, I probably should try something else next time.  So for not quite being my thing, I still enjoyed myself enough."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant I've had in a long time. If I could I would come back here to dine again.  I had the \"taco de lengua \" although it was small it definitely made up in its taste. There was live music by one guy wich was amazing.  I think that the interior design was nice with all of the items on the wall."}
{"text":"This place is great! My husband & I love the enchilladas and margargaritas - they even make their own chips!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start...the food is passable but not great. Fish tacos were slightly less flavorful than frozen in a box. Child Colorado was bland, meat was tough and dry, chips were stale, salsa had no kick. It's not clear how, with so many tables free, there were no tables. We sat at the bar. The service was good."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in Las Vegas.  Really good service during a busy lunch hour. Chips and tortillas are made fresh, good salsa and guacamole too!"}
{"text":"I'll tell you what, this place looks like nothing from the outside, but when you get inside, you will discover the best service I have had in three years of living in vegas, that includes restaurants that cost 3x as much.   The food is outstanding, Their chicken mole is out of this world good.  Don't miss out on their mojitos, better than any restaurant in key west!"}
{"text":"Love this Mexican Restaurant. Everything was so good. Gorge helped us and he was nice and professional. We will be going again on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! The food is delicious and the service is phenomenal ! The chile verde is soooo delicious"}
{"text":"Fanfreakingtastic food. The atmosphere is amazing, service is outstanding, prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I've  been here a few times and the food is consistently good. Great lunch specials. Nice portions. Can't  go wrong eating  here."}
{"text":"I come here every so often. It's never been impressive or exquisitely good. The service is always just ok and the food is always borderline ok. However today I went and ordered their chilaquiles with steak, the difference with steak and without is 8 dollars, so I expected a nice piece of meat. When the food arrived I was surprise with a piece of meat that was so small I was unable to classify the cut the server said it is a 4 ounce piece but I would hesitate to say it was more than 2 ounces. We spoke to the manager and they reiterated that it was the right size I refused to pay and just stuck with my chilaquiles. I never expect much but this time it was just outrageously bad servings and service."}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough!!  I've tried many of their dishes and they are all authentic and leave me so full I can hardly move! I love that they have a fresh tortilla making station right there in the dining room as well as the live music, However as much as these things are fantastic in my view, my favorite part is their margaritas. They have many flavors and everyone of them are delish!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in town and a local favorite. They have a full bar and a wide variety of lunch specials. Try the guacamole; they make it at your table. Great food and even better service. I'm a regular and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Dope spot,dranks r good,food is good...nice mellow place if ur not tryna go to las islitas or something."}
{"text":"Love this place, always have great food and amazing service. I never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and they were good.   So, I thought I would give it a try. Very slow service and when the food finally came out it was  lukewarm.   Nothing special here."}
{"text":"I've eaten authentic quality Mexican food in Mexico, and tonight's meal is a flash in the past to the level of freshness, spice, flavor, and authenticity of my favorite local dishes."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. The lunch specials are well priced and the salads are great. We came in with a party of 6 at 12:15pm and had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. The service was very quick and professional. My iced tea was constantly refilled when the server noticed that my glass was half full."}
{"text":"Great food service and vibes! Love this place! I've been going here for years including my graduation dinner! I love the bean and salsa dips the soup is amazing! I recommend the carne asada tacos (: they have never failed me."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas, and you want really delicious mexican food, you owe it to yourself to eat here.  The first time I had the Cochinita a la naranja, and the second time I had Pollo en Pipian. Both were fantastic, and the horchata (free refills!) was delicious.  Seriously, eat here."}
{"text":"Just driving through, and needed a good place to eat, so I turned to yelp. Muchas gracias! We LOVED THIS PLACE! Good drinks, good food, good entertainment!"}
{"text":"Love Zapatas!!! They have live music and amazing food. My husband is Hispanic and he said it almost matches his mom's cooking. The wait staff was very professional, and the people who come between the waiters are great you never have an empty drink. Love the complimentary bean dip/salsa and chips. My daughter is one and loves the music!"}
{"text":"The wait staff and management were very courteous but the food was not tasty at all. For it to be Mexican food it was very bland and had no flavor to it. The staff saved it from being rated with one star."}
{"text":"We like Zapatas very much. I've eaten there about 50 times. It is good Mexican food for a reasonable price. All of the food is good and Dinners come with soup. Lunch menu is available until 5pm and save you a couple bucks but without soup. Happy hour goes til 6pm, and they have a few drink specials. Dinner is nice because they have live music. Good atmosphere. Actually would like to give it a 4.5 stars and think that it is one of the best mexican restaurants in Las Vegas and one of the best restaurants overall in the North East part of the City!"}
{"text":"Bad experience with this restaurant!!  I order carnitas and it look like pork chops no taste at all!!!! And the food server did not show up at all to se if everything was alright!!! The only good experience we had was at the bar! The girl or the bartender was nice!!  We won't go back there!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the 7 mares caldo. Great taste. The caldo had a lot of sea food.  service was also great. Got seated right away. Hey also had this amazing salsa. I'll be back to try the camarones."}
{"text":"Viva Zapatas Mexican food is the best Mexican food we've had since moving to west coast from NY"}
{"text":"Great food...great service!  If you don't know how to eat Mexican food with a flour tortilla you don't belong in this restaurant.  The complimentary chips, salsa, retried beans, are awesome.  I recommend the homemade guacamole.  It is made fresh right at your table.  I Ordered the mochacca breakfast and enjoyed it.  Next time I'm back in Vegas I will definitely try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Went for Lunch - The Staff while professional did not seem happy to be there. I and several other non-Spanish speaking groups were left to our own  instinct with the wait staff unwilling to explain the menu without giving the non-welcoming attitude that we were just too much trouble. So I ordered the Cognac Chicken while my wife ordered the Beef Tacos. The \"Chips\" delivered to the table were either old or cooked/re-fried at too low a temperature since they were Oily. The Bean dip was average and the tomato based dipping sauce was a dark, hot, bitter,  variety that is unique to this place. The Cognac Chicken cooked with canned mushrooms and onions actually had a strange sweet taste and the accompanying Rice and Beans were nothing special. The place was very clean as I observed one cook diligently changing gloves when interrupted at her station (excellent). I can't say anything really Great NOR Bad about this place, however I would not go out of my way to eat here as there are so many better options for the price. $ 45.00 for two counting Tip - No Alcohol, Appetizer nor Dessert."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great ambience!  We were on a road trip heading south looking for lunch close to the 15 freeway.  Thanks, Yelp, for bringing us here!  We were pleased right off the bat with the warm tortilla chips, hot bean dip, and salsa as soon as we sat down.  We're suckers for tableside guacamole, which was great as well.  The portions were huge - we only needed two entrees to feed me, my wife, and our two kids.  We got the fish tacos and the combination with a chili relleno and green chile pork burrito.  My only criticism of the food is that the peppers they used for the relleno were VERY mild and I like them to have a bit more punch.  The kids enjoyed the live mariachi and had fun watching them make the tortillas fresh behind a window in the corner of the restaurant.  All in all a pleasant meal and we were back on the freeway quickly."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, atmosphere, service!!!  I only came because of yelp reviews.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. My glass was never empty and chips and salsa never stopped. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"My sister had been wanting to come here for awhile. We finally went! I had the fish tacos(I wasn't a vegetarian yet and am not sure how friendly this place might be on that). I thought they were wonderful. A little different from what I was used to, but different isn't always bad. I loved the bean dip, salsa, and chips that was brought to our table while we waited as well. The service was fast and the place smells amazing. The atmosphere was great. There was a musician playing beautiful music, and the decorations covering the walls were interesting too."}
{"text":"Worst mexican food ever. Bad service, crappy margaritas, poor quality of food. Had to ask to order, ask for the check. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Not bad for East Coast Mexican.  Mole is worth it. Don't let the outside appearance fool you."}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner. Place was very reminicent of the kind of mexican restaurants my folks use to take me to growing up. Interior had very dim lighting, decor was appropriate, not over done. A nice break from the chain eateries. Ordered a combo and the tacos won! The best I have had since the Taco vans down in SoCal. Also, a must is the prepared to order guacamole. The waiter made it table-side, with input from us. It was delicious. Service was excellant, and noticed they had homemade sangria...For next time. A great place and kid friendly too. Also, the salsa and bean dip they put on the table with the warm chips was excellant too. Very nice a la carte menu, so easy to make it a $ instead of a $$."}
{"text":"Bomb AF Mexican food!!! Prices are fair, comes with chips, salsa, & super dank bean dip!!! Large portions!!"}
{"text":"Viva Zap is the type of restaurant I love to frequent.  It's not part of a chain, most likely a mom and pop (and grandma and grandpa) establishment that doesn't serve fast food, but good food fast.  Growing up, I didn't have the maturity to eat other cuisines. Having lived near the Mexican border years back, I had access to this incredible food made by people who took humble ingredients and made them taste great. Mexican isn't one of my favorite cuisines, but I appreciate it being available when I have that urge.  I originally wanted to get menudo, but it's only available on the weekends. Instead, I picked what I remember from the menu as \"goat soup\" or something. Braised goat meat in I believe is a tomato-based liquid.  Was a tasty meal, but I left looking like a crime scene happened on my clothing. Good thing I tend to wear darker hued clothes. Was going to order the quacamole, but thought against it, too much food for me to eat.  Will go again."}
{"text":"I had not been to this restaurant in over 6 years. I walked in today just to be treated by a rude hostess. She claimed there were no tables available but everyone that came in after me was seated promptly. I waited around but I was never offered a table. We ended up leaving. I don't think ill be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Food was great! Guacomole made in front of you was amazing. Tortillas with carne asada very good. The red salsa was ok with chips. But, great customer service!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for authentic Mexican food in LV! Love coming here with the fam!"}
{"text":"This place is really good... They brought our kids out some \"fideo\" soup as an appetizer. I love the tortilla lady in the back of the restaurant making fresh tortillas by hand... Yummmm..."}
{"text":"Good, plentiful Mexican food. Hot, fresh chips with complimentary bean dip and salsa, although I prefer pico de gallo style rather than the tomato sauce-based offering here. (Pro tip: mix the salsa into the bean dip and add a little pinch of salt.) The service is great and everyone was friendly. The restaurant's super dark, though; we had to crack the blinds to see the menu (hey, our eyes aren't as young as they used to be)."}
{"text":"The food is VERY good and priced just right. Staff is friendly and attentive. I love the atmosphere and even though its small you don't feel like other parties are sitting on top of you."}
{"text":"Beans and salsa are good but my husband is not a fan of them.  I got the chile rellenos and bean enchiladas they were good.   They had cheese on the beans that was too much cheese for me.  Chicken enchiladas were good  Cheviche de camaron was good"}
{"text":"Can I put no stars?? Goodness, I have been coming for over 16 years, never has the service been this horrible! I get it your busy it's a Sunday but passing by our table numerous times and barely acknowledging us is just rude.  We sat down and waited for our drinks over 5 minutes to get asked what we wanted, had to ask to get soup! Finally after order was taken we waited over 40 minutes. Two families, of 4 mind you,  sat down after us  and were done eating and paid their bill and yet we were still waiting on our food!  Finally when we decided to get up and leave that's when we were asked and told our food would be coming out shortly! Seriously that is what it takes for someone to show courtesy and tend to you!  Oh and get this I walk back to get managers card and name, I'm standing there hearing them talk and the man has the balls to state he had informed us our food was already coming, I CORRECTED HIM, YES YOU TOLD US OUR FOOD WAS COMING WHEN WE GOT UP TO LEAVE! BEFORE YOU LIE MAKE SURE THE PERSON ISN'T STANDING RIGHT IN FORNT OF YOU!"}
{"text":"Strong drinks, amazing food, revolutionary decor... What more could you ask for? So happy I came here!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed this Mexican Restaurant.  The food and the service was good.  We ordered a Mexican Shrimp DIsh, Glazed Chicken and Carne Asada Tacos and all was very good.  Live music played while we ate dinner which was very nice.  We all left very full and satisfied.  The price was right and I would suggest trying this restaurant some time."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about my review. I would give it a 2.5. The parking is terrible like everyone says. The salsa was really good. The live music was a nice touch. The food was just OK. I have had better Mexican food and I've had worse. I'm always suspicious of a Mexican restaurant when it is chock full of White people and no, or very few Mexican-Americans.   My husband liked his shrimp dish, but my pork dish was meh, unmemorable. I took home most of it and gave it to my husband. He will eat almost anything. I would not order a pork dish there again.   I don't know if we will be going back again, definitely not at a busy time when parking is difficult."}
{"text":"Very good food, friendly service and a great atmosphere. Be prepared to wait a bit and service can be a little slow when packed but not too bad. Food is probably the best, freshest Mexican I've had in Las Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great food, great service.  The bartender, Jackie, makes a great Margarita!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! We tried this place based on yelp and tripadvisor reviews and all the great reviews were right!  The service is outstanding and the food is awesome. We will be back:-)"}
{"text":"Great food and very authentic atmosphere. We usually go on weekends, and they always have live music playing. Usually just a guy and his guitar, but he's very good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food. Would give this place one or two more stars if the waiter would've bothered to come back to check on me after setting my plate on the table. My cup sat empty for 20 minutes. And it's not like he was busy, considering it was only me and another table behind me. Everyone else was great."}
{"text":"Wow! I have been to several Mexican restaurants in my day, this one stands out from the norm. The staff was very friendly and provided excellent service from beginning to end. The menu selection is one of the most impressive and biggest I have ever seen with regional variations to their entrees. There was no feel of commercial big-chain restaurants and the musician playing guitar and singing older traditional songs by the entrance made the place feel complete. My visiting family enjoyed every thing we ordered and I wish I had ordered the table side guacamole after seeing it made at the next table. I WILL go back there."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and authentic. My favorite here is the cilantro ribeye. If you're ever in Las Vegas I would highly recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have tried several Mexican food places in Las Vegas. This place is convenient and close to my house. The food is always good. Some times the servers can get a bit bogged down and can slow service. Parking here when the place is full is a pain. Over all a good place to grab some Mexican food if you live up North"}
{"text":"Out of all of the Lindo Michoacan and whatever locations they have Viva Zapata is the best love this place been here many many times always will have my business and the consistency from the staff to customer service is off the charts I wish I can give you 10 stars but the best I could do with this v definition this place out if you were on Pecos and Craig"}
{"text":"WOW!!! This place is a amazing. My husband and I have been here several times and it has never disappointed!! As soon as you sit down they bring you yummy chips, salsa and a spicy brean dip! Make sure you order the fresh avocado dip...they literally cut the avocados and make the dip right at your table!! This place is SO clean and the service is so on point it will blow your mind. Make sure you tip The guitar man!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally getting around to reviewing this godsend of a restaurant.  I've had Mexican food in Tijuana, Texas, California, and Florida.  This place is simply amazing!  Starting off with the chips, salsa, and bean dip the food here is excellent.  Their salsa has a unique flavor...very distinct and tasty!  Everything is served fresh!  The staff works very well together and will gladly assist even if you are not their table.  Whoever is running this place is doing a great job.  We came here at least 5 times during our visit and always left satisfied.  Everything we tried was good.  We only visited for dinner so I can't comment on the lunch.  My personal favorite was the tacos al pastor.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really like their food.  But, there is no parking, and spending an hour looking for a place on a busy street is no longer worth it.  There is also usually a waiting line, which moves rather quickly, but there is no place to wait.  People are stacked on top of each other or outside.  There are other Mexican restaurants and I think I'm going to find on.  I wish they would find a better location."}
{"text":"The first time I went there I got enchiladas and they weren't that great so about a year went by and I decided to try them again and end up getting a different plate, it was the nachos on the appetizer and it was so good. The Margaritas are worth trying at least once if you ever go. I got a nice buzz off of just one so they don't skip out on the liquor."}
{"text":"Was here last night & as always it was awesome. For my last meal on the states for awhile it certainly was the perfect choice. My wife loves it here & we dine here so often they know her order. Lol while the parking leaves a bit to be desired & lord knows it on the edge of the world it well worth venturing out of your comfort zone for easily the best Mexican Food Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"In the culinary wasteland known as East Craig Road, this is the sole exception.  It is in close proximity to Nellis AFB so if you get here right at 11, you can have a quick lunch with your significant other!  Complimentary chips, beans, and salsa, friendly bartenders, colorful Mexican decorations, and live Spanish guitar.    My wife enjoys the cheese enchiladas with chicken mole combo and I like the pollo correteado.  The sole drawback is the limited parking which I solve by parking on the otherwise of the adjacent gas station and Capriotti's.  One of the best Mexican Restaurants in Las Vegas, despite its location."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Pretty authentic.  Negra Modelo on tap.  Flour tortillas made by hand.  Service was fast"}
{"text":"I think I was the only person in Vegas who has not part-taken from this hidden local gem.  I've heard all great things from everyone over the years but never had the chance to experience it.    We met some friends there on Friday night.  The parking was a nightmare.  They had a huge section chained off where I believe alot of their customers usually park.  We ended up parking at the 7/11 and our friends had to park across the street in a vacant lot.  There was a 20 minute wait and there were people everywhere inside and outside waiting.  We decided to get a drink at the bar.  The bar is big however every seat was taken.  There were some 2 seat high tables on the side so we decided to grab one and just order drinks at the bar.  So taking a look around I felt like I took one step into Mexico.  Colorful flags draped the ceilings. The décor is fabulous.  I was already sold one minute into the place. There were a couple large parties which occupied a lot of their tables and a lot of their attention...which is probably reason for everyone waiting in the front.  We were finally seated and immediately served fresh chips, salsa and bean dip.  All of it was fantastic.  The warm bean dip was my favorite.  The BF and I ordered the chicken fajitas to share and the tortillas were fresh and homemade.  It was just enough food for us with all the chips we ate! ;).    Ambiance - Beautiful authentic Spanish atmosphere!  Service - as quick and attentive as they could be being there was a full house and large parties.  Food - a definite score.  And Parking - a bummer but we lived.  Overall good time had by all!  It wasn't just a meal it was an experience!  Totally whole heartedly recommended!  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Good food nice place but no place to park at all.just a waste of time waiting for a parking spot.space for 15 cars maybe"}
{"text":"Went there on recommendation from yelp, was not disappointed. We went early evening so the place was not full yet, but had quite a few tables taken. We were seated quickly and the waiter appeared almost immediately. Drinks came out quickly and the waiter waited until we had decided on dinner before approaching us for our order, a refreshing change from the usual hovering around and rushed feeling. The meal was outstanding, just enough spice heat to enhance the flavor not overpower it. Some might want  more heat, but for me this was just right. The table was cleared AFTER we finished each course by very attentive wait assistants, nice touch to wait, not hover. Overall service was great and food was outstanding,  Only have one downside, the lighting is dim and makes reading the menu challenging. The print on some parts of the menu is the same color as the lighting, so there is no contrast. Those of us who have a little trouble seeing in dim light might want to bring a small light. I would still  highly recommend VIVA ZAPATAS."}
{"text":"Always great food and service whenever we go.  The fresh made tortillas are excellent.  The atmosphere has a more authentic feel than most regular/generic Mexican restaurants.  There is live music, a bar and interesting decor.  Viva Zapatas falls in the medium price range."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food.  Staff is friendly and on point.  Good customer service."}
{"text":"Went here during a recent trip to Vegas, but forgot to write the review.  I want to make sure to give this business its due. This is not an area I typically visit while in town. My usual hotel wasn't able to accommodate my third night (a busy Friday) and I wound up choosing a place that had great reviews. That decision was a good one, and I followed it up by trying out Viva Zapatas due to its following on Yelp. First the bad - parking. Located adjacent to a busy service station, the parking is extremely limited. I actually waited several minutes while two people were talking outside their respective cars. I am glad I had the patience. The title should be reversed; it's a cantina & restaurant. The vibe, even on a weekday lunch, is lively, especially with the sporting events on the TVs. I actually sat at the bar -- there was a short wait for tables. But my server was quick, friendly and efficient. It took a while to get through the menu; I love tough choices.  I wound up choosing the Ayoxustla combo (chile relleno & beef taco) and enjoyed everything. It was tasty, filling and the service was excellent.  I'll come back again. It's worth the extra few minutes to enjoy a really good meal."}
{"text":"I recently visited Zapatas on my latest visit to North Vegas. I went on a Friday night around 830 and YES this place had a very long wait. The parking area is pretty big which is a plus and its very good access for entering and exiting. My only complaint was there is hardly any place to sit when you are waiting for your food. There are two small benches on the inside and maybe two on the outside.  Most people sit in their car or on the little stoop outside the restaurant. Upon entering I was greeted by two lovely hostesses who gave me a menu since I wanted to take my food to go. I decided to sit at the bar and order my food. The bartender was amazing...................although they don't have a drink menu they have a FULLY STOCKED BAR......with some of the best tequila hands down. I had the Peach Margarita first and the alcohol was not scarce :-D. After less than 5 minutes of sitting at the bar we were given Chips, Salsa, and bean dip with cheese. It was so delicious and the chips were fresh and crunchy. The salsa had a little kick to it but I love things spicy...........  Around 20 minutes later I received my food.......I ordered Shrimp and Steak tacos with a side of Chicken tamales...........The steak tacos were pretty good the meat was flavorful and the tortillas were soft..........i did not care for the salsa that came with the tacos  but it wasn't bad........The Shrimp tacos were the highlight of my meal....the shrimp was plump and had just the right seasoning on them .......I immediately fell in love I wish I would have ordered more...... the onions and lettuce was fresh as well .....I don't think I have had shrimp tacos that were that good in a long time.......the tamales were good I wish it had more sauce on them but not too bad......they also came with olives on them which were pretty good. Overall I give this place a 4.......definitely worth coming back for a night out with the ladies for some good food and awesome drinks! If you are near Nellis AFB you surely have to try this place out!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food on this side of town.  The Pescado Eufimio Zapata has a wine based sauce, with Spanish olives, that is the best I've ever had.  They also have decent priced lunch specials on weekdays."}
{"text":"I love this place. Awesome atmosphere, there was a guy playing guitar in the entrance. The steaks are always good, good quality and they are served with a bunch of sides that are just delicious. Big portions, you are def not gonna get out of there hungry. Fair prices.  Last time i went there i ordered the steak burracho, includes 2-3 sides and included in the price you get tortillas. All this for $18. Service is phenomenal the waiters are always nice and the cips with salsa and bean sauce are just amazing :)  If you end up in North Las Vegas do yourself a favor and stop there!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the items they had here. for lunch there are numorous specials. I had the table side guacamole and nachos. the guacamole was worth it. I will for sure be back. the service was gracious and the place was packed."}
{"text":"The food is great pero watch for the outrageous up sale on margaritas. Seriously, $25 for a margarita?  Talk about rip off!! When asked he chuckled, wow! This is one time that I was the tonto gringo. That part of this family business just sucks. I think that banner with \"best in LV \"dates back to 2012 for a reason. Guess that's why the banner is still up."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST Mexican food I've ever eaten! Margaritas were awesome too. Happy Hour 2 for 1"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, outstanding food,  interesting location.  This is a very good Mexican restaurant that caters to old and young alike.  Their dishes are all made from scratch and, though I've only tried the chimichanga, I would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the service was better than amaZing. Can't go wrong with some live Mexican music!"}
{"text":"Amazing Authentic Mexican Food. Eat here every time I visit Nellis AFB Quality & Price right on. Great service and ambiance. Gracie is great behind the bar, always friendly and attentive. Greet you with their signature Chips, Salsa & Beans to start. Never disappoints. I highly recommend the #1 Combo. Good Job Team..Viva Zapata's...."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and inviting but they use fake chicken or canned chicken it's not fresh. I personally think it is disgusting chicken even though the rest of the food is wonderful"}
{"text":"I love this place before you get seated they give you warm beans dip...  chips and salsa ...and warm tomato soup.  I'm nearly feel before I even order anything off the menu. The table side fresh avocado made in front of you is amazing... love that stuff like homemade."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Accidently came upon Zapatas.  What a great Vegas Find!  Food was delicious, service was top notch, and the margarita was yummy!  Some dishes were a little pricy, but you get what you pay for!!  Definiately a repeat visit next time Im in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Ambience and Food. Must have is their Guacamole which is prepared right in front of your eyes. Horchata is another speciality. If you feel Salsa is less spicy, ask for Habanero Sauce. There are 3 Vegetarian dishes available too, though you can also customise their other items to be without meat.The freshly prepared warm Taco Shells and Burrito Wraps, just amazing. Must go place for Mexican Food lovers! The con is the waiting time in evening and slightly pricier menu."}
{"text":"This place is always consistant with good tasty food. Now all my family goes there. Service, atmosphere, food, WOW! SO good, will return."}
{"text":"Since Dora Maria's closed down just down the road, those of us on Nellis craving good Mexican food had to find a new place to go.  Well, Viva Zapatas does not dissappoint at all.  I have tried about 10 different dishes and they all have been outstanding.    My personal favorite has got to be the chicken chimichanga (enchilada style).  Everything they prepare is fresh, and awesome.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Other yelpers will disagree, but I think this is the best Mexican restaurant in town. The food, decor, and service are all top notch.  I love the little things about this restaurant. Guacamole is made table side, tortillas are crispy yet chewy, chicken breasts are butterflied, and the salsa is spicy without being overwhelming. Everything adds up to create an enjoyable dining experience.  Of particular note is the mole. It is smooth, rich, complex, and somewhat spicy. The mole is so layered that it is impossible to discern all of the ingredients. However, they blend and play with each other to create something that is close to magic.  For a nice low calorie treat that's sure to delight your Vegan friends, try the Quesa Fundido con Rajas. Ok, so it's not low calorie. But you really should try it at least once a year. The hot cheese wrapped in chewy tortillas is beyond words.  One of my favorite parts about Zapatas is that it is a community restaurant. I always see people in uniform here, whether they are from the police department or Nellis. People meet here after work, come here on dates, and bring their families. We always bring our out of town guests here.   I can't say enough good things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here not expecting much since it's hard to find good Mexican food in town. Boy was I surprised. I ordered a pitcher of margaritas and was surprised how much we got for the money. Then my food was enchiladas. They tasted just like mom's (don't tell her I said that). The service at this place was excellent. Our server Jorge was all over it and we wanted for nothing. The only negative I would say is its really dark in there and at times hard to see the menu. We just busted out our cell phone lights and looked at the menu that way. Go to this place its good!"}
{"text":"Do: get the table side guacamole, al pastor taco, carne asada con rajas y crema tacos  Skip: margarita, Chile relleno"}
{"text":"Good food. I like to take a friend who knows Mexican food and he orders for me. Service from the drink servers is better than the waiter. One was so excellent I contributed to him directly. When I went alone with the kids, my waiter looked like he had no patience for us. We do not speak Spanish and he treated us like outsiders. I needed help with the menu because it is dark in there and it is hard to read. He was no place around to help. When the waiter finally did come around, he still acted like we were bothering him. So I suggest to take a Spanish speaking person with you when you go. It is too bad for the waiter but the food is good. The prices are on the high side. Minimum $10 for appetizers dinner plates run $15 to $30 a plate."}
{"text":"Their chile relleno was very good, the chips and salsa were good but the pork taco was dry and lacking flavor as was the tamale. One out of three on the main course is not good but the chile relleno was good enough I would go back for that alone. The service was great in the bar area and the beer was cold. I ate at three Mexican restaurants while in Vegas and this was the best. The other two had dry pork as well on their tacos so maybe that is the way they like it in Vegas?!?"}
{"text":"There is fast food Mexican food.  There is authentic Mexican food.  Then there is really good authentic Mexican food, and that is what you will get at Viva Zapatas.  The food here is superb.  I adore this place.  They should open a restaurant in SoCal, too!  I stopped here again today on my way home.  Awesome as always."}
{"text":"I asked my local friends to pick a place that locals like.  This is where they chose to take us.    We are used to the Nashville Mexican Food, and this place certainly was so much better than I am used to.  The ambiance was fabulous, with authentic live Mexican music.  Service was prompt and friendly, with generous portions of Nachos.  As an exciting addition to what I'm used to, they include Beans as well as Salsa!  For my entree I had the Tierra Libertad, which was delicious.  They also give you Tortilla, but they are quite large, and I was not really sure HOW you were supposed to eat the meal with the Tortilla.  I would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Viva Zapatas it feels like home they really know how to provide the best customer service. My favorite dish is pollo zarandeado and ceviche it is delicious you gotta to try it..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the bean dip, soup, and steak dish for dinner last evening. I think everything on this menu would be tasty. This is the second time I have dined here and will be back.  The service was very good and a little of live music in the background.  F"}
{"text":"I am so in love with this place. It is the best sit down Mexican restaurant I've been to here. Great service!Being your appetite, you will need it."}
{"text":"The best Mexican Iv'e had to date. YES, even better than Super Mex. Fundido w/ green chile KILLER! Awesome service. Homemade tortillas. Table side guacamole. Real classy place!"}
{"text":"Great food with big portions definitely a good choice. They have plenty of food choices. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you - next to a gas station & truck stop in NLV - reveals a gem of  restaurant. We came around 1pm for late lunch and we were seated in no time at all. Menu is extensive so it took a while to decide on the Carne ala Coca Cola and Mole Poblano for our entrées. While waiting for our food, we nibbled on what seemed like endless tortilla chips, salsa, and bean dip. They had a musician play live music and that definitely lent to a more relaxed atmosphere. Food was very good and we were thankful that we didn't order an appetizer because the portions are fairly large although the table side guacamole was tempting (next time!).  We will definite be back!"}
{"text":"There is always a waiting list in the evening but it's always worth it! The food, the service and the atmosphere are great. Tortillas are home made right there. Guacamole is super fresh."}
{"text":"Lighting was really poor, menu description really small, thank goodness for flashlight app. Filled up a little to much on chips and salsa. First brought out soup that was good but all it was is broth. Service slow but they did stop by our table to ask if everything was OK. Good was good, I had Chili Colorado and it was cooked perfectly. I would recommend it if you on that side of town."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic food.   Cozy atmosphere.  Nice live music.  Service cannot be beat!  Highly recommend for lunch or dinner.  Only suggestion is come early, parking is tight  & seats fill fast!"}
{"text":"Unfreakin believable. I give this place a \"6\" out of 5 stars ! Service was spot on excellent. Food was amazing. Had the \" Coca Cola sauce Pasilla Chilies Rib Eye steak, cooked perfectly medium rare. \"  It was so tender and flavorful, that I almost ordered another meal to go. Jorge was my waiter and he was one of the best waiters I have ever had, anywhere. Hats off to this family run Mexican gem of a restaurant. Do yourself a treat and visit this establishment. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal of Mexican food. Super tasty everything cooked fresh and a tortillas was amazingly soft and flaky.. There was a slight wait in time, but it was well worth it, don't miss out on some great Food. I was super happy and could not finish the portions served.  Find your happiness here."}
{"text":"In Love again! I asked around for a good romantic place to take a date. The name Viva Zapata's kept coming up by friends recommending it. The name didn't sound very romantic, it sounded more revolutionary, but maybe that's what I needed some kind of revolution in my life since nothing else was working out, So I decided to give it a try.   We agreed to meet there at eight, but I got there at seven, I didn't want to be late  and I wanted to get a feel of the place and make sure it met my expectations. As i walked in i knew i would like the place, nice decor dim lighting and live music. I proceeded to the bar and ordered a margarita and listened to the guitar man play someone Else's life with his fingers.  it was a really good margarita it actually had tequila in it. The bartender brought some complimentary chips and salsa and some bean dip. I didn't want to start eating since my date hadn't arrived yet, but one chip loaded with bean dip wouldn't hurt. After two bowls of chips and bean dip and three margaritas I decided to order an appetizer, Something light, so I ordered the seviche and let me tell you, it was the best seviche I have tried this far from the ocean, it couldn't be any fresher or tastier. It was soo good I decided to stick with the mariscos (seafood) and ordered the camarones borrachos, (like me)  Shrimp sauteed with garlic, spices and tequila, the perfect combination. You just can't go wrong with that, It was out of this world goodness!  All in all I had a wonderful time.  When you get caught between great food, a nice romantic ambiance and a guitar, you can't help  It but to fall in love. ....My date? Didn't make it.....But I fell in love nonetheless..... with the food at Viva Zapata's.                                                   PS.  Don't text and drive. You don't want to miss dinner!"}
{"text":"I only ate three bites of my entree. Must have been terrible right?! Nope. It was the most glorious plate of Mexican goodness I've encountered in as long as I can reliably recall. The chili verde pork was perfection. The chile relleno bursting with flavor. The guacamole, out of this world.   It was the chorizo queso that did me in before I ever set eyes on my meal. A dish full of cheesy chorizo served with homemade tortillas made about 4 feet from our table.   Also, the best damn margarita I've ever had in my life. Did I mention the homemade tortillas?! Still fresh and warm.   Ask for Nohemi, she rocks!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in two years. I got the steak fajitas and my husband got the flautas with chicken. Chips are great. Tortillas are super fresh."}
{"text":"Not recommended. After eating 3/4 of the bowl of chips and dip we found a cherry stem. When we brought it to their attention the manager came over and accused us of putting it in there. You know how I rebuttable.  I will not eat there again and not recommend it."}
{"text":"Having lived in Southern CA and dining with my son's Mexican family for the past 7 years, I would rate Viva Zapatas as one of the best authentic Southwest Mexican restaurants in town.  I don't know what Texican food is like, but from Santa Fe west, this ranks top in my book.  And...they serve real micheladas!  If you haven't had one, try it!  I drive across town just for this food."}
{"text":"first off the service was okay. didn't feel welcome and the waiter was not too attentive considering it wasn't crowded at all.  the other staff made sure our chips and water was refilled.    salsa was okay and bean dip was pretty good.  they make homemade tortillas so it was interesting watching the lady make them.  the food was okay.  being from california and spoiled it definitely wasn't the best.  i probably won't be going back and will try to find another one here in las vegas to curb my authentic mexican cravings."}
{"text":"Good relax environment. Good mole. Worth the trip. Been here twice on separate occasions. One with happy hour. Good service, good food, and authentic music."}
{"text":"Five star Guacamole!!!  They prepare it so awsome right next to your table, fresh as can be... My daughter loves avacado , so if the kids are into it, it's a  winner no matter what... Theres a guy who plays his guitar  & it makes for great atmo..."}
{"text":"An Ok Mexican Restaurant SLOW Service. Food not as authentic as hoped for."}
{"text":"Two words... Ensalada Marinera.  Two hollowed Avocado shells filled with Avocado, fresh salsa, Shrimp, Lettuce, Cheese, served a side of crackers lime and hot sauce.  I find this to be filling but not as overwhelming as a Coctel De Camarones.  (Shrimp Cocktail).    Also, they serve you chips and hot sauce AND refried beans... mmmm that's a first.  This is my first visit to this North Las Vegas Gem.  I was highly impressed with the food quality and service.     Please keep in mind that this review comes from a Mexican Native (from the state of Jalisco) so I you can rest assured I know a thing or two about Mexican cuisine. =P"}
{"text":"Great place for the entire family. The menu, though only Mexican food, was broad enough to deliver satisfaction even to the picky eaters. I had a Carne Asada dish and  it was spectacular. The meat was tender and very well seasoned. the environment inside the restaurant was quite enjoyable. The decoration is very traditional and cultural. The service was impeccable as well. The food was delivered relatively promptly considering it is made to order. The dishes didn't seem rushed. Each dish was carefully and cleanly served. I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants an authentic Mexican taste."}
{"text":"Food was fine aside from all the fat & bones and minimal meat I received (I ordered birria). I had to ask for another drink and my husband didn't even get asked if he needed another drink... will probably not be coming back!"}
{"text":"Primera y ultima vez q vengo, me recomendaron la campechana y q mala estaba, parece q estas comiendo pure de tomate con camaron... El servicio es muy bueno, aunq la comida tarda mucho en llegar a pesar de q no hay muchos clientes. Q decepcion no cuentan con rica comida mexicana"}
{"text":"Good food, fresh tortillas! Busy on weekends, and a favorite of several military families I know from the nearby AFB. Great staff. The only weird thing is how dark it is. I had a hard time reading the menu and we had to pull out the phone flashlight. Other tables followed suit. It would be hard for someone to see who is visually impaired."}
{"text":"Holy authentic! I think my search for authentic Mexican food is officially over!   Their chips are super addicting, we ate two whole baskets. Comes with a side of the normal spicy and bean dip (mixture of both is amazing!)   I love the decor in this place with the colorful paper banners everywhere.   Got the usual Chile Verde (= lean pork stewed in green chile sauce) and it was extremely tasty and full of flavor.  Probably the best I've ever tasted, just because it really tasted like it had been marinated and then stewed in the chile verde. They brought it out piping hot with the normal sides of spanish rice and refried beans.  The el burro burrito was massive! Way bigger than an over-stuffed chipotle burrito, so for $9.99 you definitely get your money's worth.  Each of the meals came with Fideo which is like a pasta/tomato soup. I thought it was okay, not really for me. It was more like a watered down version of stringy spaghetti O's to me.   Service was awesome. The minute my glass of water went empty, they topped it off right away. They even pack your left over food at your table, so you're not left alone trying to pack it yourself.   I will def come back when I get a craving for some real good chile verde."}
{"text":"Since moving from Texas to Vegas, we have been craving good Mexican restaurant.  Unfortunately, Viva Zapatas didn't meet our expectations.  First, they got our to go order wrong. We ordered beef fajitas and they gave us chicken fajitas.  In addition, the chicken was over cooked and dry.   They also charge you extra for chips and salsa.  Their salsa has an odd smoky vinegar taste.  Lastly, the guacamole that comes with the other meal tasted like it came out of a can. The best part when we called to let them know about the mistake, they told us they do not offer beef fajitas???  Will not be returning.  We always count on Yelp for recommendations but this was a big fail.  Trying to figure out how they got so many good reviews."}
{"text":"This was my kind of place.  My family loved it.  I'll definitely be back because of the food, ambience, and wait staff.  I'm sorry to say that the only thing/person that sucked was the Hostess last night (04/21/2018) whom is the first person that is supposed to greet you and make you feel welcomed upon your arrival.    Not only was she not welcoming but she was straight out rude!  I don't know, maybe she was having a bad day because there's no way someone could be that rude in that position."}
{"text":"I've been here two times so far this year. Both times I was not disappointed. I'll share my most recent experience. Came today about lunch time. Promptly seated. Chips, beans, and ridiculously good salsa shop up at the table right after being seated. drink order taken immediately. Their staff worked together to keep us happy. Our drinks never saw the bottom of the cup. I appreciated that because there's nothing more annoying than the wait staff letting your cup sit empty while your trying to wash down your meal.   I had the carnitas fajitas with corn tortilla. These were THE BEST carnitas I have had in my life this far. Incredible flavor! My bf had shredded beef tacos with the crunch shell. He really enjoyed it.   They also have a little station in the corner of the restaurant where they have a lady making fresh flour and corn tortillas. I haven't tried the flour so I can't comment on those. But the corn tortillas are amazing too. The best.   I look forward to visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I go at least once a week, the food is always good and the staff always friendly. Parking can sometimes be a pain but the staff and food make up for that."}
{"text":"Top notch!! Everything on the menu is amazing and they make homemade tortillas like in Mexico in the corner of the restaurant. The design of the place is unique and very awesome to look at."}
{"text":"Just like the reviews, they have a live Mexican music here. Service at bar was quick. Good bean dip, good salsa and good chips. Maybe it's because I came on a week day, but it was not busy here today which was good for me and the rest of the customers. I ordered the fish tacos deep fried and they wee delicious. I will come back here again and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"I got the carne Asada plate I believe and it was way too bland for me. But if you add salt and pepper it was a lot better!"}
{"text":"Ambiance:  The restaurant is in the east side of Vegas , on Craig. The decor reminds of old Mexico implying the food is authentic. Since its Halloween, the decor was based on their dia de muerte festival.   Service: Service was wonderful, the waiters knew the food well and gave me good recommendations based on the preferred protein that I wanted. The waiter was attentive to our needs.  Food: Food was great, the complimentary nachos with the salsa and refried beans were really good. Expect to keep on munching on the nachos while waiting for the entrees. The salsa had a good roasted tomato taste with spice that keeps you eating the nachos! The entree that I had was grilled chicken and it tasted great. Plus the freshly made flour tortillas made the dining experience better.  Overall: I would definitely come back to try the other entrees, dining experience is great and the quality of the food is very good , the nachos is a definite bonus. Next time I want to try this restaurant for dinner with the family this time."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were great. Server was very courteous. The only issue we has is that one of our left over plates was taken to be boxed up but it never was. The server took it and tossed it. He was very apologetic but it was not right. If it was any inexpensive food it would have been ok but it was shrimp!!"}
{"text":"One of the best dine in Mexican restaurants where the food is actually good. I've been here plenty of times and ordered different dishes. This time I had the steak cilantro which is bomb!!! The green salsa is really good! I ordered it medium rare and it was perfect! Super soft and flavorful. The tortillas are hand made on the spot! Also I'd recommend the \"gordito de camaron\" from the appetizers. Pretty much a burrito cut in 3 with shrimp and tons of melted cheese. Other dishes I've had are filete relleno and the bacon wrapped shrimp. All good! The service is on point. Only thing would be the parking. Limited very crammed space. Other than that, no complaints!!"}
{"text":"Took forever to take our order.   Even longer to get our food. They do not have queso dip. Probably because this place is very authentic.   Not a big deal to me but my boys said this place is off the list."}
{"text":"well i used to enjoy the food but every time my wife and i visit this restaurant it gets worse and worse and i dont want to risk how bad the next visit will be....well the main problem i had was a mexican restaurant put canned jalapenos on the nachos and had ballpark cheese......gross"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for Mother's Day. the wait staff & support was amazing. I had Sangria which was amazing , taco, tostada, & chicken enchlida which were all amazing.I have been looking for a great Mexican Restaurant & this far surpassed my expectations. this place is amazing. also, try the bean dips.....delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the every day menu items of Chilis or the like,  this isn't the place for you.  But, if you are looking for a small restaurant that serves authentic Mexican dishes ... this place is a \"Must\"!  Are they sitting you in 5 minutes? No.  Do you get your drink or meal within 2 minutes of ordering? No.  Are you in a rush and looking for something prepared by a line cook? Then don't go here.  This is a medium sized restaurant with great atmosphere (there was a live entertainer when we were there). Sit at the bar or a table... Both are perfect! We started with the fresh guacamole.  My Hubs had the Burria de Chivo and I finally decided on the Pollo de Conac. Everything was delicious! The service was good (yes, a little slow... but we were not putting out any fires....) and the wait staff was friendly.  Would definitely return to this spot! Great job!"}
{"text":"Love This Place.. Food Is Excellent n Service Is Great.. i Dont Have a Bad Thing To Say About This Place.. Waiter's Alex and Jose Were The Bomb.. I Highly Recommend This Place.."}
{"text":"I was so glad to stumble on to this place!  This Mexican Eatery has been here for about 16 years, so not sure how we did not know of this place.  As soon as you park your car you can already sniff out some wonderful aromas.    Upon entering you are greeted and your eyes will immediately start admiring some of the Mexican Revolution pieces placed throughout the restaurant.  Totally transports you to that era.  Just awesome! There are also 2 ladies making fresh tortillas.    We were seated and immediately greeted with some chips accompanied by salsa and warm refried beans.   The salsa was not great but the beans were very tasty. I knew I wanted to try their Menudo but I am always hesitant to try Menudo anywhere but home since it can be horribly executed at times. But I took my chances and I was so glad I did.  It was delicious and came with fresh made corn and flour tortillas and all the little condiments that make this dish alone something I would come back for.  The bowl is very big and I definitely took some home. It may seem a little steep at $12 but it really is a meal all on its own.  I also sampled some of my husband's combo which consisted of a beef tamale, enchilada, chile relleno with beans and rice and a side order of an asada taco.   The tamale had good flavor but was a little on the dense side, the enchilada was very tasty as well as the chile relleno but the taco was horrible, beans and rice were nice.   For dessert we were recommended their Fried Ice Cream, I am not usually a fan of if anywhere else but we opted to try especially since they were sold out of their flan. It was actually really good but I would not call it Fried Ice Cream, it was more like a round ball of vanilla ice cream coated with some cinnamon toast crunch and coconut flakes.  Still was very tasty.   Service was excellent and overall very nice place I will definitely try this place again and maybe try some their amazing looking drinks we saw leaving their bar to accompany my Menudo. Salud!"}
{"text":"Such a cute, quaint atmosphere! Great food! My boyfriend & I tend to over order in case we don't like something. Everything was terrific! We are oh so stuffed & will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"we have been coming here for years.  we bring our children and they love the live music.  the service is always good.  i will warn you, it is easy to fill up on chips, salsa, and beans before the food comes."}
{"text":"Yummmmm. Love their salsa and food. Always our go to place in Vegas for Mexican food. Haven't found any place that's better out here."}
{"text":"This was my first visit as I've heard great things about this being one of the few great places to eat Mexican food and I wasn't disappointed.  One thing I always find that's a hallmark of a great restaurant is great service from being greeted at the door to when you sit down and how you're attended during your meal and Viva Zapata was all those things and attentive to my drink, chips, salsa, and bean dip.  I just want to mention that bean dip with chips is something few places offer but always wins me over in a Mexican restaurant.   I ordered the Torta de Pierna which is a pork sandwich that came out with some time that shows it wasn't just heated up and made with care.  The bread was perfectly toasted and the meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful.   I didn't feel a hot plate nor was warned about one and that's something that always makes me feel great before a bite.    I'm looking forward to future visits and trying more plates from this place due to the food, service, and overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. We ordered the guacamole and it was fabulous! Prepared at the table with all the fixings! Food was wonderful and staff was great! Jesus took good care of us!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place for a birthday celebration. I told the waiter several times it was my sister birthday and they were supposed to sing for her and they didnt. The food was good it just took a bit for the food to come out."}
{"text":"Amazing mexican joint with homemade goodies. Had the fresh guacamole and the Menudo soup... wow just awesome great find near the LV office."}
{"text":"Since I have to eat healthier, we've been careful of the places we've been picking (Especially when we're on the road). I have been coming here for years and I have to APOLOGIZE, I haven't mention this eatery until now. The staff here has always been friendly and bring you chips and two stone bowls with salsa as soon as you're seated.  One is a warm bean dip which is creamy and warm and the other is a finely ground tomato based salsa.  Viva Zapatas do have healthier dishes on their menu, but they are not \"flagged\" as such.  My favorite dish here is named after the owner's Grandmother, so you know it has to be good and it's on the healthy side.  It is called, Pollo Estilo \"Abuelita Magdalena\", which is two Grilled Chicken breast simmered in olive oil, fresh lime juice, garlic, oregano and yellow peppers.  The chicken is flavorful and kept moist from the cooking process.  The plate is also shared with rice, guacamole and beans.  Every time we have to go to Nellis Air Force base/North Las Vegas, we always stop by Zapatas for a meal (my wife says the Margarita's are good, too)!"}
{"text":"Consistently amazing service and food. Table side guacamole, delicious shrimp dishes and 5 star service. And the homemade tortillas to die for. Jesus was our excellent waiter."}
{"text":"Authentic, flavorful and delicious. I love that they have items on their menu that you can't find in most Mexican restaurants. I also loved the handmade flour tortillas. I believe every entree comes with a side of soup, which I really enjoyed. My friend ordered one of the carne asada plates. The one broiled in lemon juice and spices... sooo good. I had the shrimp that was cooked with a mayonnaise-based sauce. It's good if you like mayo lol! Very different but definitely good. Oh and Did I mention fee chips, salsa, and bean dip? All of which tasted really good. Lastly, the ambience inside has a certain charm and warmth, which is inviting. I'll be coming back here time and time again."}
{"text":"Real Mexican authentic food. (Trust me I know I'm Mexican and cook it all the time) first of all the customer service is wonderful. I can see why they are always busy. (I drive all the way from summerlin just to eat here) I love the atmosphere and feel like I'm at my tias house in Mexico or something. The chips, salsa and beans are always fresh and they are free. Their on tap beers and Margaritas are always top shelf and super fresh. You get free soupa too. The food is hot and very reasonable pricing. Love it here. Like I said I drive all the way from summerlin just to eat here. Oh yea, there is always live music as well."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food and AMAZING service. Our waitress was extremely friendly and thoughful throughout the whole meal. And the Margaritas are also extremely good. We managed to get there just in time for their 2 for 1 happy hour deal. Love this place and will come again."}
{"text":"Yum! We went here for my boyfriends birthday! and the food was amazing. They even sang him happy birthday with live guitar and it really felt like a FIESTA!"}
{"text":"Tried this place the other day and had the green Chili and pork burrito combo (Uno on the lunch specials).  The portion was a good size and it is served with rice and beans.  They also serve chips with bean dip and salsa while you wait for your order.  This is going to be my go to Mexican restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. Talk about delicious food. Even my mom who 1. Hates food 2. Likes chicken mole 3. Is a Texan so lives off Mexican food, fell in love with this place. She said she hasn't found Molé that tasted that good since the 70s. The food is always fresh and timely. The staff makes you feel important and the chips and dips are mind blowing. Fresh tortillas are bomb. Atmospheres and love music is fantastic and everything Ive tried more than suites my fancy. Will be coming back for years to come."}
{"text":"Their 25 minute wait turned out to be an hour and 20 minute wait. We come here often and love the food and especially the margaritas but tonite is just ridiculous.   Sorry Zapatas I'm not sure if we'll be back.  And did I mention that the margarita was very weak?  I think the bartender forgot the tequila.  *sigh*"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Not too pricey and so much food. Tacos are amazing and they make the guacamole in front of you."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to come to this restaurant on a weekend trip in Vegas. While in North Vegas I searched for good Mexican food and saw the amount of reviews in the amount of stars at this restaurant had received. I can honestly tell you that it may have been low in regards to star quantity! This Mexican restaurant was absolutely amazing and the staff is great but I think the most impressive part of this restaurant is how clean it was. If you ever find yourself near this restaurant you owe it to yourself, considering the prices, to come in and experience it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Ordered chilaquiles with steak and she ordered a steak lunch. The salsa was ok, but the guacamole was the best you have to come and try their guacamole. We sat right by the tortilla lady so that was cool we got to see her do work. Clapping it up lol which made me feel like I was at home. The tequila shots were good and the service was ok. I definitely would come back to experience more of this gem."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I have been going here for years and years and just haven't gotten around to post a review.  The fideo soup, the homemade chips and salsa, the steak, the burritos, tacos... Anything I have ever had is DELISH.  Very nice bar area as well as dine in area for kids.  Sometimes there is a live mariachi man playing as well.  Great place to go for big family dinners, or on a date :-) Love it ask for the chips and salsa at the table and they are free!"}
{"text":"I've had my share of good Mexican food but this place hands down great food great atmosphere great service I will be coming back"}
{"text":"We come here once a month or so and are never disappointed. Service is good and employees are friendly. Ordered the shrimp quesadilla for an appetizer and it was delicious. Cobb salad for dinner. Another delicious meal!"}
{"text":"this place was awesome! First trip there yesterday will definitely go back. The entire staff, from the hostess at the front, to the servers and bussers, everyone was super friendly and made sure we were enjoying our meal. The tortillas are so fresh, u can see them being made in house at the back of the restaurant.  Also had live music. I order the Enchiladas de Mole (sp?) and hubby got fajitas. At first the prices seemed a little high, but when the food came out we found out why. The portions were large and the food was excellent. My enchiladas were just cheese but the mole sauce was delicious. Came with grilled chicken on top, side of rice & beans and yummy soup. Hubby fajita meat was seasoned well. Only came with 2 tortillas to rap but when he asked for more, they came out hot and fresh.  Only downside to this place is the parking. It's behind a gas station so the parking is very limited."}
{"text":"This place was great. I had the chicken enchilada lunch special and my daughter had the beef and bean burritos special. The value fit the cost and the atmosphere was comforting. We will definitely be going back, hopefully soon, with a larger party."}
{"text":"Location is bad at bad neighborhood but the food and atmosphere is wonderful. I visit as family dinner, their fideo soup is the best in town, their music at the location by real musician is real good. Proper dimmed light with nice Mexican atmosphere. Some dinner time we have to wait 10-15 min, but now we know better time without wait.   We always get combo menus, my option is set with Relleno and Cheese Enchilada. 1 out of 10 comes with super seedy-Relleno, but 9 out of 10 comes proper sized pepper with full of cheese. Whenever we want Cheesy night with beautiful crisp chips and Fideo soup, we drive 30 min and go and eat. The best in town after 7 years of trying most of Mexican Restaurant"}
{"text":"We stopped in after going to the speedway and we were starved. This cute little restaurant was just perfect for our hungry tummies! We ordered the beef flautas and the shrimp fajitas and they were brought out sizzling and tasted great! Service was good and fast. Well worth it. Chips and salsa were yummy too!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this hidden gem spending the night in NLV passing through town. The menu has a ton of offerings and made it difficult to narrow down what to order.  The chips with bean dip and salsa were a first and really good too! Drink specials including beer and cocktails made with their house tequila were great.  I ordered the Carne Asada \"Villa\" and have to say it was the best I've had. Keep in mind I've ordered this plate all over LA, OC and SD and none compare to Viva Zapatas. The steak was seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection!   If you're in NLV, do yourself a favor and eat here!"}
{"text":"Large menu selection! There's a veggie section, huevos, chicken, shrimp, other parts of animals I'd rather not eat. Pretty hard not to find something you want.   FOOD Complimentary Chips and salsa (3.5 stars): Come with a bean dip and a salsa dip. I liked the bean dip more.   Soup that comes with meal (3 stars): Pretty good actually. Noodles inside were good. Broth is like a tomato chicken broth.    Guacamole (3.5 stars): Good guac but I've had better.    Shrimp fajitas (3 stars): Shrimp were way overcooked, pretty chewy. Rice and beans were good. They have hand made tortillas, which were okay. I used to live in SD where there are tons of Mexican restaurants that do hand made tortillas and they taste so much better.   Complimentary Birthday Churros (2 stars): Not very soft. Caramel sauce wasn't so great with it either. Nice of them to give something for birthdays though! But these churros are on the regular dessert menu also, wouldn't recommend them. They also sing to you and put a sombrero on you for your birthday.   SERVICE (5 stars):  Our server was awesome. On top of everything we asked for. Waters were always getting filled. And once we told him there were vegetarians in the group he made sure to tell them what they could and couldn't eat.   ATMOSPHERE (3.5 stars): Place isn't that big but it's a good size, make reservations if u can, it was packed when we go there but we had reservations.    PARKING: Parking is tight. The lot is weird so it takes a while to get in some of the spots.   Overall if you need to go to some kind of restaurant around this area it works. But nothing spectacular. If you have a big group they do a good job with service."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food 100. Try the shrimp juice margarita to die for. Ate a mocateje bowl with friends and had to agree it was the best. Everything is fresh and tasty, not tasteless. Highly recommend and not pricey. The restaurant is not big inside and the later you go you might wait a bit. The wait is worth the great food."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here. I love the beans and salsa they bring to the table. I've had several dishes and have never been unhappy worth any of them.  It's a little but pricey, but you get a lot for your money.   I loved the live music when we were there last.  I've always had great servers that offer suggestions and are accommodating."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant, fresh tortillas being made daily. This place has a good menu for seafood that makes it a great spot to visit. Prices for dinner are good, but you have to check out their lunch menu, incredible deal. Overall, the best part is the waiters in the restaurant, incredible service and you can bet on never having to wait for drink refills."}
{"text":"First time at this establishment, I was very pleased with the service and the food. I came into town for work and met up with some old friends who brought me here for dinner on Sunday night. The place was very busy but we were seated promptly upon arrival. Chips and salsa were brought to the table immediately after we were seated and the waiter came very soon after to take our drink order. The drinks came out quickly and were very cold. I ordered the Carne la Tampiquena and the New York strip was absolutely delicious! Cooked to perfection and as good or better than most steak houses I've ever been to. We also had fresh guacamole made tableside for us and it was very fresh and delicious. Three dinners and four beers for only 82 bucks? almost unbelievable. We were thank graciously by our host upon our departure. Keep up the good work! I will come here again when I visit Vegas next time."}
{"text":"I like the food here, sometimes the service lags a bit.  The parking is rough.  The menu is very extensive and make a choice quite difficult.  The locations is far, but worth it.  I love the avocado shrimp salad, very fresh.  They prepare guacamole at your table and it's good.  There is a lot to explore on this menu.  As mentioned before the chips and tortillas are fresh.  I'm looking forward to trying their cactus appetizer.  When you are leaving don't forget to get a mint, yum.  I pondered over what they were and finally asked.  Key lime after dinner mints."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and something was just off this last visit. We arrived at 5pm on a Tuesday expecting a large dinner crowd and the place was empty and we were wondering why. The food was good like normal but it literally took 30 minutes for it to arrive at the table from the time we actually ordered. The place was empty but the service was horrible. And then to top it off the waiter hit my 3 year old son on the head with a water glass that he was refilling. Not a bump but an actual thump that we all heard."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Huevos rancheros are to die for! Mini sopes are real good also. Carne asada in them is so tasty. They start you with fideo soup. Which like noodle soup the Mexican version. We have been coming in the morning so not sure if they serve the soup all day. Honestly food here in las Vegas is amazing. So many hidden treasures. This is one of them. Moved from San Diego. California they aren't very many good authentic Mexican places. Not pricey either."}
{"text":"This was a great place to stop for lunch on the way to Utah from L.A.  It's just outside of all the traffic and hubbub of the city and it's got a huge selection of traditional Mexican comfort foods.  They make their own tortillas, which is always a plus.  The restaurant and bathrooms are clean and there is plenty of parking (at least, there was when I came for lunch).  A little more expensive than I had expected, but the food was good and the service was quick."}
{"text":"After a little over an hour stuffing snacks into plastic bags under Three Square's Backpacks program, my coworkers and I headed down the street to Viva Zapatas. Even though we showed up about 45 minutes early for our reservation, they already had our table ready and were happy to seat us!  The awesome staff never let our drinks get less than half full, which meant a lot of running around for them that did not go unappreciated. They brought out all ten of our orders at once, hot but not so hot that we couldn't dig in immediately. The salsa is fabulous here--it's hotter than most restaurants I've been to, and peppery to boot! LOTS of choices on the menu, plus a whole bunch of lunch specials.  The only downside I can think of is their squishy, uneven parking lot, but my boss managed to navigate it in his pick-up, so I guess it's not an issue.  Service is great, food is great, bathrooms are clean (check out the sinks!) Absolutely will be back next time I volunteer at Three Square. :)"}
{"text":"Cognac Steak was missing the flavor of this steak dish and we were highly disappointed. The Cocktail Camarones was really good and you can't go wrong with their excellent chips and dip. Overall it was hit and miss tonight."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very nice staff and beautiful live music. Very clean with a warm, cozy atmosphere. If this place were closer to my house, it would be my destination every time we go out to eat."}
{"text":"Horrible! Came here ONLY because of reviews...waited over 2 HOURS just to get our food! Not only that but they brought out the plates individually! By the time our whole parties food came out it was COLD! Mgmt was HORRIBLE, they literally argued with us regarding the cold food! Worst experience ever! Will NEVER, EVERRRR come here again!"}
{"text":"So delicious  yummy margaritas and soup and bean dip ! Ordered chill Colorado to be continued!"}
{"text":"Still the best!! Delicious food, bomb drinks, great service. What else can u ask for. Must try!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is conveniently down the street from Nellis Air Force Base, and although I wouldn't call it perfect mexican, the food was delicious. I had the carne asada and highly recommend it. It was tender, juicy, and cooked just right. The staff was really friendly but it seemed like they were shorthanded and it was fairly busy. All in all I'd definitely go back for the carne asada, however I wouldnt call it one of my top 5."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because my friends had told me how good it was. We got our chips, salsa and beans in a decent time. The salsa was WAY too salty and the beans tasted like shrimp. It took forever for a waiter to take our order. To the point where my friend had to go get someone. Once we finally got our order in we waited about 30 mins for our food. Our food had no tatse. We were there a total of 2 hours. You also have to pay for refills which we didnt know because the menu said nothing about it. My husband and I ended up spending $60. If we knew that we would be spending that kind of money it definitely wouldn't have been here."}
{"text":"The tamale was amazing, as was the large house margarita. The best part was the excellent and kind service!"}
{"text":"Mexican food is a love it or hate it outcome.  You have no choice but to LOVE absolutely everything about this place. Staff and service are excellence, very nice, polite, fast, just amazing! Everything we have ordered here has been so delicious! The guacamole is made in front of you and the chips and salsa also come with a bean dip that is great and I don't even like beans! The live music is fun and entertaining and not overwhelming. They have fresh homemade lemonade that is so refreshing. So clean and well taken care of. This place would get 6 stars if it was an option!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! No parking. There are literally less than 20 spots. We parked at the gas station next door. The wait was fast for a holiday. Service was a bit slow, they forgot one of our drinks. But what they lack in service, they make up in food!! Fresh tortilla makers behind a glass wall. Nice music. Great chips and salsa. Small place but my goodness worth coming back again for."}
{"text":"Excellent food! There was someone playing the guitar which really brought it home for me. Definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Good solid Mexican food.  a great lunch choice.  the lunch selection is on the back of the menu and its pretty good.  I get the number 6  I just bumped it up a star because another place i went too is so bad."}
{"text":"Whenever my husband is craving Mexican food, we head over to Viva Zapatas!  They are just as good as Lindo (if not better), but without the super high price.  The food is always great and they keep the homemade chips and salsa/bean dip coming.  If you order guac, they make it right at the table.  They usually offer a complimentary cup of soup as well.  What I really love about Zapatas is that they always accommodate my picky food needs and never make me feel badly about it.  The service is top notch!  They also have one of the best margaritas in Vegas!  They have a great happy hour from 2p.m.-6:00 p.m. (I think) M-F with 2 for 1 drinks - you can't beat it!  I love the live music every night and since they are located so close to the Galaxy Theater in the Cannery, it's the perfect date night restaurant too!  The restaurant is a bit hard to find since they are in the same lot as a gas station (if you are coming off of the Craig Rd. exit on 95 - turn towards Pecos Road and you can't miss it) but I promise, it's worth it!  Zapatas is definitely an Eastside hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Even though people thought it was pricey I had bacon wrapped shrimp $18 but it came with 8 shrimp well worth the money. The only bad thing is they don't have elote or I would never need to go anywhere else"}
{"text":"I used to love this joint, and don't get me wrong but the food is not quite as good as it used to be.  This all started about 1 year ago.  For example, the sopa de fideos does not have the noodles it used to have, and the overall flavor is not like it once was.  The dishes used to have a lot more zest, now they are just a little bland.  Still great food, but just not as good as it once was unfortunately.    Still very clean and great service by the staff."}
{"text":"This was a recommendation from a person we met at another restaurant and man it was amazing. The food was so good and the staff was so kind. Felt like a family atmosphere. Will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from my friends an my god this place is amazing from customer service to quality and quantity! This was my first time here with my brother... Most definitely I will be back with my kids they'd love this place.... AMAZING STAFF by the way smiling an happy to work THANK YOU VIVA ZAPATA'S you made my day much better"}
{"text":"came here a couple weeks ago with my fiancé, we got sat down right away (we beat the dinner rush) started us with happy hour - margaritas and the best bean dip and salsa. of course we killed right through those chips. he ordered the shrimp tacos and I ordered my favorite dish, chicken enchiladas with mole soooooo good! good ambience and great service, definitely will remember this place the next Time we go out for Mexican food."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good mole. I decided to switch the standards enchilada sauce for the home made mole (extra $2.00 charge) but was disappointed. The vegetarian enchiladas were not something to write home about. Normally the sauce, tortilla and the filling (steamed vegetables) come together over all I would not order this dish again. I've had much better vegetarian enchiladas in other restaurant. This plate was not cheap I was disappointed. The beans had a good home made taste but the Spanish rice was not properly cooked hard texture. The staff was really kind in celebrating in singing at my daughters birthday dinner. Thank you."}
{"text":"Camarones Sarandeados Estilo \"Cuautla\" oh what a dish! Although we have gone here several times this has to be my all time favorite! I tried this dish for the first time today and I was quite taken by surprise. When I saw the ingredients and it said, with a \"touch of mayonnaise\", I thought what could go wrong with mayonnaise? It was absolutely delicious!!! I love their sopa Fideo that they serve before your entree, it's like a little bowl of Mexican noodle soup, I cheat and crunch up some of my chips they give you with the bean dip, I love this place. The service is excellent, the food is delicious and I wish I lived closer. I rate this place 10 stars!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dried out, no flavor. Got carne asada tacos for lunch on a Monday around noon. The free chips and salsa are great, but the carne asada tacos I ordered were just chunks on meat in a warm tortilla. There was no seasoning and the meat was tough. There was supposed to be Pico de gallo  on top which turnout out to be 2 small flakes of tomato. No good."}
{"text":"Been in Las Vegas since 09' and my wife's coworkers drove from the base to check it out. She was pleased so I decided we would try it out together. The chips were nice and hot also very fresh. Bean dip is superb. The salsa they use is.....different. I like chunky salsa and spicy. This salsa isn't. But there food is good and always good portions. Glad to know this place is here.  I'll go back again!"}
{"text":"Slow service. I thought the food was kind of tasteless. I had to smother it in salsa to taste anything good."}
{"text":"Fideo soup is pretty good.  Their Carne Asada tacos are good along with their chips and salsa.  A bit over prices but it's worth it once in a while.  No fatty pieces of beef with the tacos."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in las vegas. Cool atmosphere, good prices, great food and cold beer. Chips, salsa and bean dip all you can eat. Tortillas are made fresh. Its a small place so always make sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time the other day. They have a great happy hour, it was buy one get on free drinks so my guest and i ordered a margarita and the waiter brought out 4. It was hard NOT to drink them since they were already on the table. Pretty thoughtful, since it started getting real busy after 6pm. I ordered the Cognac steak with the mushroom sauce, it was sooo good! Next time i want to try the Coca Cola steak, it sparked my curiosity."}
{"text":"Really nice ambiance and decent food. Fun, live singer. Staff is really quick and observant. Delicious flan!"}
{"text":"Good food and very nice Servers.  Fresh hand made Tortilla's.  only one downfall...HUGE bar taking up most of the room.  Small dining area.  Other than that....GREAT"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican restaurant!  The Good: The service was impeccable, unlike any Mexican restaurant Ive seen in the valley. The drinks were always refilled, the food was tasty and the servers were professional and polite, and tentative. The decor is awesome I couldnt stop looking around at all the cool shit they have on the walls. but it didnt seem that tacky.   The Bad: Nothing was really bad here. the Hostess was a little bland but Ive come to accept that from the valley and the food wasnt that great and it def isnt that cheap. I still dont understand how they do their pricing.    The Ugly: I would say the only ugly thing is the location. This restaurant has very little parking and it is out of the way in North Las Vegas, but im glad it exists."}
{"text":"Being from a Puerto Rican and Mexican family, I enjoy authentic Mexican food. Food here is great. Large menu with many choices and combo plates. Servers are quick to bring refills on chips, salsa, or drinks. My first time here was at dinner time and aside from the lighting not being that great, everything else was perfect. I felt just like family and welcomed by everyone working there. Being from CA, I have had many different types of Mexican food from numerous places. This place is definitely a go to when I'm craving Mexican food.  Only downfall in my opinion, which is why I did not give them 5 stars, is because of their parking lot situation. Very few spots to park in. Luckily my first time here it wasn't too busy. But the second time I came here, there were no spots and nearly had to battle someone else for an open spot when someone left.  Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"Two adults and a one-year-old looking for somewhere new (to us), found Viva Zapata's. We were there for late breakfast/early lunch. Seated promptly! The hostess took the drink orders and the waitress brought the drinks and a busser brought chips, salsa, and bean dip. Awesome teamwork! Everyone's timing was on point.  Allow me to point out: if you're craving chips and salsa, you can go to pretty much any old Mexican restaurant and get your fix. Viva Zapata's offers chips, salsa, bean dip, AND a fabulous fideo soup (it's basically tomato soup with short noodles; VZ's take on it is among the best I've had). Speaking of the soup, the busser brought out a cup of it for the toddler before our orders were even taken, which kept her busy and gave us time to look over the menu.  He had huevos rancheros and I had camarones deseados(?). Huevos rancheros came with pork (a little dry, but great flavor). Shrimp was incredible. Something different about their rice--I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's definitely a good thing."}
{"text":"Well we waited forever to be seated and then to be served...cognac chicken was divine...my daughter ordered that...so was the bean dip as other viewers have said...live music excellent as well...Stevie wonder in Spanish is a treat.  But my pork was off...not a little..a LOT...as in rancid spit it in the napkin felt like puking all night off.  So beware..."}
{"text":"So good! Service was amazing, food was excellent. Hand made tortillas.... Yum. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Me and my wife come here all the time for some good mexican food! They are like the fine dining of mexican food. The avocado appetizer is the best I've ever had at any mexican restaurant. Part of the reason its so good is the experience; they actually make the appetizer in front of you! Another good feature of this place is the live music. Theres an amazing guitar player/singer who sings a lot of classical mexican tunes. The reason I gave this a 4 out of 5 is due to the small and inconvenient parking lot, especially since they're usually always busy. Second, the last time we went there we were COMPLETELY ignored. We had to find the manager twice in order get our food ordered and delivered. 30 minute wait is unacceptable, especially when no one checks on you. That is what cost them a perfect score. Other than that, a very good meal awaits for you here."}
{"text":"This was some of the best Mexican food in Vegas!!! The salsa's were awesome, all 3 of them!!! I went there on a Saturday, busy but was seated fast!!! luckily~ The lowrider car club \"LAS VEGAS\" cc decided to end there cruise there as well so the whole parking lot filled up with old bombs!!!! and cool cars. The margarita was a fish bowl~ and the plate I had shredded beef tacos Was excellent... over all service was excellent,food and decor was a 4 star night****!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! And the handmade corn and flour tortillas! Always a good choice! I've been going to this place for over 10 years and I always have a good time and leave stuff! Great staff and customer service! A definitely go to spot.."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here tonight. Sorry that we didn't take any pictures of our meals. The food and drinks were delicious. Especially the Queso Condido con Chorizo. Our server Ramon was excellent, and so was Osmani. Will definitely be returning.  Good service, good food, good drinks = A GOOD TIME !!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but orders are incredibly slow. I placed a Togo order and it took them 40 min when then told me it would be 15-20 on the phone.  Also, they tried to charge me for the free drink that comes with the lunch special. Then they told me if you order to go then drinks aren't included and wouldn't give me the drinks. They don't state this anywhere on their menu! That's called false advertising."}
{"text":"Amazing service, table side Guacamole, home made tortillas that they recommend you eat butter with and are amazing, live music, waitress was so accommodating and nice especially since we looked a little bedraggled coming directly from the water slides. WOW!"}
{"text":"we have been coming to this fantastic place for more than 15 years..  they make the best  tamarindo and mescal margarita!! yum yum yum. hats off to lorenzo(manager) food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I love new experiences and was able to try some chipolte lengua (tongue). I was surprised at how mellow a texture the tongue was, but I definitely enjoyed it, though I would have liked to have tried a different sauce that it was cooked in. The waiter was very friendly, the hostess was cute, and the accompanying conversation from the table next to mine about some outlandish feat made for a good dining experience."}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant!  My husband orders enchilada dishes,  i explore the seafood menu.  We have never been disappointed.  The food is consistently great.  The service is great as well. My kids,  who are normally very finicky  with Mexican food,  go crazy for the food here. Atmosphere is amazing, due to the decor,  live music,  and cleanliness. Only issue is that our  family of five is sat in a booth made for four."}
{"text":"Great food great service always busy.  Tortilla lady is the cherry on top for a great Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Order the Prepriado! Micheladas are my favorite and they're delicious here!!  Foods always amazing!!  The lunch specials is a great deal about $10!  M-F 11-3. $4 tostada fills me up!!  Love love that they serve beans with fresh made chips and salsa!!  This is my toddlers lunch!!  The steak fajitas are a favorite!!  The seasoning is so flavorful and makes the onions and peppers super tasty!!  I've ordered them mixed but I prefer the steak!!  Service is always great and the food comes out in no time!"}
{"text":"We just happened to stumble across this place and I'm glad we did! We usually go to Leticias for awesome Mexican food but we didn't want to drive that far so when we came across Viva Zapatas, of course we had to try it out! The food is great, atmosphere is beautiful, and the staff is friendly. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"First of all, I live in Henderson and come to this place when I am craving authentic Mexican food. In other words, I travel about 30 minutes and pass a lot of restaurants along the way. I have tried a few dishes that have been really good, but I think I have a favorite- the pork marinated in Coca-Cola. The pork is tender (not fatty), and is covered in a sauce that will make you slap your momma. Oh, did I mention there is a lady in the back making homemade tortillas? Please remember to tip this nice lady -- she is working hard back there. The staff is friendly and attentive , and there is a good chance you will catch live music while enjoying the best Mexican food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It's okay here.   The waitstaff was great, the menu is really big... but I'm on a quest for Texmex and yet again, haven't found it.  If you need some mexican food near the base, here's your place. I wouldn't make a trip from anywhere in the valley to come here though."}
{"text":"I could sit and eat the bean dip and table side guac all day. It's excellent. You could do it too, because the service is OUTSTANDING!   But we can't all survive on chips, so I order more food to satisfy my inner fat-kid. I haven't had anything that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed, but I am a huge fan of the fajitas...and those oh-so-good fresh tortillas.   Bring a wheel barrow. They may just roll you out for free."}
{"text":"The hubs and I were there for dinner last night and it was amazing! The service was impeccable, the were very attentive to us, even thought there were some large parties seated near us. The servers were not wandering aimlessly throughout the restaurant, they were on a mission to please the customers and make sure that they felt as though they were the only guest in the house! Jose, our waiter was excellent, his other server-bus was literally running throughout the tables cleaning up, serving chips, and checking on tables...Our food came out in a timely manner and was excellent! The homemade flour tortillas are outstanding and the manager inquired as to how our meal was @the end of dinner and was genuine about it! It is close to nellis afb which was perfect! We may have to go back for cinco de mayo!"}
{"text":"The carne asada dish. OMG!  We showed up at 4pm and lunch menu was still in effect and so was happy hour (2 x 1 margaritas).  They bring out salsa and refried beans with chips, which is a nice change.  Like I mentioned before, I ordered the carne asada plate off of the lunch menu and the steak was a slice of New York steak.  I ordered it medium and it was so tender, juicy and flavorful.  And with freshly made tortillas.  The margaritas were ok, nothing out of the ordinary but the steak is what made this place so memorable."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here, especially because they have guac!!! I've heard many positive things about the restaurant so I decided to give it a try. We were greeted by a friendly host and sat in a booth as requested. It wasn't too busy so I expected things to go smoothly, but I was wrong. Server came to get our drink order and they came fast but from there on everything went down hill. We ordered guacamole and it took about 15 mins before the server came and made it table side. After that we put in our entree order and that took about 40 minutes. By the time our food came we were full from the chips, guac, salsa, and beans but we still managed to share my chicken sopitos (they were soooooo good). Unfortunately because the food took so long we weren't able to eat our torta. I asked for the manager because we were unhappy with how our experience had gone so far. He apologized but it didn't seem sincere, he was actually making excuses of why it took so long(a torta does NOT take 40 minutes to make). I mean, I've worked in the restaurant industry and if someone's food ever took long I would apologize and find a way to make it better(no we weren't fishing for free food, we paid for what we consumed). All in all the food was good but it took way too long, not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love the food, the quality and the experience, not to mention the staff are so attentive!"}
{"text":"The good thing? The food is delicious. The bad thing? Waiter doesn't speak nor understand English very much! It was easier to point out what I wanted then speak to him. Ummm, this is America, people, learn the language! Great atmosphere with someone singing and playing the keyboard. The servers were attentive to our needs but it felt like overkill being watched as I ate. As soon as I put down my bowl, someone was ready to take it away. The tables are a bit small to place all our food and drinks on and it took forever to get our bill. I don't know if we will be back."}
{"text":"Authentic flavor, great customer service, quick to bring out your food, friendly, attentive and always make Birthday surprises fun. Favorite Mexican restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"Zapatas a local favorite of many but didn't quite live up to my expectations. For what it was supposed to be or at least what I was assured it was from the masses, Very good authentic mexican food. I came with a party of three including I for a brunch breakfast meal, our server was a little tone deaf or hard at hearing maybe a combination of the two. When our orders were brought to the table we had items missing some that were requested and some that were supposed to be included with the meal or so the menu says but after my argument with my server he assured me I was wrong. The food itself was ok I did like it but my rice tasted a little dry how can something be wet and have a dry taste to it was it microwaved?"}
{"text":"What I liked: The food. The tortilla chips were amazing, bean dip rocked (I inhaled it), shrimp ceviche (although since the shrimp was cooked, it's not ceviche) and the tamales. The service was very attentive, especially to make sure my iced tea was filled. Food came out rather quick, too, which was nice.  What I didn't like: Not having a tamale specific option. I had to order them a la carte or with an option I didn't want. I also didn't like the condition of the menus. When a restaurant's (large) pages stick together, I want hand sanitizer provided. There's no reason for them to stick together if you would wipe them down daily.  The food was just too good so it gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in all of Vegas. The food is all made from scratch and the service is always great. Great Caritas and the rid eye is awesome."}
{"text":"Typically, WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS, STAYS IN VEGAS, right???  But I need to tell EVERYONE that WHENEVER IN VEGAS, you gotta make the drive out to visit Viva Zapatas!!!  THIS PLACE IS WONDERFUL!!  From the decor, to the food, to the music, its all amazing!!!  The owner greets you personally and can I just say that he is great!  Thanks for tequila shot on my bday!!!  woot woot!!  VIVA VIVA ZAPATAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Mexican restaurant in North Las Vegas! On the weekends, you will find a live mariachi band performing around the dining room. Stop in on your birthday for a fun mariachi style tequila shot.  The food is typical Mexican offerings and even offers tongue tacos.   The service sometimes can be a little slow, but usually the wait staff is on top of it.   Parking is always a problem when they are busy. So you might be stuck parking down the street or waiting for a car to pull out."}
{"text":"The food here was incredible! The portions were very filling and most everyone takes home leftovers. The flour tortillas are homemade and delicious! This was the best Mexican I've eaten and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Good food, a bit of a wait but was satisfied with the food and staff ,will recommend to anyone that asks \"where should I go eat today\""}
{"text":"If you can't find a spot to park, then there is a good chance you are about to eat a good meal! Cute quaint little restaurant. Outstanding made to order table side, guacamole dip! Generous portions, and super speedy service. There's nothing I hate more than to wait around for a long time for food with two small kids. Courteous staff too! This is only my second time eating there, I am certain to go back. And to save money, I will make sure to go at lunch time. The lunch menu will save you a few bucks, and you get the same great food!"}
{"text":"Right off the Craig Rd. exit on the 15 North is a great little Mexican restaurant called Viva Zapatas. It's a relatively small spot that you would probably miss if you weren't looking for it. The food is excellent, but the parking is tight. Zapatas makes for a great lunch spot or a great dinner place to wow your out of town guests. The restaurant has a cozy atmosphere and features a cool bar in the center of the restaurant with a couple of over head tv screens so you won't miss the big game. You can find a picture or two of Emilliano Zapata hanging on the walls along with a few other eclectic Mexican artifacts. The food is excellent! They start you off with chips, salsa, and beans. This place reminds me of a great Mexican restaurant that is no more called Sal's Mexican Inn in Oxnard,Ca. Go with a combination plate, no need for an appetizer because the portions are good. I like the #4 combo which is a pork burrito, chicken enchilada, chicken taco, and rice and beans. I like to substitute the chicken taco for a chorizo taco. I'm not sure if the chorizo taco is even on the menu, but don't leave without one. They are excellent. The pork burrito is so tasty and the chicken enchilada pops off your plate and into your mouth. The enchilada is smothered in cheese just how I like it. Be sure to order the guacamole and watch them come over to your table and make it fresh in front of your eyes. The guacamole is first class. Zapatas also has a killer chile relleno. On the way out don't leave without what I call the best after dinner mints in town-undisputed. These little green babies aren't so minty, but more lemon limey. They will leave a refreshing taste in your mouth for the ride home. The bottom line is no matter what you order at Viva Zapatas you won't be disappointed, so if you're in Northtown you have to drop by."}
{"text":"The food was just ok but I'm originally from Southern California so I'm used to really good Mexican food. However, the mango margaritas were amazing. I would go back many times for margaritas and the sopapillas (dessert)."}
{"text":"Everytime we go to Viva, food has been excellent. But the wait staff and the manager really make it a great dining experience.  They are really on the ball. The live music is a plus. Tortillas are handmade and the guacamole is made at your table to your tastes. Soup is great and the salsa and bean dip are sssooo good. Everything we have ordered have been great. From the tacos, steaks, and fried fish. Parking is limited so go early."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. This place has the best wait staff and the food is awesome. Having moved from Texas we were looking for some authentic Mexican food, and we definitely found it here. The atmosphere is nice as well; it's very laid back plus they have a live singer. What more could you ask for? All around it was an great experience that I will be doing again and again. This place made me miss home."}
{"text":"Perfect hidden gem! We grabbed the Botana Papa Pepe and Taquitos Dorados as takeout for the road. The service was very friendly and even on a packed night, they made my order before the time promised and even called me when it was ready as I gassed up the car. 3 appetizer orders total was perfect for our car of hungry travelers and my daughter now magically loves guacamole. Gracias and we'll be back.  PS- Jalapeños were YUM!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Despite it being packed, the service was prompt and the dining room was very clean. Everyone in my party loved what they got including myself. The two quesadillas I got had just the right amount of ingredients and two of the people I was there with raved about the chicken. The bathrooms were also very clean and the sinks were these cool copper basins. To top it off, the place was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews in Yelp and a co-worker telling me about this place I have to say it was well worth the busy! The food was so good!!! This is the best Mexican food I've had in a long time! I had carne Asada enchiladas and my friend had the nachos along with Cadillac margaritas! I can't wait to come back and try some other entrees!!! Oh and customer service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in Vegas! And the horchata is delicious! I have been to a lot of Mexican places that don't even compare. You have to try it to believe it!"}
{"text":"Husband and I came in on a Wednesday at 8 to place a to-go order. We had quite a bit of sticker shock with the prices. Most plates ranged from $17-21. We went ahead and ordered two a la carte burritos hoping it would be worth it/generously portioned/something to justify the prices. Hostess was friendly and the food came out not particularly speedy but not slow enough to complain, and they did get our order correct (no easy feat, I am a picky eater.) The food itself however was average at best. The chile colorado was a little bland and tough, and was the ONLY thing in the burrito. Definitely would not have been worth paying full-plate prices. In fact I think I've had better tasting burritos for much less elsewhere. Overall the place is OK, but we are going to keep looking for our Mexican \"spot.:"}
{"text":"I don't really like Mexican food, but if that is what the day's food choice is, I'd pick Zapata's over any other Mexican restaurant in town!  The service here is always top notch, and since I work close by and have been here more times than I can count, it is a lot to say that the service has never let us down.  The food is top quality for Mexican food, from the shredded beef tacos to the enchiladas.  Nothing is ever served too salty or greasy, just perfect.  The lunch dishes come with a free drink, which is a great deal too!    My favorite dish has to be 16 on the lunch menu.  I can't remember the name, but it is basically a couple of slices of juicy chicken breasts topped with a creamy sauce, with beans and rice on the side.  with this special, you get your choice of homemade corn or flour tortillas (I prefer the flour, but they are both good).  And if you look at the southwest corner of the restaurant, you can see your fresh tortillas being prepared right on the spot!    Zapatas is a favorite in our community, and in Las Vegas in general.  I know people that come from across town to eat here.  It really is a top notch, affordable restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Use to live down the street now moved to the other side of Vegas and I still drive all the way up there. The food and SERVICE is excellent. You will never have to worry about being ignored, their customer service is what sticks out to me the most and the food is a + . Love their avocado tacos!"}
{"text":"Best spot I've been too that has authentic Mexican food to their chips and salsa and a side of refried beans.. to their fideo soup to start before u get your meal.. I had the green chilaquiles with carne asada which was a fulfilling meal and great flavor. As for my boyfriend had the tostadas of ceviche and that was a hit too.. I truly recommend this spot.. we look forward to coming to this spot again..thank you for the great service.."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever, use to be real good but over the yrs it went down hill!  Guess their more into the money than the food ...  So where to begin ...  If u actually turn the lights up or use the light on ur phone you'll see that the place is really dirty and not clean.  My kid dropped his toy and I had to use my phone to look for it under the booth and it looks like it hasn't been swept in yrs.  The menus have old crusty food still on it and haven't been updated or replaced since the last time I was here in 2006.    Waiters are either rude or doesn't speak English, told him several times please quit grabbing stuff over my plate.  I will not be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"True to its theme, this restaurant offers great food and great service from the moment you walk in until you step out. The hostess was welcoming and prompt to seat us. Our server was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"My family and I used to frequently visit this place a couple years back. We loved the authentic Mexican food and the nice service. But in the past year, this place has really gone downhill. Everytime we go it takes at least an hour for them to serve us and the food and salsa progressively get more salty and less flavorful. It's such a shame this place keeps getting worse."}
{"text":"Lucky for me the two women that I had a meeting with on the north side of town have eaten here..On the industrial side of Craig & I-15, chances of finding this on my own are slim.  I'm also very picky when it comes to Mexican food, not disappointed, this was a great find.   Then again, that was obvious when we had to wait a few minutes for a table. The place was packed and the aroma filling the air was mouth watering.   After being seated we were served chips with a bowl of salsa and a bowl of beans.  The salsa was very flavorful and this is the first time I have ever had bean dip that was seasoned (very tasty)   For lunch my client and I both ordered the Ensalad Marinara - large salad for less than $10, a great price for shrimp, avocado and pico de gallo. My business partner ordered the ceviche which she also said was very flavorful.   Food was good, service was great and everyone was very friendly.  Will definitely be back when on the north side of town!"}
{"text":"First of all, it's in a horrible location unless you work out that way or drive a truck.  It's very dark inside with traditional decor.  Thbe menu is pretty extensive.  I ordered the chile colorado.  The gave free chips with warm refried beans and salsa.  The chips tasted slightly burnt and te salsa was kinda bland.  The colorado was a litte tangy and lacked the depth of chile flavor.  The service was good.  Not worth the trip out thee but decent if you are nearby."}
{"text":"The salsa is my fav! Everything in this restaurant is handmade from scratch nothing canned! I asked!!!! I haven't had one thing on the menu I haven't loved.  Its a  must for authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican food restaurant in Vegas to me. Every time I come here the food is amazing, and all the employees are super nice. The food is at a pretty moderate rate, but the food comes in great quantity is and delicious so it's well worth it. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a good restaurant!"}
{"text":"I am gonna be as honest as i can reviewing this restaurant. It appears that I am the only one in the party of 15 we had that didn't really like this place. We came here on the recommendation of my father in law, who figured we'd all need menudo to cure our hangovers this past Saturday morning. Maybe it was because I wanted a good ol' fashioned American breakfast or maybe because I have certain restaurants back home, but this place just didn't do it for me. With that being said, this is what I found:  LOCATION & DECOR  It was beautiful both inside and out. Bar area took up most of the restaurant. Major selection of tequilas. Seating for big parties wasn't the best and we must have taken up about 1/4 of the restaurant. Location is good for those visiting or stationed at Nellis Air Force Base, but bad for people staying on or near the strip, as it is a good 15 minutes from the Dowtown Las Vegas, 20 from the strip.  SERVICE:  Seating- We were seated right away, rare for such a big party, but we were there around breakfast time, so beat the rush.  Wating- Our server took the drink order right away, brought them out right away and the beers were ice cold, as well as the mugs we asked for, and the margarita drinkers in the party said that they were poured generously. This is where my low stars come into play. IT TOOK TWO HOURS FROM ARRIVAL TO DEPARTURE! We must have waited a good 45 minutes before all the dishes began to come out. We were brought out salsa, which was OUTSTANDING, refried beans w/ cheese, also pretty good exept for the big glop of cheese in the middle, and those kept coming out, but by the time the food had arrived, I was full!  FOOD:  I didn't like my machaca. I had the pork after being given the option of pork or beef. I should have went with my gut and gotten the beef. It was okay, but not a dish that said, \"WOW\". Although, I have to give credit to the waiter because when I asked him what was better between the machaca and the chilaquiles, he said go with the machaca, and even though it didn't wow me, he was able to recommend something to me, which alot of waiters can't or won't do. Now If I would have only asked him if the pork or beef were better, I might have enjoyed my meal more.  Some in my party ordered campechanas (seafood cocktails) and they were pretty much licking the sides afterwards, so they all seemed to enjoy it. My wife had a grilled chicken breast in a garlic sauce, and it was pretty tasty. A good friend ordered the Pipian, and she said it was some of the best she's ever tasted that isn't her mama's.  Overall, I think this place would be good for drinks and watching a game, as they had the Charger game on that day. It might even be good for a smaller group then ours, say 2-4 people, maybe no more than 6. Two hours is a long time to be in a restaurant, especially when most of that time is spent waiting on food to come out, and maybe it could have been because our group is so large, but I've had faster service in other restaurants with a group just as big. I might give it another shot one day, but not anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food but the front staff (specifically the lady with short hair and glasses) Elizabeth I believe her name was, spoke Spanish to our waiter the entire time we were checking out. She did that on purpose so we wouldn't know what she was saying, joke is on her, we are Filipino and understood everything. It's really rude to speak another language to your coworkers  in front of your customers. Unprofessional and such a shame because the food is awesome.   *went back a second time to see if anything has changed, and literally the entire staff spoke Spanish to us. Geeze. I guess it's a must to learn how to speak Spanish if you want to dine here."}
{"text":"This place is great. Have been there quite a few times and it is one of my favorites. The fideo soup that is given with every meal is great and I have even ordered a large bowl of it once.  The shrimp stuffed avocados, queso fundido, shrimp cocktails are awesome.  The service in the restaurant is pretty good but the bar is a little off. Every time I go they mess up the drink, never bring it, or bring the check when you ask. It isn't one bartender either, it has been a few different ones. Just order the drinks at the table and you will like it."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food hands down!!!! I have been searching for an authentic Mexican restaurant and I believe I've found it. We came for lunch & the food was awesome. They offer over 22 lunch specials that all come with rice, beans & tortillas. Let's not forget the complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip. The salsa was LEGIT lol none of that generic watery salsa from a container. It was roasted from chilies and perfection to my mouth. Lol overall it's an awesome place with great food & service! Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Ate at the bar for dinner. Gracie made me an awesome skinny margarita and hubby had a yummy house margarita. Totally agree with other reviewers. Salsa and beans with chips were yum! The soup they give us good too.   I had the #1 combo with a chile relleno, beef taco and chicken enchilada. Hubby had shrimp fajitas. Fajitas were good -normal fajitas. Coming from So Cal, I know good Mexican food. My dinner was one of the best I have had!   They also had a great guitar player which made for a really cool atmosphere. Will definitely come here next time through Vegas!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best service I have ever gotten! Wow, very attentive and great food. Love the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I ended up in this place after a 6 hour flight between Ford Airport in Michigan and Chicago's O'Hare. By the time I got to Vegas I was tired, hungry and in need of a drink. I ended up walking into this place during Happy hour. Within minutes there were two huge margaritas on the rocks with extra salt in front of me and an encyclopedic menu of house specialties in my hands! So far so good!   The guacamole, house salsa and chips were great. The all inclusive sampler appetizer was more then three people could go through and the portion sizes were borderline gluttonous...everything was perfect. I had the Pollo Sarandeado Estilo \"Rebelion\". It was spicy enough to order another margarita but flavorful and not over the top with heat.   The service and ambiance was wonderful. The waitstaff was prompt and on their best game and the drinks and food kept coming throughout the night. There were also decommissioned rifles and other weapons all over the walls and seeing how I was there to attend a military course, I felt right at home. I'll definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were looking for a fiesta of flavors- this place was decent, however for the price it was a bit of a let down. The opening snacks of chips and salsa and refried beans were amazing and very addictive. Salsa had good flavor and spice. Then came the complimentary soup that comes with every entrée. This was pretty good as well- at most places it has an overly tomato taste, but it was more subdued here which I like. But nothing to run home and rave about- at the end of the day it's just a little broth with some noodles. Now to the main course: Tacos de pescado- The fish was breaded and fried served in a flour tortilla. Just because something is fried doesn't mean it has to completely lack flavor. There was absolutely zero seasoning. I had to drench the tacos in the sauce that came on the side in order to get any flavor, and then all I ended up tasting in the end was the sauce. Beef Fajitas- again the meat completely lacked flavor. We were looking for spice or something and just got overdone chewy pieces of steak. For a $17 entrée we were very disappointed. And the meat to pepper ratio was horrible. There was barely enough meat to make two tacos and the plate was piled high with so much filler- onions and bell peppers.  Overall- these two dishes weren't home runs, but I can see that this place has the potential to produce delicious dishes however I probably will not be returning to find out."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Found this place through yelp! Service was great, super clean and friendly. Not to mention, their food was Delicious! We ordered the steak cilantro, chile verde quesadilla and chicken burrito (enchilada style). Portion sizes are huge so try not to get full on the chips salsa and beans. :)"}
{"text":"The Best Mexican Restaurant in Vegas. I am visiting North Las Vegas which is bit of a dump and has no good restaurants, then, I found VZ's a Gem of a place tonight. Great food, excellent service and some live but soft music. Couldn't believe the portions you get and the attention from the Waiters. Full meal at under $20.00.  I don't expect to be around this area much but I would go out my way to come here from downtown when I am. Hard to find due to construction: across from Jack in the Box and next to Pilot. 10/10 for me"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Great atmosphere and good music. Our service was a little slow (reason for the 4 star) but we weren't in a rush."}
{"text":"We usually always end up at Lindo Michoacán by Las Lomas in Henderson but we wanted to try somewhere else. I've always passed by Viva Zapatas and I told my husband we should try it out. Well...here it goes.  There was a 15-20 minute wait (which I don't mind because it was a Mother's day Weekend). I pictured the restaurant waaaay bigger but I was wrong. The entrance is so small that if you do have to wait just know that you're gonna be waiting outside in the heat.   The table that they gave us was near the entrance. I wanted to switch tables BUT I knew that was gonna be another 20 minute wait and we were already starving. Anyways, it was pretty dark inside. Felt like we were some dam vampires.  Now to the food....so....if I would of known that they pretty much did the exactly same thing as Lindo Michoacán, I would of just gone to Lindo Michoacán. The chips and dips are pretty much the same. Oh and let's not forget the fideo. Which by the way had no taste at all AND pretty much there was no fideos in my dam soup! Huh!? Felt like I was drinking colored water. But I will give them this...I ordered a combo of chile rellenos without the sauce. That was some good ass Chile rellenos. The beans were pretty good and the rice was ehh...but I wasn't super impressed.   The service was okay....  I wouldn't come back.  P.S. I was gonna give them two stars BUT the chile rellenos saved them."}
{"text":"How lucky am I? After returning to Las Vegas from golfing at Wolf Creek I happened to stop for gas at a seven eleven and asked the lady behind the counter if she could recommend a good Mexican restaurant. Of course she directed me a mile up the road to Zapatas. There were no large tables available so they sat me across from the bar at a little two seater table. The chips salsa and beans practically followed me to the table....amazingly quick service. The wait staff offered service with a smile and the food was delectable! The offerings are so vast I had trouble deciding between a burrito or the pollo a cognac. The waiter steered me towards the chicken dish and I wasn't disappointed. The creamy sauce was out of this world and the chicken was tender and sauteed with onions and mushrooms. I was pleased to stumble upon this local gem and you better believe I will go out of my way to return on my next trip to sin city!"}
{"text":"Personally this is one the best places to have great Mexican food, next to Las Islitas off Las Vegas blvd and Carey. Chips and salsa are great, and the food is always good!!! Only problem I have with this place is how small it is. Try coming here for a date night on a Saturday evening....you'll be waiting for a good while sometimes depending on how busy it is. If you've ever had Lindo michoacan then expect the same kind of taste in food...because both business are family related."}
{"text":"I loved this place. My spouse and I ate here tonight and the sopitas we're wonderful, the flautas we're crispy and fresh, and the enchiladas hit the spot. Chips, salsa, and beans without a word to start. Excellent margarita, so my better half attests. The service was impecable (we are both former servers). Laid back, low key, just right. We will be back."}
{"text":"The food was so bland and we were very disappointed in our food. We ordered the sandwich and it had barely any meet on it and no spice or flavor at all! This is a awful choice if you are vegetarian there are no options, I ordered vegetarian burrito and it was a flour tortilla with bland veggies and that's it! I was so bummed I had to spend my money! Oh! And the prices!!!! $12 for my veggie burrito! Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"Great food! Chips were good but slightly greasy. Bean dip amazing!! My husband practically ate the whole thing!! Very generous serving. I ordered the Zapata Burrito and it was ginormous!! Honestly you could share it with another person or two. I only ate a quarter of it and was stuffed. Definitely would go back if I was in the area!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! LOVE the grilled fish tacos & margaritas!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! And oh the bean dip and guacamole are heaven :) I get the steak salad - yummy! The shrimp in some sort of lemon garlic stuff is really good too! Only downfall is price, I always come out spending Wayyy more than intended (thus the reason for 4 stars wish I could do like 4 1/2)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! I was absolutely blown away by their service. From the outside, it just looks like a plain Mexican food joint next to a truck stop. Then inside decorations,music, and lighting transport you to festive Mexico.   The table side prepared guac was amazing. The staff are quick and friendly. Chips, drinks, sauces were refilled without havering to flag anyone down. Host was knowledgeable about the menu since there was a large selection of authentic food.   I've literally passed by this place hundreds of times on Craig. And now I think I've found my new local spot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Above and beyond GREAT service, incredible food, and a huge selection of beers and Tequila. There were 3 of us. .we tried the Tilapia (whole) slightly dry but VERY tasty, Carne Asada - OMG good, and the cheese enchiladas exactly what you expect.  We also had the guacamole made table side. ..the waiter was extremely entertaining and full of joy!  Best service we have had at any restaurant in months!  You won't be disappointed! !!!!!"}
{"text":"Were do i start? I have been coming here since i have lived in Las Vegas. That will be about 14 years. It has the best carne asada and chips and salsa. Gosh they load u up on the chips salsa and bean dip. My favorite thing to eat here is there shreeded beef crunchy tacos. The fideo soup reminds me of when I was a kid. If you want the best meal on this side of town. This is the place. American or mexican this is the best resteraunt in the North!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick dinner near Nellis, so we took the family to Zapatas.  How amazing!  I've lived and traveled throughout the southwest, and this was fantastic Mexican cuisine.  I had the Carne asada plate at the waiter's recommendation.   It was perfect.  The Pico and guacamole served with it were also spot on.  If only I could have finished it after the fresh chips, salsa, and  bean dip which was served complimentary.    The kids meals were also great and the adults enjoyed yummy frozen margaritas.  We will definitely be returning often.  While totally worth the wait, make sure you allow plenty of time at dinner as it took awhile for all our fresh food to be prepared. Service was excellent and very attentive."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for the week for my daughter's wedding and wanted to try someplace different...not a chain, not on the strip, but great none the less....we found it in Viva Zapatas!  We went on a Monday night, and made reservations since there were going to be about 10 of us. We only had to wait about 10 min. after we got there, no problems at all. It isn't very big, but it's decorated wonderfully and it doesn't feel crowded at all, just right. One thing I loved is that the entire time we were there there was a 1 man mariachi playing a guitar and singing live. I don't know if he is there all the time or not, but I loved it...just added to the ambiance.  We ordered an appetizer of Queso Fundido con Chorizo in addition to the complimentary chips, salsa, and frijoles. Oh my goodness! It was the best, cheesiest, sausage-y goodness ever!  Our table also ordered a pitcher of Cadillac Margs...the \"pitcher\" was more of a carafe, but the margs were delish!  With 10 of us there were a variety of entrees ordered and everyone loved theirs. Mine was a cheese enchilada and chili relleno, both were delicious.  Flan for dessert topped off the evening perfectly.   When I'm in Vegas again I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The best ribeye in Las Vegas and they have the best tableside guacamole and Sylvia our server was the best. Everything perfect!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just started using Yelp and this place is excellent. I originally thought the reviews might be over-exaggerated but the food is very authentic and the service is great. The drinks are good too. We enjoyed the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times. It's proximity to home and work made it my go-to Mexican spot most of the time, but it's not my favorite spot, or favorite Mexican in Vegas. It's pretty good, a must try.  I'm not their biggest salsa fan, but it's spicy so I enjoy that. The table side guacamole is very good. The menu is large, items are  priced a bit higher than I prefer, but the portions are huge. I've enjoyed their quesadillas with shrimp, avocado shells stuffed with shrimp and pico, and most of all the fideo. Honestly, I always came for beer and fideo. I felt the fish and shrimp tacos were quite bland, and the burritos are packed with way too much meat and nothing else.  The service is always friendly. It gets very busy here, so beware of that. I have waited longer than I'd like to admit for food here. A decent spot, but not the best."}
{"text":"Best Mexican sit down restaurant we have found in Vegas. It's a hidden gem in an industrial area of town, but it never disappoints. The waiters are always very friendly and remember us when we come in. Their portions are large enough you could share. Their drinks are delicious, but their homemade tortillas are why we frequent this restaurant so often!"}
{"text":"It was pouring when we came here, but yet it was super busy. My two friends and I came on a Sunday night, around 6:30 or so and someone held the door for us and welcomed us in. It was really dark inside, which made it kind of difficult to read the menu (the words were small too) but the booths were comfy, it was warm and the music was good. We were given chips, salsa and beans while we waited for our server.   My friends ordered a large margarita which was surprisingly good and very strong. After our server took our drink orders and dropped off our waters, he disappeared for 10 minutes. I am not exaggerating, waiting 10 minutes to order is not acceptable. My friends were sure he forgot about us.   Finally, we were able to order our food but by then we had already filled up on chips and salsa (the busboy refilled it for us twice already). Instead of ordering the chicken enchilada, chicken taco and tamale combo I got the beef enchilada and tamale combo instead. My friends stuck with their steaks, one ordered the Cola steak and not sure what my other friend ordered.   We were all given a tomato based soup to start off with. My friend said that it usually tasted better, and was kind of bland today. I tried it, and it did taste a bit watered down, I added some salt and pepper to it but didn't care for it much.   My friends ordered guacamole, which was made table side. One guacamole was used along with probably half of a tomato... was it worth the $8? Not so sure, but it WAS good.  The steaks and my combo came with rice and beans, my friends' steaks were supposed to come with tortillas but they didn't and by the time the server checked up on us, they didn't want them anymore. The beef enchilada was filling, lots of shredded beef and it wasn't too salty! I was too full to try my tamale but did get a bite of my friends' steaks. Both were very soft, and well seasoned. I didn't like the cola steak because it reminded me of a cola flavored bbq sauce that was overly sweet.   Unfortunately since we filled up on chips, we only had a couple bites of our food and asked for the rest to be boxed up. Our server wasn't around much, but the busboy was amazing and very attentive. He boxed up our food, tableside and was the person refilling our chips and waters.   Our server came by, asked us if we wanted dessert and we said no, just the check. Then, he left somewhere, and a few minutes later came back to ask us if we wanted dessert again.   It was a 25 minute drive from my place, but I wanted to come here because my friends raved about it. After my initial experience, I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon and will just stick to someplace closer to me."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I didn't even get to eat the food because I was waiting so long. They guaranteed that if we sat at the bar we would get a table within 10 - 15mins. That didn't happen in fact it looked like they forgot about us. I even inquired about our placement and they ensured they didn't forget. Plus they said oh we will get you guys menus and they never did. of course I attempted to ask but couldn't get anyone's attention so we left. Do yourself a favor and go to some other Mexican restaurant if you want to eat and be served properly."}
{"text":"Once again, Viva Zap's delivers! Love the Grandma Mag's chicken!  Serrandiado sauce is positively incredible."}
{"text":"I just love this place! The beans are to die for & the flavors NEVER disappoint me. no one is ever unpolite! Just freaking love it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, the service is always on point, the food here is always fantastic and the ambience is great with a live guitar player in the evening, their fresh baked flour tortillas remind me of my grandmas hot buttery delicious home made tortillas.., like I said, I've been coming here for many years, we love it!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in town. The margarites are off the hook. They have a friendly staff who makes great recommendations."}
{"text":"I've visited this place 3 times in the past year.  I'm from California...but whenever I'm in town i make a point to come here. It sometimes has a wait but that's because the corn tortillas are made fresh on site and the micheladas are outstanding! I've brought my toddlers here and they love the chips which are served with a bowl of warm refried beans along with salsa. They have a great kids coloring menu with several choices.  They also have a small bar,  if you're not dining with kids. This visit, the service was less than great and the hostess was pretty inept but in the past the service was wonderful. I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here many times when they have their lunch specials. The prices are very decent, especially for the amount of food they give. The carne asada (#30) is soooo good. The servers are very friendly, too. Outside of the lunch specials, they offer military discount which is another plus! The only thing I don't like about it is they will only discount the food the military member gets even if that person is paying for the entire party's bill."}
{"text":"Real good authentic Mexican food is not limited to tacos. There is such a wide variety, and it differs from east to west and north to south! Viva Zapatas has definitely hit that note straight on! The food is based off of traditional cuisine from the state of Morelos in Mexico. So it does tend to be heartier, earthier foods since Morelos is landlocked, and not as much of the seafood stuff. But they do offer a variety of shrimp dishes, and a couple of fish ones.  The ambiance is very unique. Tons of old \"ranchero\" artifacts adorn the wall. Colorful picados hang in the halls. And of course lets not forget the man himself Emiliano Zapata (for whom the restaurant is named) in a vintage frame!  Now - to the food. Before you plan your visit for dinner - starve yourself for most of the day! (or be prepared for lots of leftovers)!! :D Haven't been there for lunch service but just might have to one of these days.  Once you are seated, you immediately are brought tortilla chips, refried beans, and salsa (red). Now, I will warn you - don't finish the tortillas off! (they bring you more, it's the neverending pit of chips!) So unless you want to fill up on chips and dip, back off them! (I prefer to add a splash of lime to mine, so they definitely accommodate). You are also brought an appetizer soup - I don't know what it is. But the best way I can think of it - chicken noodle meets tortilla soup!  Last time I had eaten here, I had the mole served up with beans and rice - and it was superb! Portion was HUGE so everyone in the group had doggie bags heading home.  This time round I wanted to do something a little different - so I went for the 'Pollo con napoles\" (Chicken with Prickly Pear Cactus). VERY deeeeeelicious! Had just the right touch of heat, and seasoned beautifully with the cilantro and other veggies. ($14 entree) Now here is the part that had me craving the \"tortillarias\" that I used to see on the streets of mexico - fresh, homemade, tortillas! And when I say fresh - I mean they have a gal working her tail end off mixing the dough up portioning it out, and cooking it all up on a traditional griddle. So if you have a small enough party and want to entertain your little one, ask for the table close to the tortilla zone so the little one can watch the tortilla making process! And yes they offer you the choice, corn or flour for your tortilla.  I can't remember what the other members had in our party, one had the combo 2, another had the fajitas i think. But all I can remember is hearing everyone going - \"wow, this is REALLY good food!\" And yes we brought home all the leftovers! Had them for our lunch today, and both hubby and I still have more leftovers for lunch tomorrow! So yeah $14 entree spllt into 3 meals! :)   I know this is a longwinded review - but have to just really lay it all out on the line for you! Almost done - just got the service to go over, and you'll be done.  Service: impeccable! Everyone from the entrance to the bus boys are extremely professional and EXTREMELY polite! They do everything they can to ensure you are satisfied with your meal, and are very quick to refill your glass (or ask about it) if they it is going on empty.  Still want more?   Well, stop reading and go drive there and discover this place! :)"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices!  Very similar to Lindo Michoacan.  Enjoyed the ambiance and the service was great."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for many years the food is the best and i have always been overly satisfied when i eat here."}
{"text":"The after dinner mint on the front counter caught my attention more than the food we paid for. Bland, overpriced, tasteless are just a few of the adjectives I'd use to describe  'Viva's' food. I'm sorry, but refried beans and pre-cooked rice are not authentic Mexican. Unless you consider Del Taco authentic. If you do, I feel sorry for you.  They were busy, and we waited for half an hour. That is not a complaint. Just a fact.  Once seated the waiter appeared quickly to take our drink order. (Margaritas) Those were fine. Chips and salsa soon followed. Salsa was as bland as the refried beans that came at the same time.  The menu is extensive, but I'd venture a guess not much different than what we ordered. Bland.  I had a combo with beef, ( had a huge blob of fat in the middle) pork in a salsa verde (green salsa) and a very greasy chicken taco. With of course, red rice and beans.  My fiancé had chicken enchiladas in a flavorless green sauce. To be fair, she enjoyed the rice.   Save some money, go to the Del Taco."}
{"text":"Well overdue update ...my third party experience did this place no justice! AT ALL!! I recently have been ordering shrimp dishes off their lunch special menu and let me tell you they are all awesome! You receive a fideo soup and a drink on the side! Most dishes come with rice and beans, and I always ask for habanero salsa! The wait times are lengthy, but the food is always fresh and the customer service is great every time!   My only suggestion is order your food, wait 10 mins,   then leave home. That way you don't blow your gas in the parking lot or waste precious time cramped in the small waiting area!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Extremely family friendly, and most of the time, there's a live musician setting an authentic mood. I come here often with my daughter (16 mos), because they take very good care of you. They bring out a small plate of rice, veggies and meat for the little one(s) very early, sometimes before I've made up my mind about what I want to eat.  The tortillas are made fresh, you can watch the lady make them, and so is the guacamole, which they'll put together right in front of you. Oh, and if you think decorations stop at the bathroom door, think twice. These bathrooms are NICE! I know that's an odd thing to notice, but it did make an impression on me. :) They're also honest about their mistakes. My friend and I wanted to try a new dessert they were offering. We had already paid for it, when the manager found out they didn't have anymore, so he gave us TWO desserts of our choice, even though we had only paid for one."}
{"text":"Another surprise Yelp find for me! I had never heard of this place or even see it, even though I've driven by a billion times. It's kinda small but they seem to move pretty quickly so if you do wait, it shouldn't be long.  The food here is excellent! If you're a fan of guacamole, make sure you try the fresh guac here. A waiter will come out with fresh avocados, all the fixings and make it exactly how you want...so good! Their chips are homemade and they also have a really good fideo soup. I ordered shrimp ceviche for my dinner which was alright but definitely not the best I've had. My wife had chicken fajitas which was great and I would definitely recommend it.   Aside from the food, this restaurant has some of the best service I've ever gotten. The staff is friendly and ridiculously fast at getting what you need. My drink never came close to being empty. Their menu is also pretty big so there's something for everyone here. I'd come back, even if just for the great service and killer fresh guacamole!"}
{"text":"The service is always great not to mention the quality of food never changes ... Totally worth every penny"}
{"text":"Wonderful Mexican restaurant. Full-bar with nightly music. Terrific full-service staff, where guacamole is prepared table-side. We wanted for nothing, including the house merlot, which was more than adequate for our meals.  I enjoyed the chili verde, which is my standard dish for a new Mexican restaurant. Save room for desserts.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Called in to go order of 4 quesadillas it took 45 minutes from time of order to walking out of the Resturant... Good food but their take out process needs some work."}
{"text":"Excellent service & food! Went in on a Sunday around 1pm & we had a great experience. The atmosphere is warm & the waiters are dressed like mariachi men, our waiter was Jesus and he was amazing!! Some of the best service I have had in a while! The food was delicious real Mexican food! I would definitely return!!   We had the cilantro steak & shrimp ceviche that came with fresh homemade tostadas, delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Excellent service, delicious food with generous portions. Table side prepared guacamole is worth it. There was even live music when we were there."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Hard to find a decent restaurant in North las Vegas. This is my go to spot for Mexican food up here. Prices are fair and definitely cheaper than the chain restaurants. They have an assortment of combo meals if you have a hard time deciding.  The guacamole is made fresh right in front of you and the salsa and beans are served with a smile."}
{"text":"The worst $19 margarita I ever had. The food isn't any better than Roberto's. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant that is ALWAYS busy but very accommodating. Truly delicious and entertaining venue.  They have an extensive menu with some authentic Latin recipes. Staff is always very friendly and extremely kind. I love that my cup is never less than half full. It's appreciated, the minor details."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere are a definite 5, but the food kinda sucked. I have to believe that we ate there on a bad night with a new cook who I hope was promptly thrown out of the building by a torch wielding mob. The salsa was spicy, but had no other flavor. The chips were standard. We wanted to have some queso dip with jalapenos, but they don't serve that, but whatever, not a big deal. We got some sort of combo dinner which started with soup. The soup tasted like a can of condensed tomato soup with some noodles thrown in. my entree was incredibly bland. I had some sort of burrito and enchilada, neither of which had any flavor at all. My boyfriend's food was bland as well. The only thing that was any good, was the refried beans... and even that wasn't all that great, because, well.. They're refried beans. :P Will not be returning unless they get a new cook. Service however, was perfect."}
{"text":"What a surprise.  On the industrial North Side of town.    Guacamole made table side to taste.  Food was great, service was dialed in.  Price was reasonable.  Beats the heck out of those strip restaurants that shine up for tourists."}
{"text":"Close to Nellis AFB, one of the closest mexican sport bar around... Overall review was awesome... Our waiter Antonio was excellent at providing excellent service by being aware of all his tables.. Making sure our chips and dips was never empty.. And his sense of humor is great.. He was always polite and always have a smile on... Their live musician has a very strong voice and very good on the guitar.. Atmosphere was dark-- setting the bar mood but really bring you into the Mexican theme..! Food was amazing-- the chips bean dip and salsa was unlimited and very delicious, I had their enchiladas de mole.. Which was rich with mole sauce but a bit too cheesy for me.. But still Sooooo Gooodddd!! You got to try this if you're ever around Nellis AFB! Or just in Vegas itself!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere inside was very nice and clean. The waiter was very attentive and pleasant but I didn't think the food was that great."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here several times and EVERY time it has been great! The food is delicious and authentic, the service is courteous and fast (a big plus when you have little ones), and the live music is nice. We love this place and always bring family that's visiting from out of town to Viva's."}
{"text":"Me Being Mexican. The Food was not great. Not 100% Authentic Flavor seems the rice and beans are can food not made from scratch.  2nd time igo give a try again. Not worth for the price. Fideo Soup was good. Finished my food and tortillas never arrived."}
{"text":"The service here was amazing. They have Mexican beers on draft that most places don't. I loved their chips and salsa, they brought a cup of fideo before my entree, which was delicious. I had the shrimp tacos which were very good. They sometimes have live music, so it's a nice atmosphere. If it wasn't on the other side of town I would definitely come here more."}
{"text":"Whao!  This is authetic mexican food. The chips were fresh, beans were delicious, the salsa was perfect. Noy to mention the guacamole, it was made to perfection. The food was beyond delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"Affordable Mexican food with an authentic Mexican taste is hard to come by. Viva Zapata's is just that. A great atmosphere and even better food, Viva Zapata's has become my go-to restaurant for Lunch and Dinner. The customer service is head and shoulders above any other restaurant in the area. The front desk staff, the wait staff, and the bus staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. The food is prepared quickly and I am always able to get in and out for lunch in less than 45 minutes. When I have a big group the staff always accommodates us and we always leave satisfied. I will continue to support this wonderful business and I will always recommend it to my friends!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, always packed so expect a wait if you're going in the evening for dinner.   I love their sopapillos, the chorizo ones, the carne asada sopapillos are not that great. Their chips and bean dip are addicting so prepare to be stared at when you continuously ask for refills lol ( it will happen) . The steak burrito and Steak Entree are also a hit. A huge plus are the home made tortillas made to order. You can even order a pack to go. I've been here several times and have ordered take out as well. On sick days I've been by to pick up their Caldo de Res. Big chunks of res and plenty of veggies.   Oh and of course you must always try a Margarita which they make pretty good ones."}
{"text":"Food: great variety and lots of vegetarian options. We tried several different salsas on our foods, and all added distinct appealing flavors to the fresh hot food.  Atmosphere: truly committed to creating an old town cantina interior--it was a true departure from the busy intersection outside and you could refocus on the food and your company. You also get to learn a little history in the menu too--cool!  Service: prompt, friendly, and offered helpful suggestions where we needed them."}
{"text":"The food was delish! The Atmosphere was great! The bar stools were horrendous, they killed our backs! Won't be sitting at the bar waiting for our table = Lost bar revenue! They need additional parking, circled their inadequate,  small parking lot for 20 minutes,  1 handicapped spot! Great food, but not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"Table side guac is great, distinctive mexican dishes prepared with care.  It looks as good as it tastes.  Lunch is a little less money, but the real deal happens with the full menu.  Also like the guitar man and it is busy, but a nice atmosphere.  Second time there and I'm bringing my mexican son-in-law back next time.   I vote yes."}
{"text":"I have been there 5 times and great time. They are pretty fast a lunch. Food has been very good each time. Absolutely nothing negative to say about the place."}
{"text":"My family ( husband, 3 kids under 12) came here from yelp recommendation.  First of all the service was absolutely amazing!   We got the guacamole and they make it table side! Food was very good. I got the shrimp enchiladas and they were very tasty.  I was already so full from the yummy soup and chips and dip that I had to take most of it to go!"}
{"text":"Clean, great atmosphere. I love that they bring out refried beans with the salsa! I wasn't a fan of the salsa, or the soup they brought out. My chimichanga was delicious and so was my husband's enchilada, taco, and tostada. We definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and just barely beat the rush. It was just after 11 am and the parking lot filled up quickly. Inside the dining area there is an okay amount of room with options for a booth or table, but sometimes there is still a small wait to be seated since it gets so busy. There was a good amount of staff on hand to take care of the customers and during my visit our server checked on us often. We started with complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip. The salsa had a fresh taste, but I didn't care for it and it was think instead of thick which I personally prefer. Chips and bean dip were great. The beans really had a nice flavor.   The menu has a lot of options. On the back of the menu there were over 30 different combinations for lunch specials. The specials run from 10 am - 5 pm Monday thru Friday with prices ranging from $8.95 - $11.95 and meals include rice, beans and drink. Priced at $9.95 I chose a beef taco and cheese enchilada. The taco was filled with a nice portion of shredded beef and had tons of freshly grated cheese. I loved the taste of the taco shell and all of the cheese, but the beef lacked flavor for me. The cheese enchilada was really good and they didn't skimp with cheese inside or out. The beans like the dip didn't disappoint however there could have been more cheese on the beans. The rice was a bit dry, so I'll just get all beans next time. I was stuffed at the end of my meal and satisfied. Solid spot for lunch or dinner and great for the whole family."}
{"text":"As good as it gets indeed! I've been to this spot before but only for a few drinks at the bar. I knew I wanted to come back and try the food as the place always had a good friendly vibe. I am so glad I finally did! The food was amazing. I'm from San Diego and my girlfriend is from El Paso, so we are very accustomed to the cuisine from both nearby border cities of Tijuana and Juarez. If you are looking for flavorful authentic Mexican dishes then Viva Zapatas is your spot! The service was top notch. Our waiter always made sure that we were well taken care of. When we were finished and asked for a box to go, the bus boy came over and packaged it up for us which was a very polite gesture. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Party of 8, sat right down, salsa dip and bean dip are addicting and the chips came out just made fresh. Service is excellent and the atmosphere is cozy. Loved it. 20 years in Vegas and still my favorite."}
{"text":"What a great place! Even though it is far out in the North East Vegas areas well worth the drive.  I had the pollo con rajas!  Served with rice and beans and fresh home made tortillas! You just can't go wrong or get more authentic. When you are in the mood for some home cooking and you don't feel like taking the pans out this is a great place!"}
{"text":"I didn't like the food here. The salsa literally smelled like farts and the main dishes were just average. The waitstaff took forever to get us drinks and then forgot about us after our food was dropped off. Super disappointed especially in the salsa the most. Yuck."}
{"text":"Move-over, Lindo Michoacan! These guys are legit! Ask for the guac dip, AMAZING! Love the decor, the Tia Maria making the hand made tortillas in the back, the music, the staff is wonderful.   I love absolutely everything on their menu. I've tried almost everything. Green Chilaquiles, Carne Asada, Fideo Soup, yummmm....Everything is good.  I hate that to come here I have to drive 45 + minutes from Henderson. :-( If ever in the North side of town and in the mood for some good, authentic Mexican, try this place.   UPDATE REVIEW:   After coming back a few times after writing my last review, I can't help to notice how much the quality of the food has gone down.   As a faithful customer of this place, I can say it is NOT what it used to be. They are so busy, service is terrible. The food now lacks authenticity. Tastes like they cook everything on the same pan.   Sad to see this place slowly start to slack and lose something so good...because they had it for a while. Hope things improve. I will not come back soon and spend $17 on a mediocre dish.  Step it up, Viva. Lindo Michoacan is starting to sound better than your place. :-/"}
{"text":"Came here for a date night. The food was alright, the environment was nice, but the service sucked. The server didn't introduce himself and never came back to our table after taking the order. I'm all about good service and we just didn't get it here. Super bummed."}
{"text":"Fantastic and authentic food.  Great atmosphere and margaritas.  The wait staff is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The food and wait staff were excellent. The food was authentic and plenty. Started off with great tasting chips (not the store bought ones), a smoky flavored salsa and bean dip. Then a small cup of delicious soup followed by my lunch.  The entree was very good. The staff was very attentive. I am very suspicious of Mexican food being good since I live in CA and Mexican food is a staple. I highly recommend this place for an off the strip experience with normal prices. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been trying to locate good Mexican in Las Vegas and this place takes it! This place is real home-made Mexican food! It's not too fancy though, I'm not about to shove out $20-25 for a carne asada plate when $10-15 seems more reasonable.   I had the green enchiladas with chicken and they were delicious. The chips, the refried beans, and the rice were great! I wasn't a fan of the salsa that came with the chips, but that's just me. My friends liked it and I'm a firm believer that you really can't have it ALL.   The service was professional and attentive. The setting was a little loud, but when I go to a Mexican restaurant I expect to have live (or some form of) music and to enjoy the general \"ambiente\".  This place had just that.   I will definitely be back with adults only to have some adult beverages also. If I could just place this restaurant closer to my house in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend here and I have to say that the food was excellent.  The only reason I'm knocking it down was that the service was very slow.  It took some time to get our orders even though it wasn't very busy when we came in and several people who came in after we ordered got their orders first.  Thankfully neither of us had anywhere we needed to be so we rolled with it.  I would come back for the food, I just wouldn't try it when I had to be somewhere else in a certain time."}
{"text":"I love good, authentic Mexican food.  Unfortunately, I don't get to have it very often. Viva Zapatas was everything an authentic Mexican restaurant is supposed to be.  From the live music, to the very diverse menu, they really nailed it.  I had the Carne Tampiqueña (sp?), and it was fantastic.  Although cooked a little under, the quality ingredients and seasonings more than compensated...plus it probably tasted better at that temperature.  My only criticism was that the margaritas were too sweet--but that's probably reflective more of what people come in wanting.  I'll definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal!  Oh...and come on a Saturday night for the music."}
{"text":"Being a truck driver I have tried a lot of different across the country this is one of the best finds I have found being a close walk from the truck stop had the beef fajitas this trip through the beef and peppers were seasoned perfectly very generous on that part could use a little more of the beans and rice that is really the only thing it lacked on with the fresh chips and tortillas service was quick and friendly will definitely be back when I come to las vegas"}
{"text":"This place I have been coming to for awhile.. Never have I experienced hair in my food. When the Manager Ramon came out and pertained to tell me that the hair couldn't of came from his employees it came from the outside when people open the door. I couldn't but look at this man and say that is the dumbest excuse I have ever heard of WOW!!! I will not be back to this place it's a joke. Not to add the portion today was four pieces of shrimp one spoon full of rice and beans take was ridiculous expensive if you enjoy blowing money for less food then go to this place. I'm so disappointed overall. I hope the owner Lorenzo reads this and gets back to me."}
{"text":"I am still thinking about my Chile relleno and it has been hours since I ate it. The menu here is giant, with more items than you could ever hope to try in your lifetime. I would love to try all of the family recipes most of all because those are truly unique. The live music, the wait staff, and overall service are top notch. It is a louder restaurant, especially when someone has a birthday, but great for families and groups, while still maintaining enough intimacy for a possible date night environment.  The food itself shows devotion to small finishing touches and detail. Instead of plain rice as a side, veggies are mixed in. My dining companion ordered a burrito and it was nearly the size of a loaf of bread. For real, you will get enough food to take home, so be prepared to have a second and possibly third meal out of what you order!"}
{"text":"I love this place! me and the fam go at least once a month! Very friendly service plus great food!"}
{"text":"Love this place, food is awesome, restaurant is very clean.  Crunchy shrimp tacos, yummy"}
{"text":"The place is great, food came super fast, It has been hard to find a good Mexican restaurant here in Vegas, but I think I found one"}
{"text":"Normally not a huge fan of Mexican fare but I'd come back to this place perhaps every few months. Arrived during a busy lunch hour on a Friday and were seated instantly. We got the chips and three dips which were more delicious than my own meal. Ordered and got the horchata and it was made perfectly. Very authentic feel but kind of dimly lit even at lunch time. I got the taco bowl and my sister ordered a burrito. Waited a little over 35 minutes for our two entrees to come out which was kind of a long wait but we had chips so we were ok. The food was good, but I'd still prefer Chipotle. There was a birthday celebration and they sang happy birthday and brought all the servers out complete with instruments, it was fun to watch. I noticed there were many Mexicans there for their lunch, even a few construction workers and a good amount of older folks at the bar. Sadly our food took so long we had no time for dessert but overall the service was great, food was good and the wait time not the best. I recommend going at a time when it isn't busy."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Mexican food. Excellent service the music amazing. Love this place"}
{"text":"Holy Frijole, is this place good.  Las Vegans usually place Lindo Michoacan at the top of the heap when it comes to Mexican dining, but my erudite palate says Zapata's is easily just as as good, and much more affordable.  I really cannot say enough good things about this cozy little joint.  It's as authentic as it gets, and the food here is so good I don't have a go-to plate.  I always spend a good deal of time browsing the generous menu to pick something new, and it has always been delicious.  The chips and salsa are homemade, and probably laced with something illegal because it's hard to put them down.  The complementary fideo soup with an entree is a really nice touch and quite delicious.  There's a lot of complex flavors going on in what usually is just noodles and broth.  As far as the entrees go, I've never had anything that wasn't just firing on all cylinders.  Most recently I had the Camarones Borrachos entree, which was shrimp cooked in tequila, and it was absolutely delicious.  Before that I had one of the carnitas dishes and it gave me a glorious food comma.  The margaritas are also some of the best around.  My only criticism of Zapata's is the parking situation.  It's a small, crowded lot and we often have to park at the gas station next to it, but it's a minor inconvenience compared to the quality of the food awaiting inside.  Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really great Mexican cuisine! The menu has great variety and the pricing is excellent, especially if you're used to heading to Roberto's. My boyfriend and I ate and had a dessert for under $30! The service was excellent; the wait for food was pretty average but there was always a server checking on us and making sure our drinks were full.   My boyfriend had a beef burrito that was so large, he had plenty to take to work to eat! And he loved it, also said it was even better as leftovers. I ordered the carne asada mixed greens salad; there was a bit too much dressing for my liking the meat was cooked beautifully and I really liked the lime dressing. we had sopapillas for dessert and they were delicious! perfectly flaky and the sauce was very yummy. I really wanted to ask for another order!  we can here on a Thursday night (7:30pm) and there was plenty of seating and no wait, so didn't experience the rush. all in all, we really like the place and plan to come back next time we need a Mexican fix!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service try the shrimp enchiladas. Live music place is clean and nice decorated. I loved it."}
{"text":"I have ate a many Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. Viva Zaptas is by far one of the best choices I've made when searching for authentic Mexican dining. Since my first experience I have been a reoccurring customer. Prices are low although quality of food is high. Great atmosphere along with selection of music."}
{"text":"We wanted to send off a co-worker friend on her last day with a little lunchtime mexican fiesta...Viva Zapatas baby. This is not a huge place so getting ten people at a table is a real challenge on a friday at  noon. Luckily we waited no longer that 10 minutes(approx 63% of one margarita) and were seated and served good chips and salsa immediately, The service is always friendly here but sometimes is I a bit slow- not today. usually get the roast pork torta and it was great as usual plus is served with very good steak fries. Mexican food w/ fries? Yeah, Im home.  The margaritas were refreshing and delicious and the food seem to be enjoyed by all. Start to finish w/ 6 seperates checks(!) we were out in about 50 mins...plenty of time to drive back to work and nap the rest of the day away."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time after reading the reviews on yelp.  Everything was amazing.  The margaritas were tasty.  The soup was flavorful.  The homemade chips were served with bean dip and salsa.  The shrimp dishes were great including the shrimp enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing service. Fast and friendly. It's nice and cozy in there and no matter what you order it'll be delicious!"}
{"text":"Good service. I had the #1 and the chili relleno was awesome and they use shredded beef in the taco versus ground. Tableside guacamole was good. The price is.in the middle but worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent,  Cant go wrong with any dish here,  it's a upscale Hispanic restaurant with great atmosphere and hospitality. They make the guacamole in person at your table . Fresh tortillas. Be careful of the chips and salsa you will be full before your food arrives lol . The salsa is very blah in my opinion tastes funny. Most dishes here can be pricey within the $12.00 -$25.00 range. But they do have a lunch special menu with is worth catching.  Bar is located in the middle of the restaurant which you can also eat at. Parking lot is small and can be a pain to find parking if busy. The lighting is bad inside which is a missed opportunity for good pictures and food pictures.  Located near just off Craig and I-15 if your ever in the area and want some very good Hispanic food I do recommend. Go go go!"}
{"text":"We walked into Zapatas at 2 in the afternoon on a Saturday. We had a party of 5. The restaurant was virtually empty. We ordered one margarita each, and snacked on the chips and salsa; excellent. Soon we began to wonder if the order for margaritas had gone through to the bar. We inquired, and were told \" they will be here shortly\". After waiting 20 minutes, our margaritas finally arrived. They tasted great, but were not worth the $14 charge. We asked, and there were only 2 shots of liquor in them. We then waited an additional 30 minutes from the time we ordered our food. The food was presented well, but upon the first bite, we noticed something was off. The shredded chicken in my husband's taco salad tasted and smelled like tuna! We were convinced it was tuna, and the waitress said that it indeed wasn't. My husband didn't finish his meal or get anything else because it literally smelled so disgusting. Then, I noticed that my salad was missing 80% of the ingredients that it included on the menu, and that my grilled chicken was dry and chewy. Our service was great, that was the one upside."}
{"text":"On the way back to Vegas from the Manheim Car Auction at lunchtime, I searched for Mexican Food on my trusty Yelp App, and found another Comida Paradise in Las Vegas. One would think I would have had my fill of Comida after El Sombrero but as my Uncle Chuck is fond of saying, in my family Mexican Food is just called \"Food\".  To start with, the exterior looks suspect, parked in the shadow of a gas station and just off the I15 Interstate Freeway, one would expect this place to be yet another Gringo Mexican Chevy's Franchise -- but no, far from it, this place serves up some serious SouthWest Mex. I ordered the platter with chicken enchilada, taco and tostada -- y ay caramba! Sabrosa! Even if you don't gamble, it would be worth moving to Vegas and finding a home midway between this place and El Sombrero."}
{"text":"While the food here is good, the service is horrible! I'm still here at the restaurant and I've been waiting for over an hour for an order of 3 tacos. Nothing cosmic. Ordered drinks and food at 11:32 and it is now 12:30 with still no food. If you decide to come here, be sure to allow 2 hours for your meal."}
{"text":"Super disappointed w/civiche de camarones.  Seriously lacked flavor other than lime.  Nice server, loved the tableside guac & all the chips and salsa.  Entrees took forever.  Exc margarita!  I would eat there again, everyone else liked their food."}
{"text":"Viva Zapatas is Muy Bueno! YUM! (Hope I don't offend anyone with my limited Spanish...originally from Hawaii... so sorry) In Hawaii, we say \"Ono!\".  Anyways, off track, here we go with the review! The restaurant is located on the north side of town going towards the Speedway just off of I15 on East Craig located next to a gas station. It is 1 block off I15. For you folks in Las Vegas or Henderson, this Mexican restaurant is well worth the drive north.  I had lunch with some co-workers after volunteering at Three Square (I highly recommend if you like to volunteer and give back to the community). There was a bit of a wait since it was about lunchtime on a Tuesday. Plus, we had to park on the other side of the gas station. Parking spaces are very limited next to tis restaurant.  I love the ambience inside the restaurant. High ceilings and vintage decor. Cool and comfortable as well.  The food was great. I had one of the lunch specials. I had the cheese enchilada with a beef taco. It came with rice and beans. While we waited for the meals to come out, we enjoyed chips with salsa and bean dip. Good Stuff! Their regular size margarita was cool and refreshing. Glad I had the regular size, it was big as it was. I can't imagine the larger size.  So get your sombrero on and Vámonoso to Viva Zapatas soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that when you see it for the first time, second time or eighth time that you will not stop and eat.  It is located on Craig road near the I15 and right next to the Pilot truck stop on your way north. I made that mistake for to long and then finally convinced my self to try it. It has a small parking lot and even  walking to the door you are still not sure ... but when you enter - Oh Yes. The decor is rustic with historical items placed around the large dining room and bar. The booths are great and the staff is very friendly. A great atmosphere with live music on most every night. ( keyboards or guitar)  The traditional mexican food is super, the guacamole is out of sight and the sea food dishes are excellent. It is totally inexpensive and you will leave \"Stuffed to the Max  - and happy that you are.\"  It is well out of the way for most people, but if you have that need to visit the Cannery Casino, it is right on the way and should not be missed.  Just don't let the location throw you off from the enjoyment of a supurb mexican dining experience."}
{"text":"Somewhat perplexed by the recent negative reviews I have read.. I have been dining there for over ten years and have been pleased with the service and the food quality."}
{"text":"This place is prefect for every possible occasion. Coworkers and I meet here once a week to wind down and enjoy each other outside if work. Lunch time couple get busy. Would recommend ordering ahead of time. Parking lot could be bigger."}
{"text":"Salsa waa funny tastinglike really acidic and menu was very hard to readhad to read description on every iten each nenu item was given a name thathad nothing to do with wat it is  , tacos wer ok but bland n salsa was horribleso couldnt put it on my tacos. Wifes carnitas had bones in it she didnt eat it"}
{"text":"My Son and I were in the area volunteering at Three Square and decided to stop by here during our lunch break.  The parking lot was packed and we had to wait around 10 min for our table....this was at 12:10 pm, the worst time to be heading to lunch.  The wait was worth it though.  Once we were seated we browsed the menu and decided to order the Queso Fundido w/Chorizo appetizer ($6.95), Beef & Bean Chimichanga lunch special ($8.25), and Pollo Amador lunch special ($10.25).  I also asked the waiter if the cook could put together a really spicy Habanero Salsa for us....he said sure.    We were served complimentary Chips, Salsa, and Beans while we waited for our food....+1.  The Salsa reminded me of the Salsa at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  I read the menu that had the story of Zapata, but couldn't find any connection between the restaurants.....the Salsa was that close to one another.  Anyway, it was really good.....had a nice kick to it.  The Chips weren't as fresh as I like them to be....but they were good.  After a short wait our Queso Fundido came out....again, it reminded me of the one at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  It was very delicious.  On top of the dish is an extremely hot Pepper....I think it's a grilled Jalapeno or Poblano (see pics)....whatever it is, I like it.  I ordered the Beef & Bean Chimichanga and it came out a few minutes later....along with the Habanero Salsa.  The Beef was shredded and very delicious, not greasy.  Sometimes when you order a Beef Chimichanga it can be very greasy....not here.  It was a nice size too.....must be their lunch portion.  The Habanero Salsa was really spicy....just how I like it!  It added to the flavor.  My dish also came with Guacamole & Sour Cream and a side of Refried Beans & Rice.....all very good.  My Son enjoyed his Pollo Amador.  He gave me a bite to try it out.  It is Chicken marinated in Amador Sauce (whatever that is).  The Sauce had a slightly sweet tomatoey flavor to it.....it was very good.  Overall, it was a nice lunch.  Will we return?  If we're in the area and in the mood for some Mexican Food....you can count on it."}
{"text":"i loved their food!!!!!!! Amazing worth the price!!! I got some chille rellenos!!! And it was the bomb!!!!!!!! The atmosphere is great!!! amazing customer service!!! I definitely recommend coming here! Its amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here a couple days ago and it was delicious. The mole sauce was great and the chicken was tender and juicy. The service was excellent, everyone was friendly and wore a smile on their face. I really enjoyed and appreciated the fact that this restaurant gives free chips, salsa and beans for dipping! In addition to that, the server even brought my son a cup of fideo soup for free ( he mentioned kids receive a free cup). I thought this was very nice of the restaurant staff and owner(s). I will definitely come back here and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Loved this hidden gem! Definitely felt like I was at home. Customer service was amazing"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful restaurant. I had the steak de cognac and that was super bomb!! The sangria is really good as well.  I loved the love music during dinner. It was a great environment!"}
{"text":"Came with my family to eat at this restaurant their service is not that great,  their food is ok I paid $123 waited over an hour and a half for my food to come to our table, they try to make it up with singing a happy birthday song and bringing fried ice cream with some Churros that does not make it okay. I just left and not really happy with this place they did not even bother to give a discount, not satisfied with their service and not coming back."}
{"text":"A laid back and relaxed vibe. With prompt and courteous servers (I was served by Roberto). Delicious food; the organic margaritas taste just like the ones I make at home. Definitely recommend and will be returning."}
{"text":"Went for dinner for the second time on the one on craig rd , parking is bad bad  and the food was not so hot . Asked for a chile Verdi  burrito and it looked like a enchilada rolled on my plate . Was bad food  I have had better Mexican food at other places . Won't be going back and also pricey they raised their prices on some dishes that are valued at 2 or 3 dollars less ."}
{"text":"Woo Hoo! I finally found a mexican resturant that is good in this town after 8 years of searching. Too bad it is on the opposite side of town. I loved the atmosphere and music. The chips, salsa and bean dip was sooo good I could not stop myself.The chili verde was so tender and full of flavor and the margaritas were fresh and not made with crappy sweet & sour. I will be back hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican, hands down.   For starters, the homemade chips, salsa and beams are incredible. I don't even like retried beans, and I couldn't stop eating them. The salsa is thicker and slightly spicy - delish.   Margaritas are some of the best that you will let past your lips. Whether you prefer frozen or on the rocks, they are delightful and hard to refuse a refill.   Fideo soup. Fideo soup! This soup will keep you coming back for more, as they have truly ramped up the flavor. It is perfectly clear that they have poured love into the broth. It's delicious!  Do not get the tacos al pastor if you want to be able to eat them somewhere else. The flavor is knock-you-on-your-ass good. The meat bursts on your tastebuds just before the pineapple sweetness starts to tango. It's phenomenal. I will never be able to order this anywhere else.   The service was impeccable. The staff constantly checking and asking you how you are enjoying it, refilling beverages and truly interested in your visit. They will box your food for you, and everything is fine with a genuine smile. The live music on Friday nights brings together the circle of authenticity.   So where is the fifth star? In the non-existent parking lot. This is the only improvement that needs to be made. We parked at the gas station, and we're lucky to get the last spot on the whole block.   We're stoked that this place is right down the street from us, cuz we will be back - frequently!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I had the combo number 3. It came with a burrito, taco, enchilada, rice, beans, and a soup before the meal for $13.50. It was an awesome portion and I took about half of it home. Definitely a good deal. The ambiance of this was also nice. Lights were dim, candle on the table, earthy colors, lots of decorations, live solo guitar player playing music. Huge menu, lots of choices. Overall authentic Mexican restaurant that provided a good deal and pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"The ultimate Mexican food.  Saw the reviews and had to try it to beleive it.  The service was very good and waiters/waitress were very attentive and courteous.  Once the food arrived, it was very appealing, served and tasted the bomb.  Im convinced this is the best Mexican food here."}
{"text":"We heard a lot of goods things about this place and have been wanting to try it . Finally did and from the  beginning to the end the experience was awsome. Great quick service . They are on top of it and great food, I got the pork torta. I will definitely be coming back. A must try place."}
{"text":"Tip the guitar man he is awesome, along with everything else about this establishment.  Huge tequila selection, cute and friendly barkeeps and super cool staff.  AWSOME draft beer selection and reasonably priced menu.  I say stop in and try to prove me wrong."}
{"text":"Viva Zapata's has been our go-to Mexican restaurant since '09. Why haven't I reviewed them?  Because I'm selfish :)  You can't go wrong here. Anything and everything is good on their menu. Try not  to have too much of the complimentary chips, salsa and beans or you'll run out of space for your main dish. My little one prefers to have her birthday dinner here every year. She loves the attention and of course the birthday churros!  Service is always top notch. Ask for Jesus, he is awesome. Can't complain about anything, really. If you do go for dinner, I suggest making a reservation because it can get really crowded."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and the authentic look and atmosphere. Definitely a nice place to take a date and enjoy great food!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, good decor, the chips came out warm, the soup that comes with every meal was great, the fresh made tortillas were amazing. I'm really impressed, definitely 5 stars, very cool!"}
{"text":"This Mexican food did not disappoint!   From the start with chips,  bean dip and some awesome roasted tomato salsa. ..so good!   Could fill up on that alone!   Then the meal was great.   Had some tacos that hot the spot.   Would go back for this chips and dip in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Muchas Gracias Viva Zapatas for the Military Discount! Emiliano would be proud!  This restaurant is located near Nellis AFB and I've passed by it a million times.  From the outside it looks like a small bar type restaurant but surprisingly it's a nice little decorated place that serves up some great meals!  Chips and salsa were very good and you also get a side of hot dipping beans.  The service was so wonderful.  Speedy and friendly and between the waiter and the bus boy they were always checking in on us and refilling our iced teas.  We ordered off the lunch menu and everything was under $10.  I had the enchiladas and they were tasty and full of flavor. The Tortas here are wonderful (Mexican sandwich-mmm delicious).  I'm so glad we finally stopped in and I can take it off my bookmarks list and put it on my \"Regular's\" list because I will be back!  Viva Zapata!  What a great name!  Military discount (for Active Duty member only) w/ valid ID."}
{"text":"Surprise, surprise....weird! Ok so we passed this place everyday on the way home for 11 months and each time I say, ugh I just CAN'T eat next to a gas station or it looks ghetto. LOL OOOOO How wrong I was. So I gave in and we decided to eat there. O.M.G. Yum! I got the green pork plate, taco, enchilada and burrito. YUM! The staff was friendly, food was perfect, I love their bean and salsa sauces with the chips! Only bad thing is the Cadillac Margarita was THE best drink I've had in a while. Should be because the drink alone was $18!!! #$%$%^ yea....no prices on the menu always mean $%^$%^& on the bill....but other than that I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time here and let me tell you it's one of the best Mexican food places I ever been. Food was delicious and service and excellent. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Ok so the quality of food seems to decrease with every time we go there. I don't know but the last 2 times I went to Viva Zapatas, I left the restaurant a little disappointed. Today we tried the Nachos and they were not that good for close to $10. I have had better ones at Robertos.   Also, last time we were there and asked for military discount, the guy told us they give discount only if we are in uniform. After we asked him to go ask the manager he came back with a split check and wanted to give only my husband the 10%!!! WHAT? Then I said, well I have an ID too and then he had to go and fix the bill again."}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing!!! It's authentic Mexican food! The place is so clean and the waiters are very nice and helpful.  Next time were in Vegas, we're here!!!!"}
{"text":"I just order an enchilada to go and when I get home it doesn't taste good too dry and no flavor I'm only 4mins away thinking of finding a good 1 around the house but this place is not for me thank you and I won't be back"}
{"text":"Finally -- made it to VZ tonight.  Had the guac -- yep, they had tomatoes, so rolled the dice...feelin' fine!  The margs were great, took PA's advice about the sarandeado sauce, too -- but had it on the shrimp...if you've not had it before, it's such a treat, particularly with their homemade flour tortillas - yowza.    We also took the advice of Chris R --ordered two shrimp tacos -- but they were not in a league I'd consider worth reordering.    And we had an a la carte relleno -- which was damn good (I'm a serious green chili fan).   The menu is huge.  The bar is, too.  The dining room isn't that big, but we got there at 6:30 tonight (Friday) and sat right down.    Let's chat a second about where it is -- going north, you'll exit Craig Road -- and that's badly marked...(seriously, just remember, to take the exit after Cheyenne.)  Then you'll turn right at the end of the ramp, but you'll need to turn left at the first light -- then take an immediate right into the parking lot with the Pilot on your left...  trust me, finding the street number is impossible.  The menu is very similiar to the other Michoacans -- which means you'll get bean dip and salsa with your chips when you sit - and the other thing I've found pretty consistent about the Michoacans is that service is really terrific.  They're eager to please, happy to replace anything if it's not to your liking -- and the prices are reasonable.    All in all, for a 110 degree day in Vegas, a trip to Craig Road for a frozen marg and some tasty dishes, that I honestly hadn't ventured to try at the others, made us happy.  There are certainly plenty of interesting dishes on the menu that caught my eye -- so I'd go back - and since we've got a Michoacan pretty much down the street (Viva), that's saying something.     Gracias, Poly."}
{"text":"Great food , and amazing margaritas . We had a discrepancy in our bill and the Manager Ramon was quick to rectify this situation . We will be back . * Happy Hour 2 for 1 prices."}
{"text":"order the coca-cola pork, you're welcome."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. A little pricey. This is where the hubby wanted to go for his birthday. It's a ways from our house in Centennial. We all liked our meals, but it's not somewhere I would drive so far to get. If you're near by check it out."}
{"text":"Wow what an awesome meal. I had the chicken cognac and my husband had the rib eye with cognac. Very delicious!!! The meat was tender on the steak. The chips and salsa were accompanied by beans and fideo. The fideo was so good, very soup like, and very delicious. The main thing I would want to express is the attention to detail, especially the service was 10 stars. the staff all works together and they are on point. We never had to worry about our glasses being empty. The same thing with the chips and salsa and bean dip those never were empty. This place deserves all the stars asked then some. You will not be disappointed coming here to eat."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on my birthday and it was great! I had the chilaquiles rojos with the 2 eggs! Delicious! The chips and salsa with bean dip were excellent! The staff was prompt and friendly! The menu gives you the history of Emiliano Zapata which was entertaining to read about. Will definitely go back to try some dinner entrees!"}
{"text":"I love this place there pollo sarandeado I think I got that right is the best tasteing plate ever. Usually I get full with there chips bean dip and salsa and only eat half my plate, but this place is very good. ohh and I always take there flan to go I have never tasted a better flan than theres."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. I arrived during the late lunch hour which was a mistake. I parked in the back and was getting looks from the tennant so decided to move. I lucked out BC it was close to 1:00 and someone was leaving.   Once seated I received their signature warm bean dip, salsa and tortilla chips - so addicting. For my entree I selected the lengua with red sauce rice and beans. The portion was generous and the taste was delish. The home made corn tortillas hit the spot as I made my own lengua tacos.    The service here was spot on - friendly and refills without request. I can understand why Zapatas Mexican restaurant was voted best of Las Vegas and will certainly return."}
{"text":"Hungry for a grilled chicken salad on a Friday night and stumbled onto this place through Yelp. Phoned in the order and had great customer service. I ordered the Supreme salad with grilled chicken and asked if they had Chipotle Ranch dressing to go with it. She said no, but we can make it. Very accommodating and the food was delicious!  The home made chipotle ranch was the bomb! Overall excellent food and service. I'll be going back before I leave Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yes,  Viva! Zapata's is right.  I have been to this place 4 times so far.  I live in California otherwise I would be there every week.  The food is incredible.  Authentic mexican food, with tons of flavor!  The service is superb.  Chips and salsa are on point.  They also bring you bean dip and fideo as a starter. Order the guacamole, they make it table side from scratch.  Real avocados, jalapenos, lime, garlic, cilantro, etc.  It is soo tasty.  I have been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Everything I have eaten from seafood to machaca has been great.  I will go there everytime I visit Las Vegas. You should try this place as a good alternative away from the strip and alot more economical.  P.S.  Homemade tortillas!!  That's reason enough to visit this place!"}
{"text":"The table side guacamole is amazing! The vegetable fajita was very good and the fresh tortillas that they make on site are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food with great service. The lunch specials are a steal but it's crazy packed at lunch time so go early or you won't be able to park let alone get in."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and it might just be my last. I decided to eat at Viva Zapatas over Que Mas mexican restaurant and I totally regretted it.  I ordered the 2 tacos combination plate with rice and beans and it was an epic fail, because this place is stingy with their meat. No joke!   There was about 2oz of meat in both tacos combined and it was disappointing to say the least. No flippin wonder there was an avalanche of lettuce in my tacos.   I paid about $12 for a crap load of rice, beans and taco shell and very very little meat. In all honesty I hate it when restaurants are stingy with their ingredients.  I was still hungry so I ended up ordering 2 additional tacos and 1 tamale and made sure to tell the waiter to ask the cook to put more meat this time around.  When the tacos and tamale came out I would quickly find out that this time around wasn't going to be any better. Even though there was more meat it tasted horrible. The beef in the tacos were super dry and the tamale was probably the worst I've ever had in my life... seriously.  Overall this was probably the worst mexican food I've ever had and I'm just wondering why in the heck it's a 4 star joint.   In a nutshell this was memorable in a very very bad way and I'm definitely crossing this joint off my foodie list for good.  Thanks but no thanks VZ!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here based on helpers. One of best chili rellanos I've had in a long time and the chicken taco salad was very good but the soup was lousy so pass on that... nice place to come too if your passing by"}
{"text":"Authentic great tasting food combined with amazing service makes this place worth a visit! I had the combination platter which included a crispy chicken taco, Green chille pork burrito, and a beef enchilada (including rice and beans). Every bite was savored and have absolutely no complaints about this place. My co-worker drank about 6 horchatas being that as soon as she was done with one, the server would immediately grab another (Now that's service)!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service!  Nothing to complain about the Restaurant itself, the outside area unfortunately is not the most safest part of town. But if you venture out to North Las Vegas I recommend you stop by for some delicious authentic style Mexican food."}
{"text":"My favorite local restaurant in Vegas! I love this place. Their homemade flour tortillas are fantastic, and so is the salsa and bean dips that come complimentary with every meal.   Go at lunchtime Mon-Fri if you're looking to save a few bucks - their lunch menu starts at $8 or so."}
{"text":"We heard about this place and decided we had to try it out. Drove way the hell out Craig in N Vegas to find it. Place is dark inside and decorated with a cross between Mexican Revolutionary and Farmer. Staff was very friendly and actually very good. We ordered appetizer of the Quesadilla that was damn good. Also the chips, salsa and bean dip that was great as well. I had the Enchilada, Taco and Burrito combo. This was good, only drawback was kinda room temperature, not hot. The parts that I ate were very tasty. Scary when the meat is only room temperature, so doubtful that I will return."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy this place. As a business traveler if you find yourself returning to the same spot rather than seeking out new locations, you know that there has to be something special about it.   Lets start with the salsas. Obviously homemade you get a red salsa with a bit of a kick and a refried bean salsa. I'm not the biggest refried bean gal, but I do really like this salsa. Last time I was here I finished that bowl...  I had 2 enchiladas with mole sauce and carne which the meat was perfectly seasoned and the cheese was stretching out of the enchiladas like a perfectly melted cheese should. Mole sauce had great flavor and punch and elevated the enchiladas to a new level.  Service was great, the lone guitarist was playing all night long and everyone was super friendly. Great atmosphere and highly recommended."}
{"text":"The guacamole at Viva Zapatas is absolutely delicious, made form scratch, and made to order. It's a meal in itself!!!   You get bottomless chips so be careful and save room for the delicious pork, beef, chicken and seafood options Viva's menu offers.  NOTE: parking is limited especially during busy hours, additional parking can be found behind Zapatas.   Staff: courteous and friendly   Seating: only indoor, plenty of room for large parties. Bar area has stools and seating for approximately 20 people.   Full bar, lots of tequila brands.   Dress code: casual   Menu: lots of options! I've never had a bad meal here. I'm a big fan of the carne asada, and the chimichanga.    Service: the service is usually quick, but at peak hours (lunch) you may have a little bit of a wait.  Make sure you've got more than an hour to eat, if you're going to stop by at lunch time.   Bottom line, if you're looking for good Mexican food this should be one of your stops."}
{"text":"We love this place! :) The food is awesome. I had the ceviche and practically licked the plate. It is the perfect summer time food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Soup was an unexpected surprise, tacos came arranged in holders, and price was very reasonable: The cost of sushi for one fed two of us.  Service was great.  I've only been here once so far, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We're visiting from San Diego and read the reviews from previous customers and knew we had to try it. THIS PLACE DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The service was top notch and never let my drink get below half. The servers were very attentive and polite. The food was excellent very generous portions and very tasty. The chips, beans, and salsa was really good and so was the complimentary soup. Next time we're in Vegas again we will definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Longest wait ever.... Won't be doing lunch there again I sure hope the food is good!!!"}
{"text":"Viva Margaritas! I ventured to this spot for Happy Hour with some co-wokers one Friday afternoon. We chose this place specifically for their HH drink specials...2 for 1 margaritas! Ay yai yai!! Annnd, they were actually tasty...not too much sweet and sour, just the right amount! Unfortunately there are no HH food special (tear). : (   Coming from San Diego, it has been difficult to find authentic Mexican food, but Viva Zapatas was one of the better ones I've found so far in Vegas.  I ordered the taco plate with beans and rice. Unfortunately I can't recall the three different taco meats I ordered, but I remember all of them being tasty. The rice was prepared well, but my favorite were the refried beans and homemade chips they brought out when we sat down...yummy!!! Another traditional touch that I appreciated was the fideo soup that accompanied my meal. I could have slurped that soup all night....delicious!!   The ambiance was enjoyable as well. Traditional colors and decor with classic Mexican tunes in the background. I believe the server mentioned that they have occasional live musical performances, so if that peaks your interest I would call prior to confirm. The service was good, nothing above and beyond, but certainly friendly. The only downside of this place is that it is fairly pricey for traditional Mexican food. Thank goodness for their HH margarita specials!"}
{"text":"My hopes were very high with the rave reviews. I'm still on the hunt for the best carne asada burrito in Vegas.   Carne asada burrito Zapatas special- 3 stars. The special has sour cream, guacamole, and some other stuff inside. It was okay...I've had better.  Beef chimichanga- 5 star. It was my friend's dish and it was def better than mine. It was fried to perfection and the shredded beef was delicious!   Free chips and salsa- super super good. I almost want to say their chips are the best I've ever had. I keep saying that it seems, but I swear these are reaalllllllly good chips. The salsa was good, only because it has a major kick to it.   Service was excellent.   I'm giving 3.5 stars. I'll be back for the chips and the chimichanga someday."}
{"text":"I waited an hour and a half to be served I saw three tables that came in 20 minutes after I did and left way before I even left very unprofessional but the food is still really good"}
{"text":"Best mexican food hands down! Every time food is super tasty, great portions, & cozy atmosphere. Waiters are always attentive & love that there is always a musician playing to keep the vibe alive."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé come to eat here every other weekend. we love to sit at the bar since the service there is great. The food is delicious. I have probably tried every shrimp plate on their menu and they are all good but my fave is Shrimp Fajitas! you have got to try those if you go here. Their margaritas can be a bit strong but that's  not a problem with me... For sure they get a 10/10 from me. :)"}
{"text":"We read all the reviews so we had to try for ourselves! I was craving some legit Mexican. I ordered the Carne a La Tampiquena and my husband had the Pork Carnitas. It was good but maybe I expected way TOO much from all the reviews. I enjoyed my cheese enchilada (that was served on the side of my meal) and margarita the most! They have a great happy hour deal and beers on draft. I liked that their tortillas are freshly made (you can see the woman towards the back cooking them). However, I walked away feeling like I missed something. Great service, good food but maybe I ordered the wrong thing since everyone else is raving?!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I ever had anywhere.  Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere. You can't go wrong here. Ate and drank here twice in two days and I will be back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"First impression was nice.  The hostess was very friendly and professional. She greeted us and offered us a carrier for our babies car seat so that was a plus.  She sat us down and not to long after we had our waiter take our drinks. They handed us chips and salsa right away. We placed our order and munched on the chips and salsa which was pretty yummy.  But the wait just to get our food was pretty lengthy. We ended up getting full off of the food because of the wait. So when our food finally came it was nice and hot.  I ordered the steak enchilada mole. One bite and it was so overly stuffed with cheese.  Almost to the point where it made me sick. I could bearly taste the mole.  I Know that I will never ordered this again. I also had the Carne asada salad. It was overpowered with lime. It had no flavor. Another thing I will not order again.  My son had the steak cognac.  I took a bite and it was good they cooked it med rare perfect. My husband had the shrimp and it was cooked just right also and there was good flavor.  If it was based off service alone I would put another star.  Maybe I'll come back and try a different item but so far I was not impressed with my food."}
{"text":"Such great food here!!! We have been coming for years and they never disappoint. The margaritas are wonderful and I love their fish tacos! Salsa comes with beans on the side too! The live music is a plus!!"}
{"text":"From now on my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. Not only for its authenticity but its friendly service and of course the rich and savory dishes. Give it a try and your palate will thank you. Just saying. :)"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Cadillac margarita obscenely priced at $17.50."}
{"text":"Best queso fondito with chorizo i have had in Las Vegas. Good mojito's and margaritas. Friendly staff. Good atmosphere. Pretty good al pastor but not the best. Would come to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for \"antojitos mexicanos\". Real Mexican Food. When no time for grilling I usually stop here for carne asada patron. Delish. Not to mention their margaritas!  One of the best places to go for frozen margaritas.  Only down side is the wait time. This place is always crowded but the wait is well worth it.  Customer service not quite the best but good food."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, Service and Food!  This place hits the marks on all three, from the moment that you enter the place you feel instantly relaxed, like your in an old mexican cantina, the service is top-notch! very team oriented, from the second that you take your seat a server is getting your drinks while another  is bringing you chips with two types of dips which are both awesome btw followed by yet another person with tomato soup! really well orientated. The food is delicious, I've had the fish tacos and camarones adelita there both great! bursting with flavor served in oversized portions, come hungry and be prepared to roll out of this place. My only gripe is the prices which can be a little on the high side, the camarones adelita is almost in the $20 range.  All in all, some of the best Mexican food I've ever had."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for a date night & over all it was a very nice experience. The good things were the main courses & the service. The down side was the taste of the salsa that came complimentary with chips & some refried beans. The salsa had a very strange taste but since it was free we didn't see any reason to complain. My wife had the Shrimp enchiladas & they tasted great, I had the Lengua Revolution & it was friggin awesome. Lengua can either be really good or really bad. At Zappata it was wonderful, so tender you could have. Lien on it to cut it. Overall a wonderful dinner & atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place was a complete surprise and really really good.  Service was excellent, the food to include the free chips, salsa, and bean dip was excellent.  I love that they make their own tortillas.  This is the type of place you'd find in San Diego.  I can't stop thinking about it since we went a few days ago, so we are ordering carry-out tonight for dinner.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"I have to be real and blunt I absolutely love this place but there are some big con's that forced me to dock some stars.  Atmosphere:5/5 It doesn't get more authentic than this. When you walk into this restaurant you feel like your in Mexico. It looks like an old Mexican tavern. Dim lighting with a guy in the corner with a guitar jamming away. Honestly the vibes of this place was awesome! The bar was more than fully stocked. With your \"American vodka's\" and a WIDE WIDE selection of Tequila's.   Service: 3/5 The service felt very homey, like I had a Mexican mother cooking me home made Mexican food. The food was very wholesome in HUGE portions. I literally had no Idea where to begin. So I started in the middle and ate my way out. LOL Service at the bar could've been a bit better. I went during peak dinner hours so I guess that's why they neglected us. I noticed my group didn't get any bar tables stands for our plates like other groups so we ate directly on the bar.  Also our complimentary salsa, chips, and pinto bean dip ran low. I wasn't sure If I could as for more because it was complimentary \"well so I thought it was\"   Food: 4/5 First the salsa, chips, and pinto bean dip. OMG was super delicious. The salsa was average but the bean dip was very tasty. but don't fill up on the chips. Next comes the pre dinner soup, not sure what it was but it was very bland. It looked spicy but it wasn't. Now the meal, it was very heavy, when I say heavy. I mean fatty, cheesy, and oily. I literally had to push around the cheese to get to anything. It was EVERYWHERE kind of an over load. The cheese enchilada lacked flavor, and on my 3 combo plate (1 tostada, 1 beef taco, 1 enchilada). The beef on the taco was shredded like pulled pork. It seemed more like a carnita. The tostada was very fresh because it was topped off with a big glob of guacamole. YUMMMM   Drinks: 4/5 The drinks were just right. Not too strong, not too weak. A perfect blend. I ordered a margarita because I felt.. I needed to indulge fully into Mexican culture. It was a perfect combo to my meal.   Pricing: 3/5 My order was $13.95 a bit pricy for the Area of town it's in. But It was understandable because the food was good. The atmosphere complimented the food well. Plus it came with complimentary salsa and chips, with also this intro dinner soup.  Suggestions/Advice:  - Don't go during peak dinner hours if you want impeccable service. - Don't fill up on a lot of chips,salsa, and pinto bean dip. - Portions are huge  - TRY THE PINTO BEAN DIP it was heaven!!! - Parking might be difficult its a very small limited area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food places!  The service varies, but the food is always delicious.  Very flavorful and prepared well.  My current favorite: the shrimp tacos.  The tortillas are made on site; I could just eat them plain, they are that good.    They offer a military discount for cardholders and there is a children's menu."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch.  It was not too busy, but service was a bit slow.   We were brought a red salsa that was probably the worst salsa I have had.   It was not just me.   Everyone in the group thought it tasted like an old cleaning rag.   We asked the waiter about the salsa, but he said the peppers are roasted and that's how it is.   Requested a green sauce instead, which never came.   Someone in the group ordered chilaquiles which were very tasty.   However the meat that she ordered with the chilaquiles looked and tasted more like jerky.    I had the fajitas which were good, not great.  Overall, was not impressed."}
{"text":"Not great lighting inside.  Great live music, awesome staff, & delicious food.  Save your appetite for fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Had dinner there the other night, and the place was packed. After 15 minutes we had a table. The chips and salsa as well as the bean dip were really good, and all made fresh.  We had the fajitas 1 chicken and one beef.  Both were good, and the fresh flour tortillas made right behind us were very good.  They give you complimentary soup which was just meh, but no charge = no complaints.  All in all would go back."}
{"text":"This would be a great place to open a restaurant! Holy crap waited 45 minutes for tacos.. Cooks can only do 1 order at a time?  Enough with the chips and salsa already"}
{"text":"We went here last night with friends on recommendations we had seen. It was pretty good and the menu is very extensive but it is on the \"pricey\" side. The place is nice and clean and tastefully decorated but is also a bit on the dark side. It was hard reading  the menus.   OK back to the food. I mean come on people it's just Mexican food. Most of the specialty dishes ran from $16.99 to $18.99. The normal Mexican combination plates were prices in the $10.99 to $13.99 range."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and their margaritas are the best. They have two for one margarita happy hours and most of the time, the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I love giving high ratings when it is deserved and this place gets it. I'd give a five but 5 has got to be reserved for the \"nothing I say will do this place justice\" eatery. This dish filled me up. Company is great. Full tummy. Super pleasant atmosphere. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar because they were very busy at 330 pm. A good sign. Place was full of Mexicans, another good sign. Nice Mexican draft beer selection. Good chips and dip. The food was very good and service was very good. Had live music as well. Atmosphere is also good."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Las Vegas hands down. In addition to the best food, the staff is very friendly, professional and always have a smile when serving you. My wife and I eat there as often as we can and we always leave there full and very satisfied. Oh ya, love the live music, this restaurant is awesome. You guys keep up the good work and my wife and I and our family and friends will continue to eat there. Thank you, thank you, thank you."}
{"text":"This honestly is a little, hidden gem of a restaurant in north Las Vegas. I work right down the street so this is usually my go to place on pay day Friday's.  They have tons of lunch specials but my favorites are the taco salad and camarones con rayas y crema. The taco salad is huge and comes with everything you'd ever desire. I always mix in some of the salsa too in order to spice it up a bit. The camarones are probably my number one favorite, but they're a bit pricier around $11. This plate comes with rice, beans and your choice of tortillas. The shrimp has a creamy sauce along with some peppers. Honestly it's so good, you just have to try it!   The lunch specials here also come with a drink and one refill which is nice. The food has always been great with anything I try and I especially love their bean dip which comes complementary with any meal.   The only reason I'd give them a four star instead of five is how the service can be shoddy sometimes. It's either very good and quick or terribly slow and not very attentive. I guess it just depends what day of the week you come. Either way I'll always be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came at 330pm. It's now 355pm. There are 2 other tables that gave customers, still no waiter. Food is bomb though, I've been here when it was busy and had better service."}
{"text":"So if you have 50 dollars to kill on yourself take it to this place, they have some awesome mexican food! like real mexican food, hey im not a novice to mexican food, but this was just fantastic.. actually it tasted better than the food i had down in cabo...  So If you like mexican food and you want a good well portioned mean go here! its pretty awesome!  Oh and the tortillas are had made right in front of you!! just like in OLD TOWN SD.. perty Legit."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is awesome, there is live music and micheladas are on point! I usually sit at the bar and the ladies are friendly and attentive. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I dined here with some colleagues while in town for work.  We chose it due to good Yelp reviews.  Our reviews were a little more mixed.  We arrived on a weeknight, and I inquired about happy hour at the hostess stand.  The hostess didn't know if it was happy hour, and had to go check.  She confirmed that it was happy hour, but then took off again, and the three of us stood awkwardly in the entrance waiting for a while for her to seat us.  It didn't seem so busy to warrant that wait, but we waited a while to order and to be served throughout the night.  Our food was good, except for the ceviche appetizer.  Something about it was not right - it lacked that nice bite of lime, and the fish was not prepared like I'm used to - the consensus at the table was that it was a miss - and most of it was still in the dish when we left.  The pastor tacos were good - they had pineapple which is often left off of pastor tacos, the table side guac was a nice treat, and my friend's chicken dish was enjoyed by everyone at the table.  We also had a great server - very friendly and helpful.  The uneven service definitely affected our experience, but I would still try it again because I think they have a good menu with a nice variety of authentic dishes."}
{"text":"Favorite place ever!! Been coming here since 2002 !  Excellent service & amazing food everytime !  The know my family & our favorite dishes whenever we go. Really wonderful place. The owner has done a wonderful job."}
{"text":"Amazing food....! We had Jose as our server and he was amazing also!!! We are from California and we will be back next time to visit again"}
{"text":"This place is by far one of my favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurant. The staff is super friendly and the food is great. You should definitely try their preparada it is delish!!"}
{"text":"Looking at all my reviews you're gonna think I have a soft spot for Mexican food and you'll be right! The wait can be a little long because of the limited seating, parking can be scarce by Vegas standards and neighborhood it is in you usually wouldn't want to be caught in after dark but the margaritas and tortillas are really worth the wait and the scarce dark parking lot. Advice to management: maybe try to better utilize the parking space? Add some lights in the parking lot?"}
{"text":"My friend and I are both chefs and just got off work and my friend who WAS a loyal customer for 6 years recommend we go here for dinner. I was early and the service was great I got a drink and my chips very fast. Once my friends got there we ordered margaritas with an extra shot and they tasted like lime-ade not 1 drop of tequila so we sent it back. Once we received our margaritas again nothing changed it we couldn't taste any tequila. We ordered our dinner and it took forever to come out literally about 30 to 40 minutes we went through atleast 5 bowls of chips and dip. The buster Oscar was the ONLY reason we didn't get up and leave and he is the only reason this place is getting 1 star. Oscar was very engaging and entertaining he made us laugh and made our whole night! Once our food came I got the tacos de carne asada and it literally had no flavor or seasoning it tasted like I was chewing rubber I had to put guac and ton of salt I even dug in my margarita to get my lime to give it some taste. We were highly disappointed and to top it off my friend who is retired military and has been getting a military discount for the last 6 years they refused to give it to her because she wasn't currently active duty! We complained to the manager and he wasn't the most friendly or considerate of all managers wasn't much help at all he did reluctantly give us a military discount. The food was mediocre the service was decent the management was horrible I'd rather spend my money on taco bell... but Oscar is amazing that's the only good thing about this place... I will not be coming back and I doubt my friends will either"}
{"text":"Good customer service, good atmosphere with music in the background and great foods! This place has a festive vibe that will make your experience really enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is ok ... Not really worth it for the price though ..theres many mexican restaurants that are in vegas that are way better then this spot and about same price if not cheaper ... In that being said i dont think the food is horrible ...i just think it doesnt match up with the bill ... Personally i defently rather hit up another spot with more bang for its buck in taste .. Lil bit on the salty side ... But like i said food isnt bad its just ok ..."}
{"text":"Simply the best authentic Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, speaking as an LV native. Probably not for gringos looking for a Amer/Mex franchise but if you want great food and Margaritas, it's at the top. Try the chicken coreteado or a dozen other pollo specialty dishes. The Javiers margarita is very good as well. Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"One of the MORE authentic mexican food places on this side of town.  I love the birria there.  It never disappoints."}
{"text":"Got so excited when my husband said we could come again after church today! We ordered chile rellenos, gauc dip, chicken taco, enchilada, beef taco, tostada with guac, and some other stuff, but the main point is EVERYTHING IS GOOD! This was my second trip and we loved it;)"}
{"text":"Zapatas has decent food, but this review is about my To Go order.... $7.50+ for a \"medium\" salsa.... and No Chips!#! It was far short of a Medium. and No Chips?? Boo!!"}
{"text":"First off, we are from San Diego and are absolute Mexican Food snobs, it must be authentic or we don't bother going. I can't stand the touristy mexican food on the strip so we were excited to try this small place off the beaten path in North Vegas. We went to Viva Zapatas based on positive Yelp reviews and recommendations from the locals and this place did not disappoint. If you are asking yourself if this place is worth the 20 minute drive from the strip, my answer is emphatically \"HELL YES!\" The tableside Guac is crazy awesome, fresh homemade hot tortillas and chips. Bean dip, salsa and soup are complementary too! I had the carne asada plate and it was on-par with the best I've had in San Diego. She had the Shrimp Fajitas and they were plump, grilled to perfection and plentiful. We will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"This is a great place for great Mexican foods. They serve wonderful queso fundido with peppers! The margaritas are not super sweet. Meals come with fresh soups. Every dish I've tried has been wonderful!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local restaurants. The service is always quick and the food is wonderful. Their variety of food is definitely a delight for the senses. The atmosphere is always clean and the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our date night! & oh my god, the service was beyond excellent! Our food was amazing! They made our guacamole in front of us which I thought was awesome! The staff was quick on getting our drinks and even refilling them along with our chips and salsa! We definitely will be going again. The restaurant is pretty small, but the service and food make up for it!"}
{"text":"FD dinner at Viva Zapata's in NLV... Service was horrid... supposed to have soup with entree, they said \"You didn't get soup?\"... Waited for butter for tortilla and water so food got cold...and topper was they could have cared less... $39 tab (no booze) and NO attempt to make things right... Sad part of the story was table side guac was GREAT... can't tell about the rest of my meal as it was ICE COLD when I finally got water and butter... Viva Zapata's gave me a ROTTEN Father's Day dinner... Ole!"}
{"text":"Second time there.  The first was like 3 years ago.   Unfortunately this time left a bit more to be desired.   The hostess was very nice and welcoming,  our waiter not so much for some reason.. The other members of the wait staff were very attentive but our main waiter just sucked.... I wanted to order appetizers while we looked over the menu.  He disappeared so long that we just went ahead and ordered the main entree.  We didn't see him again until we were pretty much done.   I did mention to him I would've ordered apps if he were around. He simply walked away.   Steak fajitas were kind of chewy. My son had fried shrimp he said it was good.  Chips, salsa, beans, and noodle soup were all good.  My margarita was over priced and not that great...."}
{"text":"Prompt polite service, clean booths, pleasant live music, fresh and fast food. Just the ticket for anyone at Nellis AFB. Interior nicer than exterior."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas! They have authentic cuisines. Just ask for their specialty for beef, chicken or pork. They will recommended what the popular menus are. Be aware that portions are big enough to share."}
{"text":"Came here after NASCAR for dinner with a group of 4. The restaurant is cozy and very well decorated with pictures of Zapata and the history that comes with that. The service was great, they give you chips beans and salsa while you wait. The sopa de Fideo reminds me of moms cooking. The waiter is nice and told us that they have a full bar but no drink menu. We ordered the mango margaritas. I appreciate the salt on the rim but they skipped the salt I guess. I ordered the chile colorado. It was impressive. We also ordered fried ice cream and it was devious. The place is very busy as it is popular. I also liked the dress of the workers and also the tortilla lady making fresh tortillas! Would love to return here but it's a bit far from my area."}
{"text":"This place is great , has great food , music there is nice , Ive been coming to this place since I was little , it's my favorite restaurant and the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Can't believe it!  We have eaten here at least twice a month for a few years. ..  Totally happy with our standard breakfast order... We both get huevos rancheros.  Last 2 trips they can't even get the eggs even close.  Over medium means whites cooked and yolks runny.  Egg whites means no yolk!  Both epic fail! When we returned the RAW eggs the chef returned the eggs over hard.  brown and completely over cooked! The term egg whites suddenly is incomprehensible! So we got scrambled eggs.    He sent an obvious screw you because we complained.  They will never see another dime of business from us!"}
{"text":"Awesome cheap Mexican fare a short drive from the Vegas strip.  Who knew?  We went a bit out of our way during a day trip (between visiting Red Rock Canyon and Hoover Dam) to check out this place on the recommendation of a friend, and we were not disappointed.    The food is nothing fancy, but it's real, and it's good.  The guac is a highlight - made tableside, fresh and flavorful (at about half of NYC prices for the same).  The atmosphere is festive and the service attentive.  A ton of locals/regulars is never a bad sign either."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, delightful decor, soft Spanish music. A taste of San Antonio,  far from home."}
{"text":"This is the best, most authentic, Mexican Restaurant Mexican in Las Vegas. My partner and I ordered the veggie fajitas which came with the best warm tortilla chips, salsa and bean dip. We also ordered the guacamole made table side.   The place is named after a famous Mexican activist who stood up for the people as the government was trying to steal their homes and land. The service is also excellent. Alejandro was our server and he was amazing. As was assistant, Cesar. Thank you both for an amazing culinary experience."}
{"text":"As long as you are looking for traditional Mexican food rather than Tex-Mex this place is wonderful. The service is top notch, the food is great, and the live music gives it a flare of excitement and authenticity.  A friend of mine introduced me to this restaurant a while back and ever since then I have been huge fan. They serve things you do not get at chain restaurants like their own specialty noodle soup, which is especially good during the winter season, refried beans as a chip dip, and a array of dishes that are mouth watering.   The inside is very small and it is more of a locals restaurant than a tourist place which means that it is cheaper cost wise and you get better service. Granted you might get put in a odd spot to eat but I have found that every sitting area offers something different to look at. I love to bring my out of town guest and friends here to eat because it offers such a large variety of food items to chose from and because they always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Every time I dine at this restaurant the food is amazing and the service is spectacular! Probably the best Mexican restaurant in North Las Vegas! The lunch specials are great deals."}
{"text":"by far the best Mexican food I've eaten in a long time and I'm from the bay. I just moved to vegas and since we already ate here last time, I had the chicken mole which was amazing. The chicken was so tender and the mole sauce was perfectly seasoned. Tonight I tried the Camarones with the mushroom wine sauce which was on point. The prawns are huge from Mexico. Their chips and salsa are also delicious. I also love how attentive they are and how there is a guy singing and playing mexican music. Makes you feel like your in mexico. If you ever come to vegas,  Def try this place! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for lunch!  The food is very good, but what makes them stand out is their service.  Our glasses never got less than half full and the chips and salsa were refilled several times.  Try the #12 chicken lunch special, it is very tasty."}
{"text":"I like this place it's a wonderful place if you want to go with your family (with kids), friends, colleagues. This place is excellent and a great variety of menu items above and beyond the usual boring choices you would find anyplace else. Not to mention the amazing service."}
{"text":"Went to Viva Zapata's a couple weeks ago on the recommendation of a friend.  Every thing was tasty , we'll prepared , plentiful portions and our party of four all took some leftovers home in a doggy bag.  I tried the coca cola steak and really enjoyed it. I Also added a tostada it also was plentiful and the Pico de Gallo was the bomb.  The only reason that I'm not giving 5 stars is the service was a little bit slow even though we were doing dinner a little early and well outside their busy time.   I would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Just from walking in the place looked legit! GREAT service from to front door to the bar. Some of the best salsa I've had in a very very long time. Excellent food. Who says you need to go to Mexico to have some really good Mexican dishes. Their selection of tequila was massive .Great place a must try if ever in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not much parking and I hear there's always a wait. Never had a wait for a Mexican spot before. That's a by product of a small place and solid foot. Had the chicken and cactus. Definitely would get it again. Salsa and beans weren't bad. The chips werent my fav. Live music and traditional atmosphere. May come again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is soooo cute! The only reason I give it four stars is because our food took a little while to come out. People sat down waaaay after us and got their food before us. Not mad at all, but a little communication as to what was going on would have been nice. Our server JESUS was really sweet and had a great sense of humor! I'll be going back to try a different dish, as they have a HUGE menu!"}
{"text":"Very good place for a bean and cheese burrito. We got it just passing though town. But it was all too notch. Lots a very local place, but The place is clean and the food is great."}
{"text":"Great food & service. Have driven by there for years and finally decided we needed to give it a try, glad we did.  Guacamole as a starter. Had the Chile Verde \"Mauser\", superb! Pork cooked to perfection, verde sauce tantalized my taste buds, some of the tastiest I have had anywhere.  Grandson's loved their meals and the fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Great guacamole and fresh flour tortillas. Enchiladas and steak Chile Colorado was very good."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food (and I don't even like Mexican food all that much!). Affordable prices. LOTS of food. Well seasoned. Great place."}
{"text":"In particular for not being in a great area this place is friggin sweet!  Salsa dynamite. Shrimp was excellent. Great Guac. Solid all around."}
{"text":"We were driving through on our way to Salt Lake City and stumbled across Viva Zapatas.  It was a wonderful find.  It seems to be a big favourite of locals, as it was almost full on a Sunday at 11:00 am.  Chips were brought to the table with salsa and bean dip.  The chips are so fresh, no mistaking them for store bought, and the dips truly tasty (salsa was a bit spicy).  We had Huevos Machaca with corn tortillas, so much meat that it was hard to find the eggs.  It was very tasty but I would have enjoyed a little more pico de gallo to add some texture.  Definitely worth the detour off the I-15"}
{"text":"wow!    Service ..............5 stars Food ...............   5 stars Atmosphere......5 stars  I was completely overwhelmed by the friendly and excellent service we experienced here.  Everyone was so friendly and the service was so FAST!!!! I mean my hubbys glass was always full, food came out super fast and man was it GOOD!  I love Mexican Food and my hubby and I have been looking for a good sit down place to go.  Viva Zapatas delivered! We went on a Sunday and there was a nice gentleman playing guitar and singing traditional mexican songs. It was a great background and not too loud.  He was really really good! You can actually get fresh homemade tortillas here!!  Yummmm.    If you are in the area or in the mood... this place is a MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday. Not sure what to expect because of industrial area. Food and service was excellent. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite Mexican restaurant. There's a lot of selection and options here for food and drinks. The freshly made tortillas are especially amazing with queso fundido con chorizo. We've had everything from fish to carne to pollo to salad and soups. You get really good portion sizes and the tomato soup appetizers are delightful. In addition, you get the tradition chips, bean, and salsa with your meal which they refill. The margaritas are tasty and never had an issue with the quantity of alcohol in my drinks. They have live music sometimes but it's not as loud of a restaurant so you can still hold a conversation comfortably with your party. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Because of the reviews we found here on Yelp we stopped in today for lunch. As it turns out the food was really only AVERAGE! The wait at 12:30pm was 30 minutes so we decided to eat in the bar as you can order from the FULL menu when seated there. We ordered a Taco Salad with Shredded Beef to share. I was surprised to find the meal lacking in flavor... the beef, though fairly moist, had almost no depth of flavor.  Also, I had expected there to be some beans included with the meat (hubby didn't) and there were none. Salad-wise the lettuce was fresh and crisp. There were NO other veggies - I would have liked some onions, radish, purple cabbage and substantially more Pico de Gallo than the SPRINKLING that was included. Though there was a small scoop each of guacamole and sour cream the salad needed either an option of dressing OR substantially MORE Pico, guac., and/or sour cream. Service at the bar was spot-on!   For these reasons we feel that the best rating we can give is 3 out of 5 stars. We hope that Viva Zapata's improves their food quality so that we can stop in the next time we travel to North Vegas to go to the VA Hospital and Clinics."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the whole thing.  The meal,  the atmosphere,  the decor,  and the staff.  Truly authentic.  I will return."}
{"text":"We are new to Las Vegas from Northern California, where we were spoiled with good quality Mexican food. Again we turned to Yelp for local guidance, and found Viva Zapatas with high marks.   The location is a good 12-15 min drive from our Aliante home . Not keen or impressed with the area of this location, we almost had second thoughts...  (We are sure glad we didn't pass up this restaurant.)    Parking is limited (2) stars, as we entered there was a nice feel and layout. The whole restaurant was nicely decorated for Christmas (classy, not tacky). There was a gentleman on a stool playing live music and singing which added a nice touch.    It was Saturday night at 6 pm, we did not have to wait for a table and were seated immediately, the host was friendly and attentive. We were sat in a booth right next to the VERY busy kitchen door (1) Star, I was not pleased, and could tell this was going to be a very loud, busy spot. The table was clean, neatly set as we were handed the menus. The menu is very well put together, many quality selections. I had a very difficult time reading the menu as the interior lighting was very low. It created a very pleasing ambiance, however tough to read the menu. ( This is where the kitchen door constantly opening allowing the bright florescent light to shine onto my menu was actually handy).   We searched for a drink menu, hoping for quality specialty margaritas but did not find such items listed on the menu. Our server arrived table side quickly to take our drink order, and was able to recommend a few margaritas that sounded good. I ordered the house Cadillac Margarita on the rocks w/ salt (large) and the wife ordered a Mango margarita blended.   We had time to review the menu and make our selections, however very tough to do so. The menu is packed with amazingly described selections. I settled in on the steak fajitas (rare) and anyone who loves their meat rare knows that finding a good Mexican restaurant that will honor that request, and deliver is few and very far between, its my little test on the quality of service. My wife ordered the chicken mole, and we ordered a Tamale for the table.   Our drinks arrived, my large margarita did not let me down in size. The taste on the other hand was average, nothing special. I found myself a bit disappointed having expected a place like this to have fresh hand squeezed lime juice sweetened with a simple syrup for there mixture. This obviously was a store bought margarita mix. My wife's was tasty, but again a store bough mango mix and margarita blend used. Drinks right down the middle (2.5).   The chips, salsa, and re-fried beans provided were wonderful. Chips were warm, the salsa was hand made with quality ingredients, and the beans were also well seasoned and hand made.    Our entrees arrived with an average wait, the timing was perfect. The plate presentation and appearance was wonderful, the food looked amazing. The portions were very big, and looked like each plate was prepared with care. A nice added bonus we did not expect or order was a home made soup offered with dinner, small 6 to 8 oz portion of soup. I would describe it as a cross between a home made tomato soup and chicken soup. The flavor was very good, someone who knows what they are doing back there took time making this broth. Very flavorful and light.     Chicken Mole: The Mole sauce was very good, not as heavy and bold as expected, but certainly not a bad Mole by any means. The star of the dish was the two pounded boneless chicken breasts. Again I expected a over cooked dry chicken saved by a rich Mole sauce to cover. Not here, this chicken was amazingly moist and juicy. Rich flavor, and i highly suspect they brine the breast. It was perfectly cooked (5+) stars.    Steak Fajitas: The plate looked amazing, smelled wonderful and was sizzling at the table. The meat looked plump and not over cooked. The flour tortillas were hand made in the restaurant, warm and amazing. I took a piece of meat to test, and it was PERFECTLY cooked rare with great flavor and well seasoned. I have never been a guacamole fan, my wife gives me so much grief. I have never eaten guac in a restaurant with any meal. The way this was going, I had to try theirs. WOW, very tasty, properly seasoned and balanced with cilantro, onion, lime, and tomato. I actually used it on my Fajita roll.    Tamale: A very tasty and well balanced Tamale. The flavor was very good. The masa to meat portion was perfect,     In closing, this by far is some of the best tasting Mexican food I have had, and we have had some great Mexican in Northern California. We have found our spot when the desire for Mexican comes knocking. Great food and restaurant. The service is top notch. Even though we had some things we did not enjoy, I have to give this restaurant (5) stars for service and food. Great job, and we will be back very soon.

{"text":"So super tasty!! We came here based on the reviews and very glad we did.  Everyone was happy with his/her dish, service was great.  Will return here next time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Eat here with our counterparts. Great restaurant and food is excellent. Very busy at lunch time. Sometimes hard to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated with great service was great, the food fell short.  I was not impressed with the salsa, or chips.  There were more rocks than margarita and the soup they served was an extremely thin tomato.  The sopitas were pretty good, but not great."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and saw the reviews on yelp. We came by for breakfast and are glad we did. The service was excellent. The food was delicious. Highly recommend this Mexican food paradise."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and it's always good.  We drive a truck so we aren't there as much as we would like.  Great food!  Wish the parking lot was bigger."}
{"text":"Extremely upset.  Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious HOWEVER  ***HOW IS IT THAT MY MOTHER, WHOM DID 30+ YEARS IN THE MILITARY DOESN'T GET A DISCOUNT BUT ACTIVE DUTY DOES?!! PLEASE FIX THIS!!!***   Think about it : She sacrificed just as much IF NOT MORE time than those who are active duty. If you give a discount for military, it should be for ALL whom had served and sacrificed their time, family and well being so we can live as we please."}
{"text":"We've been stationed at Nellis for 3 years now and Viva Zapatas is our go to for Mexican. You can not beat their table side guacamole and margaritas. Our favorite time to go is during lunch as they offer fantastic and satisfying lunches.   The restaurant is clean, the waitstaff is very prompt, and everything runs very smoothly. The manager is always walking around checking on tables, and I always see the hostess wiping menus down when I'm walking in and out. The way I can really tell they're clean is by how spotless their bathroom is!   The only thing I could complain about is their waiting area is almost nonexistent and their parking lot is awful.. And once in awhile the chips we've gotten are stale, but when made known to the waiter he replaced them with fresh ones!"}
{"text":"Food is good not the best , but OMG this place has the best margaritas!!! I tried one here and I've been hooked. Bad thing you don't get comp drinks while gambling.. ;p"}
{"text":"I eat here every time Im in Vegas. Their freebie chips salsa and beans are SOO good.  They have fresh homemade tortillas...  I usually get carne asada with extra friend jalapenos.  Sooo good!!!"}
{"text":"The portions are pretty small for the price. I mean rice and beans are definitely filling your plate more than the actual meat. Overall though, it was yummy and service was great."}
{"text":"Went here with a coworker for lunch. Venue and decor was very nice for a Mexican food place. Chips with salsa and refried beans for dipping as a free appetizer. He ordered a chicken enchilada. I ordered a burrito and enchilada combo platter. Food was amazing. Prices were above \"average\". Service was top notch. Our drinks were never empty. Plates were cleared promptly. Definitely going to this place again!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for over 8 years. We totally love this place. The décor is part bar part Mexican. My kids love the bean dip (given at the beginning with chips and a very spicy salsa) and the fideo that comes with most meals it very tasty.  We haven't had anything that we didn't like. My kids also love it in the evenings (especially weekends) when there is a guy there who plays the guitar or electric piano. We always have a few extra one dollar bills for the kids to go give the performer. Fun for all!!!"}
{"text":"Viva Zapatas is a great place to go for a quick lunch during work. They have lots of space for big groups, and the service is fast (but not to the point of feeling rushed). I had the tamales and enchiladas. They actually were pretty good! You are never low on salsa, bean dip, chips or drinks at Viva Zapatas. They also have a great soup...I am not sure what it was called, but it was a like a spicy Mexican version of chicken noodle soup!"}
{"text":"I've celebrated 3 birthday and multiple events at this restaurant   Everything is absolutely delicious  The staff is not only very kind and respectful but they are also very upbeat and you can tell that they genuinely like working there   As far as the food goes I have to give all my praise to there Steak al Cognac. I huge New York steak seasoned with Cognac and drizzled with mushrooms and that buttery white cream sauce  That Paired with a Corona MeChilada. There is not any other restaurant in Las Vegas that could serve a better dinner plate"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a friday afternoon, Food was Defenitly authentic and the customer service was unbelievable. Will sure be coming back soon..."}
{"text":"To dtsrt, it was eay too dark to read the menu. Great atmosphere, pretty good wait staff, excellent margaritas and guacamole. The food is pretty fair but not so good that I  would return multiple times. Maybe once every two months or so but not every Friday for date night. Give them a try, and see if their food meets your standards. We all have different taste. This place is just not going to be my \"go to\" location."}
{"text":"Oh me oh my that was some delicious Mexican food. By far the best I have had in Las Vegas and the best I have had outside of Austin.   Only negative was my whisky and soda, however I should have known better and just got it on the rocks.   This is a restaurant and a bad drink should not dampen this amazing food, and besides the margarita I got next was spot on!   Fresh made tortillas!!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten several times at Zapatas over the last couple of years and the food has always been consistently great.  The decor leans toward the traditional Mexican restaurant with art, artifacts, and posters reflecting Mexican culture. The effect is warm, welcoming, and it just feels right. The service from our waitress, Jessica, was friendly, fast, and attentive.  In the past we've had the shrimp fajitas and they've always been fresh, hot, and tasty.  I've had the biria de chivo (goat braised in beer) several times and enjoyed it immensely, but it's not for the timid, it has a strong taste, but once you add all the condiments it's perfection.  Today we had the toreados con queso, shrimp quesadilla, and the tecala, (chile relleno and green chili pork and bean burrito).  The meal started off with chips, beans, and salsa.  The beans were addictive and the salsa was smoky and very spicy (kind of strange tasting but I couldn't stop eating it). The toreados were just awesome-cheesy, spicy, and rich. The spice level is not for the heat averse. The shrimp quesadilla was huge, cheesy, and delicious.  The chile relleno was rich and satisfying, and the pork was tender and flavorful.  My only quibbles were that I asked for all beans on the dish and it came with all rice, but that was quickly corrected, and the burrito was supposed to have beans and didn't which I didn't notice till much later. These minor issues in no way interfered with the enjoyment of the food."}
{"text":"Sorry guys- I can't be one to give this place 4 or 5 stars. The restaurant decor is very cute and the service was great. The food was too heavy for me. I got a carne asada burrito and my boyfriend had the seafood cocktail campechana along with some tacos. He said the campechana was good. I thought my burrito had too much stuff in it and that was without the pico de gallo and beans. I am sticking to mi familia for quick and easy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to take my in-laws. After reading the reviews on Yelp, we decided to try it. Was a little apprehensive about the location,  but looks can be deceiving.  The place was amazing!!! Excellent service, food was delicious, and it was wrapped up in a very authentic atmosphere!  My husband and I rarely go out for dinner and we've already gone back."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst Mexican food restaurant i have ever been to in Las Vegas, the waiting time was over an hour but that wasn't the issue , the problem was after we ordered our food they took exactly one hour and 30minutes to bring our food \"the worst by the way\" really small portions of food for the price, to refill our drinks we had to tell them 2 the 3times for them to remember. They were only fast when it was time for the check and to charge the credit card (Usain Bolt fast). Overall it was the worst experience ever i do not recommend to any one."}
{"text":"i was recently reminded of this spot and it definitely deserves a review because it was so good. it's hard to find good Mexican food spots and this place is legit. my favorite thing to order is the mole and i take some to go. i've gone a few times but not recently, but considering Mexican food option in Vegas, this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place out and it was delicious. Right from the beginning from the chips n salsa to our main course, everything was great!  We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite restaurant! The tacos are amazing and we love that they give you beans with your chips and salsa! The atmosphere is so fun and the people, service, and food are amazing!"}
{"text":"My darling husband had the brilliant idea of going to get Mexican for breakfast on Saturday.  He had stopped here during the week one day while we were moving and was pretty impressed.  I couldn't wait to try it.   We arrived bright and early, since they open at 9:00am.   We were greeted right away, and shown to our seats.   Our server, Jesus, was fast, polite, and very friendly.  We liked him a lot.    They bring out chips, salsa, and refried beans, which were all awesome.  The salsa had this amazing smokiness to it, with a good heat, and nice, thick (but not chunky, if that makes sense) consistency.    I ordered the chicken and beef enchilada, served with beans and rice.   The enchilada was great.  Both meats were shredded, tender, and full of flavor.   Smothered in delicious cheese, too.   The beans were good too.  The rice wasn't anything to write home about.  Kind of bland, and they put lima beans in it, which is really weird.    Fella had a chili verde burrito and chile rellenos.  WOWZA.  Both of these were delicious.  The Chile relleno was a little too spicy for me, but he loved it.   We will most definitely be back, I need to try a margarita!!"}
{"text":"First of all I love this place. Good food. I always come here and the Manager is very sweet. She was on it and took good care of us. Oh ya and fresh made tortillas. YUUUUM."}
{"text":"Finally got to eat here again after a couple years. I love the food here and some of the people remembered me and came up to say hi after a long absence (made me feel good, used to eat here a lot) My favorite is the Chlie Colorado &amp; Chile Verde. For breakfast you cant beat the Machaca and also great Menudo. They have a lady making the best corn tortilla's (you would swear they're flour when you look at them)  The only drawback is the Parking. Hit lunch a little early or later if you dont want to circle the lot waiting for people to leave."}
{"text":"I felt like I was at my Nani's house... the food was authentic and delicious and they kept the chips and beans flowing...but, the Fidel soup! Omg I haven't had soup that good in years!! Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and am so glad we read about it on yelp!  The service was incredible, the food absolutely delicious,and the ambience was festive. Great food at a great price!  Will be one of our favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! A small, authentic Mexican restaurant/cantina tucked away in the unlikely place of East Craig Road, you go in and the decor is comfortably rustic. The noise level was not an issue at all, very acceptable.  The food I received was perfectly done; it was a simple chicken breast marinated in lime juice and some other things I'm not certain of...BUT, the chicken was moist, not undercooked, not overcooked. Perfect!   Prices were also extremely reasonable, even the drinks weren't that expensive.  I am really looking forward to coming back here to try some more of the awesome-looking Mexican dishes...I think I may try the molé next! :)"}
{"text":"Let me preface this with I am from San Antonio, TX and have been DESPERATE to find decent Mexican food in Las Vegas. I saw the great reviews of this place on Yelp and also the parking lot seemed to be pretty busy (a good sign) so we stopped in.  We were given chips and salsa to start off with along with a bowl of beans (very very bland). I am a big fan of homemade chips since it's easy and makes all the difference...these were from a bag.  There were 5 of us so we had a pretty good run of the menu to see if this place was legit. We are also from all different parts of the country so this place was given a fair shot. We ALL thought our food was pretty bad and the service was horrible as well. I had a chicken chimichanga which I didn't eat because it came as beef. When I asked to skip the salsa on top and have them put cheese she said they had to charge me an extra $1...seriously?! Beans and rice had ZERO flavor and even my 4 year old said he didn't like his food. Also I asked for tortillas that NEVER came...we asked three people for the check before finally being able to pay for horrible food...I will not go back which is a shame because I wanted this place to live up to their hype."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican place !!! The steak al co?ac is just delicious staff is really friendly and polite all the time !! Before Jesus use to be our waiter all the time and the las a couple time we dint have a good experience but tonight we are so glad that we got Alejandro he is over attentive and his guacamole is just on point  this is real Mexican food !!! Im Mexican and i love  the touch of the Zapata's vibes"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. I have liked everything I gave had here."}
{"text":"Called this evening to place an order for pick up  for my family.  When the lady answered she didn't even ask if she could help she proceeded to say, \"we aren't taking any orders for 2 hours because our kitchen is so busy. Mind you it's 747pm and they close at 9pm. Unbelievable. Not going again."}
{"text":"I have always driven past this place, and wanted to give it a try. Last night I was finally able to try this place, and I can't say enough good things about this place!  The decorations and atmosphere of the restaurant seems very authentic. As we walked in, we were greeted by two beautiful smiles. We were seated within 10 minutes. It was quite crowded for a Sunday night.   I ordered the shrimp enchiladas and sangria. My husband had the beef tongue tacos. They give you as much chips and dips as you want, and our order also came with a delicious tomato noodle soup.   All of the food was delicious: Zapata's food is one of the best Mexican foods I have had. Whenever I get the munchies for Mexican food, I know where to come from now on.  Excellent service, and great food and drinks. Definitely would like to come back for my birthday celebration dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for a while now. It's always great however went there the other night early dinner and it was absolutely outstanding in the north area of Vegas I would certainly recommend and this place to eat and drink for that matter they have great margaritas my partner had a chimichanga enchilada Style and I had three cheese enchiladas and it was outstanding"}
{"text":"We were just looking for some good food on the way out of Vegas and luckily we tried this place.  Easy to get to off the freeway. Get the guacamole!!! All our meals were delicious and large portions. We were so full after filling up on chips, salsa and bean dip. FYI-The taco shells are deep fried, I would have  liked them to not be fried, but still good.  Friendly service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Went to this location with my family last night. Place was clean and comfortable. Food was EXCELLENT and the service and staff were impeccable! Great place we will definitely be back. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Really good margaritas although light on the tequila, live music, and good food. The decor and atmosphere are also spot on. We sat at the bar and both bartenders were very nice. The tres de leche cheesecake was delicious."}
{"text":"They have some of the best guacamole in town!  This is an intimate little place, only about 20 tables or so plus a bar area.  The hostess stand is very disorganized and waiting space is limited, however the bar is a great place to kill time.  Bartender is awesome, super friendly, and she even brought out some chips and salsa for us to snack on while we had a beer and waited for our table.  Somehow the hostess got confused and forgot we were waiting at the bar and marked us off the list, but we got it all resolved.    The food, oh my goodness, the food is muy delicioso!  It took a little while to come out, but it was well worth the wait.  I had the sizzling fajitas de camarones with their yumazing handmade flour tortillas and he had the pollo estilo reforma agraria, which is a vinegar marinaded chicken dish.  We also loved that they have a lot of huevos dishes not limited to breakfast hours.  And like other yelpers have noted, the parking lot is tiny.  Knowing this ahead of time helped me mentally prepare to be patient and creative with my parking options."}
{"text":"I've never reviewed this place despite eating here several times. Prior to today, I could only descibe Viva Zapatas as a 5/5. Today, I'd be hard pressed to to give it a one. The three stars is only for the glorious days of old.  Service was extremely slow whereas normally its lighting fast. It was pretty clear the waiter forgot to put in our order. The chips were burned and we received few drink refills. They were busy (as they always are), but I'm used to tthe service being attentive and speedy. Not today. We were considering leaving when...  FINALLY! Here comes the food! The beans were inedibley salty, and no ones food - even those we have enjoyed many times before - was any good. Cold, bland, oversalted...  The worst of all was the Tacos de camarones (shrimp tacos). I'd never tried them and I was excited to give them a shot.   Supposedly these are \"moms recipe\", but I really doubt she chopped shrimp into tiny peices and deep fried until it was no longer recognizable as shrimp (it could have been chicken, hell I dont know). What only can be described as fried matter was overflowing from my tortillas and my only hope was a large cup of sauce they brought with the meal. Nope... a room temp thick, heavily mayo based sauce flavored with chipotle seasoning. C'mon guys.   My wife had the carne asada con rajas y crema which is usually out of this world. Today it suffed the same bland, oversalted fate. A light but robust sauce was replaced with an overly rich and salty goo that covered what would otherwise be decent carne asada.   Our two other guests (also long time diners here) were similarly disappointed.  Every place has a bad day now and again, but I really hope its not a sign of things to come."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was EXCELLENT! They were super busy tonight. We spent about 30 minutes at the bar before we were seated. The service was consistently amazing. Bartenders, servers, bussers and management : ) AMAZING SERVICE"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! I had the carne asada burrito a la carte smothered in red sauce and I really enjoyed it. It wasn't the best I've ever had but definitely one of the better alternatives here in Las Vegas. Rarely do I make it this far north but I would definitely go again if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch at Zapatas and a great waiter Jesus was terrific... Margaritas were wonderful I have the Carnitas and they were some of the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Wow. I have been here many times and can't i've never reviewed them. This is not your typical Mexican restaurant. The small innocuous restaurant serves up some incredible food with friendly fast and efficient service.  It seems like everything is made in house including the corn and flour tortillas. To start with you going to get chips with refried beans and a nice medium - hot salsa. The challenge is they are so good not to fill up on them prior to your meal arriving.  The meals come with a bowl of soup which consists of a nice consommé with micro noodles. Very flavorful and enjoyable. While they have the typical Mexican dishes on the menu, there are many things that I'm sure you've never tried before but need exploration. We had the fish  fillet stuffed with octopus and shrimp which was incredible. We also had the pork chili Verde pork was quite tender and flavorful and nice fresh chili verde sauce. The flavor quite complex and very enjoyable.  The servers are friendly, knowledgeable, and seem to really enjoy being there. They had live music consisting of a guitar player who also saying and it helped create a great atmosphere.  Don't be concerned about the number of stars on yelp as the reviews for real. This place is really that good."}
{"text":"Not a bad mexican restaurant... hard to find an amazing one but they have great homemade tortillas and amazing drink specials at happy hour. Their green sauce is delicious. I didn't care for the cheese enchiladas and I LOVE cheese. Kind of seemed to be cheap cheese because it was very chewy. But all in all it is a good place, just not the best we have been to."}
{"text":"Expansive menu, food with a depth of flavors, and live mariachi music. This is my go to restaurant for Mexican food and features a surprisingly delicious steak menu. You can watch the tortillas being handmade. It's out of the way for most Las Vegans, but worth it."}
{"text":"Service is always on point the food is great!!! The atmosphere is accented by the Mariachi band or live music!!! I have been coming here for years & I will continue!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with often live music. Quite out of the way, but a must experience if in North Las Vegas. Nice bar and traditional well prepared and generous dishes. I often try the Carnitas at a new place and these were top notch. Cannot go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"Whenever it starts off great and starts slipping and slipping and soon you feel neglected, you can't help but to feel bum and disappointed especially when you genuinely liked your server.  We were immediately greeted and seated. The hostess was very welcoming and friendly.Good vibes. Annnnd...that's about it. Great personality when our server did appear, but even that was scarce. Food was just your average fare you would get in similar settings.  As we were nearing the end of our meal, it was really picking up in there. We left not disappointed nor did we drive off feeling thrilled. Couldve been an off night, but I am willing to try again. Just wouldn't go out my way just yet.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good! You'll pay a little more for it, but it is a nice place with a nice atmosphere and very friendly staff.  We really enjoyed the creamy bean dip they seved along with the chips and salsa. We ordered the large guacamole which was super fresh and prepared tableside by our waiter. The entrees come with a cup of fideo soup which I had never had before, but was so delicious and left me wanting more.  All of our entrees were cooked to perfection and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent EXCELLENT food here..  The service is outstanding and I highly recommend people to come here for an amazing dinner.. The menu is indeed pricier than most places but when you try their food, it's very much worth it.. And the whole inside of this place is clean..  I'd give it 10 stars if that was possible"}
{"text":"We  have been here many times before always have had great food how ever tonight was not good the food did not taste as good as it has in the past I had fajitas the plate was hot but my food was only warm by time I got to the second tortilla it was cold and hard. I  have not given up on this restaurant yet I will try again. Maybe an off night?"}
{"text":"Unreal!    Who would have thought that North of Las Vegas you could find a Mexican paradise. The food here was so good...I blew right through my New Years diet and will likely come back again tomorrow for the same.   The service is impeccable and the staff are on it. Whether the live music is every night, or I just got lucky...it was perfect.   Try the carnitas!  But beware the bean dip and salsa will have you almost full before the meal arrives.   Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place about 6 months ago,  and this has become the only place we go for Mexican food.   In a  time of  franchise dominance, this place gives a genuine local flavor.  I've had various stuff  there, and not a bad meal yet.  Tacos, fajitas,  enchiladas,  and even the Steak Ala Mexicana.. you can't go wrong  with any."}
{"text":"Great little place with authentic food and a very large tequila selection. I have been there twice and will definitely be there again"}
{"text":"I've got to say that this is a top Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  I drive by there once in awhile and it is always packed, so I stopped by for some lunch one day.  The place is nice inside.  It has a large bar and different dining separated areas so it  has some private and quaint booths and tables.  The service was excellent.  The waiters were fast but not in a hurry.    The food.  It was eleven in the morning so I felt like breakfast.  I had some eggs with shredded beef and my friend had the flautas.  It was all good.  I don't think it is authentic Mexican food, but it is quality Mexican food as the masses know it.    I do want to go back at dinner time and try some more items on their menu to get a better idea for how good the food is."}
{"text":"This place is a must visit when in Vegas.  Get away from the Strip, get away from the buffet table and have some really really good food.  Mexican home cooking I have to say.  This is the way my grandmother would have cooked...if she wasn't Norwegian and from MN.  Service was great after a short wait for a table.  We sat by the tortilla station, pressed fresh and tossed on the flat top.  A fresh tortilla is the only way to really enjoy Mexican food.  The food came out quick, very authentic and very nice spice.  I had a pork dish with flour tortillas and they were so soft and fluffy I could have eaten them all day.  The pork was wonderful, perfectly cooked with a nice heat but not overpowering.  Bean were good as was the rice yet I left them alone do to the tortillas, didnt want to crowd them from the meal.  Well worth the visit and the wait and I will be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice and really enjoyed it both times, this time our server wasn't as attentive as we would have liked but it still wasn't bad.  All the food was great with the exception of the Monetary Jack queso 'dip'...there is NO dipping about this at all it was a pile of grease with some melted cheese in the middle.  I have had queso at many mexican restaurants and I love it this is something I would never eat again:("}
{"text":"I was really surprised at the quality and authenticity of the food!  I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp and was extremely pleased.  Oh man, I want some right now!  The menudo was also good."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday day morning. I was ecstatic to find that they open early and you can get lunch.  When we entered in we were we were greeted by the friendly staff and we were seated immediately. Again it was early so they weren't to busy.   Our waiter Jorge was awesome and very attentive. He kept our cups full and was had patience with our five year old.  We learned he had a young daughter and he certainly is great with kids.  They offer a soup for the table which is flavorful and delicious.  Our food arrived and both dishes we orders were really good.  No complaints  The establishment isn't in the greatest area, and there is a bus stop right outside and someone was digging through the garbage while we parked.    I think it's a must try if your looking for good Mexican food in a comfortable sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Mehhhhhhh....  I never start a review like that but that's how I felt...   Me being Mexican American I don't like eating at Mexican restaurants cause I can make that food my self. But there is those times where you are like screw it and being new to north Vegas it was a good excuse... well it was settled today..   I had a craving for Fideo soup.. I ordered a bowl to share with my girl, obviously not the only thing I wanted to eat.. but when I received it, it was warm and not hot kinda ruined it but I didn't want to complain...  For my main course I ordered a wet Asada burrito.. I'm sorry but that thing was BLAND.. nothing stood out in that hot mess everything kind of just blended and got lost together...salt works wonder when you know how to use it right..   The only thing I will not complain about is the hospitality in the establishment. Our hostess was nice and our server was on point with service.  Sorry guys but I won't be back.   The horchata was good though!"}
{"text":"Solid!  The Chile Relleno Camarón is a wonderful taste adventure that you must take your mouth on. You'll be a better person after eating it.  The soup. I'd come just for the soup. The house tomato soup was the best thing I ate on our vacation. The Habanero Salsa is just hot enough to have a little kick but just mild enough where I was happily eating as much of it as I could before our meal came. When our meal did arrive it came with  fresh, homemade, tortillas!   The food easily deserves five stars and the service is superlative. Our drinks and chips were always full. Did I mention the soup?  When we arrived around 3:30 on a Monday afternoon every seat was taken and there was at least three parties in front of us. There is tiny place for about four to five people to stand in the door but after that you can wait outside in the shade. This San Francisco kid can't handle 108 in the parking lot. I don't mind waiting for an excellent meal, and it was worth the wait  but I need some place to wait that has A/C. I'd still come back in 100+ degree heat and stand outside in the shade for an hour, it is that great! I'd love more than anything to give this a five star review because I'll never forget how amazing it was but there were tiny little things that need minor improvement.   When I'm within 100 miles of this gem there is a 99.98% chance I will be back."}
{"text":"Always great service and great food when I visit here. Thankfully some friends invited me out, it's something that I would have missed otherwise."}
{"text":"Now this was legit Mexican food. And what a dining experience. Felt like a luxury restaurant and the food and menu was amazing. Servers are dressed up in white dress shirts and they wheel out the sizzling food.  I had a chicken lunch dish and don't regret it for a second. Have to come back here to explore the menu more. Great place to take someone for a date too I think. Five stars!  Yum Yum :-)"}
{"text":"Worth the drive to this outstanding authentic Mexican food.  Gr8 margaritas, shrimp chile rellanos, cerviche, moles, pork, tongue and menudo.  Fabulous ambience and gracious service.  Entertainment usually and big booths for a relaxing big meal."}
{"text":"In town for work and found this gem on Yelp. Great atmosphere, cool AC, and delicious Mexican food.  I'm from Southern California which is known for Mexican, and I have to say, this was the best Mexican food I've had in a long time.  Been dip and salsa w chips to start, fideo soup with every meal, and I had a chicken enchilada (lots of white meat chicken), a hard shell shredded taco, and chile relleno.   Really good and I highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Zapatas has great food. Awesome apps and drink menu too. But what really sets them apart for me is the service. Beyond friendly! Favorite Mexican restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Best mexican restaurant ive been to in a long time. The service is always attentive & friendly. They always have a live musician and the atmosphere is kinda old style. The food, while a little on the pricey side is delicious. I always get the shrimp in garlic sauce. Freshly made tortillas. And the bottomless chips, beans and salsa are the best in town. The parking can be tough but its well worth it. Great place"}
{"text":"Great local place. The food and service excellent.A true hidden gem if your visiting LV I ordered rib eye steak with enchilada. Delish . Stop in and you won't be disappointed. BTW a full bar ,"}
{"text":"There are a couple of things that make you realize you are at a LEGIT mexican place.  Menu has lots of things that you have no idea what it means There is a random guy that plays a guitar in the corner And the most important : there is a chubby nice mexican lady making tortillas ..fresh ones   This restaurant was amazing. Service was impecable. Drinks , salsa and chips NEVER went below half before getting refilled.Impressive!  I am not giving 5 stars because of its location. Why so far?? and why behind a truck stop??   What would i recommend? The coca cola steak, carne asada and the refried beans. Epic win plates!  We were a group of 12 and the food came outstanding, service was impressive, ambiance was legit and overall experience was great. Check it out !!"}
{"text":"Carnitas are not carnitas. The coca cola ones were ribs in a sweet sauce like bbq and the regular ones were ribs with salty sauce. Beans were great so were the homemade flour tortillas. They need to learn to make carnitas estilo michuacan"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service. Everyone is so attentive and polite. The food was DELICIOUS. Chili relleno was great, the green chile pork was sooo tender. I highly recommend this place! We stopped here based on the location and the Yelp reviews, so glad we did!"}
{"text":"Since moving from Las Vegas I miss you the most! I left Las Vegas in 2011 and still miss this restaurant terribly! The food is the best! I have not found a restaurant that comes close here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was there a while ago so I don't remember too much.  All I remember is that the atmosphere was amazing, I remember that the staff were equally amazing, and I remember that the food suggested by the staff was phenomenal.  Great authentic Mexican food, great bartenders/servers, and an awesome time.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I went with my family to enjoy good Mexican food. Well we dreamt of having good food. The food was terrible. I order Birria de Chivo and it was gross it tasted sour and the smell was rotten, the rice was hard and cold and it tasted 2 days old i did not eat at all. My hubby order the chile colorado and as soon as they asked how do u want your meat cooked i knew it was not going to be good. It sucked. Comida aqui no Sirve para nada. I do not recomend this place."}
{"text":"Food was good but took way too long to serve the food. lunch took 2 hours and 15mins. The food was good, but they did mess up one of the four meals and we weren't about to wait another half hour for it to be made correctly. Staff was friendly...just...so...slow... It even took about 10-15 mins to get the credit card back. Great food, but by the time food got served, we were all half way full from the four bags worth of chips we munched on during our wait."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed and must have driven past here hundreds of times.  I love their chimichanga and beef lunch burrito. Jorge is our server most of the time. Everyone is very friendly and professional.  Food usually takes 15 minutes or so to come out."}
{"text":"Yelper's.........   Great spot right off the freeway. Large menu and chips to die for. They even make fresh tortillas on the spot. I had the most delicious soft shredded beef ever there. Also got the table side guacamole which was mixed perfectly (to your liking).   This will be my default restaurant while traveling the 15 fwy.  Large place, clean and plenty of parking. Huge tequila bar too. Oh and outstanding service, water and iced tea filled without asking."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food and service is amazing. I live down the street and never even noticed this spot because it's a bit small on the outside and not too noticeable but when me and my boyfriend discovered this place we just loved it and keep coming back. Every time I come the service is incredible and I always order something different; I have yet to be disappointed. Favorite Mexican spot for dinner, most definitely."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food and atmosphere anywhere in Vegas. Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"This was an excellent new find for me!  A complimentary cup of Fideo Soup was a nice prelude to a veritable Mexican feast after downing also complimentary warm homemade Tortilla Chips in a mellow Bean Dip and spicy hot Red Salsa.  A made to order Guacamole Dip prepared tableside by our wiatress was excellent with a freshly opened avocado and just the right amount of lime, cilantro, and other seasoning.  White Onions, Jalapeno Peppers, and pieces of tomato enhanced this yummy dish.  Next up for me was a 17 Tecala Combination Plate, consisting of a suitably soft Chile Relleno and a fine Green Chile Pork & Bean Burrito, along with a Shredded Beef Taco prepared with a requested crunchy hard shell that was ordered ala carte.  The beef was a little soggy; otherwise everything was tasty.  To help fill the gut were included Refritos and Mexican Rice.  Diane enjoyed a large Shrimp Quesadilla executed with a Flour Tortilla, melted Cheddar Cheese, and cut up pieces of shrimp.  Our meal was accompanied by fine guitar music and singing.  Service was friendly, quick, and excellent all around.  Water glasses were repeatedly refilled without request.  4-1/2 stars overall!  I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Let me keep this simple.....delicious authentic Mexican food! The guacamole is so freaking good! Just go eat and enjoy! You're welcome."}
{"text":"Horrible service ...... A f%$#  up attitude by the bartender .. #1 warm beer to much head Well sir all beers are form the same keg..... Really...... Then i Choose the other one.. Ok it was cold .... but... Dirty glass... Respond . # 2 Ohhh those are just flakes form the micheladas... Realy ...  No that is a dirty glass .@!!! To bad never ill imagined that will happend there i always got a good service Even on a hot summer day after been on the pick a part yard for a few hours . The was two girls at the bar all this done by the one with kinda blondy hair ... NOT THE BRUNETTE SHE WAS NICE."}
{"text":"This is good mexican food in Vegas!  I love the chips, salsa and bean dip.  The enchiladas and tacos were very flavorful and the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested we come here because the photos on their website looked so good. I have been here before and did not like the Michoacán style carnitas, but since she is my guest... we came. I have to say. I really really liked my food this time! We had the number 7 lunch special and it was excelente!!! I will now come back again. Thank you Brian for the super great service!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. I had 2 things, the carnitas which were not that great but OK, and a taco that had fried shrimp, cabbage, pico and a mayo/sour cream sauce on top that was amazing, delicious! the pico was so tasty. Their salsa was different it had kind of a black pepper taste to it."}
{"text":"Great lunch and dinner!  I love the ambiance!  Very friendly staff.  Every time I have been here the food tastes great!  Free chips with beans and salsa while you wait."}
{"text":"We read the mixed reviews and decided to try Zapatas and were glad we did. Hubby and I both had shrimp tacos. The shrimp was large and each taco contained 4 shrimp each. The salsa is very different from what we are used to but, we really enjoyed it. The side of refried beans to eat with your chips was a nice touch as was the soup. Service was excellent and the food was excellent. Prices were higher than most Mexican restaurants but the quality made up for it. We felt we got what we paid for."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 9 years and it's truly one of a kind. If anyone says it's horrible cause the wait for their food that's a good thing cause this place is packed and it's definitely worth the wait. Everything here is made with love. I drive 23 miles across town to come here and I will do it happily every time."}
{"text":"A good portion of my last trip to Vegas was spent looking for a taqueria. Where was all of the Mexican food?! This time around I remembered to use Yelp and found this place.  Why three stars? I found the food to be disappointing and lacking. While the rice and beans exceeded my expectations it was the main entrees that didn't cut it for us.   Parking can be tough if you are coming in the evening during the weekend. Drinks are great and guac is made right in front of you from fresh ingredients like the tradiational Mexican restaurants typically do.  Decor is adorable and service was fine.  My quest for awesome Mexican food in Vegas continues!"}
{"text":"The service at this place is impeccable! The food and drinks are on point as well. Everything is very fresh. You can tell. They made our guacamole at the table. I ordered the Pollo al Cognac. It was very good and unlike anything I had ever tasted before. Glad we ended up here."}
{"text":"Never disappoints!  The fresh guacamole was on par.  The service was great.  My dad forgot to specify green sauce for his enchiladas and they remade his order without hesitation.  My chile relleno and chicken enchilada were just what I was craving.  The bean dip could've used some salt as it was bland.  My favorite Mexican food spot.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I end up eating here at least 3 or 4 times a month...if not for lunch then for dinner. This is authentic Mexican (made by real Mexicans - I'm just sayin). They have homemade tortillas which are delicious!! They always bring out fresh chips with salsa and bean dip and I suggest getting the guacamole as an appetizer. They make it tableside and you can choose how hot you want it (amount of jalapenos) as you can choose the amount of onions, tomatoes, and cilantro.  For lunch they have your typical \"Order by Number\" chart. I generally order the numero siete (that would be 7). It's a cheese enchilada and beef taco, although I usually sub the taco for a bean tostada. For dinner I usually get the shrimp ceviche which is BOMB!! The shrimp is cooked with the citrus juice and there are tomatoes, jalapenos, and onions, served with a fried corn tortilla (essentially a shrimp tostada I suppose).  It is quite tasty - especially if you top it with that guacamole.  They also serve traditional Mexican fare like menudo (beef stomach anyone?) and nopales (cactus).  HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I promise you will go again."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites to eat at. My hubby and I came across this restaurant about 5 years ago and we still love it. The food is always delicious and the service is great. If you are looking for a relaxing and intimate atmosphere, this is your place especially if you try their patron margarita! Bum.Com"}
{"text":"We love this place and always come for Enchiladas, the services is excellent and prices are just right. Live music and polite servers make this place our favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I love YELP for helping me find spots like this. I probably would have just drove by if I hadn't had read the reviews. I am not a local, but we visit Nellis AFB once a year and ALWAYS stop for a meal here.   Ordered a Cadillac margarita and Fajitas. Homemade flour tortillas with steak, chicken and shrimp? Sold! I love that they serve bean dip with the chips. Bar area is nice, but service was a little slow.   Overall the restaurant is pretty small, so it can be busy. Parking can also be an issue. We will continue to visit when in the area. Appreciate the Military Discount. Love when businesses recognize our men & women who serve."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and ordered a carne asada torta.  For some reason they actually serve it with fries...I'm still trying to figure that one out.  As for the torta, it wasn't bad but the meat tasted more stewed than grilled.  One thing that's not good at all is the parking...forewarned is forearmed.    Overall, serviceable Mexican food but nothing special."}
{"text":"What is the one thing everyone looks forward to when going to a Mexican-style restaurant?  Chips & Salsa!  And, of course, drinks!  Bottomless chips and salsa is the first thing served to you after you are seated.  The staff is efficient and nice, and are always happy to give you more chips & salsa!  A lot of places have become cheap with their chips, bread, whatever it may be that is usually free.  But not Viva Zapata's.    The Chile Relenos are excellent.  Definitely my go to place for Mexican food.    I dare you to eat your entire plate of food too.  It's enough food for today and tomorrow.  The location is awkward, as it's right across a gas station; but definitely worth, at the very least, checking out."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to visit my Dad in Utah, and was pleasantly surprised by how good this place was. The chips were fresh, and the salsa was on the spicy side. I got the lunch special chili colorado with fresh-made corn tortillas, and it was really tasty, as well as reasonably priced. Since this is way out in the boonies, I doubt the typical Vegas weekend warrior would ever find their way into this place (although who knows, it is Vegas after all), I'd recommend it if you happen to be passing through on I-15 and want something better than your typical Chevy's/Mexican chain."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! This was our first visit and Jose R. was our server. He gave very attentive service along with the manager (didn't catch his name)."}
{"text":"I've given this place three shots at different times.... they do a lot of business but the service and kitchen cannot keep up.  If you thinking of during work lunch... think twice.  30 minute wait to place and order and then another 20 to get your food...  might as well to get it to go..."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and they definitely give you your money's worth. They had live music, great service, and my cup never went empty. I am a server and the staff gets \"outstanding service\" award in my book without a doubt!"}
{"text":"We moved here a month ago and stumbled on this place. Since then it has become our #1 Mexican restaurant in Vegas and we have been there TWICE. The food is delicious and the chips not only come with salsa but also refried bean dip. The customer service is excellent; they will continuously check up on you and ensure all is well (to include drinks being topped off). It's a bit smaller so usually you'll have to wait a few minutes for a table/booth but I have never had to wait as long as they predict. The parking lot is a bit small too but both times we've simply parked next door and walked over. There has been live music both times but it has been acoustic etc so it isn't overwhelming. We went on Cinco de Mayo and it was great too. There were even Corona girls there passing out little Corona shawls for your beer bottles, and there were drink specials too. Love this place."}
{"text":"THIS WAS AN AWESOME FIND! Took a road trip with my Dad, and he guided me to this place, awesome. Very few places can pull off the authentic ambiance and Mexican flavor. I dare say it gets close ( I said close not there) to my Mom's cooking.  Went here for brunch on a Sunday, mellow.  They bring out chips and a good salsa, next when you order they bring you SOPA!/soup as an appetizer, included. Huevos con chorizo, are great. Next time I'm in Vegas, will make the trip over to this place on my break from rolling the dice.  Worth the trek or cab ride if your looking for a hangover cure."}
