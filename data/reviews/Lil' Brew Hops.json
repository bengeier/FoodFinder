{"text":"Came to try this restaurant because of the recommendation from colleagues. 
It was on a Tues and oysters were selling at $1 each if you ordered a cocktail. 
We ordered 12 oysters, grilled pork belly, duck liver pate, scallop ceviche and chicken lollipops. 
Oysters were okay, nothing too special about it. 
For all other dishes, individual components were okay. And pork belly was done very nicely. However, there was one common problem: the sauces did not match the food. For pork belly, and chicken lollipops, the sauces were both too sweet that they did not serve the purpose of balancing the heaviness of the dishes. 
For the scallop ceviche, there was too many different strong flavours that the sweetness of scallop was covered up. 

On the other hand, the cocktail (just-in-Thyme)  was done quite beautifully. 

Overall, I have better tapas elsewhere and I am not too sure if I will come back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch last week. We both ordered a draft beer, which on the menu said, all drafts were 20oz, but we were brought 12oz, without being asked. I ordered the avocado sandwich with fries. The sandwich toppings were good (peaches, egg, brioche bread, arugula, avocado), but there was literally no seasoning on anything. Probably the most bland open faced sandwich I have ever ordered. I got the fries with my sandwich, which were fine, except when I asked for vinegar, I was brought a small bowl filled with vinegar. It was weird pouring vinegar onto my fries from a bowl. My husband had the burger, which was pretty standard. Nice atmosphere, classy place, but too pricey for the quality for me to return."}
{"text":"We've always loved Hungry Brew Hops next door, so we were excited about this new spot opening and we were not disappointed! Just like at HBH, the staff are extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what they serve - with a great attitude to match. I started with a Manhattan and was delighted with the bourbon they used to make it. 
The four of us at the table had already eaten dinner earlier at home, but we couldn't resist sharing some of the menu items including: sea bream ceviche, chicken liver pâté, ricotta-stuffed gnocchi, pork belly, clams, and potato bread. Each dish was an experience. It is obvious that a lot of care and preparation goes into everything, so don't expect pub food. Expect everything to be high quality and carefully thought out from the food to the wine and liquors."}
{"text":"If you want to have a quality night out with amazing cocktails and lots of delicious sharing plates as well as a dt Toronto atmosphere look no further. I love coming here for brunch as well as Sundays. The mimosas and Eggs Benedict are on point! I bring all my friends here and we're never disappointed. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were walking along Main Street Newmarket and discovered this restaurant.  It looked like it's going to be great just by looking at it.  Sometimes you can judge restaurant by just looking at the place.  We usually judge by looking at how many people are in the place.

We were disappointed, we were disappointed by the fact that without reservation we could only sit at the \"Oyster Bar\" table in the little corner.  We got to watch this guy prying open oysters all night long.

First of all, lots of local beer selection.  I love products from Great Lake Brewery, so if you're up for an IPA, you're in good hands.  

The food is good but it's not something that I would give 5 start rating on.  The steak was cook to perfection but it felt a little mushy.  We did order the fresh oyster and ya they're fresh.  The guy opens and smells every oyster to make sure it's fresh.  The squid dish was really good, very tender and the sauce was really good, I had the dish pretty clean since the sauce was so good.

Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"I had great hopes for this place. I follow them on Instagram, they have a vinyl night, jazz night, always highlighting cool, creative drinks.  So when friends wanted to go I was so excited to recommend Lil Brew Hops. 

We were quickly greeted and seated. Our server got us settled explained the menus. 

I order one of the special cocktails that I had seen on Instagram. Hazelnut infused mescal, jagermeister, agava, ginger , basil and lime topped with a hot chilli pepper. I know, sounds crazy, but was oh so good. Could drink these all night but at $14 held back to only one. 

For dinner order a bunch of sharing plates , sour dough bread, chicken wings stuffed with sausage, steamed mussels served in a hollowed out pumpernickel loaf and gnocchi stuffed with lamb mozzarella and olives. Food was very inventive but somehow missed the mark.  Maybe they are trying too hard to be \"different\".

With dinner I ordered a glass of cab. The wine was ok until I got to the bottom and got a mouth full of sediment. 

When the server came, i mention the wine and she said \"would you like another glass\". Given  I was done with dinner I asked for a bourbon instead. 

Ling story short, when the bill came they had charged me for both the wine and bourbon. I asked why i was charged for wine. She said i would have to speak to manager. Manager refused to credit bill because i had \"drank\" the wine before mentioning the sediment at the bottom of the glass!!

Imagine, $250 bill and wouldn't credit $10.50 glass of crappy wine.  Need I say more??

Based on this and the mediocre food, I give them 1 star."}
{"text":"As a regular to their big sister, Hungry Brew Hops, I wasn't surprised by the quality of service, and food and drinks they had at Main Street's newest hot spot. If your friends dig mixed drinks and share plates in a cool, environment that includes a turntable to play your vinyl, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and a meal with friends! Patio is small but great on a summer day or night. Mixologist Michael serves up some tasty cocktails! 
Nice to see Newmarket hosting such nice restaurants!  Main st is slowly becoming the place to be!"}
{"text":"I love the food and service.  The chef is great.  The brunch is amazing.  The bar tenders can prepare an amazing old fashion.  They have a great bourbon selection."}
{"text":"So f***ing good! Drinks are amazing, the bar manager is SO talented. Wait staff are always so friendly and knowledgable. Food is always delicious!!! I find this place has an upscale and classy atmosphere, but without the snoody staff to go with it  :)"}
{"text":"This is the only time I have posted to here but I just had to express my thoughts on this place


The best restaurant I have been to ever!!

Food was out of this world and very inexpensive!

3 people 4 dishes 3 cocktails.    100 dollars"}
{"text":"The portions are too small for the price. The ambiance did not justify the high price; however, the food was tasty and the service was good.

If you want an unusual tasty combination of flavours at a high price and an atmosphere of a common bar this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I've never in my life had a better brunch then this place give me one Saturday morning just before noon. The eggs benny was absolutely perfectly cooked, the house made sausage rounds were incredible, the little seasonal salad that came with it was so fresh. I don't even like berrys.... in that salad, amazing! The pour over coffee just made my time at this place just so enjoyable and peaceful. Service is the best, this place is awesome..... you have to go."}
{"text":"Went here a couple nights ago with a girlfriend to try it out. Everything was pretty good, friendly waiters, good atmosphere. Made a mistake and ordered the tuna poke. The tuna was came out and it was black. My friend and I were confused. We eat tuna poke all the time and know that raw tuna should look red. We thought maybe it was a dressing of some sort and took a bite anyway. The tuna was completely rotten. We returned it and the waiter let the chef try it too and even the chef confirmed that the tuna was way too oxidated. Seriously a concern if the chef is serving raw tuna and don't know how raw tuna looks (we took a pic to prove). Anyway, my friend got sick the next day. 

Don't get the tuna poke. Everything else tasted alright."}
{"text":"A lovely environment with top tier cocktail and a menu that relies heavily on animal proteins that begs for diversity. The Shishito Peppers--with sea salt and charred lemon--were a table favorite of the veggies and omnivores alike!"}
{"text":"We popped in on Good Friday, between lunch and dinner service, so the menu was limited, but everything we had was great. The oysters were the only thing that were a little lacking - but maybe it was just the particular type they had in that day. Their cheese and meat board was more than enough for the price and it was presented beautifully. The parsnip fries looked really good but our order never arrived. The drinks were done right as well. Look forward to going back !"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some seafood and fish and we got exactly what we wanted. Delicious oysters, scallop ceviche and the trout. Amazing. Service was great and he ambience is perfect."}
{"text":"The food was good, but I'd rather go next door for food.... the drinks though... completely different level.  Yes they aren't your jack Astor prices for drinks but these are custom cocktails that are reminiscent of our adventures in Toronto.  We've been to tts and bar chef, and their drinks are a very good representation of that type of cocktail.  

Could we go every night to drink? Probably not.  But any special occasion we're there!

Love it. It gets busy btw so go early or prepare to wait in line"}
{"text":"We have tried to visit Lil' Brew Hops multiple times and they always closed. They have different hours for winter and summer and whatever. So make sure to check their latest opening hours on Facebook or just call to confirm!

Drop by on a sunny early autumn afternoon and finally got to try this place out! It was the last week they opened for lunch. We arrived at the in between time with limited menu offerings. Ended up just ordering cocktails and some shucked oysters!

Darkhorse of Main Street ($13) darkhorse rye, madeira, campari, lime juice, ginger jalapeño simple syrup, pear bitters
Green with Envy ($13) pisco, simple syrup, kiwi purée, lime juice

Cocktails were delicious! Since there are not too many good cocktail bars in the area, worth coming if you want some well crafted drinks!

Oysters was tasty but at $3+ per oysters! I suggest come on Tuesdays for their Shuck-a-Buck with an order of cocktail!

Will be back to try out other cooked food Lil' Brew Hops offers. And of course, will be ordering some cocktails again!"}
{"text":"My husband And I noticed Lil' Brew Hops which intrigued us by advertising shared played and mixology drinks. When we arrived it we were greeted by our pleasant server. We took our time reviewing the menu and was knowledgeably advised by our server on our food choices.  We tried several items on the menu all of which we both enjoyed! The atmosphere was quiet and intimate. Perfect for an evening out without children."}
{"text":"Sea bass Ceviche was pretty good and fresh. Very classy and elegant place for a date. Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at LBH, I've been to HBH (it's one of my favourite places on Main Street). Overall I had a great experience. 
When we walked in we were greeted immediately and asked where we would prefer to sit. We said we wanted to sit on the patio; there was one empty table, and the waitress said she would be right back, she was just going to wipe it down for us; not a problem! we were standing at the door for maybe a minute or two (we could see her going to the table to arrange it right away) ... within that time, the bartender, the manager and a few other staff members (including the guy bringing ice) came by to check on us, and be sure we are looked after. I have been to many other restaurants where you can stand at the food and no one bats an eye and you can stand there for at least 5 minutes for nothing! Right away i was very impressed. 
Once we were seated our waitress was excellent, very knowledgeable of the menu, the specials, and the drinks. We ordered a few appetizers, and drinks which were all excellent!! 
The only downside to everything is that the patio closes fairly early (mind you our waitress gave us ample warming and we were aware of the times) :( on a Friday night the patio closes at 11, and drinks have to be off the patio by 11:30. I am not sure if that's some type of by-law or just the restaurant."}
