{"text":"I went there on Friday night. The service was friendly and efficient, and the food came fast. The steak was great and cooked to our liking.  I haven't had a chance to try the desserts yet but will have to go back as they look really good, and id they are as good as the rest, it won't be disappointing!"}
{"text":"It's all about the bacon. (When isn't it?)   Back in the day, Quotes was our fallback when we needed a pint of Guinness and something and that something was always peameal bacon on a kaiser.   Fast-forward seven years'ish and I found myself tired of the current fallback, so I coerced my coworkers into lunch at Quotes. (I had them at \"Guinness\".)   Seven years later, it's still a damn good sammy though I changed things up a bit and hit it out of the park a pint of Sam Adams for a double sammy all the way. Strong recommend for their take on a Greek salad too. The coworkers had the Cajun chicken sandwich that was tasty, though loaded with about 4 tablespoons of Cajun mayo, so consider yourself in the know.   Service was great and the prices are what you'd expect for The Entertainment District: $7 for a pint and $10 for sandwich.   I think my old fallback might just be my new fallback."}

{"text":"I've been to Quotes a number of times as it's very close to a number of my friend's workplaces, it has a nice atmosphere and decent food.  I went here last week for lunch with a friend and while it was busy, it wasn't packed-elbow-to-elbow and the noise level was pretty good. I usually get the club sandwich (which always hits the spot) but this time i opted for the grilled cheese. Nothing really to write home about, but they do have pretty good fries and the grilled cheese was made with REAL cheese, not that processed crap.   Overall, its good pub fare, a small menu but good choices for a quick business-ish lunch. I've never been disappointed by the food here but never been blown away either. It's a good place for lunch, food comes quickly and if you're on a timed lunch, you should be able to get in and out of Quotes within an hour (or less). I'm sure there are some amazing restaurants in this area, but if you're looking for a good stop off before or after a show, with good food, reasonable prices and well paced service, this is a good bet."}
