{"text":"Absolutely terrible service.  We heard great things on yelp and other reviews but the exact opposite occurred.  Young female bartender with long dark brown hair wearing a baseball hat served us the wrong drink and expected us to pay for both and when we questioned her about it she was extremely rude.  Definitely DO NOT recommend.  Went across the street to Alley Cat Oyster Bar, great service, drinks and food and yesterday we went to Coastal taco which was also incredible so highly recommended both of them!!"}
{"text":"Fun stop on the river with three bocce courts, a few other games, ton of tvs, food and beer. The outdoor seating area is nice with wonderful view of the bridges. Great spot for after work happy hour or team building events. Can't wait to drop by during Flat out Friday during the nicer months."}
{"text":"Its an adult play ground! They have 3 bocce courts, beer pong, connect 4, jenga and more! If your ready to play games, drink and eat good pizza then this is the place for you. 

We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty quiet which was nice but also surprising because everyone knows Sunday is a funday! The outdoor fire pits and water view were a bonus and I imagine this place is going to boom in the summer! 

Bocce and beers!"}
