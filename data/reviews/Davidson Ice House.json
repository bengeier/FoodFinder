{"text":"It has been several months since I have felt so inspired to write a review! The last restaurant to utilize this location was a disappointment to say the least. I have only been in this area for four years, but my understanding is that very few restaurants have been able to be successful in this lesser visited part of Davidson. One would not think that only being a half mile up the road from downtown Davidson would make it that much harder, but it appears to be so. After my first experience at the Davidson Ice House, I think that trend might change!   The first thing that surprised me upon entering the restaurant is the fact that, rather than be seated at a table by a host, you simply approach the front counter and order there. I must say that this new trend is something I have come to favor. While in a higher scale establishment it is nice to be served, I often feel that I would much rather be in charge of my own dining experience by being personally charged with letting the staff know when I need something rather than to have someone constantly coming to check on me. The young man working behind the counter was very pleasant and thankfully very patient as I looked at all of my options. If you have not already looked at their menu, the Davidson Ice House specializes in making bowls. Think of Chipotle but with healthier options and where your food is made in a kitchen rather then made cafeteria style in front of you. That is not to say that the kitchen does not have a similar set up as chipotle does, but the food certainly tasted very fresh.   I must admit, it took me quite some time to figure out exactly how I wanted to make my first bowl. My fiancé was perhaps smarter than me and chose one of the pre-made bowls. For my bowl I chose mixed greens, cast iron chicken, marinated eggplant, spicy Pimento cheese, and creamy pesto sauce. It was fantastic! The marinated eggplant stole the show! I could have easily eaten an entire bowl of just eggplant! The pimento cheese was good, but I would not call it sassy. That does not mean it is not worth having, but if you are getting the Pimento cheese specifically for a unique flavor profile, you should skip it.   As to people giving bad reviews due to the lack of protein and overall food, I would like to point out that this place is marketed as a place for healthier eating options. One of the things that has caused Americans, myself included, to become so overweight is the huge portions. As one negative reviewer pointed out, you absolutely can go down the street for a large burger if that is what you are looking for. This is not the place for a fat greasy burger. This is not the place to eat so much food that you need a nap afterwards. This is a place you go when looking for a healthy option for eating out. If you want a big burger, go to Bad Daddys.   I think  one of the reasons this spot will become more and more popular is that it is quite easy to dine in house, but it is just as easy to take your meal to go. It is wonderful to have a healthier food option that can be, should you choose this route, \"fast food\".   As a final note, I would like to give the owner kudos. I respect that, rather than attempt to come up with some fancy name with some hidden meaning, the owner chose a name that utilizes and draws attention to the historic place in which she chosen to build her restaurant.  I would highly recommend checking this place out! I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times now. I always like to eat somewhere a few times before I leave a review.   This place is so vegan friendly which is great for our family.  We hardly eat out because all the vegan options everywhere are so mediocre, we just waste our money, and my home cooking is better.   But here, everything is so fresh, not over salted, so filling, and super tasty! My husband and I love their vegan chicken. They do charge extra for the vegan chicken, but we never feel like they skimp on the portion for the upcharge.  Bonus, it's HEALTHY!   Sidenote to the restaurant : sometimes the eggplant and sweet potatoes can be undercooked, but I've only gotten a few pieces like that."}
{"text":"Well, overall this was just an \"ok, so what\" experience and disappointing for it to be such given we were excited to see something new in the area and with a healthy food focus. We ordered the Buddha's Belly & Paleo A-Go-Go along with a side order of the Crispy Cauliflower. To break it down into the following (a) Value for food portion ... low to middle here. Both bowls were mostly brown rice with a really poor amount of the main protein (several, 5-6, really small pieces of chicken & less for the \"beefy\" meatballs) and the other parts. For the same price Whole Foods bowls at the deli in Huntersville serves much more. (b) Flavor ... mmeehh ... nothing especially memorable here. The crispy cauliflower was basically deep friend portions of cauliflower ... thought perhaps this would be something with a better twist on the veg. (c) Restaurant ... quite basic, but for the food served its sufficient. Perhaps it was due to relatively recent opening but some areas to improve on would be, make sure people receive the cup lids if you're going to keep behind the counter, a better (larger) station for the straws/napkins etc. instead of a small shelf on the side of the register area.   As mentioned above Whole Foods serves bowls in their deli which I would just stick to rather than trekking to this place for something that really is not that better."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, staff were kind & the food was delicious! Highly recommend the crispy cauliflower as a side. Crunch mushrooms were so good. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I actually think this place can be good but right now most of my bowl was filler. I would say 2/3 of the bowl was the rice at the bottom. Very small amount of the other stuff I chose. And the amount of protein was pathetically small. There is no reason to give so little chicken, it's not that expensive an ingredient. The flavors were pretty good but until they loosen the purse strings and give better portions of the stuff that counts I think they will struggle."}
{"text":"OK, folks here is a real unfiltered review.  1st: Kindred and Toast have nothing to worry about, they are 10's to this one.   So I go there and they offer wraps and bowls, but guess what, no wraps - only bowls available. really? Who opens a restaurant with not all the items on the advertised menu? these folks do. Thats like going to a pizza place and you cant get pizza - only pasta.. DUH..Dont soft open if you want to make a first impression for repeat customers.  The staff is slow & disorganized from the minute you walk in to serving after 28mins waiting on a cheap hard plywood painted bench seat. UGH.. I dont like the seating arrangements and you can tell smaller groups dont either. People were shying away from the concept of sharing a huge table with strangers.  Ok the food: overpriced, super small portions of the proteins and things of value (other than the loads of rice or greens ). Example: Maple glazed sweet potato's with NO glaze & there was literally 5 tiny pieces. Order pimento cheese and you get a teaspoon serving ..LOL.. no lie..  The cast iron chicken is tasty, but its very odd. I was told its made of all the meat (white & dark) but its cubed with other items so its clearly not all chicken. (fillers for sure & to me that is a misrepresentation of the meat & allows them to reduce the proteins with fillers and save money per-meal - ok I get it too - but dang its chicken.) Chicken portion looked like something I get if I was an inmate in a prison. I counted 6 cubes of meat, which had to weigh less than 2oz.  Finally, I left here ready to go over to fuel pizza for a slice as I left feeling like I ate a spring roll for lunch.. I rather stand up eating a monster burger at Toast.  If you like to eat like a bird, throw money out the window, sit with people you don't know, & leave hungry, this is the place for you. I wont pay a place to eat for a concept or history of a building or even the atmosphere. You need to offer more options, more portions- even just a tab bit would suffice because your price to portion control is not worth it.  I wish them all the best even though I gave a raw unfiltered truthful review. thanks"}
{"text":"To be honest, this whole experience was underwhelming. The concept is awesome I just wanted the food to be better. While there was a great variety to chose from in adding to my plate, there wasn't a lot of consistency in actual flavors. I feel as though they are trying to do everything at once without doing one thing really well."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely amazing! Tons of food combinations and toppings . Spicy green sauce and fried cauliflower were delicious! The whole family really enjoyed there lunch. The town is cute also around the restaurant. The owner was really nice . I highly recommend and you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"This week I went to the Davidson Ice House restaurant once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times we tried to order items and they were out. For lunch we tried to order brisket and they said they had meatballs instead and they were so so. Last night we ordered Cast Iron chicken and we got chicken meatballs and they were not good. I believe the restaurant is trying to save $$ by turning the cut of meat into meatballs and adding fillers. When we were there for lunch one of the folks at our table ordered Cast Iron chicken and it was actually pieces of chicken. Their portions are very small. They were also out of edamame..... not impressed and we had high hopes."}
{"text":"Kind of addicted to this place! There's nothing else like it in town. Though it's healthy, the food is creative and legitimately delicious. The Brule is my favorite. Portion sizes are generous -- i can rarely finish a whole bowl. Service is friendly and quick. And I also love that it's so eco-friendly."}
{"text":"Went in and ordered around 5 o'clock, wasn't too busy. Had to wait 20+ minutes for two bowls, to go. Was not given any to go silverware nor were the bowls marked which was which. That being said, the food was delicious. Highly recommend the meatballs as well as the brulé bowl. Spicy and flavorful, was really good and would get again. Can't wait for them to have faster service."}
{"text":"Three stars because they serve local craft beer.   Three stars because the place is just a very cool old building.  Three stars because you can sit outside and enjoy the great Davidson neighborhood.  Five star on taste, no doubt, the spin on healthy food is great.  Lots of great flavor and a very interesting menu, a la carte style ordering........  One star on value.   The minuscule amount of what they call protein is a shame.   The main dishes are about the size of a side salad.   I posted a pic of my dish - Cast Iron Chicken.   The Cast Iron Chicken is ground chicken, pressed together in the form of a meatball.  It had the taste of sausage, so I do not know if sausage is mixed in.  It was very good, but exactly three small pieces....  I added the Crunchy Mushrooms ($2 uncharged) and got four, yes 4 tiny shrooms.   They tasted great!!!!!   Added to the top, Shredded Cheddar, Caramelized Onion Wisps and Sassy Pimento Cheese ---- serving size, maybe one tablespoon of each.   To add insult to injury, the Asian BBQ Sauce is barely drizzled on top.    If you do not believe me, look at my pic.   I had to go back twice for extra sauce.   My wife had the Paleo Chicken Thighs, it was cut up in cubes, she made the same comment, the serving size was tiny.   She loved the grilled corn and raved about the silky ratatouille.  Again, tiny portions.   The Crispy Cauliflower is great, drizzled in spicy hot sauce!    It was a nice night and they were slammed, service was great, albeit slow.  They are definitely going thru the normal start up growing pains, no complaints, just a comment.    Yes, I am over critical of the portion size, I go out to eat about every night, I like to leave happy and satisfied, not hungry.    My wife and I probably could of ordered another bowl.   I have been around Davidson long enough to see many restaurants start off on fire, do super great for three to six months, before the pickyunis Davidson people gravitate back to the other spots that have been around for a few years, then they fold.  I would hate to see this happen and my suggestion, if anyone cares, is to add another bowl size, charge around $12.99, up from $8.99.  The larger bowl, with more protein would satisfy even the most hungry folks.   I wish them luck."}
{"text":"This was my second visit and I want desperately for this to be my go-to spot! The ingredients are amazingly prepared and accurately described on the menu. However there just isn't enough of them on each dish. Hopefully the portions will get larger, especially the protein. Hoping the third time is a charm!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious bowl with the tahini lemon sauce and the green hummus! I love all the delicious toppings and variety of what you can get.   And I finally found someone else who recognizes cheddar cheese as a vegetable! Some people understand."}
{"text":"Loved everything about Davidson Ice House! The \"bowl\" entree is unique and all the ingredients are healthy and fresh! There are so many yummy options it was hard to choose!"}
{"text":"I saw Davidson Ice House's soft opening advertised on Instagram and ducked in for lunch with my sister. The menu is fresh and FULL of flavor. What a welcome addition to the neighborhood! I had the Paleo A Go Go bowl over a bead of greens. It featured brisket, a silly ratatouille, pickled onions, and a spicy green sauce. I didn't find it too spicy, but I loved all of the flavors. The bowl size is good, but for me there wasn't enough protein. I would look to order extra meat next time.  My sister had the Roman Bowl which featured an amazing Caesar type dressing, cast iron chicken thighs, and the most rich and wonderful hummus. She also had it over a bed of greens. You can choose greens or grains.   Davidson Ice House has plenty of seating and even has a few local brews on tap. Looking forward to more experiences here!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place !! It's my new, go-to place for lunch in Davidson. It's a lot of food so it's best if I've had no breakfast or I can take the eco-sensitive container home for dinner (which I confess I've never had to do ;)  Some of my friends have thought the menu was too complicated, but once you have taken the time to understand how it works, it's fabulous to have so many HEALTHY choices to put on either greens, grains, rice.  My favorite lunch going to build is on greens with: Spicy mushrooms, pickled onions, pickled cauliflower, crunchy quinoa, sweet potatoes, and hummus. Then there's the Spicy Green and Lemon Tabini sauces I order drizzled on top. YUM.  And don't worry, you meat lovers. My husband tried the chicken and said it was absolutely delicious. And he enjoyed the barbecue sauce drizzled on top.  Maybe check out the website ahead of time or just come in and figure out the menu, because it is definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Happy, happy tastebuds! Thank you Davidson Ice House for existing. Today I had the pleasure of experiencing your deliciousness. Such a good pleasant surprise! I enjoyed the truffle potato soup and the Roman on greens. I was moving my shoulders in a little dance as I ate. The pickled cauliflower was to die for! I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"I so so wanted to love this place.  Alinos & Barcelona are amazing.  However, I ordered the Tree Hugger with grains, and half of my food was ice cold-the other half hot.   Hmmmmm not great aesthetically.  Also the mushrooms were listed as crunchy which apparently means fried (I was thinking just al dente).  They were yummy though.  Lastly, my husband ordered the buffalo bill and said it was too spicy.  He is someone who orders the spiciest wings/everything, so for him to say that means yikes!  And there really was nothing to indicate that.  My family was not impressed but I will definitely give them another shot with a friend."}
{"text":"Great quality ingredients at a great price. Very health conscious options. I highly recommend as someone who doesn't do gluten or dairy. Did I mention it's delicious?  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My only problem with this place is it's in Davidson. How do I get you to open one closer to me in uptown Charlotte?!!  Set in what was once town's ice house, I would describe this place as an upscale, New American, fast casual concept. It really caters to everyone as the menu covers all dietary restrictions.  Our order: Paleo A-Go-Go (meatballs, maple glazed sweet potatoes, roasted black beans, kale slaw, pink onions, ratatouille, spicy green sauce), The Davidsonian (cast iron chicken, grilled slaw, MG sweet potatoes, lemon cauliflower, kale slaw, pimento cheese, apricot), Sidewinder Fries, and Crunchy Mushrooms (a must order). All of the components are so well done and delicious. They're good alone and even better together. Lemon cauliflower is something you need in your life. Don't see a bowl you like? Build your own!   We ended our meal with lemon blueberry cookies that were warm and right out of the oven. So damn delicious. I definitely had two and they were worth every calorie."}
{"text":"First time here and somewhat happy with it. Decent meal, got the beefy meatballs which unfortunately were not beefy at all. 3 tiny meatballs on my plate of rice and vegetables. 3 stars because the other people I was with enjoyed their meals more than me. My meal and a beer was $20ish dollars. Not worth it. But will try again. One big plus was the outside seating on a nice night."}
{"text":"I was nervous to dry Davidson Ice House! Healthy food options can often go bland while people pretend, because of the health option, that it's delicious. The owner of Ice House knows what she's doing! The actual setup on the front end leaves a lot to be desired although the back room seems nice enough for this kind of establishment. The food- unreal good with so much flavor! I ordered \"the brûlée\"with both greens and rice as my base- so many flavors! My favorite pieces of this bowl include the grilled slaw, the tickled pink onions, the corn and the chicken itself... but the spicy green sauce is the best thing I've ever tasted and added the perfect spice and flavor for me!! My husband made his own and used the creamy pesto and the lemon tahini sauces over top- yummy! I can't say it enough! We will be back soon, a fantastic addition to Davidson and a must try for everyone local!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food in area! Got take out from here and it was delicious. Great way to try new flavors you wouldn't think to put together."}
