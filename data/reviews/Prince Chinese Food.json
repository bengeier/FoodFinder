{"text":"Located in the old Denison Centre where all the seniors loiter all day, stands an old food court with a handful of food stalls.   It's been a while since I came here to eat so decided to give Prince Food a try.  Serving typical Cantonese fare such as rice and noodle dishes its a good option to grab a quick bite.

Its a typical Chinese family run joint with the wife in the front, husband in the kitchen and the kids on the counter;).  Ordered the egg plant and fried fish fillet on rice.  The portion is huge and not bad especially for the price paid.  

The family seems friendly and that's always a plus.  Decent choice especially if you want to hang out with all the seniors;)"}
{"text":"On a whim, ordered from Prince after learning (late to the party) that an old favorite, Heaven's Gold had closed permanently. Heartbroken and hangry, ordered a beef and broccoli chow mein from here. The fried noodles were not your average - less yellow, extra crispy, not as thin as usual. But the chow mein was awesome! Cooked very fast and well. Comes with a soy milk."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the food court at Kennedy and Denison. 

I normally get the fried beef noodles and love that dish. The beef is done well, the noodles are perfect and coated with soy, without tasting salty, and the dish comes with bean sprouts. I am a bean sprouts whore, after all!

The other week, I wanted to change up my order, so I went with the yeung chow fried rice. It had a lot of egg, barbecued pork, peas, and more. It was perfectly done. I got a lot for $5! I also got a soy beverage to wash my dinner down. 

The folks there speak Cantonese and English. I started ordering in English. The man seemed to be confused, so I switched to Cantonese and all was well. The woman had a better command of English. Both were friendly. 

The wait was short. If you want fast, cheap, authentic Chinese food, stop by here."}
