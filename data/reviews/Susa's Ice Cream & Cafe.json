{"text":"The ice cream was delicious!! It's all Hersey ice cream and lots of different flavors. My Dad was able to get a pineapple sundae, which is a real treat -- it was real pineapple pieces! I got a waffle cone. There are fun little games on the tables too, which is cute!!"}

{"text":"A cute, clean little ice cream shop. There's a small little area in the front of the store to watch TV. The owners seem nice and very helpful. The ice cream was very good and my 3-year old was very happy. There are a few outdoor seats. The parking lot is a little awkward but overall a good experience. We will be back!"}

{"text":"This ice cream place is exactly what we've been looking for by our house. We randomly stopped in after our son's competition. The owners are amazingly friendly and welcoming. They have a kids area for them to play and hang out.  My favorite part is....they serve Hershey's ice cream! The prices aren't high like those chain places. You can get a brownie sundae for $5.00. We got a waffle cone with two scoops and a sugar cone with one scoop for $6.70. They also serve coffee, cookies and hot dogs. I will definitely be coming back even with the 30 minute drive! Highly recommend to everyone!"}
