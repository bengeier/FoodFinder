{"text":"wow! the best pizza. the owner and his wife a really friendly, wonderful people!"}
{"text":"Best place in Pickering to go if your looking for some pizza. Service is quick and the pizza is reasonably priced. The pizza here is better tasting than it's alternatives Little Caesars and Pizza Pizza. The staff are a bit creepy but it doesn't matter because it only takes a minute to order a pizza."}
{"text":"I used to order pizza from them all the time even though they usually get my order wrong. I ordered from them recently and again it was a very disappointing experience. We ordered on the phone and we even confirmed the order to make sure they got it right and they said yes and then when they came by we opened the pizza box in front of them and it was not where we ordered so we asked them to remake it and instead of being polite about it the guy just stormed off without saying anything. Will NOT order again."}
{"text":"If you need a quick pepperoni pizza for movie night or to chase beers during the game, wander up for the walk - in special. Occasionally they have a hot veggie slice that will knock your wool socks off.
Not the best pizza ever, but a convenient neighborhood location."}
{"text":"This place is cool. I paid $14  for a large pizza and got to put as many toppings as I wanted on it. They aren't gourmet toppings but they have all the usual options (and even feta and chicken). I was worried going in that there would be like two pieces of each topping, but in actually, there was the same amount of each as if I'd paid the $2 per topping at other places. The sauce and crust are average. The service was quick and courteous. The interior of the place is ugly and ridiculous (full-wall picture of a family staring at a pizza... uh huh) but there are only three chairs and no tables so it's not like you'll be staying for the dining experience anyway. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Good pizza and good value.  Usually drop by for a quick snack before heading home.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, generous even the toppings! Choose the basic ones such as olives, extra cheese, onions,...
The toppings like ham, bacon or anchovies are in a small quantity. 
But still, fair price for good pizza! I recommend!!
Ã‰DIT: the delivery guy was very rude, begging for a tip as soon as we opened the door."}
{"text":"The man who runs this place is a good looking Eurasian man who is extremely friendly to everyone. Tonight I went to buy a slice and I couldn't decide between what they had made. He offered to make me any kind of pizza I wanted just for a slice! Even Hawaiian! I decided to just buy a Canadian slice because I didn't want him to be stuck having to sell the rest of my unwanted pizza. They have chocolate milk, rootbeer AND Dr. Pepper!"}
