{"text":"I found myself here on Christmas night after putting my parents in a local hotel after they lost their electricity. I was really surprised to see this place bustling with people on such a family oriented night, but it was a good crowd.  I hadn't eaten much all day and was hankering for some food. I ordered their curry chicken $5.95 special. The meal was pretty light on the curry chicken and heavy on the vegetables. I love veggies, but after checking your parents into a Toronto hotel on Christmas Day and paying the bill, you begin to question a lot of what you're paying for. Served with a small portion of rice I didn't feel it was worth the six dollar price tag.  In all fairness they seem to have two menus (& two different sets of prices) and perhaps the portion of chicken is more voluminous in the other menu. I came with a friend (who's a regular) and I got to mooch some holiday cake from the bar due to that association.  The staff (including chef/line cooks) are very friendly and have some fun with you if you try to speak Mandarin with them."}
{"text":"this is a dive bar , really, at its best. cheap food that is pretty good, cheap beer and sometimes karaoke. you want a really cheap pint away from home, this is it st clair peeps."}
{"text":"I'm totally impressed with this establishment. The owner Alice is by far one of the best hostess. Makes you feel welcome always. They have a jukebox,  pool table, TVs, fully stocked bar. Great portions, great price."}
{"text":"This is a friendly, fun bar.  'Went there last Saturday night for the first time. There was a kick ass band playing behind the pool table (The Allnighters). Everyone was having a good time. The staff  is friendly and the drinks are more than reasonable, $3.50 for a domestic beer!  With prices like that you can afford to have a great night out and go home feeling good about it.    We didn't order any of the food but the menu was extensive and the price averaged about $5.95 per dish which is rare days."}
{"text":"Ok, so, hey, don't take this the wrong way or take me for a racist ass or anything, but if I were in Thailand or China or Singapore and wanted to find a bar that offered cheap but really good food served by petite, smiling Asian women, Brothers is exactly the kind of place I could find myself walking into.  Oh, the fantasy possibilities...  but I digress.  All I wanted was a cold beer after a hard day at work.  Brothers' on-tap choices is pretty limited to one (Amber lager the night I was there), but the Pepsi cooler is stacked with plenty of icecold bottles to be had between a dirtcheep $3.75 (local beers) to $4.50 (imports).  How can you go wrong?  And one look at the plate of food that the guy next to me ordered, and I knew I had to have something to compliment the Canadians I was sucking back as the AC/DC blared from the sound system and the soccer game was on the TV.    Oh, hey, they make General Tso's.  My favourite non-Chinese Chinese dish.  Awesome.  And... it was.  Medium sized bits of chicken, crisp on the outside and meaty inside, served with red and green peppers in that spicy sauce.  Theirs had a strong but not unpleasant soy aftertaste that just had me enjoying more Canadians as I munched and discussed the TTC St. Clair  streetcars with the dude beside me.  They serve all the basic Chinese fare that most Westerners have come to expect, and seem to do it well.  No steamed dumplings sadly, but wonton soup, kung pao chicken, mussels in black bean sauce, satay beef, Cantonese chow mein, etc etc.    And did I mention the friendly, smiling, goodlooking staff?  I did?  Oh.  Ok, then."}
{"text":"Two pool tables with solid, intact cues, cheap beer, friendly bartenders and lots of TVs. Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to have a chill night"}
{"text":"I like the wings, I like their secret hot sauce recipe. It's a dive bar for sure, but I like it."}
