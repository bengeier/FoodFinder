{"text":"We went in here today, ordered our sandwiches and when we went to pay. Guess what apparently our card was declined. See I have more than enough money on my card but used cash to make it even. So in front of customers told me my card was declined. I decided to walk over to food for less and get a print out from an ATM. Guess what I walked back and showed her the print out. They did nothing! Horrible customer service. We went to Subway and guess what it worked and when I told them what happened at port of subs they threw in a free sand which. This is what happened the dumb cashier prob entered in it wrong and needs to be retrained. Doesn't need to announce in from of customers that our card was declined. I have never be so humiliated in my life. I will also be contacting corporate."}
{"text":"Sub sandwich was yummy - loved the smoked cheddar!  The young lady working on that Sunday afternoon was excellent.  Extremely efficient, clearly cared about customers and about doing a good job.  I'm not from the area, but if I were, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"I went to grab a grilled sandwich the other night for dinner.  The gentleman working the counter was extremely rude, snapped at me stating that I could not order a grilled sandwich because it was after 8:30.   I still ordered, but had to settle for something I really didn't want.   I was at another location today and they appologized saying that is not true, you can order grilled sandwhiches up until closing.  Needless to say, I will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Will never eat at this location the owner was not very friendly when I tried to use my port of subs rewards card told me I don't give out free subs and don't take coupons I eat at port of subs all over vegas this store looked like the old stores from 1990 all the port of subs I go to look new and updated not this location I would not eat there looks old and does not take coupons or port of subs cards go to a different location that is much friendly and takes coupons let's send a message to this owner this is unacceptable thanks."}
{"text":"Worst Port of Subs Ever! The meat was not even thick enough to make it from the slicer down to the sandwich. Then they threw on the toppings like it was a game of ultimate frisbee. Then they cut the sandwich on the wrapping tearing it prior to throwing it in a bag. By the time we arrived at our destination we had to try and piece together our sandwich so we could eat it. Just a lot of cost cutting that sacrificed the quality of the product. This area already has a severe lack of food options, I am sad that I cannot frequent this place in the future."}
{"text":"We went to this location for lunch today and it was great very good customer service excellent price"}
{"text":"On a week day I order 2 sandwiches and it took them 1 hour and 15 minutes to deliver it!!! Oh wait I only live 5 minutes away . The sandwiches are good but was kinda warm when it got here. Worst part was that when the delivery girl got here she gave us a totally different receipt with a different total aswell!!! I showed them the total I had off of yelp ordering online , it didn't matter I just need to pay what the receipt said so I called port of subs , talk the manager and she says yes the pricing is all wrong on line and the receipt she giving me was rite??? Did I mention it was not total by the register! It was hand written down on the piece of paper.. Too bad I really liked this place and the employees just don't care! worst customer service! Lazy"}
{"text":"There are more than a few places in North Las Vegas for sandwiches, but this particular Port of Subs has dealt with me very well on more than a few occasions. I want to give kudos particularly to George and Andrew, who seem to always be working when I come in, and they know how particular I can be about my sandwiches.  They are patient, respectful, and they seem sincere in pleasing the customer.  They keep a tidy work area, and while they don't plaster fake smiles when you come in, they greet every customer and it doesn't seem contrived.  Their greetings vibe with their own characters.    So, about the sandwiches....They taste fresh to me.  I do like their sandwich menu.  They use real avocados and not an \"avocado smear,\" like at another popular sandwich shop.  I just feel that the bread is better, although I can only speak from my white bread perspective.  I've never tried their flatbread or wraps. They are in an Arco station, so it's easy to get a bite and get some gas, too.  Prices can vary, but it depends on the size of the sandwich.  They have two-feet sandwiches on special at $12.99--one style/type of sandwich only, but they give them to you separately wrapped as foot-longs.  You can definitely get a decent single sandwich below $10, without drink or chips.  The product will either stand on its own merit or not, but a business in a highly competitive industry can often survive hard times with the quality of service they render.  In particular, there is and will continue to be a road closure right at their intersection between North 5th and Tropical.  This reduces potential traffic and potential customers.  What keeps their base of customers will be product delivery.  These two young men deliver customer service that would make the franchise owner proud, and I hope he's reading this now and acknowledges the efforts of these two and the rest of his staff.  I have had only positive interactions here, beyond George and Andrew, but of course, I don't know the names of all the staff to include in this review."}
{"text":"They have a big sign stating that the meat is never prepackaged or pre-sliced.  I ordered pastrami.  And it was prepackaged and pre-sliced.  She pulled it our from a fridge.  It was in a cup.  So much for that gimmick. The bread wasn't very fresh.  The ladies were friendly.  The food was ok. No better than a Subway."}
{"text":"I only gave 2 stars because the food is usually pretty good. But come on they only gave me a little bit of onion. What's up with that! If I were anyone getting a sandwich I would suggest you go some place else that isn't so sparingly on the onion. It's super annoying. And I asked for extra and this is what I got! Haha pathetic!"}
{"text":"Wow...prolly the best sub I have had in awhile!"}
{"text":"For me to waste my time writing a review, the service HAD to have been awful.  I have gone to this location several times, and last night Wednesday July 13 was not a good experience.  Whoever the young African American girl was working that night is absolutely horrible!  Not one bit friendly, she seems like she hates her job, and makes you feel like you are inconveniencing her.  Here is some advice, if you don't like your job, then find a new one...preferably one where YOU never have to deal with customers seeing how you are not a people person.  I will never go back to that location again. I would rather drive to one 20 min out of my way where I can receive good service."}
{"text":"Port of Subs is really good, but you have got to be in a money spending mood. Port of Subs is like an upgraded Subway. The people are nicer, the service is better, but their subs are more expensive."}
{"text":"Ashamed to say, but I've never tried Port Of Subs. This review is strictly based on this location's customer service. My son is having a birthday party soon so I called to inquire about their party platter. I spoke with a guy named William and his customer service could not have been any better!!! He was cheerful and happy to answer any and all of my questions. He also assured me to call back if I had any further questions. Although this is the first place I called in regards to catering, I will definitely being ordering from Port Of Subs. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that I called the wrong location, therefore won't be order directly from this location, however will be ordering from the other Eastern location thanks to William!"}
{"text":"Port of Subs is basically a higher end Subway. I mean that in a good way though. You still build your sandwich behind a sneeze guard like Subway, but... they actually hand slice all the meats and cheeses, and imho have a slightly better selection of add-ons."}
{"text":"Freaking love Port of Subs. It's all about numbers 5 and 8."}
{"text":"If you're into minimalism, and subs that offer nothing more than fresh sliced meat this is the place for you. Nothing hits the spot like bland bread and a bare minimum add ons which are skimpily placed. I don't go to sub places for cookies or shakes, I go to eat subs. However fresh the meat may be, I would highly doubt they use even a par brand of meat. You want the best subs and sandwiches in the city, Cugino's is the only place in Vegas..scratch that, Nevada that knows what there're doing. The breads are fresh, meat is always freshly sliced and the fresh mozzarella is literally made fresh every day. Jimmy johns has more of unique taste than Port of Subs. You want to swear by something, swear by good quality and food that speaks for its self. Vegas is by no means known for its food, and this Port of Subs place pays homage to that. Cuginos... thats all.     EDIT 1- I made a Yelp account just so I could tell the world how sub par this place really is.."}
{"text":"When my husband and I stopped in last week a brand new employee quickly smiled and greeted us very friendly, there was a woman in front of us that was very particular about her sandwich and the new employee was taking good care of her. A woman came in from the back ( smelled of strong cigarette smoke) and had been talking to a man for a few minutes in lobby area who left shortly, the wonan quickly started to yell at the new worker in front of everyone and telling him to work faster and that he can't be so slow. The new man ( employee)  tried to hurry as fast as he could but she continued to raise her voice and harrass him. All customers were shocked as no one was complaining of his service. The customer he was helping at the time tried to explain to the woman in charge that she had asked him to make her sandwich perfectly and that he wasn't slow at all. The woman in charge cut her off rudely and raised her voice to tell the customer that the man she was talking to was corporate and the new employee needs to work faster. The customer then asked for a number or comment card so that she and other customers in establishment could let corporate know that the new employee was doing a great job. The woman refused her request . The new employee continued to try to make woman in charge happy and he said nothing. There was another man working behind counter that never said a word ( he appeared to be embarrassed and scared ti say anything). This was the worst experience and I can't believe anyone would stay employed there! He would have been treated better begging for money on the freeway entrance!  I called port of sub corporate office 3 times to inform area supervisor or any other above this location on N Rainbow and Cheyenne, and not one person would return my call after i left messages to please contact me. I will never eat in their establishments and I will make sure to share this rediculious experience with everyone I know!!! SHAME ON YOU ....subway is better anyway and I hope that poor employee sues your company for harrassment"}
{"text":"Sad... I would never thought that a sandwich could be so bad. Service was horrible.. It a sandwich!!!  Not rocket science.  It is safe to say that I will not be going back.. They should close it down or get rid of the help.."}
{"text":"I'd been here once before and actually had an okay experience. The second time was a complete disaster; I arrived 20 minutes before the listed closing time, and the employees rushed to the door to lock it and merely stood there expecting me to leave. That's a pretty surefire way to get me to let people know the night staff is lazy and to avoid this place if possible."}
{"text":"Best Subway shop in town!  Good service, fresh ingredients and great ambiance.  We try nit to buy in any Subway shop but this one is so good we frequent it."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to say that the reason we tried Port of Subs is that the Panda Express next door was full (at 1pm)!   I tried the cheesesteak, and my buddy had a hot pastrami with swiss. They cooked them up well ~ not faux cooking like at Subway. The result was a very decent cheesesteak. I was a bit bummed because they didn't have any tomato sauce or ketchup to go on top. I'm originally from Jersey, and I don't know why, but I like ketchup on my cheesesteaks. It was OK though ~ since the rest was so good.  My buddy liked his pastrami on swiss, commenting that he doesn't like rye bread, so he liked the fact that he could get his pastrami on a plain old white roll.  Oh, also, they had one of those new digital Gold Peak iced tea machines and served Coke Zero. Bonus points for good beverage choices!  So far, so good. I'll try it again sometime and see if my review gets better or worse!"}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this location many times a week. The store is always clean and the employees are always friendly. Most times I don't even have to tell them my order because they remember us right away. Our sandwiches are always made perfectly and are fresh. The cookies at this location are also much better than any other port of subs I've tried. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money at this port of subs. It closes whenever the owner decides she wants it to without notice and without regard to her customers. I complained and instead of taking the initiative and saying she was sorry, she was condescending. The owner does not appreciate her customers and would rather save a buck than satisfy her customers. I won't go back."}
{"text":"We ate there today and the food is great.  Sandwich made exactly as we ordered.  Very clean inside and very friendly employees.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First time here. They were completely out of the meatballs, so I couldn't get the sub I wanted. This might be excusable if it were 15 minutes until close. However, they were open for another 4 hours. This is a massive failure to properly plan ahead and manage the restaurant. Also, the trash cans by the outdoor seating area were ALL overflowing onto the ground. Another sign of the inattention to detail that seems to characterize this place. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Great Sub Sandwich's!  We have been to this location twice now and both times the food was great.  We went there on Labor Day and there was no wait but the customer service was even more amazing.  Crystal was very friendly and acted like she loves her job.  We will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Port of Subs is so much better than the other big national chains. I grew up on 'em and love their sandwiches. A must stop for me whenever I'm back in Nevada"}
{"text":"Won't accept Franchise Coupons and also won't accept Loyalty Cards unless the majority of the stamps came from their location."}
{"text":"Rude & Unprofessional  I sent my daughter in with the sandwich card ready to be redeemed - it was a little old so she asked if she could use it before ordering.  Apparently the owner Mike Egan felt that the card had been stolen and falsified because the signatures were not consistent with his methods.  He assumed the worst and was extremely rude and hostile to my daughter, treating her as a criminal.  I spoke to Mr. Egan and as expected he denied treating her in such a fashion regardless of the other eye witness accounts.  He stated that because there were so many of the same stamps/signatures it looked suspicious.  Well yes Mr. Egan I have 7 people in my family, we buy 7 sandwiches at one time so the stamping and signatures would be consistent for a transaction of 7. Rather than ask questions, he was a bully.  I had previously heard rumors that he mistreats his employees, is rude and has even had employees quit on the spot.  After this incident I believe the rumors and don't doubt any of the witnesses.  While he has a right to deny using a card, he doesn't have the right to traumatize my daughter (or anyone else) which is exactly what he did.   I can assure everyone that I will take my business to the local Subway for now on."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've tried Port of Subs. I always thought it would be a normal sandwich sub place like Subway or Blimpie and I'm normally willing to drive to Capriotti's or Jimmy Johns. Port of Subs was a nice surprise.  I got a medium (5\" for about $5 something)  #1 on wheat which is ham, cappacola, & salami. It was a fatty with lots of meat. I thought they'd be stingy like how subway is with their meat. The size was actually pretty big for being 5\". My boyfriend got a large which is 12\" and he couldn't finish it all. I got mine topped with lettuce, red onions, black olives, thinly sliced pickles, and peppers. It was pretty damn good! The bread soft and fresh.   The establishment is clean and the staff are very helpful and nice. I will definitely return again since it is so close to where I live!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Walked in and never got greeting or even a smile from the employees. There was 3 people ahead of me and I waited patiently to be helped. As cece asked \"what do you want\" I told her and it took her 5 minutes to cut the 3 pieces of meat and cheese. She was so slow the other worker had people waiting to pay while she helped cut meat much more efficiently. I left without a sub because it took another 10 minutes for them to ask what I wanted on the sub."}
{"text":"When On Vacation In Oceanside Caifornia I Visit  The Pacific Coast Hwy And Oceanside Ave Location. The Sandwiches Are Excellent. Fresh Bread, Meat, Baked Goods And Vegetables. Very Good Customer Service."}
{"text":"Not so hot. Been in their for pick up several times, was Ok. Kind of baffled as to why, when I used their online order for delivery, it accepted my order and no order arrived. Called and found out why. They made the order, but they don't delivery on weekends. Not delivery on Saturday? Really? Aren't Friday and Saturday heavy revenue days? Can't really believe that when an online order occurred clearly stating delivery and they did not delivery, they still made it? Very disappointing that even basic curiosity isn't extended to at least call and inform the customer no food."}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience.  My sub was sloppy and had a big chunk of the bad part of lettuce. I could not even eat my lunch that I paid for me and my daughter. I'm highly disappointed and will not be back to this location. Which is sad since I live so close to this one."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad that had another food in it other than what I ordered...The Manager(Randy) instead of asking anything like can he prepare me another or anything what so ever tells the preparer (Martha) something in Spanish which I don't speak which was obviously take it out and then he hands me my salad no apology or anything...strangely enough I have been on the toilet all night since eating from this establishment since their cleanliness is obviously not a priority...Would not recommend ever visiting this particular Port of Subs!"}
{"text":"Got to love this place not only because they are open till 2 a.m. but they are clean and fast"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone. Not only they have good sandwiches but they have a secret menu #19 chicken and Turkey my favorite"}
{"text":"Go to portofsubs.com and sign up for online ordering!!!!! Use promo Code....ROME!!!!!.. 20% off on your first order no matter if your a first time guest!!!  Or a loyal GUEST come see us!!!"}
{"text":"Well, this is a nice little place.  I kept it simple and did a #1 which is an Italian Sub, I went with the Large and its HUGE! Meat freshly cut and piled on as well as the cheese. Very tasty to add. The toppings are very much like Subway, as well as the chip and drink selection. I spent a little over $10 for the Combo and have to say it was worth the extra $2 or so over Subway. Its close to my work, so I'd go back again. If ever faced with a choice in another area between Subway and Port O' Subs, I'd skip Subway and go here instead.  The higher quality meat was worth the extra $$. Subway meat always tastes like the plastic it comes in. This does not because its freshly sliced."}
{"text":"I pass two other Port of Subs just to go to this location. They know know their bread. Also, the staff is consistent and friendly."}
{"text":"I put in an order online an hour before I needed it and then arrived 10 minutes after pickup. I did his purposely so I could make sure I could run in and out really quick because I had a tight schedule. Not only were my 2 sandwiches not made, they hadn't even looked at their system to see that an order had come in. I thought that was the point of ordering online. It's disappointing since only one of the 2 girls were actually working when I walked in and 2 other people came in after me. Frustrating"}
{"text":"This place is horrible the women can barely understand English and then they said 25 minutes for delivery it been an hour and a half I had to call to ask where my stuff was they didn't call me. I have ordered before online here and they never delivery I called said they never got an online order from me. Maybe you should hire a staff who can do their job and call a customer back and let them know there are delays."}
{"text":"I have come here everyday for the last year and it's for a reason!  The staff is amazing and food is delicious.  I never get sick of it and am glad they are right around the corner from me.  They are always quick and friendly.  Can't say enough about how amazing this place is!"}
{"text":"Great staff. Occasionally visit this store and often call in before hand. Staff politely answers and takes my order with no issues. Arrive, pick up, pay my bill and off I go ...simple and easy and what more can I ask for.. Store has been in this neighborhood for years now and I have never had an issue. Parking is easy and easy access to Windmill. Never a long line and staff is very efficient and fast. Thanks guys. Your owner should be proud to have you as staff members."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Not just for the convenience being my work is practically in the same lot but for the excellent service I get EVERY time. I always go during the lunch rush and my meal never short of amazing! It may just be a sandwich, a wrap or a flatbread but David always takes good care of us and his staff is always so friendly and accommodating. Sometimes nicer than the servers I get t fine dining restaurants LOL Needless to say BEST port of subs in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"The sub was basic,  nothing special. Bread dry and hard.  Girl making the sub had not a clue what she was doing. They have a sign outside with the listed sub of the day that the worker had not a clue what was on it or it was even there. I was the only one there and she took forever to make 1 stand alone sub. Wouldn't  go back."}
{"text":"Always a good stop for a cold cut sammich, the staff is great, and the fresh cuts and bread have never disappointed.  This has quickly became one my favorite spots to grab a bite.  The time it takes to order and sit down or leave is great, staff seems to be of higher education level than Subway; I never have to repeat myself and I don't need to hold their hand through the entire process.  They know what their doing and the portions and over all look of the sandwich is great!  You can actually taste everything that goes on your food compared to some shops that just taste like bread with sauce on it."}
{"text":"Never thought it would be so hard to make a good sandwich. The sandwich was a huge mess that was basically coming out of the wrapper. And apparently a lot of oil and vinegar means a tiny bit"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great, much better than Subway. The employees here are especially friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sandwich shops. The bread is always fresh, the meats and cheeses delicious. When you walk in, the staff greets you and is very attentive to your order. If you get a stamp card after 10 sandwiches you get a freebie.. Also it doesn't hurt that it's right across street from ASU and offers great sights."}
{"text":"I will never visit this sandwich shop again. I went in after lunch hours and ordered a 8 inch roast beef and cheese add avocado. I have ordered this at numerous other shops with great results. At this place the 3 slices of cheese were sliced so thin I could almost see through them. the 3 slices of roast beef were equally thinly sliced. The topper was I was charged $1.25 for 3 slices carved from a quarter avocado that each had the thickness of a nickel. total price 8.99 for about a dollars worth of ingredient. if you want a fair priced  meal go anywhere but this Port of Subs."}
{"text":"**Update** Both the District Manager and the Corporate Headquarters of Port of Subs contacted me and made the situation right.  They informed me that they would be addressing this situation and apologized for the way I was treated.  I will not return to this Port of Subs location but will continue to go to others.  Thanks Port of Subs!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Port of Subs.....I've been to most of them and they don't even come close. If these people ran any business it would be successful."}
{"text":"This is the best Port of Subs. Friendly staff and owner. Their bread is always fresh and they have never disappointed. I am here at least 2-3 times a week. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"I love port of subs but not at this location. I ordered a sandwich to go and this was the first time I did not finish my sandwich. Not because it was to much, it was only a 5 inch sandwich, but because the bread was discussing. It did not taste right. Not sure if it was day old bread or what but I will be going to another location next time."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We eat here about once a week.  Gives me a break from cooking and everything on the menu is fresh.  I don't like Subway and I don't like hot subs from Quizno's.  People are friendly too.  Good place to go to relax with the family."}
{"text":"Good food, always fast, always customers in there but never crazy/busy.  Close to the freeway to take on the way home from work."}
{"text":"Port of Subs is a big time Subway knock off...  Dude, I had a veggie sandwich from PoS and it was totally and utterly tasteless (wheat bread with lettuce, tomato, pepperoncini, olives and pickles).  Although I will say this -  Subway serves this exact same sandwich, and it is just as tasteless.  Which begs the question, why would PoS copy this crap?  Answer: CRAP + UNORIGINAL = PoS (piece of sh*t)"}
{"text":"Hands down best Port of Subs in town. Not only do you get a good sandwich every time but also such a clean location to eat at if you wish. Has a very friendly, younger staff who does thier best to make your sandwich the way you'd like it. Now with that being said and the main reason i eat there (besides i live in Anthem).....this owner gives back to the community....not only does he support our local high schools but everything kids do in our area he supports. Whether it be soccer.....baseball....lacross....football...etc, he has no problem donating not only food but also sponsors teams....why would you go to anyone else ?I cant even count the times where he says \"just a sandwich...here,take this cup on me\" Not alot of business owners like this around anymore because of this economy. Im lucky to have this place in my neighborhood and will continue to spend my hard earned money there !!"}
{"text":"I've always liked Port of Subs but I think this experience is worth sharing.  Their posted hours for Sundays are from 9am to 9pm.  So I walk in at about 7pm on a Sunday; the lights were on, \"open\" sign blazing, and the guy behind the counter asked me \"What can I get for you?\"  So, the idiot that I am, I assumed they were open for business.  Evidently not.  I wasn't eyeballing the counter too hard so I didn't notice that they had put the bread and such away until he very laboriously dragged it back out.  He sighed and scowled at me the entire time, and was sarcastic and rude whenever he spoke.  He made it extremely clear that he wanted me out of his shop and wished that I hadn't come in.  It was also made clear to me that they had to re-open the register for my order.  I've worked in a shop before, and I really did feel guilty.  I know what it's like to have people come in just before closing, but I've never treated a customer that badly just for some last minute business.  But the kicker is that it was 2 hours before posted closing time, and they hadn't bothered to turn off the sign OR lock the door, even though they had apparently shut down the register.  I'm not a mind reader; I don't know you're closing 2 hours early unless I'm told.  He could have easily said \"sorry, we've just closed\" and I would have said \"oh sorry dude\" and walked out, no problem.  Though I was getting sandwiches for my parents, I'm sure they could have lived with something else.  With the same ingredients, I can make better ones at home.  I'm glad I wasn't getting anything for myself, because after the way this man treated me I doubt I would have wanted to eat it.  I don't know why they happened to be closing early, and I don't care.  I just wish the older gent that \"served\" me had been honest and said they'd closed instead of using his precious five minutes to treat me like a rat turd in his lentil soup.  Needless to say, I've been put off and I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"Ordered my \"grilled\" sandwiches online and then went to pick them up.  It took 6 employees and 5 minutes  to try to find my order.  I watched each of  them look in through the fridges and coolers.  Finally someone found them in the microwave!  They were luke warm, who knows how long they were sitting in there with mayo on them.  When I got home the sandwiches were soggy.  Never going back again."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this location over several years and I cannot say enough good things about the friendly service, the clean store, and the fast and efficient checkout process.  Most of the employees have learned my name and my sandwich.  This whole team is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I go to Port of Subs all the time, but I had not been to this location in a long time.  I will not be going back anytime soon.  Water was leaking from the ceiling in several places.  It dripped on my back a few times while ordering until I finally realized and looked up.  I ordered two extra large sandwiches, they made three.  I have never seen a store skimp on the meat as much as this place.  You give cheap service, you get cheap customers.  This was a one time deal."}
{"text":"I was probably here at the worst possible time.. Meaning the best possible time to write a review.  The staff was completely overwhelmed by the lunch rush. There are a Lot of office buildings around so it's a hot spot between 11a-1p.  But even though they were backed out the door with customers these guys were pros!  It took about 10 minutes to find a parking spot and another 10 to get my sandwich but considering the 15 people in front of me that's not bad at all and the sandwich was great.  Thanks PortOSubs crew you guys were amazing"}
{"text":"Delicious tuna subs. It's a change of pace from the subways of the world and the people are friendly. Very clean and nice roomy seating."}
{"text":"The staff that work here are great. They came from a different location at the Lakes and I had been going to that one 3-4 times a month for 10 years or so. I have always been treated well and the food is always fresh and tasty. Even though the new location is farther away I still choose to patronize it.  You won't be dissapointed........"}
{"text":"The guys there are awesome! Super friendly and fast. That's the only location I go to and I order every time the exact same thing. The vegetarian......what made me come back is that they cleaned out the cutting machine before they cut my cheese. I really appreciate that and they do it every single time."}
{"text":"Had an online oder of 7 sandwiches and waited over an hour for it to be done; both the time it sent me that it will be done and me waiting in the store. Management needs to train staff with handling customers better and scheduling the appropriate employees. This place is very busy and while sitting waiting for the order three families had walked out. (I should have walked out, but I had 6 employees really hungry for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were great and made quickly.  Service was good intill Iasked for the restroom  key. When returning the key I tried handing it back to the young girl working . She looked disgusted and would not take the key. Made me feel like I was dirty, was not professional at all. I will never come back here!!  And btw she was picking her acne behind the counter, so who is the disgusting one. I am 8 months pregnant and love port of subs and again will never come back if she is working."}
{"text":"I have always found the staff to be courteous and in good spirits, the food to be good, and the facility to be clean and well maintained. If you are looking for fast food, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos! Clean, easy parking, and the food is always fresh and delicious. I was looking for food on my way to a conference. So glad I stopped, much better than Mandalay Bay or the LVCC!"}
{"text":"The best place to get a sub.  They give a lot of meat,  other places I have to get double meat.  The place is always nice and clean as well as the work stations. Bathrooms are well kept as well."}
{"text":"I work right up the street from this Port of Subs and decided to give it a shot since I was burned out on my usual rotation.  I really like it, nice change of pace.  Very tasty number 5, turkey, ham and cheese.  Service is fast and friendly.  Lots of room, easy to get a seat even during busy times.  Will definitely be back, frequently."}
{"text":"Will miss Cassandra! Great employee  Thank you Jeff, Angie. Zack 4 the best too! Great service! Clean! Very friendly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this port of subs often and I must tell you everything is always amazing!!! Expecially Lisa she always greets us with the most genuine smile, she makes sure everything is exactly how we want it and always makes us feel so welcome everytime. On top of all that, she makes the best sandwiches ever! We will continue  to support this location."}
{"text":"Best sub sandwich spot in the world ... #1 on white is the Realest classic Italian possible. U won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This location is consistently awful.  The last three times I've been, there have been only TWO people working during lunch rush.  Each time, one of them knows what they are doing, and the other one clearly does not.  Pairing one experienced and one inexperienced worker during a lunch rush is just a bad idea.  Line out the door, and the new ones can never figure out the basics.  One day a manager was so focused on the cash register and just collecting $$ and upselling that she did nothing to help the line move along.  Today the girl could not for the life of her figure out how to add sub points to my rewards card.  Given the long line waiting, I told her to forget it; I did ask for the receipt that was already printed out, and she said \"I can't give that to you, it is for our records.\"  HUH?!?!?!    The sandwiches are usually okay (though I've had some newbies totally mangle my sandwiches in the past) but the service here is, overall, consistently poor.  Quite the mismanaged location, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Everytime eat at this place, we always greeted with warm smiles and friendly staff especially the morning and mid afternoon.   The sandwiches are really good and you can customize them too  the place is clean even lunch hours. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Order was quick and the servers  even started a nice conversation with me along the way, kinda made the experience of ordering a sub 10x better. Honestly some of the best portions I've gotten at a PoS to this day, usually they skimp out on the amount of tuna given. While it wasn't overloaded, it was just right. I love their soda machine, really different from the standard soda machine at places like Subway, has many varieties and flavors to add.    Not only was the location clean and tidy, but the two servers (I believe their names were Courtlynne and Faith) made the experience even better."}
{"text":"I had driven past this restaurant several times and finally gave in and tried it for lunch.  I ordered a meatball sub and while it tasted good, I wasn't not impressed with the fact the meatballs were microwaved.  Next time I will try the turkey provolone sub since all the meat/cheese is freshly cut in front of you.  I was surprised to learn that there are two lines for ordering food."}
{"text":"How good can the review be...it's a franchise sub shop.  Non of them really make a \"great\" sub but then again I'm a little biased as I've had many \"hoagie's\" while visiting the east coast.  My only complaint about this place is the last time I checked they are not open in the evenings.  If you're going to build a location in what some people consider (wrongly) a less than desirable location then have the balls to keep it open with the SAME business hours as your other locations.  When you restrict your hours because you are to afraid of your neighborhood you alienate me and I take my business ELSEWHERE. Don't let racism dictate your business hours because it certainly doesn't dictate where I spend my money and so far you haven't received much of it since you aren't open in the evenings like the rest of your entire chain of restaurants."}
{"text":"I was always under the impression that money is filthy because of how many times it is handled in the situations that it is. The last time I was here the person making my sandwich was handling peoples money and never washing his hands or changing his gloves between each customer transaction.   Of course I spoke up but it was already too late for the numerous people that he had served. I guess that food handlers card Maricopa county made him get wasn't educational enough. Too bad I won't be going back here because their subs always tasted good.  Not good enough to die for and that's what food borne illness can do to you."}
{"text":"The ownership and management are a joke. No regard for customer service. Waited in line for 20 minutes at the slow part of the day to serve 3 customers. No apology for the wait. The girl who seems to be the daughter of someone acts like she's 12. The only thing I'd put her in charge of is a broom."}
{"text":"Do not think all Port of Subs are alike.  This location is AWFUL.  We've had bad service more than once.  We won't go back after the second time.  The bad service was unbelievable.  They actually argued with my co-worker over what she wanted on her sandwich and got really testy.  Just absolute jerks, I can't say it enough."}
{"text":"I love port of subs! I stop in so much the employees know exactly what I want. The workers are always friendly, I've never had a bad experience. I usually get the #1 which is Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese on white bread. They have their own mayo/mustard mix which is awesome so you don't have too much mustard and end up ruining it. They may not have as many selections of veggies as their competitors but at least their meat isn't made out of cardboard like some giant chain sub shops (cough*subway*cough). If you're in the mood for a sandwich and you're around the area defiantly give Port of Subs a try"}
{"text":"Terrible very disappointing, bacon was hard , guacamole acidic, the overall quality was poor , and on top for an 8' and 12' with sides and 2 drinks 32.00!!! I can spend that at a Red Robin or a similar restaurant easier, never will go back again Subway and fire house is way better"}
{"text":"The definition of terrible.  I never write reviews but this is actually worth the trouble. First  I walked in for the first to be half scolded by the manager because I didn't know what subs were excluded off the 'buy two get one free' after 5 pm special.  I ordered one Philly cheese steak and two turkey/ham and cheddar.  As I'm waiting for them to ask what toppings to put on a woman who just sat down with her kids comes up and says \"I think I need a fresh sub, mine is moldy\". As she sets it down it isn't just an isolated cluster of mold but basically the whole back side of a half sub.  Absolutely Disgusting.  And the worst part is the manager was in no rush to make her a new one and offered no refund, coupon or anything.  Mad that I continued after that as the lettuce and onions were just scraps at the bottom of the respective bins i paid and left. A dollar would have been too much money for these things, much less the 8-9 bucks they charge per sub.  If you need food quickly drive 30 more feet and hit the QT.  never again."}
{"text":"Love the Sandwiches.  Always fresh bread and they hit the spot.   Very friendly workers that always seem eager to help you."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that if you love/like Port of Subs, by all means, continue! I am merely one person with my own opinion and you don't have to pay a wit of attention to this! ....  Having said that, I blame myself for the lousy, ok, wretched sub I just had.   1.I  forgot, 2. was lazy and 3. had forgiven P.O.S. for their past sins.... I forgot that the last time I was at P.O.S. about 2 years ago, I hated their subs, I hated the sloppiness of them and the pitiful condiment/veggie selection.  I was lazy, there is a P.O. S. right by my house, so convenience was paramount today, I had been working around the house all day and when I realized the time, I was too lazy to drive to Subway/Jersey Mikes/Jason's Deli, hell even the gas station would have been better.  And going back to my #1 issue, I forgot how much I disliked P.O.S. that I forgave them, I thought maybe I had got a sub when one of the workers was having a bad day or maybe my tastebuds were having the bad day. So when I went there today all three of those issues came into play for me.  I gave this review one star because I will say this, the staff was very nice, very pleasant, and that goes a long way with me, I have boycotted other food joints for the service, I mean the food may have been great, but bad service will kill if for me, my money spends everywhere, and trust me, in Vegas, I can find hundreds of places I can eat at.  So to end my rant, which is what I feel like I have been doing, I dislike P.O.S., I dislike your sloppy, tasteless, pathetic attempt at being a reputable sub shop.  I will make a concerted effort to remember this, so in 2 years from now I won't find myself at P.O. S. again and kicking myself for not remembering that I could have got a better sub at the Albertson's pre-made sandwich section."}
{"text":"Nice subs, and really good service. Port of Subs is one of my favorite sandwich shops.  Unfortunately, their online ordering system is really bad. They have an antiquated fax system that almost never works. It's happened on my last four orders that I get there to pick up and am told they never received the order so I have to wait for them to make it. It's not a huge deal, but I also pay for it online when I order, so then I have to go through my phone to prove I've paid. They are aware that an email comes in with the order, but they don't check it. This all just makes me wonder why they bother offering online ordering at all.  Again, I want to stress that the food and the attitude of the employees is great. I just want them to make their system work correctly.   And stay open later than 8.30 pm!"}
{"text":"Shout out to the two guys that helped me today! I burst through the door at 6:25 and was starving and late for work, they had my sandwich ready in like 2 minutes flat and they were super nice. My favorite port of subs by far. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I love port of subs.. My man and I go to them all the time. Cheap, fast, and better than subway. This location was great. Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service even though they were crazy busy. Our sandwiches were tasty like usual. Love the smoked cheddar cheese!"}
{"text":"This place is frequently running out of ingredients. This is the 3rd time that they run out of the BBQ pulled pork out of the 5 times I've gone in the last month 1/2."}
{"text":"There are other Port of Subs locations closer to me, but I choose this one.  At least 80% of the time I get David, the best sub builder in the business!  The location itself always has fresh veggies and bread so my sandwich tastes good.  All of the people that help me are courteous and efficient, and they continue to be my sandwich shop of choice.  Thank you to David and everyone else at this location for always doing a great job."}
{"text":"Eh, it was ok. Sandwich was pretty bland even with all the fixings. Expensive for what you get.  Service was pretty slow. Ordered my sandwich, my two kids and then the worker ignored my husband and asked what the couple behind us what they wanted. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love to eat here. The owners are great people, Damon & Melissa. Just tell them that Tim G sent you."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this one for years. Staff is always friendly and food is always good. I came in today and as normal the staff was very friendly. I usually eat there but I took it to go today. I get home to take a bite and the bread is as hard as a crouton!! It was so hard that there is no way the person making the sandwich did not notice. It was so obvious. I'm sure he felt it cutting it and handling it. So it goes to show you there is no concern for customer service at that location. I will be hesitant to go back."}
{"text":"Used to be such terrible service here back in 2014. They have really done a much better job with hiring and the staff now is actually really nice. One of my fav spots now."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Have been waiting almost an hour and a half for a SANDWICH. I mean pizza places take less time and they actually have to cook. Seriously this place is horrible."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went here on a sunday to enjoy a sandwich. the gentleman making our sandwich I think his name was Hasahn. He was very kind and the sandwich was great..we will be back..#10"}
{"text":"The kids meal for $4 is just right. This location is quite spotty when it comes to service. Some workers are friendly, some are quite kurt... and I eat there 2-3/week. Also, the format/order that they make the sandwiches is a little off putting."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Upbeat and high energy from the whole staff. I ate my meal and watched them treat everyone with a smile. You can go to any place and grab a meal, but sometimes the positive atmosphere is the difference between going into one place vs another."}
{"text":"This is my second time ordering from this Port of Subs through the online portal and my second time being served late. The first time happened during a lunch rush, and the store will filled with people, and the staff was all clearly busy and working frantically to keep up with the number of customers, so I don't fault them for letting my online order fall through the cracks, that's to be expected.  This time, however, my order sat forgotten off to the side while several of the staff were idling, there were only three to five people in line for sandwiches, some of who were already being assisted. When I came to pick up the order around 15 minutes past when the order was scheduled to be ready for pickup, I was surprised to find that while the store was empty, my order had yet to be started. Most of the staff just asked each other where my order was on the assumption that was done, but upon realizing that it hadn't, I was asked to move so that the other customers could access the register. They didn't tell me that they hadn't started on my sandwiches yet, why they hadn't started on them, nor did they apologize for making me wait on my advance online order.  When my order was done, there was a mixup and they put someone else's sandwich in my bag, and when they tried to sort it out, the sandwiches were not labeled and it wasn't clear whose was whose. They packed my bag with my two sandwiches and handed it back to me, after having me pay ahead of time. When I received my bag, I asked about the cookie I'd ordered, which they didn't put in the bag. The lady working the register flat out told me that I hadn't ordered a cookie, without even checking my order. I asked her if she was sure, and she again told me that I hadn't ordered one, again without checking. I told her that I was pretty sure I ordered one, and asked if she could check the order sheet, which was on the counter right next to her. Once she'd bothered to look down at the piece of paper, she verified that did, and told me that it was ok to take a cookie. I was pretty taken aback at how bad service was, no effort was made to apologize or explain why things were so bad, just here's your late food, with the wrong order, goodbye.  Late service, bad service, messed up orders, I don't think I'll be coming here anymore.  It's not like it's hard to find alternatives. If you're looking for a sandwich in the area, go a little bit east and you'll find the Full Belly Deli, with great food and service. There's a Quiznos a little bit further east of that. If you go west down Deer Valley instead, you'll hit a Subway before you get to the freeway. If you head north, you can eat at the City Square Deli instead, which also has great sandwiches and great service. Further north, you can find a Jersey Mike's in the plaza along Happy Valley Rd. Literally any of these places will serve you sandwiches of equal or better quality without the unacceptably terrible service.  EDIT: I had a long and busy day and it wasn't until late afternoon until I finally had the time to eat my sandwich. I unwrapped it to find that it was the wrong sandwich. The same person who had not checked the piece of paper next to her to see if I'd actually ordered a cookie had not bothered to check when she put the wrong, unlabeled sandwich in my bag. It would've taken a few seconds to open the wrapping and peek in and rewrap it, but apparently that was too much to ask for. The sandwich I ordered had double meat and avocado added, so I just got swindled out of several bucks. I will certainly never be coming back."}
{"text":"This Port of subs is very good!  I usually get the #1Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese) or the #18 (Roast beef, turkey, provolone) They always do a good job, and the staff is very friendly, seems like alot of them have been there for quite a while!  Only negative is that they don't have fritos........bring back the fritos!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Port of Subs a few times & it's A-OK. I really like that they slice their meats & cheeses to order, but their bread sucks. I stopped by Tuesday after taking my car to emissions (I passed, woohoo!) & got a large (12') #2-ham, turkey & provolone (added roast beef) for my husband & a small (5\") #17-tuna (chose swiss) for myself. I got white bread for both sandwiches plus 2 bags of chips, no drinks since we were meeting up at home. Total for 2 subs (1 w/extra meat) & 2 bags of chips was $15.80, a lil pricey. I'm sure I'll be back if I'm in the area & need a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I see all the negative reviews about the management so I felt like I needed to comment. I went there for the first time a couple weeks ago and I am bummed it took me this long to go! The produce was fresh and the meat was too. The management was SO NICE. I went in w my 3 small kids and had forgotten my wallet in the car. I didn't realize it until they were half way through making my food. I kept apologizing and they were so kind about it. They finished making our food and then pushed it aside so I could run out to grab my wallet. When I came back in the line was long but the manager didn't bat an eye when I came in. She called me up front and let me pay right away. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really good and friendly service. The place was clean and kinda empty probably because of Easter Weekend. I ordered the cheese ( vegetarian ) sandwich. It was fresh and tasty. I would comeback to this location. Subway is so bland and more of a breadwhich- all bread all the time."}
{"text":"My sandwich was delicious, but the service is what ruined it for me. The seemingly gentleman whose name I unfortunately did not get, but his description is light skinned average height male with long brown ponytail brown eyes, somewhat heavy build who speaks unprofessionally to not only customers but his co workers as well. At first his demeanor seemed attentive and then he began to mock his co worker's competence. Followed by him not only making rude remarks to my friend I was accompanied by but also to myself in which he used unwelcomed suggestive body language and words, which he immediately apologized right after for having said because he realized he was in the wrong after having noted the most displeased look on my face. Does not change the fact that it happened, very unprofessional, he also claimed to be \"the boss\", which when I called to inquire about his name, I was informed he was in fact not a boss, or even a manager. Unprofessional. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Prices are great, portions are perfect, and it's fresh! When I spend 5 hours in a cubicle in the early morning watching the guys behind the counter slice the meat never fails to entertain me.   They don't overload on ingredients. The sandwich is simple because the meat is good enough alone. Nice choice in bread, too. And for less than $5 I can definitely make a couple of visits per month."}
{"text":"I love the freshness of this sandwich. The pickles are so yummy! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The app doesn't work. There is food on the app that is not present at the restaurant. When we got to the restaurant to pick up our food, they had accidentally deleted the order. I re-ordered, and ended up being charged twice. The store refused to give me a refund for the second order saying they didn't know how.  Addendum: I called the store the following Monday, the manager, Nick, told me that he was busy with training, and will call me back in a couple minutes. He never did. I called back in the late afternoon, and told him that I needed a refund for the food I never received. He told me that there was nothing he could do. He seemed to be totally apathetic. He said that somebody else would call me back, but never did.  I called the corporate office in Reno, they were helpful. They  were  pleasant and apologetic, and refunded my money."}
{"text":"Do indeed enjoy a good fresh cut sandwich and port of subs is the real deal. I'm a huge fan of the #1 and their brownies right by the register.. it's like an ambush of goodness you didn't know you needed. The extra large is plenty to fill and you'll have enough left over to take home."}
{"text":"My kids favorite!  A bit pricey for a sandwich but good quality product and service has always been positive."}
{"text":"The most dry sandwich I've ever had. The only reason I'm going to eat it is because I paid $9 for it. Asked for a side of mayo to try to make it a little more tolerable and got a dirty look from a dirty looking employee. Parking is extremely tight as well. A V O I D!!!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday and they only had 1 employee due to a sick call. The one employee there named David was on fire. He made and rang up 7 sandwich orders in about 10 minutes making 4 at a time. I was extremely impressed as the girl behind me was. David is an asset!"}
{"text":"Strike 1: Does not pick up their phone promptly. Had to call three different times after the first two calls rang 8+ times while trying to place a pick up order. Strike 2: Either does not understand English well or is hard of hearing. Have to repeat almost half of my orders even after speaking slowly and clearly. Strike 3: Order is not ready by their pick up time, and even then, they didn't even get some orders right  Very sloppy service, sub-par ingredients. I wouldn't have returned if it wasn't for a co-worker who wanted to specifically order from there again, but I ran into the same issues both times."}
{"text":"I give it one star because the meat is fresh sliced. The bread was falling apart, it was so thin. And all the veggies looked old and wilted and the tomato was yellowish. Won't come back"}
{"text":"They will slice the meat and cheese for your sub right when you order. It was good. Reminded me of subway.  I was hoping they would have some type of special sauce or sandwich.    Where they really turn heads is their catering.  The price is better then subway and you don't have to give them a big notice a head of time like subway.  A much better choice when ordering lunch for the office. Even better,  they deliver."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite to eat and I was very happy that I had done so the customer service was great, the food was on point - will be coming back soon to try other items on their Manu."}
{"text":"I really hate coming here but it is so close to work.   The manager can't count. I said double meat on one sandwich and triple on the other. She asked me multiple times. Double meat. Two times the meat. I said yes. She ended up putting FOUR TIMES the meat on one and 6 X meat on the other. I asked what the hell happened because the sandwhiches were giant, and the price was freaking craziness.   She explained \"i asked you if you wanted two times the meat\" i said yes. 2 x 1 is 2, not four. Double means 2. I have no idea why she didn't understand it. It was so ridiculous.   Also, theyre always out of stuff. No chipotle mayo and no lettuce for the lettuce wrap one day. Their response was \"well its the end of the week.\" Ummm so? You are open everyday.   In the 7 months I have gone here. They have only had lettuce for the lettuce wrap ONE time.   They need new management."}
{"text":"I go to port of subs on a daily basis. I finally found one near my school, so I ordered online and went to pick it up. The guy making the sandwiches got my order wrong. The guy ringing the customers up, had no experience and tried to short change me. Was almost late to work because the manager made the poor choice to train during a lunch rush"}
{"text":"Love Port of Subs!!! 4.5 stars except for that damn, west Vegas sun blaring through those windows! I was there at 6:30 p.m. and recieved 2nd degree burns on my calves and neck... Lol.. KIDDING! Jamie and Gabriel are  phenomenal staff!  This store..... Pros: Great staff.. Clean.. Great location.  Cons: West facing windows need tint AND retractable shades.  Your staff is panting Bill!!!! Treat them right, they'll treat you right.  Note: Not one customer seen dining in or near the \"Lava pit!\""}
{"text":"This port of subs is the best!! They are always sweet and considerate!  As soon as we walk into the restaurant they know our order because we go in there much!!!! I am definitely going to keep going to this port of subs!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's just this location but this is the second time I have been here and the bread is stale. We sat down to eat and I found a hair in my sandwich. I said something to the kid behind then counter and he offered to remake it. I just wanted my money back since I hadn't even taken a bite but he said their policy was no refunds. Gross."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Older Chinese lady behind the counter is totally rude and does not understand the beginning of customer service and value building.Will not be back."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted Port of Subs Tuesday night, so I took her there. When I went in I asked to speak to the manager to complain about my last visit. The manager introduces herself and apologized. I felt a bit better about the incident. The sandwhiches and service were wonderful. I want to say thank you to the manager of this store. She was also very kind to my five year old daughter."}
{"text":"Good food, almost always fast, and close to work. I wish it was a little bit cheaper but I can say that about everywhere. #5 on wheat, no olives, add jalapeno. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches, and very clean! They do a great job with catering too! I would definitely reccomend it for your next event. The pricing is good and it definately beats subway. Make a request they generally accommodate when they can. :-)"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times without any issue. I've been a fan of the 2 foot long sandwich deal. Today I want in and ordered a 2 foot long sandwich to go. The person prepping the sandwich skimped on ingredients. They usually load it up, but she only put 5 slices of cheese on the 2 foot long sandwich when she should have put 8. Same for a lot of the meat. Proportionally, there was a lot more bread in my sand which than usual. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I am truly disappointed and appalled with the customer service I received Yesterday, 9/05/14 around 6:45 pm. I love Port of Subs and the fact that this is the closest location to me; however this establishment clearly could care less about their Customer Service. I walked into Port of Subs with my boyfriend after having excellent customer service next door at \"Shall We Play?\" (A Family Board Game Store, which I highly recommend visiting).   When we first walked into Port of Subs, it was as if we were ALREADY doing or asking for too much. There were two young men and a short frumpy girl with glasses working the floor. The girl was nonchalantly posted up against the wall by the young man, serving a Mother and her young daughter. I don't know what rubbed me wrong the most...The fact that they all physically turned their heads to see us walk in without saying Hello (I mean the shop next door was busier than this place and the man running the store was more courteous. He took the time to Welcome and wish everyone who walked in a good day) or the fact that she laughed obnoxiously while she watched us walk in, like we were already wasting our time.   We proceeded to give them the benefit of the doubt, considering it was dead and they close up at 9:00 pm. We made it to the beginning of the line and waited for some sort of acknowledgement that we would be helped soon, but STILL no one spoke to us. The girl was clearly being lazy and had this \"I don't give a shit attitude\" and walked away from the wall as we made it to the beginning of the line. She then literally began doing all her closing duties right in front of us with about TWO HOURS left before closing. I don't know where she learned how to work or who taught her \"Customer Service\" but they need to get rid of the cancer in that store. It's apparent I am not the first to report this girl's attitude and how horrible the shop is ran, which is why I am surprised they are still in business!  Anyway, we proceeded to wait about 15 minutes or so until the young man poked his head into the back and waved the other employee out for some help. \"Finally\" (I thought) but the girl halted him back and flat out said in front of us,   \"No don't worry about it, they can wait. Go, Go! \".   I couldn't believe this girl! She was really making us wait for NO REASON, other than the fact that she didn't want to be there and was too lazy to DO HER JOB.  I have worked in hospitality for years and this has been the worst experience I have had in awhile! When I heard that remark I was disgusted and asked my boyfriend if he was ready to leave, since it was clear they did not want to serve us (for whatever reason). When we turned to leave the store, the girl laughed rudely and said,   \"See!\" as if we fell for her plan.  People like her don't deserve to be employed and it is disappointing to see them take advantage of an opportunity they were GIVEN, clearly she didn't EARN it.  Her job is obviously too hard to handle and people who take advantage of their Employer like this should no longer BE employed! She got everything SHE wanted, but what about the Customers? I couldn't believe she was okay with how she represented herself and this establishment. I guess we should have walked out the minute they \"acted\" like they were too busy to say \"Hi, we will be right with you!\" But as a regular of Port of Subs, I was expecting to be in and out with satisfactory service. I will never waste my business or hard earned money ever again at this Port of Subs location.   To the General Manager of this store, I would advise hiring some hard workers who would appreciate the opportunity of employment and truly benefit your location. That unhappy girl (and I say girl because she clearly is not mature enough to work) needs to go, because that will be your downfall. Definitely won't EVER recommend someone to visit this location, but I will be back to ensure that my review and the previous customer reviews are heard. If that girl is STILL there after all the reviews she ALONE is accumulating, then I  think the only appropriate action would be to contact the Corporate Office as well as the BBB if they can't make this simple change on their own."}
{"text":"I went in to this location last night it was about 20 min before they were closing there were 3 other people in line as well there were 3 employees working and boy did they show how angry they were that there were customers coming in so close to their closing time the older woman that was taking orders and slicing glared at us and said what do you want ? Not can I help you what can I get for you she said what do you want I was a little shocked I have my order as did my husband she slammed down the cheese and made it clear she wasn't happy and that we were all a bother my husband asked to add bacon she threw a clump of bacon in the microwave not a few pieces like usual it was a huge clump like 7 pieces thank you for the extra but he didn't want a bacon sandwich lol she just didn't care and wanted us out , the next guy that puts the toppings on the sandwich was also rushing us as well as wiping his nose on his sleeve ! At last the cashier well she was pleasant enough probably happy we were taking it to go ! Anyway 2 star service don't go in if they are closing soon is the lesson they make it clear your not welcome"}
{"text":"Every weekend my \"go to\" shop for lunch with my family is Port of Subs. I've been to many locations. Although this isn't the closest location to my house it's the one I always come for a nice quick lunch. When I stop in I usually end up seeing Claud, Cheyanne, or Kayla. I'm always pleased to see them. They're the friendliest staff and always take time to see how my family is doing. They got our orders memorized and always know what we get the moment we walk in. They make our food fast and it always turns out fantastic. It's for sure worth the extra ten min drive to come out just to see my favorite sandwich staff. So far I've gotten a lot of my co workers and neighbors to stop in and they share the same experience with awesome Port of Subs workers. Can't wait till I stop in again next week !"}
{"text":"I think the best way to sum it up is that I just don't get their angle.  Depending on what you're shopping for, be it quality, speed, selection, quantity, price, or convenience....why would you go here?  Quality - The subs are better at Albertsons, located in the same building. Speed - When I went there was a single person working on subs, about 5-6 people in line.  The line moved, but again, if speed is a concern, why go here?  The subs are premade next door. Selection - Average for a sub place, freshness was great.  But again, more selection next door and it's just as fresh. Quantity - Here's where they really fall behind.  At their prices, I'd certainly hope that they do more than just a thin layer of ingrendients, but alas, it was a pretty sparse quantity of meat and cheese. Convience - This place is just as convenient location-wise, but has less parking than Albertsons. Price - Spendy.  Out the door you're looking at about $10 for an 8 inch sub combo.  I guess my experience itself wasn't bad...I'll just never be back because I can't justify it in ANY category I can come up with.  Why would you even open up this shop here when you can't compete on any level with the other businesses around?  Within a mile you'll find Subway, Jersey Mike's Quiznos and I'm sure others.  But you don't have to look any further than the grocery store they share a wall with to see them get beat handily."}
{"text":"I always get a #7 on wheat bread with the works, the quality is great every time. The service is on par as well. The store is clean and not really busy (guessing they get more take-out orders).   I've also order thru the phone and it would be ready right when I got there."}
{"text":"I love coming to this Port if Subs. However, tonight one of the employees did not wash their hands after handling money. I don't care if they wear gloves, there is regulations and guidelines for a reason. Again, I love coming to this establishment, they have real Parmesan, NOT in the can.... but please wash you hands after handling cash!"}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs generally, but this Windmill and Pecos stands out as exceptional.  MIGUEL and TONY shine. They are models of customer service excellence and make every one of my visits special.  And they keep a sparkling clean restaurant and sandwich prep line. Thank you for the gracious upbeat service guys!"}
{"text":"Although the smoothies are delicious, they are overpriced. I live in the area and received a coupon in the mail for Smoothie King. I took my son and I there to use the coupon and get smoothies and was told they do not accept coupons that are not Desert Ridge specific. I will now go out of my way to another Smoothie King who wants additional business."}
{"text":"Called today for 2  6ft subs that I needed delivered within 25 minutes and it was 11:10 am when I placed the order. I spoke with Daniel and he was professional and responsive. He worked the order in and delivered to our business around the corner by 11:40 am. Amazing! What a great employee he must be! The crew at our non-profit helping all morning on this Make a Difference Day enjoyed the sandwiches and commented on how fresh and delicious it all was. Daniel even gave us a small platter with pickles, peppers, onion, etc and both mayo and the mayo-mustard spread. I would highly recommend this Port of Subs location and we will certainly use them again!"}
{"text":"Love this place !!!! This is my favorite location to visit. The staff is always very friendly and they are super quick. Store is so clean and food is just awesome."}
{"text":"I would just like to comment on The Ultimate BEST Port of Subs in Las Vegas,  and probably the State of Nevada!!! It starts when you walk through the front door.  You are greeted by the owners,  a lovely couple who have made this restaurant a very awesome place to come and enjoy a relaxing, delicious lunch! You also feel a sense of pride in their business,  because the restaurant is always clean and well organized from the lobby,  to the food line.  It's always stocked and looking deliciously inviting, and very clean and well presented.  They are always smiling and very happy to see you again, and make your order to your specifications.  It's that personal touch, and caring personality that makes me love their restaurant so much!!! I think that the Corporation of Port of Subs should recognize their restaurant for being The Best one on the Planet in every aspect from the front door,  to the back door, including the restrooms!!  It's a 5 star store! So if you want a fabulous atmosphere,  great food, and friendly caring people who are grateful for your business,  then visit Port of Subs on West Flamingo and Jones!! You'll say,  wow! That lady really knew what she was talking about!!!.....Yes I do!"}
{"text":"This place was very cheap with the toppings, the service wasn't very good and it should have been cheaper for the quality. Won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"Worst sandwiches I've ever had all you could taste with salt I'm really disappointed because I bought two sandwiches and they both taste like salt and they get a lot of free attitude at the drive-thru window bitch you should quit and that store should be shut down"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but the difference between the POS in Tempe and my home shops in Reno is something I can taste.   Its still good, but its just not the same as Reno's several shops. I think its the bread.   They also need to work on the speed of service. I know its an art, but need to do that with the quickness."}
{"text":"I was pretty stoked on this place at first. 5 stars worth of happy.  But that's been sliding downward for the past couple of months. Seems like they brought in some new sandwich makers who are either a) incompetent or b) just don't give enough of a shit to do their job right.  Went in today, August 8, 2012 around 1:15. Two guys behind the counter. I order a #12, no cheese, double meat. Not a big deal, right? First thing I notice in this process that I've never seen is that there's a congregation of flies on the meat slicer. Not a huge deal as I've seen a lot worse in Africa, but still, pretty foul really. The slicer had not been cleaned in some time, so you could see meat detritus all over it. Oh well, I thought, I can let this slide.  The guy then slices the regular amount of meat, two rows. I mention to him that I had ordered double meat, he feigns that he didn't hear me, then hands the sandwich over to the second guy in the line, and walks off.  I mention it to the second guy. He says \"Oh that is double meat\" which was bullshit. I am a large mammal, and I've eaten at MANY Port-Of-Subs over the years. Its four rows of meat spark plug. He ignores me.  Then they move on to topping the sandwich. I ask from the onset for extra lettuce, gotta sneak in a serving of veggies any way I can. He opens the lettuce bin, its almost empty and then he tries to short me even the regular amount. I ended up having to ask 4 times to get the proper amount.  Then they charge me, without telling me, for double meat. It didn't dawn on me til I had my credit card back in my hand.  I am normally a huge POS fan, ask my girlfriend who hates this place. However, I think I will save myself some hassle and some BS and go out to Tempe even though this particular franchise is all of 5 minutes from my house.  And if this is being read by anyone who manages that place, I'd really suggest firing everyone working today and starting over again. Your staff are going to kill your business. I'm done with you until someone shows that things have changed. There are a lot of places to get a sandwich in the Valley. You've lost my business."}
{"text":"I used to go here once a week, but recently the last two visits I tried it I got very sick. They fired a few people and clearly standards have gone way down hill because of it. I'd stay clear of this one. Also, don't ever order the meatball sub. It was abysmal."}
{"text":"I have been to the Port of Subs here many times. They offered a slight discount to my company and it was very close by. Still, I was thrilled when other restaurants opened nearby.  The location is hard to beat. It's open and light inside. The drinks are tucked away, but there plenty of room for a quick lunch.  The bread is dry and crummy. The meat is great and is sliced right then and there (is that somehow better?), But the veggies and so-so. It is proceed above Subway, which is perfectly confusing. I've had most things on the menu and all of them are more or less mediocre. I'm not a Subway fanatic but it's a better sandwich place than PoS by direct comparison.  Still the service is good, the staff is kind, and the sandwich es fill you up. But with nasty bread and veggies, no amount of recently sliced meat is going to save you from a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Been at various establishments for lunch. I keep returning here. There's always consistency with customer service and quality."}
{"text":"I like this place because of their thin bread and their variety of drinks their customer service was fantastic I like the store too wow port of subs had fresh brownies"}
{"text":"Great food ordered the 2 foot number and shared it was perfect and this location has lunch specials, staff was nice the place was clean."}
{"text":"So happy to have a closer Port of Subs to mts. Edge. I've been a few times and I am very happy with the food, the service, and it's cleanliness.."}
{"text":"This place was the worst the girl with colored hair obvious doesn't like her job poor customer service I'll never eat here again"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! this is my favorite location to visit. The staff is always very friendly and they're super quick. Store is so clean and food is just awesome. My stomach is now complete. I live so close so it's convenient. But I'd drive past other sandwich shops, just to grub here."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the busy parking lot in would definitely be in more often! Parking really is not their fault and Crystal makes up for that! So friendly and helpful! Will be in more often."}
{"text":"I love how i don't have to wait long for someone to come out of the back to help me. the veggies are always fresh and look amazing. the quality of their meat is astounding (: the people are always smiling and they're super nice. i cannot get enough of this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! I first went with my family for a 2 foot sub for $10.99! How awesome is that! With a couple of sides it was more than enough to feed our family of four!  We got our ham, turkey, and smokey cheddar on sourdough! I love how they slice everything right in front of you. So fresh and yummy!  The sourdough bread has a bit of a chewiness which is just awesome! So much better than the spongy, squishy bread at other places!  Then I came back the following week with some friends on my lunch. I was a little worried since it was a bit crowded and I only had so much time to get back to the office. It wasn't a problem at all. The staff there is excellent at getting you in and out quickly, maintaining the food quality, and still making you feel like a valued customer.  Someone who was there both times I went (I am guessing maybe he is the owner or manager), recognized me and gave me a card for return customers. Since he remembered I had just been there, he gave me credit for 3 sandwiches. How nice is that? :-)  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. She made my sub and I had to wait 15 minutes for payment . As she is making subs for other customers. I think she doesn't want to take her gloves but making customers wait is horrible. This is the worst customer experience. Please add your staff. I am never going there again."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for $1 off a combo meal. Order my food and go to pay. Guy at register rings up chips and drink separately, then takes the $1 off. Explain to him that he is supposed to take the $1 off the combo price of $8.99. He says if he did that. I would be getting a \"double discount.\" I have been going here for years and this is the first time this has happened. They have lost a loyal customer and I will discourage anyone from coming here."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place I've been too in a while nice and clean   a lady named cheesy made my food and keep a smile on my face from the time i came in and left i asked her was she new she said no she just loves her job in love helping customers i thought she was the a very good employee thanks so much i will be a regular for now on keep up the good work hunny"}
{"text":"Solid fast food deli. Friendly staff. Sometime skimp on the amount of meat they slice for a sandwich. Like that the bread they use is not extremely thick like Subway's, where unless you double the meats you can't taste anything but bread. Always clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"Place gets pretty busy during lunch time, but they make a very good sub. Only sub place I would recommend in the general area."}
{"text":"The mgr there is very rude when I placed a order.on Saturday 10-17  Her attitude wAs bad asked her what her name was in mean voice why. ((Anna). And then she lol at me making me feel like I'm stupid.  I asked for a bLT on white mayo only she mayo mustard told her I didn't want that she scraped. It off really put burnt bacon on my sandwich it was horrible. During this whole time she looks at like  ur the stupid one. Makes u feel uncomfortable. Dnt understand how she is even a mgr.  Ok a young girl comes from bathroom which we all wash hands there I hope we'll she started to make my sandwich hello. U just walked  into a food prep area rewash ur hands. Did she NO when I Asked her. To wash hands they both lol. Anna shaking. Her head good Management. Smh. Tables were dirty music. Was a lil loud. Had to talk over it.  Better believe I will not be visiting while they r working.  Not to include I will also be calling corporate. Reading reviews. Nthg is done about attitudes. At this restaurant. And maybe. They Dnt even know how this store is being ran.  Well no stars but obviously  I have to give a one star"}
{"text":"I WANT to like Port of Subs because they are conveniently located.  I have been there 4 times now and all I can say is YUCK!  I wish I had a Subway nearby."}
{"text":"For Desert Ridge I would suggest another place. The staff i s not very friendly and frankly it seems they would rather be smoking in front of the store, as they often are. The restaurant isn't very clean, either, so I didn't feel good about eating there.  There are better options close by.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...been here before and it was fine but I just went and all the toppings were dried iPhone and shrivelled.   The lettuce was brown .  I had to cancel and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was planning to go to Sam's famous subs across the street. Sam's has 14 reviews for a total of 4 and a half stars. Sam's was closed so I went to Port of Subs.   Honestly, I don't see the point of this place. The world has enough Jimmy John's and Subway style places. Port of Subs claim to fame is freshly sliced meat and a mix of mayo and mustard.   While the food is good, it's nothing to write home about and I would never go back. If I knew it was so boring I would have went elsewhere in the first place."}
{"text":"I'll keep this as short as possible. Came here for a couple sandwiches on a Saturday evening. There were two workers, a guy and a girl. The guy was talking to himself while making the sandwiches. The girl came from out of the back to help. My order could not be completed as requested as the guy said they only had two slices of American cheese. He put the two slices back from where he took them after putting them on the sandwich.  As the girl was putting lettuce on the sandwiches she must have put 3 full cups on each. The guy and her were having an extremely difficult time making and finishing these sandwiches. We were the only 2 customers in the building. I finally had to ask the guy if the two of them were baked or on drugs. He got defensive and hostile, but it seemed that he was expecting it.   Finally, upon checking out I told the girl I wanted the receipt. She made a motion as if she had put it in the bag, then switched it to her other hand and put it on the left side of the register. I looked in the bag when I picked it up and said I don't see a receipt in here. She proceeded to frantically do a reprint of the receipt. It did not have the cashier name or proof that the transaction was paid by our credit card. I assume that this fiasco was an attempt to keep us from complaining. I would have let it go and left it as an amusing side show had the girl not tried to dupe me with the receipt.  In addition, it did not look like the containers were labeled and dated for freshness. The two did not know how old the avocado slices were. The guy was conversing with the girl, blaming it on the morning/afternoon employee and said if the avocados were still there in the morning then toss them. How health code and sanitary savvy. We didn't eat the sandwich with avocados. Went to the trash. The guy also made a comment to the girl about the things he had left to do in the back and said something about getting some me or happy time with a hand gesture.  I don't think I need to elaborate any further on that because it was pretty easy to infer what was going on.    Message to the owner; I don't care what your employees are doing on the clock if it does not pose a health risk to me, but you should care deeply how they represent your establishment and company good will.   Here is the receipt info so that in the event you do not know what is going on in your establishment and would like to keep your clientele you can address these two fine model employees:  Port of subs 92 2642 horizon 702 914 8288 Ticket #136 IN Ammount $15.06  Payment: charge 6455 20:25 #01 AUG.30'14 REG0001"}
{"text":"A great choice when you are tired of subway.  They slice the meat and cheese to order and the result is a really fresh sandwich.  Really like that they offer a 5\" size, it is perfect for lunch. Also, the mayo/mustard mix is really tasty."}
{"text":"Just repaired the back door at this place and it smelled so good it was making me hungry. so after i finished the job i got myself some lunch. ordered a number 5 with lettuce, honey mustard, and mayo. basic sandwiches are my thing so its hard to go wrong but the ingredients are top notch here. the manager orders all his produce daily, unlike subway which is every seek i think. the lettuce here is great, im really picky about shredded lettuce since i hate the rine and dark green. meats and cheeses are sliced on a meat slicer right on the spot to your liking. whats more to say.  sanwiches are sized, 4, 6, 8, and 12 inches. they also have a great catering menu with meaT and cheese trays and salad kits. considering having them cater my daughters birthday in may.  havent stopped by any other of the shops across the valley but so far i like the food. service was quick. there were 3 people working plus the manager for the lunch rush at 12. i was in and out quickly. they have coke products and a tea fountain with four different teas available. place is clean front and back.  recomended over subway any day."}
{"text":"This was a first time trip for me to Port Of Subs. The people were friendly, my sandwich was great and reasonably priced. I definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop I've always loved it, the meats and cheese are sliced fresh and the bread is delicious. The employees are super nice and always remember repeat customers so be nice and leave a couple bucks in the tip jar!!! Are there some patrons that go who can sometimes be annoying?, yes that's anywhere, one cannot dock points for your surroundings it's a public place after all. Much love for Port of Subs!!   :-)"}
{"text":"Always a great sandwich at this location. Seems like a high turnover on employees but the service never suffers. Wonderful rewards card program. Seems like I'm earning free sandwiches all the time. One of my old reliable eateries. If I had any complaints it would be the cleanliness of the tables, those could use some attention. Normally I take out but it was hard not to notice today."}
{"text":"I've visited this location several times in the evenings on my way home from work. Every time I go in after 6pm, they are all set to close even though they are open until 8. Drives me crazy that they have the mop out and chairs already up on the tables. Last time I went in at 6:30pm I commented on how they must really not want anyone to stay. This sends the wrong message to customers and makes me feel like they don't want my business. Who puts chairs up for pre-closing during a dinner rush?! I wish there was a closer location to my house because this one is always a let down."}
{"text":"I always come here during the lunch time and they are very fast and effiecient with getting everyone out in just a few minutes which is impressive because this place gets busy!! This is my first time coming here at night and I appreciate how the staff makes conversation. The place is always clean and if you ever need a table re-wiped they gladly do it even during the busy rush.  The number 1 is really good. I am in love with their giant cookies!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. For all you sub sandwich fans you need to check this place out if you haven't already. You don't leave smelling like cheese(subway) and they slice all the meat and cheese fresh when you order it. It is a little more pricey than Subway, about 9 bucks for 8 inch sub, but hey you get what you pay for.   Can get really busy around lunch time with all the industrial areas around. The staff is friendly will move you through the line pretty quickly though. Having 2 different lines where people can order their subs helps."}
{"text":"I went to Port of Subs for breakfast thinking it would be a good meal. First of all, their eggs are heavily manufactured. They put their \"yoke\" in a microwave and surprisingly something that looks like eggs came out. They barely put any lettuce on my sandwich  and the cheddar cheese didn't taste too much like cheddar. The service wasn't all that great either."}
{"text":"Whenever I come in here Miguel and Tony are always up beat and have an envious amount of energy.  I have only been to this port of subs but these guys do such a good job I refuse to go to Jimmy Johns or Subway where the workers seem depressed with no energy.  These guys at least try and make an effort to make you smile and enjoy your visit.   Would recommend if you're in the mood for a fresh sub or my favorite  a roast beef and provolone wrap with mustard mayo mix, avacados peppercinis lettuce tomatoes and the good stuff.  Never let me down."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this chain as I was visiting from out of town and it was awesome. Really good sub. Service was fast and friendly and very polite. I had the number 5 on wheat. The medium is the perfect size for me. The lady at the counter explained to me that they are mostly based in the West. I will definitely look for more of these as I travel in the west area."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches for lunch. I only get a 30 minute lunch and there are only a handful of sandwich places by my office:   Subway  Quiznos  Port of Subs  these are the three \"chains\"   My first job was at a Togo's in California. Now that was a sandwich! Since moving to Las Vegas I have tried so hard to find another place that makes them like Togo's. There are some contenders, but nothing identical.   Port of Subs in my opinion has a much better product than Subway or Quiznos, and while it is no Togo's, it satisfies my Togo's craving until I can get back to California.   I stick with the basics, Turkey and Provolone on Wheat. Make sure you ask for extra veggies! Seems across the board sandwich shops in general have been skimping on the veggies.   This particular POS location is friendly and fast, and that is important on a quick lunch break. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the manners of the employees here. Very unhelpful and simply rude. I took in a coupon sheet and it was like I was being reprimanded for bringing it. Another person came in after me and ordered something that I had an extra coupon for and I wanted to give it to them.  I was yelled at by the employees and told that they could not use it since I had one that I was going to use."}
{"text":"Picked up some Port-O yesterday and ordered my usual #5 smoked turkey, ham and cheese.  The bread unfortunately was a little stale and they barely put any meat on it.  I never really had any issues when I've been to other locations.  Anyways, I ordered the combo with chips and a drink.  The soda machine is like this crazy handy dandy futuristic machine that looks like it would be able to grab the cup out of your hand, fill it up and say thank you have a nice day.  Pretty cool.  With three people working, the customer service lacked a little bit of friendly but hey all I want is a sandwich and go -not any big conversations anyway."}
{"text":"When I was 15 I got my first job at a California based sandwich shop. Since moving to LV I have never really been satisfied with sandwich shop options because they didn't match up to my CA favorite. I do believe I can say Port of Subs comes pretty damn close.  Their prices are very reasonable. The food is fresh and consistent and they slice the meat to order.  This location has a great staff. They are busy at lunch because of the offices around the neighborhood. You can expect to wait from noon till about 1:30, however the line moves quick. I appreciate that they have everyone manning a station and everyone knows their responsibilities so there isn't a delay.   My favorite is #8 - Turkey and Provolone or #18 - Turkey, Roast Beef and Provolone.   You can order online also. If you have a big order, place it online :)  I'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Can not believe this place.  I am literately .2 miles out of \"delivery range\".  This store calls me 45 minutes after placing the order to tell me they aren't going to deliver to me.  You guys should really check out Desert Inn and McCloud location.  They delivered to us and it was way better then the sandwiches that we had ever received at the Charleston location.  This franchise location leaves a bad taste in the mouth for other Port of Sub locations.  Corporate has been made aware of the issues I have with this location."}
{"text":"I used to eat here regularly for years then new owners took over and I heard they were not good and stingy with the extras so did not go back. But a few months ago I decided I just wanted a sub really bad and they are just around the corner from me so gave it a try again. First time we had a little communication problem because I want my sub just so and they wanted to go fast. I was the only 1 in there at that time so asked them to slow down. Today was the 3rd time in the past 2 months I went and everything went great. Many tables full and the help is excellent and so courteous. The place is spotless. Best Sub I had had in a long time. Think they just needed to adjust and slow down and listen to what customer wants. Fast is not always great. All extras fresh and plentiful. Love when they always have jalapenos."}
{"text":"Um.... My sandwich tasted like bread. I couldn't taste the meat or cheese at all. Is it the quality of meats they use or what? It was bland to me. It was completely empty when my husband, daughter and I went in so you figure the workers would be excited they had something to do? No. The meat cutter girl didn't even smile once at us and I got the impression she hates her job. The register girl was very nice though!  I dont see myself returning ever."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs!  Whenever I'm in Nevada I have to swing by for a sandwich.  This is a good clean operation and they make a good #1 sandwich which is the italian sub with all the right meats and toppings.  Good friendly staff and pretty easy to find."}
{"text":"I thought this store had gotten their act together but today was the last straw. The Hispanic guy with the ponytail was ringing me and thought it was okay for him to comment on my eyebrows. Telling me one of them is perfect while the other is really uneven. Who says that to a customer? I can't believe how rude he was. Not to mention he said the girl that was in there before me had the most f*cked up eyebrows he'd ever seen. I can't imagine the other things he said to people. So disgusted"}
{"text":"It's been over a year since i have been here. Everything was decent the food was fresh.  The employees were very friendly and it was kept clean inside. Will most likely be back in soon."}
{"text":"This location is run by a nice older Asian couple. They are friendly enough and the store is clean enough. I come here because it is convenient.   I have noticed that the sandwiches they make are skimpier than other Port of Subs locations. They put exactly two small napkins in your bag. (There are no napkin dispensers out for customers to take them like other places.) If you ask for more, they yell at you. The attitude they have is one of \"cheap\" instead of \"pleasing\".  They also do not take corporate coupons."}
{"text":"Had roast beef and the chili.  Both were very good.  Even though it seemed like the manager was having a bad day, he was still very courteous and thanked me for stopping in.  I recommend!"}
{"text":"Convenient location is about the only thing I liked about this place. Needed food after work and this was the first thing I saw. First thing is that 2 hours before closing their open sign was turned off so I had no idea they were actually open until I walked up to the door to look at the hours. When I went to order the slicers were so dirty and looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while. The two employees that were working were so annoyed it was a little shocking. They were very short and rude and could tell they didn't want to be there let alone help customers. Won't be returning although the food was pretty good"}
{"text":"Good for the price. One of the people I ate here with said he didn't get much meat on his sub, but I personally felt mine was just fine, so I presume this varies from person to person or by order. I thought my sandwich was pretty delicious all things considering, could certainly be better, could certainly be worse. If you want something different for lunch or dinner, i recommend trying this place at least once."}
{"text":"Came upon this place because of yelp and really enjoyed it.  Great sandwiches. Had the Sweet Chili Chicken sandwich which was tasty. Family had the #5 with bacon that was really good too.  Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this location!  Mike, the owner, worked with me on a big school order.  Very professional and helpful!  My 5 sandwich trays were ready to go at the scheduled pick up time.  The presentation was great and the teachers LOVED them! That mustard/mayo mix is so good, as is the fresh produce they use and the delicious bread as well!  Great value, great taste.  Somerset Sky Pointe Academy teachers and staff really enjoyed their lunch. Thank You, Mike!!"}
{"text":"Summary of my experience: 1). Don't expect to 'get in and get out' quickly. Since they cut all the meat as you order your sandwich it slows down the process. If you're not in a hurry, it's no problem. If you're trying to get out fast, you will be frustrated.  2). Sandwiches are pretty good and pretty consistent on quality. A few times they have skimped on the veggies, but in general things have been solid.  3). I believe prices are a bit on the high side, especially when you add anything like chips/drinks.  Without a coupon, I would likely will go elsewhere.  4). I enjoy the Coke 'Freestyle' soda machine (push button where you can select from dozens of soda choices).  No complaints about the food. Speed could get better, and regular prices are a bit too high for this type of restaurant. The sandwich business is tough with a lot of competition. Port of Subs is solid player in a very crowded marketplace, although I'd love to see them differentiate themselves somehow."}
{"text":"I had never been to Port of Subs before but it's really good. They serve big sandwiches with fresh and good quality ingredients. Their subs are a bit pricey though, so I wait until they have deals on their subs for a small discount. It's a nice convenient location"}
{"text":"I can't think of one thing wrong with this place. Recently updated looks awesome. Owner is usually there which makes everything go smooth. Staff is always welcoming and smiling. Can get busy especially during lunch hour. Please order online and skip the line. And food is delicious. If you are a subway fan please make sure you try it at least once you won't regret it because they cut the meat and cheeses right in front of you not like other sandwich places. I just love it !!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a waste of time and money. There subs was way below avg."}
{"text":"I would give a negative rating, if allowed. This location used to be just as good as others, but it has fallen apart in the last few months about the time the employees stopped wearing name tags (which I always find is a bad sign). Several months ago I went in on a Sunday. I ordered a medium #5 with no cheese which has both turkey and ham on it. Between the 2 meats, the server only put 5 slices of meat on the sandwich. When I complained I was told that the sandwich was made to corporate standards and if I wanted more meat I would have to pay for it. A medium is an 8\" sandwich, so he basically had putt he slices flat end to end to cover the bread. There was another employee there, so I complained again and was told the same thing. Then I was told there was nothing I could do about it. So I said yes there is, and I walked out.  I didn't go back for a long time. Then I stopped in during lunch on a weekday and had no problems at all. So when I wanted a sandwich yesterday it didn't cross my mind that there would be a problem again. Boy was I wrong. On Sat, 9/10 at about 1pm, I entered this store which looked deserted. There was music blaring from the back room which had no business being playing in a family establishment. I can't imagine walking in there with small children to that kind of music. Someone poked their head out to say they would be right there and ran into the back again. So I waited and the music finally stopped. Then another guy comes out of the back and asks me what I want, while putting on gloves without washing his hands. So I said \"I would like a med #1 on white and a med #5 on wheat with no cheese\". He responds by saying \"Ok that's 2 sandwiches on white\". I said, \"That's not what I said at all. One is white and one is wheat.\" He says, \"Well first I need to know what size they are before I can help you.\" So I said \"I already told you the sizes of the sandwiches. I was very detailed when I placed my order.\" At that point I was told that he can refuse service to anyone he wants, whenever he wants, and he doesn't like my attitude so he won't be serving me. My mouth hit the floor!!! You are the one not doing your job properly, but you are going to refuse to serve me? I decided not to say what I was really thinking, but I walked to the door and told him that this was the second time I had been treated poorly at this location. His response was to tell me that I was 86\"d!!! And to tell me he doesn't have to take this abuse from me. ??? The reality is that the order would probably have been a disaster if this ridiculous altercation hadn't happened.  I went down the street to Jersey Mikes, where I was treated like a valued customer, not an intrusion to their private party. Also something to note, this store was deserted during lunch hour on a beautiful Saturday, but the Mike's location had several tables full and lots of people in line.  So I am now infamous for being 86'd by a teenager from a Port of Subs because he couldn't figure out my order. He probably just did me a huge favor. Trust me - stay away from this location."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late dinner and even though it was a short interaction, it was a pleasant one. We had the pleasure of having our sandwiches made by Shomar (who is new) and he did a great job at giving us a generous amount of each condiment, when usually we get a stingy amount at other locations. Even though he's only been working there for a week he did a great job at thoroughly asking if we wanted all the items and if he didn't know the answer to a question he got assistance rather than just blatantly saying \"I don't know\" (which we've gotten from other new people at different locations). Chad the assistant manager rang us up and was pleasant to talk to; he made our experience even better by giving us a discount when they weren't able to toast our sandwiches. Overall we had a great experience and this is now our port of subs of choice!"}
{"text":"Worst Port of Subs in the Las Vegas Valley!! Horrible Staff, rude, and can't handle an order of three sandwich, will go out of my way to find a different Port of Subs!! I've been here three times in the last two weeks and it's been the same horrible experience every time! They made a mistake on my online order and made me feel like it was my fault! I'm all about supporting my neighboring business but this is no longer one of them."}
{"text":"So I have come to this location numerous times and get a medium number 5 with double meat. Now in the past this sandwich is more than the meal and the reason I continue to frequent this location. Today however upon ordering my medium number 5 with double meat I watched as they made my sandwich. As I did I had to question whether or not this was in fact a number 5 with double meat. The double meat was 4 thinly sliced pieces of ham and 4 1/2ish thinly sliced pieces of Turkey. I reminded them that it was double meat and they told me it was. So for additional $2.25 I got what is normally a standard sandwich despite ordering it with double meat and paying the extra price. This sandwich was hardly that of what I used to get here and I'm very disappointed. For a bill of over $18 for two sandwiches aside and drink this is not what I've come to expect and thus the two star rating."}
{"text":"I never had Port of Subs until I moved to the Vegas area, and it's been the best place to satisfy my craving for a good ol' American sandwich. After having their sandwiches and then trying Subway, I would never go back to Subway again. Subway's bread is dry and breaks into pieces easily. Port of Subs' bread doesn't do that and tastes fresher. The bread is very important in a sandwich and if it's not good, the whole sandwich is ruined. Although the sandwiches taste consistently the same no matter what Port of Subs you go to, I'm giving this one a high rating because of the owner. He is always there with a smile and provides excellent customer service. That makes his shop stand out from the others that I've been to. So along with the delicious #1 that I usually get and a very attentive and polite owner that really seems to love his job and care about his customers, I'll be back many times as long as I live here."}
{"text":"LOVEEEE!!! This location is amazing every time and everyone is sooo nice, thank you and keep it up!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! The service was great and as always the sandwich was amazing!! You are the bomb port of subs!!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Since changing ownership, the customer service has improved tenfold. Alfredo has gone above and beyond several times to ensure lunch delivery and making orders right! Such an improvement! Incredible customer service. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best Port of Subs I've ever been to. Their customer service is outstanding. I can't say this enough, I will continue coming here and telling my friends to come here. They have great food, great staff, and a wonderful atmosphere. Thumbs up, thumbs up, thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite a few years. I've never had an issue. Their store is constantly clean. They are always very polite and professional and they are quick at making your lunch.  Pretti in particular was very kind and sweet to me and I appreciate her professionalism.  I will recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches! The owner is a very nice guy. He smiles, welcomes and thanks you everytime you go to his store. Those traits are lost on a lot of businesses these days. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Today was the first I tried this place. What can I say, I like this sub place. I were to compare subway or port of sub, hands down on this spot. Roast beef was sliced to order instead of picking from the bucket. That's what I wanna see. Portion was just right. I split it up with my wife. This sub was 8 inches in total. You get what you paid for. It was really good tho. I would go back to this place. It's healthy as subway."}
{"text":"I have loved Port of Subs since moving here in the 90s but the latest price increase is absolutely absurd. Sadly I won't be coming back often anymore.   Please let me know if it goes back down. Why spend $9 on a medium sub & drink when there's all-you-can-eat sushi for $20 next-door?"}
{"text":"The Sandwiches my husband and I ordered were delicious. I had a #1 and he had a tuna on sour dough doctored up with pickles and cheese and lots of fresh goodies.  We had the combo meals that come with chips and a drink.  Price is very reasonable and in no way compares with Subway.  I call Subway a lettuce sandwich because you can never find the meat on them.  Port of Subs would have gotten a 5 but there was only one employee working when we came in at 11:35.   The guy was doing a great job, but it was lunch time and a line of about 6-7 people formed.  I saw 3 people come in, look at the line and leave.  That is poor management.  I'll be back to try other sandwiches on the menu and enjoy the fresh baked bread."}
{"text":"If you like salad on a bun but prefer to pay for meat then this is the location for you.  I should have walked out when she put the sliver of meat on the slicer, but I thought she'd add a slice.  I was wrong.  Came back because it is close to work.  No more."}
{"text":"I'm new to yelp and new to the area but have been eating out alot do to just moving.  I just wanted to say that i felt it nessary to write about my experience in this specific sandwich shop. (as i love sandwiches) I have been to several of the Port of Subs locations around town and never have i had the experience i received at this location. The employees were very helpful with nutritional information and great knowledge of what to substitute certian ingredients to make it fit my dietary needs.  Both girls were friendly upbeat and seemed to enjoy their jobs. (which doesn't happen alot in fast food especially on a monday during lunch) The only thing I wish Port of Subs had was more variety of breads."}
{"text":"Came here 15 minutes before closing and doors are locked. Kinda disappointed that I drove here and can't even get food."}
{"text":"Very polite people on that only it was great to see. As to the food I haven't been to a Port of Subs since 1996 , and now I remember why the food has little taste, the bread being the foundation to a great sandwich was smashed to paper thin, the meat was not of high quality and is sad all around"}
{"text":"Usually I love this place but today I was just disgusted. Normally I would have reviewed at least 4-5 stars but as of now they deserve 1-barely.  I went in today and got my usual, veggie sub. I don't eat meat so I asked her kindly to wipe down the slicer so it wouldn't have pieces of meat when she cuts my cheese. She wiped it down (barely) but said she wiped it down right before I came in which I don't believe because it was COVERED in meat remnants.   The topping bar was disgusting today. A lot of cross contamination happening which isn't rare when it comes to fast food but obviously they didn't care to clean it up.  Lastly I got my drink at the fountain, and right before I put my lid on my cup I noticed something black on a piece of ice. I took the ice out to inspect it and it was a big chunk of mold. I would post a picture of it but right when I was it I was disgusted and just dumped my drink and threw the cup away. The ice machine is supposed to be cleaned because mold can build up. This is sickening and can legitimately get people sick. Be aware if you are reading this that odds are they haven't cleaned their ice machine in a long ass time. Sorry port of subs, I used to love you especially this location but I call it quits."}
{"text":"Asked for a sandwich without cheese due to allergies. After eating half of it I realized there was cheese. As I start to panic I bring it to the attention of the manager. He asked if I wanted a new sandwich. I reply no, I'm really upset, I'm allergic. His responds, oh okay have a really nice day. What the heck??? A nice day of being sick!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say out of all the port a subs this one is my LEAST favorite ! They do NOT take pride in the actual sandwich it's self. They basically throw it together and that's it. The bread is cut messed up EVERY TIME. I learned how to cut bagels perfectly when I was younger working in a bagel shop. If you hold the bread a certain way it can be cut perfectly.  Who wants fat bread on one side and or holey on the next. Plus the meat should fold over instead of hanging off the sides. It's not rocket science. Just needs a pride taken when making your sandwich."}
{"text":"Good sandwich and a few who are training today and that's fine. I've been new at a job too. But I didn't like it when the manger gal bit my head off for ordering improperly."}
{"text":"Drove all the way right now because it says open until 9pm. Got here to find out they close at 8pm. Very upset, waste of time. Please correct your hours!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people think that just because a sandwich place slices your meat for you that it automatically makes it more fresh and delicious. I highly disagree. Is it a nice touch for a restaurant to cut the meat and cheese fresh, sure I guess. What does this mean for you though? Sometimes less meat/cheese as well as a longer wait in line. I'm not saying I hope the sandwich places I like cut everything a week in advance, I would hope that they just prep in the morning. This sub shop is beyond mediocre. I have eaten here two or three times and it's only because it is so close to work and I didn't have enough time to make it to a better place. Not to rip on these guys but money is money...I like to spend mine where I actually really enjoy the food and it's a treat for me to eat there. I don't get that from here. This is on the same level as Cousins for me...they're both food if you're hungry but they are lower grade sandwiches for the same price as really delicious ones."}
{"text":"Great sub sandwiches! Simple & fresh. I normally get the cold subs here which haven't disappointed me.  Super tasty! I've actually used them once to cater a birthday party as well.  Easy breezy!! Just called in a couple days in advance for the sandwich platters & picked them up on the day of the party.  ALL FRESHLY MADE! No problems.  I would definitely use them to cater again."}
{"text":"I always visited this location with my family, Gary always look after my kids, even though  we don't buy kids meal but he always give cookies and drinks  to my kids. Great customer service."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the customer service was terrible. I felt unwelcomed and awkard, like I was intuding on something. And it reeked of bleach. I couldn't finish eating because the bleach was too strong. I am not visiting it again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not one to say anything negative about Port of Subs,,  have been a customer at various locations for years,, based on what part of town I happen to be working in on any given day,,, but when an employee (Pedro?) attempts to belittle me in regards to what I prefer on my sandwich and what the \"board\" states,,, I'll take my $$$$ to Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying the employees have great customer service  very personable and funny. The employees are what made me want to come back. I normally not in this area and don't visit this restaurant often the last time I was here they had no provolone cheese  this time no regular Doritos. I hope they can get their ordering correct cause I would give them a higher mark"}
{"text":"Stop by for quick dinner.. was very happy.. excellent sub.. generous on everything. . Unlike other port of subs I've been to.. staff very friendly. . A bit small place but a lot of out door seating. . . This place looks very new.. I recommend. ... I got the large roast beef.."}
{"text":"Great place to go to grab a nice and hearty lunch. The workers are usually really friendly and are eager to get the line moving. The bread is almost always delicious and they have a great selection of meats. I haven't tried any of the grilled stuff there, but they look good. The soda machine is also well worth the cost of a drink. The Coke Zero is always good and tastes delicious. The Coke is good too. It can get really busy on Tuesdays and Thursdays around lunch, that's the busiest time on campus which is about...40 feet from their front door, so be warned!"}
{"text":"Love my Port Of Subs.  They make a great sandwich.  The food is always fresh. The staff are very welcome link and warming and they know how I like my sandwich ,"}
{"text":"I used to come to this port of subs frequently. It's close to my apartment and the service was usually pretty quick. Most of the staff was usually very friendly and helpful. Obviously it's not the greatest sub I've ever had, but it wasn't awful and I never left feeling hungry. I went in last week to get a sub to take to work for my lunch break and I had to turn around and walk right out. I witnessed an employee mopping an area in the dining room with gloves on, go behind the counter where they are making food to grab a caution: wet floor sign. He placed the sign where he had moped (gloves still on at this point) and walked right back behind the counter and started making sandwiches with the same gloves on. Are you kidding me?!?! That is absolutely disgusting. I've always questioned the cleanliness of this place but it didn't really bother me until I witnessed that incident. I won't be back."}
{"text":"They say there is nothing new under the sun.  Considering we have lots and lots of sun here in Phoenix, and even more sub shops than days of sunshine, what's one more sub restaurant?  Well, I have to say that Port of Subs does it best.  They don't waste their time with cute and gimmicky bread flavors.  They only have white, wheat, and sourdough.  And this is real bread, with some texture and flavor, not some lifeless excuse for generic Wonder Bread.  And you can get a 2 foot sub here, which I can have split up for the whole family.  Their staff is so friendly here, that they will cut it into as many slices as you want, which is great for my kids.  The manager at this location is particularly good.  He goes the extra mile to make sure you get your food how you want it, and he makes you feel welcome from the beginning to the end of your experience.  So you ask, \"big deal, they have a 2 foot sub here - what really makes them different?\"  All meats and cheeses are sliced to order so you know where it comes from and it's not sitting there drying, oxidizing, and degrading all day while sitting out.  This is a huge difference from other places.  The other huge difference is that their bags of chips are bigger, and their standard drink sizes are bigger than any other sandwich place, not to mention the variety of drinks and chips are superior."}
{"text":"Brian made me a ham and cheese and it had more lattice then ham,  it was the worst sandwich I've ever had.  I will not ever go back to this Port of Subs, I gave him a call and he said there was nothing he can do about it!!"}
{"text":"The food at all Port of Sub locations is consistently average or slightly below.  However, I have to give this location four stars because of the great people that work there.  Every time I leave in a better mood then when I walk in.  They are hard workers and are always cheerful and upbeat, especially the gentleman with a mustache."}
{"text":"Have had lunch here a few times. Always fresh. The staff always welcoming. We used the catering service for a lunch at our office. The prices are incredible. The food was delicious. The delivery was right on time. We will definitely use this catering again for our office. The entire staff loved it."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Dependable & consistent. I've been coming here for almost a year and they're great at being quick and courteous.   They also have an honest wait staff - I accidentally overpaid for an item and the cashier recognized it about 5 minutes later and came to my table to give me the $2 overpayment."}
{"text":"#1 with everything on it minus the black olives has been my favorite sandwich for going on a decade now."}
{"text":"Lousy service.  We placed an order for delivery online at which time it stated delivery would be in 1 hour 10 minutes if delivery time would be late they would call to notify.  At 1 hour 30 minutes with no delivery or phone call we called them only to be told our order had been ready for some time but they were waiting on their outside delivery service to come pick it up. We canceled our order.  They did not care to call us to inform us there would be a delay nor do they disclose they are using an outside delivery service that is unreliable.  I can not recommend this location based on poor management and customer service."}
{"text":"Port of subs is my favorite sandwich shop, I still frequent it, even with all the new sandwich places opening up around campus. The staff is super friendly and the food is anyways fresh. I recommend the number 8, their Turkey is unbeatable! If you haven't tried it, you should, its most certainly the highest quality and quickness!"}
{"text":"Port of Subs has very good sandwiches. This location is open until 2am and it's located within the Shell gasoline station. The sandwich preparer was very polite and generous with the sandwiches' fillings. This is a good place to grab a sandwich in the late hours."}
{"text":"Wow the best Port of Subs I've been to thus far. Not too much into making reviews about chain eateries but the guys who were here working the evening shift were so nice and welcoming! Makes me want to come back to this location! Taking pride in your work and showing it is what most places are lacking!! They are a prime example of how customer service should be! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Went here today, I ordered TWO subs, they screwed up  4 times, so i walked out.  How do you screw up when you make it as i stand right there?  In your quest for speed, you get the orders wrong, slow your happy asses down and get the order CORRECT, thats not asking too much......"}
{"text":"I'm here on business and after working late just wanted an easy dinner to take back to my hotel. I saw this place on Yelp and since the reviews were good decided to check it out. Upon first walking in and within minutes I wanted to politely leave. Peter began helping me by describing the different sandwiches available and also the quality of the food. But I had a long day and was feeling boarder line cranky and picky. Luckily someone else walked in and out in an order. I saw Peter make the sandwich and found myself salivating. Peter and James were very nice and helpful. The sand which was delicious and I tore it up. The ingredients were fresh too! Thanks Peter!! Hope to see y'all again before I travel home."}
{"text":"I love going to this Port of Subs! By far the nicest people work in here. I believe one of which is the owner who is always so nice and genuine, I can't tell you how refreshing it is to see someone who actually cares about quality customer service now a days is few and far between but he defiantly does! My food is always great too! From one business owner to another- keep up the good work and great service it means a lot to those of us who take pride in quality!!"}
{"text":"Subs were ok. Employees were not very friendly. It was clean but I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Better portions than subway.  Nicer interior.  Overall pretty good.  Had the sour dough sub roll.. Nothing special and basically too much bread."}
{"text":"Port of subs is one of my top commercial sandwich spots but this place REALLY knows how to make a sandwich. I believe his name was Rico. He had a cool mustache. Much love Rico your sandwich skills are superior no doubt it's rare people take pride in what they do these days I want to comes to my food I especially appreciate it.  If that man isn't the manager already he needs a promotion and a raise  In the words and voice of my favorite politician \" I'll be back"}
{"text":"I've always loved Port of Subs. They're sandwiches are way better than Subway. This location stood out because it was by far the cleanest location I've been in yet! Even cleaner than the one by my house in Anthem. I was very impressed by this as well as their service."}
{"text":"Yum! I've been wanting to venture outside of Subway for a little bit- and I'm glad I tried this place. Staff was very friendly. Subs come in a range of sizes so you can save some $$ that way. The sub was delicious! Also, their avocado is real avocado slices instead of a spread like most places which made me very happy!"}
{"text":"My son requested I bring him another sub shop sandwich for his lunch after having teeth pulled unfortunately that location closed and in a scramble I called Port of Subs and placed an order over the phone. The worker was great and had my food ready right when I walked in so it was super fast. But for two 12\" #2 combos with bacon it was $24!!!!! That is an outrageous price for only sandwiches no drinks or chips... Then the sandwiches were just so so, nothing super special and almost worse than if I had just made it at home. Wont be going back here."}
{"text":"There is nothing more annoying than a restaurant closing before their posted hours. Hours on the window state 9pm and I showed up 15 minutes til. Shame on them and I won't be returning this this location."}
{"text":"The port is consistent and delicious. I've been eating Port of Subs for many years and don't intend to stop now. When I strike it rich, I'll have my own personal Port of Subs employee on call at my house."}
{"text":"All the girls looked like they were about to fall asleep including the manager. Maybe I'm just used to Jimmy John's, but this place is so slow!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are always good and they are consistent and I have never had to wait to long. I always get greeted by the employees when I go in and they have always been nice and courteous. Its a small location so there's a few tables to sit at. Overall I enjoy coming here for lunch!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are so good!  That good-quality, fresh-sliced meat makes the difference.  I always, always have to get one on sourdough, it's the best.  I never have to wait long for my food because they always whip it up quick, and the prices are pretty decent.  If i were to recommend a sub, it would be either the #1 with ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni & provolone on sourdough or the #18 with roast beef, turkey & provolone on sourdough.  Top either one off with the mustard/mayo mix & plenty of veggies and don't talk, just eat.  In the meantime, get yourself one of those fresh-baked cookies.  They are BOMB."}
{"text":"Friendly, good experience. The employees seemed like they were trying to move too fast is all. I bought the #9 pastrami and provologne but after the pastrami she put turkey instead of provologne. Meh not a big deal so I dont say nothing. Then I asked for mustard and the guy put mayo too but its fine i dont really mind mayo. Then when he passed it too the checker he said it was a #13 and thats what they rang up. Doesnt matter im sure its around same price. Overall it was good experience. Pastrami and turkeys pretty good together. They should just relax more no need to go so fast. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Quality sub shop. Slice the meats fresh for each sandwich. All the veggies looked and tasted fresh. 69 cents makes it a combo.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"I spent $14 for a large sandwich, small macaroni salad, and a cookie. So expensive and no drink.  The smell when you walk in is devine-fresh baking bread. Then you eat it and it's tough and dry. The lettuce looked old.  The salad came in a large container but was only filled less than halfway.  It took over 15 minutes to get my order and there were only 2 people in front of me. Go to Subway."}
{"text":"Always fast, fresh subs. The guys working are so friendly too!"}
{"text":"Walked into this location today, not an employee insight. No biggie, I'm in no rush. Looks at watch, almost five minutes pass. A young fellow rushes from the back shortly after. \"WHAT CAN I GET YOU\", he yells.   I reply, \"Well hello, how are you\"?  \"I'm fine\", he says.  Of course he doesn't bother to ask me how I'm doing, or \"apologize\" for the wait.   His entire tone and body language just had BAD ATTITUDE written all over. Perhaps he received a \"bad text\" from hubby.   I start to place my order and let him know the sandwich sizes and types of bread. He cuts the bread and places it on the counter, then walks away and stays gone for a few minutes.   I decide to leave after a few minutes. At this point, he was still in the back doing whatever.   Horrible."}
{"text":"After the owner contacted me and was super sorry for the way her store was treating my order and assured me it would be taken care of. She did replace my order when I was ready and the service was just like it's suppose to be! I wasn't ever gonna step foot into their establishment again but I'm super glad the owner reached out to me and made the situation wayyyyyy BETTER! I will continue going because of how the owner treats her customers like people!!! Thank you port of subs :)"}
{"text":"I doubt the owner reads these since the reviews are so low, but I dunno what happened to this place. I actually really liked port of subs. There sandwiches are tasty, cheap and fast. Plus this location is near my work and easy to get when I need a quick lunch.  Recently I have noticed the poor customer service. I have been asking for cucumbers which are never cut up, they hurry me along the line, and sloppily put together the sandwich. I am talking \"the contents are falling out and there is mayonaise on the ouside of the bun sloppy.\"   One time they had recently cleaned with bleach because you could smell it walking in. THat is gross enough, but later I touched my eye and my eyes started burning and the smell made me sick. I figured out that they must have touched the pens used to sign receipts with their bleach gloves and when I signed the receipt it got on my hands, later transfering to my eyes and nose. Basic negligence right there.    I am glad its a chain so that I can go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I just walked out of Port of subs on Rainbow and Charleston without the 2 sandwiches I ordered.  The girl and guy working there were so polite and helpful but when it came to ringing get out my order with 2 gift cards I received for my birthday they couldn't figure it out. No one had ever taught them how to do this transaction type. The gentleman called the manager who told him to call another store.  The person at the other store took the gift card #s but then couldn't explain how to check me out with my gift cards. Either that or they misunderstood the question. Now the line was building behind me and tired of waiting I left without my dinner. These 2 kids that worked there were completely embarrassed because of an oversight by management. REALLY!  How is a place run like that?  No wonder I rarely go to port of subs. Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"Best port of subs shop there is. I have been going here since '05. The workers here have always been the friendliest and most loyal people. They genuinely care about their customers and learn their favorite subs.  Food quality: A1. I just wish they had more options for vegans"}
{"text":"Our team at work ordered 8 sandwiches from DoorDash.  Port of Subs only made 7 sandwiches and when we called, they said we had to go to the store to pick up the 8th.  After driving over there (completely voids the reason we used DoorDash in the first place) they refused to make the 8th sandwich saying we didn't pay for it.  They were extremely rude even after I showed them the receipt saying I'd have to pay (again) for the sandwich.  They encourage you to use the app and then screw their customers when they do!"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh breads. Meats & cheeses sliced right in front of you. Fresh vegetables and extras.  Everything made to order.  And the counter and dining areas are scrupulously clean. Perhaps some of the previous reviews were flukes - or they got the message.  A chain place, but a good one! UPDATE:  I was typing the above on my phone, and forgot:  I always get polite, efficient service here; I often \"halve\" ingredients on sandwiches I'm splitting, have coupons, or use my loyalty card, and there's never an issue.  Like many food places, I think they've had to cut some hours to survive the minimum wage increase - happily, they seem to have kept the best of their sandwich makers on.  I'm a happy neighborhood customer, and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"There are Ports of Subs all over this fair city. This is my favorite location for sure. The staff is friendly and fast. I recently asked how long it might take to get a sub tray put together for a party. \"They have us say an hour, to be safe.\" Cool, I've got a little time, maybe I'll come back. \"But I can't imagine more than a half hour, and really, maybe twenty minutes.\" Hmmmm.... let's get it started in that case. Dude hooked it up in less than 10 minutes. Certainly not what you would expect at lunch time, but this was just about 7pm. I showed up to the party as a hero! (No pun intended.)   I've never had a wrong order, any snark or attitude, or so much as a frown in this place. They are quick and efficient, without hurrying the customer. And if you aren't completely satisfied, they'll do whatever it takes to change that.    If you think the food here is bland or tasteless, you don't know how to order a sandwich. And if you're ordering tuna salad at a deli, there's something entirely differently wrong with you."}
{"text":"Port of Subs is my favorite sub place in town and this is my favorite location!  I think what sets Port of Subs apart is the quality meat and their bread! I can't explain it but it's absolutely delicious. I like to get a #5 and have it grilled. That's another thing that makes them stand out, the grill. They aren't just warming your sub like competitors, it comes out smashed with grill lines...how I like it! :)  If you are a fan like I am, you should sign up for their point card. You get a free dessert for registering it online and after 100 points, you get a free sub. I know $100 seems like a lot to spend before you get a free sub, but you're gonna go there anyway...so why not get something extra just for swiping a card? They also give members a free sub on their birthday. I love birthday freebies!  The staff is always super friendly and fast. I rarely have to wait in line and when I do, it goes by pretty fast because the staff is efficient. There are other locations in the valley that just don't seem clean to me but I have never had to think twice about this location. They are my favorite!"}
{"text":"id rate it below zero if i could...the turkey sausage was rotten spoiled tasted like medicine and manager of store wouldn't make good on it... we ate none of it!!! Would not swap them out, issue refund DID NOTHING!!!!... Eat24 ended up taking care of it... STAY AWAY!!!! HORRIBLE FOOD HORRIBLE FRANCHISEE, HORRIBLE MANAGER OF THIS LOCATION!!!!"}
{"text":"Bless thee whom has created the Port Of Sub's #5.  The combination of smoked cheddar, turkey, and smoked ham makes my mouth water even as I write.  This location at 840 Rancho has been solid in the past.  It's as solid as lunch locations go.  Because of the previous experiences, I am averaging a four with a two and coming up with a three star experience.  The service was as it normally is....friendly and efficient.  On my most recent visit, what I had normally come to expect at any Port location, is fresh product.  Everything with the exception of the lettuce was just fine.  Much the way some fear spiders or open spaces, I fear vegetables which are not picture perfect.  Had the lettuce been a half a shade browner I would have requested my money back. Hunger made the presentation acceptable, but next time....I will just walk out.  Arrive early dining in, lunch can make finding a table difficult."}
{"text":"Since moving into the area we eat here at least once a week. Sandwiches are great. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Really friendly staff. Try the brownies. Yum!"}
{"text":"This Port of Subs location is one of the best in town!  They are open late till 2am everyday of the week which is amazing when you have that late night craving!! This location was very clean and the employees were very friendly. I love the #3 sandwich which is turkey, salami, and provolone (I substitute with Smokey Cheddar). The toppings are always fresh and delicious. You have to get the mustard/mayo mix. This is a staple of a port of sub sandwich. Sooooo bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"Damn good sandwiches. Mayo/mustard mix is the best. Just had their breakfast sandwiches and I was extremely impressed."}
{"text":"The fresh bread smell when you walk in is great. Don't bother downloading the app for points. The staff doesn't know know how to credit accounts for points. Okay sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is not a Port of Subs to visit. Always flies around, workers have the worst attitudes, bread is hard Or moldy at times sometimes both. The meat is thinner than paper and you won't get anything resolved by reporting. Just need to close this place down so many health violations seems like anyhow. Just don't come HERE!"}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed with this place. The bread was dry and fell apart as I was eating it...I wonder how old it was.....the cheese was sliced so thin you would hardly taste it, the girl behind the counter went CRAZY with the mustard (and the bread was still dry enough to crumble), None of the veggies had any flavor. Will definitely not get a port of subs sandwich again."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and really like it. It's always clean. If there is a line, it moves quickly. The staff is pleasant and helpful. The meats are sliced fresh when you order. They also have panini sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches that are available all day.  I was ordering my sandwich on sour dough, but there was always too much bread. Today I ordered it on white and it was perfect. The roll thickness was much smaller.  My only criticism is they don't have a lite or low calorie condiment other than mustard.   Definitely becoming a favorite stop for lunch!"}
{"text":"First time here. Stopped in around 1:30 on a week day for lunch. Would usually go to Subway, but we had a coupon for a free sandwich.  Ordered a 5\" with oven roasted chicken on wheat with no cheese and lots of veggies. My friend got an 8\" something on sour dough. We added chips and a drink to both. The sandwiches were big with a fair amount of meat and cheese. Plenty of veggies. Everything was fresh and tasty. The downside was the limited choice of condiments. Nothing lite or low calorie other than plain yellow mustard. I went with the mustard. Ended up with way too much, and it was very strong. The other thing is there was just way too much bread. I took the top bun off and solved both problems.  We got there at the tail end of lunch. There was a small line, but it moved quickly. Service was good. Everything looked clean.   Total for two sandwiches, chips and drinks was $17 before the coupon. A bit on the high side, but would go again. Would like to try a salad or grilled sandwich next time."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Port of Subs, but this place needs an overhaul.  Although it was clean, my sandwich had a taste of Pine Sol or some cleaning product.  My guess is that the counter-top where they made my sandwich had been cleaned with some sort of cleaner, I ended up throwing the sandwich away...."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The guy making the sandwich was rude. The sandwich had rotten cilantro in it and hardly any of the meat stayed inside the bread.  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"My new favorite sandwhich jount. Fresh ingredients. Meat is cut in front of you. I ordered the wrap and it was amazingly good. Very tasteful and customized it to meet my cravings"}
{"text":"I had a breakfast sandwich there one afternoon and the eggs were chalky. It was the worst fast food breakfast sandwich I've ever had. It was my first visit to Port of Subs & my last."}
{"text":"Good food. It takes a little bit longer for them to make the sandwiches because they freshly slice the meat & cheese, but no complaint there, it's fresh and tastes way better than subway. They are limited on the veggies they offer, would like to have cucumber and bell peppers available.  I really like their mayo/mustard mix."}
{"text":"Vic & Blue are the best!!!Vic & Blue are the best!!! Great costumer service, and amazing personalities. Never fails they know my order whenever I walk in."}
{"text":"Two hours to make a two sandwich order and then when their non-English speaking driver couldn't find the apartment despite being IN THE COMPLEX. After 10 insanely awkward minutes on the phone where I repeatedly tried to direct her to the right building \"stop here, no. STOP. The building you just drove past\" she just left and went back to the store without a word of warning. When we called to cancel the person who answered the phone very rudely informed us that we had the wrong address to our own house -- the same address every other restaurant in town has no problem delivering to (this was ordered through an app and my same address has been set as default with no issues for two years). Even were it wrong... and it obviously wasn't because their driver was IN the complex driving around on the phone with me... no attempt at all to resolve the problem before just leaving? What poor customer service."}
{"text":"Subs are always on point and staff is always friendly! The best part is always the fresh bread and they are quick on delivery!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I fell upon this place! We are frequent Subway customers and have finally found its competition!  I love the grilled sandwiches, especially the hot pastrami on white with provolone, jalapeño, and pickles.  My kids love the huge brownies! ...And the fresh sliced deli sandwiches too!  Never been busy when I've come in - maybe one or two customers but that all. The line moves quickly.  The service is friendly. I like how they say \"bye\" and \"come back soon\" as we leave. That used to be commonplace for businesses. What has happened to courtesy? I miss the south (raised in Texas)..."}
{"text":"My sandwich was truly amazing. The service was pretty quick, and the food was pretty good. Nothing more to say, it was a good meal."}
{"text":"After a long morning of food poisoning, missing baggage check-in for our flight, and then waiting for our flight, my boyfriend and I had a long morning. All we wanted was something simple before our flight and we were glad we have Port of Subs a shot. The workers were very laid back and we got our food in a decent amount of time. The food wasn't anything crazy but it filled us up and tasted pretty good. Just wish there were more items to add into your sandwich, but this ain't subway"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and courteous. Subs are soooooo delicious. Definitely the best subs out there!!!"}
{"text":"This is the hour, lunch to be specific, 10-7 if you wear a badge. My name is Skacey, I carry a short amount of time to get fed and get back to work.  11:43 AM, I step into the Port of Subs on West Badura. There are two dames behind the counter, to protect their identities, I'll call them Laverne and Shirley. There is one other patron in the establishment, quietly sitting and eating at a table by the window. As I step up to the counter, Laverne begins to head to the back and calls out to Shirley:  \"Hey, after this next order, can you clean the slicer\" is what I heard her say, but aparently, Shirley translated that comment to be \"I'm heading in back to slack off, you stay up here and work until your fingers bleed\"  At this point, I placed my order for a number one (always a safe bet at any fast food joint) As Shirley begins my order, I notice that she is heaping on piles of attitude. Now I'm not allergic to attitude, but I don't think its healthy to eat too much (I hear it gives you wrinkles) - In the interest of getting my order quickly, I let this go.  Once she is finished with the lunch meat and attitude, she moves to the veggies. In a monotone voice she rattles off the choices and I make my selection. As she begins piling on the foliage, she drizzles dispair and loathing on my sandwich. Now these are just plain unhealthy, but again, I'm pressed for time.  She finishes my meal and begins wrapping it up, she drops it next to the cash station and calls out to the back a word dripping with disapproval, snarkyness and vitriol. This single word impales itself on the back wall and runs down into a greasy puddle of hate. She said \"Register!\" clearly indicating that her toil was done and that someone else would have to deal with me as a pathetic customer.  Laverne does not show up again to help me, she is likely a quivering mess in the back, dealing with her own issues. The third lady (Joanie?) takes my money and sends me on my way. As I leave, the other patron and I share a glance which reveals our understanding of what just happened.  If you LOVE smashed bread, mediocre cold cuts, and average veggies, then perhaps it is worth seeing the drama that unfolds as young workers learn skills that will help them eventually raise the unemployment rate. Otherwise, you're better off driving 5 more minutes to another cheap belly filler."}
{"text":"Got a coupon from city of Surprise today so I  decided to take my family for sandwiches.   Although they just opened this location they handled the flow of customers well.  The staff was friendly and the food tasty.  They also led us on to some more coupons!  I think the sandwiches were bigger and tastier than other nearby chains.  I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Port of Subs locations left in town. I have to start paying for double meat because they have become thin it seems on the meat over the years. The meat and cheese was sliced fresh in front of me and this is a busy location so the bread comes out of he oven fresh all day. I like a few of the different sandwiches here so I change it up depending on what sounds good. The toppings always look and taste fresh but with the hustle and bustle of making sandwiches they get olives mixed with lettuce and so on. I don't like olives or certain other options so when I ask for lettuce and end up getting a few black olives on my sandwich, the flavor stands out. They have always taken coupons I have with no problem but they no longer take the punch card."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure going here. Friendly people. Not the fastest, but always good.  This is a great location and ample parking for your sandwich fix!  If you have a need for a 12 inch sandwich, check out tide subway!!!!"}
{"text":"As we walked in Dave greeted us . He is super friendly and gets right to work on our order .   The food here is so fresh and I love that they slice the meat and cheese in front of you . They are always making the sandwiches at this location the way you want them . We always order the 2 foot for 12.99 great deal and you can feed your family cheap .  We pass other locations, but, always go to this one . It is clean, friendly and fast service done right .   Thank you Dave for your above and beyond customer service . This is why we choose this location every time .   We will be back for sure personality goes along way with this family . If you are in the area for a fresh sandwich done right it is definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"This is a very average sandwich shop shoved into the same location as a Smoothie King to more than likely save money on rental space.   The location isn't disgusting like some of the previous reviews say but rather the set up and lighting made it seem unkept and untidy. I didn't get the feeling that roaches were running around but at the same time the dimly lit corners of the store front make it seem worse than it is. A bright shiny paint job and lighting improvement would go a long ways.   The food was basically the equivalent of a Subway with the bread not being nearly as good.   The service was pleasant and efficient.   Firehouse Subs just down the road would be a better option."}
{"text":"Decent sub for the price. Had a standard \"white boy lunch\": turkey on white with provolone, black olives, banana peppers, Onions, lettuce, tomatoes, oil, mayo and oregano. Lettuce could have been a little bit more fresh, but overall pretty tasty. Added chips and a drink for about $8 total.   Rocky was playing on the TV. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I eat here every week. This isn't the best sandwich shop in town but the location is convenient and they take the coupons I get in the mail. Not every location takes them and I refuse to pay regular price for a sandwich at port of subs. The $5 large coupons are the best but the BOGO coupons are great too. I had a old school stamp card from 2005 that I found in my desk and this location still took it even though they haven't used that rewards program in a while. I had my whole card stamped in so I just needed my free sub! I didn't expect him to take it but thought it was worth a try so it ended up working out and I gave him a tip.    The sandwich I ordered and always order is the #1 and that has ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni & provolone cheese on my choice of white bread. of course I have to add my toppings like mustard, mayo, onion yadda yadda. I like how they slice the meat fresh in front of you. They just don't put enough meat on it. The sandwiches here are good or I wouldn't eat them but like I mentioned before, to pay full price with out a coupon when you could get more bang for your buck at Jersey Mike's is crazy. keep your eye out for coupons or have family save them for you like I do!"}
{"text":"Not a bad sub which I find to be something I can eat almost daily.  Prices are a little higher than a Subway but their meat is freshly sliced to order and they do a much better job with their bread.  They are still lacking the hard crust french/Italian bread that I crave since leaving the East Coast but this is something I have learned not to expect out here in AZ.    The girls that work behind the counter are excellent and a few have been there for years.  They know service and are fast and great at keeping the lines at bay."}
{"text":"Excellent and friendly service, and probably the best sub sandwich I've ever had! Got the pilgrim griller and it was excellent! Will definitely come back when I'm on this side of town again!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. First off, my friend and I walk in and were just stared at for a bit before we got a curt, \"Hi\" from one of the employees. The woman who made our sandwiches was not nice at all. It seemed like we were bothering her by being there and having her do what she gets paid to do. She didn't ask if I wanted the oil, vinegar and seasonings, she just assumed I was done with my sandwich, and when I asked her to put them on she seemed irritated by it. There was another guy helping us and he was a tad nicer but didn't make much of an impression either. I work in the food service industry and know this is NOT how you treat customers."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this store for years, the staff is super friendly. The produce tastes very fresh, sandwiches are delicious!"}
{"text":"I have always loved port of subs! This one has been my favorite since I was a little girl. Friendly staff, great tasting bread and meat! My only problem is more with the company itself, they need to add more meat to there sandwich, After I put on my lettuce, tomatoes and other toppings, its becomes more of a veggie sandwich then an actual sandwich."}
{"text":"I ordered a 6 foot sub and they didn't deliver correct product- the order taker (John) assured us it would be correct and of course it was not- called to get it fixed and he didn't admit error- horrible service- wrong meat on sandwiches and served on a party platter - ruined our party theme - thanks a lot !"}
{"text":"I walked in. I wasn't greeted until I was next in line. I was then told they have to fill a catering order before taking my order and it would take 20 + minutes. I was ordering one sandwich for myself. This happened at 2:15pm on 12/16/17. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"First impression when I waked in was weird smelling inside. I was initially going to give port of subs a terrible review but as I sit here eating my sandwich I am forced to change my negative opinion because of the amazing sandwich I am eating right now. Will be going back. Recommend the sourdough bread!"}
{"text":"What the hell happened to POS? Hmmm maybe those initials mean something other that Port of Subs these days or at least that's how I feel. I remember when I first moved to Vegas and the sandwich scene was really lacking. POS was a place where you could get a sandwich on bread that was freshly baked and held the sandwich together and the fillings inside the sandwich were plentiful . Subway was a joke compared to POS but for the last few years Subway has nothing to worry about. Very sad for a Nevada based sandwich shop that and such a following and lines out the door at one time. Not the case anymore this POS was dead inside and is hardly noticeable tucked away in the corner of a shopping center that used to thrive at one time and has since changed a lot. I had the 2 foot sub deal and the bread tasted like it was old and not fresh. The veggies looked sad. I had the number 1 sub and it has 4 types of meat and 1 type of cheese on it. This sandwich looked so skinny and where was the 4 types of meat? More like 4 paper thin slices of who knows what meat and stake bread. I'll stick with Jersey Mike's from now on."}
{"text":"Everyone was so friendly, they made my food quickly, everything was clean, and they were playing some awesome music (: definitely my new favorite port of subs"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. It's so DIRTY. I saw bread left out on the back counter and the women that works there was about to use it for our sandwich but then put it away for the next poor fool that walked in after us. The lady that works there was RUDE. We didn't want cheese but she didn't bother to ask us what we wanted on the sandwich  and then got all pissy when we asked her to remove it. No apology from her just a dirty look!  Unbelievable!!  So this place is DIRTY and staff is RUDE. Stay away."}
{"text":"I had the experience of going to this Port of Sub location. I ordered a sandwich and and was greeted by a lady who represented herself as the owner.  She was very unprofessional while serving me.  I asked for the $5 sandwich and she told me that I was 10 minutes early for that special.  I totally understood and decided to wait the additional 10 to order. As I was waiting I overheard her telling one of the workers,  \"Who does he think he is?  Why would we serve him early.  He has to wait like everyone else.\"  I couldn't understand the attitude by this supposedly, professional who is serving the public? I immediately left and will never be back!"}
{"text":"I normally order the BLT.  Guess what?  I ordered the BLT again, but this time I had it grilled.  Grilled?!  Who knew Port of Subs grilled?  I know now.  Excellent, with a generous helping of bacon.  Mmm..."}
{"text":"Clean environment and friendly service. Food is fresh and well prepared. Loving the deals they offer and how well managed the establishment is. I come here to study and am always welcomed with friendly faces and fresh food. Drinks are always dispensed without delay which is to say their equipment is well maintained. Love watching football here ... it feels like home."}
{"text":"Desiree rocks!  Taking 3 peoples orders at once to keep the line moving.  Every order perfect, and fast."}
{"text":"I love port of subs and this one is very clean, professional and the sub was excellent.  I recommend this location to any one in the area.  Clean, bright and well lit with a very clean bathroom."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this an update as there has been new management at this location. I must say the cleanliness is still there but I've noticed an upbeat mood and far better customer interactions from all staff. This is still one of my favorite spots but I do like that even with all of us regulars they remember our orders and names. I'm still keeping this as my go-to spot and five stars."}
{"text":"So I am a HUGE fan of port of subs sandwiches. The taste is great! But the staff here is so bad to be completely blunt. I've been to other locations and the service is spot on.. but for some reason at this location the staff seems miserable, not friendly by any means, and my sandwich is prepared sloppily. And every time I come by it gets worse. This isn't about EVERY worker. Every time I'm helped by Kayla I get great service. But everyone else is extremely rude and I'm sick of it. My message to management: keep your staff in check! The good product isn't enough to keep me coming here anymore.. disappointing"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches.  Can't really explain it, but it's not the same as any other sandwich joint (like Subway or Blimplies).  My recommendation is that someone make a good business move and open one of these places out here.  MMMM...."}
{"text":"Of all the chain Sub shops this one is the best. The bread is fresh and the veggies always ripe and fresh when ordering a large party tray. I love their online ordering for parties and events. The menu is easy to navigate and is always ready when promised. They will even whip something together at the last minute.  Our guests think these sandwiches came from a gourmet shop and are quite surprised when I tell them they came from Port of Subs. The parking is terrible so I deduct one star but that is definitely out of their control. Hungry for a great fresh sub? Look no further than Port of Subs."}
{"text":"Stopped by this location on Saturday May 6th, 2017 around 12:00p to pick up subs for lunch, or so I thought.  Walked in and was greeted by two employees.  One promptly asked \"Are you here to order?\".  My first reaction was to come off with a smart remark but figured I'd try the up-front approach. I replied, \"Yes\".  The employee quickly replied with \"We are working on a very large catering order so we are not taking orders\".  I was speechless, so I simply said, \"Okay, Thanks.\" and turned around and walked out.  I thought to myself, must be nice to have enough business to turn away a paying customer..  I'll give my money to Jersey Mikes from now on."}
{"text":"Horrible service and extremly rude. My sandwich today was disgusting and ruined my lunch. Can't believe how much I use to rav about this place. 2 thumbs down!"}
{"text":"No meat so thinnly sliced and the cheese was less..As the person was cutting the\"cheese\" i laughed..as you kidding. Well maybe it tasted good NOT..You get just bun and lettuce that is all I tasted... ..but if you like bread and lettuce the pace to be...gross...........  over priced try chompies for $2.00 more you get 10 times more meat!!"}
{"text":"09/28 @5pm horrible customer service.  3 employees standing around not one asked \"can I help you?\" I'll take my money next door instead."}
{"text":"I started eating at this port of subs about 6 months ago after several years eating subway sandwiches.  I love that the meat is freshly sliced, the bread is always fresh too. The sandwiches are huge! The staff is always friendly and personable.  I had them make a sandwich platter for a group i hosted and everyone liked it. They do get very busy around lunch time, but even then they are fast and friendly.  There are plenty of good places in this area but this is my favorite."}
{"text":"I thought this place was delicious! First time I've been here. Great sandwiches and they send coupons out in the mail. However, my only complaint was the staff. The sandwich maker was not friendly and she started texting immediately after she was done making our sandwiches. And then she gossiped with the other employee until we left. Not great service but great food!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Sandwiches are so yummy. A little overpriced in my opinion, but still worth it. I like this location but it is so hard to hear the workers. It echoes and the TV was on too loud."}
{"text":"FIRST!   This Port of Subs is great. I always joked with my co-workers about coming here because it's right across the street from the Spearmint Rhino, and one of my co-workers claims he has never been, or knows where it is.   In any case, when it came time to visit this Port of Subs, he was too busy, so he gave my other co-worker and I his order.  The sandwiches are spot on here. All the meats and cheeses are freshly sliced, and the bread is hand sliced all the way through.   They have this mustard/mayo combination that I absolutely love.  Great place for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! Sandwichs with ATTITUDE!  Stopped in on a lunch break and was one of seven people in line.  This amount of people seemed to put the four people behind the counter in a tizzy.  When it came time to top off my favorite, the #5, they ran out of pepperoncinis. The sandwich girl who was already throwing out attitude said that they were all out.  Why do I find this hard to believe?  Something must have been wrong with the bread oven today.  My sandwich ended up looking like smoked turkey, ham and cheddar on a wheat breadstick.  I decided to not make a thing about it and completed the order."}
{"text":"This establishment has completely gone downhill with their new management and their new hires for associates. Their new store manager had a negative comment for both of my sandwich orders, I let it slide because I've worked retail, I know customer service, I get it, maybe you've had a tough day. But as a customer that's been visiting this specific Port of Subs location for over 10 years, it's really not okay. They've become stingey with their add ons, I paid almost $3 to add on bacon to a large 12\" sandwich, and they put 3 pieces on my sandwich. Absurd.   For the prices and quality (or lack there of) you're better off going to Capriotti's - or any other sandwich parlor to be honest, because you'll receive quality and fairer prices.   No reason to be walking into a Port of Subs, and paying $25 for two sandwiches (one medium and one large)."}
{"text":"Forced to eat here again today due to proximity to work. Tuna sandwhich tastes like cat food. Please someone teach them how to rinse and drain tuna well prior to adding mayo and other ingredients. Will NOT be forced to eat here again. Would rather go without food."}
{"text":"The subs are very good, the staff is very friendly.  I had my first port of Subs sub at a Bike MS event, and keep going back because of their fresh subs, friendly team and their dedication to the fight against multiple sclerosis."}
{"text":"I frequent this particular port of subs regularly, the food is always fresh and excellent, and I think the staff, as well as owner of the business is very nice. Top service, great sandwiches, great choice."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. The worst customer service I have ever received. The girl that was working threw her knife down when she misheard me say that I'd like white bread.I think she needs to find a new job or be sent home. HER ATTITUDE SUCKS!!! I've been coming to this port of subs for years and after today I will never return."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  We loved the previous owners.  The family mewmbers were friendly and welcoming.  We went back today to find a new crew.  They were clueless.  I had to correct how they made a simple hot pastrami.  I was also surprised that they had eliminated the miltiary discount.  I put the svaings back in the tip jar, so it is not a big deal from a financial perspective, but the idea of eliminating something like that is disconcerting.  We used to go once a week for lunch.  I don't think we'll be back now."}
{"text":"I only leave a piss poor review so that the manager might try to improve the quality of food so people won't get sick... I go in about two weeks ago and order a WAY overpriced turkey sub...get a stale as hell piece of bread that makes me cringe. I can see the condiments through the glass, another mistake made by management... If you don't want to gross people out don't show them the food. The mayonnaise had that weird aerated layer on top indicating it had been out... In a big ol open bowl without refrigeration. I looked over to the jalapeños..same story... Can jalapeños get crusty? Apparently so. I apologized and left before she could put some pretty slimy looking turkey on my... Bread. Sorry lady, it's not your fault your boss has piss poor expectations of you and the food he's serving... And expects someone to pay 8$ for that. Wow"}
{"text":"I've ordered from her twice now, and we have yet to get our order correct. Cucumbers migrate to sandwiches they weren't ordered on, parts of orders are missing. Twice was enough. I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly Port Of Subs location. They have my favorite Maui Onion chips! Free refills of fountain drinks and great sandwiches and raps. My wife's favorite is the bacon and turkey wheat rap with avocado  the avocado is extra but worth it."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! The food was wonderful but the delivery driver was rude and unprofessional. I thought I placed a tip on the card but it didn't go through. The driver when leaving asked if he there was a tip for him. When I stated I left one on the card he replied no do I get one.   Besides for this the food is delicious and I will eat another location."}
{"text":"We tried Port of Subs (our usual sub spots are Jersey Mike's and Firehouse) and really liked it.  The service was superb.  The sub was made to our order, and was just right.  We bought 3 feet of the sub number 1 on white, and the bread was soft and moist.  I will definitely return to this location.  And, they laughed at my dumb jokes during the ordering process - that in itself is a big plus!"}
{"text":"Simple fast and clean Post of Subs location.   The management is friendly and the girls behind the counter get your stuff done fast and with a smile.   The can cater your office party at the last minute as well."}
{"text":"Just saw the owner/manager verbally berate her whole staff in front of the entire restaurant. Most unprofessional thing I've seen in any restaurant or retail environment. I feel bad for the staff- they were providing great service on Christmas Eve!  I see there's other negative feedback on here about her-- corporate should step in because she's a bad representation of their brand."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had an excellent sandwich. The service was courteous and quick."}
{"text":"Great subs!  I also learned that they are fighting MS and are a partner of Bike MS.  Must go."}
{"text":"Great sub the meat and produce were fresh. The key to this place is the manager. He is super friendly and always inviting. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"By far, the best subs in Vegas. I love Subway for day-to-day meals but Port of Subs is like a treat. When you load them up with EVERYTHING, these monsters are awesome! I've since moved from Vegas to Korea to Phoenix and now it's 13 miles from work to the nearest one :("}
{"text":"Love this place! I eat here 2-4 times a week and ya just can't beat the sandwiches! Always FRESH bread and will all the meats, cheeses, etc sliced fresh to order, you really can TASTE the difference! Mike (the owner) does a great job to ensure you get the best sandwich and great service! TWO THUMBS UP!  DonaldBakewell.com"}
{"text":"This Port of Subs is a quick ride from my job. I work at a family business, so I am often joined for lunch with my father and brother. We all love it!  The staff knows us (and our strange orders) by heart. My dad always gets the same tuna salad, with bizarre specifications -- he hates lettuce, so he gets a bed of onion and tomato instead, plus he prefers a downpour of vinegar to anything resembling dressing. What's so great about the girls at this place is that they take the time to remember the specifics. Yesterday, my dad ordered a meatball sub, which was a compete betrayal of his regular order, and the girl almost had a heart attack.    I've always preferred Port of Subs to its competitors, like Subway or Quiznos. I love the endless options, and that they slice the meat fresh. I'm also a fan of the flavors. Whenever I bite into my regular (medium #15 on wheat with added turkey), the taste just sends me right back to childhood.   Something to note... They're making the sandwiches fresh, slicing each and every piece of meat, and handcrafting the toppings as per the customer's choices. That sort of care takes time! It just does. So the complaints about long lines and slow service fall flat for me. If you want FAST food, then maybe Port of Subs isn't the place for your quick lunch break.   Also, as an employee of a family business, I happen to appreciate that this Port of Subs is a family affair as well. I noticed some previous reviews knocking the company for this... But I certainly don't think it's a con, in any capacity, for a family to run a restaurant. They know what they're doing, and they do it well."}
{"text":"Great people work at this location! This is my family and friend's spot!!! I'd say we eat here 2-3 times a week. I chose this location, like always, because everything is fresh and made exactly how I like it :) Never have I had a bad experience here!! Staff knows us by name. Good people and great food!! It can make your day..."}
{"text":"Literally walked in right behind a couple and I was told by the guy still slicing meat that they would be his last customers. Although there was still 5 minutes until closes do we walked in simultaneously. Coming from the service industry it was completely unacceptable. I will never return to this location as I was refused service because some young kid wanted to leave early."}
{"text":"Service can be a bit slow, but the sandwich is always delicious. I like the fresh ingredients and especially the cheese. The smoked cheddar is my favorite!"}
{"text":"This place needs to close down. There smoothie tastes like crap. All they Put in it was yogurt and a few strawberries for $6! Come on ! I could've made that at home."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'll eat here.  They have a few choices of sandwiches. Nothing compared to subway. They have \"grilled\" sandwiches, and just regular ones on sub bread.   Everything is pretty minimal. They have basic cold cuts, turkey, ham, and then tuna. The tuna is pretty good.  I like mine with peppercinis, spinach, smoked cheddar, salt, pepper. oregano, a splash of vinegar, and some red onion.  Just like their sandwich list, their veggies are nothing compared to subway.  Very minimal, no jalapenos, no cucumber, you get the point."}
{"text":"The manager at this store is so good at her job.  She is gold.    Although, they really skimp on avacado.  I know they are expensive, but when I am paying the same amount for a vege as I would for roast beef, I should get an adequate amount of the main ingredient."}
{"text":"I ordered a party platter for my store. I walked in and talk to a young staff member, Uno . He asked some questions and helped me to get my tray ready. The owner then came out and suggested that I call to make sure all went well on Saturday. I called and spoke with Melanie. She said that she would get everything ready for me and I can pick up. I arrived at the location and she told me what she had ready suggested some things for me. It took minutes to get it paid and I was out the door!  I have never met a more pleasant and friendly staff. I will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The lady with the heavy makeup was very rude! I have been here many times and she was terrible!  Makes you not want to go in there!  The owner was very nice! Didn't see him on my last visit."}
{"text":"Ask and you shall receive!! Freshest bread, freshest machine hand sliced turkey and roast beef for me and Eric piled on every vegetable I asked for my extras creating a huge incredible 5 inch which felt like 10. Way to go Eric at Port of Subs!! You really know how to make a sandwich!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened. Great quality, but very rushed and not as people friendly. I felt rushed through today and wasn't even offered anything to carry my drinks to the car :-/ Very low quality of concern for the customer! Quality is nice though and it's open later than most Port of Subs!"}
{"text":"Bread is decent, but service is terribly slow and unfriendly, portions are extremely small and thin, prices are too high for what you get, and the add-ins were not that fresh.  I doubt that I will return since there are so many better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Love port of subs! The employee sat this location are always nice, friendly, and seem to enjoy their job! It's always clean, the veggies always look fresh, and the eating area is always nice and tidy! Wish all chain sandwich places were as good as port o subs! If you've never been you'll love that they slice their meat and cheese fresh and have smoked cheddar (my fave ) and the bread is baked fresh daily!"}
{"text":"Used a coupon to go here and try it for the first time. Got a veggie and I had to create a club sandwich as one is not on the menu. The meat and cheese is all cut fresh on a slicer!  The person eating the veggie said it was the best she ever had when compared to other sub shops.   My club was good but the amount of meat was pretty light. Then again all these places nowadays weigh or count the slices of meat. The bacon was really good actually.   They have three bread choices. Wheat, white, and sourdough. I had the sourdough and really liked it.  One employee was new and the other seemed to be the mgr. We will be back. 8\" cold subs are $5.99 and 12\" are $7.99.  They offer hot sandwiches as well. Good spot."}
{"text":"I love this Port of Subs! The staff is very friendly and make me feel at home. Everything is very neat and clean and I always get what i want. I have been going here for several years now and the staff changes pretty often but everyone is always nice. I would recommend this place over any other locations."}
{"text":"This seems to be a chain throughout the greater Las Vegas area. We were looking for a somewhat healthful lunch to make us feel like we were having a healthy weekend sans bad food and alcohol. Denial is a great thing!  The place has the feel of a Subway, but what sets Port of Subs apart is that the meat and cheese are sliced to order. Was the sandwich stellar? No. Was it satisfying after a late evening? Sure.   Kudos for having fresh brewed ice tea, although we really should have been re-hydrating with water."}
{"text":"Ok...why the 1 star for a sub shop? Well...the list could be quite long for this location and the others I have visited, i think 2 or 3 more and I have had some brought back to me or went to a party and the trays were sitting on the counter and I was forced to eat it or enjoy chips and water...so this one location will get my review since I have been here I think 2 times (not by choice) and I will leave it at that.  First off, walking in to this spot feels like you are walking into a business that is actually about to close. Presentation should be key with a sub shop place, and this location is way out of whack.   Walking in I was interested in seeing how they stand up against Sub shops like Subway or Jersey Mikes and this place didn't even get on the same page as those 2 chains.  I don't want to drag this on. The overall quality of the subs are bottom of the barrel, with horrible portion controlling at pretty high prices for what they are offering. The meat was nothing spectacular at all. Extremely basic, honestly I don't want to carry on with this chain.  I don't call this place Port of Subs, I call it Port of Shits, because that is exactly what it is. This company is making money and I have no idea how or what the guest are enjoying with these subs. Maybe I am missing something or just am use to a freshness and flavorful sandwich at the competitors location..  I will never buy a sub @ this location or any ever again."}
{"text":"The lady who is always working here is so sweet and service is fast. It's a cold cut sandwich place. My expectations are never high, but I refuse subway and there isn't a blimpies so here I am every so often for a ridiculous ly huge turkey sandwich. It not a frilly place. No fancy sandwiches, but you may get a wrap or paniniesque sandwich. The veggies are always fresh. And super clean smellin good. If your hungry and looking for a quick bite it's a dependable spot."}
{"text":"All Port of Subs are not created equal. I've lived down the street from this place for about a year now and every time eat there they have fresh toppings and very friendly service. My girlfriend and I have made it one of our regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"Great subs! Fresh cut meats and cheeses with toppings of your choice. Highly recommend! ($4.99 for a 5inch, $6.99 for an 8inch for example)"}
{"text":"Friendly workers and nice place to grab a sandwich.  I love the mayo and mustard is mixed--makes it taste better.  Clean and consistent."}
{"text":"Clean with friendly employees.  Located Next to Starbucks.  I love the mayo and mustard is mixed...that's my favorite thing about Port of Subs!!"}
{"text":"I came in today around noon for lunch. The guy behind the line (homely looking dude with a beard) pulled his pants up 3 times (while taking 10 minutes) making my salad. Once before touching the spinach and once while scooping the cheese. This is unacceptable and way to long to wait for a salad.  Can your employees not afford belts, or are they two disgusting to wear them? Are they not trained to change gloves after touching non foods items?"}
{"text":"Very soggy and tasteless sandwiches **  The training seems to be constant at this restaurant.  No one has a clue as what to do...  Feels like a catered event, where the owner has his family help - but no one wants to be there..."}
{"text":"Every time I come hear I get great service and everything. No complaints and also called to pick in advance and it was ready as always"}
{"text":"Food is great but this location is almost always understaffed and wait times of more than 5-10min are not uncommon and much longer during busy weekday lunches. Staff is not particularly friendly or welcoming due to their work load."}
{"text":"This place is clean and the people are very friendly. I have never had a bad experience with them... Food is very good! I think the one on DI does double stamp on Fridays. The one on Marilyn across from UNLV YUCK! dirty and the people aren't very friendly."}
{"text":"\"Just another subway\" was my exact words as I walked in here with the hubs. He turned to me and said, \"No, it's MUCH better\".  He was correct!... the BLT had plenty of bacon as well as tomatos and lettuce. (I notice other sandwich shops have skimped on the meat and piled on more veggies to save money).  A bit more expensive (like Quizno's price), but does not have a strange or distinctive odor about the sandwiches or the place. Very clean! And they offer cookies that are bigger than my palm. I could sink my teeth into another one if they only had it in Arizona..."}
{"text":"My favorite Port of Subs on the planet!! Kenny and Joy in Store #38 on West Flamingo need to get an award from The Company. Their store is always clean and stocked. They greet you when you come in and always remember the way you like your sandwich made, and I am very picky. Their condiments are always stocked and fresh, and I feel that makes a huge difference on the taste and freshness of your sub. I refuse to ever eat at any other port of sub's, because when you have perfection, you can't duplicate that... I feel that the corporate office of Port of Sub's needs to pay a visit to this Awesome store to fully appreciate how unbelievably Great it is, and then they should give them an award for the Best on the Planet!!! 5million Stars!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I hit up Port of Subs today for lunch with a coworker and, I must say, I was very prepared to give this place a bad rap (no pun intended...oh wait...I haven't gotten to that part yet...hold that thought). I was expecting a low-end Subway (which I don't really enjoy in the first place), so imagine my delight when I found out that they have warm sandwiches in addition to subs, and in addition to warm sandwiches, they have wraps [insert pun joke here]! I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork wrap, and was excited to find that one of the things that they do have in common with Subway is the \"choose your own toppings\" option. I'm pretty simple when it comes to my sandwiches, so this is an appealing feature for me. I ordered it with onions and pepperjack cheese, and after they'd tossed it on the grill I paid up and sat down to enjoy. And oh, did I enjoy! That wrap didn't stand a chance...after the first bite I was sold. I would have downed it much more quickly than I did if I hadn't been with a coworker that I didn't know super well...no use giving her the impression that I'm a total pig.   I wouldn't say it was dirt cheap, but $9.36 for a wrap, a bag of chips and a soda isn't overly expensive, either, and it was WELL worth it. I highly recommend this place, a) because they give you options and b) because their food is yummy...or at least the pulled pork is!   I see from Russell S.'s review that this place is, in fact, a chain, but since I am not a Phoenix native and therefore have been left to form an opinion of this place all on my own without any pre-disposed bias (no offense, Russell...it happens to the best of us), I'm inclined to give this place 2 thumbs up (read: 4 stars)...hopefully, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Better than subway as far as quality of meats, bread, and vieggies.  The cost may be slightly more than subway, but I would choose Port of Subs because the food is better.  I like that the meat and cheese is sliced right when you order it.  I spent about 8 dollars on a sub, drink, and chips which isn't that bad.  If I want to go with a better option I would choose Capriotis, but I have to be willing to pay more for higher quality.  Service was pretty good and the place was clean and neat."}
{"text":"I'm thinking (and hoping) this place slowly puts Subway out of business. Quality sandwiches, fresh ingredients, a nice atmosphere and friendly service. Everything you'd want a tasty sub sandwich to be this place is. I've been to locations all over Arizona and California for Port of Subs but this one is by far my favorite (not that the others are bad mind you). The bread is always fresh and fluffy and tastes like it came from a local bakery. The meats and ingredients are always high quality and fresh as can be and the prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Best location of port of subs! The subs are good, the store is clean but most importantly the service is incredible. Miguel goes above & beyond. He is considerate of vegetarians, even offered to clean the meat slicer for us. It's not often you get someone who not only clearly loves their job but goes the extra mile for you!"}
{"text":"First time here and got a footlong #1.  It was delicious for a sub!  Loaded with meat and veggies unlike skimpy Subway.  Located in a convenience store. Great and friendly service.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great Sandwich shops are abundant here in the dessert (Jimmy John's, Capriotti's, Jersey Mike's.... This place is just another to add to the list  Lunch Special Prices:  Ham and Salami + Pastrami and Swiss sandwiches: Good Bread, Meats, Veggies.. Simply Satisfying!  What stood out most was their service here.. I got here during lunch hours and there was a line that almost stretched out the door. In no time, I gave my order to the lightning fast staff. Looking through the glass, displayed their prep table and deli slicer.. I saw a show of teamwork working under pressure without breaking a sweat, not missing a single customers needs and smiling the whole time doing it. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I come here almost every day for lunch. Staff is incredibly friendly and remembers you. Online orders done precisely. Quality of sandwiches outshines other deli places. All for a good price. I would recommend the lettuce wrapped tuna for a good blend of hearty eating and nutrition. A must go for health buffs who hate planning lunches.   - Steven"}
{"text":"Can you say no sense or urgency and Chinese fire drill? This place is a hot mess. It literally took 10min to make my two sandwiches with 4 workers and on top of that 3 people jumped in to make both sandwiches -.- there's no assembly line going on and there was 4 people in line as well. Somehow they all a mange to finish everyone's sandwiches first then then rang everyone up at the end. Like wtf management doesn't know how to handle or delegate the staff when it's busy I should know since I do management on the strip :-/ I should just stick to my Port of subs location in Green valley. Gave them two stars because the one girl behind the counter was friendly and had a smile on her face. :)."}
{"text":"They were fast and friendly. I got the roast beef and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, my second time was just recently. It was an impulse decision after stopping at Petco and I'm glad I stopped in.  The service was friendly and welcoming and they made my sandwich quickly. For the price, it's a good value. The quality is much, much better than what you'd find at a Subway (ew).  Dine-in or carry out, pick your poison! Although the inside is a little out dated, I did overhear the manager mention a 5 day renovation project which I believe they're currently working on.  I'm going to stop back in when they re-open for a toasted #1 and will update my review in regards to the decor. I don't expect any issues in service or food quality so I'm sticking with my 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago my husband and I picked up a couple of subs here. The place was clean, the employees were friendly, and the sandwiches were really delicious. It's nothing fancy, just a sub shop. It was actually our first team going to Port of Subs and we both agreed that we definitely will return in the future."}
{"text":"I love this store and the food. But the staff makes it worth the drive they remember what I'm going to order before I even open my mouth! It's always cleans there always polite the always get a nice tip they deserve the 5 stars they got from me keep up the good work!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"When it's not 7:00PM and you lock your doors, that's horrible customer service. It's making a sandwich.. it takes 5 minutes."}
{"text":"You need to update your Yelp hours. I drove here to find out they were closed!! They really close at 7PM and not 8PM. Really a big inconvenience."}
{"text":"#SkipTheLine...yeah not so much. This was my first and last time going to this place. I placed an order 30 minutes before my lunch break at work hoping I could just walk in, get my food and get back to work with time to spare to enjoy my food. When I got to the restaurant, they hadn't even began on my order...that I submitted 30 minutes ago. I waited an additional 20 minutes for them to prepare my sandwich all while I kept hearing \"sorry\" time and time again for the wait. Paid for my food and left. It was until I sat down and unwrapped my sub to find how disturbing it looked. It looked like they just threw everything into the wrapping and wrapped it...never again."}
{"text":"I went there today, a lady behind counter whipped counter and with the same gloves she was serving customer before me with pickles and jalapeños, next I was but the clothes dirty gloves was already whipped in his sandwich, it's grouse to see that ,   I will not go there anymore  Sanitation sanitation sanitation"}
{"text":"I cannot believe the incompetence of the employees at this store! They rush for absolutely NO reason, my meat was hanging out of my sandwich like a 5 year old made it, I asked for wheat, she gave me white so I had to correct her, then she cut my meat before even HAVING THE BREAD READY, that's why the meat was uneven! I've been eating Port of Subs for 8+ years and this is the worst store I've been to. They have the Subway mentality, just throw shit on the bread!"}
{"text":"I Stopped in at 4:30 on the dot to grab a quick sub.  The sign and door states open till 5pm.    The door was open an all of the patio furniture was still up outside.  Upon entering there was only two younger employees inside.  In my opinion, they both looked defeated as to the fact that someone still wanted a sandwich a half hour before closing time.  The young woman yelled \"We're closed\" to which I quickly pointed out the store hours on the door.  She yelled again, \"Yea we're closed though\".    I walked out and went next door to Dunkin Donuts who gladly served me.  I can't comment on the quality of food or the value, as I never made it more than 5 steps in to the place.  One star based on incorrect store hours OR lazy employees."}
{"text":"This is the worst port of subs I have ever been to. I have tried to go to this port of subs many of times only to discover that they have closed early.  If you are lucky to catch them 20 minutes before they were suppose to close they won't offer the full menu either. I was told that I could only have a turkey or ham sandwhich on white bread because they put everything else away. On top of that I waited out front for 5 minutes for them to even come out and greet me because they were too busy in the back trying to close the building down. I will never give this place my business again. This location gives port of subs a bad reputation."}
{"text":"The sandwich left me feeling like I swallowed an anchor, and the employees had their shoes off while on break in the dining room. Not once did I see them wash their hands after returning from break to make another customer a sandwich. 1/5 wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"This location just opened. It's in a weird spot next to a car rental place so there's not a lot of parking. Once you get inside you will find it is very spacious, and clean too like a new restaurant would be. Other than that it's a typical Port of Subs.  When I walked in the staff was very friendly and welcoming. They do no skimp at all with regards to sandwiches, you get all the meat, cheese, and veggies you pay for. They are a bit slow but many employees are new, so be patient. But it's a new store so I'm sure they'll work all that out."}
{"text":"The best Port of Subs ever!!!!  I don't why they are so outstanding, but they truly are!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop in Las Vegas. I love the little mayo/musturd spread that they have. They have many locations around Las Vegas, check this place out and give it a try."}
{"text":"Friendliest, cleanest and most generous store in the valley that I've visited. And that's a lot. They honor the rewards card as well. Always fast and fresh. The employees communicate with you and actually care to ask how you are. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"This is a great location! Very clean, very friendly staff and very fresh ingredients. I have no complaints whatsoever. Nicholas is a super guy!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I'm reviewing a sub shop in an airport but after all my years of traveling; I will. IMHO, this is 'as good as it gets' in terms of a sandwich that you can get in an airport. Its way better than the classic junk wrapped in the plastic containers that you usually have to suffer thru.   This is an above average sub - priced extremely well for Vegas airport.  If you need a meal for the plane - this is it."}
{"text":"So excited its open! Port of subs is my jam! So far so good. This ones right by work, super nice and new inside employee was nice and efficient my samich tasted great!  Get the 18 on Ha-weet (wheat) with smoke chedda instead of provolone, A1!"}
{"text":"OMG! This location is a joke. I got there, 10:40 am, and guess what?! The door was locked. Then comes this very rude guys opens the door and not even say hi or anything. I was trying to decide what to eat, and he was like, so What do you want? I just couldn't believe the kinda of customer service they provide at this location. Also when I went to pay, he. was expecting me to tip him, as soon as he saw that I didn't tip him he gave me a dirty look. I hope you get fire, because seems like you don't need this job.  Never coming back. This all happened today, October 23, 2016."}
{"text":"We ordered subs for our entire team and they were 5 hours late , our team had to play a game on empty stomach then after game had to wait another 2 hours before we got out subs... No Bueno"}
{"text":"This place was extremely rude when asked to fill a catering order for my coworkers and I at work. They would not work with us and treated us like we were not wanted. Avoid this place like the plague"}
{"text":"This Port of Subs service was outstanding. I went there the very next day. They are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"After only eating subway for years now I finally thought it was time to try another sandwich chain shop. I'm so happy I did!!! The only thing I don't like are the pickles subways are better. Other than that bread is flatter you can even get a lettuce or wheat wrap!"}
{"text":"LOL. The size of my sandwich is laughable. I got a turkey and provolone on a flatbread instead of a sub roll. Didn't know it would be toddler sized. Also, the store is dirty and gross...just look at how filthy the register is. Gross. Never again."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've had so far: #5 on sourdough with the mayo/mustard spread! (It's a combo spread and it's pretty delish). Smoked ham, turkey, and smokey cheddar cheese, yum!  This sub restaurant sets itself apart from other sub chains by offering a bigger selection of good breads (including the aforementioned sourdough bread mmmmmMMMMmmmm) and cheeses, and freshly slicing its meats and cheeses. I, uh, have never worked in a deli, or really in any food service type of industry, so I don't know if this actually makes the meat and cheese better...though it does mean it isn't sliced days/weeks/months earlier, right? Must be at least a bit fresher. It is tastier than I remember Subway or Quizno's being.  The service is a touch slower, because of the fresh slicing, but still very friendly.  I think the biggest problem at this Port of Subs might be the parking lot. Doesn't seem like it would ever be filled (it's huge), but the people driving are, well, sort of terrifying, and there's people walking around a lot. So just be careful, please!  I would definitely recommend this sub restaurant for a quick meal on the go!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I've tried Port Of Subs and the experience wasn't what I expected - the morning crew needs to work on their Customer Service!!!!   My husband and I came in while we waited for our Starbucks drink to be made. We both ordered Breakfast paninis the team member making our panini (I don't remember his name i threw away the receipt)  seem bothered while he was creating the sandwich... My husband asked if he can add the Avocado Spread to his panini and he verbatim said \"are you going to add Avocado to a breakfast panini??!\" An shook his head... I'm sorry, but it's not the team members choice to add/take away anything on a sandwich their there to satisfy and go above and beyond for their customers...   After this experience I won't be coming in Again!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this place. The food wasn't very good and it was overpriced compared to other sub places. The service however was very friendly and the store was nice and clean."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get a sub before my class at JoAnns. No sense of urgency whatsoever. Receipt didn't have an item breakdown for my meal. So why my tiny sandwich was 8.09, I won't know. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Update: A few days after my original Yelp review I received a call from Gina at Port of Subs corporate. We received an apology for our poor experience. We were offered 2 large combos along with dessert... under the condition that we return to that exact location and mention the managers name. While it certainly WAS a nice gesture, wouldn't  it would be better to just do the right thing everyday, instead of only when management is watching? Sorry, but I am still choosing to say no to this port of subs location."}
{"text":"I called port of subs last minute for a large order and the manager I believe his name was David answered and told me they could do the order and have it ready before the time I specified with no problems. I repeated everything I wanted not sure he heard me right and he again said it was no problem and when I went to pick up before the time I quoted, everything was ready including all the extra fixings and utensils and he even helped me carry it out to my car. I was extremely pleased with the entire situation. I have always like port of subs in general but now will make sure to order our large orders from them more often. Very wonderful service I highly recommend!!! The order was also for 80 people."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! My first time trying Port of Subs was a few weeks ago when my coworker insisted we go. I'm a customer for life! I haven't been to the other locations but I can't imagine better customer service. The crew who work the afternoon shift (two guys and a girl) provide excellent service. When I mentioned it was my first time, they seemed genuinely excited and proud of the product they put out. Whoever manages/owns this franchise should be proud of the staff he/she has working there! They deserve raises!"}
{"text":"It took two different people to finally start making my order. Got a steak sandwich. Microwaved meat and a little cheese. Didn't taste great. Didn't stay in me very long.   Can't say I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went to eat lunch at Port of Subs on Tropicana Ave. on Labor Day, Sept. 5, 2011 at 2:30PM and it was so bad that I felt obligated to write this review.  The woman behind the counter was in my opinion rude, and unqualified to make a sandwich, she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her by placing an order. I ordered a foot-long tuna sub with lettuce and tomato, she said is that it? and I said yes, but as I watched her make it, spreading the tuna on super thin, putting three tomatoes, and handful of lettuce I knew the the sandwich looked weak, but she wrapped it up and and said $5.40 before I could get a chance to say anything, so we walked over to the register and I just paid for it.  would you like a soft drink or a bag of chips to go along with that? would have been nice of her to ask, to which I would have replied yes, as a matter of fact I would, but it was clear this woman wanted me out of the store as quickly as possible, so I just paid what she asked and left. When I got home and opened my sandwich I discovered I was right, the bread was under cooked, and it tasted like a lettuce sandwich with a hint of tuna, I'm serious, she spread the tuna on like it was a condiment! it was the worst sandwich I have ever gotten from a subway shop!  I will never go back, and I recommend you avoid this place as well, not to mention the shop looked run down, old, and dirty, and to top all off, now I am feeling a little sick."}
{"text":"Port of Subs is one of my favorite sandwich shops. I always get the 12\" number 9, which is turkey and provolone on white bread. I add the mayo/mustard mix, lettuce, tomato, peperoncini, pickles, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and it makes for a delicious and filing sandwich. This particular location is family owned, and you can tell they care a lot about the store. The whole store was sparkling clean, from the make line to the tables and the floor. I will definitely be back when I am craving a sub sandwich.  Yelp 2015 Review #9"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich, quick service (it was busy so of course you're going to wait a little) but overall demeanor of staff was poor. The manager was pretty horrible to the other staff during the rush so it's no wonder why no one seemed happy or welcoming. Theres really no excuse to treat your staff that horribly, esp in front of customers. If they had someone in charge that make the atmosphere more pleasant they  would be 5 stars easily."}
{"text":"\"Hi. Hello. How are you? Be right with you.\" Any of these words could be used to greet someone when they come into your store. How unfortunate that I was not greeted at all yesterday 1/31/15 when I walked into this store. So I walk in, there is a girl making a sandwich, we will call her SM for sandwich maker, and she looks right at me but doesn't day anything. There is another girl who is at the register helping some guy, she looks at me too and says nothing. Eventually she is done helping the guy and looks right at me, and walks away. I stood there for a good 5 minutes without anyone saying ANYTHING to me. I was about to walk out, but luckily SM FINALLY said \"I'll be with you shortly.\" Still looking directly at the sandwich board, never making eye contact.   At this point, another lady has walked in to order behind me. Finally SM is ready, she asks us both what we want. Why?? We are not together and she knows this. So I tell her what I want and the lady also tells her what she wants, which happens to be 2 sandwiches whereas I am just getting one. SM proceeds to cut all of our breads and slices all of our meats and cheeses at the same time. Then she asks us what toppings we both wanted. What the hell! I was there first, waiting like a dumbass way before that other lady, so my sandwich should have been made first. I also should have been talked to directly instead of with this stranger. It was akward as we both were shouting out toppings and sauces. That pissed me off. Meanwhile the other girl is no where to be seen, but I can hear her chatting in the back. These business owners really need to think about the people they are leaving in charge to run their store when they are not there. The sandwich was fine, but the shitty employees running this place will make me not come back.  Yelp 2015 Review #24"}
{"text":"Great new store. Been waiting for it to open. Within walking distance of my house. Great service and fresh food. Check it out."}
{"text":"This is a decent lunch spot.  It is next to the Starbucks where I like to work/study, and so it is a quick choice...  The subs are good, fresh veggies (lettuce, tomato, pickle, olives, peppers...).  There are many options for wraps, even lettuce wraps, salads, and subs or grillers.  There are many options of meat and cheese.  They slice it right in front of you as you order.  Some downsides to this spot - it is a little slow.  I imagine this is because it takes time to slice the meat/cheese.  The person putting the veggies on is never very fast.... the sourdough bread is extremely dry (I suggest another option).  The pasta and macaroni salad is just \"ok\" in my opinion.  I also think that since they are cutting various meat and cheese right there - they SHOULD have a separate meat and cheese slicer.  I find it wrong that it is done all on one...  The prices are average.. I would go more often if it was cheaper, that's for sure.  Still, I have been here MULTIPLE times, and will continue to go here and there.  It hits the spot and fills the hole :)  The turkey/chicken/cheese combo is my fave, both as a sub or a wrap!"}
{"text":"Sandwich was really good.  I had the #13.  Manager on duty was a lil rushed and upset about something but service was good."}
{"text":"We walked in a half hour before the posted close time, the open light was still on. Online it said it was open for another hour. We were very rudely greeted with a yell of \"Hey! We're closed! Online it says we're closed now,\" and we're herded out. Lies. Everything was still on. At least if you're going to lie so you can leave early don't act so horribly. Worst port of subs I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite, can get busy during lunch time. Can order ahead. Live there grillers."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend, Happy their meat is sliced right in front of you. I hated my sub I couldn't even finish it. Tomatoes were soggy, if you have bad tomatoes why even put them out? The guy that was slicing meat was extremely helpful and joyful. He tried to help the guy next to him that was taking long to put toppings on an order of subs so he tried to help by topping my order of Subs but he was yelled at by the manager. The manager was extremely disgruntled, not sure why. Maybe it's because she works at a sandwich shop. Even tho I didn't like my sub my boyfriend loved his. Over priced, rude manager, gross tomatoes. No thanks, I won't be back.."}
{"text":"First, let's get out of the way that my husband used to work at this Port of Subs...and he raved about how fabulous it was....so I had REALLY high expectations. Unfortunately...I was not as happy with the experience as I had hoped. While I know that subway has it's issues...they have quite the variety. Port of Subs doesn't match up...not even close. I am an extremely picky eater. They didn't have the kind of bread options that I like...although they did have the cheese and meat options I like. Their veggie selection was a bit blah, but ok.....but the condiments....what were they thinking?  Seriously...is it too much to ask for a couple different kinds of mustard? They only had 1.....I'm sorry I insist on honey mustard...really I am...but is it really too much to ask?  That's really the only reason I couldn't give them a higher rating...they just don't have the selection I like. The people that work their were a little snobbish too. Maybe I don't understand because I'm not from AZ....and quite frankly I hate it there. I'm an Alaska girl thank you very much. Once you hit a certain temperature...what's the point? 115 degrees in the shade? Are you mad? So what if you think it only \"feels\" like 98....it doesn't change the fact that it's fucking hot! Who can even eat with temperatures like that? I thought the state was going to kill me!  Ok...enough of that....anyways....we're swinging back through...and I doubt we'll eat there again...but if you live in the area and hate subway (which apparently a lot of people do around there...) Port of Subs is a pretty good option. Especially if the employees are nice to you."}
{"text":"too much bread!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich. In the gas station. Guys were helpful and wanted to make sure we got what we needed. Thanks guys. Stop by if you need something quick"}
{"text":"Delivery of our catering was an hour and a half late after they rescheduled their delivery 2 times.  After being an hour late manager called and asked if we still wanted our order. Seriously? Yes, we want it people are waiting.  Owner said she was \"sorry\" when she dropped it off and it \"was a learning curve, won't happen again.\" Really? That's the explanation? She should have done something to fix it or make the situation better.   Pathetic attempt at customer service and good business practices/logistics. We will NOT be using them again.   Feel free to contact us."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Port of Subs for at least 20 years. This location has however been consistently horrible. Honestly go to the 215 Flamingo location as their service is top notch. Tonight I walked in and it was busy. They had 3 employees working with no sense of urgency. I finally get to the line about to order after 10 minutes of waiting. I place my order and do all my toppings. One of the employees disappears so now there are only two working. Instead of the employee who finished making my sandwich ring me up she assists the guy behind me as well (mind you he walked in just as I was placing my order so he had experienced no wait) and now continued to wait until he made all his decisions. Then she cuts up my order and wraps and I think \"OK\" she will ring me up now. Nope continues with the guy behind me again. It should not take 20 minutes in Port of Subs at 7:10pm. And needless to say there should be a sense of urgency to move through your line. I get home 5 minutes later and my sandwich is saturated in oil! Awesome."}
{"text":"This location has the best customer service I've ever received from a Port of Subs. The veggie/avocado sub I had was pretty good but nothing to write home about. I would eat here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this because I have never had a bad experience at a Port of Subs. However, this store became the exception to my rule this week. I went at lunch time so it was understandably busy but I wasn't greeted or acknowledged until I was served. I order the vegetarian sandwich. This is where my visit went downhill. This particular location only has one meat/cheese cutter--which means that the meat AND the cheese are sliced on the same machine--which means that even their \"vegetarian sandwich\" is going to have meat goo on it. BUMMER. This is a deal breaker for me but because I had already waited so long to be served I didn't have time to go anywhere else to get food. As I was checking out, I was charged for the avocado I asked for on my sandwich even though it states on the menu that it is included. The less-than-helpful cashier argued with me about it and at the end, I still ended up getting charged. Absolutely, positively will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Although the sandwich is very good, when your taking out you want them to work a little fast , the employees worked very slowed paced and my Italian griller is super flat not a little toasted but completely flat .... Not to mention the manager getting mad at her employee, I like a friendly environment when I go to eat somewhere"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying Port of Subs but was honestly disappointed. I ordered the regular or large size of the turkey and provolone. The sandwich was less than delicious. TINY portion of turkey that left me still hungry afterwards, even with all the fixings on top. It wasn't terrible, just wasn't exciting nor was it worth $8 or $9 in my humble opinion. I may have just ordered the wrong thing but based on my sandwich and the service, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would; they were rude, nasty, and the place was filthy.  They had ran out of tuna by 1130 in the morning!!!! The two people that were making the sandwiches had no customer service skills.  I love port of subs; there are other POS in the valley that are great but not this one stay away from this gross place."}
{"text":"I have 2 words Jamie and Jordan. what makes an establishment great to amazing? Customer service and these 2 made my experience great. First let me say this port of subs location is clean and and beautiful. Jamie helped in my indecisiveness and Jordan was great in ringing up my order. It's so refreshing to go to an establishment and have a great experience, my sandwich is delicious I got the hot pastrami sandwich. This is the place to go and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This location is great, I met Bill (owner) and Tennessee (the manager hope I spelled it right) the customer service was spot on. I had the #13 salad style with spinach and my friend had the chicken salad. The place is clean and the food is always delicious. I don't know why people waste their time going to subway.  Tennessee is an asset to the company she is fast, friendly and polite with a great attitude. If you are their ask her to make your sandwich or salad it will be worth it. Thanks for another great experience!"}
{"text":"Listen, this place is just... I don't know where to begin.   I ordered catering for my daughter's birthday party. We have ordered from them before with little issue. This last experience had totally changed that for us now.   I called on Thursday and placed an order for Saturday. The poor experience began on the phone and I should've known better at that point. I ordered 2 sandwich trays and after he (finally) seemed to understand what I was trying to order, he seemed in a hurry to get me off the phone with a quick, \"Ok! See you then!\" No repeat of my order or asking me if I wanted to add to it, which I did.   I told him I needed a veggie tray and a fruit bowl. I asked him to please repeat my order to ensure the I had not missed anything. All seemed ok.   Saturday rolls around. My dad went to pick the food up. We received a call at 1:15 asking where we were. I told them on the phone when I placed the order that we would be there after 12:30 that day. My dad was on the way and I told them that.   He gets there and finds 2 sandwich trays and a fruit bowl. No veggie tray. He called me and the rude gentleman \"manager\" gets on the phone stating I \"never ordered a veggie tray.\" I told him yes, I did. I continued to remind him of me stating I needed to add a veggie tray and fruit bowl. Back and forth- he is calling me a liar & continues to repeat that I must've forgotten to order it. I said no, I didn't; it seems that you must've forgotten to write it down. Still, no apology from him for the mistake. How hard is it to say, \"I'm sorry ma'am\"?   Anyhow, I will never return here for any reason and have already contacted their corporate office. The grapes in the fruit bowl were moldy, as well. Just lovely. If I could give a negative 5-star rating instead of a 1-star, I would. After this experience, I feel they don't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"Great food! So happy to have this sub shop close to home. Family owned. Great deals too."}
{"text":"Had lunch today here.. oh yeah, big ol' ham and cheese sandwich... It was way better then subways, and Quinoz.. at least the ones near my house anyways.  The shop was nice and clean, a little busy because it was lunchtime, but the workers were on their game and made those sandwiches pretty fast to get me back to work on time.  They had a special that is crazy.. 2 feet of sandwich, any cold ones for $9.99. So I split the cost and got a whole foot long for like $5. It's not the wimpy ones at other $5 foot long deals.. It was huge, had all the fixings, and I could only eat half of it.. So oh yeah, you know what I'm having for supper... MMMM... Can't Wait! good food, meat and cheese were nice and fresh, they didn't skimp on the toppings... good deal, I'll be back.."}
{"text":"I order a lot of catering for events at a Las Vegas resort. This Port of Subs is BY FAR the best team I have ever worked with. They go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need and more. I want to shout out two amazing employees who provide extraordinary customer service. Alfredo was able to accommodate a last minute request and was an absolute pleasure to work with. Also, Trevor went out of his way to ensure that we had everything in our order and his attention to detail is exceptional. I just want to say THANK YOU to the entire team at Port of Subs - Flamingo for all of your hard work!"}
{"text":"I Love this place.  So much better than that horrible subway.  I love the sourdough bun and any meat you like.  You might want to double up on the meat though."}
{"text":"Normally I don't write reviews for chain places like this, but the people who work at this Port of Subs location deserve to be recognized. Every time I've come to this location the staff is super friendly and helpful. Not to mention they make your sandwich super quick. It's not often I come across fast food chain places with great customer service."}
{"text":"This place was actually pretty good.  I love that they have sourdough and smoked cheddar as options.  I got the tuna on sourdough with smoked cheddar toasted...I know it sounds weird but don't knock it till  you try it, it was so good!  The young man that helped me seemed new, but he was super sweet.  We live pretty close to this location so we will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at the lovely Port Of Subs, I enjoyed a number one combo, kept it simple, and the 5 inch sub was decent, the mayo mustard mix had a very egg salad taste to it, which some find very good, after removing the sauce, the sandwich wasn't half bad! Prices are very low, a combo was only 7 bucks! Location isn't pretty, they sit alone in an empty plaza but other than that I give Port Of Subs a thumbs up"}
{"text":"I think the secret ingredient in Port-of-Subs sandwiches is crack. Seriously. I crave it every day but I've forced myself to go only once a week.  I don't understand the two star rating. This PoS is in a bad neighborhood, but is very clean and anytime I come in, the crowd is uniformed services workers (cops, firemen, mailmen, etc...) and the atmosphere is chill.  When I go (which is usually lunch, I work Downtown) there is a fabulous server who is always in a great mood, but not so over the top that it's annoying. Everyone I've encountered who works here is in a pleasant mood and works very quickly.  The best part about Port-of-Subs: unlike subway, their bread doesn't get stale while you're eating it. And you can get your sandwich grilled in a panini press, which I think is way better than toasting."}
{"text":"Food was ok. The service and vibes though.... it was a very weird place to feel this level of awkwardness. Orlando made our subs and seemed pretty friendly but it seemed like some problems between the employees are very evident. Carole was almost rude. We asked for water cups and chips since we don't drink soda and she tossed us our cups and said \"here's your water cups or whatever?\" We won't be back \"or whatever\"."}
{"text":"I always get the #1 here. I've never tried anything else. I can't move past the first choice. It's an Italian and it is amazing. The quality of the provolone cheese and deli meats used taste like it's from a butcher shop / deli. Actually I used to go way out of my way to get subs at a butcher shop and now I don't need to. The staff is friendly and expedient, and it's very clean there, so that's a real plus. But the #1. Well, it's #1."}
{"text":"I always get friendly fast service here! The guy that works there (I think is the manager....or should be) Always makes sure to get the other employees in the right spots to get the line moving and jumps in where ever his help is needed.   Fresh good tasting food!"}
{"text":"First off I would like to say, I feel like anytime anyone goes on yelp in the first place is to leave negative comments or to complain because that's just what we like to do as humans. Which is why I took the time to write something positive. Next, I would like to add that there are 5 others sandwich shops nearby that I absolutely love jimmys and cap being some of them. As a local in Henderson I have always admired the employees of this particular Port of Subs as I've been going here for years now. They are always so friendly. In addition, the owners (2 brothers) are the cherry on top for the customer experience. I admire both of them because they are always back there making sandwiches grinding the work shifts out with there employees. They truly inspire me as business owners. This will continue to be my go-to sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible. Dirty looks every time I asked for somthing. The girl taking our order asked probably 5 times what our order was. I felt like I was NOT welcome in this store. The onions were old the lettuce was old bread was old. Skimped on everything. These people working in here could literally not care less. Asked for new onions said that's all they had. Was about ready to just walk out. For some reason didn't I didn't want to be rude but what would it matter to these people anyway"}
{"text":"No smile for the customer. As if I'm bothering then when there was no one in the store. less meat than usual. I've seen them put so much stuff in the sandwich they couldn't wrap it. Today I think they were serving me about half of the meat than usual. Not a place to be back."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs when I need a quick lunch between classes.  They are fast, friendly and their food is alway very tasty!  I love that they really stack on the veggies!  Extra pickles on the side?  Of course!"}
{"text":"What's Subway?  This Port Of Subs is one of the best locations... Their customer service and staff is amazing.  Every time I come in here I am greeted and even during lunch times they handle the rush well.  The sandwiches I order always taste fresh and they have always gotten my order right.  With all of the sand which competition out there I would definitely give them a try. It doesn't hurt that there is a Starbucks right next door either!"}
{"text":"Food is average subs if you're looking for that kind of thing but their register does math wrong and overcharges. Rang up $24 for a $19.99 family meal. Employees are idiots and said that was tax. 20% tax? I think not...  Shady business practice...won't be back."}
{"text":"This was the best sub I've had in a long time! Fresh sliced meat, awesome sour dough bread and the service was top notch . Austin and his female co worker made our experience here some of the best service we've had in a long time! Well done!"}
{"text":"I REALLY like this place! It's my favorite Port of Subs location. It's clean, the staff is friendly and fast and the owner is very nice. He did some catering for our non-profit and really helped us on the food cost. I'm here about once a week or every two weeks. Always top-notch service. I LOVE the new flatbread! Quick lunch or dinner? Go here."}
{"text":"Freshly sliced subs and friendly staff, although this location is very slow sometimes because only 2 people are working, which means only 1 is making all the orders and the other is standing at the register as the cashier. I wait about 10-15 min before I could place my order! Didn't help that the guy in front of me ordered like 5 sandwiches at once! I ended up not having much time to eat and was almost late to work...only come here if you're not in a hurry and can take all the time in the world"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by my first visit here a couple of weeks ago. The staff was incredibly friendly and very accommodating to all of us who weren't familiar with the menu at all. Both employees wore gloves and washed off the knives and blades before preparing the vegetarian sandwiches without me even having to ask! The prices were a little more expensive than a Subway, but the sandwiches were definitely much better. It all tasted very fresh and much different than what any other sandwich store has to offer in the area. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Some of the employees here make excellent sandwiches and are exceptionally polite, the others...not so much. It's pretty hit or miss depending on who's working when you go.   I like Port of Subs, so I'm happy to have a location near my neighborhood, however I wish the service were more consistent. Both my boyfriend and I have been skimped on veggies so many times, and it's really a frustrating issue when it happens on so many occasions. For me, a sandwich is more about the layers of vegetables and the delicious seasonings with a highlight of cheese, not the other way around, so when I'm offered a few measly slices of tomato it's a little insulting.   I'm not a high-frequency customer because there's also banh mi and salads up the street, so I only find myself motivated to eat here once in awhile given the competition."}
{"text":"The sandwich was excellent. The bread was soft...just the way I like it!!! Yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty sandwiches just like any other Port of Subs location. When I went over the weekend, however, this one was a little slow because only 2 people were working, but there wasn't a crowd of customers either so it wasn't too bad. Still got my food in a reasonable amount of time"}
{"text":"I am a fan of big and tasty sandwiches but have had very few really good ones as of late. That is until I tried this place. I was in the area and decided to give the them a try after spotting their sign. When I first walked in I noticed the place was empty (normally a bad sign) but it was a Thursday afternoon so no big. This was my first time eating here so I took a few minutes to see what they had to offer. The sandwiches here come in different sizes from a small 5 inch to a 2 foot extra long, which makes it easy to decide what to order depending how hungry you are.  The 8 inch sub is easily enough for one really hungry person or two not so hungry people. Seriously it is about the size of a subway foot long and taste way better to! You have three choices when it comes to bread. They are white, wheat, and sourdough. I chose sourdough for my sandwich and it was chewy and seemed to be really fresh. Like most sub shops they also have a selection of pre selected combos (18 to be exact) with toppings like Ham, Turkey, Pastrami, Salami, Capicolla, Roast Beef, and Tuna. The cheese selection includes Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar & American  What makes this place so different from most sandwich joints is the fact that they hand slice your meat when you order it. No more slimy meat that has been sitting in a case for hours and floating in weird juices Yuck! Finally a place that understands that it is OK to take the time to slice meat for each customer because it makes for a better tasting sandwich. One that a customer will want to come back for over and over again  For me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place. It is not often that a place is able to make such a great impression on me (read my other reviews) but I will definitely make sure to give them my business the next time I am in the mood for a sandwich. The only thing that brought their score down was the fact that they had no customer parking and I had to pay to park in the garage. Yes I understand it is Tempe but why not at least offer to validate my parking LOL."}
{"text":"This Port of Subs has some great specials right now- on Saturdays, 2-foot longs are $10.99 and Sundays, all cold footlongs are $5. You can't beat that with a stick!  Now on the sandwich hierarchy, I'd put Port of Subs above Subway any day. As good as Port of Subs is, it still isn't Capriotti's.   This particular location is one of my favorites - it's always clean and very rarely crowded. There are lots of tables and a clean bathroom."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service I will never visit this location again. Went in to get a nice dinner and there was one order ahead of us and we waited 20 min before leaving and I would have been if I would have gotten a \"hello how are you ?\". Or even one moment please ... horrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Port of Subs is my favorite sandwich shop hands down! I started going here for lunch when I was at ASU. I love that they have so many different sandwich combinations, some with meats/cheese I had never thought of to try together. I appreciate that they have Sourdough bread and sliced cheddar cheese which competitors rarely carry.  Everything here is sliced fresh right in front of you. The veggies are always fresh and crisp too, the bread is soft and chewy, etc etc. It smells nice and you won't leave with that weird sandwich smell attached to you.   The customer service at this location is pretty good. Even during the lunch rush, the line moves rather quickly. They have plenty of outlets and USB ports, too. The only thing that is somewhat unfortunate is that they don't have a customer restroom."}
{"text":"We were hungry after shopping and saw Port of Subs. Love them and decided to get some lunch. William and Carly were working and were very friendly. William was especially helpful and outgoing! Our sandwiches were yummy as usual. They have a new Marinated Cucumber Salad. Decided to try it. It was delicious.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is not well organized!  After I waited for eight other groups of people ahead of me I ordered a #5. which is ham turkey and smokey cheddar.   when I got home it was turkey and provolone.  didn't think I had to watch the older guy slicing figured he'd know what he was doing.  Then I turned in my punch card for my free 13th sandwich. and they tell me those aren't valid because they switch to a points system.  while they were laughing at me  They told me they'd give me 60 points then charged me for the sandwich that was supposed to be free.  .  I get it that I haven't been for a while as there are many choices to eat in henderson and I don't always want a sandwich but it was their program. they should honor it. The new system is $5 after 100 points.  they couldn't have given me the 100 points to at least get $5.00 off?????   I'll never go back again!  No wonder that other sandwich store is one of the fastest growing chains in the US.  I'll just go there.  Thanks for helping narrow down my choices Port o Sub!"}
{"text":"My visit today was amazing there was a little line but it moved so quickly the two people working was so fast and kind at the same time. When I asked for pickles I got what I asked for which made me happy. Thank you for a great experience"}
{"text":"port of subs.....   sliced meat fresh in front of you to edge them out over subway....  They have changed their menus since I have last been in there....   I ordered a small Blackforest Ham with provolone on Wheat with spicy mustard... it was great and exactly what I was looking for for lunch.  I think the price was sub 4 bucks too which was also a bonus.   There was kind of a long line and it was understaffed considering the time of day it was (lunch)    all in all, it was a great experience and I would go back to this particular one again should I need a quick bite."}
{"text":"The owner was a big f jerk today when I brought both of my grandsons in for lunch ,please try to have some respect of people when you have a business.the food was just ok. Service sucks"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food here is awesome. The reason this review is only 2 stars is because of the service. I have ordered pick up or delivery from this location at least 15 times during the past 2 months. The employees are nice people, but their delivery service is horrendous. Nearly every delivery has been missing 1 of 3 things. 1) The delivery person has no change for a $20. 2) They forget the chips. 3) They get your order wrong (like today, when I order the same thing every time). This is the reason I have been going elsewhere lately. Hopefully they can improve their delivery services."}
{"text":"I'm here twice a week with my kids. Best Port of Subs I've ever been in. They always know my order and the staff addresses us by name. So great."}
{"text":"This place is Vegas' best kept secret. I'm late writing this review because I was there a month ago. However,  as I sit in my home in the DC area it makes me sad to know I can only get this on the west coast!! The sub I had here was amazing! The bread was to die for! I look forward to my next trip, just to get another sub!"}
{"text":"When I didnt have some many requirements for where I will  eat I used to eat here. The sandwiches are really good and the onions are sliced really thin, the pickles are sliced filet stylr. The toppings are way fresher than its competators.   Good sammies cheap. Better meat too they slice it right there"}
{"text":"Walked in and it felt/looked clean.   Order a turkey with American on wheat bread. Added olives, banana peppers, lettuce, tomato, their mustard & mayo spread, extra red onion, oil and vin, and oregano. Their meats and cheeses are sliced right in front of your face. Thin slices of meat but a hefty portion and soft sand which bread.   Customer service was decent and prices were average. Would definitely come in again!   Now go get a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for yrs! Well over 4yrs because the lady at this place has seen my son grow.. Clean and nice place to eat and I will always pick this place over others .. When I have the choice ha.."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, Port of Subs is one of the few fast food/casual dining type places I can/will eat at. I looove a veggie sub from Port of Subs.   They slice the cheese (and meat) here, it's much more appetizing than the cheese/meat you see sitting there at Subway and other sandwich shops.   The main bonuses here, other than fresh slicing, are the sourdough bread and pepperjack cheese (never know if other sandwich shops have either of those), and first and foremost the mayo/mustard mix. I always get a ton of it. The only reason I took one star off my review is that lately, the mayo/mustard mix tastes a bit different (although that may just be my taste buds??), which was, honestly, the main draw for me, so I find myself coming here less often.   I also really, really appreciate that they clean the machine before slicing the cheese for a veggie (#6) sandwich here. They say it is their policy to do so, but not every location does so...and I have learned to make sure the machine is cleaned first, after I got a sandwich with some slices of meat on it from another location. I appreciate that they do this without my having to ask (esp. since I always feel a little bit bad asking them to take the time to do so, esp. @ lunchtime, when this location gets crazy busy).   Also love the frequent customer type card, buy 12 get one free! Always makes me happy to get a free, delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"A very good sandwich at a very good price. Fed a family of 3 for $30. All the ingredients were fresh and the customer service was great. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here and the lady who was making my sandwich was apparently off work...because she left it sitting on the counter before it was finished and just walked away without saying a thing. The guy who ended up finishing mine was nice..but her attitude is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple of weeks ago.   I got a meatball griller and my wife got a ham, salami, capicolla, and provolone sandwich. They were both good.   It seems like the owner cares about the shop because there were little extras in the decor like a magazine rack and autumn decor which I haven't seen in other Port of Subs.   On the downside I saw one of the workers picking her teeth. No customers came in after that so I didn't see if she washed her hands before the next customer. Either way it wasn't real appetizing. I am going to give the benefit of the doubt and assume she did wash her hands and give 3 stars as the sandwiches were good."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sandwich chains in my area. I think they are better than Subway. Deli sliced meats and soft bread. Mayo/mustard is a must!"}
{"text":"Another visit, this time eat in. I got a medium number one (Italian at other places) with four meats and one cheese, plus drink and chips for $10.   Everything is always sliced fresh, as you order. The bread was fresh, the veggies crisp and with plentiful meats.   There were 11 drinks available from the fountain and a dozen more in individual bottles. There were at least a dozen flavors of chips to choose from.   The staff at this location were exceptional. As I ate in the half-full place at 11 AM, listening to their 80's music, it was clear the the manager, Megan, treated her crew well. They were skilled, engaged the customers and were efficient in every aspect. The restaurant was clean and comfortable too. Well done!"}
{"text":"Waited 15 mins to get a sub with very stale and small sourdough bun.  Then they overcharged me.  I like Port of Subs typically because of the fresh-sliced meats and fresh bread.  When the bread is hard, even Subway is better.  Will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"This place is absurdly clean it is honestly one of the cleanest restaurants I've ever been in. The BLT and Italian or bomb"}
{"text":"Always good and quick service when I come in here. Seems to be clean and neat when ordering to go.  Never dined in always take to go. Friendly staff and quick with orders."}
{"text":"Felt like grabbing a sub, and remembered that Port of Subs is right down the street.  Walked into the shop, which a bit of line had formed, no big deal.  Well, the staff was a bit busy chatting with the family in the front to help everyone else out.  I understand customer service and all, but chatting with a family for 5 minutes while a line is growing is not good customer service. Finally had my sandwich made and while I was walking out, I heard the lady who was cutting the meat talk to another customer about how she had woken up this morning coughing, sneezing, and with a sore throat.  Really lady? Safe to say I didn't eat the sandwich."}
{"text":"First time at this Port of Subs but have been a regular for over 30 years.   I arrived at 11:40 AM on a Tuesday and there were 10 people eating and another seven in line, which moved quickly. I ordered a medium hot pastrami and a bag of chips for about $9.   My sandwich was piled high with pastrami,  cheese and fresh veggies. There was a choice of about five cheeses, 12 veggies, four spreads and good shaker options (oil and vinegar, etc.)  The bread is always baked fresh in-store and mine was soft with a perfect crust.   I highly recommend Port of Subs. If you like hot sammies, try the hot pastrami. For cold lovers, the number one is a fave."}
{"text":"Been going to Port of Subs for 39 years but my first time at this one. I ordered three party platters and 30 bags of chips for the following day pick-up.   The online ordering system is easy, once you set up an account. There are as many choices available there as in person.   I arrived 15 mins early and they were just finishing my order. Everything was there but the chips, which they let me pick out.   Once I got everything set up at work and everyone dug in, I realized how bad the sourdough bread was. People were making dental jokes, which put my reputation at stake. Overall, most liked the lunch (cuz it was free) but those who had sourdough sandwiches were greatly disappointed. It was extremely chewy, nearly to the inedible point.   Too bad since I always have liked the variety of three kinds of bread.   Next time I will skip the sourdough.   Update:  Definitely service issues at this location. I was third in line and still waited 15 mins. They got most of the way towards my lunch, only to inform me that they ran out of pepperonis. With only two toppings (mustard and peppers) it completely changed my sandwich. Go to Costco around the corner if you need to!  Then I got stale bread. Poor location here."}
{"text":"This is easily the most friendly location! It's also clean and bright.   There's such a huge difference between a sandwich with fresh-sliced meat and one with meat that was cut sometime last week in a factory somewhere. Port of Subs reminds me a lot of Submarina, for those of you from California.   My favorite thing about this place? You can make any sandwich a salad. Best part? The employees at this location are not surprised at the request for a salad and they know how to do one right!"}
{"text":"New office, new selection of lunch places! This was my first foray into Summerlin for lunch at work and I'll very likely be back.  I'm a huge Port of Subs fan, since it's the closest thing to my beloved SoCal Submarina. The fresh-sliced meat, the mustard/mayo combo, the excellent sandwiches, the wonderful fact that you can make any sandwich into a salad.  Now for the gripe: I'm all for friendly employees who greet their regulars by name. This place has that in spades...but too many spades! No customer should have to wait longer for their food because an employee is having a long, personal conversation with a customer. My poor lettuce sat, waiting for it's toppings, other orders piling up behind it, for far too long, waiting for this little chat to be over.  I think I'll call my order in from now on, so that I can avoid the line completely."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. My favorite chain sandwich shop, for what it's worth. They offer sourdough, which I guess is too exotic for Subway and Quiznos. I also like the service here. The sandwich makers here are fairly friendly and though I'm sure you can only make so many subs before becoming overly jaded, they don't seem to show it at all.  It's a little pricy too, but it's good stuff."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches tasty freshly sliced, excellent service and prices!!! Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"I order online, stop in, pay, and I'm out in a jiffy! Easy and affordable. The number 10 is good!"}
{"text":"I like the food and most of the staff is usually friendly, but there is one guy who tends to ruin the experience because he always seems to have an attitude; the short guy behind the counter. Maybe it's the Napoleon complex or something, but I won't be returning to this location for a long while."}
{"text":"Okay I would just like to start off by saying I've been coming to this location for over a year and I have never had a bad experience. Employees are always friendly and efficient, but today I went to get a sandwich for my boyfriend on his lunch break at 10:30 and the store was closed. The store hours say this location is open at 10. There was an employee inside the store but he wasn't unlocking the door and there were two other customers standing outside waiting. I didn't have time to wait so I went somewhere else to grab food."}
{"text":"I have always loved Port of Subs & have recommended it to people for years. Today I tried calling in an order for pickup and the owner was the one helping me over the phone. I wanted to use coupons and the owner accused me of trying to \"take advantage of the system\" which I was not. After trying to discuss the situation with him I finally said that there are a lot of sub places in town & if he continued to be rude I would take my business elsewhere. To which he replied \"Go ahead and take your business elsewhere then.\" I love the food at Port of Subs but will no longer be visiting this location."}
{"text":"This place is close to work so I've been here a bunch of times. It's always fresh and reasonbly fast. The sandwiches just have a really good flavor. I think that they taste better than Subway."}
{"text":"I've been going to Port of Subs for 40 years, buying hundreds of good deli sandwiches and have never been treated so rudely as today.   I ordered a hot pastrami on sourdough for dinner. The roll he used was old, shrunken and below par. I immediately asked for a different roll but the manager said that it had already been cut. Really? I told him to look at it again and he said it was fine.   Unfortunately he then moved to the cashier station. I offered my 'frequent customer' card for payment, since I had three free sandwiches piled on there. He paused and then said: \"Uh, its only good on cold sandwiches.\"  I challenged him on that, while the rest of the crew withdrew, obviously noting that he was wrong. Clearly he did not intend to honor the card.   He then became belligerent, whereupon I walked. Sad that such a strong franchise gets ruined by a greedy manager."}
{"text":"This is the best Port of Subs in town. Perhaps, anywhere!! The care and attention to the product they put out is clear with every order!"}
{"text":"Now, I've only been here a handful of times but all were great experiences with really nice people and better food than the majority of similar places. I had never been to a P of S prior so didn't really know what to expect. The staff there was helpful, kind, and accommodating when I didn't really know what I was trying to order, haha. And it has always tasted great!!  Note to self: go here more. It's a nice place with reasonable prices and good staff. I'll snap some pics next time. But just go. You will like it."}
{"text":"Love how quick and easy this location is! I pay as they're making my sandwich so I can get into and out quick . Also such amazing workers & management, always smiling faces & great service !!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are great could use fresher foods but the service is great very nice people"}
{"text":"I visited a port of sub for the first time today. I went through the drive thru. The employees did not address me at all. I could see through the window that 2 employees were working. I asked the employee if they could hear me just to make sure the intercom was working since no one had spoke to me. The employee  Laura told me to give her a few minutes because she had a order that she was completing.  I sat there and waited for 15 mins. Laura never came back to the intercom to take my order. I had my newborn in the car so I did not want to get out. I honked my horn to get her attention. She came back to the intercom and asked me to give her a few more minutes. She never once asked what I wanted or even addressed me as a customer the whole 20 minutes I waited in drive thru with my baby in the car. I asked her who the manager was and if she was on duty she told me no. I asked how to reach her and she proceeded to tell me I can call tomorrow. Never once offering her assistance or asking what I would like to order. As long as there are employees like this working here I will never return. I will be sure to contact management tomorrow when they are in as well."}
{"text":"Super nice, clean, fast and friendly!! I wont go anywhere else! I always love a clean restaurant and when the food for the sandwiches are cold and fresh. This place is fantastic!  Staff is super friendly as well. Excellwnt quality and taste!"}
{"text":"DIRTY! DIRTY! DIRTY! Every time I come to this port of subs it's a little worse every time. Let me start by saying that your staff is actually very nice. They were trying to move the line as quickly as possible and they apologized for the wait. They were all working hard to get to the customers. I'm going to say that the problem here is the management. Every time I come in here there is always new people. I couldn't even finish my sand which because as I waited in line I noticed all the dirt. The whole place is dirty, dust everywhere. The ovens have a ton of dust bunnies which with the AC in here I'm sure fly into the food. The edges of where you keep the Coke are also full of dust and dirty.  The final straw for me was when I saw a dead cockroach on the floor. On top of that your floors are also black like they haven't been moped in a while.  I hope this review doesn't fall on the staff rather than the actual problem which is management & upper management. You can't expect people to do a good job with out the good training and tools!  To the staff working on 05/20/2016 around 1:30 you guys did a great job. I noticed your hard work. I hope you get the training and tools you need to succeed.  Thank you for your customer service. I'm sorry that your management has failed you."}
{"text":"I really like port of subs.  I recently found them because of their service to Bike MS.  That charity work and good food was amazing. Thank you for fighting multiple sclerosis."}
{"text":"I've been eating Port of Subs since 1977 - seriously. They have never let me down for a quality sandwich, pleasant service and good price.   I've been to Subway, Jimmy John's, Jason's Deli, Firehouse, Jersey Mike's and all the rest. Port of Subs slices the meat to order and piles on the toppings.   I recommend the hot pastrami or the number one which are my usual go-to sandwiches. Give them a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! Love the big menu, the cashier was a little weird, the manager Darryl was great, very friendly.  I'll be a fan forever!"}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Not as nice as the Summerlin one, It was during a bit of a lunch rush. I felt bad for the staff, one lady was really rude (a customer) but the employees did their best with her demands.  Next in front of us was a space cadet looking chick, she pulled out a list of 6 orders, SO annoying! She couldn't read the hand writing of the peoples orders so stood there, called everyone and then go annoyed that the staff wasn't \"working fast enough\"   When it was finally our turn to order, bread started to burn, so instead of making arrangements to her fan to blow the smoke out, she just opened the oven, smoke filled the room and made everyone's eyes water.  My wrap was made in haste, it was sloppy and came unwrapped. My husband's sub turn out okay. We'll be sticking with the summerlin location from now on."}
{"text":"My sister likes their sandwiches because the meat and cheese is sliced when you order. Great unless you choose to have cheese without meat juice all over it! I thought there was a health concern with slicing dairy cheese in the same slicer as meat.  They may have a decent sandwich but not for me.  I will not eat at Port a Subs for that health concern."}
{"text":"So, I come here all the time for lunch since I work in the area. Usually everyone is very friendly and they listen great. Today I came in before work and ordered my usual, #8 white toasted. I asked for it toasted 3 times and the girl looked at me said yes and didn't toast my sandwich, as she looked at me while she cut the sandwich and wrapped it. I didn't bother reminding her because I was irratired.  Just for future reference listen to your customers.  Amazing food but staff needs to listen."}
{"text":"surprised by this place. YUM! I doubt I'll go back to Subway again. service was fast too. added oil vinegar salt pepper. that's the way to go."}
{"text":"Great subs, slowest service. Why is only one person working? And why have I been standing in line for 10 minutes without even a hello!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few port of subs before and this one was by far the nicest! Super clean and very friendly service. Sandwich was fresh and was delicious!! In and out with fast service. Will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Fucking terrible. Walked in and was greeted with a very unwelcoming acknowledgement. Very rude employees, slower than molasses, food handling was absolutely horrendous, food not worth with is charged it's just subway with a different name. Bullshit sub shop never returning."}
{"text":"UPDATED AS MARCH 13  The corp office called me and we had a VERY Nice conversation about the issues. They seemed very understanding and willing to fix the problem. Apologized, sent me gift cards and most important: THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM. The week after they called me I went to the store with my boss and we had zero problems. According to him they had a problem I believe with short staff some days but they fixed. Excellent customer service. That's what makes a good place (other than the good sandwich and staff, which I mentioned before that they had!). That's why now I am reviewing them again. Way to go, Port of Subs! Thanks!   The sandwich is good, staff is nice but if you have one hour lunch you are screwed because it takes then SOOOOOOO LONG to process the payment. I've been in line for 20 minutes now and the lady is still trying to figure out how to charge a pickup order for someone else."}
{"text":"Utilized Port of Subs catering for a Graduation Party for my wife who got her Masters.  Port of Subs Knocked it out of the PARK!!!!!  Amy did such a great job on all the platters we got, and there were a LOT!!  Every thing tasted amazing, the fruit was so fresh and tasty...thank you so much Amy and gang!!!  YOU ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good; nothing special but OK.  Bread is a little better than Suway's, but not as good as Quizno's.  Filling such as meats and cheeses are of average quality and amounts, and may seem slightly less in quantity than some of the other places since their \"large\" sub is 12 inches.  But with a discount coupon it is pretty good and I have no complaints."}
{"text":"We picked up a pair of sandwiches on the way to A's spring training and it was definitely better than what The A's were offering inside."}
{"text":"I just couldnt have any worse time while i was there. I was given the wrong change and then they argued to me about it for an hour and then I found the bread to be old and kinda flaky."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite to eat before a meeting. I was pleasantly surprised that the calories were listed, and that I could get a sandwich that was exceedingly high in calories without an exorbitant calorie count. Service was quick and pleasant."}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment before but on September 11 around 630, there was no one on the register to take my order. I waited for 5 minutes and even called for someone but no one responded. Never returning here again.  Update: went back again to see if it got any better and it didn't. Found a piece of hair at the end of my sandwich. They should be wearing hats or something to prevent this from happening. Horrible"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the freshest tasting sub sandwiches in the East Valley, this is the place to go.  Their menu consists of all the standard sub combinations you would expect to see, but their claim to fame is they actually slice the meat and cheese for your sandwich AFTER you order it....it doesn't get any fresher than that!  The place is clean and the staff was inviting, and it's located right off the 202.  My only complaint is the portion size of the meat and cheese is a little weak.  I typically order double-meat, double-cheese, when I order from here to make the sub taste \"right\" to me...and that makes it a bit pricey overall."}
{"text":"I thought I would do one of my comparison tastings. Today, I stopped by and ate here and ordered the 8\" number 7; which to you and me is a medium roast beef sandwich.  This evening I'll try Jimmy John's on Scottsdale Road.  The wait in line was nil since the place was empty when I arrived just before noon. The folks behind the counter seemed friendly enough and took my order. The wait time from ordering to paying was about two minutes.   The sandwich bread was generic soft white sub, nothing special. The roast beef was shaved and reminded me that when I get old and lose my teeth, then this is the place to come. The sub ran $5.79, plus $1.59 for a small drink, with tax the total was $8.07.   I would say my original impression that: \"Port of Sub is really good, not great, but really good\" was generous.   I believe the sub was bland and they didn't have anything interesting, except for banana peppers and shaved lettuce and tomato to put on it.   So, I'm revising my rating to two stars instead of three. Yelpr'er Kelly B. might be closer to the mark then me and her review is nearly five years old!   So, in the future I'll pass on Port of Subs!"}
{"text":"I am reviewing the sub side as I have never tried the Smoothie King's offerings but I can say that their counter is always busy.    The subs here are offered in various sizes on fresh bread and made to order in front of you.  One complaint I have is they smash the living daylights out of your sub when they cut it.  The meats are sliced as you order and the veggies are pretty fresh.  The indoor seating here is very limited but they have a decent size outdoor patio which is really useless 4 months out of the year.  The parking is pretty tight and gets pretty hectic at lunch time."}
{"text":"Since we were in a hurry, we ordered online for a 9:15 a.m. pick up of our sandwich. Arrived at about 9:35, only to find out the sandwich had not even been begun,. I don't know why somebody would have an online ordering system where nobody pays attention. I cannot believe that they have the nerve to even ask for a tip. I am updating this review as the rest was written before eating the sandwich and just reflects not having our order ready as requested.  The sandwich was fantastic, even after we hauled it around for 3 hours the meat was plentiful and veggies were fresh. Derek"}
{"text":"I love this location! The employee David is so great that I put up my first yelp review. He was friendly and knowledgeable. My family and I talked with him the whole visit! He loves his job and his company. Great to meet a loyal employee!"}
{"text":"This is the CLEANEST, most CARING sandwich restaurant I've EVER been in! I call it a \"Restaurant\" because they treat YOU and YOUR FOOD as if YOURE IN A 5 start Restaurant. You get the feeling as if they're making your food for a loved one... Every sandwich is made with LOVE. They really won me over, and I'm sure anyone else who comes here. The station is clean ALL the time and the hospitality is always warm and inviting. I will forever be a loyal customer to this place...."}
{"text":"Ew.  Their bread is stale much of the time.  Their meat looks a little ill.  Their cheeses look like they've been sitting out too long, ditto with the mayo/mayo-mustard they slather on everything.  The veggies are limp, their pickles frighten me, and I get generally anxious any time I see a Port of Subs worker using the meat slicer.  My sister used to work there and I know what state of mind she used to be in.  I worry someone might lose a thumb.   I remember a time when I though Port of Subs was the best sammich place in town.  I wonder if they've just gone downhill or if my tastes have just grown up.  Regardless, you won't see me here with a Jimmy John's 10 minutes away."}
{"text":"I have loved port a subs for years, ever since living in Las Vegas. The staff at this location are great, they remember their customers and are very friendly. This is definitely the place to eat fresh, take that Subgoaway!"}
{"text":"Tried the #2 ham, turkey provolone sandwich on wheat bread (small) and portion was just right. I like that they have the option for getting the sandwich on a wrap, flat bread & wheat/white bread. They also slice their own meats so that's cool! I give this place 3 1/2 stars just because they didn't have much options for toppings I'm used to seeing a plethora of options like Subway. I wasn't offered vinegar or olive oil so wasn't sure if that was an option or not. The sandwich itself was tasty and you could taste the quality of the sliced meats and cheese so 5 stars for taste. Overall a great lunch or light dinner idea. Prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad but they are INCREDIBLY slow and inefficient. Last time I ever come here."}
{"text":"I've been ordering sandwiches online to this location for a few months now, and I've gotta say.... The entire team here is amazing. They all greet me with high energy excitement every time I come in and they all know me by NAME! It's just awesome to have that kind of service at such a casual place. My food is always done right and it's fresh fresh fresh!!! I honestly don't know if I can go to another port of subs and feel the same way I do at this one. I don't think I've ever been treated this way at any other casual lunch place before. It's just awesome and I give these guys 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"All three stars are for the food - no complaints there.  My sandwich tasted really fresh and the small (5\") was surprisingly filling.  It's nice that the meat and cheese are sliced to order rather than sitting out in a slimy tub.  Plenty of different toppings are available and they are applied quite generously.  They also have a huge smoothie menu.    Unfortunately, the service was pretty bad...  I was left wondering whether there's even an interview before you can work there.  The guy making the sandwiches was so slow it still took forever.  And both workers I dealt with were practically non-verbal.  Everything came out as a quiet mumble, which was slightly frustrating."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs and continually brave the slow service at this place because the subs are so damn good.  The bread and other ingredients always taste fresh - they actually slice the cheese to order rather than picking up a pre-cut slice packed in wax paper.  And I love that they have avocados (mushed up like guacamole) as a topping at no extra charge.    I do have to take off one star for the service because let's face it, it kinda takes forever. The guy doing the bread, meat, and cheese is always ahead of the game, taking orders from way back in the line.  But the dude putting on the toppings gets totally utterly backed up - we're talking 4-6 bread/meat/cheeses sitting there waiting.  I'm thinking they need two people on the topping line, or maybe just one person who can listen to what you want the first time you tell him and remember it long enough to make the sandwich and send you on your way.  One can dream..."}
{"text":"This place is really good, I eat here once or twice a week because I work in the area. Its affordable and great fresh food. Its very clean, they mop like 3 times a day and the employees are the nicest of any place I've ever been. Ask for the \"UPS special\", its a breakfast wrap with egg, turkey sausage and sliced chicken with barbeque sauce and provalone. Its the best wrap you'll ever eat."}
{"text":"Most locations are usually the same but this branch's lettuce tends to always be soggy and the bread either over cooked or old."}
{"text":"I have seen a few of these sub shops around so I decided to stop and check this one out.  The food it's self was nothing special.  Fresh cut meats and cheeses, fresh veggies except the avocado it had some brown spots on it.  They did not cut them off... That was not the issue here at all though. The service was far from great. There were 6 associates working at the time I came in granted it was right at lunch time, there were 3 people in front of me and they seemed to be working on a online order. I understand, but I stood there for about 10 min as the line behind me continued to get longer and longer. There were two associates just standing there looking around one actually grabbed the tip jar and started counting their tips.  I'm sorry but I will not be back because the speed in this place was NOT THERE! And in a sub shop like this the wait should not be that long."}
{"text":"We put in an online order for pick up and it was not complete upon our arrival 20+minutes after submission.   The place was a ghost town and nobody came to the front immediately. The male working said they were \"swamped\". Um... again, NOBODY was in the place. Not only that, the girl working just sat there and giggled as he explained how BUSY they are. (GHOST TOWN...like I could HEAR the crickets.) My overall impression was that flirting with the girl is more important than his job. I just hope he's not her manager.   They made the sammiches while we waited. (WHAT is the point of ordering ahead if you cant have it ready?) Sub par.  We wont return to this location."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs but this location has really gone downhill over the past couple of years. The workers are never consistent and they barely give you any toppings on your sandwich regardless of what size it is. I order the same thing every time and it always has a different amount of meet and barely any toppings you have to continually ask for more. The store also needs a really good deep cleaning. The tables are always dirty and the floor always looks like it hasn't been vacuumed in awhile. The location on Val Vista and the 202 is much cleaner and more consistent."}
{"text":"Always a great sandwich to be made here. The people are so friendly I always go to this location.   Today I ordered a large veggie delight sandwich on white for my mom and a small turkey and pepper jack cheese for me on wheat. Mom loved her sandwich as much as I did. Will be back again for another possibly next weekend."}
{"text":"I don't normally take the time to write a bad review, but this place was SO bad I felt compelled to. I don't even know where to start. The bread was hard and dry, there were flies all over the place, including on the sandwich being made next to mine, no one seemed to have any organization (the person making sandwiches just walked away mid-sandwich making), and when I finally got home to sit down and eat, in my first bite, my mouth was filled with plastic, one of the fine workers apparently forgot to take off the plastic cover from the meat. So each of my salami slices had lining of plastic - YUM!! I didn't even both to eat the rest, just dumped it in the trash.  In the past I've always liked Port of Subs (different locations besides this one) but after my experience today I will never eat there again. There are so many other choices in the sandwich business these days, don't waste your time with this place!"}
{"text":"I was at this Port of Sub's at 12:30pm on 12/1/2016. The lady and gentlaman running the counter gave exceptional customer service. They were friendly, approachable, funny...everything you want in someone who works in customer service (which I have worked in, in different variations, for 20 years.  They both gave the restaurant a great upbeat vibe.  The sub's, of course, were delicious...but the customer service was top notch!  Thanks guys!  We will be back"}
{"text":"Tomatoes looked disgusting and why don't they carry ketchup? Isn't this America? I hope this microwaved breakfast griller tastes good..."}
{"text":"This location catered a business lunch today for me. Food fresh and tasty. Terrific value and service.Yum I highly recommend using them."}
{"text":"I've been to this port of subs quite a few times and usually the service is pretty good, but yesterday the service was poor and I got an incredibly sloppy sandwich. Half my sandwich wasn't inside and the outside of the bread was covered in may/mustard."}
{"text":"I really like Port of Subs, but this location is the worst! The owner/manager totally rips customers off by using the smallest portion of all the ingredients I've ever seen. He will scrap mayo and the mixed sauce off the bun like he's using caviar. The larger the sandwich the more he spreads out the meat so it appears it has filled the bread, but it's just an illusion. He rations pickles, olives and tomatoes too! I can't handle it!! I will never return. He has done this too many times. Just go to the location off Warner and Val Vista - this guy is the sandwich monitor. And all his employees seem to fear him, they may need help, and be afraid to ask."}
{"text":"Sadly, this restaurant appears to be going downhill. The cleanliness of the restaurant the last two visits is disgusting. On this visit, someone had spilled something so the tables were moved and the mess remained...nobody ever came to clean it. Restrooms disgusting, outdoor tables were not set-up and no cookies were available for dessert. Seems they are understaffed.  Hope you get your game back on or I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is too expensive for a sub. I know you're in the airport terminal, but come on! $10 for a sub and and extra $3xx for a medium drink and bag of chips... I don't think so!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is pathetic. $10 for a tiny flattened, microwaved sandwich and a cup of \"coffee\". Both are by far the worst of each i have ever had. Save yourself the aggravation and just starve. At least the staff was friendly. Just a horrible product."}
{"text":"I placed an order for Super Bowl Sunday and when I went to pick it up it was ready and the sandwiches were delicious ! They even helped me with the tray out to my car. I will be back ! Thanks to everyone at Port of Subs on Durango and W. Flamingo"}
{"text":"Port of subs is one of my faves, but honestly the employees at this location need some serious help. Granted they're incredibly nice to me, they seem to lack training completely. I feel as if this is a management problem more so and I think it needs to be fixed because it's a mess."}
{"text":"I went into port of subs and had a fairly large order. Right as I walked in I was treated as if I was a nuisance to the employees time. Almost all of the vegetables/condiments were out of the cooler browning on the counter so I know that they had been that way for awhile. Also condiments were missing and told that there was no more ripe avocado. As seen in the photos there was not enough counter space for our food so sandwiches were placed on top of the tongs and left on the slicer. Also, while making a wrap the scraps were thrown carelessly on the ground. There was nobody else in the establishment the whole time we were there yet we were treated as if there were 15 people in line behind us. I go to port of subs very often. Sometimes multiple times a week to enjoy a fresh sandwich which I sadly did not receive at my visit today. I will not be attending this location again in hopes that my overall view on one favorite restaurants will not be ruined."}
{"text":"If I want a chain style sandwich I would opt for Cheba Hut.  This place is just okay.  Not much better than Subway in my opinion.  Nice that they slice the meat fresh.  I thought the sourdough bread was a bit hard and stale tasting.  The avocado was browning a bit.   No fresh brewed tea.  I thought the sandwhich was a bit pricey even with no drink, chips, salad, cookie, ect.  I don't intend to go back."}
{"text":"I stopped here tonight because my favorite sub place just over the freeway, AZ Sandwich Co, was out of bread. Never again. This place cost almost twice as much, and had about 1/3 of the meat. The bread was chewy, and the toppings didn't look very fresh."}
{"text":"Smallest salad with the least amount of meat I have ever seen on a salad. I got double meat and it probably equates to 1oz... Spend your $12 elsewhere. Trust me!"}
{"text":"Found this place on my Yelp mobile app!  Came in for lunch on a weekday after hitting up the outlet mall. We were about to head home from Vegas. The shopping center was busy but we were lucky and found parking right away. We seemed to hit the end of a lunch rush because a) it was about 12:45 and b) there was a line, but you can see it was moving quickly. Let me just say that the folks who worked at this store were hustling! They worked well as a team, each doing their job and getting the customers helped and out the door. No wonder so many people came in for lunch. I ordered the Turkey Avocado Bacon sandwich and the hubs got a Tuna sandwich. We both got chips and drink. The ice in the soda machine was out and within seconds one of the female employees was coming out of the back with a big bucket of ice to fill it up! I think they were having ice issues though, another employee came in with bags of ice from the store so perhaps this is something that doesn't occur often. Once most of the customers left after being helped, the employees who weren't directly with a customer were cleaning and stocking the store. It was great to see such strong work ethic in a sandwich shop. The food was great too! We both thought our sandwiches tasted great and we ate them up!   I am only bummed that there isn't a Port Of Subs close to my home. Vegas is too far for me to drive for a sandwich.  Overall: Great food & great service!"}
{"text":"I like the Turkey Sub, with extra pickles! They do a great job! I love how they carve the meat and the cheese fresh when then they are making your sandwich.  Add a few hot peppers and a nice cold drink and you have a great lunch! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is a good place to est they have good service and they make good subs in my opinion this is one of my favorite place to eat at they have good bread and my personal favorite is the meatballsub"}
{"text":"I love port of subs, it's a really simple sandwich, but to me it's always a good choice and never fails. Every location that I have gone to has the same great customer service. It never takes long to get your food and the prices are good. If you want something to have that is quick and not too bad for you, port of subs is the way to go. My favorite it the number 1 and the ham with smoked cheddar. They also make fresh delicious brownies and cookies. There bread is also made fresh and you can smell it when you walk in."}
{"text":"I just ate here and while the food was good, I was very disappointed in the way the older female worker treated the younger male worker (perhaps newer). She was yelling at him and being very rude bossing orders left and right. You could tell she was causing him to get flustered. While I don't want anyone to get in trouble or fired it would be great if this could be addressed with her so she doesn't do it going forward. She could also be nicer to the customers as the moment we walked in she immediately snapped and said, \"one minute\" and then when I tipped her the change .75 she didn't even say thank you."}
{"text":"Love coming to this location because I've always had a great experience. Tables are always clean, even at its busiest , the times I've gone it's always clean. Great customer service. The staff is always extraordinary & our orders are always right. Rather come to this one than the one closest to our home."}
{"text":"Very clean, modern, and kind staff. Time efficient and orderly, I was impressed with how quick we got in and out before my shift. Thank you, I will be coming back a lot more now. First time, and I'm glad we found you."}
{"text":"Amy, Alyah are the absolute best!!! Everytime l go in I'm greeted with a smile and a Warm hello. They make the best sandwiches and make me feel like this location is always the best choice! Thanks ladies!"}
{"text":"Food is always good been twice in the last few weeks but the manager is so rude he should even be in the customer service industry"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying this location is normally fantastic. The food is good, it's clean and the staff is on top of it here. My son and I come here a lot. I've never had a bad experience with anyone here until today.  I just had surgery and decided to use a local food delivery service for the first time today and picked Port of Subs because I feel I can count on them.  I had my usual order (1 veggie combo and another veggie with a bag of chips, no drink). When the delivery came some of my order was missing (no drink and only 1 bag of chips). The delivery girl apologized and said she'd be back with the rest of my order. She also told me to call Port of Subs and let them know what happened. I called and talked to Jamie (she helps us all the time and recognized me). She apologized and said she'd get it ready. Apparently, there was someone new working on orders.  While we were waiting, we started eating our sandwiches and they were covered with avocados. Gross! We did not order avocados (did not check \"add avocado\" which is an extra charge). I called Port of Subs again and this time got the new girl. The following interaction is what prompted me to write this review. Instead of apologizing for messing up my order she got an attitude with me. \"So you didn't want avocados then?\" If I wanted avocado I would have ordered avocado. She acted like she was doing me a favor for giving me avocado. Just because I'm ordering a veggie sandwich doesn't mean I want avocado on it. Also, the correct thing to do when you not only forget half of someone's order but also make it wrong is to apologize not get snotty. Clearly, this girl needs more training.  When the delivery person returned our order was correct and our sandwiches were delicious. Thank you Jamie for making it right and for being so nice and patient with me!"}
{"text":"Love Port of Subs and so happy that we have one in Phoenix proper! Their bread is delicious and their mayo/mustard combo is a must. They also have sliced pickles which makes the sammich.  So much better than the Quizno's that used to be here.  I will be back and hope you'll visit too, I want this to stick around!!"}
{"text":"Staff here is very friendly and the place is clean.  The staff is relaxed and fun. Iv only ordered a few things from here...so I can't say their food is amazing.  The 2 or 3 subs I order are great. Close to work. Clean. Fun friendly staff. Tasty food. Easy 4 star review."}
{"text":"Came during lunch and of course it was busy. But the employees behind the counter were friendly and very attentive. One employee in particular, I think her name was Skylar, was very friendly and polite. She said it was her first day, but she seemed to be doing a great job! Keep up the good work! I'll be back for the pastrami!!"}
{"text":"The customer service is AMAZING but their sandwhiches are made commercial ready!!! I have visited  other locations but they didn't compare. My feedback would be for surronding stores to be consistent with the level of customer service and the amount of pride shown when preparing the sandwhiches. Great job North Durango!!!!"}
{"text":"So today was my first day visiting a Port of Subs; not just this particular location. I must say, the chain impresses me but this location was just \"meh.\"  Assuming the food is the same at every location is the same, I'll be returning to others. I mean come on, they have sourdough and smoked cheddar. That can NOT be a bad thing. My sandwich was quite tasty as well. I imagine the fresh cut meat helped... or at least gave the illusion of helping!  As to this one... well, I asked for \"the works\" on my sub... twice, getting a confused look both times, before I waved my hand in front of the case indicating everything. After this point I was informed that the sandwich maker had \"never heard that before.\" Alright that's not so bad in itself. But my co-worker ordered a chicken salad... and the chicken was immediately stuck in the microwave; then a couple minutes later, he was asked if he wanted it hot or cold. When he said that he would have preferred cold, they pulled another bucket of chicken out only to realize that they store their chicken frozen. So they had to heat the chicken in the microwave even more to make sure it was thawed.  Like I said though, impressive food, not the most impressive location!"}
{"text":"I liked this location a couple of years ago but not anymore. Ordered the turkey and roast beef on wheat. It was dry and the beef tasted like bread. The banana peppers tasted like nothing as well. I don't think I'll be going here anymore...."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect since this port of subs is in a dingy shopping center but it was very clean and modern and the food tasted very fresh. I love that they slice your meats at that moment. They have wraps unlike at subway. The only thing I didn't like was how slow the service was and that the lady drowned my sandwhich in mayo even though I said light mayo ;-; but I think she was new so I guess its ok. Also it is a bit pricier than subway."}
{"text":"Excellent service !! Very good sandwich, all ingredients fresh & prepared as requested (condiments & veggies on the side). Way better than many franchise sub places.  Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and freash meat. Get a family pack to share and enjoy 2 feet of perfection.   Add chips, cookie and a drink and then head to the Zoo or botanical gardens.  Join the sub club and earn free food."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, but always under staffed. I tried online ordering and that was a missed as well. By the time I got to the restaurant, they haven't started making my sandwich."}
{"text":"Love this port of subs location! The employees are always friendly, it's a clean environment and always receive great customer service!!! Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Port of Subs in all of Vegas & Henderson. This is a store were the owner is present every time. You can tell he really has a passion for his company and what he does. This really shows when he interacts with all of his customers. In my experiences, it is rare to get the level of services that the owner and his employees give to their customers everyday.   Thank you to the owner and the staff for providing a great experience every time I eat there. You have a customer for life!  Josh"}
{"text":"For sandwich chains, it doesn't get much better than this. They slice the meat and cheese right in front of you, bake the bread in house, and they keep their veggies fresh and crisp. They offer what are more or less the standard options for meat, cheese, bread, and toppings, so what separates them from the competition is the quality. The meats are all fantastic, resembling the cold cuts you would get at a legitimate deli rather than those from a fast food sandwich shop (like Subway for example). This is about the only corporate sandwich place that I trust enough to actually order the tuna salad. The cheeses are also quite good, and they offer smoked cheddar as an option, which is sheer genius. Bread options are a bit limited compared to some places, but it's always been soft and delicious, with just enough tooth to it to be satisfying. The exception to this is the sourdough, which I find to be a bit too dense and chewy a bread for a sub like this. The toppings choices also offer nothing unexpected, but they are generally fresh and tasty. Usually, they give you a pretty good helping of the meat and cheese, but they are often a bit stingy on the veggies. You can hound them for more, this gets annoying for everyone involved. Still, given the price, it's one of the best options out there for a good sub."}
{"text":"Used the app for the first time and to my surprise it was very easy! Only thing is on the app their is no where to enter your rewards card but when I picked up my food the cashier gave me my points. Sandwich was ready on time and made to my order, recommend the #1."}
{"text":"This Port of Subs in Surprise is top notch! The staff is always super friendly & knowledgeable about the menu. The food is always fresh and the bread is fantastic! I would definitely say that this is the cleanest restaurant is Surprise! The counters, tables, drink station area and floors are spotless! It's so nice to go into a clean restaurant and eat. They definitely take pride in their workplace here. Others should take notes...        Every time we have been in this Port of Subs the owner, Michael, always makes a point to visit each and every guest in the restaurant making sure their food is good. Thank you for the great food and great service!"}
{"text":"I was next door to this place eating and parked in front of Port of subs and when I came out from lunch the owner of Port of subs came out and yelled at me for parking in front of his business and was very rude and upset that I didn't eat at his location instead I went two the neighbouring business very unprofessional and very rude and the bad part is is that I've eaten there numerous times over the last few years but never again will I go back two this man's place"}
{"text":"Subs here are delicious and very reasonably priced! I love that they have a small option that is less than $5 and perfect light lunch size. I would give 5 stars no doubt but there is one problem... the staff always makes me feel so rushed and unappreciated, the first time I came I walked out before ordering because the guy was such a dick :( pro tip: be nice and smile!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well since I literally work up the street from port of subs I decided to give it a try because subway on alma school and queen creek is always packed and I wasn't a fan of planet subs on Germann and Dobson. Looked up their menu before I went on lunch to get an idea of the food and saw they had a 'pilgrim griller'. Turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce all on a piece of bread? UHM yes please. I basically cram my thanksgiving dinner into rolls anyways (bread is a great vessel for shoving large amounts of food into ones mouth) so it would be like a little thanksgiving dinner for me.   Walked in at 1 pm on a Thursday. Only one guy sitting there and it was nice and quiet. Ordered my pilgrim on sourdough with provolone, lettuce, *thinly sliced* pickle, tomatoes, olive, peppers and pepper. Took one bite and fell in love. The combo of sagey stuffing with the thin turkey and veggies and the sweet cranberries and tangy (fresh) sourdough bread definitely hit the spot! I got a medium which was HUGE. More than enough food if you order chips and a drink too.  Overall not a bad place for lunch that's close to work and pretty cheap on the wallet and I will definitely be back for the pilgrim (damn limited time only bs)!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this port of subs.Willams and Carla greeted us and got started on our orders right before it got busy. They handled it well and got us great food with great service. While they were cleaning up and restocking after the rush they asked us how we like our meal. They were chatting it up with us while they cleaned the place. William even gave me suggestions for my next sandwich. Awesome job so I had to post a review."}
{"text":"Worst ever me and my daughter went in last week in the evening.  The service was not good at all we were not greeted. The 2 girls  working were not friendly at all. We ordered a number 5 and a turkey  bacon ranch wrap the sides were not fresh they seem hot when there suppose to be cool. When I worked there we got scolded for that. It's not how it use to be. I think they need new management in there. Don't think I will ever go again."}
{"text":"I love this Port of Subs! I have another Port of Subs closer to my work, but I drive the extra mile or two to come here. Damon, the Owner, is such an awesome and upbeat guy. He knows me by name, and greets me every time I come in the store, and does the same for many other customers while I am there. The store is always super clean, and is newly renovated, so I like the new style. The sandwiches are the best, on par with any other Port of Subs I go to, which I love. The reason I keep coming back here, however, is the friendliness of the staff, and I hope that never changes! Definitely gives a hometown feel to this huge chain of a restaurant, which I love being part of a community. My favorite place to eat, hands down!"}
{"text":"I called in an order they put me on hold for 25 minuets. About 15 minuets later my daughter goes to pick it up and they said it was going to be 30 minuets. 30 minutes to make two sandwich????"}
{"text":"Fast service and helped get my meal right as I was heading out to work. It's a great spot to grab food especially if you are on the go and in need of a good sandwich in the area."}
{"text":"Just got the most excellent service I've ever had at this location from Trey and Kayla ( hope i spelled those right!) They were in great spirits and took extra time to make the sandwiches perfect and even mentioned the port of subs member card where you get a point for each $1 you've spent. I was just here yesterday and plan to be back tomorrow ! :D thanks guys keep up the great work !"}
{"text":"I only order the #4 on sourdough and it's amazing! Every time I order its fresh, bread is soft and the sandwich spot is clean. Plus the staff is always friendly. Make sure you sign up for their rewards, I have already gotten a free sandwich and $5 off."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service I've ever seen. It happened to me more than 3 times here I give up not worth it. The girl managers attitude is terrible (very rude) and it wore on to the staff. I asked nicely to please toast my sandwich twice and the employee hist at me then I tried to just ignore it but when she asked what I wanted in the sandwich was a rude tone I said just forget it. I walked to the manager and told just forget my sandwich your employees are not to nice she said ok, never asked why, what happened nothing.  I left  couldn't believe it so I looked up yelp and now I see the problem it wasn't just me this is been going on for a while the corporate office in Utah just doesn't care it's Summerlin they will make  money no matter how they treat you."}
{"text":"New peeople there dont seem to make sandwiches as im used to. Meat slices thicker like subways and sandwhich was super thin. I would rather give 3 stars but I know if I had a different person I wouldve gotten the service i was used to. The woman said she was the manager but totally made my sandwhich based on how She wanted not how I wanted it.  I will drive down to the Charleston and rainbow location from now on where the owners work out of. The sandwiches there are more of what im used to port of subs being like."}
{"text":"This place is turning out to be my favorite sandwich place, the #4 on sourdough is tasty and filling. Make sure to collect your points on their rewards card."}
{"text":"First timers and YUM! Why didn't we try this place before? Plus they have sourdough bread! Try the #4 you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"POS is so good! So glad we tried this sandwich place, better then most other sandwich shops. Plus they have sourdough, yum which is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty regular here and most of the time right before they close.  The staff is always super friendly.  The food is always amazingly fresh even at closing.  The bread is amazing.  The meat and cheese is sliced when you order.  The sandwich spread (mayo/mustard) just can't be replicated I've tried and their selections can be made into salads and flatbreads which is awesome for variety.   Try getting your sandwich stuffs on a salad sometime.  It's delish!   Who knew?!  The interior revamped recently has some super comfortable couches and chairs now that I warn if you sit too long you may never get up.  Plus some tv for entertainment while munching lunch, dinner or afternoon snacks.   All in all this location is fast, clean, friendly and any time of day or night fresh and delicious.    Only down-side is they close fairly early so watch your time if you are hungry and its late.  You may miss out!  Highly recommend.   See you there!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches at this place are amazing! We come all the way from California to get them. Even grab some on the drive home. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I came here on 3rf of July around closing and they had run out of bread, the manager was really nice though and gave us a free sandwich on a port of subs card. I've been back in here since and must say the sandwich artist are excellent and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"Ordered online, the service was incredible they really took care of me and made sure that I got everything that I was looking for and that I was satisfied. I really enjoy the location and the level of quality that they offer and look forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"First time I've eaten here ordered #16 and it was great!!!  Great bread and great fresh flavors, I'll be back again!!"}
{"text":"I genuinely don't understand the reasons for such poor reviews from other Yelpers. Maybe they just came on off days, but every visit of mine to this Port of Subs location has been positive.  Granted, you're not getting a gourmet sandwich, so don't expect such. The subs are decent. Very average for a place like this. The meat and cheeses are always sliced fresh upon order, and the veggies are always fresh.   I always get the chicken Caesar salad and my boyfriend always gets a large turkey sandwich with cheese and mayo. The meals are enough to leave you full and maybe even take some home.   The service is friendly and personable. We come during the afternoons for lunch, and the older woman who works here is honestly a delight. We're in about once a week and she's memorized our order and always greets us with a smile. In my opinion, this is great customer service. The owner is usually always here and interacting with customers and/or on the line making subs or smoothies. This is also a plus in my book, as it shows an interest in the business.   We'll continue being patrons to this Port of Subs."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place more than Subway. I would rate it 5 stars except I wish the meat balls were always kept warm in marinara sauce. There were a couple of times that I arrived home and my daughter said the meatballs were still cold in the middle. The service is a tad bit slow at times but overall, we still enjoy this place."}
{"text":"LOVE this sandwich shop!!!! The meats, breads and veggies are always fresh and the service is excellent :)"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is they are open early.  I used to work an early shift and my lunch was at 10:30am.  It is hard to find lunch being served quickly at that hour, but this team is great.  I have had a variety of sandwhiches and take advantage of the sandwhich, chips & soda special each time.  The ingredients are fresh and everyone always has a smile.  It really hits the spot for a sandwhich lunch."}
{"text":"When I think of the first time I ever went to Port of Subs, the one thing that stood out was that whatever choice of meat you order they cut it into thin slices right there in front of you. Kinda makes you feel like you're at a local deli shop. I asked what was good and they recommended number one on their numbered menu. This was ham, salami, capicola, and pepperoni. I chose to have it on sourdough with all the fixins. I also had the bread grilled which made it taste even more awesome!  The fact that they slice the meat makes it taste really fresh. When you go to Subway, their meat is already sliced and their chicken breast is a processed by product. Once you have a Port of Subs sandwich, Subway will seem to taste just a little bit more bland. To me Port of Subs tastes so much fresher.   Sizes: Small 5\", Medium 8\", Large 12\" or X-Large 2', served on a white, wheat or sourdough roll. All sandwiches served with lettuce, tomatoes, purple onions, oil, vinegar and spices unless otherwise requested. Pickles, peppers & black olives available upon request. Cheese selection: Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar & American.  Overall service, cleanliness (especially the bathroom), and friendliness all receive high marks. For more info on this great company, check out their website.  www.portofsubs.com"}
{"text":"Came here on a Easter Sunday only because every other sandwich spot was closed. I have been to other Port of Subs and they usually dont disappoint. Well this one really disappointed.  Me and my 12 year old son ordered an Extra Large #1 which was a 2 footer on sourdough and the wifey ordered a Medium Avocado Turkey and Bacon which was 8 inches on sourdough as well.  The #1 has Capicola, Salami, Ham, and Pepperoni with Provolone Cheese. The Avocado Turkey Bacon was exactly that. We had them put everything on both sandwiches like lettuce, onions, mustard, mayo, etc.   The major disappointment was that the bread for both orders were dry, which was too bad because it kind of cancelled out the good taste of what was inside the sandwiches. I was only able to eat half my sandwich since I didnt really find it too appealing.  Service was nice and friendly. I was glad that they were open while everybody else decided to stay closed.  In closing, I have had a sandwich here before but the bread was never that dry. Hopefully, the next visit will yield a better experience and if so I will change my rating accordingly.

{"text":"It's best subs place in Las Vegas, it's also the safest in Las Vegas. The employees give great customer service. Their subs are healthy and fresh, I've never issued with this subs before, and so far it's never let me down so I continue to go this play twice a week since I can't resist my urge to crave some delicious sandwiches. Their store is always clean and always quite."}
{"text":"Been going to this store for a few months now. My fave is #5 the team here always makes a great sandwich. They know me and my sandwich when they see me coming I recommend this location a great stop!!"}
{"text":"Consistently fresh, clean, and friendly.  It's busy during lunch because they're right next to a Honeywell building, so set your time expectations accordingly.    PS flies come in from outside when the door is opening and closing as much as theirs does, deal with it."}
{"text":"I love this port of subs. I usually go for dinner and the same shift manager is always working. She's great, very friendly and patient when you can't make up your mind. We have a good chat every time I go.   Not only do they have great service but their sandwiches are excellent as well. Freshly sliced makes all the different in the world. I also feel like I'm getting a fair share of meat on my sandwich unlike other sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Horrible experience the chubby girl crystal is just plain rude an won't greet anyone that walks threw the door. Also she seems to have a major attitude for no reason. Very poor customer service an that's a shame"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick lunch. It's a little bit better than Subway for around the same price, and close to a lot of office buildings and next door to a Starbucks."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs!  Good bread and I like the way they slice the meat and cheese in front of you.   Ingredients are always good.  #13 all day long!"}
{"text":"It's not the best sandwich but its better than subway..."}
{"text":"This is by far the best and nicest port of subs I have been to. I placed a large order for a business meeting and they had it ready, bagged up, and totally accurate and on time when I picked it up. The staff was fast, friendly and the manager was awesome. The corporate office should use this store as it's model for other locations. The store Manager needs a raise."}
{"text":"Best Port Of Subs in town. Always fresh. Their party platters are awesome and very reasonably priced. The manager Amy and crew is awesome and will take good care of you."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this location. Every time I come in I feel like the customer service, quality and selection is lower. I use to come in once a week and now I refuse. I will drive a little farther to get better service.   *staff* they are too busy having their own side conversations, they can't make a simple sandwich order. I always have to repeat myself several times because they don't simply listen.   *food quality* lately when I come in the  whole wheat bread is harder than a crouton.  You don't even need to toast your sub because the bread is so stale. Don't get their sourdough! It's always as hard as a rock, and that's if they even have it in stock.  I also use to love a side of macaroni salad with my sandwich but it's always dried out and the noodles are literally hard to the bite.  I've always loved Port of Subs sandwiches so as a company I'm still a fan but this location needs to step it up. Train your staff and keep inventory up. It's disappointing when you are out of meats and breads. That's the minimum of a sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"I like to think I live on the edge when it comes to food.  I will really try anything.  If you have ever tried Balut, then you know what I am talking about.  I know what your are saying, how is this guy talking about balut with a sandwich review?    I am saying this because when it comes to port of subs I am not adventurous at all.  In fact I get the same sandwich every time.  I get the #5 Smoked Ham, Turkey & Smokey Cheddar Cheese.  Yeah I know it's crazy, I mean there are 2 smoked items on this thing!  Ok I'm kidding, but I'm not.  I have to say I love this sandwich because it never disappoints me.    Port of Subs is that sandwich place that you always forget about and then realize you are missing out.  They have slicers set up so you know you are getting fresh cut meat as you order.  I really like their patented mustard mayo combination. (I think it's patented.)  This is such a mind blowing idea to mix the to condiments together!  The veggies always look fresh.  Overall they are tasty sandwiches.    If you are in the area check this place out.  It is a little tucked away in this strip mall.  Watch out when you are driving it this place because I have dubbed it the parking lot of doom.  When you go you will know what I am talking about.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I visit this location frequently and I have to say that this time I was really shocked. The new skinny girl with dark hair obviously doesn't value her job. She needs to check her attitude and should be reconsidered for employment."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid. I've been to this location a handful of times and the service is always fast and friendly. The subs are pretty good. I just wonder how they pay their electric bill because this place has always been dead when I'm there. I mean 4 visits and so far I have yet to see anybody else here besides myself and my friend that was NOT wearing a Port of Subs uniform. Seriously.  But that makes for a quick service with no wait :) so I hope word doesn't get out too fast!   I'll be back and I'm sure one of these days I'll actually see somebody else in here besides the guy making the subs."}
{"text":"Bumping it up another star again. I have to say that this place is growing on me. I find myself coming here more and more lately. As much as I still enjoy some other sub chains, this place is a really solid option for more \"traditional\" subs. The prices are good, the subs are tasty, and (4 out of 5 times) the service is good! The young lady who was working earlier today was very friendly and professional!  I have been meaning to do this for a while now...so without any further ado...  4 stars!  Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The owner of this establishment is honestly a disgrace to the port of subs franchise. They have such quality food at every other location but the manager at this one rarely has any staff. & the staff they do have is VERY slow and VERY hard to understand and have a hard time understanding what you even want on your sub. Also, some days they won't even have fresh avocado which means they probably aren't being preserved correctly.... Disappointed in what this establishment has become"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing people run this! This has to be the best Port of Subs in Las Vegas! Baby soft bread. The freshest ingredients!  This is the best sandwich I ever tasted at a Port of Subs. I got the number 18. Roast beef and turkey. Sooooo freaking good. I'll be back even if it's crazy out of the way :)"}
{"text":"This Por of Sub location only is the only I will go to. Friendly staff and when I have a complicated order they happily fill it. I love the number 18 roust beef and turkey is soooooo good."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see so many good reviews on here.  I had a really bad experience.  The pathetic sandwich I had, little bag of chips & drink -paid over $9.  I wanted to say \"where's the beef\" but I said thank you, got out of that place as fast as I could and did not look back.  Not sure if it was an off day or what...but the staff seemed downright rude & the food portion was ridiculous.  I would say I would go back based on seeing some other good reviews, but quite frankly...I know I will not ever return."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've ever had at a Port of Subs. My avocado was black, there was very little meat or cheese and they didn't know how to put oil and vinegar on the sandwich. I spent almost $19 dollars when I could've purchased a better sandwich at the grocery store for half price. I highly recommend not eating at this store it was by far the worst experience I've had at a Port of Subs!"}
{"text":"My son ate here yesterday got some serious food poisoning.  He got sick within an hour of eating his sandwich and has FINALLY fallen asleep, almost 24 hours later. . Poor guy was up all night sicker than a dog....the only thing we can think of was the mayo was bad...... We will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Love Port of subs go there all the time up in the Northwest stopped by at this location felt like it was the biggest inconvenience for them to take our orders. Absolutely no eye contact very unfriendly I asked the woman if she was OK and if she was happy she smirked at me. If I was the manager at this Port of subs I would fire her immediately will never go back there. That's sad because the food is good but service is everything."}
{"text":"So I've lived in the area for about 6 months now and drive by Port of Subs on a daily basis as I get off the freeway.  Never really thought to stop in because I thought it would be the same ol' sub chain type place you're used to like Subway, etc and I'm not really a fan of the chain sandwich places.  However, I came to find out that this is Subway kicked up a notch!  First, I was VERY pleased to see the sticker in the window that they have a new tuna melt griller sandwich.  YUM.  That's exactly what I wanted, and it's exactly what I got.  It was quite tasty.  I'm not sure what the cheese was, but it was delish.  Plenty of tuna and put on all the fixins I wanted (like jalapenos, mmm, my mouth is watering).  I loved that they had a \"medium\" option (small = 5 inches, medium = 8, large = 12).  The line was HUGE and since this place isn't really convenient to get into (kind of an akward spot right off the freeway) I'm assuming that all their sandwiches are tasty to get that many people lining up for them.  Hubby got a cold sandwich (turkey & pastrami I think?) and liked it too.  Now that I know I can get tasty wiches here, I'll be a regular here for sure.  Only complaint, a \"little\" pricey for a sub (like $6-7 for a medium) but I think it was still worth it.  p.s. they have breakfast sandwiches!  Interesting..."}
{"text":"1st off I just want to say that i do actually think the food here is pretty good tasting, regardless of how brown the guac looks.  My problem is the service, everyone who works here is either lazy, dumb or a combo of both.  At Subway they at least pretend to be helpful, here they ask you the same questions over and over (ex. I have been asked what toppings 4 times and I only had 3 things added so really...) and still mess up.  One particular time my friend got a roast beef sandwich and half was roast beef half was pastrami, how is that even possible!?  Either way if they dont shape up they should change their name to Port Hole because its run by a bunch of As*holes."}
{"text":"Love their salads! Yes, I order salad at some sandwich shops and this one never disappoints. You get you choice of 3 greens and top it with whatever sandwich fixings you'd like.   Today I picked up a salad for my customer and myself and she too was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.   Service is always fri badly and prompt.  Bonus: they deliver M-F if you need it."}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! I placed an online order for a 6 foot sub yesterday and picked it up earlier tonight for a birthday party.   It was so easy and hassle free and the employees I dealt with were so professional, accommodating and helpful. I had a couple of special requests and they called me to confirm them and actually helped me out by suggesting an alternate way to accommodate my request that ended up being way better.   When I picked up my order, the sandwiches looked great, were presented well and the super nice guy behind the counter helped me out to my car. The sandwiches themselves were delicious-soft bread, fresh meats and cheeses and all the condiments we needed.   The store was clean and very well kept. There is a really large dining room, complete with a big screen TV and a couch (how cool!) to sit on while you enjoy your food.   I'm so impressed with this particular Port of Subs, it's food and employees. I highly recommend them and will remember this store in particular for future office lunches, parties, etc."}
{"text":"Food was delivered fast and accurate! They kept me in the loop when they ran out of anything and called me to change order. Great service and good food"}
{"text":"Why can't I quit you?!  A sub sandwich chain making it to the great wide open of Yelp? This still sort of baffles me, but those days of busy bee - go-go-go are in full force. Sometimes you just need something in your belly so you can keep moving.   This Port-of-Subs location offers the same thing that every Port-of-Subs location does. What does make this place special is the speedy and courteous staff. You can walk-in and there might be a long line, but it moves and within minutes you're constructing a tasty sammich.   I only go here during the week so I can't speak for the weekend, but this a quick fix to fill your belly on the go."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lot of room for improvement. First they closed their drive thru without putting up a sign. I sat there for over 5 minutes waiting for them to answer. When I finally came in they said they closed the drive thru. They didn't even put up a sign. Then they were out of hot pastrami. This was a bad experience. The gorl didn't even apologize. Subway will be my choice next time."}
{"text":"I love port of subs but every time I come to this location the same sandwich artist seems like she always mad and makes my sandwiches horrible and sloppy. You're also better off going across the street to Walmart and buying a whole avocado cause they only give you two pieces."}
{"text":"I had to review this Port of Subs because they are always so quick and friendly. Since it's a franchise, you never know what you're going to get and I've received some pretty horrible service at other locations.  This one is awesome!!!! It's true they don't honor the loyalty cards, but they always greet us with smiles and we are in and out in a jiffy!"}
{"text":"I would go to this place all the time when I came in from california. They don't have #portofsubs out in The OC. When I do go in the staff is generally friendly but the food is what I come here for. Today they closed about 10 min early on a Sunday. The tall, skinny, guy with the goatee said he couldn't sever me.. Even though it was 5:50pm. I went to the Starbucks next door, got a coffee and a sandwich and while sitting in my car I noticed 4 other people go to portofsubs and pull in a locked door. All within a 10 min period before 6pm.   I just wonder what the business owner would think about these kids closing early?"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of their subs, they have always been fresh and tasty. I do have one complaint on the \"Chicken Caesar salad\" which I had ordered awhile back. To be honest it was a pathetic excuse for a Caesar salad. First of all my chicken was heated in the microwave which was a little unappealing and the texture was a little off. Second, there was no croutons, no parmesan, and the lettuce was a shredded iceberg/romaine mix. To top it all the dressing wasn't a creamy caesar dressing so I was 100% disappointed with this salad. I would have named it the Plain Microwaved Chicken Salad."}
{"text":"I've been in this location a couple times and it is always very slow. The first time the worker was very professional and nice.  However yesterday the girl behind the counter was not so professional. She did not look very clean, shirt was about 4 sizes to big. All around sloppy.  The veggies laid out looked old and the lettuce warped a bit \"/   The manager has been in both times and is very nice and professional.   Overall I will probably return but wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Tasty sandwich.  The guy behind the counter knew how to use a knife, quick service"}
{"text":"A sandwich shop shouldn't get 5 stars, but this is easily the BEST Port of Subs in the city - they deserve it.  The crew here, managed by David, is tremendous.  They are funny, warm and friendly, and quirky in all the best ways.  The sandwiches are always tasty, which is not something you get from most Port of Subs.  Having this location in the same lot as my office makes life really simple, and I really enjoy going here.  David is usually there keeping the machine running smoothly, and he always has great commentary about life and work, but especially his crew.  Stop in and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sandwich is amazing customer service is awful. Crystal is rude and unprofessional. She gave us attitude immediately. AND SHES THE MANAGER. Going to start driving to a different location just to avoid the service! Sad sad."}
{"text":"Had a half price grand opening coupon. Wasn't worth it at any price.  The sandwich was TASTELESS"}
{"text":"Well, it isn't the young ladies fault but when I ordered a Pastrami sandwich and she went into the cooler to get a pre measured styrofoam cup I knew I was in trouble. If you're going to charge $8.00 for a Pastrami sandwich, you should put a good amount of Pastrami in it. What I should of done was Cancel my order when I noticed the Pastrami.  Very Poor."}
{"text":"While I always enjoyed the POS sandwiches at this location other customers and myself had some issues with the demeanor of the staff, but mostly with the manager. I found the staff not friendly, and the manager down right rude to her staff and customers. As a result I had dialogue with POS corporate on a couple of occasions who finally addressed the issue. The manager has been replaced and as a result the staff has come around in a very positive manner. It is refreshing to now come in and see people smiling behind the counter and saying good morning/ good bye, etc......can now recommend this POS    as a great choice to go for your subs!!!"}
{"text":"It's a sandwich place, nothing fancy.  They do slice the meats and cheeses when your order which is a nice point, but there are much better sandwiches somewhere in town.  Their only saving grace, it their pickles are great, other than that, this place is pretty unforgettable."}
{"text":"I like Port of Subs but this location is awful.   I went for lunch at 11:15 and stood there alone for 10 minutes watching one employee work on a catering order. Yes they only had one employee during lunch and she was in NO hurry. She said \"I'll be right with you\" and then disappeared in the back. By this time I was done. I left and went elsewhere.   I will never go back to this location and would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I paid $14 for the two worst smoothies I have ever had in my life.  All I tasted was powder.  The girls that worked there had issues with English and the concept of \"dairy and egg free\" in one of them.  I am almost positive they put dairy in that one because my throat started itching and swelling after about 1/4 of it.  My wife's tasted like \"old bubblegum\" and it was supposed to be chocolate.  Both were thrown out immediately.  They have the most ridiculously confusing menu I have ever seen and figuring out ingredients is a nightmare.  Stick to Jamba Juice"}
{"text":"Wow what an awesome sandwich spot. Was leaving out of Vegas a little past noon but still wanting breakfast. Port of Subs had the grilled breakfast sub. Large bacon eggs and cheese for only 5.99.   The sandwich prep and ingredients were excellent, I highly recommend the smoked cheddar. Add avocado for 1.50 and you have an incredible sandwich.   Prices are right on, around the same as subway only much better sandwiches."}
{"text":"Workers are great, place is clean, and food is delicious!   And Number 3 grilled two times is the business!!!   I am literally addicted."}
{"text":"Worst. Sub.Ever.  Pre-made grocery subs are better than these, don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Love this port of subs. They always make my sandwich so perfect and they are so nice here!"}
{"text":"Love this one, my favorite. The guy in the middle who makes the sandwiches (dark skin guy), I'm sorry I forgot his name, but he makes the best sandwiches ever. I've never had my sandwich made how I would make my own, so perfectly. Uhhh he's the best! Never experienced such great customer service and perfect sandwich eating at any other sandwich place. Forget about subway, firehouse subs etc, this one port of subs out does everywhere."}
{"text":"Worst port of subs ever! I love there sandwiches but this location dropped the ball.."}
{"text":"This store NEVER has sourdough bread I've wasted my lunch going here 3 times now.. I will never be back to this store, obviously sourdough is popular, make more of it I don't get why that's so hard to process."}
{"text":"I got the turkey avocado bacon sub 12\", shits huge, I like.  It's like a subway but with slighty larger portion of bread/meat."}
{"text":"Bread tastes stale. Customer service not the best. I don't know why I just don't keep going to the Durango one, they are the best port of subs in the valley."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!!! I am vegetarian and went to Port of Subs for a cheese sandwich. I was standing in line and noticed that they were cutting both meat and cheese on the same slicer. When it was my turn, I asked if they had a separate cheese slicer and was told no. Gross! Not only are they cross contaminating food, but they are not vegetarian friendly. Get it together PoS!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am never going back.    I have been coming here for years because of the boar's head meat, but this last experience grossed me out so much I couldn't eat the sandwich.  We returned it.  When I walked in the kid behind the counter was cleaning off the slicer with a wet towel AND his disposable gloves.  He then proceeded to make my sandwich with the same gloves.  This has happened to me a few occasions before, and I've had to tell the guys, \"do you mind swapping your dirty gloves with some new/clean gloves?!\" I can't believe I even have to ask.  They seemed to have corrected that issue over the years, but yet again I'm dealing with it now.  When preparing the sandwich, the  kid manhandled the sandwich through preparation, inadvertently smeared mayo all over the outside of the sandwich with his gloves, shaved meat with fat all the way around the roast beef and packaged the sandwich clumsily and sloppily.  It disgusted me.  I should have said something then and there, but it took some time to process what I had just witnessed.  I blame management.  These kids are clueless and have no idea about quality control.  How this kid can pass inspection and be hired is beyond me.  It's not just this kid.  Most times I walk in, the presentation of the employees beyond the counter is slovenly and messy.  How could management not see that.  In fact, when the sandwich was returned, management was nowhere to be found.  Maybe that explains it."}
{"text":"My experience here was awful! They got my order wrong as well as the pickup time wrong for my daughters graduation party . When I brought this to the managers attention she made it seem like it was my fault . She was rude and when she finally gave us the sandwiches the order was wrong and very little meat on the sandwiches . I will never recommend this place to anyone ."}
{"text":"I would normally rate this place a 5 star just based on the sandwiches alone but I visited today and had to wait 30 min for a sandwich!!! They had one person working during lunch hour.  Clearly understaffed since there was a line of 7 people. Not exactly where I wanted to spend my lunch break."}
{"text":"Freshly sliced cheese and the old man serving us had a heart of gold. The bread didn't look/taste  so fresh and the veggies could be fresher. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Delicious! You can't beat freshly sliced meat and cheese on a sub! :)"}
{"text":"This Port of Subs location is one of the two that I eat at with great frequency. The sandwiches are consistently well made and fresh tasting and they're never out of my favorite chips or beverages. The employees are always friendly, attentive and quick. The dining area is clean with plenty of tables.   The things listed above may sound somewhat generic, but when describing a chain sandwich shop there isn't really a lot more to say. There are however, two things that speak volumes about this Port of Subs. The first is that while most of the rest of the shopping center they are in is dead and gone this store still survives and in fact, is usually pretty busy. The other thing is that the same folks have worked there forever. Generally these types of businesses have a big employee turnover rate. Not here! The bulk of the workers have been there for quite a while. I guess that speaks well of the owners. If they take care of their employees well enough to keep them, my guess is that they take good care of their customers as well."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time recently. Pretty good, and my sandwich was made just the way I like it. Also, they have Coke Zero, which is a BIG hit with me...any place that offers that scores a BIG thumbs-up!   Ordered lunch online and went to pick it up. The place was fairly busy when I got there, which was fine. They had everything ready and loaded up for me. All I had to do was pay and pick out chips and fill the drinks. They even boxed everything so I wouldn't have trouble getting everything into my car. I like that idea a lot!  They are trying to get delivery service up and running so once they do I will have to utilize that. I will definitely spread the word about this place to anyone I know looking for a new sub shop to try."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would but unfortunately when you write a review a rating is required. Anyway my boyfriend went to pick lunch up for us today and when he got there there was only 1 other person in store besides the employee's and himself. He approached the order line and asked for 2 sandwiches to be started... the lady preps the both of them with meats and cheese and then a 2nd employee walks out from the back and starts working on our sandwhich but the 1st employee and 2nd employee don't communicate while working on the line..she then jumps from our sandwiches to the next guys in line sandwhich.... just lots of confusion between those two... then the order was messed up..and the bread on the sandwhich feels so hard... I've been to so many port of sub locations in the valley I've NEVER had bread that felt like this...it's either been left out on the countertop or its simply just not fresh today."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff. They act like your inconveniencing them by coming in and ordering food and giving them your money. MAJOR attitude. Will not be going back to this location. Will instead go to which witch or firehouse."}
{"text":"We ordered the six foot sub party tray containing three different sandwiches, three different breads and the fixings on the side. This was suppose to be our dinner during the super bowl half time. Some started eating when It was noticed there was mold on the bread. We immediately put everything back in the containers. I called Port of Subs but they never picked up(learned the next day that they closed early at 4 pm). We had to put together frozen food for our dinner as we would not eat moldy bread or food that came in contact with the mold. No one would go out to get food because we would miss the second half of the super bowl. I brought the food back the next morning and spoke with the manager, Jaime.  She apologized and told me that the owner does not allow her to give refunds. I was not coming back again so I told her to call the owner. This took quit a while. Finally the owner's wife gave her permission to refund my $54.13. I told her to have the owner call me. Two days later  after not hearing from the owner, I called the corporate office. I was told that  a field consultant would reach out to me. On February 13th the field consultant Gina called and listened to the situation about the mold on the bread. Gina  she would speak with the owner.  First of all, the workers should have noticed the mold on the top of the bread!  Secondly, the owner should care about his business and call if there is a problem!"}
{"text":"The other sandwich place next to work.  This place gets really amazingly busy at lunch time.  You would almost think they were giving away prozac on wheat with phone numbers for bored housewives written in condiments on the bread.  Sadly, this is not the case.  Decent sandwiches though if not nutritious."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I like port of subs, just not this one. Stay away."}
{"text":"Great food, super friendly staff, kind of expensive though. Everything is fresh cut (meats and cheese). Staff was so nice. We talked and laughed the whole time they were making the food. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I've been to many Port of Subs in my short life but wanted to take a moment and recognize the staff at this particular location.  I've gone to this location 4 times now and each time I walk through the door I'm greeted by a staff member who is genuine in her delivery.  Then after I order and the next staff person is adding the toppings and engages in small talk and again, are very genuine. In short, the moment I walk in to the moment I walk out I'm treated with caring service.  I've been in the hospitality industry for almost 18 years and rarely in today's society are you able to come across an entire staff who demonstrate what it is to provide superior customer service.  To the staff and management at this Port of Subs I want to say keep up the great work and most importantly, THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs, and this location has very consistent quality & service.   We get a 2 ft sandwich for $12.99 and have food for 2 days.  We get the ham & turkey on white with their mustard/mayo combo, lettuce, olives, red onions, pepperoncinis and have it sprinkled with oil/vinegar, salt/pepper & oregano...yum."}
{"text":"We finally came back and tried again..definitely much better than our first handful experiences.  Port of Subs make the best sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid subs I went with a basic turkey n provolone sub. I would say the subs are priced accurately.  The parking lot is a little tight during lunch hours. Personally I woukd stick with johna deli for hot sandwhiches."}
{"text":"I ordered at 11:00 and didn't get my sandwich and macaroni salad until 12:50 the lady i called was really nice and called the driver within the 2 minutes of calling her the driver showed up so i don't think i was the restaurants  fault but the driver's . The store was only 1.1 mile away from my house so i really don't think traffic was a reasonable excuse. It was a Tuesday afternoon"}
{"text":"I have to say I am really in love with this location. Its not far from home, never too busy,  and pretty consistent when  it comes to flavor and quality.  The number 13 with pastrami turkey and Swiss on wheat is still my favorite trumping the other 17 selections not including breakfast items.  Next time,  don't hesitate, don't wait,  you don't even have to get dressed really (secrets of a drive thru queen) just get to port of subs for a great sandwich!"}
{"text":"This is hands up the number one port of subs in Nevada. Yes. I'm sure! They consistently have the freshest ingredients and I'm never anything short of excited to eat after ordering. Sadly I can't remember his name, but the guy that works the front is so attentive and really knowledgeable when it comes to the menu. He also always reminds me to use my port of subs rewards card which is apart of a new program they have that gives port of subs' loyal customers an opportunity to get possibly free food! I'd say if you like your sandwich guy friendly, your tomatoes ripe, your bread soft, and meats cut fresh get to this location! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"As far as sandwiches go, Port of Subs is my go-to. Full disclosure- I worked for the Port (different location) like 7 years ago, so I developed a healthy addiction for their food. From an insiders perspective, I can say the employees and management really work hard to maintain high quality food. Years later, as a consumer, I still find this to be true. Some things (like the avocado) have even improved! My favorite things to get are the hot pastrami griller and the salami peperoni sandwich (which I also request to have grilled). You must get the smokey cheddar cheese. On everything. Seriously. Also, try the mayo-mustard combo. It sounds silly, and I am honestly not the biggest fan of mayo, but the mayo-mustard ratio is on point and it adds so much to the sandwich.   Back in the day, Port of Subs only delivered for large catering orders. Now there is only an $8 minimum for delivery (at least for this location) making it one of the most affordable delivery options available. Sandwiches are also like SUPER affordable, like my medium sandwich with avocado added didn't meet the minimum so I ended up getting a drink too. Even after tax and tip my total was about $12. You seriously can't get that anywhere else, especially for the quality. This is not your sad subway sandwich.   Customer service is also always great, the employees are awesome. Sometimes they do get busy, so naturally things take a little longer, but they are always apologetic and its apparent they are working their butts off to get the job done. Ultimately, it's always worth the wait and I'll keep ordering from this location every time I have a craving for some hot pastrami and smokey cheddar."}
{"text":"Man, they've got some really dry nasty bread.  I wanted to like this place, and the meat is actually pretty good.  I was eating my sub on wheat noting how dry the bread was when I tried a bit of my wife's sourdough.  I only thought mine was dry, the sourdough was terrible.  Oh well."}
{"text":"It's 7pm and they literally had three loaves of bread left. And telling customers they arent able to make anymore. Poor planning, come in you had a line of people willing to order that walked out because you could plan of having a couple more loaves of bread. This is not the first time this has happened either."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Port-O-Sub ever. This kid gives me the worst attitude when I am ordering my sandwich. Maybe because it was 5 minutes to closing. He didn't even had me my sandwich,he just gave my card and walked away. Great so I went ahead and ate there just to agitate him. He threatened to call his owner I told him please do because I would really love to talk to her about her away. He also turned up the music really loud hoping I would leave. Well buddy I use to run a night club. I finished my food continues to enjoy my night!"}
{"text":"Awful experience waiting 20 minutes in line. Clearly not enough staff or foresight to expect large Halloween orders. Good food but not sure if I can come back if this wait will be the norm."}
{"text":"Port of Subs franchise seems to have gone a little downhill on their sandwiches. Not sure if they are buying different meats or just starting to slim down on the amount they put on. The problem is just like bars and pizza joints in this town. They are around every corner. So unless you have a superb sandwich on the cheap then you are not going to win over the masses."}
{"text":"Food is ok at best. But the service is absolutely horrible. Teens serving you food with an attitude that makes you feel like your a inconvenience.   The bread was good but the veggies looks days old."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, Fresh ingredients, and DAMON! He is the best. I drive by other port of subs just to eat at his place. He and the sandwiches are awesome. Much fresher and better than any other chain sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Seriously the friendliest staff! I want to say he's the owner but on several occasions he's been working when I go and he goes out of his way to make sure you have a good experience! And of course the delicious sandwiches are always on point."}
{"text":"Your better off going to the location down the street. They are constantly out of everything! How can you be out of white bread at 5pm on a Thursday. The following time we came here, they were out of smoked cheddar."}
{"text":"Great ingredients and a nice change from the normal subway.  It's a bit expensive for a sub shop. Clean appearance, nice staff."}
{"text":"The people that work here are always very nice and helpful even when they have long lines and online orders. They are able to work together and knock out all the orders quickly and effectively! Props to Gloria and Crystal!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's just a Port Of Sub. But, it's a damn good one.   Yes, I've been eating sandwiches and loving it. This year has been more about increasing my credit score and Savings account and less about obsessing over carbs. This place is my go to for a quick sammie since it's thirty seconds from home.  They always have a guy cleaning.  They always wash their hands before they put on gloves to make my sandwich.   The meat here just tastes better than that other store that rhymes with Great Lay.  The staff is ALWAYS friendly and fast so guess what? I always tip them. I appreciate that shit.  I love calling in my order ahead of time so I can keep the car running with my sexy sausage dog in tow and just run in and grab my sandwich. I can do all of this before the commercial break is over. Wait, do people even watch tv like that anymore? Not me.  No, they aren't finding a cure for Cancer here, but they give it to me fast, fresh and at a price I can live with. They deserve a shout out for it."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of visiting the Port O Subs location on Sandhill and Sunset. It's closer to my home and I was trying to save time. BIG MISTAKE. I don't know if the company imposes quality control on it's franchisees, but the Sandhill location gave me razor thin slices of everything. I always order the Italian #1 and the location on Sandhill gave me slices so thin, that the meat had holes in it at it's thinnest points.   This location restored my faith in the brand and convinced me that the Sandhill location should lose it's franchise. I nearly stopped coming to any Port of Subs as I also recently discovered Capriotti's.  Port o' Subs uses real albacore tuna and spreads it on thick, far better than Subway tuna. The potato salad is beautiful and they serve real Coca Cola, not the imitation stuff. A rare 5-star entry for this store as it serves the Port o' Subs brand well! A terrific ambassador!"}
{"text":"They offer sub of the day which is good for lunch. Friendly staff and bright atmosphere!"}
{"text":"So according to a review Subway is better...that almost stopped me from going to this place for lunch. I ordered the #1 which was the Italian sub, I got it on white bread and was far from being disappointed.   First off they cut/shave the meat right there in front of you (this was awesome except seeing the young lady who was cutting continually wiping the sweat off of her forehand) they don't have an array of topics, but what they have is all that you need.  When I bit in to my sandwich,  I noticed everything was super fresh. The bread had the perfect texture, and the bonus, it had a nice salty taste. Mixed with the the vinegar and oil that I never get at Subway (because of the soggy bread effect) this was just the finishing touch.   Port of Subs blows Subway and Jimmy Johns with their \"lightening speed\" straight out of the water. (Lame closing in 3....2...1...)  I definitely will port here again haha"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm one of my favorite sandwich locations. Services is very friendly. They are always busy at lunch time which is a great sign."}
{"text":"I have been going to Port of Subs in Las Vegas every now and then for at least 23 years. Never a complaint about the food or service, felt a very positive vibe from Port of Subs and treated with respect. This changed when I was in Port  of Subs yesterday after noon and waited on a woman who later said she was the manager named, Desiree. I walked in a good mood and there was one man getting his sandwiches made. I was not impatient, or any trouble, just watching the sandwich making and waiting. When it was my turn she looked at me strait face with out a greeting and stated with a tone of annoyance; \"What can I get for you, Ma'am?\" Since I was there to get the largest one for my child and I said, \"What does the 13 inch look like.\" She said in the same tone that carried on; \"We don't have a 13 inch.\" She said nothing further and as I scanned the board, I said; \"Oh, I was looking at the 13 dollars that was by the 2 foot, I guess the 12 inch one is the next smaller one?\" She said with out pointing or gesturing; \"its right there in front.\" I said I would take that one and said wheat bread, as she picked up to cut it, I said, \"oh..no pickles.\" and then she said \"Tell me later, when I get to it.\" During this time another customer walked in that was a regular as the way she spoke to her, as Desiree started to cut the meat and cheese, she was chatting and smiling and making eye contact with full attention on the regular customer. She even apologized to the regular customer that was in the process of making \"hers\"(mine)! As if I was in the way, and that is exactly what she projected. I noticed the turkey and cheese was almost shaved, and when she proceeded to put the toppings on I told her \"no jalapenos\" and then she reached for them so I said it again and she took her hand back out and didn't move and rolled her eyes as if to say, \"well then what DO you want.\" The rest of the toppings, the lettuce etc. was scanty. The sandwich looked flat. She continued with this disrespect until I paid. I waited on the side because I don't like to make a scene and I wanted to ask her who her manager was. So as I watched her make this next customers food, the regular, she asked for double everything. The sandwich was huge, she was putting on handfulls of meat cheese etc... If mine was doubled it would not have even been half that size! Then another man can  and ordered and his sandwiches, were made much fuller than mine as well and so was the customer before me. I finally left and called the store and I she said she was the manager and I told her that I would have talked to her in person but since I would not say it in front of others, I called and then I told her that she was very rude and there was nothing I did to merit that. She did not act surprised or say something like..\"I did not realize it or I would never do that on purpose ...\" She said in a very monotone voice; \"I'm sorry I won't do it again.\" Then I asked why she did it and she repeated the statement. This was telling that she knew she was and the called ended. I was buying the sandwich for my child who I was meeting with and only had an hour to talk to her, my child is not eating and not well and I wanted  to get Port of Subs for the protein and other good veg. There was nothing on that sandwich almost just bread. I could not use the time well to speak to my child because I was shaken by the very bad experience which felt borderline abusive, she was bullying me.  I could not get my thoughts together or on the topic. I continued to have anxiety later that night because I would not be seeing my child again and if anyone needed the food, they did. I feel she cheated my child and she really did. I never experienced this negative energy and treatment ever at any Port of Subs. This is how Desiree presented the one time welcoming environment of Port of Subs to one that was telling me I was not welcomed. Desiree  might be a manager but manage to do this. If I received a sandwich made like that 20 years ago or anytime, I would have never went back to Port of Subs. I would have remembered not to go back, and that you don't get what you pay for. Desiree was playing favorites with the customer and using the product as she wished or did not wish,  giving her whopping amounts of food, even to excess; handfuls of meat, cheese, and mine, she did not even put the minimum required and shaved it. Unlike Desiree, this is not my former experience with anyone else at any Port of Subs. All workers have consistently dealt with me in a professional manner, which is to put attention to you and to make sure you're feeling good about the establishment and the food they're serving. I always walked out of Port of Subs feeling happy that I walked in."}
{"text":"My family and I came in on Mother's Day after running some errands. There was 3 young men (around high school age) that were working. We asked if we could buy just a kids meal sandwich without the meal. The guy helping us said yes. Then we proceed to pay for it and a different guy rang us up. He explained that we had to buy the whole meal and they don't sell just the sandwich. So that was irritating. We didn't want to pay for the whole kids meal. They also didn't explain to us that adding avocado would be an extra $3 per sandwich. It didn't seem like they knew what they were doing. The thing that made me MOST upset was before we got there they were vacuuming the carpets. All of the tables and chairs were pulled over to the right side. I am 5 months pregnant and had 3 other small kids with me ages 6,4 and 2. After receiving our food we proceeded to try and find a table but had to rearrange the tables and chairs ourselves while the guys watched us. Trying to get the the high chairs I had to move 3 tables that were in the way. They never once came over to offer to help or move the tables and chairs back so we could sit and eat. There was only one other customer in line and 3 guys working behind the counter. You would think one of them would come over and help me. The whole experience was rather irritating. They didn't seem to know what to do or how to serve customers. The sandwiches were great but the communication and service was terrible. For that reason, I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Sooooo many choices around. Port of Subs has been around before all of the other sub places in the area and the reason is the food and bread is always fresh. We have always had great service here. They offer a special 2 foot cold sub for $12.99!! What a deal."}
{"text":"To start with, the owner Lynne is amazing!! She truly cares about her staff, the quality of the product being served as well as the customers they help. The 2 AWESOME GIRLS (jackie and her friend sorry he'll I forgot her name!!) who always make my sandwich perfect are simply put The BEST!!! Always timely and extremely personable!!! Thank you for always being so delightful!! Visit this location, and jacki won't let you down!!!"}
{"text":"I am a known Subway fanatic, through and through.  However, change is sometimes welcomed. The bread here is fresh and fantastic.  The staff here is quick, professional, and friendly.  The meats seem to be more plentiful since they slice it right there.  Fresh ingredients.  Love it!  It seems to be a little more expensive than Subway.  Also it does seem to have more calories than a comparable sandwich from Subway.  That being said, they are especially delicious.  Like REALLY good! :-)"}
{"text":"I was greeted upon entering, and the staff was attentive and spoke clearly. While one of the staff looked liken she was fairly new, her manager helped her out and was patient.  Good sandwich as always!"}
{"text":"Called in my order for pick up the gentleman was very nice and thorough with my order. Upon arrival my order was ready great service"}
{"text":"Went here last night to grab a couple sandwiches for dinner.  The guy that made my boyfriend's sandwich was awesome. He was outgoing and provided great customer service.  I'd give him 5 stars.  The reason for the 3 is because the girl that made my sandwich was really quiet, which is fine it's just really hard to hear over the glass.  I ordered a pilgrim griller.  I was excited because I wait and eat them once a year.  But with every single topping she worked so hard to stretch it out across the bread.  There was so little stuffing and the cranberry sauce only covered about 3/4 of my sandwich.  I guess I could've asked for more, but it took about 10 mins just to get the stuffing warmed the first time.  Then the spinach was piled high so that was most of my sandwich   Overall it was fine, but Port of Subs isn't cheap so I should at least get a decent amount of what I'm paying for."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0, I would. We have ate at several other port of sub locations and this one is by far the worst. Their lettuce portions for the salads is very slim as well as their meat. I have to order double meat only at this location and it is still not enough. My husband had a sandwich there and the white bread was hard as a rock. We have tried on several occasions and their quality is nothing compared to other locations. This store is much more convenient to my house, but I am more than willing to drive the extra mile or 2 to go to the sunset rainbow location or Durango flamingo location!!"}
{"text":"The sign on the door reads ANY 2 foot long sandwiches for $10.95.Also the Middle Eastern lady behind the counter told me about this special before I ordered.When I went to pay she charged me for the normal price (about$20) .When I asked why she said it was because the 2 foot long sandwiches I ordered were not the same .She never told me I had to buy 2 footlongs that were exactly the same to get the discount !! Nowhere on the sign does it state that ethier .The sign is VERY misleading. At least they could have informed me when they were making the sandwiches.What a joke.I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Asked to have cheese on my sandwich.  Watched as he put the thinest pieces ever.  Didn't know you could slice so thin.  Wanted some onion, and to my amazement he one by one put maybe 10 little strands on a double bread.  Unbelieable cheapnice.  Eventually these people will run out of repeat customers and end it all."}
{"text":"Place is always dirty and employees just stand around when nobody is there. Clearly they think they only need to clean at closing. Don't waste your time here. Drive just down the street and visit the one on badura. They have their stuff together."}
{"text":"Oh man! This place is delicious!! The Mayo-Mustard spread is so addicting! The meat is freshly sliced, and the bread is super soft! One of my favorite sub sandwhich places."}
{"text":"We were in today and the service was awesome!  The food too, but the Manager was really a rock star and went out of his way:)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I thought I would give this place one final chance they offer a sale of 2 footlongs for $11.99 the catch is it has to be the 2ft bread. Which is not fresh left over made yesterday. They will not substitute it with fresh bread. Very fishy. So do not spent any money here. I sure wont."}
{"text":"Had a great #8.  Staff was friendly! Environment was clean and quiet on the outdoor patio seating."}
{"text":"I really wasn't impressed with the service or the food."}
{"text":"2nd time I've gone there this week and the store is not open its 4:17 in the after noon on a friday.. WTF"}
{"text":"I came to eat today with my son and our subs were so good!!!! My son is sooooo  picky with his food. But Roxanne made us some real good tasting subs and he was happy!!! Happy son? Happy mom!"}
{"text":"This port of subs is often busy but the ladies that work here are fast and efficient. Always a fan of port of subs. I wish they were open sundays."}
{"text":"Love this Port of Subs . They offer delivery with EAT24 and GrubHub ... The food was delivered extremely fast on 12 miles from the restaurant ! Definitely will   Order again !! Thanks Port of Subs"}
{"text":"Thank you so much Port of Subs. Your management and employees are amazing. After being robbed of my money from another Restaurant these amazing people accommodated my husband whom hadn't eaten in a day and a half. Very long story. Port of Subs #39 you rock. Thank you so very much. My husband said the Sub was perfect. I would recommend anyone that is close to this Port of Subs #39 at the Airport to eat there. Even if you have to go out of your way a little. If you have a long flight look for this amazing Port of Subs. Warm friendly and excellent customer service. Sincerely  Shelly C"}
{"text":"Extremely upset with this Port Of Subs. The manager intentionally lied to me when I called about getting my husband a Sub. He lead me to believe they where at the Las Vegas airport where my husband is. I went to the portofsubs.com and paid for my order on line only to find out I had  been lied to and mislead. My husband went to get his sub and was told they didn't have an order. I talked to the manager of the Port of Sub at the Airport #39 they told me they do not except on line orders. I called this manager back and he even told me he was the owner. He full well knew that the airport Port Of subs do not except on line orders. Then proceeds to lie to me more. Port of subs #15 you really need to quit lying and robbing people of there money. Your manager needs to be fired for saying he was the owner! You should have given me my money back. Now I will take this even further. I will find out who the owner is get my money. $14.00. ! #15 port of subs you need a new manager. Hope you enjoy my money you are a thief sir."}
{"text":"Change your settings on Yelp. It says you open at 8AM Sundays. They don't operate until 9AM."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs, I order the same sandwich every time I go there and I never get sick of it. The ham, cheese and veggies that they put in the sandwich that I order every time taste very fresh. In my opinion, Port of  Subs is way better than Subway a hundred percent."}
{"text":"In its category is good food, reasonable price. Wraps, flatbreads and subs. For breakfast with egg, american cheese with bacon, ham or turkey sausage and for lunch meatballs, pastrami, turkey and get it on a combo with chips and tea, water or soda for a few extra bucks. Didnt get the cookie, dunno if its worth it or not, have you tried it?"}
{"text":"The worst POS's in Tempe or maybe even East Valley!  Rude employees with bad attitudes!  Poor quality food and sloppily made sandwiches. Avoid at all costs!!"}
{"text":"Staff so nice!  Just had lunch with family here. My 3 yr old loves to get kids meal here (turkey cheese sandwich, cheetos, Oreo, drink) . Very little seating but it's connected to a gas station which is interesting because you have to go into gas station to fill your fountain drink or to use restroom. Good quick place and much better than fast food!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place a million times and never stopped, so today I did. I basically was in an overpriced Subaway called Port of subs. The sub was ok, nothing special. They do not have a good variety of bread choices and none of their subs really sounded that good. I was SUPer starving, if I wasn't I probally would have left and ate somewhere else.  The staff was very nice and the place was clean. I do think I will eat there again."}
{"text":"As much as I enjoy a sandwich from Port of Subs, I never really expected to write a review. I think most people know what they are getting from this sandwich shop. I haven't been in a long time and figured I check to see if they were as good as I remembered. First I s pleasantly surprised to see that they have sourdough bread. Have they always had this? I don't know, but I'm happy. I always liked their bread, but sourdough is my favorite.   I ordered my standard turkey and smokey cheddar. The process seems the same and the sandwich was good. The standout and main reason for this review was Nathan. He was Courteous and friendly while being efficient. I was very impressed with his work ethic."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Let me repeat, WOW!!!! I didn't get the names of the two employees who were on shift that night, but WOW!!!!! I walked in about 7:50 and KNEW they were closing at 8:00... The female employee already had the meat machine broken down and was cleaning it.  I asked if they were still open.  Wow!!! No groans, no evil eye, no nothing!!! She said yes, and was very patient as I rudely used my cell phone to get my wife's order.  The male helped by putting the machine back together and slicing the meats.  Wow!!! Just Wow!!! The manager should check whom was working that night and give them a serious commendation!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge sub fan to start with....  The subs are good, the selection is good, the price is a bit high for my liking.   They now have breakfast....might have to try that."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs! I have never been disappointed whenever I have went for a sandwich.  Very consistent and fresh! Staff is very friendly and personable"}
{"text":"Food is excellent here and service is good so they deserve at least 4 stars. I only have 1 very minor complaint about my visit today. Normally they have kind of a script where they ask you what you want the same way, it's something along the lines of \"would you like mayo or mustard? Lettuce, onion, tomato? Salt  pepper, oregano?\" This time the lady just said, \"what do you want on it?\" Since I didn't have a list of options to pick from and they were feeling kinda rushed from a long line, I totally forgot to ask for onions. So I wish she would've asked the normal way instead of just asking what I want.  Like I said, just a very minor complaint, but I hope the manager reads this and tells them to ask the normal way."}
{"text":"I went in & the vibe was just all cheerful !  The customer service was amazing !! :D  I ordered 3 party platers as an emergency & they were ready in 20 minutes !!!  & the grilled cheese sandwiches that they make are the best !! Most definitely going back for some more :)))"}
{"text":"This place is solid.  The staff is very generous with the toppings on the sandwiches (you can see the medium sub that I had and it's overflowing), and they are very pleasant when making your order.  I'm a big fan of the smokey cheddar that is served at Port of Subs and I substitute on every sandwich I've ever had, and this place was accommodating of that request too, so I definitely appreciated that.  The parking in this shopping center is a bit tight as there are other food vendors right nearby, so you have a lot of foot and car traffic flowing.    I will be back for a tasty sub with some smokey cheddar, for sure."}
{"text":"As much as I love Port of Subs, this location is the worst. We have had issues before but today when my boyfriend went in to pick up our order that we placed online, they once again had apparently received no order. Weird considering we had a confirmation email. Instead of fixing the problem or trying to look in the system for the order, they wanted us to wait after 10 more people had filed in and then they would get to us. Terrible customer service. Won't be going back to that location again, lesson learned."}
{"text":"While I really like the hand-sliced sandwiches, this location's customer service leaves something to be desired. There were two teenagers behind the counter, and neither one of them were polite. For example, I kindly requested avocado on my sandwich, and one employee simply walked away disgruntled because their avocado bin was empty. The gentleman returned very upset and flung the items on to my sandwich, which caused some of the dressings to hit the protective sneeze-guard.    In addition, this location tends to make sandwiches for everyone in line at the same time. This isn't efficient for the customers that have come in first.   I won't be returning to this location; there's another Port of Subs a few blocks away where they are friendlier!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Love how they shave the meat in front of you. The clerks are very prompt and polite. Yummy sandwiches."}
{"text":"First, a confession. I like Port of Subs quite a bit.  It's probably my favorite sub place.  That being said, this was not the best Port of Subs experience I've had.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, as usual, and the folks were nice enough, but they were so damn slow.  Like to a crawl.  There were a few folks in line, but the staff just seemed completely overwhelmed.  It took forever for them to work through the 3 people in front of me and put my order together.  I'll be back, because it's close to my home and the food was good, but please people, work faster!"}
{"text":"Not impressed..I ordered the #11 ham and cheese which is usually my go to at any sandwich place. It was just plain nothing special. I think jimmy johns, jersey mikes, and az sandwich company are all better! I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"My gf loves port of subs so I decided to surprise her with a salad for lunch today.  She always gets the #1, and at Port you can turn any sandwich into a salad for about 6 bucks.  I was going to get a salad for each of us, but after seeing the size of that thing I decided I would make her share with me :o).  The salad was good.  Provolone, pepperoni, salami and something else??,  of course I also got lettuce and tomato, pickles, black olives, and peperoncinis.    M loved the surprise, I'm sure she would have rather had a sandwich but I know the guilt would kill her.  I've been here before a few times...  had the cesar wrap last time.  It was tasty, but OMG - it was the size of Texas!  After looking at the nutritional facts I won't be ordering ANY of their wraps!  Thank God I couldn't finish that thing!  Anyway, its a good lunch place.  They still can't eff with my Cheeba Hut though!"}
{"text":"Worst Port of Subs ever! Slow service. Out of things at a reasonable hour! And the cashier just dropped my change on the counter. I thought it might be a mistake, but then she did the same thing with my receipt and my loyalty card. And I don't mean just placed the items on the counter, dropped them without a care in the world."}
{"text":"My sandwich was incredibly fresh, especially the bread. Delicious, and made perfectly. The employees were very efficient and nice. Place was clean. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs but this one was below the standards I expect. Employees were complaining to each other about work while my sandwich was being made. The restaurant lacked cleanliness. Crumbs at every table. Would be 2 stars, but the food was still very good, so I give it 3 stars. Would not want to come to this location again."}
{"text":"This Port of Subs was the worst ever. The guy name Chris (Zelda hat) was extremely rude. He was giving dirty looks to me for no reason. When I question him because it kept going on for a while he said what you can't read the sign. I said the yes the sign said reframe talking on your phone when ordering. I was on a phone listening to music for two hours waiting to talk to the insurance company so they approve my daughter procedure. I said I'm not talking on the phone at all. I ordered my food he then was still giving me dirty looks and talking s*** to the manger and they were laughing. So my daughter said mom we don't need to spend our money here we will go to another port of sub. I then asked if I can speak to the manger he pointed to the lady said she the manger ( the one he was laughing with)  I said excuse me are you the manger she said yea I said so why would you sit there and let your employee talk to your customer like this. She didn't say anything, so I asked her what's her boss # she said we are a franchise and not corporate, I said ok that's fine you don't own the business what's his information. While Chris is in the back talking s*** I'm not paying him any mind. He said something to my daughter she 16 then my daughter said I'm going to need you to stop disrespecting my mom. He said no and continued to talk s***. While the manger just sat there doing nothing. So my daughter said something back to him and she said back to her and I told him he was a very ignorant person. Then I asked again for info to whom I can speak to. And the manger said Chris give her the # he said NO! Then he said I don't know Were it is she then told him. He talked s*** while writing it down. Then tossed it on the counter were other customer was standing. My daughter said you need to give that to her he said no I don't. While he was talking s**** to my 16 year old daughter I asked the manger can she please hand it to me. (A few times) she finally said you have to wait till I'm finished. Then Chris said he was calling security I told him that would be fine as I waited for the security she pulled up me still on hold on the phone. I told her the whole story and she said that she didn't understand why he would treat abut like that. We left I called Corp port of subs and waiting on a return call. There's two clearly should not be in customer service what's so ever."}

{"text":"I'm happy to see that Port Of Subs pays attention to online reviews. My previous issues have been addressed and changes have been made accordingly. I've had several recent visits that have been awesome. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Always satisfied when I go to Port of Subs. Their sandwiches are very flavorful. I usually get the #8, Turkey & Provolone. It costs about $7 or $8. My girlfriend and I usually share a drink instead of getting two drinks.  The staff is always nice, the music is good too. They were playing 90's Alternative (talk about 90's throwback eh?). I'll continue to come here as long as they continue to offer awesome sandwiches and great customer service."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Jersey Mikes and thought I found the ultimate sub. Well now I've found Port of Subs. The \"number 1\" is essentially JM's Italian. And it's awesome! Port of Subs gets the edge for price too with a foot long coming in easily a few or five bucks less thank Mikes.   There's also a 24\" sub for the best value on what amounts to 2 footlongs. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Another great Port of Subs experience! The XL #1 on white with double meat! That's a beast of a sandwich and great value!!! FYI, a 2 foot sandwich is just a really good deal on two 1 foot sammys. But you can top them differently so sharing is possible, easy, and probably recommended! :)  Oh, don't forget to pick up a Port of Subs loyalty card and register it. Every $100 gets you a free footlong sub of your choice and registering it online earns you a free small sub during your birthday month."}
{"text":"I have never walked out of a port of subs before this. I love pos. My auto correct knows port of subs!! You almost can't mess it up because the ingredients are amazing and fresh and they are a great company, but this one, in summerlin is atrocious. The manager there i have never had a good experience with. I work across the street so I have used this pos many times, and each time, she is too fast and doesn't listen and is rude and rushing. She sneezed on food today, and said nothing, she messed up my sandwich and tried to fix it and failed instead of remaking it. I was so grossed out that I walked out before it was even finished or  wrapped up. I have had it. Things like this have happened every time I have gone there. Love love love pos. Fire that manager tho.."}
{"text":"They aren't very clean. I was disappointed to say. The food was okay it got drenched in vinegar.. I would stick to the summerline port of subs"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and up beat and the food is always on point! Convenient, cozy place to eat lunch, and will return on a regular basis. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Love the food but one of the employees had terrible    hygiene.  It seemed like she had not washed her hair in weeks ! Flakes from her hair all over her shirt/ hat there is a good chance it could get on the food ! We had to walk out since we were disgusted!"}
{"text":"My 5 star rating isn't for Port of Subs itself.  It's for Nolan. I visited this location on 10/13/16 and it was fairly busy and it was basically just Nolan working. There was another young guy,  who just seemed to be a fish out of water. Maybe he was new? I don't know but young guy on top of being particularly slow at making the sandwiches forgot my husband's bacon, and Nolan was super attentive and great at multitasking.  He called for I'm guessing a manager's help and she was quite rude. But Nolan handled the busy rush with ease and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves.  Thank you Nolan!"}
{"text":"I walked in and the first words out of Mariah's mouth was \"we don't have white bread.\" Why did she assume that I wanted white bread?  I replied that it was ok that I didn't care. I had to repeat my order multiple times but the biggest surprise was to come later. Surprise!  I repeated my phone number 3 times because Mariah couldn't focus to input my phone number correctly. She told me that it wouldn't be a problem to give her my phone number. After striking out the 3rd time I gave her my card.   The guy actually making my sandwich tried his best. He did a pretty good job but Mariah had already set a negative tone with a \"get out of Dodge attitude.\"  I did take a year + break from this location because of Mariah's attitude and lack of focus. I decided to visit since my husband requests burritos from time to time from Roberto's. I'm vegan and decided to give Port Of Subs another chance.   TIP- I am visiting Subway across the street or Firehouse Subs. The people are way nicer and pay attention to detail. Also if you are vegetarian you have to REQUEST to have the slicer cleaned if you are having cheese sliced. They slice meat on that same slicer and will not voluntarily clean unless you ask. I had the manager get very ugly because I wanted the slicer cleaned when I was a vegetarian. There was a line at lunch and the attitude was that I was wasting her time. What is the point of being vegetarian when the slicer is sullied with sliced meat?"}
{"text":"My coworker and I got to this place all the time for lunch. They make our food super fast and our food is always delicious"}
{"text":"This is another one of those reviews where I wish I could leave half stars. Since I can't, I'm giving it a lower grade because I just don't think it's worth 4 stars. For lunch, this place definitely hits the spot and tastes good. I have 2 criticisms though. One, I do not understand paying the exact same for a sandwich because their options vary in meat selection and non-meat selections. A turkey and provolone should not cost the same as a meat stuffed with 4-5 different meats. Just sayin. And two, which is my biggest criticism, is they are ONLY OPEN UNTIL 5PM?!?!?! What kind of crap is that?!?! How much business is this place losing by closing so early? I came here for dinner once and was shooed away at the door at 4:59PM. Wow.  All in all, this place is good and would recommend. Their meat and cheeses are sliced fresh every order and I do like the fact there are 2 separate counters for ordering. Prices are also reasonable, way better than Jersey Mike's. Location here isn't awesome, it's a little hidden off Broadway and 48th street. It's next to Papa John's so when you see that, turn into the complex with Staples.  It's minutes from work so I am somewhat of a regular here. Will keep coming back because it's yummy!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch...service line is in the back so you have to walk around the dining area or cut people off in line to \"start\". I had to re-direct a couple people who came in after me. Service was also really slow and the meat slicer was spitting out meat across the counter. Then, while one of the staff was making my sandwich, there was a disgusting guy who literally came in, cut me off in line, proceeded to the cash register and demanded change for the bus (mind you he didn't order food but would \"think about it\"). Staff didn't say anything since he wasn't ordering a sandwich...rude much?! I get to the cash register and she asked if I wanted to leave a tip...for what?! Crappy service, rude patrons and mediocre food? No thanks! Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Every single time I come to get a sub, I'm delighted with customer service AND the food is always fresh and delicious. I love that I can ask \"make what you think I'd love...\" and they put together a unique amd custom sub that always makes me smile! The staff is fantastic, the food is awesome and the place is always clean. I love it!"}
{"text":"Great food guys; however this occasion the time management was not was it usually is when myself or I'm there with a previous customer . This time there was a customer in front of me who left after me and the person who walked in after me was serviced before me and was still last to leave. This was 2pm on Monday with at least 4 workers in the front and maybe more in the back . Not sure what happened before I arrived so I wanted to leave this review since that was something I expect from other places I don't go to anymore ."}
{"text":"Amy is wonderful and can remember 5 orders at once.  She was able to service six of us individually and remember all the details!!! She made my day."}
{"text":"Matt and Vince are very attentive and genuine! This is my new Go To sandwich shop! Great atmosphere with a sense of community."}
{"text":"Accidentally wrote my review for a Port of Subs at the wrong terminal at McCarran - the one at the D gates is grossly over priced.  Will chose differently the next time I'm passing through Vegas."}
{"text":"My preferred sandwich shop and location. The sandwiches are consistently good with friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"I used to eat Port of Subs a lot when I was younger, but I am not as huge of a fan as an adult. We have more options around town now and Port of Subs has skimped on the fillings over the years while the prices have gone up. This is one of the 2 Port of Subs locations (other is all the way across town) that I'll actually eat at because they are pretty consistent, the staff is friendly, inside is clean and the bread always tastes so fresh and yummy. They have one of those freestyle soda machines, so keep that in mind if you don't like them like me. I usually get my order to-go and just enjoy my own Coke from a can at home. The meats and cheeses are sliced to order and they have a good variety of veggies and dressings to add to your sub. You can make any sub a \"stacker\" which means double meat and cheese.  Sub Sizes:  Small - 5 inches medium - 8 inches large - 12 inches extra large - 24 inches   Classic Sub #1 ($14.99 for 2 foot sub) - Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni and Provolone Cheese are on this sub and you can choose your bread. I like their white bread, it holds the fillings in well and tastes good. The price for 24 inches is fair, but keep in mind that it's not the same at each location and sometimes they make two 12 inchers, which hubby and I don't mind because it allows us to pick our own toppings and bread.  Any sub can be made as a wrap or salad. They take phone orders, online orders and offer catering."}
{"text":"I called in a phone order for the 2 foot ($11.99 plus tax) cold sub special and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes or less. When I arrived there were no customers inside and no employees in sight. Finally a guy came from the back and said he'd be right with me. Inside was clean, but the veggies and other selections to choose from weren't looking so fresh. Had I walked in and placed the order in person instead of over the phone, I wouldn't have ordered honestly after seeing that. I let the guy know I placed a phone order and gave him my name. He rung me up and gave me the order. They don't have the stamp card here anymore and wouldn't accept the one I had, so keep that in mind of you have a one. The guy was though nice and friendly.  Classic Sub #1 - I chose white bread and this sandwich comes with ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni and provolone cheese. Sounds great right? Well my sandwich looked skimpy for the description of the sandwich. I remember POS tasting much better and getting a bigger portion back in the day. The bread seemed like it might have been from the day before and wasn't so fresh. The lettuce had a nasty \"bag mix\" taste and the meat and cheese tasted just so-so. I've definitely had better from other sandwich spots."}
{"text":"I have eaten here now about 5 times and am delighted every time. If you check the money mailer that comes in the mail they often have coupons. This last visit I got a \"Turkey Avocado Sub\". I was able to use a coupon for a x-large sub for just $10.99 with the purchase of a drink so hubby and I had a reasonable and delicious lunch.   I like that they slice the meat fresh in front of you unlike Subway who has theirs sitting in a container. The staff has been nice and the place is neat and clean inside. A majority of the time I am working from my home office so I rely on nearby places like this to grab a quick lunch. I will be stopping in here often."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's the owners of the convenient stores putting the Port of Subs locations in or if this is just the new trend of how one gets built, but I have noticed more than one ampm with a Port of Subs location. It's not inside ampm, but is right next door with its own door. I like having a familiar place to get food and I actually like that it's separate from the gas station instead of the typical nasty pizza, sandwich and heat lamp food options you find inside places like that.  Walking inside Port of Subs I noticed that it's small, but still offered some tables and chairs and it looked clean. There wasn't any other customers unless you count the people sitting at a table with 2 of the employees who were all eating. One of them got up to help me and she was really nice however still preoccupied at times by the chatter and laughter of the other co-worker and friends. I have also been back by 2 other times since my first visit and the hours posted say they close at 7 pm, but I showed up one day at 6:15 pm and then 6:40 pm on another day and they were closed already. The same 2 girls who helped me the first time had all the chairs outside and were cleaning up inside. Isn't this something they are supposed to do after 7 pm when they close? It seems to me they are closing up early to leave early or maybe right at that 7 mark and that's not cool.    Classic Sub #1 ($7.99 large) - Ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni and provolone Cheese with you choice of bread and toppings. They only offer white or wheat bread and it's baked fresh on site each day. The bread tasted really good and was really the best part of the sandwich. The meat and cheese is sliced fresh right in front of you and the veggies are sliced fresh throughout the day. The veggies all looked good except for the lettuce looked wilted and sad, so I didn't get any of that. You can get the \"mix\" of mustard and mayo or if that isn't your thing they can just add regular mayo. The sandwich tasted as good as Port of Subs usually does, average. It's for sure a step above Subway yet there are far better options for sandwiches around town. Port of Subs hits the spot when you are on a time crunch for lunch, want to grab a sandwich to eat at the park, or simply just want something convenient to eat that isn't greasy. Sandwiches also can be ordered as wheat tortilla and lettuce wraps, salads and grilled flatbread sandwiches."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sub today, and was not disappointed. They were a little slow, but my order was correct and very tasty!! I will stop here again!!"}
{"text":"This is the best port of subs. Staff was super friendly, professional and patient. The facility, to include the restrooms, are totally clean. Thanks for the best lettuce wrap!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Every time I visit family in Henderson, I have to get my Port of Subs fix.  I dream about their sandwiches all year long....that's how good they are.  Love the #5.  It has come to the point of obsession because anytime I travel, I always look up if Port of Subs is in the area.    Wish there was one where I live."}
{"text":"The couple that runs this place is so sweet and speedy with your meal! I try to stop by before going in to my closing shift at work and they don't mess around with getting your order accurate and fast! The place is always so clean!  Wouldn't go to any other location!"}
{"text":"Port of Subs is my go-to sandwich place and this is the best location I've been to! It's always clean and the ingredients are always fresh. The owner and the staff are always really nice. They'll know your order and I've heard them remember quite a few frequent customers' orders as well. This location is close to my work and they're quick even if there's a line."}
{"text":"One thing I hate about port of subs, they never give you an itemized receipt. The guy wasn't going to give me a receipt at all. I had to ask twice for it. So if the multiple times I've calculated they have cheated me a $1 or two every time. So done with these people. This guy tried so hard not to give me any receipt at all."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I love port of subs and I usually go to this location since it's so close to my house. The employees here are nice and friendly. I honestly love them more than subway O.o lol"}
{"text":"I always come here. My favorite is the #15 on sourdough. I like to add jalapeños and sports peppers. Good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Getting 2 stars for atmosphere..it's new modern clean.  Staff:  guy nice. Girl rude. Skimped on meat big time...I asked if they'd put a little more on girl said it's fluffed and it just went flat..do I look stupid?  2 slices are 2 slices fluffed or not.  Then she added insult to injury saying if you want more meat it'll cost you 25 cents.  Really?   You'd rather insult a customer and collect a quarter.  We passed on pricipal.  Won't be back.  We frequent pos all over town.  Best ones are rainbow/sunset...jones/ badura,  rancho n if charleston, cheyenne w of rainbow/fwy."}
{"text":"Good subs, good portions depending on if they are busy or not and who is doing the serving."}
{"text":"Last two visits potions skimpy and store dirty...detoured to rainbow location last visit instead of here."}
{"text":"Wow rude!  Hardly put any turkey on bread so I asked can you at least put enough to cover the bread, then he piles it on and tries to charge me for extra meat...but didn't say there'd be a charge, so I refused to pay.  Then he yells just give it to...meaning no extra charge.  But who talks that way to a lady, to a senior and to a customer.  His name began w a p..Couldn't read the rest.  Will NEVER go there again..highly do NOT recommend!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time but it seemed to be run by drug smoking hippies.  You would order, they would lose focus, you would re-order, and it repeated.  If they got the order correct you would be amazed.    I ventured back and no more drug smoking hippies.  Service was friendly, sandwich was as ordered, and I only had to ask for it once.  Totally shocked.  I'm hoping the real staff wasn't just vacationing in Colorado and I just got lucky.   I'm actually going to go back and have another sandwich there so we'll see."}
{"text":"This review is only for Smoothie King; I've had a sandwich from Port of Subs once or twice but I've had Smoothie King numerous times...  I think they might be a little bit more expensive than Jamba or Robeks depending on what you order... I sometimes spend upwards of $5 which is kind of expensive for a smoothie, but I go back because I really enjoy it.  This location doesn't seem the cleanest, but my favorite thing to order is the lemon high protein smoothie - it's always the perfect refreshing snack when I need something to hold me over for a few hours... i love the tart lemon flavor and i don't feel guilty drinking it either!  Depending on your nutritional needs and flavor preference, you can find a smoothie for you... the franchise has existed since the 1980's, so obviously they are doing something right."}
{"text":"I ordered two sandwiches an XL number 1 and a Lg number 5 the XL sandwich was wrapped and in the bag neatly. The Lg sandwich was a bit messy causing the sandwich to literally come out the wrapping and into the bag. We called the store and was told that they wrap there sandwiches really good and it's probably how we take them out. Basically stating that it was our fault. So we asked for the general manager number and was told there register was closed and the phone number was in there to call back the next morning. Really a phone number is locked away she claimed she was the manager. No resolution $25 bucks I spent there yes 1 sandwich was fine but I paid almost $10 bucks for a sandwich in a bag. Waist of money and waist of time calling them."}
{"text":"It's port of subs, the price is right, the service is ok, and it satisfies my belly.  I'm glad it was in the same shopping center of the  place I just left, cause I needed something after what I just ate."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here way more than we really should but the service and food are by far better than any subway or even any other port of subs in las vegas. The manager Dark is super cool and aims to please. He has treated us like VIP customers from day 1. They have set the bar high when it comes to subs and no one else has been able to get close. Keep it up port of subs Eastside."}
{"text":"Pretty decent sandwich, but I stil haven't tried other spots like Wich Wich, Jersey Mike's or Firehouse to determine a favorite. Not a bad place to get a quick bite though, and much healthier  than Mickey D's or Burger King for sure....ALOHA!!!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(2/100) \"Sub-par\""}
{"text":"Never been before so I thought I'd try it out...Its kinda sorta like a subway, but their hook is that they slice their meats to order......WOW!!!!!  People behind the counter looked miserable doing what they were doing...  I ordered a turkey pastrami with everything which was okay, but I still prefer Subway or Capriotti's...they also definitely give you better service for sure...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Marisa and the young man that was working on Sunday were fantastic ... I'm a vegetarian and they really took the time to clean the cutting machine with no problem to get all the meat off ... thank you guys"}
{"text":"Lunch time here is a bit crowded at times. At night this place is a ghost town. The food is pretty much standard, nothing really stands out. Im partial to the turkey and provolone with everything. The employees are always friendly and quick so that's a plus. I have catered from here before for family events and get together's. Their trays are reasonably priced and you can mix and match the sandwiches. They are located near all types of shopping stores. So if you have some errands to run and want a quick bite I would give them a shot.   They carry those supersized cookies and brownies which can be problematic...but everyone needs a treat every now and again."}
{"text":"Good, fresh ingredients, and construction technique. A bit over-priced for portion size, specially considering the low-business-quantity location."}
{"text":"Cant say I've ever had abad sandwich from Port of Subs but this location is now slicing so thin, you can see through them. Also, to put a brand new employee on the slicer during the lunch rush, prob not the best Mgmt decision. Pastrami & Turkey gave the #1(Italian) a whole new taste."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent. Different experience every time. In fact sometimes you can have 2 experiences in 1 visit.   Both of these sandwiches were ordered with double meat. Only one received double meat.   My sandwich was basically bread and that's all."}
{"text":"\"Avocado\" placed in my sandwich. It's not like the staff didn't know. You have to MAKE the sandwich by hand. Can not believe somebody would try to feed anybody this! Never again."}
{"text":"This location is outstanding! Everyone working here is always extremely friendly and in a great mood and the sandwich's they make never disappoint. I am always very happy to come into this location, they are busy sometimes but they handle it very well."}
{"text":"Ehh this location was a bit disappointing...food was good but they staff was a bit slow...the ice in the machine was dirty, had black stuff on it which kinda grossed me out because I had to get ice for my room temperature water bottle I payed for. I love port but probably will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Three stars feels like I am being generous.  You have to order double meat and double cheese (which costs extra) just to get a decent sub.  Employees are generally very stingy with meat, cheese AND condiments....  I have a feeling the stingyness flows from ownership on down, but that's just a guess.    The employees are probably on slave wages...but, employees, here's a \"tip\" for you:  be more generous with the subs and the customers will likely be more generous with the tips thereby enabling you to actually make some kind of money....just a thought.    If it weren't for the fact that there are absolutely no decent restaurants in the area, I would not be coming here."}
{"text":"I love port of subs but it's pretty disgusting that they don't wear hairnets or hats and their hair is barely pulled back when making your sandwich with hair flying all over the place. Maybe they should change that.."}
{"text":"Really good subs! The macaroni salad is good too. Just don't visit this location any later than an hour or so before closing. They tend to start their cleaning very early, and they're very loud about it."}
{"text":"I was hungry for a good pastrami sub over the weekend.  When I go to Los Angeles I always hit \"The Hat\" which ha excellent pastrami dips. Well I went to Port of Subs and hoped for the best.  I ordered a double meat pastrami on whole wheat and when it came to the fixin's left it up to them as they are the sandwich experts.  They finished the sandwich off with provolone cheese, pickle slices and two types of mustard. When I got home and unwrapped it the meat was falling off the sandwich there was so much of it (just like The Hat).  I knew it was a winner from the very first bite.   In closing, I have no idea why anyone would go to a Subway when there is  Port of Subs."}
{"text":"Um the manager was rude to the girls working and to patrons not a fan. He seems like a terrible person to work for and with. One girl came in and he looked her up and down like a piece of meat kind of gross.  The girls were sweet and helpful and patient since literally have not been to a port of subs in probably 6 years or more."}
{"text":"Never been to Port of Subs, have to say, it's a good little sandwich, I ordered a grilled chicken on sourdough bread. Let me tell you the bread was great! If you have great bread how can the sandwich be bad? We have many choices of places to go to for a fast sub sandwich and I am happy to add Port of Subs to my list."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, always fresh ingredients and made to order.  I've been eating here for 4+ years.  Always get the small combo, as the medium is just too much for me to eat.  Bread is baked daily on premise, as are the cookies and brownies.  Always, feel welcome when I walk in this place.  Employees, are friendly and make my sandwich perfectly every time.  Avoid the lunch rush at get there before 12 or after 1:30.  Treat yourself to a brownie or chocolate chip cookie.  They're delicious!"}
{"text":"Always amazing. Service is outstanding. Staff is always smiling and super friendly. I almost always do an online order and they are always exactly how I want!!!! I absolutely recommend this location"}
{"text":"This location does NOT participate with the 5 dollar Friday smoothie special that all the others do. I asked before ordering because I had a hunch they probably wouldn't. And sure enough they don't. So I walked out. They won't get my dollars ever so I went down the street to that Smoothie King--south on Tatum. Go to that one instead. They DO participate in 5 dollar Friday's."}
{"text":"The fact that smoked cheddar is an option is amazing at a sub place. I'm a sourdough lover, the sourdough bread here is really good! The lady who took my order seemed like a genuinely nice and happy person which made the transaction very pleasant. I like the fact that the meat is sliced fresh and the veggies are a higher quality. It's hard to find a sandwich shop that cares about the quality of the \"fillers\" they use to build their sandwiches. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite sammy restaurant chain of all time. I always get the #5 on sourdough... MMM MMM MMM. Great customer service there, only downer is the outdated interior... always a To Go order when ordering from the Boulder Hwy. location. But they are doin' something right! It's always pretty busy in there!"}
{"text":"PoS is by FAR my FAV sub place- BUT we went at 6:30pm & it looked closed (half the lights off, mats up, chairs upside own on the tables, and no employees inside) but the sign said they closed at 8! The door was open, the bell rang when we came in, still no one came out- waited another 30 seconds and said \"hello! Anyone here are you open?\" Girl comes outta the back to take our order, then a male employee comes out of the back and says , \"hey baby, I'm gonna - blah blah blah\" eeeeyeah more like Port of Sex! Gross! At least she wore gloves making my sandwich. Oy !"}
{"text":"This port of subs serves up some pretty good sandwiches, depending who's making them . On this wonderful visit I decided I'd add an 8 oz side of macaroni salad to my sandwich order. All good right? Nope!! The young lady serving me decided that instead of going to the back and getting more Mac salad from the back, that she would give me the last little scoop she had in front. I politely asked her if she was going to add more because I've gotten it here before and its usually a little more. She then proceeds to tell me how she works at another port of subs and that's how they do it! My darling, my sweet Clementine don't argue with the customer , get your lazy little butt in the back and get me some more Mac!! They say the small is 8 oz I went home and weighed it on my handy dandy scale and it was 5.9 really lazy girl??? I'm knocking off 2 stars for my 2/oz."}
{"text":"Great location.  Did a call ahead because we were short for time to get to my daughters class. I didn't realize I was only 5 mins away and expected it to not be ready. It was and Peter the manager was friendly, funny and professional. I told him I appreciated the service and he said thank you very much, not everyone takes time to tell you when you are doing well. I hope this review gets back to him! This will be our regular dinner stop on way to her class.  Thank you."}
{"text":"This location of Port of Subs is outstanding. I ordered sub trays, wraps and a fruit tray recently for an office party. The attention to detail and my preferences were excellent. A phone call from the staff on  the day of the party to clarify my instructions ensured it everything would be perfect.  The customer service was excellent.  We were given a military discount and they even wrote on the plastic cover to the subs: Thank you for your service. I thought this added a personal touch. I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I grew up with Port of Subs in Reno, Nevada so I am very familiar with the brand. My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch. I ordered my old familiar stand by: #1 Italian Sub with provolone,veggies, spices, oil and vinegar. I made it into a meal with barbecue chips and a soda, Mr Pibb. My husband ordered the #18 Roast Beef, Turkey, provolone and veggies, spices, oil and vinegar on sourdough, chips and soda. As usual, they didn't disappoint with fresh veggies, premium meats and cheeses. Great customer service and friendly employees. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Some of the friendliest people I've ever encountered work here. The food is always so delicious, I've never had a bad sandwich or a bad time here. The prices are very reasonable too! 10/10 would eat here again."}
{"text":"I went in today and ordered my usual veggie sub. The place was clean and the service/staff were nice. The veggie sub was great as usual and the food was fresh .. Thanks :)"}
{"text":"We love our Port of Subs! The staff is always friendly and efficient.  Their produce is fresh and they have a good selection of meats and cheeses. They are way better than Subway... you actually get the entire piece of cheese here, not just a half. Their prices are much better than Capriottis and Subway! Their kids meal is great too!"}
{"text":"I love going somewhere and you can trust the people making your food!!! You guys are the best!!!! I've been to one other port of subs and it was just weird!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The service is spectacular, the food is always fresh and the shop is always clean."}
{"text":"I ordered a large roast beef sandwich. I haven't been to Port of Subs in a couple months. There was only 2 paper thin slices of meat on the sandwich. Is that the new way of making the sandwiches?"}
{"text":"I love port of subs! Their ingredients are freshly sliced right in front of you. Everything just tastes so much better. Definitely my favorite sandwich shop around.  This eastern location is the one I usually go to whenever I need my port of subs fix. The employees are very friendly and they always get the order perfect! Love it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Port of Subs, and this location is consistent with the brand. I found the employees to be very friendly and quick to help me. They are generous on every request that I made. I was able to get through the line within a very reasonable time.  If you are from out of town and like Subway you will absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"I just got done eating at this restaurant very nice people that run it now that I have this particular Port of Subs in my memory I will eat here again very peaceful music they play and once again nice people that run it"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised to see the negatives. We have had a good experience here.  Right now I am eating a veggie with so much lettuce I have a little salad on the side. cheeses and avocado are standard  We use all their services; delivery, internet pick-up and stop-in.  Fast delivery, GREAT pick-up, good stop-in. We always order online. The website is easy to use and gives all the options at the store with easy to select choices.  We do always go at night   I also like the macaroni salad and I love the pickles. I wish I knew what kind of pickles or a similar pickle. I love them."}
{"text":"I'm always willing to drive out of my way NOT to go to this place. The subs aren't bad but i'd so much rather have a Jersey Mike's sub. Something about the bread and those wonderful spices... Went to the Warner Rd. location today because my son insisted and the service at 11:30am was friendly and efficient.  The Turkey & Provolone on wheat was kinda bland, but I do love that they have Coke Zero (J.Ms doesn't...Boo!)."}
{"text":"I typically would never write a review about a chain restaurant like this but I feel like everyone needs to know to avoid this location at all costs. My sister was in town and wanted port of subs before she left as they do not have one where she lives. When we got there, there was 2 people in front of us and then the three of us. Finishing the two peoples order in front of us took about 10 min due to the side conversations the employees kept having with each other and the complete lack of organization. Now onto our orders, which was a disaster. My sister and I's order went smoothly, mine you I ordered a lettuce, turkey, and mayo sand which and she ordered something similar, nothing complicated there. It's the third order that really took a turn for the worst. As our third and final order was being made, a family of 5 walked in and the employees looked like they saw a ghost, unable to process that volume of business. The two employees working immediately stopped what they were doing and tended to the family of 5, completely ignoring our third sandwich. Our friends sandwich sat there as a loaf of bread for about 15 minutes as they worked on the people BEHIND us and their order. Our friend asked numerous times why her sandwich wasn't being made to which the employees would start fighting with each other or make an excuse like \"Sorry we're very busy\" or \"Sorry I'm very overwhelmed right now\". We had somewhere to be and the entire purpose of going somewhere like this was to get a quick bite and eat something my sister wanted. It took about 35 minutes to finally get our 3 sandwiches. The employees (younger man brown hair and much older women) were very unprofessional and fought with each other. Overall very very disappointed with this Port of Subs and the lack of service. Also, once we got our sandwiches they tasted terrible. The bread tasted beyond stale and because it had been sitting out for so long the meat was warm. Don't send your business to this location unless you have around 35-40 minutes to spare just waiting for a crappy sandwich."}
{"text":"This place was Whack!  I would rather go to Subway, it would actually be an improvement on service and flavor.    My wife and I went in and apparently they were doing a to go order so we waited about 3 minutes before even being acknowledged, by the way we were the only people in line.  After the 3 minutes we were finally asked what we wanted.  After ordering we noticed a very uncommunicative Manager trying to direct an employee, just a tip, if you want someone to do something you actually have to say it.   Upon check out the same Manager helped us and was still uncommunicative.  Very disappointing that the representative of the establishment doesn't say \"thank you, sorry for the wait,\" or even \"I hope you enjoy your meal.\"  Well if we had enjoyed the meal I may be giving another star, but we didn't.  Maybe it was an off day but we will not be back to test our luck."}
{"text":"Great service and delivery!! Hubby was pleasantly surprised with my choice for his lunchbox, and our roommate loved her Grilled chicken salad for dinner"}
{"text":"Fantastic staff.  Clean.  Very good food.  Classic cold subs.  It's a simple sandwich shop for simple people.  I drive extra milage just to come to this one."}
{"text":"They always make everything fresh we have been to this location so many times every employee remembers our order as soon as we walk in the door, they also are kind enough to make my sandwich first because my husband is vegetarian so they make my sandwich and then they take apart the slicer and make sure it's clean for him. They do it even when it's just him ordering. We have never had a bad sandwich or experience here, the customer service is always above and beyond and it trumps jimmy johns hands down."}
{"text":"I  spend over $100 a month at this location and they have coupons on the wall that they won't honor and tell the next visit even though it never says that on the coupon.  Not cool. I'll go to the other port of subs closer to my house."}
{"text":"This place is getting a 1-star review until the business owner stops charging full price for a tap water. The customer service was excellent but charging me $1.99 for a cup of ice or tap water is ridiculous."}
{"text":"My son loves getting a plain ham sandwich  from this place. Yes, just ham and bread. I love their unsweetened tropical tea. The staff here is always friendly and really takes the time to interact with customers. We were in Monday, late afternoon and both the lady and the guy behind the counter were awesome!!"}
{"text":"We had an event catered and could not have been happier with the service and the quality. Mike and his team go above and beyond to make sure everything is just right! We will absolutely be using them again! Thank you from all of us at Gilcrease Nature Sanctuary!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most amazing sub shops The manager and assistant manager at this location Peter and josh are just amazing this is the only location I will go to highly recommended this place and the #1 and #5 with bacon"}
{"text":"Generous servings. Sandwich is good. Service is good. Would come back for a second visit."}
{"text":"Man please get rid of the rude ass lady that has a serious attitude problem!!! I keep telling myself not to come to this location in hopes that I get someone else but she's always there. Every time I come here it seems like she's training someone, she should be the last person training and she's so rude and can give two f**ks if it's in front of customers."}
{"text":"1st time here and I must say the turkey bacon avacado was really good since it was my 1st time I had to order another sub so I got roast beef , that was fresh n tasty as well. Ive now added this to my list of fav sub shops"}
{"text":"Super tasty subs and salads...and dessert if you so desire! The best thing about Port of Subs is the taste of their food. The sandwiches are flavorful and decently-sized and taste great with their chip variety.  Their salads are huge and you can select from all the sandwich toppings (including meats) which is awesome.  Service is always friendly and helpful, although they can be slow at times so prepare yourself for a bit of a wait during rush hours.  You can get outta here for about $9-10 and it's a decent portion for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This location is brand new! I was welcomed with friendly staff, a very clean restaurant, and a delicious sandwich. I have no complaints. Great location and great everything.   (5/5 stars)"}
{"text":"By far the best Port Of Subs location in Vegas.   Always clean, large, nice employees, and the sandwiches are always great.   My only complaint would be Parking. That's because most of the parking around the restaurant is reserved for surrounding businesses."}
{"text":"Will not be back.  I started having lunch here every day last week (10/30) and was going to continue but then the Manager gave me a hard time about not honoring the HON discount when I forgot my badge today -- went on to TELL me to wear my badge on my shirt \"in a noticable location moving forward or I would not receive the discount\".    Realy? Not smart -- my daily lunch business is going next door to the Greek place."}
{"text":"The online ordering for port of subs is garbage! I put my order in online and It never told me that It went through so I called the store and they told me that It was almost ready even though i didn't tell them my name. When I got to the location It was the wrong order and I had to stand in line 10 minutes to re order everything again"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars.  I had the NY steak and cheese on  ciabatta and I'm pretty sure that dog food would have tasted better.  It honestly tasted like old meat.  You couldn't even taste the cheese.  Eww...just thinking about it is making me nauseous."}
{"text":"Legit ordered delivery... online it says I'm 2.4 miles away on their website google maps says 3.9 they apparently deliver to a 4.0 mi radius ...... not on Fridays cause they took my order told me 25min 10min later call n say we won't deliver that's nice Port of Subs .... thanks!"}
{"text":"Brand new location and it shows! Everything is clean, even the bathroom was super clean. The 2 staff members were very quick with their service and acknowledged everything you ordered on your sub. I really enjoy eating at Port of Subs and this location just made my experience with this chain all the better. I hope they continue with their great service and cleanliness of the restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. The employees make me feel welcome and always greet me. The restaurant is very clean and bright and feels good to relax and have a quick lunch or grab something to go. The brownies are so yummy!! Food is fresh and tastes great! Chips are well stocked and soda station is clean. Bathrooms are also clean. Parking is ample and easy to get in and out of quickly, especially if working and just need to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here. Ordered a vegetarian sandwich which is cheese & avocado and is the same price as a non-vegetarian sandwich. When we asked for more we were told, \"you have more than enough\". The point of having the option to get \"extra\" because the 4 tiny half squares of avocados to us was not enough is to up charge us. We will gladly pay the difference for extra avocado. The employees continued to make a stink about having to give TOO MANY slices of avocados on our sandwich. Even after we told them we'd like to pay for the avocados but instead they whispered about how we're getting away free!?! Omg, charge me for the avocado!!"}
{"text":"Ok. I do not like to do chain food when we have so many local options. But my mom n pop sandwhich places were closed when I wanted to grab a late lunch and hungry so dropped into the nearby Port o Subs for lunch. Service was incredible. The 2 people working the counter were so friendly and helpful. Got the veggie sandwhich and the bread was pretty fresh. Liked my sandwhich but thought I was getting the paper from the wrapping in every bite. When I pulled the paper out of my mouth it was actually the banana peppers! Seriously they were like dried paper.  I think at the end of the day this is a fine chain sandwhich shop if you must."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this location I get the worst service. I walked in there last night around 7:30pm. I knew they closed at 8pm, but the guy was so frustrated that I came in to order my dinner. He was not welcoming and I almost told him to just forget it. He was making sandwiches for the employees and was annoyed I had to order two sandwiches for myself and interrupted him. I wanted one of my sandwiches toasted, he said he already turned off the toaster!!!!! Yes I get you are closing soon, but was pretty upset I couldn't get it toasted nor was he apologetic at all towards me. His attitude made me upset and had made me think twice about ever going back there. And this was not the first time I have had poor customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Port of Subs for over 20 years...if that doesn't say something then I don't know what does.  The quality has stayed the same for that long.  It's never gone downhill.  The price has never skyrocketed. It's been consistently damn good for 20 years.  When it comes to a cold classic sub, there's no better place than Port of Subs.  No $5 foot long gimmicks, just damn good subs!"}
{"text":"I walked in and there was only one other customer, the place was clean and two ladies were behind the counter. I'm pretty sure they were mother and daughter as the younger one had called her \"mom\".  The older woman, Brenda helped me decide what to eat as I've been to Subway but not here before. She first offered a sub that was her favorite but I said healthy than she told me to get the chicken salad. I like that they suggested items they knew and have tried, because I was going to say cold chicken but both insisted I get it warmed.   At first I almost couldn't get the salad as they realized they had no shredded lettuce or the chopped lettuce. But I asked if I could get the spinach leaves as its healthier anyway and I pointed out the chopped lettuce looked old and it was mostly white parts. At first I passed on the tomatoes because they looked ugly but she offered better tomatos that was in the fridge.  She offered this sirachi slaw that was new for free. At first I passed because it didn't look good, but gave in because she was so helpful to me and wanted the feedback. I took one bite and said it was gross. LoL. I think there was too much sirachi in it because it was more red than green as the pictured showed.  I wanted a whole pickle but forgot to ring it up as we were discussing cookies, but as I sat to eat she remembered and just brought me a few slices of pickles.  They were both super nice and great service, if I was on that side of town, I might stop by again. The warm chicken and sharp cheddar she suggested was so good, I could've just ate that."}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since the place opened in the mid 90's.  I use to live a few blocks away.  Since I moved a couple of years ago, I've only been here once or twice a year.  Since I was in the area, I decided to stop by for lunch today.  I ordered the #1 Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips.  The Sandwich was made fresh and tasted delicious!  Solid experience, just like I remember.  Will I return?  When I'm in the area, sure!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Summerlin. Really good staff also. I'm a big fan of the fact that they cut the meat in front of you. Most places have it prepared and it doesn't taste as fresh."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm back in Vegas, I try to drop into my favorite spot.  Port of Subs is one of my favorite Sandwich chains.  This particular location is near my old gym.  I ordered my favorite item:  Number 1 - Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese Chips http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BKN1LNlucLuyZzBzk_68wg?select=0E6ArjiuByfZKbVV0SzFxw#0E6ArjiuByfZKbVV0SzFxw  The food is fresh and tasty.  The employees here have always been friendly and I'm glad to see they still are.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Tell me why it is currently 8:30 on a saturday when the door and yelp both say they close at 9 and when we get to the door all the girl behind the counter does is shakes her head at us saying they are closed umm ok glad this is ok to the owners glad to see your customers come first i dont care how slow you are this is ridiculous"}
{"text":"Popped in here for lunch yesterday because I was in the area.  I ordered a footlong #1 on White Bread (Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese)....see pics.  It was lunch time and I thought it would take a while to make the Sammie....but it didn't take them long.  Unfortunately, the Sammie didn't taste all that good.  I don't know, it was kind of bland and was light on the toppings.  It's strange because I usually enjoy a Port of Subs Sandwich.  Maybe I caught them on an off day.  Overall, I wasn't satisfied with my meal.  Return Factor - 30%"}
{"text":"Being from California, I never heard of port of subs, but I was starving and just drove 4 hours to Henderson. I walked in and was greeted immediately with a friendly face. I had the tuna on white with all the fixings of my choice. Good sandwhich. I got the second size up and had it cut in half. I could only eat half. My eyes were bigger than my stomach. They had alot of choices to put in your sandwhich. Seemed to have a steady flow of people coming in and out for 230pm on a friday but they handled the load well with 3 people behind the counter."}
{"text":"A new Port of Subs near my home. I stopped by this afternoon and picked up a Cold Italian Sub. It was great. The service was outstanding. I am glad that this store opened so close. I'm going to place my Super Bowl Order soon. You should too."}
{"text":"Fast service and good food.  Great for a quick turn lunch.  Their new loyalty rewards card is pretty cool too.  You regiter it online and rack up rewards points for free food later.  Kind of novel for a sub shop.  Only down side is that I think their prices are a little high compared to other sub joints."}
{"text":"Better than subway by slicing the meats  though didn't impress me and tasted subway qualitywise.   Not bad, though nothing special. The bread tasted like subway, the meat was very fatty, and they weren't generous with meats.   I got a ham and swiss, and the cheese had no taste."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are MUCH better than subway's. All their cold cut sandwiches are great, but there meatball is one of the best. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This store is always great. The sandwiches are delicious and this location is one of the cleanest.  Thumbs up to new management, store manager Randy!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 2 foot sub and the manager enters it into the register as two 1 foot subs which is more expensive.  Okay, cool, accidents can happen.  As I lean in to correct him, he hastily slides my card and crumples my receipt as soon as it pops out of the machine.  He then throws it in the trash all while avoiding eye contact.  I was a bit speechless and stunned.  Really?  Over less than two dollars?  He couldn't be that petty could he?  The more I thought about it the more irritated I got, but I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps it was an honest mistake and I'm not one to jump to conclusions nor squabble over two dollars.  But, ten minutes later, another customer orders a 2 footer and calls him out on the same shananigans.  I lost my appetite and wondered what else this manager would do to scrape by a few dollars.  At the least it explained the dry, old-tasting sandwiches.  Yuck..  Bottom line, avoid this one.  Fresh sliced gimmick with a side of dishonesty."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here through grub hub and I'm really happy with it! I work at a port of subs on Jones and Badura and this is seriously really good. I got a grilled chicken Caesar wrap with bacon and it was really good. Props to whoever was working it was nice and hot and fresh. Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile so thought I would give it a shot. Port of Subs always have consistent service and fresh food. I was a little bummed to see they don't offer their rueben anymore but other than that it's still the same (been over 2 years since I left and moved back to PHX). Other than the damn rueben I remembered they have the infinitive choice soda machine which they still have, and I still love. Long story short, this place makes a good sub, a little pricey compared to say Subway, but then again it's Subway. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! We got the #5 and #17 (Ham and Tuna), both of which were really tasty! Their sourdough and wheat are good. The facility was clean and the employees seemed really down to earth. Definitely better service than Subway."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Not too bad not too good. Sometimes u just get a craving for it. It's better than Capriotti's, or Jimmy John's. Not as good as Quiznos, or Jersey Mike's. About the same as Subway or Firehouse. I like that they slice the meats in front of you. That adds a nice touch. Everyone has always been super friendly. Even when I had my kids there, bouncing off the walls, the staff never gave me an evil eye, or even a bad comment. That makes them a 3.5 star, but u can't give half stars."}
{"text":"This is the absolute BEST Port Of Subs in Las Vegas. It is so clean and the people that own it are so friendly and helpful. Did I mention how CLEAN it is? I lived in this neighborhood for years and have come to this location countless times, and I still drive here from my new house all the way out in Mountain's Edge because I love it so much! The only downfall is that they do not accept coupons of any kind. But I don't care. I will drive 20 miles round-trip and pay full-price out of sheer appretiation for their awesomeness."}
{"text":"Justin B. might make the worlds greatest sandwiches. Been here probably 20 times in the last 6 months and have been blown away every single time. Every other Port of Subs I've been to doesn't quite put the same love into their sandwiches as this store. Way to go guys!! Keep doing what you do, and I'll keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They are always pretty nice! The place is always clean, quiet atmosphere and great sandwiches. The veggies always look fresh, and the bread is the bomb. Also, if you have questions about the thickness of the meat cuts (I'm weird) they always answer or adjust. Good customer service! Also, I like that they acknowledge and speak to my little 5 year old when I come in. I hate when places ignore a kid trying to say hi."}
{"text":"Does not adhere to listed hours. Told me they were closed 20-30 minutes before actual close time and their open sign was still on. Which is fine, if they don't want business I'm more than happy to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great sandwhich place to eat, especially with so much competition they really stand out. I have eaten here on 2 separate occasions and have the ordered the #8 both times(Turkey,provolone) with a bunch of extras. The ingredients are fresh and the food doesn't make you feel so Heavy afterwards. Highly recommend especially if you live in the area. I have been there the last 2 Saturdays after 4pm and the staff has always been very friendly and suggestive."}
{"text":"We (YWS) ordered chicken spinach salad. It didn't have the ingredients shown on their website. It only came with the chicken and spinach."}
{"text":"The cashier today was not very pleasant... which is out of the norm for this location.... maybe he was having a bad day...."}
{"text":"This review would have warranted a fourth star, but before writing it I ordered a delivery and it was CRAZY late... so I'm sure there's some work that needs to be done there. I called for my order at 10:30 to be delivered at 12. They said this should be no problem, but then arrived at 12:30, which is when my lunch is over, leaving me lunch-less for the day. :/  On the other hand, the in-store dining experience is fantastic. The food is fresh, and the menu displays options you probably wouldn't have come up with on your own. I like that they can make a KILLER BLT, and even microwave the bacon extra-long when I ask for it crispy. :) The staff were fantastically happy and helpful and made the experience a lot of fun.   We'll definitely eat here again, but I'm hesitant to order a delivery."}
{"text":"Fresh Fresh Fresh an clean an customer service is off the hook. The food here is always so good an fresh. This is I definitely go to place for Port of subs. Every time we go everything looks so fresh and great and the guys behind the counter always have a smile and give great customer service.  The sandwiches we had were great with that just the right amount of stuff and let me tell you they don't skimp on the fixings. So if you like Port of subs I highly recommend checking this one out."}
{"text":"Claud and Tre these two guys are amazing!!!! Great customer service awesome attitudes. I love these sandwiches and these guys just made it so I will always come back to this location!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Port of Subs. It's become one of my regular spots, not only because the food is so tasty every single time, but the staff at this location is on point. They knew my order after having only gone in once. The manager here is great too - they're always so friendly and fast. Never a long wait. Veggies are always fresh. I will return again and again!"}
{"text":"I totally love this location. The staff is so friendly and always make me feel so welcome. The veggies are always fresh and tasty. The owner is also super cool and nice. Every time I go in they seem happy to see me. Everyone should go in and tip them a bunch!"}
{"text":"Top notch customer service!!! I worked as a manager at a 4 star resort for 16 yrs and I was impressed by the customer service that I received from Mariah, Eric and their Manager David!!!   I messed up my on line catering order (tried to change my order but it placed a 2nd one!). It was almost closing time and I called and spoke to Mariah on the phone. Although she did not have access to checking on line orders she assured me that she would personally speak with her manager David and was confident that he could resolve my issue when he arrived the next morning. She said I could call and speak with him in the a.m. but again insisted that I should not worry that the problem would be resolved.   About an hour later after close I received an email saying that a credit was issued back for the double order.  The next day I decided to stop in and speak with manager David to make sure everything was correct. When I entered the store David was assisting another guest but made eye contact to acknowledge me. I was also greeted with a hello from a young man sitting at one of the tables whom I later found out was Eric who worked there and must have been on break or waiting for his shift to start.  When David was finished with the previous guest I told him my name and he immediately knew who I was. He was super friendly and easy to talk to, he went over the orders with me again to reassure me that everything was correct and that my account had been credited. I thanked him and praised Mariah's customer service. He seemed so happy and proud to hear it and said he would pass the praise along to her when she arrived for her shift.   I went ahead and ordered lunch for me and my son and decided to eat there. While we were enjoying our lunch I witnessed numerous people come in and David greeted each of them with such a personal touch, knowing many of their names as I assume they are regulars. Eric was now on shift and was also assisting guests with great customer service using appropriate titles when he did not know their names.   The excellent customer service you will receive at this location is a direct reflection of the excellent leadership David provides his staff! He is an asset to the company and the owners and so is anyone he mentors or trains and he should be recognized for his awesome leadership skills!"}
{"text":"I use to shop at this location a lot... i went there today to get some sandwiches and i was blown away by the lack of customer service these people gave.  We ordered our sandwiches and i watched in disbelief as this guy sliced away.  We ordered medium #7 on white with double provolone.  The cheese was so thin i could see through it.  The double cheese wasn't even the amount of the regular cheese.  The older black woman that came from the back seemed put out that she had to come and help this guy make the food.  She rang us up and then we sat down to eat.  After about 10 minutes she came over to tell us that she didn't ring us up for the extra cheese... my sister pointed at the lack of \"extra cheese\" on the sandwich and she just stared at us.  She said it was $2.75.  She went to the register and came back with a quarter and no receipt.  My sister had to go up to the register and ask for the points for the $2.75 she asked for.  . . Reluctantly... they finally gave them to us... such a disappointment."}
{"text":"As I walk in I stand there and stare at the menu for a few seconds I hear the owner rudely talking down to one of his employees for making a mistake at the register.  She apologized to him but he chastised her for it and continued to lecture her about it.  After he was done bickering I proceeded to make my order.  I ask for an 8 inch on white, he asks what number...I thought he meant what size sandwich so I again say an 8 inch, he rudely asks the same question looking aggravated instead of politely asking what I would like on my sandwich and then dramatically points at the numbered options on the menu as if I were stupid.  His own employees silently apologized to me while putting vegetables on my sandwich and again at the register.  What kind of owner berates his own employees in front of customers and treats his customers this way?  This isn't the first time I have had rude service by this person but it is the last.  **Update** The Port of Subs is a franchise that cares about their locations and services.  Surprisingly I was contacted by a franchise field consultant regarding my review and I am satisfied with the actions taken.  Unfortunately you cannot control every franchise owners poor customer service.  Port of Subs has great sandwiches and I will continue to visit other locations."}
{"text":"The place gave me food poisoning and now thinking back of earlier today the place was like in previous reviews dimly lit and dirty."}
{"text":"I'm like the lover of jersey mikes and my husband and I were out and about and we're staving so we decided to come in and try Ports of Subs now they have a very large sub menu with all ur typical deli meats and sides to go on the sub. I do like that they have the small,medium,large,etc.. u get where I'm going they have different sizes which is great. So my husband got the #1 and I got a turkey (don't remember the # sorry) both on wheat bread. Let me tell you the bread is yummy and fresh like as if it was baked that day. So yummy and fluffy. As for deli meats/cheese they slice right there and then the toppings they have your typical lettuce,onion and tomato but you can also get pickles that are amazing, cucumbers, spinach, olives and some other yummy toppings. Also that I really liked they have a mayo mustard combination already so you don't half to have a layer of mayo and a layer of mustard.it's already mixed together which I really like a lot. If I'm ever on that side of town again or if I'm just craving a sub I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Quick line but the sandwich was made terribly and the customer service was poor  Food was ok, fresh sliced but the bread was flat and dry"}
{"text":"When you have pregnancy cravings and all you want is a classic #2 (ham,turkey). nothing to fancy and you order online get your order come home and it's totally the wrong sandwich. I called in to say it's the wrong sandwich and if she can remake it was told I had to wait because there were other orders ahead of me. NO I don't want to wait I want you to remake my sandwich and do it fast thank you very much. Ok rant over."}
{"text":"Great food with wonderful employees! I've gone out of my way to go to this location if I'm needing a sandwich fix. I don't even mind the lunch rush because of the service I get! Beats subway any day."}
{"text":"I believe this is the correct location..this is for the Port of subs on Stephanie and Sunset by Wells Fargo...either way.   My husband and I came in to Port of Subs and we were SO surprised by the amazing service we received! Usually you don't expect to have a conversation with the person who is making your food or to be greeted warmly or to be thanked. It was a shock! Not only that but the meat and cheese was prepared right there so there was no watery residue on my sandwich ( much nicer than subway). We will be continuing customers! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Read the other reviews for Port of Subs and I think context is important here. We're not just talking about a sub joint, because you can definitely find better ones anywhere. This particular Port of Subs is in an airport, and when it comes to airport food, you know it's going to be over priced, and under edible.   So with that in mind, I'd say this place hits the spot. I didn't have to take out a loan to buy a sub. And I swear the meat was real meat. That's at least 2 thumbs up there.   The only issue I had was that when they ask what condiments and toppings you want, you are scratching your head at what's available because it's all placed behind a shield that doesn't let you see any of it. So I simply said I want it all, hoping that they don't sprinkle on top something crazy like Skittles."}
{"text":"Port of subs is my favorite subs place! Freshly sliced deli meat and soft bread. They also deliver which is awesome! Definitely on top of the sub chain places."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Sandwiches are great every time! They also will grill the wraps for you- which makes them even better. Cookies are a nice treat also. Always soft and fresh. You are always greeted as soon as you walk in the door, and the staff makes sure that they are hustling to get their customers fed as soon as possible. Ingredients are always fresh and ripe. Facility is exceptionally clean and neat. Best Port of Subs in town, hands down!"}
{"text":"for the record this place is so much better than subway!  i love the meat and cheese.  not alot of veggies to choose from but that is okay.  the sandwich as a whole is freakin good.  the sides are good but a little pricey.  now i'm hungry again."}
{"text":"There was a long hair in my husband's sandwich.  He only discovered it by pulling it out of his mouth. DISGUSTING! There are sanitation requirements that are clearly not being met here!"}
{"text":"After moving into the area, I have been curious about what places near me have decent food. Now I do love me some sammiches. I usually get nervous about chain places, but this way a different story.  Decor: some chairs and tables for getting a quick bite. Music plays in the back ground. When you go to order, small menu with customization available.  Food: so I got the #14 with pastrami. The meat was sliced fresh, so was the cheese. The bread is baked fresh daily according to them. It tasted amazing, and fresh. I was pretty impressed with the quality I received and paid for.  Customer service: not much to say here, it was ok?  Overall: I do love subs and I will be going back there again. Hopefully it's going to be just as good tasting."}
{"text":"After work I came in to port of subs to use their bathroom.   Everyone came out to greet me. So friendly. Gorgeous staff. (Inside & out((radiant))) excellent customer service skills. Or should I even call it that.   They desired to be friendly & accommodate me. I then waited for my ride & they offered me a drink! How sweet of them.   Stayed around made sure I got picked up. I don't make much but I tipped them all that I had.   Amazing staff. I hope they get to see this! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"-15 stars goes to this place!   I had the worst experience here a couple months ago & I promised to never come back. But did! Same result!!!!!   I waited in line for 45 minutes..  Finally got up to the cashier, whom had been incredibly busy ignoring me for his phone. I asked him if he was going to ring me up or if I should come back.  Again, ignored. Everyone there was flustered. People started walking out of the store & so I stayed because they obviously weren't getting much money with the shitty attitudes.   After then speaking up, he yells to me: \"cash or card? because our machine is broken!!!\" I lost it. I left so fast. So did everyone else! This is infact the worst place to go. I tell everyone to stay far away from this disgusting business.   Their meat wasn't up to par the turkey they put on my sandwich was slimy & had spots all over it! Expired? Low standards, cmon now!  Though, there was one person who tried to help me, a tiny Asian girl. Whom seemed new & in guidance of the veterans there who didn't appreciate her one bit.    I have hope for you, tiny Asian girl.   But as the rest of the staff here, you guys are the awful! Work on your customer service skills!"}
{"text":"I was shocked to find out they served breakfast here and all day long. I ordered a turkey sausage sandwich and it was quite yummy. Might have to swing by for actual breakfast at breakfast sometime. Service was fast, place was clean, lunch was inexpensive."}
{"text":"I used to be a waitress so of all people I'm the most understanding of the craziness in the food business, but my visit here was so disappointing. There were 4 people working with only one customer in front of me. It took maybe a minute just to be acknowledge as I stood there just staring at them. I wasn't greeted nicely either, there was no hey how are you? It was just what can I slice for you. I asked for wheat and I got white. Since I got a small I asked for little mayo and I got a giant glob. I understand feeling like you have the worst job ever, however, at least have some sort of personality and be nice please."}
{"text":"I think that Subway is awful and this place is worse.  They have bland sandwiches and then for some reason they squish them.  I guess that is their thing, but it's not good."}
{"text":"This location is near my work so when I don't bring my lunch this is usually my go-to place.  Port of Subs does not have the \"Wow\" of Capriottis or some of the other non-chain places but I know what I'm getting and without an insane amount of calories/points.     This location is spotless and the owner (I don't know her name) is friendly, cheerful & gracious (unlike some of the other sandwich establishments where the apathetic-usually-teenaged-or-unmotivated-20-something-staff could care less about you or your order and in most cases screw your order up...)   They also have freshly brewed ice-tea!"}
{"text":"I order from here at least once a week and I've never been disappointed. Their subs are always fresh and the staff is very friendly and professional!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Port of Subs! The owners, Karissa and Michael, were super friendly and the sandwich was delicious! Happy to see a new Port of Subs around!"}
{"text":"What I love about this place:  You can submit an order online and go pick it up without having to wait in the long lunch line!  Thank god for the internet.  The staff is efficient for the most part.  The sandwiches are made to order and they have outdoor seating.  It's close to where I work so I come here often."}
{"text":"I figured when I write reviews, I would try to keep it to new and different locations that people may or may not have been on the fence to try.  However, after frequenting this location for years, I have to write about this shop.  As far as a Port of Subs go, this is the best!   Port of Subs food has a great fresh taste that will blow any Subway away.  However, this particular location tastes even better than any other Port of Subs I've been to!   I order my usual #18 Roast Beef, Turkey and Provolone on wheat and am never disappointed in the years I have been coming here.  I think that what really makes this location stand out from others is the service which is impeccable!  The owner Damon I swear is always here working each time I come in.  I am pretty sure he lives at the shop or at the very least never takes a day off.  I always find him behind the counter making sandwiches and chatting it up with patrons.  Always, always has a smile on his face and may be the nicest guy in the business.  I have to attribute the quality of this location that includes the taste of the food, the always clean dining area and the suburb level of service I get to this guy's managerial style and hustle.   Looking for a lunch time place with great service and awesome tasting food?  Port of Subs on Stephanie and Sunset is can't miss!"}
{"text":"Chris and serenity were great.  Customer service was A++++++++++++++++++ I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I came in on June 19th around 1:15pm, the sandwich quality is really good, never had a problem with bad ingredients. Especially the pepperchinis, greatest sandwich topping on gods green earth. However, the staff is absolutely horrible, just about every single one of them. Especially the Girl who usually who works the cash register. She has an attitude every time I come in and has never once handed me the sandwich, I have to reach across the counter and remove it from the bag holder myself. She also doesn't say have a good day or anything and could care less about her job. The managers are just as bad, worst customer service at just about any establishment I've been too, and it's only this location."}
{"text":"No public restroom.  I'm sorry, but a restaurant with no restrooms should not be allowed to operate.  It's insane and there are no other businesses in the area with restrooms so you're out of luck if you have to go."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new Port of Subs and because it is so close to my work, it is also the one I go to most often. I like Port of Subs,  but if other sandwich shops were closer to my work I would probably go to them more often.  So why the high review? The owner and employees of this specific location are great. Some of them have helped me enough times that they know what I am going to order, and I always love that.   This location delivers as well!"}
{"text":"I usually dont frequent restaurants with more than one location or two. But tonite we stopped in here and experienced some of the best customer service and effort put into making sandwiches ive ever had. We were greeted immediately upon walking in and the two young men working even interacted and complimented  my daughter.  Ill definitley be back."}
{"text":"Came in on a sunday. Game was on. Great food, always fresh. Good talk.  Always clean.  Sam is super nice.  We recommend  this Port of Subs."}
{"text":"1. Port-of-subs is one of the best sandwich franchises. Everyone may rave on and on about other franchises that aren't on the national level (I tend to not list competitors in reviews, but you can easily imagine who I'm talking about), but they don't match the selection and combinations you can get.  2. This location is great. Damen, the owner and manager, is a great guy who remembers your face and favorite sandwich and someone who obviously enjoys what he does for a living. He got me all set with party trays for my son's first birthday, told me where I could save money in the order, and never tried for an up sell."}
{"text":"My sister ordered online and when we got there one of the guys working said they hadn't received an online order. After showing them the order confirmation on the phone we asked if they could refund it or just make the sandwich since it was already paid for. They said they couldn't refund it because they didn't have the order and of how the system on the computer works. We asked if they could make it and the lady working said she would but one of the guys working said they would charge us for it, which is ridiculous because it was already paid for. We double checked the confirmation and it was the right store, time, and date so it was their system that messed up. They still refused to make it and after asking again for them to make it they finally said they would but they need a printed bank receipt to prove it was paid even though we showed them the online receipt. The lady working was kind but the two men working were very rude to us. We've never gone to this Port Of Subs, we've always gone to a different one and never had issues there, so the people at this location are the issue."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst port of subs ever. Jaymie is BEYOND rude.. Rolled eyes, skimped on ingredients, etc. you're better off going to jersey mikes down the street! Thank you Jaymie for your resting B face, I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Cleanliness is not a priority.....  My family used to frequent this location often as it is close to the house. However, something happened where they stopped cleaning things regularly  apparently. The last time I was in, I ordered then looked down at the grossly messy slicer with a variety of misc things on it and promptly cancelled my order.   I wouldn't have bothered with the review but it has been consistently a mess behind the counter when I have gone in and it's to the point where now if I want Port of Subs, it has to be a different location for me."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for sandwiches.  I used to love Subway until coming here. You just can't compare the freshness to Subway. Everything is freshly sliced on the slicer and their bread (which can make or break you) is soft and compliments the meats well.  I have never seen such fast service, especially when they're literally cutting all the meats and cheeses on the spot!   Overall, if you are looking for fast, fresh, delicious, healthy, affordable food, try them out."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see good reviews here. This location looked dirty, and the service was average at best. Now, this is the first and only Port of Subs I've been to so maybe this place has a better reputation elsewhere, but this location wasn't helping their cause. Honestly, the food wasn't good either. Probably the lowest quality ingredients I've ever had at a sandwich place. The sandwiches are simple, but not in a good way -  they don't taste fresh enough to get away with it.  Also, the store seemed drab, with nothing to make it look cool or comfortable. It was like they were cutting corners in certain areas in order to make up for it elswhere, only I couldn't tell in which area they were trying to make up for it. With so many good quality sandwich places out there, do yourself a favor and go down the street to Capriotti's, Jimmy Johns, or even Subway and get a way better meal for the same price."}
{"text":"Clean, fast, and delicious.  Today was the 1st time we'd ever had Port of Subs and we were very impressed. We ordered online and picked up about 15 mins later.  Im interested in trying their breakfast pressed sandwiches."}
{"text":"The most unfriendly service!! As I waited to give my order not a hello or what can I get for you. Just a stare like I was bothering her!!! The bread was not the usual quality I am used to from port of subs. Then when it came to topping it she just stared at me like I'm suppose to just know she is waiting for me to speak. Then as I get to the register the gentleman was much nicer and rings my order up. He walks away as the female half bags my sandwich and then engages in a conversation with another employee who just arrived. I then have to reach action the counter and get my own food. Not a have a nice day. A thank you. Will not be back. I can get rude anywhere."}
{"text":"Restrooms are for customers only means that you have to pay for all of your food before they allow you to use the restroom. So I go in and ask if I can use the restroom, first they lie and say there is someone using it, then say you have to be a paying customer... I said... I prefer to go to the bathroom and wash my hands first. \"We can make your food and hold it for you while you go.\" Really? I clarified by asking if I have to pay for my food first before they would allow me to use the bathroom to which they said yes, I promptly left. I walked to Albertsons, across the parking lot, used to restroom, went to the deli, returned to my car parked in front of Port of Subs and left."}
{"text":"The bread was soft and everything was freshly sliced. It's right by the light rail station and a couple bus stops. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great homemade tuna salad. Nice folks. Great price.   This is in a swanky convenience shop with deep beer selection including many craft brews.   Also airline workers get a discount here."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last week and I have to say I was surprised! It was so delicious!! The ham sub was great. Flavor was on Point and they toast it for you."}
{"text":"Very fast service and I love their subs always fresh and not too greasy.  By sobs before from their competitor and I realize that the tuna is much better here and the vegetables. When I buy subs outside this is where I go."}
{"text":"Eh... My husband always has talked about this place and was excited to try it. Not a fan, I think I'll stick to subway. I had the tuna sandwich pressed on the panini. It wasn't even that warm of a sandwich, my sandwich fell apart and the tuna was bland. I added onions and pickles on it, had to re warm it up and make it crispy in my own oven at home.  I also wasn't a fan of them making my sandwich on the counter.. Every where I have gone to eat a sandwich always have had some kind of paper underneath. Gross...."}
{"text":"Hit or miss here. Depends on the crew working. The weekday crew seems to have it more together than the weekend crew. Sandwiches are good and we like the potato and macaroni salad."}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times and it never seems to change. The place is full of slow workers that ask 2-3 times over and over again about your order. The place always has dirty tables, and trash is always overflowing. Fruit flies flying around...Place is gross. I love port of subs but this location is off limits for me for now on!!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and I stopped coming here for a while because the last time I went the manager and and an employee (two white guys) were arguing in front of everyone and the managers girlfriend came while we were there which seemed to be picking him up and then they both started complaining about the employee. It made my daughter and I uncomfortable.  Well my fiancé and I came back today (it's been at least a year) and there are these two employees (a male and female) who weren't paying attention to us while we were ordering our food as we are saying \"mam, mam, that's not the bread I asked for\" or asking the male to cut my two foot long sub into thirds being a problem. I'm pretty sure I'm paying for my food not you, I'm also sure I'm the one eating it and not the people making it, so it'd be nice if they were listening and didn't look at me crazy when asking to cut my sandwich.  Although I LOVE the number 5 and all it's Smokey cheddar deliciousness I don't think I will be returning to this port o subs or any other location.  I believe you seriously need to re train all your employees and keep an eye on them because this isn't the first time and probably not the last.  This is disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm in love with port of subs, but this location was very disappointing. Horrible customer service, lady barely even spoke to us, and was not wearing a hair net nor gloves. I later found a black hair in my sub.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed, poor service and a small amount of meat piled in the center I asked for White American I think she put Cheddar on it.   If I would have saw her doing it I would have stopped her to put something else on it instead but she had her back to me.  I know it's fast food but if you have a tip jar out you better expect I expect a better job then just the one you get paid for!  I probably won't come back I think I would rather get in my car and drive a bit for lunch at work."}
{"text":"Never been here before but the sandwiches are so so good! A few people are slow but the manager Tina is really fast and very nice. She apologized for the long lines and greeted us. I will be back!"}
{"text":"April 10th 2018 around 6.13-6.30pm  went to this location with my wife we asked wheat breads all the wheat bread they took are already flatted, so I told the lady ok then give me a white bread coz those are not good looking, I asked avocado the white girl working on the place she told me we don't have avocado only mashed avocado I asked what's the reason? She said coz customer complaints because of avocado falls of from the sandwich  ? I asked how come last week I took avocado from flamingo and koval gas station location? She said they are franchise and they do what they want to and doesn't care about the company said! I didn't care so it's none of my business so when she prepare my sandwich I saw little bug  on the mashed avocado & my wife  told her there's a small insect  like ant she check and she told me oh yeah let me remove and she took it to back and came kind of mad manor/attitude & told me you know what the flamingo and koval location has so many bugs you guys don't see!! Come on did I asked and why you talking like that same company you are working??  People this place is the worst place in Vegas valley I never go to this place please stay away from this location"}
{"text":"At first glance it seems to be typical sub shop, but with fancy couches and tv's, takes your sandwich experience to the next level. Top with great friendly service and a tasty sandwich, how can you lose."}
{"text":"Love the option of making a sandwich a wrap! Freshly sliced cold cuts is sooo much better than presliced. The service is always great and exceptional!"}
{"text":"This is a really nice Port of Subs!  My hubby loves Port of Subs, so we eat at them regularly all over town, whenever he gets the craving.  Some are yucky, some average, but this location was just lovely.  The staff at this location was extremely nice, the store was spotless, and the service was super fast.  The trifecta of fast food places, right?  I am boring and always get the #1. I call it the Italian meat buffet because it is loaded with pepperoni, salami, capicolla, ham, and provolone on bread and it is fantastic.  I am drooling just thinking about it!  I am kind of anti-veggie, so I go with just the meat, cheese, extra mustard/mayo spread, and all of the seasonings.  It is tasty!  I like how everything is sliced fresh for your order.  The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at Subway.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well.  I am just happy with my jalapeño chips though and really haven't tried the other items.  My hubby likes their cookies and brownies though and he gets at least 1 every time we are there.  Overall if you want a sandwich quick, this is a great location to grab one and go."}

{"text":"So, I am a Vegas girl.  I lived there for 25 years and love all things Vegas.  I recently moved to Texas due to my hubby's job.  Sadly, there aren't any Port of Subs in this state.  So sad...   I was recently back in Vegas visiting family, so I had to get my Port of Subs fix one day while I was there.  This was actually a new location for me, but it was great none the less!  Here's the scoop:  This is a nice Port of Subs location.  When we lived in Vegas, we ate at them regularly all over town, due to our addiction to the mayo/mustard sauce.  Some locations are yucky, some fantastic.  I think this location was pretty good, in my opinion.  The staff was nice and friendly.  They seemed actually happy, not just pretending.  They were really busy when I was there since it was the lunch rush, but they handled it great.  Yay for happy staff!  Now, for the food!  I am boring and always get the #1. I call it the Italian meat buffet because it is loaded with pepperoni, salami, capicolla, ham, and provolone on bread and it is fantastic.  I am drooling just thinking about it!  I am kind of anti-veggie, so I go with just the meat, cheese, pickles, extra mustard/mayo spread, and all of the seasonings (salt, pepper, oregano, oil, vingear).  It is oh so tasty!    My hubby always get the #2, which is the turkey, ham, and cheese.  He loves it and is always a happy camper afterwards.  I guess we just know what we like!  My kiddo always gets the kid's grilled cheese.  It's a tasty grilled cheese too, since they make it on a panini press.    I like how everything is sliced fresh for your order.  The veggies, even though I don't eat them, all look fresh and much nicer than the veggies at some other sandwich chains.  The bread is always flaky and fresh and tastes great.  They always have a huge selection of sides as well with about 10 chip types, cookies, and brownies.  I am just happy with my jalapeño chips though and really haven't tried the other items.  My hubby likes their cookies and brownies though and he gets at least 1 every time we are there.  Overall if you want a sandwich quick, this is a great location to grab one and go.  Now I need to go crawl into a ball and cry because I'm 1200 miles from the closest Port of Subs."}
{"text":"Unlike others, I don't take off a star for service unless it affects the quality of my food. People in the food industry are always in bad moods and I give them wiggle room.  Did anyone else know these guys deliver? Delivery charge is $1 if your order is under $15 bucks and free over that. They have a 5 mile delivery radius.   Ordered two times here now - Pastrami delivered, NY Steak in store. Both were very good.   The Pastrami gave me no surprises. The steak was not strips of steak but rather thinly shaved steak if you're wondering.   The Pastrami took 25 minutes from call to doorstep delivery. It was still hot.   Good quality subs, prices seem fair. Their bread tastes a little more \"artisan\" than Subway."}
{"text":"I called this Port of Subs thinking it was another location. I ended up ordering from them anyways because the guy on the phone was so nice! I ordered a few sandwiches and asked to pick them up at a later time. I asked for all the toppings on the side. He said that wouldn't be a problem. I ended up calling about 20 minutes before pickup to add another sandwich to my order. He was so nice about it. When I got there. They had the sandwiches made, all the toppings in containers and everything bagged up. They put it all in a box and even carried the box to my car! The two young men working inside were so friendly and helpful. They even cut the sandwiches in small pieces because I had mentioned I was feeding kids. I can't say enough good things about my experience at this location. It isn't the shop closest to my house so I'm not sure how often I will visit but it was a very pleasant experience. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I m so obsessed with their sweet iced tea!!! Of course their sandwiches are so clean and tasty! I find it somewhat healthy to eat here and any other sandwich places! But that sweet tea is almost the same as sweet tea from Cane's chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Port of Subs is decent. It is not great, not bad, just okay. They do freshly slice meats and cheeses which is a step up from the pre-packaged, slimy looking meats that they serve at Subway. On my most recent visit I had a buffalo chicken grilled sandwich with ranch and jalapenos. It was served warm, pressed like a panini. I was hoping that it would have deli sliced chicken and not pre cut chicken pieces but it had the chicken pieces. I have had bad experiences with this type of meat in the past so I was a little worried. To my surprise, it was very tasty. I have also had the Italian #1 sandwich here which is also very good. The bread is not the best I have had but not bad.  I have had pretty good customer service when I have been in. I do feel like the sandwiches here are a little overpriced for what you get. For a small sandwich, chips and a drink it comes to around $9.00. I think that is a little much for the quality of food that you get. Overall Port of Subs is an okay choice if you are wanting a sandwich in this area. There are a few other good options in this area as well. Not sure whether I will be back or not."}
{"text":"Yikes! I had high hopes for this place, and I was disappointed.  The customer service was awesome, which is what the 2 stars are for.  The food was not good.  Less quality then Subway.  I got a vegetarian sub on wheat.  The bread is horrible.  no strong and thin almost.  The veggies were ok.  My mayo was kinda warm? blahhhh! Not very good at all, I will not go back."}
{"text":"NOTE UPDATE ON BELOW INITIAL REVIEW:  Went in for a sandwich today.  I asked for it To be toasted and Reconfirmed with the girl twice.  She then made my sandwich and forgot so went ahead and toasted the entire sandwich including the MAYO.  I asked politely to have the sandwich remade and she said \"Fine, whatever ok\", she them proceeded to help the other people in line and said I had to wait.  Wow.  Horrible customer service and after 25min and no sandwich I left.  UPDATE: The business manager replied and was sincere about addressing the situation. Impressed to say the least.  I will reply when I have the chance as weekends leave me not much time for this.  I appreciate the  reply and will get back to you and your questions this week.  Thanks"}
{"text":"They seemed like they had a lot of new people working there and they messed my order up. I will give them another shot and see how the service is. I really like the subs when they are done right."}
{"text":"If I wanted bread and lettuce i would become a vegetarian or go to subway.  I was impressed that they cut the meat right there, they just don't put any of it on your sandwich.  I literally took the 2nd half of my sandwich and folded the meat and cheese over, scooped out a handful of lettuce, to make a 1/4 sandwich that was decent.  Staff was friendly.  Do yourself a favor and go another block and a half and go to firehouse."}
{"text":"This Port of Subs is by far the best I've been to. Great customer service, friendly employees and great sandwiches. I've been to other Port of Subs around Vegas and this location always exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"You guys should be ashamed! One thin slice of salami all bread really how do you guys even get away with this stuff???"}
{"text":"service sucks they were pretty rude here. i believe it was their manager that seemed very irritated and was rushing me and raising her voice at me. unnecessary behavior on her part. will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"My daughter's absolute favorite sub shop -- it's not to die for, must-stop quality, in my opinion, but it's definitely a good sub!  We're here at least once a week on they way home from dance and it's both convenient and quick.  Bread and veggies are always fresh at this location which as easy as that sounds, makes a huge difference to me!  It's clean, cool and has one of those awesome soda machines with a gazillion different mix-it-up flavors!  The folks at this location are also very friendlly, very kind and will do what they need, to make your order right everytime.  Customer service is always worth exra stars for me!!"}
{"text":"Currently 6 months pregnant and I love that I can come here for a veggie sub and I don't even have to ask for them to clean their slicer - they do it automatically! The service is what keeps me coming back and the only sub shop I'll visit while pregnant."}
{"text":"First time at a Port of Subs, I called ahead of time for a pick up, when I got there they haven't even gotten to my order. The girl who made my sub had gloves on, but she also started wiping the counter with a dirty rag, dusting off the counter with her gloves on, and then wiped the knives with that same rag she used to clean the counter, then went back to making my sandwich without changing her gloves!! I thought it was really unsanitary."}
{"text":"I am soooo happy this location is open ! Super clean and Antonella couldn't be friendlier ! Great location too ! I REALLY hope that someone opens a 24 hour port of subs in Vegas soon so I can eat great and fresh sandwiches anytime because let's face it people subway is disgusting !"}
{"text":"I always prefer to support the local businesses but Subway is better."}
{"text":"Just your run of the mill, overpriced, below average airport food.   Got a bland turkey sub for like $10, and an egg and cheese for $6 which wasn't bad.   Just average food.   The staff was all over the place and very unorganized. The cashier stopped taking our order halfway through, walked away and filled up a soda for the previous person in line. Very random and scattered."}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience tonight with the Port of Subs at 3720 E Sunset. The Yelp eat app sent the order to the wrong Port of Subs. When I arrived at this location and I did not have an order I called the other location to be polite. They were rude but the employees at this Valle Verde location made up for the others."}
{"text":"This Port of Subs is the worst I've ever been to. Dirty, filthy and the employees on tonight should never work with the public.They are so rude I let them keep their food. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Came to grub on some sandwiches and they are out of pickles and literately out of bread. Who the hell runs out of white bread and sourdough and wheat bread. That's an essential part of making a sandwich. Will not come back!"}
{"text":"They should get 5 stars for STUPID!!! I've seen stupid before but not like this. I ordered 4 sandwiches thru Bite Squad online service. Except for the Chicken Caesar wrap, they blew them all. It specifically states these include mayonnaise, purple onions, etc....I got 3 empty sandwiches!! When I called a girl who sounded 12 replied there were no extras on the Caesar wrap so she figured I didn't want sandwiches with any taste to them..Can you say STUPID?? No manager on staff either.A 3rd call and they claimed he was on his way in to call me..He never did. Girl should be fired!! The Bite Squad has claimed to reverse the order charge. If not I will of course call my credit company and dispute this. Imagine ordering a sandwich in a restaurant. It says that it comes with all these normal items..Then they bring you a sandwich that's as plain as bread and meat..You tell them bring it back.Then a waitress explains \"Well you didn't order any extras on your other sandwich so I thought you wanted nothing on all the others\"...I will never order from them again...This is what happens when 10 yr olds work for you..."}
{"text":"Terrible. For the same cash you can get a better subway or jersey mikes sub and good customer service."}
{"text":"We came to eat lunch, and the employee Rome was by himself working. He did an AMAZING job. Awesome service! He worked as hard and as fast as he could with a smile on his face and good manners. HE DESERVES A RAISE!! Thanks again Rome! You're great!!"}
{"text":"For some reason, this place just doesn't pack the same goony goodness that the location on Charleston does. It's all the same ingredients, same decor, same EVERYTHING-- I just don't get it?  The staff is real nice, we went in today and it was one of those days where we came at the right time bc as soon as we sat down after we ordered, everyone in the neighborhood seemed to be hungry at the same time and the line wrapped around the restaurant. Unfortunately the staff seems to get quite overwhelmed with the lunch rush, doesn't seem like they're very used to it by the looks on their faces and the frantic-ness felt around that time. It was to the point to where they ran out of 2 different sodas and they couldn't send someone to go to the back and take 2 seconds to change out the syrups.   Like I said, for some reason even though this restaurant has the same everything, seems like the location on Charleston has some secret ingredient that they're not sharing with this location."}
{"text":"I'm not seeing too much of a difference between Subway and Port of Subs. I want to say that my cold cut combo that had some great meats in it did in fact taste better than Subway's version, but I'm not sure why. Maybe it's cuz they overloaded my sandwich with more mayo than I wanted, and that was actually a good thing.   The one difference might be that they offer sourdough bread here as an option. I don't recall Subway having that.   Fast service, and decent deals for large sandwiches. Worth trying if you're in the mood for a sub sandwich."}
{"text":"Holy crap is this the worst port of subs ever!! I walked up to get a sub and see two girls outside the restaurant, sitting on top of a car and making out. They looked up at me annoyed, but I just ignored them and went inside. Seconds later, they came begrudgingly in the store and started making my sandwich. I hear one of the girls say under her breath \"can we have one hour without another guest?\". Are you effing kidding me? Not to mention the sandwich they made was sloppy af.  Can they please get fired? Cause making out all day sure isn't working all day.  I don't know both girls names but from my receipt I know one of them is Moni."}
{"text":"This place sucks! It looks like a family is running this store. My boyfriend and I went in and instead of having the normal shredded lettuce that they normally have, we had big, chunky, bitter romaine lettuce that they probably had just bought from a grocery store that morning because they ran out.   Another time we had drove to the drive thru to order and no one came on. We had to call the store to let them know that we were outside waiting for about ten minutes.   They also make the sandwiches very sloppy and lack on the toppings given. And the workers usually have an attitude. The manager/owner is the most greediest with the sandwiches and will not cut you the correct sized sandwich. Barely enough meat to even go across the bread.   Overall, this place is trash. Don't go there. You'll be disappointed in your sandwiches."}
{"text":"I Love Port of Subs! It is an easy way to get my kids to eat Spinach. My kids also love Miguel because he is very engaging and makes them feel special. It easy to order a sandwich and goodies when they are distracted. The environment is relaxing so I tend to eat in. They have really comfy couches and big screen TV that make you want to stay a bit longer. My kids get upset if I go to another location now."}
{"text":"Love it here. The food is delicious ! I think id come here everyday if my kids didnt mind lol. The number 1 is the best with everything... Of course! And dont forget the chips! Cant have a sandwhich without chips."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and absolutely love it. Is it perfect? No, but it's still fantastic every time. They are new so still trying to train and find the right people, but the food is fresh and tastes awesome!"}
{"text":"SLOW.  Took 20 minutes and only 3 people in line.  Workers were distracted talking about person stuff and call in orders, which caused them to not remember orders.  Workers kept apologizing, so they are nice, but I will go to a different store with family.  If it is going to take this long, I will can have a nice sit down meal for the 9$ it costs for a meal deal.  Sandwiches are fine, just to slow to go to. The best locations are at the Village Circle store and the location at Lake Mead and Rampart."}
{"text":"Sorry Port of Sub but , I ain't eating here anymore. I work in the offices behind it and I've watched them chinch the heck outta peoples sandwich's.  The ladies are nice that's not the issue for me. When you slice a dang piece of cheese so thin that it breaks and then put that on someone's sandwich like it's a full slice REALLY? And the meat too, I wanna ask them,Yo can you slice me a regular slice of meat and cheese wow let me get my moneys worth."}
{"text":"Been to this port of sub location and they are always closed at 6pm and on the door says 7pm."}
{"text":"Very affordable and great for a quick stop during work hours. Nothing can wrong with their combo options:) their chicken breast with provolone cheese is my favorite . I have also tried other ham sandwiches. Quick fast and easy lunch pit stop! Will be stopping by more frequently."}
{"text":"The manager who I am guessing is the franchisee is the most consistently rude, bland and unfriendly person I have ordered from from any fast food chain. Today was the last day I'm willing to be treated like that. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs. I really do. It is close to the house, but not my favorite. They offer everything as other Port of Subs locations. However, their hours are not as long, and they do not honor the Loyalty Card.  Other than that, the restaurant is very clean and the staff (usually the same woman every time I come here) is very friendly and very helpful.  It is always quiet here, so I don't know if they do a lot of business or not."}
{"text":"This just may be the friendliest Port of Subs I've ever visited. We came in the day after Christmas after stopping by both Big Lots and Target which happen to be in the same shopping center. We had been here before, but it had been a long time ago, before we lived on this side of town.  The first thing I noticed was how festively decorated this place was. All the windows were painted, the inside was decorated, and they even had a fake Santa Claus. This just seemed out of character for a chain.  The staff working were also fantastic. The two guys working behind the counter were courteous, quick, and funny. They treated us, and all other customers that came in after us like we were the only ones in the store.   I love me some Port of Subs, so I'd come here even if the workers weren't chipper, but it was nice to see.   Also, since some of the Port of Subs locations don't participate in the loyalty card, it is good to know that this one both takes the card and stamps the cards."}
{"text":"I love the Port of Subs. I fell in love after tasting their smoky cheddar. The cheese is so creamy, a bit sharp and full of flavor. I didn't eat here much before I was a vegetarian, but have been rocking the veggie subs here since that time.  This location is one of the 2 locations nearest my home. This location is typically clean, but occasionally there are some sketch characters hanging around this location. Maybe its because there is a Wal-Mart next store...and I've seen my fair share of  the People of Wal-Mart website to know they usually have sketch characters shopping there :-P.  Back to the unfortunately acronym-ed POS...I really enjoy the woman who seems to always be working here (maybe she is the owner??). She is super friendly and does not skip on the veggies. When I order a veggie sandwich, I would assume sandwich shops wouldn't skimp on the veggies, well some do, but not this one. My favorite part of any POS sandwich is the cheese. They have really good cheese. My fave is the smoky cheddar (as previously mentioned, but it  really does deserve another shout out), a close second is the provolone. The cheese here is no exception. Each and every delicious slice is laid out upon the fresh bread to make a little piece of heaven that will soon be enjoyed by my taste buds. Ok, now I am hungry.   I only have 2 concerns with this Port of Subs.  1) They close super early (7pm or 8pm depending on if they've had a dinner rush) 2) They do not accept the Port of Subs loyalty card. Ugh! That is no fun at all."}
{"text":"I could not be more impressed with the customer service at this little sandwich shop. I went in today and ordered three sandwiches for my kids and accidentally I forgot to order one plain (no mayo or mustard) I went back to the store,  I was planning on purchasing just the bread. The gentleman behind the counter said \"absolutely not I'm going to make you a whole new sandwich exactly the way your daughter wanted it\"... That says a lot to me!! Thank you for making my Saturday it's much appreciated Thank you RON!"}
{"text":"Now this place is great.  Forget subway, maan these sandwiches r very good n they cut the meat in front of u so u don't see it sitting around.  A must try indefinite."}
{"text":"This place is gross. Bland tasteless meat, mushy vegetables, plain bread. There's too many other sub shops to come back."}
{"text":"I LOVE  Me some Port of subs. This is the best location I've ever been to by far. The owner Damon is so friendly always has a smile and is always greeting people as well as Pedro who is also so awesome. My only gripe is that the blond haired guy with the bird tattoo (he doesn't have a name tag) looks like he hates his life. He doesn't smile or greet you. He mumbles while taking your order and does not make any eye contact. He's sloppy when he makes sandwiches. I watched him scoop up mayo/mustard off the counter and wipe it on my sandwich. I love this location but I don't  think I'll eat here again if he's  making my sandwich next time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap fast spot for lunch this is a great stop for you... I have ordered the following. No. 7 Roast Beef & Provolone Cheese No. 13 Peppered Pastrami, Turkey & Swiss Cheese No. 3 Salami, Turkey & Provolone Cheese No. 1 Ham, Salami, Capicolla, Pepperoni & Provolone Cheese All of them were pretty good I will be back sometime when I want a cheap sub."}
{"text":"Have been to this location a couple times now and I have to say it has been nice to have a good sandwich place to stop when you need a quick dinner during the week.   The nice Asian lady always smiles at me and is very attentive. The ingredients are fresh and tasty and made quickly."}
{"text":"Food is good but thy are rushy and kinda rude. I mean I know they want to be fast but take your time and actually treat the customer nice"}
{"text":"I ordered Port of Subs through the Foodsby company for delivery to my office. This was my first time ordering from them and I am impressed. The bread is perfectly cooked and fresh. The turkey was sliced perfect. It was just the right amount of mayo, lettuce and cucumber. The small size is perfect for lunch. I am very satisfied with my sub and will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Came to this location a couple days ago with a friend and we were in the area. I get a wrap instead of the bread and I ask for extra cheese and their mayo sauce, well first off rip off on being charged for extra cheese when I don't even get it, it's one very thin slice of cheese. Then when I asked for extra mayo sauce he got annoyed, and their produce didn't look fresh. He barely put any lettuce in it. My wrap looked and tasted very bad. The only nice person was the girl at the register. Never going to this location again. Thank goodness it's not the one by my house."}
{"text":"The gentlemen working was very friendly. I inquired about the veggie subs to which he asked, \"Are you a vegetarian?\". As soon as I said yes, he immediately began cleaning the slicer....with spray and all. Also, my friend was drinking a bottle of soda which had been in car all day. He must of noticed, so he brought her a cup of ice."}
{"text":"Can we start with the smell as you walk through the door of this location?  It was unappealing.  It has been quite some time since I have been to this location.  I would think again before returning.  I ordered a salad.  The staff seemed pleasant, however, when asking me if I wanted the iceberg lettuce, the staff member just pointed to the lettuce...  didn't even ask me verbally.  She forgot to ask me if I wanted cucumber (like she did with the other ingredients) so I had to ask for her to add it.  Once my salad was complete, I asked for the fat free ranch dressing on the side.  They were out!  They weren't even able to offer me another dressing besides oil and vinegar.  I will look at other options before returning here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and people!  I never have a bad experience here! The food is SO good and the staff loves a good conversation. They take their time with each customer and really provide wonderful service. I always leave in a good mood and with delicious food in-hand.   I've never been during their lunch hour, so I don't know how busy it can get, but I do know that when I go in the evenings, it's amazing service, every time. Start up a conversation with the staff and you'll be sure to have a great time!"}
{"text":"I am going to give this place a better rating because they made me a sandwich filled with meat and a smoothie for 12.50. I was starving and a their smaller size sub hit the spot. I went to this place with 12 people from a conference at the Marriott and they had all our food ready and smoothies in no time . great service great taste"}
{"text":"I normally don't post on Yelp but feel the need to show the corners being cut. If it's not corners being cut then there is a gross amount of overcharging occurring for what you actually get. I got a large #13. It's supposed to have pastrami and turkey on it. The slicing of the turkey and pastrami was so thin that even added together it was maybe a quarter of an inch thick. I enjoyed coming here before but it a disappointment to pay 8.50+ for a bread sandwich."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and ordered #13 and it tasted great.  Kaleb started the sandwich and Teresa finished.  Both we're on top of it. This was a step up from my last visit.    Came in today and ordered a 12 inch hot pastrami with all the fixing. Josh was the delicatessen on duty. Added the cucumbers, jalepenos, salt and pepper, olivie oil and vinegar, and pepper jack. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This location is great. Jamie is one of the employees and she's great. The sandwiches are always fresh neat and delicious."}
{"text":"It's not often I find myself schlepping around the campus of ASU. Is this a chain?  I'm not sure.  I've never heard of the place.  Anywho, I found myself here to grab a quick sammich before football festivities.  I was pleasantly surprised.    To me this is a mix between Jimmy John's and Subway.  Jimmy John's (which, btw, was started at my alma mater) has the BEST bread and far surpasses Subway. The bread here isn't JJ's , but it's soft and light.  Yum.  I opted for the tuna.  Now, I was shocked that it was just tuna.  Not tuna salad, but dry tuna.  It was fine, but not anything to get excited over.  The ingredients were fresh, but not as many offerings as Subway.   The prices are comparable to the other subway places, the sandwich was fresh and the service ws A okay.  They also offer wraps and lettuce wrapped sandwiches if you're afraid of carbs."}
{"text":"I work nearby and come here multiple times a week for lunch. I love the freshly-sliced meat and my sandwich is ALWAYS tasty (I get turkey or ham with provolone on wheat).  All of the employees there know me by now and are ALWAYS friendly, fun, and helpful. Couldn't say enough good things about them!  May not be gourmet but it's fast and easy, close-by, healthier than all the surrounding fast food, and a nice environment. I will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I really like Port of Subs. Fresh baked bread (white & wheat) and deli sliced meats with fresh veggies make this place a winner. I prefer a medium #2 on white (ham, turkey & provolone) with most of the fixings. The restaurant is clean and bright- they serve Coke products and offer deli salads (potato and macaroni) if you're tired of chips. You can also grab a fresh made cookie if you have a sweet tooth. The prices are average - expect to spend $8 for a medium 7\" sandwich with side and a drink. The staff at this location is friendly and quick. You can expect longer lunch lines as their are plenty of businesses nearby- and they flock to PoS for the great food and speedy service! See you there!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the lack luster reviews. I've visited this location a few times now and have always had a positive experience. The restaurant is clean, the staff is very friendly and the food is fresh. They slice your meats as you order and have plenty of traditional toppings to flavor your sandwich. I'm particularly fond of the #2 (ham + turkey + provolone). They have a kids meal option with small sandwich, chips, drink and cookie for $4, a pretty good deal. One odd detail I noticed on my most recent visit- the store was playing Skrillex dubstep music, and it seemed odd because families were inside eating their sandwiches. Watching grandma nibble on her tuna sandwich while Skrillex plays in the background is a strange experience.  But yeah, head over to this Port of Subs- great food sliced fresh, with good side options (macaroni salad, yes please) and Coke products."}
{"text":"Everyone working here is super nice and accommodating. One of the employees, Mike, even came up to our table and asked if we wanted our cookies heated up... which was super delicious. Yummy food and great service."}
{"text":"My first time at Port of Subs in YEARS (probably because I'm not a huge sandwich person) but I had a craving today and boy, did it hit the spot!! I ordered a classic medium sub. The meat, bread, and cheese all fresh and tasty. I love the fact that on days that I'm not so famished I can opt for a 5 inch small, in lieu of its bigger 8 inch sandwich. They have added a few new things to the menu so I will be back to try a griller or a wrap. Sandra, the manager was very nice and greeted me when I walked in. My iced tea was great too! Fresh; not stale. As far as franchise sandwich shops go; this one is great one! I will be back. Thank you for a great lunch today."}
{"text":"Can I say this place is incredible for lunch? Because it is! They are so fast and super tasty. I love this location."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The manager is very rude and repeatedly told me my order didn't matter and had to wait because it was placed as a pickup through grubhub. I then got in line to just place the order in person since he wasn't going to start the grubhub order and when it became my turn the manager Brian said those orders aren't priority and you are early. I told him  I would just order in person but as a customer it didn't make me feel good to repeatedly hear him saying that my order doesn't matter and isn't priority. He then tells me I'm not the customer. I don't know who is since grubhub didn't pay $50 for them mediocre sandwiches. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service. Good subs made to order.  Classic subs can be modified upon request, although at extra cost. Prices are great when compared to other options that close to the Las Vegas Strip.   It's in the back corner of the mini-mart of the Shell station on the corner of Koval and Flamingo.  It's within walking distance for me and is open until 2am which makes it an ideal stop for food as I'm walking home from the strip.  Small area that is always clean."}
{"text":"Definitely a few steps above Subway, but still one step below firehouse. They cut all their deli meet on the spot when you order which is awesome. Wish they had more options for toppings on the sandwich, but what they do have is enough."}
{"text":"Wife just left establishment and said she experienced a very unfriendly crew.  Time...7 pm.  There should be zero tolerance."}
{"text":"Ordered the new sourdough bread and it's awful. stale and crunchy. very upset because port of subs is my favorite sandwich shop but I don't know if I'll go back because of how disgusting the bread is. on top of it, the lettuce is old and soggy. I've never had a more awful meal from port of subs. Not sure if it was the location and it's lack of fresh ingredients or what, but I won't be going back to that location or to any in general."}
{"text":"Best. subs. ever. Didn't receive 5 stars because their hours are terrible! Only open until 8 and 6:30 whenever school isn't in session is ridiculous. There are more than just students living in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Just got a really good 12inch with pastrami, turkey, and provologne. Sandwich was perfect and customer service was great. Friendly workers today at 750pm."}
{"text":"Overall Port of Subs is a fantastic chain of sandwich shops, however, not all of the locations match the quality and consistency of the Stephanie and Sunset location. Quality and consistency is probably the biggest challenge for the corporation of Port of Subs because all their locations are franchised out. After trying to weather the ups and downs of my nearest Port of Subs, (location will remain unnamed) I decided to give this one a try. Let me tell you, this location is always a pleasant experience and I believe it all comes down to the franchise owner, Damon. He is always polite and is striving to make the customer happy. His attitude clearly sets the tone for how all of his employees conduct themselves. Aside from the friendly / clean environment, the ingredients are always fresh, and the bread is always soft. I visit this location 4+ times a week and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone (even if you have to travel a few extra miles)!"}
{"text":"my sister and swear by this place....while i may be the only one who really likes subway, there is something very unique about port of subs.  it tastes fresher for some reason.   Thats probably becyase they slice the meat when you oder, and its not pre portioned like at some other places. The bread doesn't have any flavors like subway does, however, the generous portions of meat make up for that.  Bread only comes in white or wheat.     its located in the albertsons shopping center..you cant miss it, and if you do, look again..  place - clean service - nothing above ordinary food - great"}
{"text":"The employees here always give TOP NOTCH customer service. They are always so sweet and accommodating!! I've been here several times and each employee has always been great! My favorite port of subs location BY FAR. :)"}
{"text":"New location is finally open!  Bright & clean interior with friendly & fast service!  Love the bread!"}
{"text":"This location is too expensive.  It also refused to provide free tap even with purchase.  I find this unacceptable as I have never faced this issue anyway else in the US.  As this is unacceptable, I can not rate it more than one star."}
{"text":"This Port of Subs is super close to my work and has become a go-to for a quick meal for myself and my co-workers. Usually we take turns running out to get orders for each other around 11:30 AM.  Being that this place is in a very busy location next to quite a few business park ares the staff is super efficient. While sometimes brusque, it's OK because there's usually a line all the way out to almost the doorway on weekdays during lunch.  I like Port of Subs for the freshly cut cheeses and meats. I also think their bread always seems fresher than Subways.  Honestly, for a quick lunch bite that everyone can agree on among my work circle Port of Subs is the place."}
{"text":"So happy to find a PoS near my work. I have been driving by this place for months not realizing it was RIGHT THERE. When I get out of work at 8:30 PM there are not a lot of places to go. Usually fast food is the only option for a non-costly meal. Now I have Port of Subs! This one is located in the Lowes shopping center on Eastern in close proximity to the new terminal (T3) of McCarran International.  I arrived at exactly 8:40 PM last night just praying they weren't closed. They weren't! Although they were cleaning up. I felt kind of bad, as I usually do, when entering an establishment that close to when they are closing, but I really wanted a sandwich! The two male employees inside did not seem bothered by me arriving so late. They were talkative and nice while they made my sandwich.   I love all of PoS sandwiches, but I usually get the #5 (Turkey, Ham, and Cheddar Cheese). There's one thing I love about PoS over Subway - they actually have SLICED cheddar cheese! At Subway you can only get it shredded. :/  My sandwich was delicious and I got a combo (about $8). It's kind of pricey, but that's just about how much you'll pay for a combo anywhere these days.   The store was clean, the employees nice, and my food was great. A+!"}
{"text":"This Port of Subs is located in a very busy shopping center surrounded by corporate buildings and businesses. So beware about going during rush times 11 AM - 1 PM. I happened upon this place because it is close to the yoga studio I am currently going to. It's definitely WAAAY on the other side of town from me - but boy was I glad to find one so close to the studio! It makes for quick meal before or after my yoga class.  The staff is nice and they're quick. I love POS sandwiches and I rarely happen upon a poorly made sandwich. It has not happened to me here yet.   Word of caution - the parking lot is small and the place itself is quite small. So if you do want to eat in it would be best to go AFTER the lunch and dinner rush."}
{"text":"This Port of Subs is located in a desolate shopping center. The only thing in this place attracting any attention is the pitiful Target that happens to be the only \"big-box\" store left in the area.  Establishment was clean, sandwich-makers were there, and came out to make my sandwich when I entered. All pluses.   I ordered my usual - cheddar, ham, turkey on wheat. Made it a combo. It was a good POS sandwich.  Will probably become a go-to for my lunch breaks."}
{"text":"Been here twice, not impressed.  Port of Subs is actually a very good sub shop. I've been to other locations in other cities, and other locations in Vegas I've been pleased.  I've been here twice and both times have been lacking. Last time I went they were out of wheat bread so I opted for sourdough. The sourdough was dry, dry, dry and like a brick. My husband ordered their \"Pilgrim\" sandwich, he only ate half. It's a play on Thanksgiving (turkey, cranberry, stuffing, and then grilled). He said it can't hold a candle to the Bobbie from Capriotti's.  Also, service is slow. I think this is because they have a drive-thru which typically always has someone in it. With the lack of workers this leaves the few employees they have to work a drive-thru and make sandwiches for the people coming inside.  Quality isn't bad - it's same as other POS I've been to. Location is small. Service is OK, but slow.  If it weren't so close to my house I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Sammiches, sammiches... I love 'em. They're so quintessential to American everyday life so I love having a lot of options of sandwich places where I live.   Port of Subs has been a favorite of mine since college. My first big time crush/love worked at Port of Subs for many years so it was always good for me to go out of my way to get my sandwiches at POS.  This one is okay. As it is the closest to my house it is the one I go to normally. The staff here is really young, gotta be high school students. Not that that's a bad thing, but sometimes when I walk in here I get the vibe that says: \"WHAT are you doing here? WE don't want to actually work!\" Yah. And then you gotta order your sandwich from an angry little teenager and watch them to make sure it gets made how you want it. Which is not a problem because you do get to watch them make it - I love that. Especially since you can just easily ask \"Hey can I get a few more pickles?\"   I like their mayo/mustard combo and the fact that they slice the meat right there before putting it on your sandwich. Usually I get a #5 (turkey, ham, smoked cheddar), but yesterday I got the #3 (turkey, salami, cheddar). Typically I don't go for the salami-type meats, but it turned out pretty good! The reason I ended up getting that sandwich was because I said \"I want a number 3, er I meant 5\", but apparently the lady did not hear my correction. Oh well, her mistake kind of made my day, because I got to try a new sandwich and I liked it! However, still kind of bad that she wasn't listening to me enough to hear me correct myself.  Oh well, all in all I like POS. If you go here often make sure to get their stamp card so you can eventually get a free sandwich!"}
{"text":"Always a great sub from here! The staff is friendly & efficient. I've also ordered large catering orders in the past & they always make sure we have plenty of sides!"}
{"text":"Clean and friendly. It's exactly what I expected! Here alot. I work close by. You can call ahead so its ready, too. Go have a number 7!"}
{"text":"I planned on getting a cheesesteak around the corner but it was 20 minutes before they opened, so i came here. Ordered a large turkey and salami on sourdough. Very little meat on the sandwich. Paid an extra $2 for bacon straight out of the microwave. Everything was sliced fresh, except the lettuce looked a little brown. I didn't enjoy the food, especially for the price. Had better subs in a school cafeteria. The only two things I tasted were vinegar and pepper."}
{"text":"I had heard such great things about Port of Subs from my co-workers so I decided to check it out.  I like that the meats are sliced fresh.  I think the bread tasted like packaged bread you would buy at the store.  I do like the options of potato or macaroni salad instead of chips.  And I do like that they have 20 oz drinks, not just fountain.  For the price and size, I think Jersey Mike's is way better."}
{"text":"In high school port of subs was available at our cafeteria so I think that is why I like it so much. They definitely have some pros over subway if you want fast food style subs. The bread is better,you get more meat, and I prefer the veggies as well. The owner would come to our school a lot and he was really nice and caring. I went to this location one time for lunch, and it was a bit chaotic during the rush, but still worth the wait compared to subway!   I haven't tried any smoothies yet, but I've heard they are good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely DISAPPOINTED!!!  WILL NEVER MAKE AN ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION!!  The owners @ this location; not prepared to run a business for sure!   I requested an order (2 variety sandwich trays) a week in advance for my daughters birthday.  The day of the pick up the owners (not the employees) figured they didn't stock up on necessary products (meats) and the girls/employees didn't have enough ingredients to finish the order (they had 1 week advance notification) and now we were left missing the whole orders of roast beef and pastrami sandwiches.  The young lady was so apologetic about the situation and poor girl was constantly trying to get ahold of the owner to make sure he was on the way with the meats but guess what he was way too busy with his personal errands (not caring about the business).  He told his employee to let us know it'll be an additional 30min wait besides the 45 min we had already waited because he needed to finish up his errands. ( OH NO! Mad at this point) The young lady asked if it was ok to make the rest of the order with different ingredients...we had no choice but to keep it basic due to the time crunch plus our cake was gonna go down the drain if we didn't refrigerate it on time.  Total chaos was caused by an irresponsible business owner!  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming a go-to lunch place. It's right around the corner from my job, and guaranteed to be delicious. They cater to the busy working lunch crowd, given the proximity to SRP and all the other businesses nearby. Despite the constant traffic of hungry professionals, the line always moves quickly and the people working here are pretty nice and/or funny.   Try a wrap and get it grilled/pressed like a burrito. So good! And the cookies are to DIE FOR!! I find myself wanting to run by just to get a soft white chocolate macadamia cookie all the time. But then I end up getting a sub too... and maybe another cookie for the road... this is why I can't be thin.  I'll be here again soon! COOKIES"}
{"text":"I order a sandwich with only 3 things on it.  Teriyaki chicken, bacon and cheese..  it was messed up twice..  the sandwich costs $12.  The first time around they put buffalo sauce on it instead of teriyaki. 2nd time they forget to put bacon on the sandwhich..   So now I'm sitting here with teriyaki sauce all over my clothes trying to put extremely hot bacon on my sandwich. Just a bad experience"}
{"text":"As other yelpers have mentioned, the owner is a sweetheart. However, they do not honor coupons and more often than not they close 30 min - 1 hour earlier than what the sign on the door states. Kind of annoying to drive over and find that they're closed at 6.  But when they are open, it's a great location."}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches!! We put in a catering order for our office, and it was really top notch!! Professional, on time, but seriously... good sandwiches!! This was one of the best sandwiches I have had. Veggie was packed with everything.. Yum, and gotta try their salads! They made us a buffalo chicken salad with the works that was really really great! I don't even think it is a regular menu item, ask for it though, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place and maybe I am over hyping it but the mayo/mustard mixture they make is like crack to me.  I need it, I want it, I love it on my number nine!  I get the small peppered pastrami on wheat with no cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion, jalapenos and yes....my crack.  The sandwich was my go-to sandwich when I was losing weight because it only adds up to 360 calories and it filled me up for 3-4hours.  I have stuck to it ever since, so if you like fresh ingredients, tasty tasty ingredients then make your next stop any of the port a sub locations.  I love them all!"}
{"text":"closest location to my home unfortunately but Port of Sub's is the best out of the fast food sub shops.  The inexpedience is everything and you can tell they're fresh.  I love the peppered pastrami and swiss on wheat with crack (mayo mustard mixed), lettuce, tomato, onion, & jalapenos, Oh my!  You cant ever go wrong here with any of the sandwiches.  This location gets super busy at lunch FYI, since it is near the air park."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs but this location seems like their ingredients are not as fresh.  The bread maybe is a little old but I am not for sure.  It stinks because this is my favorite sub sandwich place and when I go to the I-17 & Thunderbird or 19ave & Deer Valley location the sandwich is always great.  I always get the peppered pastrami on wheat with the mayo-mustard mixture (its addictive as crack).  So when I go out of my way to stop here when I am in the area it is a let down and yesterday was no exception.  I hope they improve things here so I can feed my addiction when I need to."}
{"text":"Was a favorite location until today. Went in today with my son and was shocked at the music playing. Every other word was a curse word. They shouldn't play music with lyrics they wouldn't let employees use. Left very disappointed. Not appropriate and will not be able to come back."}
{"text":"This is my go to sandwich spot probably once a week! Always super fast, fresh & friendly. Josh probably whips up my sandwiches the fastest, truly appreciated!"}
{"text":"I've been obsessed with Port of Subs since I was like 8...and I've also ordered the same sandwich since...I was like 8.   There's something about Port of Subs that just makes them taste better than any other sandwich shop, I think there's a secret to that mustard/mayo mix (it's delicious).   When we moved to Centennial, I was totally stoked to find out about this location practically down the street from my house, so you can say I come in a lot. The staff is always really friendly and this is a very clean location. We had a family barbecue this past Monday and I was way too lazy to make my own potato salad, so I called this place the day prior and for a 3lb? order that feeds up to 10 people it was only $10! And of course it was delicious."}
{"text":"New management at Port of Subs!!  Since Rome came to work here the quality and customer service has grown.  Sandwiches are delicious and I love the \"service with a smile.\""}
{"text":"This location rekindled my love for Port of Subs. Mike Carol and Anne all helped me out and I couldn't stop thanking them for their friendly customer service. Amazing food and amazing service. Good on them"}
{"text":"Just great lunch deal...$5 sub of the day.    Always fast and fresh.  Great place to just relax and have lunch."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good, inexpensive and the workers are friendly and quick. The bread and meat is so much better than Subway. There isn't an array of toppings like bell pepper and spinach though, but they do have a variety of melts and hot sandwiches that look enticing.   The setting is cramp and needs a minor soap and scrub. There's no bathroom to wash your hands and sometimes the tea and ice machine doesn't work. But all the workers, during my usual lunch hour (11:30-12:30), are personable and super friendly. And it's nice to see a good camaraderie between them. They also play 107.5 instead of that shitty, family friendly, soft rock. So thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"All of the employees I've encountered are all very nice. They're quick with my order and never get impatient waiting for me to decide what five family members want on their sandwiches. The food tastes fresh & looks fresh. I like them better than Subway... Their place also smells fresh, unlike Subway. If you're looking for a quick bite this is the place for fresh , fast & friendly service."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the place reeked of bleach. Really strong. And as I was eating they came around again with a bleach bucket washing floors right where we were all sitting. Couldn't finish my sandwich. I appreciate that they are trying to keep the place clean but it's just too strong and they did it during dinner. I feel they should do it during down times. After I decided it was just too smelly to eat, I wanted used the bathroom before getting back on the road. The toilet seat was broken in half and not usable and it smelled of bleach even stronger in there. I absolutely love their sandwiches and the staff were polite and friendly but the bleach and broken toilet seat makes it likely that I won't return."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this chain And used to be a big fan of this location unfortunately last time I was in here the gentleman working the counter was very upset and I saw him after yelling with his co-worker handle cash with the plastic gloves on and then go on to make a sandwich without changing his gloves I find it unacceptable do not have a fresh pair of gloves on every time you touch anything other than the food."}
{"text":"Great service and not too crowded. Maybe it's because I stop by later in the evening. The workers are pretty cool and never had a bad experience at this location. A+"}
{"text":"Same sandwich, different wrapper.  Subway, Quiznos, Port of Subs, whatever, they are all the same"}
{"text":"I LOVE these sandwiches! OMG they are delicious. Customer service is always good. I didn't even know they were there....otherwise I would have gone a lot sooner!"}
{"text":"This location has recently opened and I am excited to have one closer to me in Surprise! Our first visit was a few days after they opened and as expected, there is a learning curve so it was a little slow going, but at least my sub was correct and tasty! Our second visit was about a week ago and it was a little quicker and the bread was a bit fluffier (as I'm used to at other locations) and the subs were just as delicious. They have a great kid's meal special too! I love that they offer some toppings, like cucumbers, that other local sub places don't.  Cost wise, it's pretty on par with competitors but I feel that the portion size is perfect. Hoping that things keep improving as everyone gets trained up. We are proud to support a Veteran-owned business and will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I have never been here before and gotta be honest not really a fan of a lot of the sub chains. Now this one I liked probably because I love sourdough bread, they slice everything fresh in front of you which is unique, the place was clean, customer service was ok... nothing really stood out but that bread that I loved. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"First visit here. Not impressed. $9 combo meal, but my sandwich is mostly bread and the meat was so skimpy. I got the salami/turkey/provolone with lots of veggie toppings/mayo/salt/oil/vinegar...honestly, all I taste is bread.   Won't be returning."}
{"text":"One of my frequent stops when I want a sub. I like how they slice the meat and cheese fresh to order. I usually order the turkey and pastrami when I go here. They make pretty good subs, as far as sub shops go.  The staff is very friendly at this location. They also have an iPhone app to order ahead of time so you won't have to wait in line to order.  I would recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"This store has the best service and staff, love the sandwiches and the restaurant is very clean. Hardly any wait time in the line.  I would recommend this shop to everyone"}
{"text":"Best Port of Subs in Las Vegas hands down Mike( Owner) and his staff are super welcoming and customer service is on point Last but definitely not least all his food is super fresh and sandwiches taste amazing  I could probably go on and on but if you want a fresh Sub go to this location I promise you won't regret it!! Thank you Mike and staff you guys are awesome"}
{"text":"Love coming here before class. Great quick service with a happy staff. Be sure to try their bacon, extra crispy! One of my favorite extras for my sandwich as well as chipotle sauce!"}
{"text":"I enjoy port of subs whenever I can but they aren't always great with large orders. They made multiple mistakes when we ordered online this last time. The food is good but they need to read more carefully the orders."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!  I want to thank the team at the North Durango location, for their attention to detail and for making our order a priority!  Initially I ordered 70 sandwiches for Saturday morning and with just one day to go, I added 30 more sandwiches to the order, they never skipped a beat.  Everything arrived exactly as I ordered it and all of my managers loved the fresh sandwiches, cookies and the mayo-mustard mix.  We will definitely be using this store for future events.  Thanks to Mike and his team for helping to make our event successful."}
{"text":"Stopped to pick up a dub for my son on my way home from work. I tend to prefer Port of Subs quality over Subway. Didn't have a nametag but very friendly sandwich maker. Only negative I'd say was that a foot long turkey with bacon was almost $12."}
{"text":"Port of Subs is the same as most other sandwich shops - except how do they get pickles so thin? Seriously - they are thin and translucent. The staff is fairly skimpy with the toppings and my sandwich maker today was not proficient with the avocado scooper. The scooper is very small. He put one scoop that was about the size of a quarter on the sandwich. He attempted a second scoop, which he had to scrape around the bucket, and then fumbled the exchange as he tried to put it on the sandwich. As both dabs of avocado hit the table, he reached for the spatula. The spatula was not much better as he dropped it, and attempted to schmear the little avocado on the bread. As much remained on the handle as was on the bread. Maybe he's new? Or maybe they are just skimpy on toppings and have an inefficient staff?"}
{"text":"Not good service. Employees are disorganized and not proactive. I was waiting to pay and there was a man at the register and he was on his cell phone. On the other hand... The lady who made my smoothie was very welcoming and proactive so I thank her for the good service."}
{"text":"I enjoy port of subs quite often. I travel around Las Vegas for work and tend to not have a standard location. 99% of the time I have a great experience. This location however has the rudest manager I've ever dealt with. She was very snappy with customers when she asked for toppings on the sandwiches. Luckily I've had other good experiences with port of subs but if this was my first experience, I would never dine here again. This was the blonde lady who I belive is the manager or owner of this location. Every other employee at this location was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Located near Gate D 03 the sub I ordered was very overpriced. It cost $18 for a tuna sub with a drink and chips.  The tuna tasted as if it was still frozen including the pickle.  Yuck yuck yuck.  Should've went to the bagel place just past Cinabon if walking towards gate 36."}
{"text":"My girls loves Port of Subs and want to eat here all the time.  I have three favorite locations and one that we call \"the stingy Port of Subs\" - this locations is one of our favorites - clean, not too busy, fairly efficient employees - it is Port of Subs, so the food is the same everywhere, but we like locations that are clean and pleasant - this is one of those locations."}
{"text":"My kids love Port of Subs, and as a sandwich shop, I love it too - especially for me since they started with the lettuce wraps.  Still, regardless of how much you like the general product, this location deserves 5 stars just based on the owner and his staff.    The owner is often there.  He has trained his staff to be AMAZING.  That is all I really need to say.  We often drive to this location, even though it is further than another local Port of Subs because of the service.  So, stop there because you are in the area and want a sandwich.  But, also stop there because you want a sandwich and you know excellent service is waiting for you here."}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious subs! The prices are a little high though, but they do have a punch card and if you buy 10 (I think) subs, you get 1 free. It definitely won't take me long to fill up the card!"}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for this place, and I guess I'm the last Las Vegan on earth to try the food here. I was working right next door, and I noticed that they had a steady flow of customers. Since I had never been here before, I took a little bit of time to make my menu selection. Tis' the season for turkey and stuffing, and this place had a seasonal sandwich to commemorate the venerable Thanksgiving meal. My sandwich \"artist\"  (Tom or Dan?) and the other employees really didn't seem all that enthused about their job. Thank goodness the lady behind me in line was my sandwich advocate, and she instructed him on how to make the sandwich correctly because he wasn't well-versed in the ingredients for each sandwich.  The turkey was processed lunch meat, and the amount of stuffing was pretty pathetic, so I requested a bit more. They were happy to oblige, but they placed it in the microwave to warm it up, and the stuffing ended up tasting like rubber. Seriously, I cringed a bit at the frequent use of the microwave. Ick!  I also purchased a chicken Caesar wrap, which did a fine job at underwhelming my palate as wel (thank goodness the lady behind me reminded Tom/Dan to put the romaine  lettuce and not the shredded iceberg he was planning on putting on my Caesar).  Their fresh veggies were quite limited, and to be honest with you, quite sad. I love a \"sala-wich,\" and I always ask Subway to \"run it through the garden when it comes to the veggies. Okay, so this isn't Subway, but it's a'ight. I'm not sure that I will come back though, because their prices are a lot higher than the $5 footlongs I've come to adore from their competitor, and the quality of the ingredients is lacking. Also, Capriotti's makes a better turkey and stuffing sandwich (the Bobbie), and theirs is year-round.  The staff was pleasant enough, and they were all quite prompt, but all 5 star ratings seem a little baffling to me. Meh!"}
{"text":"their subs are just ok.. i feel like I have to add to many things in order to have some flavor...  I went to this particular location and it was kind of dirty. the only good thing is that they always send coupons on the mail for free subs... but even then I would recommend for you to go to one of their competitor."}
{"text":"Sliced by hand meats start your order with fresh white, wheat, or sourdough bread. A plentiful selection of vegetables, sauces and seasonings. Good pricing, comparable size to most, but has stand out fresh taste for a truly affordable price!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Port of Subs!!!! Don't get me wrong, Subway is my baby! However, the sandwiches and service at this store are out of this world!!!! Shout out to David for being a great employee ! The owner of this store is great as well!"}
{"text":"Love this store!!!! Delicious sandwiches every time and very friendly staff!!!!! I've been to this location for my birthday several times! Never a disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"Although I've never had a bad experience at any Port Of Subs this is my favorite location. This location is always clean, the food is always fresh, especially the bread:)!!! What I like most about this location is the staff, the staff here are able to take your order, make your sandwich and have a friendly conversation with a  very good timing . Love this location"}
{"text":"Visited Friday 03/23 for lunch on our way to second shift employment. Hubby got giant #1.  I got medium hot pastrami.  Freshly sliced meats and cheeses.  More unique variety of bagged chip selections.  Fresh sodas.  Overall pretty delicious"}
{"text":"I am addicted to these subs! Great ingredients, tasty fresh bread and the mayo/ mustard mix is the bomb! Meats and cheeses are sliced in front of you, just like at a deli.   I have also ordered one of their party subs and it was just as good as when you eat in. Can't go wrong with this place.  Anyway, if your looking for a good sandwich this place is quick and will hit the spot every time!"}
{"text":"First time here...definitely will be the last.  Placed an order online for pickup at 3pm.  Arrived at 305pm.  We were then told they couldn't find our order.  Provided the email from Port of Subs.  Two workers started making our order while the guy took our order number to look it up.  He eventually comes back and says we have to pay again even though we already paid online.  Even showed the charge on our bank account.  Long story short Port of Subs has stolen money from me but claims they will be refunding us even though they can't find the order number.  Shady business here!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here everything from the food to the customer service was amazing. So today I went back expecting the same thing- the two men that were working last time were also working today and they are so nice which is why I'm even giving this place 1 star.  I got home and ate my food - not even an hour later I'm in so much pain and violently sick in the bathroom.  I will never come here again.  I haven't eaten anything since my regular breakfast so I know the food here is what made me so sick.  Very disappointed and I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"We ordered trays for a party online. Within 30 seconds I received a phone call confirming my order and they also were nice enough to let me know that I ordered items that already came with my sandwiches. They were personal, professional, and respectful. I would order from them anytime! Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"2 stars. I'd give 0, but my sandwich wasn't terrible. So 2 stars for my food being good. 3 for below average service.  Unfortunately, it's close and one of my boyfriend's favorite fast food places so I may end up eating here again, but not by my choice.   Anyways, all the sandwich makers had scowls on their faces, shit attitudes.   I ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich and my sandwich maker forgot the avocado (the reason I even got the sandwich), so I told her to just add that on and we'd be good. She scooped it up and put it on the edge of the sandwich and put the bread on... didn't spread it or anything.   Since she was already in a shit mood I just decided to take it home and I'd spread it myself.  When I got home the avocado was all over the place, but not in my sandwich and the damn thing wasn't even cut all the way through...  Messing up my food is a sure fire way to piss me off. I had half a mind to just throw my sandwich at them and make them redo it and do it correctly.   It's not difficult to make a damn sandwich. Next time I'll suggest just letting me go back there and making my own (if I am ever forced to go back).   I'd suggest Jimmy Johns or Silver Mine in Tempe. Much better service and food."}
{"text":"I was hoping for something more than an ordinary sub shop and I found it. I had the best veggie sub, they slice the meats and even the cheese right when you order it. Everything tasted so fresh and the bun was just right. The staff was super friendly and they seemed like they enjoyed their job. Thank you for a pleasant experience. Only 4 stars because after all you are still a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick lunch. I forgot to get the name of the guy who helped me. He was wearing a Zelda hat. Anyways. I just wanted to give him credit because he was very personable and quick when it came to making my sandwich. Hopefully someone in management reads this and gives credit where due."}
{"text":"This is normally one of my favorite lunch places. Today I come in and there is a kid playing behind the counter bouncing a ball which I believe to be Not sanitary. I believe it's the owners and the wife was very dry. Didn't greet and wasn't listening to what I wanted on my sandwich. The employees that normally work are really good and quick. Today they get a 1 star."}
{"text":"My and my son come here every Thursday after his therapy. He looks forward to coming here every week:) The staff know us and already know our order on Sub combo and one soup. I I love how they say hi and always say \"Goodbye see you guys next week\" it really makes our day:) love the staff and the subs with fresh meat slices is delicious and fresh!!!"}
{"text":"For a Port of Subs, this location is pretty good. It has a lot of seating and it is clean. I've never been in and seen a long line. Having two stations for sandwich making helps. They have couches to sit and big screen TVs. Doesn't sound like a typical Port of Subs huh? And that's why I'm taking the time to review this spot."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch and had a very pleasant experience. Upon walking in, this place seemed like an average joe sammy shop, comparable to a subway. But no, they slice their meats to order and it was very good. They have great meat, competitive prices, and good service."}
{"text":"First, I have to say I will go out of my way to go to this location. The staff are on point, as soon as you walk in the door. I pick up food here often during my lunch break for work. I will order online, and upon walking in the door, my sandwiches are made and waiting. They are made exactly to the order details. The food quality here is great, though all Port of Subs, do use better quality food. I will come back here often!"}
{"text":"This food here is good. They always make my sandwich the way that I order it and the prodcuts are always fresh. I think I'm giving it low stars because of the area. Scary people around here..."}
{"text":"Good service and very clean store. Was greeted right away and ordered The Vegetarian sandwich. The cheeses were sliced fresh to order and the workers were quick. The store is in a busy Smith's parking lot so be careful when turning corners. I would come back to this location though."}
{"text":"Decided to do catering with Port of Subs for an office meeting and so glad I did! I went with the platter that was all subs. It was a six foot sub sandwich and I could pick 3 types of sandwiches out of their 18 varieties. I picked the ham, the turkey, and the salami/ham subs. They put the pickles, jalapenos, olives, and banana peppers on the side so the subs wouldn't get soggy. Nice touch! Mayo and mustard was also on the side. Everyone was so helpful putting this platter together and even helped take the goodies to the car! They also took the time to make sure the platter looked good too! The office loved the subs and I will be catering from here for sure. The manager Alfredo also informed me they can deliver catering and that they have a Flamingo Flamingo and Koval location, so that's good to know too. Very helpful staff, great food, and clean store. I now stop by regularly to get my lunches and/or dinner sandwiches here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered a 12\" sub, asked to get it toasted and they put it in panini press. It was so thin I couldve put it in my wallet! Plus the have  a limited variety of veggies. Total $8! worst $8 I ever spent, never going back! I took pics of this crappy sandwich wish I could post them."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good and fresh, but the girl treats her employees like garbage. I've been to Port of Subs several times and noticed this on several accounts. She is very belittling and hostile towards her new employees. It can be heard while you're sitting down eating. It makes for a very unsettling atmosphere. Port of Subs is no longer getting my business."}
{"text":"My first time and my turkey, ham and cheddar sandwich is very very tasty!  I will come here again."}
{"text":"This is the best Port of Subs in Vegas  Had one at my intersection in Summerlin  Then one across from my office in Henderson near Sunset Station I loved it, the gay guy that works there is so nice And funny.   I like that they remember your name and what you order.  The tables are clean Parking is fine  No issues ever.  They have great brownies and cookies,  I always get one huge  #1  Double meat Double cheese Italian sub Lots of vinegar.  One large foot long feeds me and my nanny and child.  But you have to order right I've always given a tip They are cool in there.   Never ever complained   Utilized thier trays of sandwiches for my business and meetings  Have a tray when people come over to go swimming, just call a half hour ahead they are really nice"}
{"text":"My initial impression when walking into this Port of Subs was that it looked and felt dirty.  There was a line of customers waiting to place their orders. The three associates working hurried around trying the best that they could. The counter where they make sandwiches was literally covered in toppings (lettuce, spinach, etc) When it was my turn the associate took his hand and ran it across the counter, wiping everything onto the ground.   I ordered a veggie sandwich. The sandwich itself ended up being decent. Actually it wasn't bad st all.   My biggest concern was one associate who ran back and forth from making sandwiches to the register. Not once did I see her wash her hands. Gloves are not a substitute for hand washing! This associate bounced back and forth, taking payments and making sandwiches a bunch of times."}
{"text":"I went in totally in the mood for a tuna salad sandwich. They said they were out of tuna. Really???  The turkey was delicious though.  A week or so later I went back and ordered . They messed up on three sandwiches putting stuff on the we didn't ordered. Looks like we need to find another ."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The environment is fun and clean ! The crew is super friendly ans helpful. They seem to actually care about their customers ! Ports of subs for the win.!"}
{"text":"No consistency and chances are your order will be incorrect.   8/01/15 Online Pickup Order of 4 subs - They forgot to bag one of my sandwiches - got all the way home before they called me to come back. They forgot to put turkey on Classic Sub #13 which comes standard with pastrami and turkey. Probably the worst part was the lettuce - all core pieces that were browned, disgusting.   6/2015 Online Pickup Order - 3 out of 5 sandwiches were incorrect to some degree...Wrong bread, or cheese or vegetables. I was told the online payment total was short and asked to pay a couple dollars more when I picked up the order.  Veggies were not fresh and they included the end of tomatoes, and fragments of other foods that didn't belong, like onions - yuck.  Even though I took time to type names for each sandwich when ordering online (both times), the employees at this location never write anything to identify the individual subs. Always seems like the employees don't care about quality.  Next time I will drive to another location and AVOID this one by Smiths on N Durango."}
{"text":"The staff is always so sweet and anxious to help. They have a nice cozy atmosphere and the owner is really nice. Either me or someone in my family visits this place weekly and it's our go to port of subs. These guys are great. Great service great food great folks!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered a #1 which clearly comes with Provolone cheese and the girl (Tatiana) proceeded to put American Cheese on both as my husband asked her twice doesn't that come with Provolone cheese? she ignored him and proceeded to talk to the person next to her and continued to put stuff on the sandwiches. She then got in a confrontation with the person next to her slamming stuff down when they said she had put the wrong cheese on the sandwiches. She was very rude and confrontational and did not acknowledge either of us the entire time we were ordering.   Live across the street from this location and come here once or twice a week. Not anymore...."}
{"text":"Franchised by a guy named Brian..... poor customer service, also the guy that worked there name Jonathan I believe totally didn't respect or listen to me, I had to repeat my order about 5 times until he got it right, you have to be kidding me... then tried to agrue with me and say I never said my order and in front of other co workers and my 5 year daughter.. after I left the store and then I actually went to call brian the actual owner and then he proceeded to yell at me saying that I was wrong, and that no one likes me (mind you he said that after him being nice to me and giving me family discounts for years) so this was a total shock to me that he's been thinking of me this whole time and didn't even like me or my family. he's known me since my baby was 2 days old. to make a long story short after I was yelled at on the phone and told that stuff I hung up and I'm never been to that 1 ever again, its on Jones and badura. and he owns another one on rainbow and Russell and I will never give my services to them either."}
{"text":"UPDATE: After leaving this, Taylor from their corporate office reached out to me, was very gracious & gave me a gift certificate to give it another try. My boyfriend & I went back to this location tonight & had a very great experience with Dolaney & the same girl from last time. They were very friendly & made excellent sandwiches. The environment was also welcoming this time around as the chairs weren't stacked on top of the tables.  I've been here 3 times - Every time I've been here it's been around dinner time & the chairs are on the tables,  Giving you the feel that they're about to close even though it's 6 pm.. very uninviting! This last time was tonight, January 17, 2017 at around 6:20. The man on duty, Lucas, was very uninviting. He had a bad attitude & the girl he was working with told him to be more patient, I'm guessing he was training her.. not cool. We were then  rushed out so Lucas could get his next cigarette break. I can't say I'll be returning to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"I really like Port of Subs sandwiches.  I usually get #6-vegetarian.  You have a choice of three cheeses, but I always get triple Provolone. The bread they bake tastes really good and doesn't flake when I eat, unlike another major sandwich chain.  It's not dry either and I don't feel like I need to wash the particles down with a drink.   Port of Subs is right down the street from where I work, which is perfect because they are quick and always have a smile.  Employees are always helpful and help me out when I make a lunch run for the office.  I always ask if I can hand them the post-its of orders and not once have they rolled their eyes.  They take them all, stick them on the counter and begin making the sandwiches.  When they're done, they will mark the wrapper with an initial or something for easy identifying.   I just love coming here. Sandwiches are made tasty by friendly employees.  Plus, coupons arrive in the mail frequently and I can use my student ID at this location to get a small combo for $5.49.  Not bad for a student on a budget!"}
{"text":"Lots of wins for this location. 1) I placed an online order to be ready at 5:15, it was ready early at 5:05! 2) I ordered 4 sandwiches, 3 drinks, and 3 chips, and they were all selected for me by the time I arrived, in contrast with other locations who have just handed me the sandwich with an empty cup and told me to grab my chips; and 3) the staff was concerned about how I'd carry everything and found me a perfect box just for that purpose. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Terrific staff, awesome sandwiches. Omg the fresh made cookies! From the pictures on the wall, the owner seems to do a lot for the community as well."}
{"text":"Port of subs here in Summerlin always a crowd pleaser. It is so nice to call in all the different sandwiches the family wants and have them available for pick up in 10-20 mins. depending on the size of the order. Kristy is always so helpful and friendly in addition to doing a good job on making my sandwiches. The bread to meat and fixings ratio is just perfect for us. The bread is so soft which really makes my husband happy. I opt to have my sandwich turned into a salad to avoid the extra carbs. Thanks Kristy for always making our sammichs so yummy and making my salad just as great as a sandwich :)    Restaurant is always clean and all the fixings are fresh which of course is a plus. If you have any questions or problems, not that I ever have, and I have been going there for years, the manager Ron is super friendly and eager to make it right. Ron always said to me \"if you need anything\" for me to let him know and he almost always thanks us for coming in. Great service!!   I really love this kind of personable service and it makes me feel very trusting of the staff with our food order. That is why my family chooses this place for our lunch, dinner and our superbowl needs (party platter fresh meat and cheese, plus our fruit bowl was so tasty)  If your looking for a good Port of Subs this is your location :)"}
{"text":"Polite and friendly staff. We would love to support this local spot more but they skimp you on your meat every time. I believe the owner or manager tells them not to put meat on the sandwhich or upcharge for \"more meat.\"  See photo, this is our sandwich 9 out of 10 times we have been here."}
{"text":"This was my very first time having this. The employees made it a great experience as I told them it was my first visit and they helped to explain everything from signature sauces to their all time favorites. I felt that I couldn't go wrong making decisions armed with their input! I ordered and everything was prepared fresh. They even sliced the meat right then and there!!!!! It was probably one of the freshest sub sandwiches I have had and I will definitely be going back the next time I crave a great sandwich. Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"I'm not one for speaking badly about anyone who works in the food industry, as I understand the struggles from working in the food industry the past 5 years. I understand that some people have bad days. However, I felt very unwelcomed when I came in tonight with my fiancé to buy subs. The lady working seemed miserable, and just wanted us to leave. After we got our subs, we decided to eat there without realizing that it was almost closing time. After we sat down and started eating she walked over to the door and said \"We're closed, get out\". Not a good first impression at all."}
{"text":"They really need to get the young lady here help Everytime I come here I have to wait 15 minutes I only get a 30 minute lunch so it sucks having to scarf down your food I even called my order in.  she's one person so I cant blame her i blame management for being cheap and not hiring more than one person."}
{"text":"This location stinks. Service is ridiculous. Girl behind the counter kept asking about the tattoos my husband and I have. Rather unprofessional and pretty rude. I'm not a fan of people who try to make small talk with me in the hopes that we have something in common. This location was also dirty. Never again. I will stick with Subway."}
{"text":"Josh and Freddy were fantastic! Super helpful, attentive and personable!!! Will definitely be returning since the other flamingo location the woman are very rude!!! Thanks for making our experience so wonderful!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a sub for lunch, on sourdough bread. The bread was not fresh, almost stale. it was hard to chew. Otherwise the sub (#5) was ok, and the service was fast and pleasant."}
{"text":"Management contacted me to address my concerns and complaints which was appreciated. Since we have frequented this particular store previously, we will be giving them another chance under watchful eyes."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, and delish! Very happy with this location and staff. Not to mention they have the cool Coke machine with the large variety of soda selections. This is our new Port of Subs go to location!"}
{"text":"I came to Port of Suns with a hope and a dream... a hope and a dream of finding a tasty lunch, but my hopes were dashed when the sub was a flub (Hey!! I rhymed!)   I had the #18 on a flatbread with their mayonnaise and mustard sauce; with extra mayo of course. Lettuce, tomato, onions, and a few jalepenos. I thought I'd be in skinny-fat-girl heaven, but not so much.   It was weird, it was like there was no flavor at all. It almost seemed like the meat they were using was the low-sodium heart healthy junk that taste like nothing, but has meat texture. All I tasted was the doughy flatbread. I ate half of it (but only because i was starving and already committed) and called it a day.  My boyfriend had a chicken sandwich with cheddar, and he too said all he tasted was his doughy bread.  This place is new and super clean, friendly staff, the subs just aren't very good. Next time, I'll be going to Subway-- which isn't incredible, but is leaps and bounds tastier than Port of Subs."}
{"text":"We order lunch for our shop from here every week. Ingredients are always fresh,  delivery is quick and everyone is polite.  They seem to remember us which is nice.  I get the tuna every time. I love that it is solid white , as opposed to chunk light. Veggies are crisp , bread doesn't come soggy like other port of subs. I'd recommend for lunch or an on the go sandwich."}
{"text":"Nope won't be returning.  Pulled up no one in the place.  Not a customer.  Not an employee.  Was it robbed?  Was everyone locked up?  Nope but they might have been partying in the back because they were creepy pleasant when they came out front to wait on me.  Ordered tuna but it could have been chicken cause it sure didn't have any flavor.  Very bland.  Looking forward to sour dough but the bread wasn't good either.  Manager you need to mystery dine."}
{"text":"Port of Subs. It is one of the best place to get the sandwich. Ordered the classic sub with tuna salad. The veggies or always fresh. The price is reasonable, go get one. It's a nice place to hang out with your beloved ones."}
{"text":"Yuck!  Why did I do this to myself?  I was running a few errands on Christmas eve afternoon and I decided to grab a sandwich for lunch.    I could tell these poor bastards running the place didn't want to be there but I wasn't making it hard on them, I just wanted a vegetarian sub.  The bread was old and smushed (resembling a slice of plain white bread) the toppings were unimaginative and sparce and the cheese was overly processed into something resembling Velveta.  If you want a sandwhich, don't waste your time here... Einstein's, Quizno's, even Subway could do better."}
{"text":"I was recommended Port of Subs by my coworkers, but I was pretty disappointed upon trying it. Maybe it was just that day, but my bread was horribly dry, there was a very thin amount of meat on my sandwich, and to be frank, no one was friendly. I've made better sandwiches at home... by myself... and the company was better, too."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Port of Subs since I moved out here to Phoenix back in 2005.  I love everything about them, and last night was no exception. It was Friday night and I was hungry!!!  But, of all the port of subs, this ones open nice and late.  9PM during the week!!!  In other port of subs reviews, I have openly complained about the horrible hours that the hold, such as closing early (like 6PM on week nights) and some are closed on sundays....others close at 4PM on Saturdays.  Really? lunch only? you can't do like 7PM?  So this one's my favorite just due to the hours alone.  I came here with my friend after hitting up a few other places. It's located right next to Lowe's in a little strip mall.  I went with the turkey and pastrami 5 inch sub as I always did, and really enjoyed it.  Staff was friendly, and food was prepared quickly.  I will be back, and enjoy myself every time I'm here!"}
{"text":"dew bow bow.ooooooo yyyyeeeaaaa.....dew bow bow.  This is the song that I should be singing, as I slowly enter the Port of Subs after deboarding the light rail.  Port of Subs is my drug of choice, and eating such tasty subs makes me happy.  I got 12 inches last night...12 inches of subs....and it tasted so good!  nomnomnomnom!  Port of Subs never fails me.  Its just so good!  All bread cooked on site, and not like the chain sub places, its actually really really good!  I got the #18, lots of meat and whatever I wanted.  Tasty!  Thank you Port of Subs, thank you.  Eating here makes my brain and stomach delightfully happy!"}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs, and discovered this one near my new job that I started this week. I like it here for a few different reasons, and they have a lot going for them.  I noticed a few low reviews, but wanted to chime in and give my two cents as to how much I like it here.  For starters, they have two lines, which really helps since it seems to be in a busy part of town. There's a lot of business's around and it's close to the airport so I'm sure they get a lot of foot traffic going in and out.  I like that they have two service lines, so there's literally no wait here for getting your food in a short amount of time.  The staff here has been really nice, and seem to get my order out quickly.  The downside? For starters, the drink station was kinda dirty today, and even though there was a staff member there when I went to refill my drink, she didn't seem to try to clean up the watery mess from someone who must have made a mess between the time I got my first drink and the 15 minutes later when I went to go refill my cup. It appeared that someone splashed a bunch of water all over the counter or ice cubes had been spilled and melted and caused a bit off a pool of water.  It was somewhat disarming since I was in work clothes and didn't want to get stains on my shirt, and I had a book with me and really didn't want to get that wet either.    They seem to get a lot of repeat business here since it is in somewhat of a business district. I know they do a punch card system, and I didn't think about it until much later in the day and wish a staff member had said something. I guess they must not be big on enforcing it? Seems like other business's are jamming punch cards down my throat to get me back in the door, but not this port of subs.  Overall a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back in the future."}
{"text":"I love port of subs!  OMG this place rocks!  Everything here is fresh on site.  The bread is cooked and fresh, and they have white, wheat and Sourdough.  They have 3 sized subs, and a menu a mile long.  They have 18 cold subs to choose from, and some hot subs to choose as well.  They cut the meat as you order your sandwich. Not predone like other lame chains that shall go unnamed.  I usually get a #18, which is Roast Beef and Turkey with cheese.  mmmm, tasty.  I usually order a really big sub, eat half there, and take the other half home to eat for later.  I like it here because I really feel like I get a lot of food for my money.  There are two reasons why I gave them 4 stars.  First, this location has really crappy hours.  They close early, and sometimes, I can't get to them before they close.  I think they close at like 6PM or something.  booo!  Who are you catering to with this schedule?  I think they should be open until at least 8 PM.  so, points lost for crappy hours.  The other thing I am docking them for, was I had a bad service experience there today.  There were 3 people working behind the counter that I could see.  One girl slicing meat, one guy running the register, and a third guy doing stock and stuff with bread in the oven.  Well, since I got the combo meal which includes a beverage and chips, I went to the chip area and it looked pretty hit and wiped out.  The only chips left were the crappy flavors that I do not like.  I want plain chips, thats all.  I didnt want jalapeno (stomach doesnt like it) nor did I want the Dill flavored either.  I asked the gentleman who was doing bread and stock if he had any plain chips available.  He was rather snappy with me and said \"if we had them, they would be out there.  Whatever we have is on the shelf.\"  He quickly blew me off, and I was aggrivated.  He told me to look at the other chip stand to see if I could find what I was looking for.   Fortunately, I got my plain chips, but nothing irriates me more then the annoying response of \"If we had it, it would be out there.\"  Bullsh!t! Your just to lazy to go look.  I know you have cases of chips in the back, so stop stocking your cups and get me some chips.  Aside from the snotty stocker guy, the other two people working there were wonderful.   The register guy wrapped one half of my sandwich for me to go, and served the other one for me to stay and eat in the resturant."}
{"text":"I came here today after swimming, and was starving.  I saw it on the way to the pool and stopped in after I was heading home.  For starters, this port of subs has the best hours.  Every other one I've been to has closed at some ridiculously early hour.  This ones open until 8 on sundays, when others are either closed entirely or close at 4. Brownie points for being open \"late.\"  (later then other locations)  Service was quick and efficent, and my sub was delicious.  I went with the #18 and it came out great.  Love port of subs, and will be back if I'm ever on this side of town again."}
{"text":"I LOVE Port of Subs.   I could eat here and never get sick of the food or the menu items. But, the service here on Sunday left me upset, sad and slightly irritated and annoyed! I've never been to this specific location, but on Sunday I wanted to take some friends on the light rail and then go here for lunch while the weather was still comfortable and nice.  I know this place is near campus, and they probably get a lot of student riff raff, but I was a bit annoyed with the service that I recieved here.  Actually, I'm still bothered almost a day later.  I will attribute it to the fact that its students that were working here behind the counter.  Anyways, for starters, I called here before hand to ask a few location questions.  These girls had NO idea where they were located.  Really, they didn't.  They couldn't tell me not only where they were close to, but had NO idea how far from the light rail they were.  I knew where she was better then she did!  I told her which one of the two stops would be closer for me to deboard at, and she had no clue.  I had to get out my light rail map at home to figure out where they were.  She was totally useless!  I only knew where to go because she told me she was near smashburger...and I figured out where to go from there.  So friends and I take the light rail down to the College/Veterans Way exit.  We walk to the port of subs and I realize that I have to go to the bathroom.  I was mentioning it to my friends as we walked into the store, and out of no where, some girl at a table boasts out \"WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC BATHROOMS IF YOU NEED TO GO YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AT SUBWAY BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING.\"  Um, I wasn't only NOT talking to her, but the fact that she took it upon herself to YELL it at me as I'm setting foot in the store is a whole different story.  I was SO annoyed!  I mentioned to the service girl who was on break eating a sub that I wasn't addressing her about my bathroom concerns she responded with \"Well, I couldn't help but hear you when you came in.\"  REALLY?!?!?!   STFU please!  Your probably the same girl who answered the phone and doesn't know where your located at!  Ugh, the food was good, but the two idiot ding dongs behind the counter need retraining and need to learn to not be beotches!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty little sandwich. I agree with all the other reviews service is sub par. Seems like a place where the people who got rejected from subway work. The boy who made my sandwich was a greasy little booger who normally I probably would of voted against making my sandwich, but since they were busy I gave in.  Sandwich on its own was very tasty. The bread was tender and chewy, meat fresh sliced, pickles tomatoes and lettuced seemed very fresh. Would of liked a lite mayo option but oh well.  I will be back."}
{"text":"About to move into the area and meantime staying at an airbnb very near this place. Was looking for a quick, somewhat healthy alternative to fast food. This place was fast, clean, fresh and GOOD. I got there 15min before closing but still got excellent customer service. Despite the fact that I mentioned 2x NO ONIONS and still got onions on my sandwich, I would go back because of the employees good attitudes."}
{"text":"Bread was flat had the #15 G had #1 taste wise is better then subway. Sat down all was good. Restrooms are locked for good measure!? ASK 4 THE KEY AT THIS LOCATION. Was clean and tidy.I won't be coming back to this location. We had an appointment on this side of town. We will try the location at centennial. We had super high hopes because we read the yelpers YELPS.If I had known, this location would have been a pass. I'm sure the locals are fine with the locked restrooms. This is a 1 star because of the restrooms."}
{"text":"My favorite Port of Subs location by far!  The staff here are full of personality and know how to deliver warm welcomed customer service! And I was beginning to think that was a lost art out here in Southern Nevada!   The food is made fresh for you with fresh sliced deli meats and cheese and your choice of veggies! I had a Grilled Pastrami sandwich (haven't had one of those in years!) it was actually really really good! My coworker got a meatball marinara sandwich...it's her usual! And let me tell ya...those balls were big and juicy!    Welp...My total for 2 medium sandwiches 2 chips and 2 drinks came out to be almost $21...eek kinda expensive I know! But the food isn't bad and the customer service is what will keep me coming back whenever I'm scheduled to work in the Henderson area!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars  First time in I had the #1  Ham, salami, capicolla, pepperoni & provolone   The meat and cheese were sliced to order, the veggies and bread tasted fresh. What else do you need a good tasting sandwich fast.   I would compare the quality to jersey mikes but at subway prices.   Ignore the negative reviews, I have lived across the street for months and out off visiting because the stars were low. I messed up this will be a regular lunch spot from now on."}
{"text":"Very underrated location, and best location I've been to since the service was top notch!  The lady and I stopped by today with post-workout munchies, a Monday evening around 6-7pm, and there were 2 gentlemen behind the counter. I forgot the other fellas name, but the guy serving us was named 'Mat'. I've had better customer service with him than a server at a top notch restaurant per say.  He was very energetic and we talked about working out, and he even went as far as shooting some info about a certain supplement.  As far as the food- my girlfriend had no complaints about her turkey and provolone. I had a hot sandwich- a ny steak and provolone. He had told me he cut the meat extra thin and said how it'll taste great and won't be so hard-textured, since it's thin cut.   Great guy, great service. Clean environment. Good portion sandwich, and actually filled me up, *surprisingly*. 10/10"}
{"text":"I have never been inside the restaurant. I work close by and order delivery often. It's always exactly what I ordered and on time. Easy online ordering and tasty sandwiches with lots of variety.  Better than subway and Quiznos"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch for the first time and I thought the food was really good. The lady made me a monster of a sandwich which I ended up taking half of it home with me. The flavors were great and the bread was fresh and delicious.   The quality seemed much higher than other fast food sandwich shops but to me they lack in having different choices. Which may be a good thing though, since they can concentrate on making higher grade food than having to deal with a huge menu (quality not quantity sorta thing).  I would for sure go back here, I saw there is one up in WA State (my neck of the woods) so I will have to go hunt that one down and see if it lives up to my Vegas Port of Subs experience."}
{"text":"POS is by far my favorite sub place.  Beats the other restaurants hands down, but I visited this particular location and the doors were lock 15 minutes prior to the schedule.  That is it, everything else is great."}
{"text":"I thought I loved Port of Subs, but I was wrong.  I currently sit eating the Vegetarian sub (3rd time I have had it) and I am super disappointed. The bread is really dry, despite the fact that I have oil, vinegar and mayo on it, and it is pretty tasteless.  The cheese is good and the fact that you have multiple size options is cool, but the sandwich is really blah and unimpressive.   Blimpie, Cousins or Subway are all way better. ... but if you are over in this area go to Lee's Sandwiches on Dobson/Warner instead. It's worth the 5 mile drive."}
{"text":"First time here. Last time here  I ordered a medium roast beef, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, oil, vinegar, salt, pepper on sour dough.  The only thing I tasted was the onion. The roast beef was fatty, chewy, with no taste .  My ice tea was good.  We were the only ones in the store and the server could not remember what we wanted. He must have asked 5 times.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Always fast friendly service, good food at acceptable prices. Recommend it!"}
{"text":"I purchased two subs (roast beef and pastrami),  my first time buying anything and I will never go back. The bread isn't all that fresh to me and neither is the meat. It smelled like it was just starting to spoil. The service was bad. She needed more pickles while making my sandwich so she put her hand in a container and grabbed a handful while dripping pickle juice every where then she used the same plastic glove wet with pickle juice to fix my sandwich. When I said I don't like my bread wet she was dumb founded as if she had no idea she was doing something wrong. NOT A PLACE YOU WANT TO VISIT."}
{"text":"I love this location! Everyone is always friendly and never seems annoyed when I order a complicated sandwich. Some other locations seem frustrated!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am a regular here and always come with good company, so life seems better!  THE FOOD  Sandwiches. Hot and cold. I prefer cold and they make them just fine. I would say the sandwiches are not soggie like Subway's gets to be. Quiznos bread to me is a bit better. Smoothies are also quite good for the price. Prices are reasonable.   SETTING This is a typical corner sandwich shop. Tables are clean, the place is well lit and it doesn't feel crowded  SERVICE Always good and patient even if you somehow manage to forget what you were about to order. If you are a regular, your sandwich might even be made without you saying anything.  OVERALL Good place to have lunch. Getting every 12th sandwich for free as part of their loyalty \"eater\" program makes it that much better."}
{"text":"I freakin' LOVE this place!  The subs are DELICIOUS and priced well. The people who work at this location are all very friendly, fast, and helpful. Be sure to get a loyalty card with them. I go so often that I've already gotten tons of free stuff."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out since they don't have these back in The Bay. Favorite place to get a sandwich now, come here all the time! I craved these bad boys all throughout my pregnancy, lol.  Only bad experience I had was one time I came about half an hour before closing and the employee locked the door on me, rude!"}
{"text":"MAN I JUST DON'T GET IT. Does America really need another forgettable sub sandwich chain?   No matter how you slice it (no pun intended) it's just meat on bread with some add-ons. Overpriced. Totally forgettable. I won't be back.   There's a Quizno's around the corner if you want slightly better forgettable subs. Otherwise eat before you get to the airport."}
{"text":"Never going back here again. We used to go here often, but the service is horrendous. This was not my first time getting crappy service. We walked in for a sandwich and they proceeded to take care of any smoothie orders first, even if they walked in after us.  The guy working then proceeded to clean the slicer with a gross wet towel.  When he was done, he said I hope you don't want turkey because we're out. That would have been some helpful information 10 minutes ago when we walked in, as we both wanted turkey sandwiches.  Not to mention what sub shop runs out of turkey on a Sunday? They didn't seem to have a problem posting signs all over of the coupon they would not accept."}
{"text":"Despite the bad reviews for staff we decided to check it out because everybody like the food. It's obvious somebody's trying to change the bad staff situation. Bill and Tennessee were super friendly and greet us when we walked in the door the store was very clean. They work to make our order just the way we wanted it. The sandwich #1 tasted very good, as did mu wife's salad. We would go back."}
{"text":"I used to live off this place. They cut their meats and cheeses fresh like a real deli, so already it kicks the shit out of Subway, Quiznos, and every other fast food deli chain that offers up pre-packaged meats. Their bread and cookies are fresh as well. For some reason, this location has better tasting food than any other Port-o-Subs I've been to. Don't know why.  There's always a long line at lunch, but it moves fast. There's some good people watching to be done here - cops eat here, firemen eat here, doctors and nurses eat here, and you also get the entire spectrum of downtown Scottsdale folk... sometimes you would think you arrived at a costume party or they are filming a new Village People video. I don't know what it is and I don't know that it matters either, but good looking people eat here. Whatever you want to make of that...   Most of the people that work here are really nice and competent. They keep this place pretty clean as well. Once I noticed some fruit flies buzzing around by the soda machine and was told they sometimes come with the fresh fruit they get for the smoothies (which are fantastic). Outside of that, I can't complain about this sub shop and I eat here all the time... it's almost just about as good as a non-chain place."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't a huge fan of this Port of Subs - or any for that matter. But as happens occasionally convenience trumped all else and I ended up eating a sandwich from here about once every couple of weeks.  It took a few trips worth of trying different sandwiches before I found the one to my liking, none were bad per se; but now that I have a favorite I haven't changed it in almost a year.  In my book fresh sliced meet always beats out the pre-sliced stuff at Subway. Add to that fresh assortment of vegetables like you can find anywhere else and you've got a passable sandwich. The location is often busy at the expected times and the restaurant itself is nothing special, but if you are looking for a good sandwich without having to leave north Scottsdale in search of a Blimpies or Mr. Goodscents this place will do.   For my money it's the #18 on wheat with the mayo/mustard mix, black olives, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes. Yum."}
{"text":"This port of subs gets pretty busy around noon, even though they have 2 lines going for them.  It is a chain shop, its gonna be hard to get a super review from me.  They have a lunch card but don't go out of their way to give it to you and the 13th sandwich is free which makes it quite an effort to get an average of less than $.50 off each sandwich.  The card seems to work at different locations tho.  As for staying open at night... I don't have any experience with that.  I suspect it has more to do with lack of business than being in a 'bad' neighborhood.  Its a business district close to the airport.  There aren't a huge amount of residence nearby that would give enough business to justify paying 2-3 people all night to keep it open."}
{"text":"They have great basic subs. Freshly sliced and I love the bread. Yum! They are a little slow but it's our go to"}
{"text":"Can I start out by saying how refreshing it is to have GREAT customer service? Somthing that is rare now a days... Damen welcomed me to port of subs, my sandwich was prefect and there was no wait. I will be returning. Thank you for taking a few extra minutes to make a good experience!"}
{"text":"I have to write another review for this location because there customer service is out of this world! Due to a fire in there building this location was closed for over 3 months. Before the fire I came here at least once a week. Today I came in for the first time after the fire, besides being greeted with smiles from the whole staff one of the guys already knew my sandwich . After being closed for months and making hundreds of sandwiches. Good food feeds my stomach but great customer service wins my return! WELCOME BACK"}
{"text":"This is the best Port of Subs. The bread is always fresh and the people that work here are amazing. Thanks for the great customer service and great sandwiches. I will for sure be back to eat here."}
{"text":"This Port of Subs was great. 0 issues. When I first walked in they seemed a little busy. One of the employees yelled back and said that she needed help. Guess that's a good sign for the store.  My sub was great. Made just the way I wanted it. Working TVs hanging around the dining room. \"Cops Reloaded\" was on! Ha!  Added bonus to this store is that this is the Port of Subs Floyd Mayweather apparently goes to because his bank shares parking lot with it.  Don't get knock out!"}
{"text":"I'm a sandwich lover! I frequent various sandwich places often but I have to say Port of Subs is really special because they offer smoked meat and cheese options! They were understaffed when I went to this location but the young lady did not miss a beat when it comes to sanitary precautions such as re-washing her hands and changing her gloves as she managed money and other surfaces. Kudos to her! Oh, and my #5 was great!"}
{"text":"This will be the last time I spend money in a Port of Subs. Order taking was awful!! None of us got what we wanted and don't even ask about grilling it!!"}
{"text":"I was so hoping I'd love Port of Subs because they have so many locations in Vegas but I concluded it's only OK.  The service was good.  Helpful cashier and quick sandwich maker but the product ... meats and cheese were freshly sliced and tasty but the bread wasn't as substantial and wasn't as tasty as some other sandwich shops.  The prices are good but not so good as to overcome the feeling that you're missing out by not spending a bit more across the street."}
{"text":"Typical Port of Subs food, which means it's pretty good but not the best in town.  One problem with this location is that they don't seem to want to sell gift cards.  Cash or debit card only, and debit card use comes with a fee.  Credit card is fine for the food so not sure what the issue is."}
{"text":"Best location!! They always have great customer service! They get me in and out on my lunch break. The sandwiches are put together well and not all sloppy like some of the other locations make them. Also they actually put a good amount of meat on the sandwiches. I will drive a little further just to go to this location instead of the one by my house. 5 starts from me :)"}
{"text":"So the whole shtick is that they cut the meat and cheese for each customer instead of being pre-sliced. Not sure that this business model makes any sense because it is SLOW. If there is any kind of line you are in for a long wait.   And the sandwiches are ok."}
{"text":"It's a sandwich shop. Really.  No sandwich shop can be 5 stars. Anyways fresh bread and freshly sliced processed meats and cheeses.  Just like mom used to make ! Lol I always feel like I ate 6000 mg of salt after a sandwich. But that's ok. I don't need to eat for the next 2 weeks anyways. I recommend avocado on every sandwich..... I say that because every time I try to get avocado they never have any."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Subway a lot, but Port of Subs is so much better.  The people who work here are friendly, as well.  I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great first experience, and delicious fresh food. I was taken care of by Richard, and he assured I felt welcomed and satisfied with my order from beginning to end. The food is reasonably priced, and the choices are endless. The B.L.T from the Hot Subs menu was a good choice. I will definitely come back. Friendly staff and great place to chill."}
{"text":"This is one great little place of the whole chain.  People are super friendly, addressing you even if they're super busy, and the sandwiches always come out not bad at all.  Not all their little places are as good, but this spot is one of the better ones!"}
{"text":"Not always the best service but fabulous sandwiches!! I can't even eat at subway after eating here.  I love the meat being sliced fresh in front of you.  There mustard mayo mix is a must!! They also have a port of subs card which is kind of like a frys card and it offers rewards/perks for a certain amount of money spent."}
{"text":"This is a super close to work so I decided to pop in for lunch. I have never been to a Port of Subs before.  I got a small (5 inch) sandwich that was their limited time/special sandwich-bacon, turkey,provolone and avocado. They have the usual toppings that you can elect to have: lettuce, tomato, red onion. olives, etc. They also have the oil&vinegar, mayo, mustard, salt and pepper and they have dried oregano too.   I got it as a meal with drink and chips and it was $8 and some change.   The sandwich had fresh sliced meats, but it's not like it made a significant difference from any other deli sliced sandwich shops. The veggie toppings weren't as fresh. There was no lid on the mayo or mustard and salads (mac, potato and tuna salad) which makes it build a \"crust\" where it oxidized. Overall sandwich was just okay.  For the price, and especially since Subway is across the street- I don't know how they make business. I was the only one there during prime lunch time with one to-go order. At least at subway I can get a $5 footlong of a sliced turkey sandwich and have half left for later. Same taste but more sauce ,bread, and topping selections there for a better price. Guess where I'm going for my next work lunch sandwich?"}
{"text":"Ya another chain, I know but get over it!  This location is almost never busy.  It's tucked away next to Sauce and on the other side of The Living Room.  I am always greeted with a friendly hello and served promptly.  This location is super clean too.  I cannot stand it when the soda station is sticky and messy but not here....they keep it very clean and organized.    They don't have as many items on their menu but what they have they do very well.  The bread is always fresh and the veggies are crisp.  I'm guessing they do a good business at lunchtime due to the other businesses around them.  I've been in on off hours and I'm usually the only one there or there is one other person.  Overall this is a great location!"}
{"text":"Great subs, friendly staff.  Was in town and ended up coming here a few days in a row because it was the best/healthiest option around."}
{"text":"I'm totally disappointed. The sandwich was pretty boring. Although they get kudos for slicing the meat right in front of me. Otherwise, there's just nothing appetizing about their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. The store is well kept and clean. Owner Hollis is very involved in his store and community and the staff there are very professional and fast !"}
{"text":"I love the italian subs!  And there fruit punch!"}
{"text":"Stopped here by chance the other night just looking for a quick bite to eat.  Staff was very friendly and service was very quick.  Sandwich was very fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"3 of us walked in at 6:20 pm tonight (Saturday) and we were told you are OUT of white bread, due to catering. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!  I will be calling a g.m./ owner on Monday AND corporate."}
{"text":"First time eating at a port of subs and I'm pretty grossed out. The gal making my sandwich comes out with gloves on, wipes her gloved hands with a discolored brown towel they use to wipe off surfaces and knives! I asked her to change gloves please. Ugh! So disgusting. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Now I love port of subs, don't get me wrong, but I've had a few issues with this place. First, the good. Most of the staff is super friendly. I will love any sandwich shop that stocks sourdough and theirs is awesome. I love that they fresh cut all of their deli meats and cheeses- I'm not sure if it's really any better than pre-sliced cold cuts, but it certainly lends it an authentic touch. There is a huge selection of different meats and cheeses, including smoked cheddar which I'd never seen at another sandwich place. And of course their mayo- mustard spread is delicious! I always get more than I should because it's that good and sourdough needs it.  The bad. Sometimes they are out of sourdough. And I have had a staff member (I think it may have been the owner as she was in a fancy dress and not a uniform) try to discourage me from ordering sourdough. She was talking about how hard it was, was I sure, sourdough is so hard, every other bread is made fresh, she didn't know how old the sourdough was... YES I WANT THE SOURDOUGH! Staff is not always on top of things: i came in after a couple who were ordering several different sandwiches and both staff members were helping them while I stood there waiting for my ONE sandwich for about 8 minutes. I feel like there should be one staff member helping each party, especially in that situation.  And of course- the reason I go here is because of the delicious sandwiches (on sourdough!)."}
{"text":"Only my second time having Port of Subs and I can say that I am not a fan of this location. The other location was much, much better. This one is really small and I ended up eating just the insides of my sandwich because my bread was overdone and tasted funny. Went in around lunchtime and there was a bit of a line. I don't mind the wait but don't like feeling rushed when it is my turn which is exactly how the people doing the toppings made me feel. The staff was hit or miss... two of them seemed nice and friendly and the other two didn't seem like they were having a good day. They also lack some organization and if I have to tell the person at the register what I ordered that's probably not good because I can just say I ordered the cheapest one.   +1 for the chocolate chip cookies being delicious!"}
{"text":"I give 4 stars for Smoothie King and probably only 3 for Port of Subs.  When you're tired of Jamba and you want something a little bit different, Smoothie King is a good option.    Like Jamba, they have a huge list of smoothies to choose from, that range from low fat to high protein.  You can also create your own smoothie and add in a variety of healthy supplements.  If you go on their website, they've made it really easy for you to learn how many calories and fat grams are in each smoothie, so if you're trying to watch your weight, you'll want to stay far, far away from peanut power. It's like 500 and something calories and 20 grams of fat.  In a drink! But it's good. I guess you can't win them all.   The cool thing is that they offer a lot of low fat/calorie options that are still really good.   But as for the Port of Subs...Meh. I just think they're okay.  I'd rather eat at Quizno's or somewhere. Maybe even Subway and I'm not the biggest fan of that place."}
{"text":"Ordered my usual, which is consistently quite tasty, but when I got home and took a bite: dry, crumbly wheat roll ruined the experience. Isn't there a Port O' Subs rule about when to throw out old bread?"}
{"text":"Better then quiznos and subway and give larger portions."}
{"text":"Best Port of Subs I think I ever been to!  Some people might think the location is strange, being attached to a gas station and all.  But, by far the friendliest staff ever!!  Always a pleasure coming to this location."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs, just not this location!  I've never been impressed with this location, but last time I went there, they cut the meat so thin, it was falling apart!  The capicola actually had holes in it!  Other Port of Subs in town much better.  Yea, dirty place, dirty employees, horrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service at this location! Employees are willing to assist with anything and are very friendly. It's a great place to go for lunch - lines aren't usually long and sandwiches are made to order very quickly! :)"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Employees were closing up shop at 7:30pm on a Monday when we walked in... But they close at 9! They made us feel unwelcome and took excessive time taking our order and making the sandwich. Not once were we made to feel welcome as customers and I won't be going back. The associates (Sammie B , Gabe and one other) were unwelcoming and proceeded to ignore us while they focused on cleaning. Gabe finally made our sandwiches painstakingly slow, I think I would have enjoyed watching grass grow since that would've been faster. If you want something to eat close there are so many other restaurants nearby, spend your money where it is appreciated!!!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever I love port of subs but this location! I should have known when walking in there and no one there! There where flys to and nothing looked fresh! I can't even finish my meal I'm disgusted never going back ! 0 stars but have to select one :/ horrible!"}
{"text":"I love port of subs but not this location in particular. I've been here 3 times to 'give them another chance'. Same crap every time. Rude staff and the person making the sub for some reason feels the need to lay the hand/hammer of Thor on top of the sandwich before wrapping it up. Maybe this location needs to be retrained. I don't know.. just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"Its not hard to make a sub.... I've never been to a Port of Subs. I can not believe this location is in business. The bread wasn't cooked... The lady who sliced the meat was wiping the blade with nasty towel... Corporate needs to look at this location."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is amazing! Whenever we come to this location the staff is always very friendly, Miguel in particular is always awesome and makes me laugh every time. For the service alone this place gets 5 stars but the food is always good quality as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! Variety is the spice of life? Nope, I choose this place every time!  The workers are welcoming  and generous with the fresh toppings. My favorite item is the wheat wrap turkey combo #8. I always go here when I'm about to catch the bus and never have to worry about being late. Best sandwich place I've had yet."}
{"text":"Bread is always overlooked burnt top on white bread again.  Third week.  Dark sales area. Need some lighting on menu board."}
{"text":"First time trying them. It was good! Plus I get a work discount. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I prefer port of subs over their competitors (subway, jimmy johns, etc.) because their food tastes fresh but I especially like this location because of the staff. I've started coming in somewhat regularly and they always greet me when I walk in and say goodbye when I leave. Even from the first time I came in they treated me like a regular. The manager and the workers Ive encountered make conversation when they're less busy and are just really nice."}
{"text":"Great sub and very fresh.  They slice the meat when you order the sub and it seem much bigger than what you get at Subway and the others.    I ordered a No. 1 and it was yummy."}
{"text":"So excited this location is open right down the street from the office. No more subway! Brand new, clean and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not a meat person but they put almost NO meat on this bread sandwich.  Why even bother when Subway is right down the street?"}
{"text":"This place just isn't that great. It's a typical sandwich shop, to the tune of Subway or Jersey Mike's, but I think I'd prefer them to Port of Subs. The bread ... I'd be happier with a store-bought potato roll. And, truly, you can't do much harm to a veggie sub. But for items like the steak sub with A1, there's plenty to be desired. Flavor would be a factor. Even doused in A1 (which I could put on absolutely anything, LOVE A1), the lack of quality in the beef could not be masked.  The tuna salad is somehow strangely fishy -- it's potent, which sends a red flag message to me.  I'm sure if I somehow was manipulated and kidknapped and ended up stuck at a timeshare sales office for 6 hours, this would be a welcome treat. But I think, after disappointment after disappointment, I'll just go back to my regular sammich joints."}
{"text":"I wanted something delicious and a bit healthier than your typical fastfood joints, so I chose to visit this Port of Subs. It was near the Lowes that I was going to. What immediately caught my attention was the griller collection, preferably the pastrami! I added some provolone cheese, pickles, mustard, pepperoncinis, tomatoes & red onions. How ever they crafted my sandwich, it was sheer perfection! I highly enjoyed my meal earlier today.  Not only because it was delicious, the staff was just amazing! Kurtis, Tina & George, were exceptional! Very courteous, very friendly, and most importantly, the passion in what they do. I too, work in a customer service industry. So I understand how the system works. I will definitely be coming back to this branch, and tell my friends about it! If you get the chance, swing by and bring them business. You'll be glad that you did! With all the negativity happening all around us, it's refreshing to encounter such a small group that gives such tremendous positive light!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving two stars is because I love the subs, but the service at this particular one sucks.  I asked for jalapeños and they only put 4 individual slices on a 12\" sub. Next they failed to charge me for a second meal deal so I had to pay extra for that. Finally my wife went to throw some trash away and heard the workers talking s#!t about us while we were eating in the store.  I will never go back to this store ever even if I have to drive 5 miles or more out of my way just to avoid going to this store."}
{"text":"Once Again a contender with Subway and Quiznos. In my eyes this place beats them hands down. You can't get much fresher than this, they make to order and they slice the meat right in front of you, its great ! I had a 8\" smoked turkey sandwich with lettuce, onions and jalepenos, bag of port of sub chips jalepeno flavor and a Mountain Dew.  Not much seating inside but very well cooled down, a great place to escape the heat. Two places to order from so the line never got too long. I would like to try one of the hot sandwiches next time."}
{"text":"There is an older gentleman here that is extremely friendly and really went out of his way to take care of me. I highly recommend this location and gentleman."}
{"text":"Brown Lettuce, and Slime coming out of the Ice machine. Fuckin disgusting place, won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Disappointing. New people running this shop. Employees rude. I told him what I wanted on sandwich. When he started adding things I didn't ask for he argued with me that I did. Only asked for mayo and onions,  he wad putting lettuce, pickles, tomatoes. He wanted to argue with me so I left. Won't return. Too nany other Port of Subs in the area."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Two people working behind the counter. Had to wait while the guy made the sandwich for the customer in front of me. He and the customer then had a lengthy conversation that had nothing to do with order. I asked the mananger if she could take mu order. She ignored me and told the other guy she'd be back and walked out of the store. Finally got waited on and  ordered #7 roast beef and provolone. When I got home, the sandwich had absolutely no flavor.  With poor attitude and substandard food won't be back and obviously corporate doesn't care !"}
{"text":"This place is located within the B section of the airport, next to Great Steak. I wanted a sub sandwich for the plane ride because I knew it would hold up pretty good and I was right. I went with the Turkey, Ham and Cheddar with easy mayo lettuce tomato and pickles. My first bite I noticed how fresh the bread was, soft inside with a slight crisp outside. All the ingredients were fresh and tasted really good. Reminded me of Jersey Mikes if you like them. I won't comment on the price because...well...it's in the airport."}
{"text":"Only my second time eating at this location. Today I got a grilled breakfast sandwich. My first time ordering this, and I decided on the turkey sausage, egg and cheese griller. My impression was that the sandwich was like a panini, as it looked in the pictures (they did use a panini press, but they use the same bread they do for the subs, so it didn't get the nice little crunch you get with a panini). I chose smoked cheddar for the cheese, and then asked if they could put some tomato on the sandwich as well. The young lady said she would get the toppings I wanted in a moment, at which time she grilled the sandwich. After she grilled it, she brought it over and asked what I wanted to add to it. I asked for tomato and pepper. She split the sandwich back open and added what I asked for. I would've preferred the tomatoes to be warm like the rest of the ingredients, but they made the sandwich lukewarm when I started eating it. The sandwich was pretty tasty, I should've had a little hot sauce or something though to add a little zing to it. If you've never had it, give it a try. I ordered a Medium, which was 8\", and it was five bucks. Not a bad deal at all."}
{"text":"Bad: cucumbers, lettuce were soggy, not crisp.  medium comes with a small drink, I paid $9.45 for a meal. expensive for me.  Good: The sub was good, I got the #1."}
{"text":"Came in today  Rome and Chris took care of me. He made a excellent sandwich and by far has the best Customer service I've ever seen defiantly will be coming back for the food and the service  great team work !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Port of Subs is my favorite sandwich place.  I love the delicious bread that melts in my mouth and the freshly sliced meat and cheeses.  Usually on weekdays I opt for the Classic Sub #11: Ham & American Cheese.  I like meeting friends for lunch at Port of Subs because there are both healthy options and splurge options to please everyone.   I frequent several locations around town, but this is by far my FAVORITE location!  Everyone is super friendly.  They are also attentive and have memorized what I like to order!  They are also super efficient, which is important because it seems that a lot of the lunch crowd are on short lunch breaks and need something quick. Even when there is a huge lunch rush, they seem to get through the line pretty quickly.  All of the current employees are great sandwich masters.  My sandwiches are not only delicious, but are neatly prepared!    The location is also very clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"So you walk into this great smelling, clean place that is full of smiling folk. Prices are reasonable. Today i had a steak & cheese sub...sure it may not compete with a good ole Philly in Philly but its what we got. Anyway, the bread was fresh and dried, crusty or chewy. It hit the spot. I would definitely take friends to this place. Give it a whirl, you will like em too!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Port of Subs I have dined in at and the service is not so great. The first location I went to was on 215/Decatur. Horrible service as well. I ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich. The sandwich maker didn't ask what kind of bread, rather she assumed I wanted wheat, she didn't ask if I would like t toasted. I notice the lettuce and veggies were old, brown and soggy so I asked if they had a new batch to serve and she said \" no just cause it has a few browns in the lettuce, it's still good\". I was like nevermind you ignored my question and just made my sandwich feel less appetizing. She went on to making 3 other people's sandwiches before asking if that's all i wanted and if I was dinning in or to-go. I just don't understand Port of Subs  employment standards but I think I'm going back to Eating Fresh at Subway!"}
{"text":"Sanwiches are good except the bread is horrible.  It always tastes stale.  Bad bread ruins a sandwich even if everything in the sandwich is good."}
{"text":"Good experience at this port of subs. I go to them quite often since the meats and cheeses are sliced fresh I think it tastes better than subway precut operation. Nevertheless, the service was good and quick. They weren't over talkative but engaging, all that I could ask for from my sandwich artist. The sandwich was fresh and the bread was tasty. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This port of subs is on the corner of Cheyenne and rainbow and the location seems like it never gets busy, which is one of my favorite things about it. The service is always on point and the sandwiches are always fresh. I get the number 2 on wheat with everything and extra lettuce. Check it out."}
{"text":"Go here. They really care about good service and the meats are really fresh. The workers are always friendly and when I ask you how your day's been the sandwiches are always fresh and prepared exactly the way I want them. Overall the entire experience has 5 stars and I just wish it were a little closer to my house because it seems like I go to them everyday."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here this morning to get a BLT. We have ordered these many times but we had not been here in a while and we were craving it so decided to come in. The place smelled great and there were a few signs posted indicating there was some construction in process but really clean. We were the only ones there so I proceeded to sit at one of the tables. My wife just had eye surgery and asked the lady behind the counter for a hand menu because the one on top had a bad glare and she couldn't see it well. She was handed a menu to look at but she changed her mind because we decided to get the BLT (bacon, lettuce and tomato) sub instead. The lady working behind the counter was right there in front of us when we told her we were going to do a BLT. My wife asked if I was getting a large ($7.99) sub and i let her know that I was. My wife suggested we get the XL ($13.99) sub because this one is 24 inches long and it was cheaper than buying two large subs. The lady who was making our subs listened to our conversation and my wife looked at her and confirmed that we would be doing an XL BLT sub. She asked if we wanted it grilled and we let her know that we did not (I wasn't really surprised by this question because I thought that was their way of asking if we wanted our bread toasted, the way the Subway does). We then proceeded to letting her know what we wanted on our sandwiches and my wife made several mentions that on my half of the sand which I wanted some items to be different. She completed our sandwiches and we were really happy with the service up until the time that we had to pay for the sandwiches. When my wife reached the register the lady who made our sandwiches then said \"oh by the way, BLTs are considered \"Grillers\" now so I have to ring them up as two large sandwiches\". We asked what she was talking about and she said that the menu had changed and that they don't make XL BLTs anymore, that they have to be ringed up as two large bacon Grillers and that each sub is $9.29 each plus tax! Seriously??!!! For a bacon sandwich? And why was this not brought up when we ordered and XL BLT????? Needles to say that I won't be coming back. I understand that it was posted on the menu but my wife was the one ordering and the lady knew she couldn't see the menu very well. When we started to order an XL would have been a great time to say \"sorry but we can't make XL BLTs anymore\" and to point out to the change in the menu! I'm so upset right now and feel that she purposely went on to make our sandwiches knowing that we did not realize that that change had been made."}
{"text":"I just moved down here from Reno Nevada where there are port of subs everywhere and I loved it. They were my favorite sub shop to go to. As of yesterday I will never go back. My fiancé had a sandwich from there about two months ago and his stomach was so messed up I told him to get over it because I thought he just wasn't used to sandwiches like that. But yesterday I got the #1 and I was up all night with freaking food poisoning and that's all I had to eat yesterday I had half for lunch and half for dinner. Now I'm stuck in bed with plaid poisoning because they don't know how to keep clean or have anything fresh."}
{"text":"I'm eating a turkey sandwich as I type this.   Is it really 4-star quality? Probably not, but I have had a total of eight hours of sleep and three meals in four days (no exaggeration) while researching every poker room in Vegas (almost) for a book. So, it tastes pretty damn good to me. Plus, the service was very friendly, so that's a star boost.   If I had to describe this sandwich in one word, it would be \"simple.\" I have been going to Vegas the past three summers for poker, and I always get this sandwich on the way home. It always tastes \"simple.\"   This is good because it's really challenging to find a good sandwich in an airport, kind of like trying to find Waldo while wearing a blindfold.   Now let's talk about Mrs. Fields. When I first met her, I was in love with her, but we went our separate ways for a while due to a geographical location change on my end. When we got together again years later, I thought it would be amazing, but something was off. I ghosted her for years after that, but now she has found me again at Port of Subs at the Las Vegas airport. I know what you're thinking, but I had to give her another try because of the way she was looking at me on the other side of the glass. If I had to describe her in one word, it would be \"scrumptious.\""}
{"text":"And I came from California hungry and had a great Korean barbecue sub and awesome dessert! The owner was super friendly and the prices are good too. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am always greeted with great service, the employees always make my sandwich to perfection. The owner is very kind. This store is always clean every time I come in. This is my all time favorite sub shop."}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas for 3 years and somehow I'm just now trying this place! With Great Harvest closed today, no Jimmy Johns nearby, and Jersey Mikes long closed, this was our sandwich place of last resort today. It was surprsingly good.   I had the #1.. a basic Italian sub. I would say it's VERY similar to Jersey Mike's and definitely fulfilled a craving. I like that the meats are cut in front of you and they had a nice lineup of hot and cold subs.   Nothing mindblowing, but a great solid sub option in my neighborhood. Thank goodness I will never have to resort to Subway with Port of Subs around !"}
{"text":"We ordered a 6 foot sub with multiple types of meat and they forgot the meat.  Seriously these were the skimpiest sandwiches and there was definitely less than 6 feet of sub here.  They also failed to provide mayo and mustard.  Won't be using them again. I should have just ordered from Fry's. At least it would have been worth the money spent."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Used them to order lunch for my warehouse of 60 people. Port of Subs sent confirmation emails, called when they had questions, helped load my car, and (most important) the order was perfect."}
{"text":"This is the best Port of Subs location in town. I have been in this store when they have been super busy with a line out the door. The team there works extremely well together and they can HUSTLE. I go to this store at least once a week, sometimes twice, and I have NEVER been disappointed with the quality of service. David, the manager, is a valuable resource to the Port of Subs company. If he ever moves to another location, my business will follow him."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and salads here are good but in the last 6 months they have gotten so incredibly slow that the lines are too long to eat here at lunch. I literally just walked in and right back out. Only one side was open even though there was a line to the door. Let's step it up. You wonder why your sales are down? Because your staffing and training are insufficient."}
{"text":"My fave from here is the turkey and provolone!! I've never had port of subs until my husband introduced me to this place. He loves the smoked ham, turkey and smoked cheddar.  Whenever we go the service is always amazing and our sandwiches are usually prepared nicely. You can get your sandwich toasted too which I like! Also the meat is cut fresh right in front of you too! They have a bunch of different toppings to go on your sandwich as well. I don't like to get all of the extra stuff, but you sure get your monies worth with the meat and cheese too."}
{"text":"I was delivered a sandwich yesterday by one sick lady.  When I told her it was not okay for a delivery driver to deliver sick, she simply stated that everyone gets colds and that someone had to do it - oh, and that she didn't MAKE the food.  When I called to complain to the manger, I was told that that is who delivered my sandwich!    I called the owner of the company, Terry Green, and he stated that they had no other option, as everyone was sick and they were short staffed.  Wonder why.  I would guess another employee came to work sick, and made the rest of the staff sick!  I told him that his other option was to not have deliveries for the day!    I would suppose that to some people, their company making money, not paying employees for sick time, is just okay.  The public should beware of someone so careless with our health to make a few dollars!"}
{"text":"This is always my favorite local sandwich shop.It's close to where I work and the staff is always super friendly. The roast beef #7 with chips and their always fresh brownies make a perfect quick lunch. My son got totally spoiled by Gary and his custom made grilled cheese. Two thumbs for Gary and his crew"}
{"text":"I still give it 4 stars for the food in spite of the attitude from the kid tonight it was like i was bothering him to make me a sandwich"}
{"text":"So I got to tell you I love Port of  subs I haven't been to one in a long time just because I don't live close to one but I just went to this one on Indian school and seventh Street and geez I'm coming back for sure it was like less then five bucks for fresh-cut pastrami and Swiss sandwich with like all the fixings it was this really good everything you want trust me go here it was close to closing time and they didn't even like skip a beat thank you port of subs"}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs, but this location sucks balls! EVERY employee in here had a shit attitude and unhygienic handling of food. I've never had a sandwich made with less love!"}
{"text":"I was coming to this location every couple of weeks for a few months. I like(d) Port of Subs and the service was always pretty good. Then I ended up getting food poisoning from this location and was the sickest I've ever been in my whole life. Can't ever do it again! From hell's heart, I stab at thee Port of Subs!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this port of subs another shot and I'm so glad I did. The cleanliness and customer service was GREAT today. The sandwich was the best I have ever had, everything was super fresh. The girl making the sandwich today sneezed a couple of times in her arm and went in the back for something but then came back, washed her hands and put on new gloves. This kind of cleanliness is wonderful to see. Please be consistent like this ALL the time. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!! Completely under staffed and painfully slow. Tea machine is broken. Soda machine out of carbonation. Definitely will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I have now had Port of Subs about 5 times and it is now my favorite sandwich place. Way better than Subway or Quiznos. The bread is always soft and has a great flavor. Kind of reminds me of a place in Texas called Thundercloud Subs (my favorite inTX). They slice the meat and cheese right in front of you, so you know it's fresh. I always get the turkey and provalone. Admittedly they don't have as many selections for veggies than other places, but I only get lettuce and tomato anyway so it doesn't bother me. Only down side for me is that they serve Gold Peak Tea. Yuk! Other than that it's great. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Best subs in town.  Friendly service for a couple of pain in the ass customers like us. Extra this extra that. No problem they say. And don't let me forget about the pickles.  Wow. They are fucking delicious.   I get them on the side as well to munch on.  Best around best in town. Thanks folks we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Well i dont really like subs and didnt know what to get... so I asked this girl, who's name is Tye i guess, what sub she liked the best and she said a #5 with honey mustard and first of all i dont like honey mustard but i said what the hell ill go ahead and try it anyways. i was so happy that she helped me out cuz i was standing there for a while tring to figure it out and she was so nice in suggesting ideas and different things and finally i asked her what she liked and it turned out it was amazing :) im now in love with going to this location just to order the #5 from her! She has amazing customer service, and I can tell she actually cares about the food shes feeding me i sure know my tummy loves it!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Bread is slightly bland. Meats are FAR better than subway. Good selection of veggies and are always pretty fresh. Overall, good chain sub place."}
{"text":"My nephew had a sandwich here and he said it deserves a five star rating. He's a 10 year old and he said \"the food is good'\" no he said \"it's great.\""}
{"text":"Great customer service by the two young guys working. Great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I love port of subs and have been to many in different parts of the valley, this is one is by far the worse. The customer service sucks, I ordered via eat24 and they apparently they dont carry half the chips they others do. And the person in charge was confrontational. Then because I am so close to the store they offered to exchange the chips, excuse me, where I am at isnt the point, you screwed up not me! I need to find out which ones this owner has so I can make sure not to visit his stores again. *update* and for the first time messed up my sandwich. This whole order was a nightmare!"}
{"text":"SInce I discovered Port of Subs I'll never down grade again to Sub Way. They cut the meat right in front of you so you know its fresh! Friendly Staff & the sandwiches always taste great."}
{"text":"I work in the vicinity so yes, I frequent this place quite a bit.  When you're in the area looking for something healthier, this would be the place.  The service is consistently \"good\" - nothing really stands out. Because of it's prime location - the lunch hours can get quite busy. I usually go after 1 - and to be honest - there has not been a long line the past few months I went.  Parking stinks so I usually walk, but if you aren't so lucky - keep in mind their lot is small and they share it with a drive thru Starbucks - you could probably do the math and agree - it STINKS!! Also, this is a tiny location so if dining in is your thing then you may want to skip coming or prepare to wait and be cramped.  While Port-o-Subs isn't my favorite sandwich chain, I frequent this location because I haven't had an issue with quality, price, speed or service."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches. Like, love, love, LOVE them. Such a simple lunch that's always sure to please, and Port of Subs never lets me down. They're always reliable and pretty quick. I love that they slice the cold cuts right in front of me. The cold cuts aren't the best I've ever had, but they're good, and that's enough for me. It's a simple place with a basic selection of sandwiches plus flatbreads, soup, etc. and you can't go wrong. I occasionally find coupons in the Valpak that's mailed to my house."}
{"text":"When it comes to subs there's just nothing not to love here. Freshly sliced cold cuts on very delicious bread, and I love that the sandwich starts out with just the bones and you decide what's on it (instead of having to take things out of it, add things on top of that, etc.). Extra yay for whole wheat roll. I only wish they had cucumbers, LOL.   The sandwich takes seconds to make and the employees are very friendly. Clean and conveniently located.   Great, now I want a sub from here."}
{"text":"This is a very spacious and clean location. The staff are super friendly - way more so than the staff at Valle Verde location.    The downside is that parking is tight in this busy little lot next to hertz and 7-11.  The meat is sliced to order, they are generous with meat and toppings, and they have a whole wheat option. I love that!"}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs for a reliably good sandwich! They have a wheat bread option and the cold cuts are freshly sliced as you order. The prices are decent.   This particular location isn't my favorite. The employees are actually REALLY friendly. But the lunch crowd makes it impossible to get in and out quickly. The restaurant is also really small and cramped. Weekday lunch rush also occasionally means dirty tables. I know it's only because the employees can't be making sandwiches and cleaning at the same time.   I love these sandwiches so I won't let the lunch crowd keep me away. But I think you can order online and it might make the process just a little quicker (you still have to wait on the line of people ordering their sandwiches to get your online order)."}
{"text":"Port of Subs is one of my favorite places for a sandwich and this location rocks. The service is amazing - so quick and friendly. Everyone is smiling! The cold cuts are sliced for you as you order and you get a fair amount on your sandwich. The prices are decent and there's a whole wheat bun. I am hooked!"}
{"text":"Renewed faith in port of subs. Its delicious. Fresh meat and veggies. Reasonably priced. Huge Brownies and cookies. They added panninis to the menu as well."}
{"text":"I had made a complaint and management contacted me immediately. This speaks volumes on the companies behalf. They made it right and I couldn't have asked for more. If you have any concerns or complaints this company will take care of you. Give them a shot, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great service. My family makes weekly trips to this location because of their service. Blue and Vic are the best! Thanks for some great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Port of Subs. I walked in and was greeted right away. I couldn't decide what to get but the employee offered to give me the spill. He did such a good job with his information that I had to try a recommended sandwich .... N.Y Steak, smoked cheddar cheese, chipotle mayo with black olives. It was a VERY GOOD sandwich. I didn't get the guy's name but I'm grateful he helped me tonight!!"}
{"text":"4 star sandwiches, 2 star sides.  Both the potato & macaroni salads were sweet, and that's not my bag, baby.  Ham & turkey on sourdough was good.  The turkey, bacon & avocado on wheat was amazing, but next time it will be turkey, bacon & avocado on sourdough."}
{"text":"The subs are always great, love that everything is thin slices. They always make my sandwich how I want, extra pickles. When they get rushed and the lines get long the staff gets hurried and forgets to be friendly, they get to business and loose the the smiles. But long lines are always a good thing because the food is worth it. If you like sandwiches stop by!"}
{"text":"A-OK is all I can say. This location is always full of teenagers. I think it is a high school hangout. I am cool with high schoolers but would rather not here all details of their life. I just want my sandwich and I want to get out.  One thing I do love is that you can order online and they will have it ready when you get there. This is a great way to avoid high school drama. They are pretty good about making sure the orders are correct.  One thing they should really watch is the bread. It is the vessel for the entire meal. When the bread is stale it ruins the meal. They are also a little chinsy with the toppings. This is supposed to be a sub sandwich, bursting with fresh veggies and meat. I hate when you have to ask for more lettuce and they look like they will kill you.   Maybe it is a high school thing. They are always in a rush to get you through because they usually have friends in the line right behind."}
{"text":"Manager was a doll got the number 1 she made it her way and boy was it incredible. Love when people care and are involved. Will come back to this location when in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"I was in town and felt like having a nice sub sandwich. Reviews looked good so I stoped in for lunch.  This place is located inside of another store. I went and ordered a sandwich and then noticed the sitting area was like a homeless shelter. Several of the tables were taken up by suitcases and a guitar. The homeless at the tables were not eating but I guess management just lets them hang out.  The smell was horrible. Stay away from this place unless they clean it up. Sorry I stopped in."}
{"text":"so this place is awesome for vegetarians! I went in for the first time, ordered the veggie sandwich...now they slice their meat and cheese on the same cutting machine which i did not realize at first. But since I ordered the veggie, they offered to clean the slicer before cutting the cheese for my sandwich..um, yes please do!  then they loaded up the veggies on the sandwich and it was amazing!! i love that they have macaroni salad as a side as well. The GM was working as well and he was super friendly. I've already gone back in since because the customer service was so outstanding and the food tastes so great!! oh! and unlike the subway just across the street, this place doesn't charge vegetarians extra $$ for putting avocado on their sandwich!! win-win!"}
{"text":"Super yummy sandwiches! And sooo happy that they do Uber Eats. I ordered a #1 combo and it was very yummy. I'd say it was even better than subway! Here are plenty of options to put on your sandwich and I was able to clearly tell that the ingredients were fresh! My sandwich was not soggy by the time it arrived at my home (which I was expecting) the bread was not too thick and the bread-ingredient proportion was on point! And I was *super* excited to see that sourdough bread was an option! I will definitely be returning or ordering!"}
{"text":"The hours suck. Every time I pull up to the parking lot they're closed. Only open 4 hours on Sunday's ?! Wtf is that"}
{"text":"So unprofessional....I called at 9:15 and asked if they would be open until ten and they said yes. I arrived at 9:50 on the dot but the sign was turned off. I could see the two workers inside so I knocked on the door and they actually crouched behind the counter to hide like children. I knocked again and motioned that I had called . They pretty much just giggled and then shrugged me off totally. I could have gone to a number of other places but since they mostly all close by ten in my area as well I ended up stranded with no other options all because I had wanted to give my business here. I wont make the same mistake again."}
{"text":"I LOVE Port of Subs even more now than ever before!! They have cucumbers and spinach now AND they are putting in the super duper coke machine!! They also said they will have flatbread soon..about time they stepped up their game! They are much fresher than Subway and offer medium 8\" sandwich. This location at S. decatur and the 2-15 is always friendly, clean and informative!! I would have taken a picture of our roast beef and smokey cheddar sandwich....but its gone!"}
{"text":"First time here; the food was great and the service was good. No complaints, we'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"Everytime  im in the area, I stop by this Port of Subs. Im greeted by smiling employees , ChaQuille & Kyleen. Everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Friendly young lady working behind the counter. My first experience with POS. Not bad, 3 stars about sums it up."}
{"text":"This location has recently completed a remodel. Looks Great!  Extremely clean, neat organized."}
{"text":"These guys are what customer service should be. Not only are they polite and fun, but they make every effort to right a wrong situation. The restaurant is clean and they are never out of stock of ingredients or crisps.  Come by and say hi! And order a sandwich while you're there."}
{"text":"I love Port Of Subs but this location definitely let me down. When we got there it took them about five minutes to come out to greet us & take our order. Once we started ordering the young man kept messing up our orders it was to the point where we had to tell him about seven times what we wanted on our sub. When he finally was done making our subs correctly we decided to eat there, well as we began eating I noticed the two workers were mumbling and the young man was basically giving us the evil eye as he gossiped away with his coworker. Who at the moment was cleaning or should I say sanitizing the slicing machine and in that time about 4 different customers walked out due to this, I'm not sure how the owner is running this place but they definitely need to take a closer look into who they're hiring to run their business."}
{"text":"This Port of Subs is definitely 5-stars. They are super-fast and have the best service. You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches, but do yourself a favor and get an 8 inch #1 on sourdough. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Port of subs never lets me down excellent subs,tasty bread,fresh vegetables,good jalapeños,good deal overall,good price. The staff was very friendly here very helpful."}
{"text":"First time having port of subs ever. It was much better than the leading competitor. Friendly staff, good atmosphere, fresh ingredients. My son is vegetarian and when I ordered his sandwich they cleaned the machine to slice the cheese. :)"}
{"text":"Front doors are very heavy to open especially if you have old people using canes walkers or wheelchairs. They have a huge menu board of alot if sandwiches. I ordered medium turkey cheese. The girl making the sandwiches has shoulder length hair Not wearing a,hair net, the vents were blowing her hair all over the food. The lettuce is welted brown, the tomatoes are freezer burnt,,,,This So called manager running the cash register didnt address this to her at all or did they seem like he cares about the foid being served!!!!! I'm just a picky bitch when it comes to my food and money, sorry but there are health rules you go by working in the food industry here in Las vegas nv. Called hair nets and gloves use it!!!! Also they are way over priced for a shit ty tasting sandwich. Stick to cappriotis or a deli. Good kuck. Last time I will be in there too!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh tasting subs...they go the extra mile by shaving the meats and cheeses to order...Worth driving the extra distance in my opinion...the prices are a bit high yes...s mentioned in other reviews....and their potato salad sucks...  Other than that, staff could be friendlier and that's my only pet peeve about the place...Nobody smiles, nobody cares..they just want your money....It's really a turnoff....  Quality food plus service with an attitude costs you two stars. There's  no reason for you to behave like that with your customers as there are plenty of competition in the area. Drop the attitudes and I'll be back more often and maybe change my rating.....yes feeling a little bitter about my experience there."}
{"text":"The owner is usually in when we visit this place. He is always super nice and the staff is really great. Very happy to have a great port of subs near my house!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Las Vegas and found this great sub shop. The service is good and food is very delicious. My wife and I have come back here many times as we enjoy their good sandwiches. Thank you."}
{"text":"Best location in town!   Most friendly staff! They're helpful, nice and makes great sandwiches.   I come in at least twice a week for my boss and they've memorized his order by now but always double check with me before making it!   The sandwiches are made so good, I am spoiled at this location. When I go to other locations expecting my sandwich's be made the same, I'm disappointed.   The onions are cut perfect, nice and thin.   It's always so clean inside though I don't stay often.  They've got a rewards program, ummmm yes please!!"}
{"text":"My sub had no tomato no cheese no lettuce just tuna it was the blandist sub  ever had in my life"}
{"text":"Fresh bread and veggies, and the meat sliced to order. Everything was delicious including macaroni salad. Josh was entertaining and delivered great service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Extremely slow! I got a turkey and provolone on wheat toasted and, by the time I got my sandwich is was cold...there's a reason I ordered it toasted. We must of waited in line for at least 25 minutes and there were only 4 people a head of us. There were two people working, the ladies that started the sandwich seemed very unhappy. Then while we sat down to eat our sandwiches the two employees were fighting while making sandwiches...very unprofessional. Would not go back here again."}
{"text":"Port of Subs at this location has maintained the quality my fiancé and I are used to experiencing.  However, the employees have serious attitude problems that need to be dealt with by a manager or corporate. The girl who made our sandwich had an attitude the entire time she was preparing it. Once she asked us about the condiments we would like on the sandwich, we told her what they would be, her response was, \"Are you serious?\" flabbergasted, for some reason I couldn't tell you about.  Then, we stood and watched her prepare the sandwich (because wtf else do you do?), she got pissed off we were standing there and made us pay before we even got the sandwich. If you don't want people to watch what you do to their food, work somewhere else.  So, she asks us would we like onions, tomatoes, and pickles on the sandwich. Both me and my fiancé agreed, yes. So he told her that. He was loud enough to be heard. But she turns to me and says, \"Did you not hear me or?\"  Will not be returning to this location period. No wonder why they have a \"hiring now\" sign taped to the door."}
{"text":"Best Port Of Subs in town. Best sandwiches and best experience. Grant is/was, by far, the best at making my usual and even had my friend's order memorized when we'd step in. He made the experience but everything else about the store made this the best location too. Everything was above all the others."}
{"text":"This sub shop is close to work so I get to eat here often.  I usually get a salad. They will make any sandwich into a salad for you if you are into low carb diets.  They slice the meat right in front of you after you place the order.  You then get to customize your sandwich or salad the way you like.  You can even pick romaine or shredded lettuce for the salad.  Portion size is good and a salad is around $8."}
{"text":"Meh it was OK. They do slice the sandwich meat in front of you and the whole wheat bread was surprisingly good, but in terms of options on toppings they can't hold a candle to Subway.  They have like the basics: pickle, lettuce, tomato, onion, and some mayo/mustard concoction already mixed together [not sure of the ratio of mayo to mustard but it looked so interesting I skipped it].  Service was fast, place was clean, was more expensive then Subway... was decent enough for a sandwich I guess, but not overly exciting."}
{"text":"Dylan was our friendly sandwich maker! What a cute kid he is!! Very friendly and greeted us with a big smile, and that is always a nice thing.  We ordered 3 large sandwiches that were made to perfection.  The staff is always really nice, food always fresh and overall a pretty clean place.  This is our go-to sandwich place since we discovered it. We just love it here!"}
{"text":"I only continue to go to this location for the sandwiches, as the customer service is terrible. The last 2-3 times I've been in I have been ignored, or not treated as a priority as a customer. I understand that coworkers converse, but when there is only one customer, the conversations should be limited and focus should be on the person spending money. Also, each time I go in, the manager is the one that rings me up, and also ignores me most of the time I am there. Customer service can greatly be improved, although I still love their sandwiches."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch and I wasn't impressed at all.  I heard that the food was good but I've had better subs almost anywhere.  They have very limited toppings.  I wish I had gone to Mr. Goodcents down the street much better quality subs."}
{"text":"Every time is perfect. I only get the turkey and cheese large and it's awesome. Everything is freshly sliced and very fresh. The inside of the restaurant is clean and comfortable for lunch."}
{"text":"My go to sandwich was okay the Number 5 on White Bread. Still better in opinion than Subway and Jimmy John's. There chips selection is limited compared to most other sandwich joints, but more than Jimmy Johns. The meats and cheese were great as usual, but the veggies seemed a bit limp and lacking the crunch factor."}
{"text":"I really like the owners a lot. They are really friendly and helpful but I agree with another yelper about the strictness. You do have to pay for extra stuff. Also, they do not accept franchise coupons, which is odd. However, they do have a sign saying so."}
{"text":"Although this place is very similar to Subway, I think it's better. I liked the ciabatta bread so much better than a hard sub roll offered by their competitors. It seemed a bit pricey for a sub shop, though. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this location at least once a week when I lived out here. Earning free sandwiches was a regular thing!   The shop is always clean when I come in and never too packed. Today's visit was in and out. The staff was extremely nice here today and has always been when I come here.  My only complaint, and this is a vegetarian complaint so it might not hold true to most, but I wish they didn't slice my cheese on the same slicer they slice their meat. But, I am aware of this, and could simply stop coming here. Actually it's one of the main reasons I typically choose Subway over them.  In the end, their sandwiches are always fresh and flavorful. I have been to the one closest to me now here and there on Hualapai and Flamingo and the same story is there. Consistency is key and they seem to have it down."}
{"text":"Not bad.  I needed somewhere close to work to eat lunch at and I saw this place.  Decided that I would give it a try.  I ordered a medium (8 inch ) #7 which is roast beef and provolone.   That and a small Coke came out to $8.50.  They slice the meats once you order your sandwich.  Bread was good...soft yet sturdy.  It tasted good.  No better or worse than other chainish sub shops.  If I'm ever craving a sub and am pressed for time, I know where to go.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"The service wasn't bad, but the sandwiches we're kinda disappointing. We both got the #8 turkey and provolone on sourdough and the bread was too thick, hard and unflavorful. Maybe they would have been better if we ordered them toasted, but I was craving a cold sub. We left feeling pretty unsatisfied and I'm still hungry. The chocolate chip cookie kinda tasted like a powdered donut at first but the middle of it was pretty good. I wouldnt go back, I prefer jimmy John's or even Potbelly's"}
{"text":"Shot out to the owner and employees at Port of Subs on Pecos and Dessert Inn in Las Vegas! I went there today for lunch with my boyfriend. We dined in and I hung my purse on the chair as we ate. The food was great! We left and not too long after, I got a Facebook message from the owner letting me know that I left my purse there. I called the store and spoke to the owner who was super professional and I told him I'd be on my way. I got there and the owner gave me my purse. I'm so grateful not only for getting my purse back just the way left if, but also for their excellent customer service and great food! I recommend this particular Port of Subs to all my friends in the area!   Port of Subs 2833 E. Desert Inn, #3, Las Vegas, NV 89121 (702) 894-9588  https://goo.gl/maps/emsLvRuTvHx"}
{"text":"Not sure what is up with the low reviews.  I have had good experiences here.  I usually order the #8 turkey and provolone.  I like a lot of mayo, and they always accommodate.  The customer service has been great for me.  I came in once just at closing, and they waved me in.  Good sandwich shop.  Quick and easy."}
{"text":"I had my meal on the premises while with a friend (I usually take it home) and it was a pretty decent experience.  The store is clean and the staff are so friendly they make you feel right at home.  Thanks, PoS!"}
{"text":"These guys don't deliver. Tried to order once from these chaps when I found them on the store locator, but found that my order was placed outside delivery hours so it was a no-go. Tried again at another time, only to find out they actually no longer offer delivery from this location at all, even though the Port of Subs website lists them as doing so. I eventually managed to contact another location on Badura south of the 215 Beltway that delivers to my area (off of Rainbow & Russell, ironically four or so blocks from this location) that was friendly and professional. If you want a sandwich delivered with a minimum of fuss, contact them instead. Don't bother with the Rainbow location."}
{"text":"They don't deliver. Well, that may not be true--when I called to try and place an order for delivery, she asked if it was a catering order. Unlike the South Rainbow location, which the Port of Subs website says offers delivery but in fact does not, this location is listed on the website as offering delivery with a $50 minimum order. Which makes it sound more akin to just catering orders, but given the fact that a lot of other reviewers have indicated skimpy portioning practices and scarcity of included napkins, one can draw some conclusions about the location and its service as a whole. The lady seemed friendly enough for somebody who wasn't actually really apologetic about the fact their location won't deliver unless (possibly) you pony up some serious dough for sandwich fixins, but after I called the location down south on Badura and had not only a great sandwich delivered to my location (which no other Port of Subs in the area would do) but a very pleasant time talking to the attendant who double-checked my order and ensured I knew about any prospective delays, menu options or pricings, I won't likely stop by this location because let's face it--there's a better one that brings the sandwich *to me*."}
{"text":"Woefully, this location no longer offers delivery, which is the sole reason I patronized them previously. Well, that is to say that they don't offer delivery *directly*; they work through a couple of delivery services, apparently, so you can still get your sandwich at home. The problem with third-party services, depending on which ones they are, is that restaurants often have slightly different pricing for delivery orders, it takes longer for processing, pickup and delivery, and there's an extra fee tracked on by the outfit that does it. It's also less convenient. I understand that if a location is understaffed, or just can't make having delivery feasible, then it's not really something within their control to provide. The food is still pretty good here, but it seems silly to me to order a sandwich through a delivery service when I could instead order a steak or a plate of pasta from sit-down restaurants that wouldn't feature delivery normally, which is usually why I use delivery services in the first place."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich spot in town. Always friendly staff, great tasting sandwich, made to order. Great place to get some lunch before chillaxin at the pool. Port of subs has some quality food at a great price."}
{"text":"The subs are always fantastic, the bread is soft and fresh.  Their frequent buyer program is also a plus.  I rack up so many free subs in very little time.  The people behind the counter are always friendly and quick to fill your order.  I've been going here for years and have never been disappointed. If you have other shopping to take care of after you are finished eating, there are a lot of stores within easy walking distance."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and simple.   Pros: freshly slices meats and cheeses, fresh veggies, and great bread make for excellent sandwiches   Cons: unfriendly service, semi-pricey depending on your order, extremely skimpy on the premium sandwich additions that you pay extra for (bacon, avocado, etc.)  If you don't mind the service being ho-hum and you avoid getting the premium additions, this is a decent sandwich shop."}
{"text":"So friendly staff Portia was excellent  Food was delicious also  Great location  Clean"}
{"text":"I always enjoy a good Port of Sub Sandwich.    These folks are friendly and I've never had a bad experience. For vegetarians, they will offer to wipe down the cutting machine for the cheese on your sandwich (as it is used for deli meat as well). They are also good about changing gloves.  Very sanitary as I have been grossed out at other sub places for cross contamination in front of my very eyes!"}
{"text":"Amazingly enough, I hadn't tried this chain since I've lived in Vegas for awhile until recently.  When I want a quick sub from subway, I literally only get one thing (because I hate everything else) - the Tuna on wheat with lots of extra veggies.  Subway's tuna is like crack, I have no idea what they put in it other than some cheap tuna and mayo, and I love it on occasion.  I wanted to try this as something different, as they claimed they used better quality ingredients.  It was the worst tuna sandwich I have ever had.  Just completely flavorless.  I am giving this place one extra star because of the steak sandwich I got for my husband, he said it was far and away much better quality steak than Subway or Quiznos (as Katie S has attested).  So if that's the kind of sub you like, you might be happy.  However, for me, I'm not going to touch this place at all."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches. Prefer the hot grilled sandwiches. Good amount of meats. Service is sometimes slower at lunch time than you would expect for the number of employees working, though. It's close to work, so always part of the rotation for lunch time."}
{"text":"Love port of subs. My husband goes to this location often and they always remember his order and are so friendly. Delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"Here is the.fast food place that is one of the worst I've ever been to. I ordered a sandwich and the meat when applied to the sandwich was less than 1/8\" applied on two layers. When I asked for extra heavy amounts of onions and tomatoes the clerk put on 6thinly sliced rings of when I said that I wanted more onion he just put on another 6 rings. The same was true with the tomatoes they must cut them with a laser they were so thin that you could see thru them.  This sandwich cost me $7.95 plus tax.   I can go about 400 yard to a SUBWAY and get a sandwich with a good deal more meat and the onions and tomatoes are as I requested - plenty full with no special request need just saying make then extra large servings. My sandwich will cost the same and the servers will just ask is that enough on the vegetables."}
{"text":"So glad this location is open! Extremely neat, clean place and the employees were very courteous and helpful!"}
{"text":"The food at this port of subs is so fresh, I always get avocado and it is consistently ripe!(: THe food never disappoints although... I've never experienced good customer service here and I visit all the time. The girls who work here, specifically the short brunette are rude and seem so unhappy. It seriously feels like they don't want to be there which makes me not want to either. This store is lucky it has amazing food otherwise I would never had come back due to the terrible service."}
{"text":"I would have given a higher score but due to the heavier set blonde with the blue tooth head set she wasn't pleasant and just kinda talked to who ever doesn't focus on the task at hand and was honestly rude towards the coworker this is my second time to a port of sub and food is pretty decent. Cleanliness of the store was so so. And men's restroom is broken and the women's is poor lit. So if it was a cleaner store with good employee service I would be giving 4-5 stars"}
{"text":"Today someone came into the place I work to advertise and brought in a catering menu, regular menu, and COUPONS.  Who doesn't love coupons!?  Oh and she also brought a container of four little sample sandwiches.  They were sooo delicious and tasted very fresh!  I will definitely be stopping in on my lunch break one of these days."}
{"text":"Port of Subs over Subway any day.  Favorite sandwich place and crave their sandwiches from time to time.  This location is very clean and fast.  Highly recommend whenever you're in the mood for a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Just got sandwiches there again last night!  Hubby got the #18 and I got a 14 with spinach, pickles, cucumbers, olives, lettuce and tomato!  Both of our sandwiches were great and we are always made to feel welcome.  Food is fresh and delicious and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"Awesome store! I'm an avid Port of Subs fan and this is by far the best location I've been to. They always clean the slicer when I order a veggie sandwich, no other store has ever offered to do this. They have two lines so service is always quick even during the lunch hour. The staff is impressive, sandwiches are always accurate, neat, and made quick. A fantastic place to have a meal hands down!"}
{"text":"Final nail in the coffin today. On my rewards card I have a free sandwich. Had sandwich made and then was informed the program for rewards is in the process of changing and I could not use it for the free sandwich. Ok I get it, how about honoring my free sandwich I have been saving up points for a year and a half for. You could see it in the computer it was there. I would be fine if I could understand why, but I got a few different answers. If you want to clear this up then contact me. Just don't stab your customers in the back. Maybe put a sign on the door that says not honoring rewards cards."}
{"text":"Excellent service! The food is always fresh. The staff is very friendly and great with kids! We highly recommend this store."}
{"text":"I now prefer Port O Subs over Subway.  The food just seems to taste better.  I use this location when I am at home and never had any problems walking in and getting my food fast.  Sometimes there is a line when its around lunch time but they are quick to make up what I want.  Everytime I walk in they always say hello and don't keep you waiting if your the only one there.    Location nice and parking is easy since its a little further down from the grocery store so you can usually find a spot up front."}
{"text":"Decided to get port of subs instead of fast food. I came in around 8:25 PM. That employees seemed a little irritated. And they said they were closing soon. Which they close at 9 PM. I was prepared to give them a big Tip For coming so close to closing time. But the lady who is checking us out was very rude. My card was having a chip malfunction issue. I asked her to try It again but gave me a dirty look. So I jus decided to give her cash. I gave her $30.25 When the bill was $27.12. She gave me $.13 back but never gave me the $3. I asked her if she was going to give me the rest of my change. She said she already gave it to me which she didn't. I checked my wallet to be sure. I had no $1 bills in my wallet just $20's and $5's. I just came from working a 10 hour day I didn't feel like arguing over $3. I will definitely never be back at this location!"}
{"text":"Yummm...  Good alternative to Subway. I get tired of the dry wheat bread at other places.  They've got a bunch of sandwiches, and the meats & cheeses are always sliced fresh in front of you. (So nothing that's been sitting around for a while.)  They've got a delicious \"Mix\" spread - - which is mayo and mustard. And a variety of \"value\" sandwiches... starting at just over $3.00.   Staff is friendly.. and quick service. :)"}
{"text":"This location is always clean, friendly, and fast! Everything I would want a restaurant to be! I went in 10 min till closing and those 2 girls were so sweet letting me take my time, recommending sandwiches. They even turned the grill back on for me so I could toast my sub. My #5 was so delicious I'll be back again tomorrow night"}
{"text":"Pretty average subs.  It's more expensive than Subway and didn't taste much better in my opinion.  I did notice they slice their own meats and cheese, so I do think the ingredients are a bit fresher.   However, I didn't really taste the difference.  Pft.  Eh."}
{"text":"Great service especially due to the manager Rigo. Super nice guy. Always smiling making you feel welcome and running a smooth and efficient  store. Oh, the sandwiches are great too."}
{"text":"There is a 10% off check in special. When I showed the cashier she knew nothing about it. They called over a man that maybe was the owner/manager and he said he had never seen it and that they do not accept this discount. He said I must be at the wrong location, I showed him the address and it was correct. He gave me the discount but said they normally do not."}
{"text":"A tale of two stores . . .   A couple reviews ago, I wrote about one Port of Subs store I will not go back to. They did attempt to contact me but offered nothing in incentives or compensation or even attempt to explain how things would be different the next time I visit that store.    However, with *this* store it is the complete opposite!  This Port of Subs location is closest to where I live, located on the southeast corner of Flamingo & Durango sharing the convenience store & gas station there. Both places are very clean and well kept. And both places have very nice and cordial staff who always greet you with a smile.  I probably order from this store about 1-2 times per week. Times vary from afternoon to evenings to just about closing time. The staff is incredibly friendly and always smiling. Kudos to management for their training and hiring quality staff. One staff member, Josh, usually is there whenever I come in. Very friendly and nice. One time I came in and there were about five customers in front of me in line. Josh appeared to be the only one there. He displayed the type of hustle I rarely see nowadays and was able to knock out the line including me, efficiently and quickly, while still maintaining a professional and friendly attitude. I was very impressed.  Other staff here have been just as nice and friendly. Combined with the fact I love the sandwiches already, make for a very pleasant experience. I don't know if this is a franchise or corporate owned store but I commend the management for assembling and running such an efficient and friendly shop whenever I have set foot here. I will continue to be a repeat customer at this location. Job well done!!"}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs and their sandwiches. However, I do not like nor will I recommend *this* particular location. Here is my experience.  I decided to give this place another try after my previous customer service experience here a few weeks ago was not good. The first time around, I ordered by number, like I do at a couple other Port of Subs locations here in town. I asked for a #16. The guy behind the counter then started cutting meat of a different sandwich. When I told him I asked for a #16, he became argumentative and replied, \"No, you asked for #18.\" I'm pretty sure I asked for a #16 but did not want to argue with him. He then said he could switch to the #16 but his body language and demeanor indicated he would not be happy. I apologized for the miscommunication and told him to finish making the #18. He replied with an obligatory tone, \"Are you sure?\" I replied, \"You're good. Just finish making the sandwich. Now, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and dismissed it as it was about 10 minutes to closing time. He probably wasn't having the best day, and I just wanted my sandwich and go.   This evening, I was running a little late for work and decided to give this place another try. As I pulled up, I looked through the store window and noticed it was the same person I dealt with the last time I was here, who was behind the counter. I double checked to make sure their place was still open. I had 15 minutes before they closed at 9:00pm. I mumbled to myself as I got out of my car, \"Please, no issues.\" As soon as I walked in the door, the guy looks at me with the same look one would have when being caught between a rock and a hard place and said, \"Uh, . . . we just cleaned up everything . . .\" I immediately did a 180 turn and walked out without saying a word.  I work in customer service and have also been a customer service manager. Therefore, my expectations for people working in customer service are a little higher than some. I also used to work in food service so I know what it's like when customers (especially groups of 3 or more) come in during the last few minutes just before closing time, so I can empathize with the workers, and normally try to avoid being *that* customer. However, in this particular situation, I was a party of one and it was 15 minutes before they closed.  Unacceptable and poor customer service. I will avoid this particular location."}
{"text":"The guy who helped me made very generous sandwiches. He even offered a suggestion to save me a buck when checking out.  I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"The workers here did absolutely nothing to make the customer happy when there was a problem.  I hope they enjoyed the sandwiches that I left on the counter when I walked out."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were great but I don't think there cleanliness is up to par. We got a soda and drank all the soda and took the top off to eat the ice and there was some mold/dirt in the ice"}
{"text":"We ordered a platter for superbowl for a 12:30pm pick up time the next day. We happened to get there about 12pm, since we were already in the area, we just thought we would see if they we ready. They happened to be finishing up our platter when we walked in. I had already paid for it online, so it just required me picking it up. The gentleman instead walked it out to my car for me, talk about great customer service! I have been to this location several times, and always have a positive experience. The online ordering is also super convenient."}
{"text":"I went to Port of Subs for the first time in 5 years. It was horrible, there was hardly any meat on the sandwich and the bread was very dry. I ordered a ham/turkey sub, there were like two slices of each on the sandwich. Subway is a far better option than this location."}
{"text":"Use to be really good and consistent. Past three time visited entirely new staff that seem to be short handed and frazzled. It use to be clean but two out of three times visited the equipment was dirty. The ingredients were not fresh. Is lettuce suppose to be brown? Got home and could not finish the sandwich the bread was stale. I'm definitely not returning"}
{"text":"This place is SUPER close to my work and I've stopped in at least 5 times, so I feel I have experienced the basic gist of the place.  Pros:  -sourdough bread (my fave) -fresh sliced meat and cheese -doesn't have that yucky \"subway smell\" that sticks to your clothes  Cons: -the meat and cheese are no better than any other place -WAY sub-par toppings..have your pick between wilted iceberg and soggy tomatoes, basically -they flat out just ask you to tip them  You're making me a frickin' sandwich, this is basically no different than Subway, where no one would ever think to tip. You have a clearly visible tip jar on the counter, so I know I can tip if I want. Why ask me to tip you? It's seriously awkward and unprofessional. (No tip wank intended, I've done food service, waitressing, etc. I tip where appropriate.)  Tonight I went out and bought mayo, sourdough bread and some salami....I will make a way better #12 myself, thankyouverymuch."}
{"text":"I went here because of a coworkers recommendation and was not impressed. The amount of meat and toppings was minuscule compared to the thick bread. All the ingredients were good but there wasn't enough. It's probably pretty good if you get the double meat and cheese options, otherwise it's 90% bread."}
{"text":"The customer service I received with Jaymie at this Port a Sub location was exceptional! I went there looking for a Gift Card. They were out, but that didn't stop her from finding a previous used Gift card with .11c on it. (The Card it self looked new!) She said she could just reload the card with any amount! Now this is someone that actually takes time to figure out a solution & presents options, in stead of taking the easy way and saying....Sorry we don't have any gift cards & letting a customer walk out! I really appreciated the effort!! So I will be visiting that store again! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Usually I love coming to this port of subs. The works are always nice and helpful with the menu which is why I gave two stars.    But I had just come at 6:54 today - Sunday 5/15- to get a sandwich ((I know they close at 7)) and as I was walking up the worker had locked the door right in front of me (I don't if she saw me but still) . I didn't appreciate this at all considering they minutes before they had actually closed."}
{"text":"They never open the second register during the lunch rush, and if you call in or place your order online, you'll still end up waiting. They get about 45 mins to fix a sandwich and can't even do that. My lunch break was already over by the time i got out of there. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Why get a sandwich when you can get a wrap? I haven't been to port of subs in a looong looong time!  Not much has changed.  They still slice everything fresh right in front of you and it's still delicious.    I came to this particular store today a little bit after lunch so I didn't have to wait.  The service was extremely fast and friendly so I don't think I would have had to wait long if it was busy. I got the turkey and bacon ranch wrap and had them load it up with veggies and grill it.  Delish!! However,  I did get a medium Ice Tea, but it didn't taste right to me.  Almost like the flavors in the machine may have gotten mixed up.  Other than that, everything else was good.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Average. Sure the place could be cleaner. The owner could be nicer to his employees. But they make sandwiches and smoothies, nothing really to write home about.... Even the best sub or smoothie in the world would be nothing to go crazy about. Point is, it's a great location. With solid good food"}
{"text":"Love this port of subs!!! Always get a number 5 on wheat with mayo mustard extra lettuce extra pickles and salt pepper and vinegar! Yumm!!!! The Italian is also very good!! ( number 1)"}
{"text":"LOVE Port of Subs!  My favorite sub chain.  I just wish they were more conveniently located."}
{"text":"This port of subs is great! I went in at 11:30am for lunch and they had my sandwich made and rang me up in the matter of minutes. They're bread was also ultra soft. Super friendly staff. This is the best port of subs I've been to based on their timeliness and friendliness."}
{"text":"My order was messed up  But the owner talked to me personally and cleared everything up. Amazing service on his part. Thank you very much! Good food regardless."}
{"text":"This is a fine and dandy sandwich shop which is part of a chain.  The quality of bread is high, generally tasting quite fresh and delicious.  The white bread, in my opinion, is definitely yummier than the wheat.  The tuna is also better than the vegetarian.  (Also just my opinion.)  The mustard/mayo sauce is tangy and delightful but a bit overpowering when combined with the extremely dill-y pickle slices.  Not too crowded, this place serves a great quick lunch.  However, it's no match for its local competitors, as far as this gal's concerned.  It'll do when I'm in that shopping plaza, but otherwise, I'll choose Steve's Crazy Subs any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Love port of subs! Wish they offered \"toasted subs\"... they don't even ask? Fresh sliced meats & cheeses  yum"}
{"text":"I have been here before, and its always amazing. Tonight, I was going into the store for other reasons, But, the man I see on the corner of Flamngo/koval got my attention. He has been sitting there for at least 6months. I stopped to say hello and asked if he was hungry? Yes he said. He said he liked tuna fish. The girl at the counter was awesome! She made him a kick-ass sub!  Port O Subs, you have amazing employees! Thank you"}
{"text":"This location was the worst port of Subs it was The worst i have ever been to they had bread that didn't get fully cooked and was a little over an inch wide and I asked them to give me new bread and they refused and said they would be wasting the bread I told them they shouldn't of been serving in the first place and they should've thrown it away it was a bad batch the lady refused don't ever go to this location. This is also the only location that has refused to make a child's meal a meatball sandwich."}
{"text":"I come from Reno where there is almost always a line when you go to a Port of Subs. I've grown up eating their sandwiches and have loved them all. When I moved to Vegas I expected the same great food. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. The food just doesn't seem as fresh and the employees just don't make the food to the standard I expect.   Fast forward a bit, I finally found a good Port of Subs in Vegas! While the sandwiches haven't been as great as I remember them in Reno, they are the best I've had in the Vegas area. The food is much fresher at this location than I've had at others near by. While I won't be going once a week like I did in Reno, I'm glad I found a quality Port of subs to satisfy my random cravings!   Also try their cookies, especially if they were made that day. You can check the sticker on the back. When they are fresh, some of the best cookies I've ever had!"}
{"text":"What is the difference between Port of Subs and Subway?  I don't know, they were pretty similar in pretty much every way.  From the bread, amount of meat, the way they package it, to the price point, they're basically one and the same.  I had a roast beef and provolone sub, which was as standard as any other.  Okay, different type of cheese and their sizes were in different varieties, but otherwise... Service was good, restaurant was clean so no complaints, but there's just nothing that stands out for me to want to come back.  I will since it's next to my work, on those days I need to git.  Ho hum."}
{"text":"I come to this location for Miguel. As a guy who works in retail, I have an utmost appreciation for someone who can start and maintain a conversation with a stranger and not make thing awkward. If I just wanted robot customer service I'd go through a competitors drive through. But he is great at breaking the mold. Service is always quick, food is always good. I love coming here. I actually debated with my wife about me coming here instead of her, because I love the atmosphere!  In short, the food is great. The people are the best."}
{"text":"Very clean with friendly and efficient staff! If your looking for a semi-healthy option with little time.. This is the winner. No complaints :)"}
{"text":"Great fresh food always quick and delicious... I come here when I want a great sandwich...  They have the best deal as well...  10.99 for a 2ft sandwich with purchase of large drink!"}
{"text":"You can get a really delicious, fresh, low cal, turkey-bacon-ranch wrapped in lettuce or wheat!  The line moves fast.  The prices are reasonable.  Signed, sealed, delivered.  What more do you really need or want from a lunch option?"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience with the staff or the food here.  I just wish they were more generous with the meat on their subs.  Apart from that, it is a really good place."}
{"text":"The service was okay, but the quality of the sandwich was really lacking. The only vegetarian option they have is a veggie sandwich with so much cheese on it I thought I might have a heart attack upon consuming it. The avocado spread tasted someone told and the bread was stale and dry. Port of subs used to be my favorite sandwich chain and now I'm not sure if I will continue eating there at all because everyone I've been to over the last few years when I come home to visit, seems to really suck."}
{"text":"Came in today and felt very welcomed. Great service, the guy who made my sandwich had great customer service. Made conversation the entire time. Normally I go to the store on green valley but after this experience I'll be back for sure.   Thanks so much for a memorable experience."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place and I wasn't disappointed. I had a Chipotle Chicken Sandwich (which I think was a special item on the menu) and Broccoli Cheese Soup. I love how this place slices their meats and cheeses right when you order. It makes this place stand out from any other chain sandwich place. The ingredients here taste fresher. The soup had good sizes of broccoli and it wasn't salty. It was perfect. No need to add anything. The soup was self served and I got a refill but I'm not sure if you're not supposed to. No one stopped me. My meal was SOOOOOOOOO YUMMY!!! I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I generally use yelp to discover new places that have good reviews. I'm actually writing one of my first reviews because of how disappointed I am. I love port of subs but I really hate this location. I came in today to get a sandwich which seriously had barely any meat on it. Compared to the price I was not pleased at all. I bought a large #18 to share with my friend and the sandwich was all lettuce. I'm not normally one to complain because I am a hairdresser and I understand the struggle of having customers that you cannot please no matter what you do. But this was seriously displeasing. I will keep my business at the village square port of subs in summerlin. Where they don't jip you on meat just because they're too busy talking to their coworker."}
{"text":"After reading so many negative reviews about this place, I feel it is my duty to set the record straight. Port of subs is without a doubt, my favorite sandwich spot. Subway could learn some things from these folks....like....SOFT BREAD and FRESH MEAT. Every sandwich that I get here tastes incredible and is made with fresh ingredients. For me, the bread makes a sandwich and the bread that they use is always super soft and delicious. They have this mix of mayo and mustard that is perfect on a sandwich and compliments all of the meat and veggies.   All of the workers here have been very friendly, given my son free cookies once and been very gracious to us. They even deliver and said that they would deliver to us in Casa Grande. I haven't attempted to call their bluff but the fact that the manager said that they would is crazy awesome.   I had never tried the meatball sandwich there and the manager brought me one to try just cause I had mentioned that I was curious. That's the kind of service that I love and that brings customers back.   This is THE best place to get a sandwich. My wife and I both love this place. BUILD ONE IN CASA GRANDE! I can't take any more subway or jimmy johns!"}
{"text":"I should have known better. You know how some places just give off a vibe that it is filthy even though it looks alright on the surface, this is one of them. Should have left right away, now me and my girlfriend both have FOOD POISONING. Stay away."}
{"text":"I've been to other Port of Subs before and this one just underwhelms a bit.  The sitting area isn't particularly clean.  The sandwich-making area was messy as well.  The team working was not great -- to be fair, one guy was engaged, but everyone else seemed a bit, well, \"out to lunch.\"    Compounding this the drink machine was out of ice and they wouldn't tell you until AFTER you ordered and then they'd say, \"you can have a bottled drink instead if you want.\"  But they didn't have bottled unsweetened, ice tea.  Next time, I try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but did an online order and they didn't actually have a few of the items we were allowed to order online -- notably the BLT Griller because they were out of bacon?  Out of bacon?  How does that happen.  So I quick pick-up for an online order turned into a live re-order and kind of defeated the whole  point.  The Italian sandwich was pretty good."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs and I was about to stop at nasty Wendy's when I saw them across the street, I immediately changed direction. Some times a good sandwich is needed. Sliced cheese and meat, mixed mayo & mustard....UM YES! The gentleman that made it and rang me up was kind and did a great job."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot! The food is always fresh (and very good), the employees here are crazy fast (I'm in and out in 2 minutes) and offer great customer service. You can always tell the people who care and it's refreshing to be greeted here with a smile and have the person behind the counter remember your order."}
{"text":"I came in today to get lunch for my staff and myself  I brought in a list of the sandwiches they wanted. The 2 workers  did not seem like they wanted to work at all and seemed frustrated by my orders. Another gentleman came out and told them to be patient and get the sandwiches done. What bothers me the most is one of the tuna sandwiches I ordered came with some extra protein. See the attached pictures. There's a fly encrusted in the tuna.... This was not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Level of service has fallen at this location since the original management left for another store.  On this unsatisfactory visit, the first person, Michael, a heavy set Caucasian teen, made it his decision to prepare my sandwich at the same time as the next (unrelated to me) customer.    This resulted in me having to wait for that second person's meat and cheese to be sliced while I, and the next preparing person, waited to put toppings onto my sandwich because they needed to be placed onto the half that contained the meat and cheese.  Rather than apologize, Michael felt the need to attempt to rationalize his personal decision on the prep line that it \"SAVED\" time by not having to put the meat back into the refrigeration unit.  Based on that theory, it would make sense to Michael to leave all of the meats and cheeses out to \"SAVE\" time rather than having to go back and forth to the refrigeration unit.  Perhaps it is his lack of capability, or laziness in general, that leads him to believe that saving himself energy and the second person in line time benefits me in some way by making me wait and delaying my progress and the 2nd preparing person's time standing there waiting on him.  Evidently Michael believes his time is more valuable and his expenditure of energy benefits me, the customer.  Beg to differ Michael.  Sure hope that Michael learns to understand that each customer matters and should be attended to promptly rather than making one customer who is ahead in the line, wait for a customer that is further behind in line.  I hope that the restaurant manager of this store, Ann Hovel, addresses this very unsatisfactory visit to her store."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, dirty counters , lazy staff Not good for a fast food place that is across the street from a lot of medical facilities and the sad part they weren't even busy so there should not be an excuse as to why the counters were filthy and dirty and why they hadn't cleaned anything or why they were being lazy bums."}
{"text":"It's good. I like JJ and JM more, personally. Sourdough is on point. Service was okay. Better than Subway. That's my conclusion."}
{"text":"Cassandra is amazing and really cares about what her customers want! I will only go to this location , even if it means driving farther. Thank you for caring!"}
{"text":"i've been watching the ads on TV for Port of Subs, guitars, rock music, silhouettes. Cool. I also noticed the new sandwich....wait for it.......Grillers! OK, so it's just a grilled sandwich but hey, I'll give it a shot.   Many choices of Griller, Steak, Italian, Chicken, Meatball etc etc. I take the chicken with pepper jack. They heat the chicken in the microwave then put it into the bread with the cheese and press it in the hot grill thing. Then they remove and pull it apart for your veggies, can they not put the veggies in first? I dunno.  Good sandwich, I used to come here a lot and they still put a huge pile of shredded lettuce in the sandwiches when asked. That's ok but if you are not eating in, the lettuce spills out of the sandwich and in your lap/car/keyboard/tv remote/whatever is beneath your mouth.  It's a busy store, the guys that run it have been there a few years which is a good thing and everyone was looking happy as they dug themselves out of the shredded lettuce and finished their lunches.   Good option for lunch in North Summerlin."}
{"text":"I was starving so I just went to the nearest place......soooooo good!!!  AND The staff was so nice!!  Can't wait to go back!  OH!! AND It was really clean!"}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant and they always seem pretty nice....when you spend a lot of money. I came in here today for my free medium sandwich after racking up 100 points on my p.o.s. card, which by the way is a ton of money! not only was she incredibly cheap with the toppings, she told me that \"her\" store doesn't honor the free medium sandwich deal, only small. This woman who is usually very sweet was very short with me after I asked for more olives and pepperocinnis, which she only put two or three on. I probably won't come back here."}
{"text":"Corporate got a hold of me and was extremely apologetic about my day at Port of Subs. I have never had someone to reach out to me before to correct an issue. They apologized and issued me two $5 gift checks. They also advised that they would deal with their employees. Thank you Port of Subs for reaching out by going above and beyond. It shows that you care about your reputation as a company. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"When you have a 10pm flight that has been delayed several hours you need food. Port of Subs was the only thing open so I committed.  Service isn't over the top. It's an airport so I don't expect much. I was coldly greeted but my order was taken, I was offered a drink, asked if I wanted double meat double cheese, and I paid. It was seamless.  The meat is sliced to order which was nice and you're asked if you want all the fixings. You're sandwich gets loaded so I was glad I kept my sandwich as is and didn't opt for the the meat/cheese upgrade. The mayo was way too heavy handed for my taste so next time I find myself in this terminal I'm going no mayo/mustard and just oil and vinegar. It tastes better anyway.  Thanks Port of Subs. You helped me survive my hanger and flight delay."}
{"text":"Very nice but looking at the crusty layer on the mayo and mustard I should have walked away. But here I sit on a porcelain throne regretting that meal! The owner was very nice and Im sure they will get things back on track. I also had a franchise coupon and they wouldnt honor it saying it wasnt from them. They wouldnt honor a franchise coupon? Find a store with corporate standards as your digestive tract will thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a chain where I usually like the sandwiches.  This shop was no exception.  I've been here a few times while in town on business.  In a chain of stores, I think it's the people who stand out.  This shop has always had great service.  Friendly, helpful, and open to requests.  Good management I guess."}
{"text":"I recently went here for the first time. I went on a Sunday and basically had the place to myself the employees were quick to make my sandwich and they were helpful and kind. I imagine being that close to so many businesses they make most of their money on lunches during the workweek. But I'll definitely be back on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Port of Subs is my favorite, and this location is the best! The customer service here is wonderful. The staff are always friendly and courteous. They make the sandwiches just like I ask and always do so quickly. It is always clean and well managed. Coming to this location is always so pleasant and delicious! Great employees and great food!"}
{"text":"This Port of Subs seems to have gone downhill and the same level as a Subway but more expensive. The lettuce seems freezer burnt and the online order system is always \"down\" according to employees. I have ordered online multiple times weeks apart and every single time they have an excuse as to why my order is not fulfilled; this is plain bad customer service. It is at a point where I usually go to Cappriotties to get good service + a better quality in products. The people that work there are always annoyed when you ask where your online order is. I feel as if they don't check the system or refuse to make them unless your in the store."}
{"text":"Frequent this location often for lunch.... great friendly staff! Fresh veggies and sandwiches are always made perfect to my order!"}
{"text":"I'm bumping up a few start because Port of Subs and their corporate office is amazing. I received my full amount back for my salad, and they're taking care of out next catering event. I absolutely love port of subs--I can't let one bad apple ruin my love for it!!"}
{"text":"After seeing him take his bare hands and grabbing a stack of meat then making a comment about \"ha I'd probably be written up for that\" I will never go back there.   I hope he wasn't making your to go order. I literally stood there and watched him and he continued to make a joke of it.  Zero stars Health code violation"}
{"text":"I go to PoS a fairly decent amount. This is probably my most visited location since I work across the street.  The food is good. Always fresh, lettuce is always crispy unlike some locations. The staff is knowledgable and in over 3 years have never messed my order up. They also have one of those mix machines where u can customize your drink so that's a favorite.  The cons are really something that they don't control but have to be addressed. The area it's at is filled with several business offices. This means early in the morning and at lunchtime it gets super busy and the wait to get your sandwich is ridiculous. It also is a giant pain in the a** to park. There's also times on the weekend when there's summerlin events goin on and seating is hard to get to.   Quick roundup: if you go at most times, you'll have a 5 star experience, but at peak periods it drops down to a 3 star"}
{"text":"I love Port of subs I used to work at Port of subs when I was in college.  I don't know who the manager of the store is but they need to get their act together.  Store is very clean which is great however on a Saturday afternoon (today)  during a busy lunch rush there is only two employees trying to do catering orders and after waiting in line for 10 minutes I finally walked out.  Not one person in line was helped!    The subway down the block is disgusting and filthy this Port of subs should be cleaning up all the business!  It gets one star because this is the second time now I have walked out because the wait is ridiculous.   The need more staffing it's not fast or easy."}
{"text":"Seriously good subs and great, friendly, and professional staff. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many of times the food is great I will never go back because the way one employee female treated me!! she was so disrespectful because I messed up on the name of the cheese and I didn't want my sub  retoasted with mayonnaise on it. I asked her please just make me a new one she grabbed it threw it in the trash as hard as she could and just was very rude and disrespectful because she had to remake my sandwich that took her a minute and 30 seconds is all. she put handfuls of lettuce on my sandwich I asked her to take some of it off bc there was a lot of lettuce on my sub. she left me with barely any on my sub while shaking her head. I could see the anger on her face her body language. I told her you do not have to treat me this way because I asked you to remake my sandwich, and it took another minute 30 seconds. She rolled her eyes at me and then I asked her what is your name? She ignored me. I asked her once more what is your name? Ignored me again she replied if you need my manager I'll get him. She called him and Brian the manager showed up, told him what went down and he competed my meal for me,  I told him I didn't that. I don't want to be disrespected bc she had to remake my sandwich. She works in the food industry her job is to make people's food for them. So for her to treat me this way over a sub is just ridiculous.  Everytime I have been in there the staff was great smiles friendly I always leave a tip and today I still left a tip. I wanted to eat inside but I felt very awkward to stay in there and eat while this girl has treated me like crap. I still do not know her name but she is 5'3 dark brown hair little pass shoulder length high-school age. Just don't ask her to remake your meal or you will feel as if you did something wrong and that your dumb."}
{"text":"I have never ate at Port of Subs before, so I decided to stop by one day to buy lunch.  I like how they slice their meats and cheese fresh, but damn, they are really stingy with everything inside your sandwich! I went with the medium (8\") No. 5, which contained Smoked Ham, Turkey, and Smokey Cheddar Cheese. The cheese especially was sliced VERY thin, I could barely even taste it! I wish the lady who was working could have put more layers of meat in my sandwich as well, to make up for those thin slices.   Maybe I just happened to come in on a bad day, but there is nothing special about this place. The sandwich tasted okay and got me full, but I can't think of any reason why I would want to come back. I am actually a fan of Jersey Mike's Subs. Same concept - they slice their meats and cheeses fresh. I have not visited a Jersey Mike's here in Vegas yet, but the locations I used to frequent when I lived in California were awesome! They would really load up your sandwich with all the ingredients, it always tasted good, and the employees were friendly!   I should have spent my $6 across the street at Panda Express or even Krispy Kreme! Ah well, at least I can say that I finally tried Port of Subs."}
{"text":"I love Port of Subs. They are one of my main places for catering events. They help you load everything into your car, your orders are top priority and are done in a very convenient time and manner. Plus the Manager himself sits with you with a menu to go over the options and helps you idealize the portions accordingly. Every time I've gone in, even for a simple sandwich for myself, I have been treated with great customer service."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a long time and a few weeks ago when we were in Vegas I tried to stop by but they are closed on Sundays so I didn't get to try it again. I'm a big fan of the smoked ham and smoked cheese that they offer along with the mix. When I used to eat here years ago it was on the up and up and there was even a Quizno's by it that apparently they put out of business. I enjoy this place a recommend it."}
{"text":"Staff here is awesome. Playful nice group of guys working! Definitely eat here. Clean and fresh!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent, efficient service. The employees are super friendly and the restaurant is clean and well-run. This is my \"go to\" place for sandwiches during lunch."}
{"text":"The service is always great, but the owners don't keeps the place stocked with items like Avocado and Lettuce (For lettuce wraps). 50% of the time I place my order only to be told they don't have one of those two items. I avoid this location if I can."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC SERVICE, At lunch I show up occasionally, not only do they remember me - they remember what  I usually order. The thing I love MOST about this location is how clean it is. I never have to worry about getting leftover bits of other peoples orders mixed in to my sandwich. I drive past other franchise locations to come here!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience with the staff. I'm the sister of a previous reviewer and I had a horrible experience with the two men working around 2:30 PM on 5/28/18. They were extremely rude, had terrible attitudes and were not helpful whatsoever. I don't want to come here again. I ended up going to another port of subs where they happily accommodated me even though my money went towards this location. I'm not going to this location again. It's a bummer because I heard the owner is wonderful."}
{"text":"We use to go there all the time but then they started slicing the meat to where it was see through.  We now only go to Subway. The owner was quite rude to another customer on the phone inquiring about a party, too."}
{"text":"I like how other people who reviewed this location were upset that it was busy! Its lunch time at a sandwich place people.....and for how busy they can get I still make it from work and back in about 20 min which is saying something, since I work like 3 miles away. If Tina is there I know I am going to get fast friendly service. Love this location and its always super clean!"}
