{"text":"The food is really lacking. The people were nice, but it was not a good food experience. One thing that puzzled me though: the place was very empty, yet we were sat right by the bathrooms."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in one afternoon for lunch.  There was only one other table of two in the place.  We had a coupon for buy one get one free.  All the coupon had was an expiration date.  No exclusions or anything like that.  The food was ok.  I got steak fajitas that were very tough and they fill your plate up with rice and beans so it initially looks like your getting a ton of food.  We received our check and handed the waiter our coupon.  Our bill was 36 something.  (We also ordered two meals to-go).  The waiter came back with the new bill after the coupon and our bill was now 42 something!?  We were so puzzled and his response was I don't know what you want to do but I had to charge you full price for the margaritas since you used the coupon.  Sure let me use a coupon to make the bill go up!  How stupid!  We didn't even try to fight it!  At this point we were the only people in there.  For a place that doesn't get much business they should have just let us use it.   Or they should put on the coupon or on the happy hour board exclusions apply!  I'll tell you what, it may be 8 dollars we are talking but we will never ever be returning to Cancun.  Oh and on our way out he says we are changing the name soon so hurry up and use that coupon.  Um, no thanks!  When they change the name I'll leave a review again and continue to tell everyone I know that this place sucks!  There are far better mexican restaurants I will go to.  Si se√±or gives our table a free shot of tequila when we go there and let us use coupons during happy hour...we will stick to that place!"}
{"text":"Under New Management so we tried it.  It is newly painted and decorated inside and  looks GREAT!  We were very happy with our meals and the prices were very reasonable.  The food tasted GREAT and the service was really fast and friendly.  We will definitely go back there and I will tell my friends to go there too.

{"text":"Save yourself 40 bucks and go to Qdoba. This place is TERRIBLE and I don't have high standards when it comes to Mexican restaurants. My pork tamale was at least two days old and severely nuked in the microwave.  You know how left over pulled pork gets like leather strings when you nuke it? So was aforementioned tamale. We also asked for margaritas.  You'd just expect the house margarita when you say \"one margarita please\" right? Not at Cancun. They brought what I'd assume was one of the most expensive available. With both our dinners costing only 7.99 a piece, the bill miraculously came to 45 bucks. When I order just a plain margarita, I expect to not get taken advantage of. 50+ bucks with tip? Not worth it for microwaved food. I get better at Chipotle and Qdoba. We were the ONLY table in for lunch. Now I know why."}
