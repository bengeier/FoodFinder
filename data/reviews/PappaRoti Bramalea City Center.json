{"text":"I had the shawarma platter and maple eh bun, both to go. Customer service was friendly, good and fast. Maple eh comes with ice cream, chocolate sauce and maple syrup which the employee put into separate containers so I was able to enjoy it at home by assembling it myself which is always fun. The bun absorbed the sauces and ice cream nicely The shawarma platter included meat with sauce, rice and salad of lettuce, cucumber, tomato and onion. It was tasty, filling and at a decent price with enough leftover for lunch tomorrow. I liked trying this different combo that I'm not used to."}
{"text":"Amazing buns - superior customer service - will definitely be back!   Have tried the buns in Dubai & Vancouver and I'm soooo happy that they are now in ontario!   Very addictive !"}
{"text":"Delicious buns and tasty signature tea. The reason for my two stars is because I went two times recently with some friends after I promised them that they are going to have the most delicious bun ever. Two times for two days in a row and the place is closed with a small sign saying we will be back shortly!! We waited for about one hour no body showed up!! I even asked the phone booth across of it they guy said oh he is here but just went to grab something from the inventory! Well one hour and no show and then next day same story! Such a waste leaving the place for the kids to manage it."}
{"text":"The? (allegedly) famous bun itself was heavenly. Light, fluffy, slightly sweet and with a buttery center. It looks big, but it's so light it doesn't sit heavily in the stomach.  The tea I had with it is a traditional one called karak, and it's similar to spiced chai with milk. It was really good!   The lovely woman behind the counter was kind and helpful as well.  The reason I rate four stars instead of five (and considered three) is that there were no buns made and we had to wait 20 minutes. In a mall setting, that's too long. Maybe if they had cafe seating or something.  I suspect they're not getting enough traffic to have always-ready buns on hand. The McDonald's in that same mini-food court seems to dominate, which is a shame. (Seriously... The Asian place and Greek place had almost no customers, and the McDonald's line was huge!)   Anyway, these are tasty. You really should eat at this place! They deserve better...maybe a better location in the mall would help. I wish Papparoti lots of luck."}
{"text":"It kills me to give this place less than a 5.   When I went to Dubai years ago, everyone raved about Pappa Roti and how it was the new trendy place to have an afternoon snack. At one of the amazing malls there, we took a break from shopping and sat down at Pappa Roti. We had the signature bun, and let me tell you, I was in heaven. Buttery but sweet, warm bread that melted in your mouth - it was delicious. I don't really like very sweet things, so this was the perfect balance between savoury and sweet. Ever since then, I think about it from time to time and even googled recipes etc. to recreate it when I got back to Toronto but there was no point; it wouldn't be the same.  Fast forward a few years later, and low and behold, I spot a Pappa Roti at Bramalea during a visit. I was stoked! I immediately went over and ordered a bun, and a karak tea to go. The combo is about $4 - not bad at all - and they made the bun fresh. It was delicious and I savoured every bite. They sell the bun on its own, but also have signature buns with toppings like ice cream, labneh, chocolate sauce, etc. I'd want to try one of those next for sure.  This brings me back to my rating. The only reason I am giving this less than a 5 is because of the service. When I went the first time, the servers were lovely. After that, it's been less than stellar as you're dealing with the owner and she's a bit pushy/short.   If the service could be improved, this place would be great. Nonetheless, I'll return but only because of my love for these buns."}
