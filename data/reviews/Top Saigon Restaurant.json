{"text":"I would give them a negative rate if there were one. I ordered the brisket and beef ball pho, which came out to be the worst pho I've ever had.   When I came in, the waitress (the only one) ignored me like I was not a customer. So I took the menu from a table on which they put all the menus. There was some kind of grease on the menu, ughhh... The waitress put the chopsticks directly on the table which I assumed was as dirty as the menu. The pho was served within five min, which made me question the quality of it. Surprisingly, the waitress didn't give me the bean sprout and basil. How was i supposed to have pho without them I asked the waitress to bring me the basil. And she was like 'yea, right! The sprout!' Geez, what kind of staff was that. Then she brought me the veggies, but the stalk of the basil was so long that it extended out of the plate, and touched the table. So did some of the bean sprouts.  Sometimes maybe the staff sucks but the food is heaven, but it didn't happen today. The pho was horrible. The beef was so fat that even tasted like pork. And there were just three pieces of them. Moreover the beef balls were not well cooked, like they(1.5) were just taken out of the freezer five minutes ago. So disappointing. Don't recommend this pho at all. Pls just go to sunny supermarket to grab some instant noodle, which would be way better."}
{"text":"This was my first time there and it was empty on a Sunday night which seemed weird. The food was ok but the portions were small. The large pho I got was mostly soup. My friend's small had more food. The service was terrible. There was only 3 of us and the waitress forgot who ordered what. In addition she was not at all friendly. The location is convenient at finch and leslie. I will probably not recommend going there to anyone. If you want pho I say go check out pho 88 on yonge near empress walk"}
{"text":"I've only been here once and that is one time too many. While the interior isn't bad, the food isn't anything special and the service is terrible. I came in on a Saturday night and the restaurant was (surprisingly) pretty empty. There was only one other couple besides myself. I ordered a bowl of pho which tasted alright, but the portion itself was small and definitely not worth the price. I could get a bigger, tastier bowl of pho elsewhere for the same price. The server who took my order was unfriendly, but at least she got my order correct. After I paid, the server came back with my change, but I noticed that it didn't add up. I soon realized that they already took the 15% tip before returning my change. Ridiculous. I was planning on tipping before that happened, but now I'm planning on never returning.  Overall, I was very disappointed with my experience here and I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The pho here is pretty amazing, probably the best in Richmond Hill. I've been here like 5 times and mostly order the rare beef with noodles but on my most recent visit i wasn't feeling too hungry so i ordered the pork cold salad rolls and they were so gross... It basically was the white thicker viet noodles and some brown power stuff rolled up in rice paper. I was expecting at least some sort of meat. i still have no clue what the brown powdery stuff was..   aside from that, i would come back again. i'm just going to still to ordering pho."}
{"text":"Went there the first time when they just opened up the first time last summer; was not impressed. The place was still renovating, didn't have a lot items on their menu and I got the wrong dish.  Decided to give this place another try a couple weeks ago. I had their lemograss pork rice, it was actually pretty good. The portion of rice is way to much for me, but I don't eat much. I've been going their during my lunch break cuz they have good lunch specials for cheap! I like their house special rare beef noodle, satay noodle and curry soup base dishes. I've been absolutely obsessed with this place.  Glad I gave this place a second chance, definitely the base pho restaurant in town, highly recommend trying this place!!  Also the place, doesn't look like your typical pho restaurant, I think they overdid their decoration of the place, a pho place doesn't need to look that nice.. well at least to me... but its clean I guess i don't have to worry about getting diahrea there lol  Reasonably priced.. pho for less than 6 bucks"}
{"text":"OMG I love the curry crab here! I had it a month ago with my family, the sauce is amazing and goes really well with the vietnamese bun and roti they serve with. They also have gloves for this messy dish which is neat.  Would definitely go for the regular Beef special pho and spring roll if not up for seafood.   They have this one grumpy waitress... did they fire her yet?"}
{"text":"Admittedly it's hard to have high standards overall for typical pho restaurants, but it's pretty decent given location, food and prices.  Ordered the goi cuon (garden rolls), very typical and decently done.   Had Pho tai gan (rare beef with tendon). A bit on the salty side, but hey, which pho isn't? I thought they were generous with their meat and their small was more than enough for me, almost didn't finish the noodles.   If you do go, I would HIGHLY recommend the crab curry. Even though it's very messy (it comes with gloves and a lot of extra napkins!), the mess is definitely worth it. The best part is the curry sauce - just the right amount of spice (and I'm not a spice eater) and delicious flavour that you'll want to take home just the sauce to dip bread! A must-try when you're here.  Slightly loud televisions, but that's alright for a pho restaurant. Service is decent.   Decent overall, but you must try the crab curry."}
{"text":"Encouraged by the nice decor, I was hoping the food would live up to the ambiance of the restaurant... boy was I wrong!  We had 3 dishes here, all of which were disappointing.  1) sugar cane shrimp: while this was hot, delicious and full of shrimp flavour, one order only came with 2 pieces, which were very small for the price.  It's different from the other vietnamese places in that the shrimp was not mixed with anything else, hence the full flavour, but the portion was tiny for the price.  2) the pho: the broth did not have any beef flavour to it at all.  Served luke-warm and without any basil/lemon/bean sprouts - we had to ask for it and when the plate came, there was only 1 small slice of lime and a few basil leaves. The noodles were ok, the beef was tender, but the broth was tasteless and didn't have any pho smell when you take a whiff of soup.  3) curry chicken with bread: the bread was not warm nor fresh. the curry was bland and powdery.  I stopped eating after the 2nd bite.  Overpriced, poor service, small portions and flavourless food. Definitely would not come back again."}
{"text":"Rare beef and tendon pho, it was a pretty decent broth considering its a Chinese viet  restaurant.  The medium bowl was a bit on the large end for me as it was pretty salty, but on the plus side it wasn't too oily/greasy.  The prices are pretty decent, wouldn't mind going again, but I'll probably stick to my usual order of bun rather than pho."}
{"text":"Found this place tucked away on the second floor, hole in the wall status? =D  Food service was good, with the staff giving the right amount of attention. I found that the food itself did not standout from other pho joints I've been to and in certain areas, their food was just on par.   if you are in the area the other two or three viet places are good options as well, nothing special about this place unfortunately."}
{"text":"It seems after they opened a second restaurant and making money, they no longer need good service.  Food and service have plummeted.... would never go back to these restaurants for pho. Lots of other good pho places around."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. Service was terrible.  Overall, I would avoid this restaurant. They also have a location at Hwy 7 and Leslie.  I gave them a chance at both.. but after a few times of bad service and food... I would not go back."}
{"text":"Got take-out rare-beef Pho. They packed the beef on the hot noodles so by the time I went to eat it they were beyond cooked and tasteless, noodles were a gelatinous mess. Threw the beef out and most of the noodles. Not a single garnish (please sir, can you spare a bean sprout?). Hoisin and chili sauce in the same container. Thanks for assuming I like hoisin (don't). Nope, never again."}
{"text":"Not bad and not great.   This place has been open for a long time, and it used to be packed. However, there was only two other tables when I visited on Saturday night.   I would say the pho here is very average, with considerable amount of MSG. I get really thirsty afterwards. Most people order the tomato beef brisket pho - it's actually pretty good. The beef is tender and the soup base is filled with flavour.   Overall, not much to say about Top Saigon. It's in a hidden corner on the second floor of Time Square. I'd say there's a few other restaurants in this plaza that are comparably better."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister to buy some drinks from the grocery store, and we saw this restaurant. New pho in the area..Hell Yeah!  I was here for lunch two days ago, and last night for dinner. The seems to be only two waitresses here, both in smart uniforms. The younger waitress had her hair tied in a bun, and moved with great efficiency. The other waitress was more friendly.   The place was fresh. The gift baskets of fake flowers with cards of congratulations were placed at the front door, and the counter. The walls had glass lit sections displaying..nothing. They didn't even pick the art to put on the walls yet, that's how fresh this place is. Two cylindrical chandeliers, an open ceiling that makes no sense hanging chandeliers from, lightly decorated walls of printings of bamboo, cream coloured everything. Not tacky though. So far so good.  I ordered pho both visits, and honestly, whole heartedly...the best soup base I have ever had in the city of Toronto. The rare beef was quite raw, but cooks in seconds in the hot soup. The deep fried springs rolls was delicious. I ordered the mango juice, but it was more like mango slush. Too cold and thick for the flavour to come through. I couldn't finish even half the glass. Menu's full of things, so if you don't like Vietnamese noodle soup, there a lot more to choose from. I could say this place was very clean and the service was good, but the restaurant is new, and hasn't settled into this hole in the wall which used to be my old dry-cleaners. So...so far so good.  One round table at the end for groups of 8 or 10. Two television screen showing different programs, but mostly on Fairchild (Canadian Chinese network).  Closes 10pm weekdays and 11pm weekends.  It seems that many quality restaurants finds their dwelling place in Finch & Leslie plaza, and as long as they keep their standards, they remain their success here. I hope Top Saigon Restaurant is one of them. Any time I'm craving pho, this is my number one choice.  When I was sitting down, one hot mother and her beautiful Vietnamese daughter came in for dinner..followed by the Caucasian husband/Father with a permanent frown on his face. Every time he would give me a disapproving look when my glances shifts over to his daughter...so I eventually ended up staring. CHALENGE ACCEPTED! He stared at me back in defence of his girls....until I won the staring contest. THAT'S RIGHT! I'm bigger Mafuk*#%R!  If there's gon be gud lookin Womanz..I gon be LOOKEN..!! WALALALALA!!"}
{"text":"Top Saigon located inside Times Square has been in business for many years.  I have only came here a handful of times.  But the last time I came here it was a big disappointment.  Place was empty like we were the only ones during dinner hour.  Was a big clue to leave but my parents were too lazy to go else where.  Food was pretty tasteless and quality seems a lot worst from the last time I came which was over a year or more.  Weird how they still had X-mas decorations up and it was hanging over the table which was super dusty. I like how the dust can fall into your food while you eat.  Big turnoff. Pricing is average compare to other pho places.  MSG def been used here as I was super thirsty afterwards.   Average pricing and average food. Nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"This is a Chinese restaurant that offers \"Chinese-nized\" version of well known dishes from around southeast Asia.  The good thing is that food is fresh and tastes alright as long as you expect to get Chinese food.  If it is Thai or Vietnamese you are craving, there are better places in TO to get the real deal."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant within the first month it opened. We were excited because we love pho and love trying out new places. We were seated quickly and ordered two bowls of pho. and well...  - the portions were tiny - there was barely any beef in your pho - it is expensive - the pho wasn't that good  After we paid the bill, the staff never gave us back change. We sat there for around 15 minutes waiting for our change but nobody came to give us change or ask if we needed anything. In the end, we had to go up and ask them where our change is, because our change far exceeds the amount of tips we were suppose to give. The staff and I think the manager looked at me, and began to ask each other questions. It took a minute before they sorted it out among themselves and gave us our change. We were very tempted not to leave any tips, but we did anyway as a farewell tip, since it will be the first and last time we ever go there to eat again. It is a shame that this restaurant turned out to be so disappointing, especially since it is located right across from my home and I love pho."}
{"text":"This is the worst vietnamese food that I ever ate.  Curry was bland.  Pho was also bland.  Did they just put beef broth and rice noodles together?  The wait staff was really slow and unattentive.  They never checked if the food was fine.  The never came back with my credit card until I went to the register.  The pho didn't come with bean sprouts until I asked for it?  I'm never coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week.  It's our default when we don't know where to eat, ad we only have a hour.  The Beef Satay Noodle is excellent and a must try.  If you want Pho....I think it's number 93 thats the house special.  Get it in Extra Large and it comes to like $9....and it's as big as a Family portion.  Excellent value.  Don't go there if you're on a low carb diet...it's all carbs there."}
{"text":"Here for lunch today.  This is not a Thai or Vietnamese run restaurant per se but rather a Chinese (Cantonese) restaurant serving Southeast Asian dishes with a Cantonese influence.  The food is not bad but I am giving it one star for obnoxious service because the server and owner hassled one of our party about sending back a dish.  He ordered Singapore Noodles and was expecting the usual fried curry noodles with shrimp, pork, and chicken and instead got a soupy concoction with shrimp.  Who know, perhaps it WAS more authentic but it was not what he wanted.  They were very argumentative and made a stink about it and he decided to go hungry instead of ordering something else.  Furthermore, they forgot to bring an item I ordered as well."}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service  They changed the noodles in this place for the worse. They're simply too dry now, not enough water mixed with the noodles to give that smooth texture.  Also, they've really reduced the bowl sizes in this restaurant. Back then I could barely finish a small, now I can easily finish it AND drink the soup broth. It seems they're reluctant to raise the prices for the food, but in return they reduced the size servings. Honestly, I rather they raise the prices and keep the same portion.  Service is still good in here, although that could be partly because I know the manager of this restaurant. The wifi doesn't really work though.  I haven't been back since around April, so did they actually close this place down? I know there's two branches of this restaurant (the other in North York), but Yelp has indicated this place has been \"moved\". Hmm..."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated place, tasty food, a-okay service, but I just wanted to point out a couple of things that stood out to me -  1) no peanut sauce to go with the spring roll (I asked and was told that they didn't have any) 2) the spring roll was fried up in a floaty crispy way and was pretty meaty rather than the vermicelli version I'm used to 3) the vermicelli noodles here are THICK!  Definitely not the thinner sort that I'm used to and that carries the flavors of the fish sauce in a much tastier manner  I don't know if these differences were a restaurant specific thing or a Toronto thing, because this was the sole non-Chinese meal I had on our trip."}
{"text":"okie, maybe the one star a bit harsh, i didn't get sick or anything. but the food was just not good. bun pho and hianese chicken definitely avoid. (just not fresh, bad cut, the rice was in LUMPS, untasty, bun noodles definitely sitting out for a while, not a lot of meat, springroll bland or just not right); cooked oysters was ok.  pork and chicken rice dish was ok as well. pho flank soup was ok.  definitely would not come back again.  btw, four entree dishes and two oysters for 40$ after tax. amazing deal. decor and interior two thumbs up. but was extremely empty."}
{"text":"Mediocre food! Crap service! They left out the daily special menu so u won't order it from there! Took 10 mins of Waving our hands to get the boss lady who was sitting in the back's attentions to take our order!  I have never had Vietnamese meat platter rice paper that came with only 4 rice paper to make ur own wrap with! All the viet places I have been, came with at least 6-10 pieces! Even when we finish they would always give us more! This place charge us $2 for 4 dinky sheets of rice paper!   Doubt I will come back again!   So many viet place in Toronto! Why bother with mediocre food and horrible service!   Give it a past! So many food joints in that plaza!"}
{"text":"Came here after a workout with a few friends, looking for a quick and filling meal to replenish our resources. Noticed immediately that we were the only people in the restaurant, but proceeded on anyway.  FOOD: The menu was fairly consistent with what you expect from any Pho place, so I went with a \"Beef Satay Noodle Soup\" and a HK style tea.  My soup was of a respectable size, and met my standard for meat/noodle/spiciness ratio - so no complaints here.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: The lone server almost seemed annoyed to actually have to serve customers (place was empty other than us). She forgot our orders, despite there only being 3 of us, and was generally socially awkward from the very start. One of my pet peeves is when the server literally stands over you after handing over the bill, waiting for you to pay immediately while they wait. Overall, poor customer service.  ATMOSPHERE: The decorum of the restaurant is actually impressive, and probably the most lavish Vietnamese Pho place I've been to. However, the tables were sticky and clearly not attended to with much effort.   SUMMARY: Food itself was pretty standard, but the sub-par service means I'll be going somewhere else for my Pho fix next time."}
{"text":"Top Saigon Restaurant has opened up their 2nd location recently in North York.   Great selection of lunch specials which includes items that are available everyday and some are exclusively for that particular day of the week.  My Seafood Tung Zum Kong Soup Noodle ($6.95) which is one of the specials for Friday is A-OK. It has shrimps, cuttlefish, fish balls and even 1 fresh mussel. I requested extra spicy and fresh chili pepper were used and the broth was really coconuty...  Drinks are not free, as if you want to have a HK style tea or other hot drinks there are an additional of 65 cents. I might passed on that as the tea was kind of lukewarm and lack the taste.  Services are fast and friendly. Deco are nice and pleasant.......  No free WIFI but I was in and out in 15 minute.....   If you in the area and have cravings for some decent lunch specials, definitely give Top Saigon a try!!  For lunch specials, cash only!!"}
{"text":"Top Saigon Restaurant is on the 2nd floor inside Time Square.  They have lunch special from $5.95 that includes cold lime drink or tea/coffee. The specials are different every day, I have include that in my picture so you can pick which day have the food that you like.  Make sure to arrive before 11:45 AM.. yes this place was packed by the 12 PM!! They only have 2 waitresses so the service can be slow when is busy.  I really enjoy the food here, and I can't wait to come back and try other specials!  They just renovated the restaurant so everything is nice and clean.  BTW, they offer Free WiFi access too!!  They accepts Mastercard and Visa."}
{"text":"I ordered a Hainanese Chicken Soup Rice Noodle.  Why was the Hainanese chicken slightly orange in color?  The green onion sauce that came with it tasted bland.  The rice noodle in soup was okay.  My BF ordered a 3-meat Dry Vermicelli.  The meat looked a little charred/burnt, but he said it tasted okay.  They forgot my Durian drink order; I had to remind them.  It tasted refreshing, rich and tasty.  The service level was subpar.  The waitress left us alone with the menu for so long that we thought we would walk out of the door, and she would not notice.  She never had a smile throughout our stay .. to anyone.  It was as if she was having a bad day or didn't want to be there."}
