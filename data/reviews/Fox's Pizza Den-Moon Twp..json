{"text":"Food and staff are awesome! Will be back! Pizza was perfect and original cheese breadsticks are amazing."}
{"text":"I love the Fox's pizza chain, but this place just continuously screws up. The quality of their food is so inconsistent...floppy dough here and over seasoned chicken there. I ordered 2-3 times and there's always something wrong about the order. I ask for half topping, I'll get the whole shebang. And trust me, after getting the wrong pizza the first time, I made it pretty clear what I wanted the next few times. Yet, I still sighed in disappointment after opening that red box."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and amazing breadsticks. It's the kind of food you don't mind eating cold after its been in the fridge a couple days. I really appreciate all the RMU decor on the inside and love the fireplace and the seating area."}
{"text":"While my steak stromboli was good (although too much onion for my taste), I really don't appreciate being charged a $1.50 delivery fee when it is not even listed on your menu.  Not good when you are a new business. Lower stars for the delivery fee"}
{"text":"Was in search for a heart shaped pizza AND I FOUND IT. First time eating Fox's pizza and is quite tasty....the dough has a yummy seasoning which is different from others. This location was very clean and had a welcoming eating area inside. Staff is very friendly and willing to assist."}
{"text":"I like this place , it is so delicious. The workers there respect all costumers and they deliver the food on time."}
{"text":"Wrong order, mediocre pizza. We visited this location while moving our daughter to college. The girl reiterated our order verbally but put it into the computer wrong, get home and poof wrong pizza. Decide to just live with it. Start eating and after big city pizza this place is average at best."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. I got the steak wedgie and it was very bland. I always get the steak wedgie from their Hopewell location and the crust is different. Hopewell's is way better."}
{"text":"First time trying Fox's Pizza.  It was excellent.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  We will definitely order from Fox's again.  Delivery kid was very polite and professional."}
