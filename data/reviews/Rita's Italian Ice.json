{"text":"The perfect place to get your italian ice or custard on a warm day. Prices range from $2-$5. The portions are the perfect size and there is even a kids size for those that want something small. Also, they do provide samples if you aren't sure what to get, so don't be afraid to ask. Don't forget to show your student id on Sunday to get 25% off!"}
{"text":"This Rita's moves their lines pretty quickly. It is a walk up establishment so it's not ideal to be waiting outside in adverse weather. I always get the Gelati with either cherry or Swedish Fish Italian Ice, and it's typically made perfectly!"}
{"text":"the first time i had ritas i was not impressed at all. but for some reason after you finish it, you just want more! ritas is all over the place in pittsburgh so its a nice convenient chain dessert place (like dairy queen i suppose) that you can rely on for a sweet fix when you need one.  i've only ever had the gelati since i can't decide b/w italian ice or frozen custard... this satisfies both. i think it'd be stupid to get the blended one b/c that's just like a smoothie and you can't enjoy the frozen custard or the italian ice by itself. definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Rita's is yet another chain that so many people seem to love, but for which I just can't understand the hype (cf. Chipotle).  My mom is of the opinion that their water ice is overpriced and nothing particularly special, and I have to agree, for the most part.  I also don't think their custard is anything special.  When I do come here, I usually order the gelati, which is at least a unique product (but again, pricey at ~$4 for a small).  It consists of a layer of water ice sandwiched by custard on the top and bottom.  My favorite flavor combinations are citrus or mango with vanilla custard (I ordered orange custard + mango water ice once, and it was just too much).  The textures of the water ice and custard do work well together.  While the gelati can be a satisfying dessert, it's not unique or delicious enough that I find myself going out of my way for it--I usually end up here because a friend wants to come.  Personally, I prefer ice cream, gelato, or froyo--see my other frozen dessert reviews for recommendations.  While it's nice that they offer free water ice on the first day of spring, I always look at the endless line of undergrads and decide that it's just not worth my time. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I can give pretty much the same review I gave the one in Squirrel Hill. However, one thing that annoyed us was that this location didn't offer the first day of summer special of $2/3 for an ice/custard."}
{"text":"Being from South Jersey, I was elated to find a Rita's in Pittsburgh. Fro-yo and ice cream have a place in my heart, but sometimes I want a treat that's a bit more refreshing. Wooder ice/Italian ice from Rita's is just the thing. I was a bit bummed that they didn't have root beer flavored ice, but almost every flavor I've had has been packed with...flavor!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try one in LA and for some reason haven't gotten around to it, tried it here in Pittsburgh and fell in love! :D"}
