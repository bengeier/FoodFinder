{"text":"This is the hidden jewel of Cleveland!! Very authentic, incredibly inexpensive, and more than you can eat!! The service is amazing. They obviously take pride in what they do! We look forward to many more lunch and dinner dates at Cedarland!!"}
{"text":"Recieved exceptionally poor service today, wasting 45 minutes of my time. Their beef burger was appealing to me on their menu and I also ordered an extra side of fries at the shopkeeper's suggestion. Upon ordering, there was only one order ahead of me and I let the lady at the counter know I had no cash with me and asked if I could pay with debit, and also inquired if there was any minimum charge for card orders as this seemed to be a place that preferred only cash. I was from out of town and my bank had no ATMs in the area and I had run out of cash. She told me someone would be in after 5 min that could put the transaction through. The person did not come and I waited a while thinking the meal was still being prepared.

After 20 minutes, I asked about the status of the burger as other customers coming after me had already received their order and left. She indicated at a takeout box she had set aside and said the burger was almost done. The restaurant seemed to be a local joint with the chef just getting orders of 'the usual' from some customers.

After another 10 minutes of waiting I went back up to the front counter and waited for the new customers to place their orders. One gentleman also did not have cash and presented a card after his small order was ready but the lady managed to process his transaction with his help and he walked out with his meal. When the line finally shortened, I inquired again if the burger was done and this time was told the burger was already ready a while ago but that I couldn't pay with a card till the other employee came in. I asked if I could try to get their card reader to accept my card as the other customer had but the lady got busy with other orders and didn't spare any time for my request.

At this point I had to leave to catch the train to the airport for my flight, so I let the other staff member in the kitchen know that I couldn't wait any longer than the 45 minutes I was kept waiting and had to leave. No apologies were offered for the waste of my time. Maybe if they had let me know that the food was ready promptly and that they could only take cash right now, I could have got some cash back from a nearby store. I had been looking forward to their food as the kitchen seemed very clean and the lady behind the counter was cooking up some really fresh and nicely done salads, chicken, and pitas behind the counter. It's too bad I didn't get a chance to try it this time. I hope their communication with customers improves in case I'm ever in town again as I would honestly really like to try the awesome looking food next time."}
{"text":"Went here to try something a little different in comparison to all the trendy newer hot spots downtown.  I had been to Dervish in Tremont a handful of times with nothing but great experiences there, so I was hoping for something at least comparable to Dervish.  The owner Serge couldn't have been any nicer and more prideful of his career story and current menu.  He recommended my fiancee and I split the chicken salad and the chicken hummus between the two of us- amazing!   For dessert, we were able to split a rice pudding, which also was excellent.  The flavors were awesome, and he definitely strives to be a notch above places like Aladdin that get the food in and out of their kitchen to keep the crowds moving.  It's more of a deli/take out type setting, but they'll keep you welcome if you decide to have a quick lunch/dinner in their presence.  Would definitely go back again!  Excellent food"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after driving by.  Checked the reviews on Yelp and I decided to stop in for lunch.  The guy at the counter was very very helpful and patient as I studied their menu and asked questions.  He made suggestions and I finally decided to try the Hummus Shawarma combo plate.  I've had a lot of Lebanese food lately so I was excited to try this new spot. I really didn't care for the food at all.  The presentation was nice for takeout but the humus had a sweetness to it that was unexpected and there was some sort of seasoning on the meat or something that just didn't agree with me.  I won't be going back.  Primarily because it was also a very expensive lunch."}
{"text":"Discovered Cedarlane eight years ago when my husband was here here for surgery. We live in Denver so haven't been back. Came back to go to the Cleveland Clinic and to our disappointment Cedarland was gone. We found them in a new location downtown. The food was as good as we remembered and the owners are so friendly and take great pride in the restaurant and food quality. The hummus is the best I've ever had, they make it from scratch three times a day. The kebab and rice are wonderful, the meat is perfectly marinated. The only negative I can think of is they aren't located in Denver!"}
{"text":"Always fast and delicious. The pita on their sandwiches tastes very fresh every time. I like when it's soft and not too thick. I like the beef kafta sandwich and chicken shawarma platter. The owners are soooo nice. We often order for lunch and the delivery is speedy and cheap. I came in for a last minute to-go order for dinner today and they were so friendly and got my order ready with a smile despite getting close to closing time. The woman who rang me out said they will be moving locations. So sounds like they will be near metro starting next week(!?!). So maybe call them or check online before heading back to the usual 12th st location!"}
{"text":"Awesome! I had never had Lebanese/middle eastern food before, so the first time we went I was relieved to see Gyro on their menu. We have eaten here a lot since then, and not only is the gyro excellent, everything is! The kabobs (beef and lamb) are fantastic. The food is made fresh, no preservatives, I think it might actually be grandma cooking back there :) Friendly environment, family owned and operated. This is a hidden treasure of Cleveland! (Literally hidden since they moved from the clinic to 12th street. I was so afraid it was gone for good when I saw the Guesthouse bulldozed to the ground, thank goodness I called the number and they answered with the new location)."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, we weren't sure where to go. We decided to give this place a try. Being half Arab, I'm really familiar with Arabic food and have gone to tons of middle eastern restaurants. This restaurant was excellent! The food was very flavorful with high-quality meat. We ordered the shish kabob, chicken shawarma, grape leaves, hummus, meat and spinach pies...everything was superbly tasty. The owner was also very kind and chatted with us quite a bit when we first arrived. So, yeah...give it a try! It's good stuff."}
{"text":"Warm and friendly service; great food... Convenient location! I had the chicken shawerma sandwich, kibbeh and meat pie- all made quick and fresh!"}
{"text":"Consistently slow and aloof service. They also have a really awkward payment system if you decide to eat in and for a lunch place they close pretty early. Otherwise, the people there are nice and the food is not bad."}
{"text":"I would eat here every day if I could (and do eat here a lot).  Definitely ask about the specials.  And the grape leaves are authentic Lebanese grape leaves.  Excellent gyros and hummus.  And really great people."}
{"text":"This place is one and done for me. I ventured here for lunch on a Monday afternoon.  There were a few people seated at tables and a few waiting for to-go orders when I arrived.  I ordered the falafel wrap and tabouli salad, to go.  I sat to wait for my food, as more people funneled in.  20 minutes later, there were at least 16 people in the restaurant and no one had received food.  Approximately 5 minutes later, food was delivered to a group sitting across from me and the order was wrong.  Another 5 minutes goes by and more food starts to come out, to customers that had arrived, after I did. The kitchen was not set up efficiently, which was part of the problem.  The cook kept running in and out of the walk-in, back room, around the counter, etc. After waiting for almost 30 minutes, my food arrived at the counter and I was a bit disappointed in the portion, to say the least.  The tabouli order was impossibly small, more like a side order, for $6.99.  The falafel sandwich was $5.99.  I would think that that the ingredients in a full sandwich costs more than parsley, tomatoes, bulghur and lemon juice, especially for such a small portion.  I arrived back to work, and was even further disappointed, after the 30 minute wait, I expected my falafel sandwich to be hot, crunchy and fresh.....not so much.  The falafel was cold, soggy and mushy.  Twice as much pita, as filling. I couldn't finish the sandwich.  The tabouli had an ok flavor, but the bulghur was still a bit hard, and for $6.99, I would have expected it to be served on a bed of lettuce, with a few slices of pickled turnip, tomato or cucumbers and a side of pita.  This place doesn't compare to Nate's, Aladdin's, Sittoos, Kabob House, nor any other Middle Eastern place in the area, as it relates to value, cost, or taste.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!  The very just hummus I have ever eaten. Lilian and serge are he best and suck kind people. You won't regret a visit!!!"}
{"text":"Don't cha hate seeing 5 stars and don't cha wonder why? Did this establishment truly deserve 5 stars? 

Yes indeed! 
So this is a small, privately owned restaurant. You may dine in or take out. They have a sweet server who speaks limited english but she is so very pleasant with a big smile.

Serge, the owner....well make no mistake that he takes pride in his lil humble eatery.  He takes the orders , cooks and serves. He makes sure each guest is happy and it was pretty crowded at lunchtime. I only saw three employee including Serge... but every one made sure you were happy. 

Somehow my friends lunch order was overlooked, but when I asked Serge, he apologized more than once and brought us fresh, crispy Baklava as a peacemaker...like we needed it!

My Sharma  was warm and enough to share and my Kibbie was crispy. Very authentic Lebanese cuisine. 

Gonna make it a favorite lunch spot...plus it's a 2min walk from my job!"}
{"text":"Love the chix shawarma! Very tasty! My food was made fresh to order! Didn't have to wait long at all."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before an appointment downtown.  Got the Hummus Chicken Shawarma platter.  The chicken was very tender and tasty, the seasoning was pretty good, the hummus was just ok.  They put a hot sauce on it without asking.  It didn't bother me but I could see how some people may not like it.

Food came out in a sturdy, easily reusable to Go container so if you don't finish all you have to do is ask for a lid.  I thought that was a crafty idea for the lunch crowd.


Overall, it was just good.  Not sure if I'll return.  Can get better Middle Eastern food on Lorain  Ave."}
{"text":"Yum! I've been wanting to try this place for awhile, since it opened up right behind my apartment. I got the Lamb and Beef Shish Kebob with Rice. I thought the kebab with cooked perfectly, and while the rice was good, it was a little flavorless. I added a hot sauce I had in my apartment and it was fantastic them. I do think they were a little expensive, but I would go back for my Lebanese fix!"}
{"text":"The best chicken shawarma sandwich I've ever had. Such great flavor, and the garlic sauce was so wonderful- authentic, like a paste, and I would take a bath in the stuff, I loved it so much. Friendly service, great prices, and the hummus had notes of a somewhat peanut buttery after taste- very good. I'll be back... More than I'd care to admit."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I went there for a business lunch. 

I had the hummus and shish taouk. It was the best I had ever had hands down. The owner shared with me that they marinate the chicken for no less than 19 hours. I can't wait to bring my family."}
{"text":"What a find! The food was fresh and delicious and the portions generous. Truly a family-owned restaurant. Will definitely return and will be asking them to cater office lunches. The location is a bit odd, but the upside is that there's ample parking."}
{"text":"This place used to be on the campus of Cleveland Clinic and is now tucked away in the strip mall of sorts that has developed on E12th St, just south of Superior. 

I went in for lunch during the weekday, and was surprised to be the only one there. Naturally service was fast. 

All the food was made fresh when I ordered it. The nice lady who took my order turned around and told the cook just what I had ordered and it was made fresh for me. They even put together a side Fattoush salad for me which isn't exactly on the menu in that size. 

I would definitely return here for lunch, eat in or take away."}
