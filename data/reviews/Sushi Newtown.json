{"text":"Sushi wasn't so great. No creativity in the rolls. They are all variations of the same thing. The salmon sashimi was delicious, but the rest were just ok. Instead of providing low sodium soya sauce, it tastes like they just watered down the regular soya too much. Also, fairly expensive for just ok sushi. $42/ person without alcohol. 
I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Newtown is awesome! The restaurant looks like any small nondescript Japanese restaurant but the sushi is good and fresh. You can place your takeout or delivery order through their sophisticated website. I've ordered from a bunch of places in the Sud-Ouest but I find Sushi Newtown to be the best- it's not going to change your life but you'll be happy it's there on a random Tuesday night when you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Great to have a sushi place in this part of town so close to my place.  The salmon nigiri is delicious!  And they are very generous with their portions of edamame!  The roll I had was nothing too great, but not bad either.  I'll definitely come back to try more."}
