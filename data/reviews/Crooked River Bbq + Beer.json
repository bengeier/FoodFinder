{"text":"This was formerly Old Carolina BBQ. Same owner. This place re-opened under a new name on Monday (10-12-15). We went on Friday evening and it was awful. Lots of people. Lots of VERY confused staff. We placed our takeout order at 6:20pm and did not receive it until 7:05pm. This was for two hot dogs, loaded fries, 1/3 ribs and one leg/thigh chicken ($31). We observed many orders being returned to the kitchen from the dining room, countless patrons asking for refunds after long waits for carryout. Although continuous apologies were handed out by the staff we were extremely unhappy customers and the best tasting item we ordered was the fries. This place is pitiful. BBQ quality is the same (exactly) as Old Carolina and the dry chicken, too."}
{"text":"So much delicious food.  Definitely not stingy on the food portions.  Garlic mashed, onion rings and hush puppies were all great.  Good local beer selections on tap and in bottles.  We'll be back real soon."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed in this place.  I was so excited to eat here, as I love anything bbq.  However, the food wasn't good and the service was downright terrible.  This place was extremely disorganized and clearly not managed well.  They ran out of two different sides we ordered, so we had to choose something else.  This looks like a common theme after reading some other reviews. We had to wait in line for a while because there is one girl who is taking all the orders and running back and forth delivering all the food to the tables.  (There were people seated at probably only 5 tables in the place.)  We waited soooo long for them to finally deliver our food to us.  The ribs were probably the best thing we ate here, and they weren't anything to write home about.  They were cooked well, but overseasoned.  The bbq sauces were not good.  Mac n cheese was terrible.  Baked beans were just ok.  We ended up with two sides of apple slaw due to them screwing up our order, both of which barely got eaten.  Very heavy on some kind of spice....can't put my finger on it...nutmeg maybe?  Brisket was dry and flavorless.  We were given two coupons for free dessert in compensation for our long wait.  Decided to go back up to the counter and order them now, as we will not being coming back.  After waiting in line for about 10 minutes I just gave up.  There were two other people in front of me that had already been there for a while who hadn't even placed their orders yet, and I didnt have time to wait another 1/2 hour for them to deliver our dessert, so we left.  Thought maybe since this place is new it still had to get some kinks worked out, but now after reading other reviews I see it's been open longer than I thought. Not going back."}
{"text":"Had the smoked wings they were juicey, meaty, and smoked just wright.  I went with the spicy seasoning, and had all five sauces.  Some of the sauces were better then others...I would eat their wings again, much better tasting then BW3's, much more meat.  I always look at restaurants and ask myself the question, \"could I duplicate this meal at home?\", my answer would be no, solid wings, fair price...The staff was polite and the wings came out good to go...Looking forward to trying the ribs next time, the Old Carolina was sub-par at best..."}
{"text":"So, I decided to try this place out. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! I mean, the brisket was way to dry and had no flavor. The ribs tasted like they were reheated. I wasted money here. If you want go food, head a little farther east."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  The January special is a $15 slab of ribs.  Unfortunately they were out and the new batch wasn't ready   I Got the taco lunch special and wife had the pulled pork sandwich special   In summary, it wasn't bad but not good.  Very little if any smoke flavor.  I believe it's the same owners as before but the brisket was much better before.  I still want to try the ribs before I write them off but with this visit it doesn't look good. 

Service was good and the place was clean."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to some good old fashioned barbecue.  The food was average, and the service was terrible, just like the old place (Carolina BBQ).  When we arrived at 6:30 for dinner, there was no line and only a few diners in the restaurant.  Even so, our 3 orders took more than 20 minutes to prepare and came out at different times.  The line grew quickly and the poor guy behind me waited 50 minutes for his take out order.  The food is all smoked and pre-cooked, what could take so long to assemble a plate? Might give it one more try, but they won't be here long if they don't get their act together soon."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are delicious, and I love heir tacos! BBQ sauces are amazing. Can't wait till they get their staff together so they can deliver their product efficiently."}
{"text":"I was at Crooked River BBQ on 10/17/15. I got there around 5:30. I waited for nearly 10 minutes while the cashier stared at the register before he finally took my husband and I's order. I ordered the pulled chicken tacos. My husband ordered the pulled chicken sandwich only to be told by the cashier they were out of pulled chicken. I told him to hold it right there. You just took my order for pulled chicken tacos. Were you even paying attention to my order? Not a good sign to begin with.

We sit down and wait for my order. Around 5:50, my mother comes in to join us. She waits about 10 minutes in a non moving line. She sits down with us a 6. Still no food for us. That's when the kicker happens. At 6:20, my mother gets her food, before my husband and I. I go to ask the manager why this has happened and why we had to wait over an hour for our order for someone (my mother) to be served before us. I get told rudely by the manager to \"sit down and be quiet and wait.\" 

The food came, over an hour later. It was nothing to write home about. Then the manager comes up to my family and asks for my name and phone number. Are we going to be harassed now? Bad customer service all around. Food was meh. I felt sick after."}
{"text":"Strange to say for a BBQ place but their hotdogs are really quite good. The Blimp, The Hall of Fame, and The Brutus. I'd come back for those. The Frog looks good as well. Sadly, the brisket was dry, flavorless, and not appealing at all. Not to mention all 5 of their BBQ sauces are pretty abrasive and lack any distinct flavor other than vinegar. I'll be passing on that, and other BBQ here, in the future.  The hush puppies are small rocks. 

Tl;dr only come for the hotdogs and beer."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fast casual, great for families, delicious every time. Naked pulled pork with beans and slaw is tops!"}
{"text":"Excellent smoked chicken wings.  Most memorable I've had in a long time.  

Great craft beer selection.  Get the growler for r the best deal.  

Unique hot dog selections have been a new experience, ultimately an explosion of flavor.  The Frog and Brutus are my top two dogs.

Hate to say it, I haven't had the ribs, but heard they are traditional Ohio smoke."}
{"text":"CROOKED RIVER BBQ!!
They do it right!! I go on Sunday's to get the \"Sunday special\" ... The ONLY place I have found in the Cleveland are that does BEEF RIBS!! Perfectly seasoned and perfectly smoked. Just enough of each, in my professional opinion. 2 huge ribs **(not just meat close to the bone, no, a nice chunk of meat attached)** 2 sides and corn bread for $15.00!!!!  I know! Right!!! A GREAT DEAL!!! And great food 

Thank you guys at the Mayfield rd. Location. 
They asked me what I thought of the food and actually listened... I appreciate that."}
{"text":"The beer selection is better than most bars, along with the beer prices. We had a pulled pork sandwich and brisket tacos, both were delicious. We had a lot of fun trying the 5 bbq sauces. The tangy Taft was our favorite.
Devotedly worth a try!"}
{"text":"Place was terrible. Rude and confused workers, slow wait time, bad customer service, and the food was terrible. Much better BBQ places around."}
{"text":"Crooked River BBQ + Beer :
 This is the worst place I have ever been too. The service and food at this location was terrible. 

* The person behind the register did not know the menu. I asked about a  few items on the menu and she did not know the answer. 
* The food took over 25 minutes to get to the table. The items that were delivered to the table were not correct. 
* Everything we ordered was not hot and did not have any flavor. The sauce at the tables were not even usable. They were all clogged with dried up food, very gross and not sanitary.
* Manager came to the table and asked how things were. I told the manager of my issues and she said \" This is our first week open, and we are hoping to get through the growing pains\". 

This was very disappointing, if I had a guest complain I would make it right. 

***I hope who every reads this understands that this place is not worth your time and money. **"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Occasionally order take out for our work lunches. They never disappoint and the staff goes out of their way to make sure everything is perfect. 
The food is great and the Service is even better!!!"}
{"text":"When we first looked at the menu I was PUMPED! So many delicious sounding options, decent prices, good local beer! Upon waiting in line, we watched a very confused seeming girl behind the counter taking orders- when it came to be our turn, my fiance ordered his food and then the girl completely ignored the fact that I was standing next to him and totaled up the order for him without giving me a chance to order my food- kinda weird. My fiance ordered the two meat combo- he wanted brisket and turkey but much to his dismay they said they were \"out of turkey\"- so he got sausage instead. And a gigantic side of collard greens. The brisket was extremely tender and the greens were delicious (a bit spicy for me, but I'm a baby). I got the Frog Dog (anything with avocado usually catches my attention). It was good- I'm not sure the hotdog was all beef, but it was pretty good, I really enjoyed the Ranchero sauce. After seeing their bright display board broadcasting \"Cleveland-style Poutine fries\", I had to add those as well. We sat down to wait for our food (the man in front of us in line warned us it would take some time)- about ten minutes into our waiting, a staff member approached our table and said that the poutine sauce \"wasn't coming out right\", so they wouldn't be able to give them to us- and asked if she could sub out their loaded fries instead (she said they had cheese, scallions and bacon). I agreed, but was super bummed- this was what I was most looking forward to honestly. When our food came, it looked delicious but my non-poutine fries came out with pulled pork, bacon and some white sauce. They were good, but they weren't poutine or the \"loaded fries\" she was going to substitute. 
I would give the food probably 4 stars, but the staff seemed pretty terrible and the whole not having certain items kinda irks me a bit. All in all we would probably go back, but they could definitely use some improvement."}
{"text":"Not so good and overpriced. The brisket was very dry. The onion rings were nicely done in batter but very greasy. The pulled pork sliders were ok but $8 for 2?!  Really??  I honestly think I'll skip this place in the future."}
{"text":"Our takeout order included brisket, pulled pork, creamy slaw and potato salad.  The hits at our table were the mustard potato salad - which was out of the park - fabulous and the brisket.  The brisket isn't smokey but it was moist and tender. We understand that everything can't be perfection every day when serving bbq.  Our pork was over cooked, dry - if not burnt.  The slaw is something different - I just can't believe that the owner tastes that slaw often and claims that the best slaw recipe.  His customers deserve better than the flavorless,dry dish we brought home.  I do have to hand it to them on the sauces. Everyone enjoyed them.  I can't tell you the name of them because our take out included no names to the sauces nor does the website.  You can tell the effort that was put into the sauce combinations.  We thought it was a great value and will sure try it again and next time eat there for - it looks like a great space."}
{"text":"Really, really, really don't get all the negative reviews. I am guessing it is because most people on Yelp tend to suck and also don't/can't comprehend that a slab of slow smoked pork ribs simply has to cost more then their usual dinner of a breaded artifically flavored mcchicken patty. Real meat costs real money people and since time is money bbq is pricey.
The ribs were tender with good smoke and nice pull, the pork was juicy, all the sides were on point. The fries were crispy and hot and management stopped by to see how everything was. Add in a cold Dortmunder draft and it was 44 dollars well spent.
They were out of slaw and cronuts, the latter the kid really wanted to try but a restaurant has a ton of moving parts and they clearly prep only what they think they can sell in a day. Tons of specials including a daily late night happy hour with half price food and beer and salbs of ribs for 15 bucks through January. Just keep doing what you're doing Crooker River and don't worry about the haters. Most of them drive home to their parents basements, turn on their anime and write bitter reviews because they have no job or even vague conception of what a real bbq joint is."}
{"text":"Wow, what disappointment, dirty place with sticky floors and tables. Meat was so dry, had to use lots of sauce just to get down a couple of bites. I left the rest. Ordered the collard greens, nowhere was it stated that they were spicy--too hot for me to eat or even my husband who loves spicy food. The corn bread was under cooked too. Horrible experience, however, everyone seemed very nice."}
{"text":"The meat is locally sourced and was very good; I had the \"naked brisket.\" The two sides I chose, weren't anything stellar though. The white cheddar mac' n cheese was too garlicky and the original hush puppies were hard to bite into, either too much batter or fried too long. The mini corn bread was super moist and yummy though. I will definitely go back for the beef, but will select different sides."}
{"text":"The brisket was dry, tough and flavorless. The green beans were straight from a can, then mixed with beef broth. The baked beans... we'll just file this under \"trifling\". And I'm not sure how the wings were cooked (in a kiln?), but they weren't much different in texture than the brisket, and devoid of any flavor. The only saving grace was the sweet potato casserole, which was mediocre. 

The place seems to have had some money invested into it; the layout was very nice and had a great atmosphere, but I just don't understand how the food, just about all of it, was so many miles away from how BBQ should be done. Slow-cook your meats; add some smoky flavor; cut against the grain; use fresh food (beans); BBQ 101 was completely disregarded. I gave it two stars only because they recognized veterans and gave a free meal, but honestly, that's probably the only way they're going to get people to eat this food."}
{"text":"Saw a review on northeast Ohio celiac network. Finally got to try! All sauces, rubs and meats are gluten free! Management willing to work with you, much made in-house. According to manager, apple slaw and garlic mashed potatoes are safe and they were yummy. There is no dedicated fryer. The brisket and turkey have great taste with just the rub although a little on the dry sidThe sauces weren't our style although the hot Harding was a nice addition although not very hot."}
{"text":"The meat (pulled pork and beef brisket) tasted much better than Old Carolina, and I enjoyed the large portions and sides (nicely baked sweet potato). Much like Old Carolina, my husband and I were able to split a 2 meat platter.  We also loved our beers on draft (hefeweizen and imperial pumpkin ale from fat heads).  The service was fine, although my 2 major complaints are the lack of a really hot BBQ sauce and I miss the Brunswick stew that Old Carolina had.  The alcohol was a bit pricey, but I'm trying not to be too picky :)"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write a review after seeing so many negative ones. I had ordered food once shortly after they openned to-go, and it took a while, but it was standard.  When I took it home, I was happy with it, but it didn't particularly stand out.  I wanted to try it again after seeing adds for the beef short rib on Sundays and told my sister about it.  She almost didn't want to come after seeing the bad reviews, but we decided to go anyway.  We went on Sunday (yesterday) around noon and ordered a large amount to share.  I have no doubt some people have had their rough experiences there during this first month of being open. But, the following experience was ours, and it was exactly the opposite. 

We walked in and asked questions of the menu and they were answered promptly.  We asked for a suggestion regarding which dog the cashier liked best, but she hadn't eaten any.  However, she asked another employee for her suggestion, and also told us the most popular ones.  We ordered one dog, the short rib meal with hush puppies and collard greens, loaded fries, and smoked garlic parmesan wings. We sat down at a table and were settling in for a long wait, based on the reviews.  Within 5, maybe 10 minutes, all our food was out to us, hot, and juicy.  The short rib was impressive, with a good bark and nice size, very juicy, and not over smoked.  The 2 of us split one rib, and took the other home. The Loaded Fried were huge w/ moist strands of pulled pork, crispy fries and bacon, shredded cheese and cheese sauce, scallions, and sour cream. The tangy taft bbq sauce went perfect with it.  Whomever posted that all the sauces taste the same have no tastebuds.  They were all pretty unique, and my favorites were the tangy taft, hot harding, and the cherry one.  The dog we got had pulled pork, apple slaw, white cheddar sauce and bbq sauce.  The apple slaw was crisp and tasty, and the bun was a grilled split bread bun, like the kind nickles makes/made, or the kind you often see lobster rolls on, not a standard hot dog bun, which was a nice touch,  The wings were very good, crisp on the outside, moist on the inside, smoked and rubbed gave them a great flavor and the parmesan garlic was a dry seasoning which i tend to prefer. I doused them with a tiny bit of the local hot sauce (not the bbq sauce) they had available, and they stood out.  They were my sister's new favorite wings almost instantly.   Regarding the sides, the cornbread was moist, the hush puppies were some of the best I've had, and the collard greens were spicy with a lot of pulled pork in them,  All pretty good, with the hush puppies standing out. We didn't imbibe, tho we saw they had a nice little draft list and the bloody mary looked great. 

We took a little bit of everything home and were able to take cups of all the sauces with us.  We asked about a friend who has celiac disorder and can't have gluten.  The waitress wasn't sure what was gluten free, but the manager came out and talked with us and gave us a menu that he personally circled all the gluten free items on.  Our service was quick, professional, and helpful.  We were happy with all the food we ate, which was hot, juicy, not oversmoked, and seasoned well.  I realize not everyone will have the same experience we did.  Perhaps when you smoke long hours over night, certain things become less quality as the day goes on.  However, at noon on a Sunday, everything aligned well for us here.  We will definitely be back, and bringing friends.  I should also make sure to mention that with all that food, enough to feed to big eaters and have a full meal at least to bring home, the price was in the mid $30s, slightly over $40 with 20ish percent tip.  In our opinion, that price was great with more than enough food for 2-3 people (in comparison, we ordered pizza delivery the night before, 2 pizzas with multiple toppings, 20 wings, cheesy bread and it was 50ish bucks).  We enjoyed our experience here, and wanted to let people know that we feel it's worth giving it a try, since we almost didn't due to the negative reviews.  Hope this helps."}
{"text":"I admit that on my first visit here I complained to their corporate HQ because of appalling attitude of their employees. I've been back twice since and the offending employees weren't here. As a matter of fact, the shift lead here today was a breath of fresh air. Friendly and informative and gave us coupons that seriously helped their normally high prices. the food quality was middle of the road. the sides are all a total waste of time... not fresh and not flavorful (especially the mac and cheese... ick). And the other concerning factor here is the point that my hubby and I have never seen a single other person in the building all 3 times we've been here. it's always just us... at lunchtime. I hate to say this... but I don't see this location surviving."}
{"text":"Decided on giving this place another shot after the first debacle shortly after opening under the new brand. Service was slightly faster and the person working behind the counter was pleasant and friendly. But - they were alllllll out of beef biscuit and said they had a big order. Possible I suppose but either way another letdown. Too bad."}
{"text":"Love it here! Honestly better now than when it was old carolina!! Beers great too! I recommend the short ribs!!"}
{"text":"Love their beef brisket, was really good, my son didn't like their chicken but loved the bbq brisket."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here..service was amazing Ebony is so nice to everyone she also went over menu with us brings that it was our first time there. We be back over and over since food is great and so is service!"}
{"text":"Had the ribs, green beans and fries. One son had plain wings the other had ribs with me.  Both sons loved and, more importantly, ate their entire meal. The ribs were sauced but not sticky and not greasy at all. They have several sauces on the table so you can choose your level of sweet, tang or hot. I had tangy and found the sauce really enhanced the ribs. 

The green beans were wet but not soggy, with a tiny bit of a bite. A good side. The fries are crispy but not very salty. 

I'm not a barbeque snob but I do come from Memphis and this meal was quite tasty. I'll be back...."}
{"text":"I called crooked river to place an order recently. The employee named Yolanda said that \"we're closing in a half hour\". The very first words that came out of her mouth. I asked if I could place an order to which she replied yes. I began the order and she said \"we're out of practically everything.\" They clearly did not want by business and seemed like my call was a burden to them. I'd be surprised if this place makes it another year with this kind of customer dis-service."}
{"text":"Disappointing at best.  Ribs are tough St Louis.  The char and sauce were actually good ... Neither my wife and I could get through some of our ribs.  Plus he didn't really change the sides .. Same stuff from Carolina. Except the ribs were better at Carolina and they were average.  I got taken in by the website .. Thought was going to be farm to table ribs and flavorful fresh sides.  No it's hard to eat ribs and bland sides.  This is certainly not how Ohio does bbq!"}
{"text":"The food and service were good. They show you your food before you take it. Most places would give you burnt food and you wouldn't know it until you got home. The sauces are good and they have a nice size selection of them with different types of barbeque options, brisket, chicken, Turkey, pork of course and hot dogs just to name a few."}
{"text":"We got takeout from here.  Some items are better than others.  I give Crooked River credit for trying to be creative with their different hot dog and bbq combinations, but none of it was executed that well.  All the items we tried had some good flavor, but some meats were dried out (the chicken and the brisket) and the sauces all taste similar.  None of the flavors really pop on their own.  

We liked the hot link sausage and the pulled pork the best.  It is hard to find a good hot-link so I would order it again with a cold beer."}
{"text":"I really wish I could just comment without rating because I have yet to try their ribs. 3 times I have gone there (twice as old Carolina and once as crooked river) and they were out of ribs. And it's not like I was there an hour before closing, nope random Saturday's or Sunday's, though one time it was super bowl Sunday at only 4:30 and they were out of almost everything and the workers were complaining as they got stiffed by a co-owner who didn't prepare for super bowl Sunday and they had to deal with the irate customers.

Don't think this place will be around long. Menu is very confusing.

So I did manage to have one of their gourmet hot dogs and brisket, with side of beans. Nothing special that would make me want to dance."}
{"text":"Hey there! From the looks of things you're in the mood for some cooked animal. I know how you feel. It wasn't all that long ago when the same feeling came over me. My primitive brain and its desire to gnash on some protein that once had eyes was calling. I needed to stuff my gullet with as many different kinds of once-living creatures as I could and I needed them to be cooked up all low and slow like. BBQ, baby. Sure, the reviews of this place were a bit spotty, but sometimes you just gotta head out and see for yourself. So we did.

Here's the deal. A small, locally-owned BBQ joint tucked away in a suburban strip mall that serves up all Ohio-sourced grub along with some thirst-quenching craft beer in a sort of fast casual a la Chipotle-esque kinda way. I think this pretty much sums it up. The process is pretty simple. Enter, walk up to the counter, order your food, take a seat, get served said food. I highly recommend coming to the counter knowing what you want. It's not rocket science, but it will help things move along in a more orderly fashion. Good for you. Good for the hungry people behind you. Just good for everyone, really.

The menu is really about BBQ. Sure, you can get hot dogs all done up fancy like and they have salads - although if you come here to get a salad you should probably be slapped - but it's about the meat. They've got turkey, chicken, pork, ribs, and beef. You can actually eat almost an entire farm here. Sausage, wings, brisket, pulled, shredded. It's all smoked and cooked to perfection. I'm wanting it again as I write this. Also, the meat is served by the pound and you can get it as a sandwich, tacos, sliders or on its own and it comes with a side of cornbread and a pickle.

First gripe. The menu online doesn't match the one that's in the restaurant. They've made some changes to their pricing and whatnot and, well, just be aware of it. Hopefully they'll read this and tighten things up.

Second gripe. They don't have the draught list posted. Sure, they've only got six taps, but if you have to ask someone to explain every beer that could really get in the way of productivity. Know what I'm sayin'? Chalkboard it or something.

Now the good stuff.

As far as what everyone else was saying about the service, we didn't experience any of it. Sure, the place was pretty empty during our visit, but our overall service experience was quite pleasant. The cashier - being trained by a manager - did her best with minimal hand-holding and our food was brought out to us in about five minutes or so. I didn't exactly time them so it might have been 10. Either way, it didn't feel all that long.

Another note. They don't sauce their meats but at the tables you'll find a selection of 5 different sauces, each named after a president, and each with its own personality. From sweet to heat, you'll find one you like. Try them all.

We got the following to share - a pair of pulled pork sliders, 1/3 slab of ribs, hush puppies, cole slaw, beef brisket, a baked sweet potato and a sausage. Told you we did it up. The wife and I can throw down. 

Let's hit some of the highlights. The cornbread is delicious. Soft, sweet, a bit sticky. Just everything it should be. And spread on some of their sweet cream butter and damn. The hush puppies are crispy little corny balls of beauty. Add the aforementioned butter, of course. The slaw is just as it is supposed to be - creamy, slightly sweet, and not messed around with. And it's a real portion, not some shot glass-sized insult. Speaking of sides, they've got so many that you could make a meal out of them on their own. Moving on.The sweet potato was soft, sweet, buttered and just right. But the real star, of course, was the meat. 

The pulled pork was perfection. Tender, juicy, and smoky and those sweet little buns. Just get them, trust me. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone and delicious and the seasoning and smoke levels were spot on. The sausage, smoked and then grilled, was tasty and packed some heat of its own, but I wasn't blow away by it. I thought it was just a bit dry and grainy. Not that I didn't eat every bite, mind you. The brisket was also delicious, but a tad on the dry side as well. It sort of fell apart as we were eating it. Great flavor and very tender, though. 

I walked out of this place with a pleasantly distended belly, unctious, greasy, smoky remnants of my meal still fresh on my lips and the feeling that can only come from a massive meat feast done right. Seriously, this meat was damn tasty and we did it up. I wouldn't exactly call Crooked River pricey, just on par with a place that sources high-quality ingredients and takes care, and time, to make sure they're prepared correctly. Our Groupon helped to cushion the blow a bit. The bill came total bill for our carnivore extravaganza came to somewhere around $50 before our Groupon. We went a bit crazy, though, so your bill will probably be somewhat more reasonable. Not as fun, but more reasonable."}
{"text":"The menu made this place seem like a great Father's day dinner destination. There was no wait in line around 3pm and service at the counter was perfectly fine. With a party of 4, I waited 25 minutes in the dining room before a lady came to us and explained that they lost our order. Keep in mind the place was not busy. After about 5 more minutes the food arrived. 

I had the CLE Po-boy. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect because the menu was sparse, but it was tasty. The sausage was served on a regular white hot dog bun that fell apart after one bite. There were approximately 6 French fries on the Po-boy with slaw and BBQ sauce. It did not come with any sides. My table also ordered Parmesan and garlic smoked jumbo wings. They were not jumbo, nor was there any seasoning other than smoke flavor. I saw an order of fries next to my plate ($3?) that were lacking in \"house seasoning\". 

Overall it was an underwhelming eating experience. I wouldn't recommend eating in. Hopefully takeout or other elements of the menu are better than what I ordered. Otherwise they will face the same fate as the previous restaurant in this location."}
{"text":"We try to keep ourselves eating at this place at a max of once a week. We can hardly stand living so close and not eating here daily. 

Hate hotdogs? You've never tried the frog dog. All hotdogs here are incredible, topped with brisket avacados, close slaw, etc etc the list goes on and on. 

The barbecues are all amazing and make which ever delicious tender meat you try , out of this world. Try the cherry one!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE.  The turkey wasn't even edible.  Dry, chewy, tasteless and the dog wouldn't even eat it.  In addition, the customer service is horrible.  Waited 20 minutes for take out."}

{"text":"Overheard a cook telling another cook he needs a bun to put his wiener and followed by a pink haired tattooed girl telling me that I could not use a coupon I had only to have the general manager finally come out and oblige not very good and or advisable for A start up restaurant"}
{"text":"I like what they make here.  It's all Ohio sourced food that is some of the best BBQ anywhere.  4 stars for the food and 2 for the service.  The place has cool industrial decor and the food is pretty tasty.  

I recommend the pulled pork sandwich, then top it with one of their excellent sauces which include sweet, hot, red, brown, and yellow.  Something for everybody.  The fries are really good too.  Hot dogs are also above average.  The sides can be hit or miss.

The beer selection isn't too shabby.  There are about 10 choices in a bottle and a half dozen on tap.  You'll likely find what want to wash down some BBQ.

However, behind the counter there seems to be consistent disorganization and apathy.  I see orders waiting while workers wander around or just do nothing.  Don't come here if you are in a hurry.  For 1 sandwich, I waited almost 15 min after seeing my order sit ready for almost 10 min.  Seems like they just need direction and management.

It's worth the wait if you have the time."}
{"text":"Great food! Not quite what we expected- more like a fast food kind of feel. Order at the counter and they deliver your food to your table within 10ish minutes. 

Highly recommend the mac & cheese, the blimp hot dog and the hush puppies (oh my)!! And the wide variety of sauces - wow! 

Truly a hidden gem if you're looking for comfort food/ good home style BBQ"}
{"text":"The only question I ask myself when going to a new restaurant is whether I'd come back again.  My answer for Crooked River is \"YES\".  It's worth a shot...my experience was good.

SERVICE 6/10: The girl at the counter was friendly, she answered my questions and greeted me with a smile, that's about all I ask for.  The kitchen crew seemed to lack a sense of urgency and enthusiasm.  Disappointing considering you can look right at their faces when they are making up your meal.  I was literally the only person ordering food while I was there and it took 10 minutes to complete my order.  Something for management to work on.

FOOD: 8/10:  I got the pulled pork and brisket with a side of mac and cheese.  The meat was very good; flavorful, smoky, and moist.  The mac and cheese was OK, a little dry and a weird chunky texture.  I REALLY appreciated the cherry barbecue sauce.  Different and definitely worth trying if you like sweet sauced.  The other sauces were good as well, no complaints there.   

VALUE: 7/10:  $14 for two meats and one side is acceptable. 

The local craft beer selection is a nice touch but really only if you dine in, which I did not do."}
{"text":"So based on food alone they would have 3 stars but thats just not the case..arrived just after 5pm..they had a private party going on but they looked to be well taken care of and winding down...after placing our order we got our drinks and found a table...went back to wait for our food and was told they will bring it out to us...after 15 minutes and watching someone who ordered after us receive their food i went back up to the desk. ..and watched as our food sat on the counter and for another 5 minutes before they finally brought it out...and they didn't have our full order..it took the food runner 3 separate trips..heres a run down of our order
Pulled chicken..not actually pulled but diced and dry
Turkey..very good moist and tender 
Pulled pork..very good..lot of flavor
Mac and cheese..not the best but not the worst
Greenbeens..good..the only hot side we got
Banana bread pudding..full of butter but not horrible
Overall food was 3 stars service was 1"}
{"text":"Service was horrible, 7/1/16 at approx. 6:00pm I  was giving my order to the cashier, the phone rang and she answered the phone and took that person order. After taking the phone order she walked away and began talking with an employee. She did not say anything too me.  Just walked away. I stood there for a few minute waiting, when she did not return to the counter I walked out. There were at least four employees, along with the manager standing behind the food counter talking."}
{"text":"Perhaps better than when this place was part of the Old Carolina. Ribs are smoked unlike so many of the old standby rib joints (yuk)in Cleveland. Sauces are on the side. And new items such as chicken and waffles have been added."}
{"text":"Not sure what the negative reviews are all about but I love this place just as much (maybe even more) as when it was Old Carolina. Sure, the prices are a little steep but my husband and I have had nothing but consistently good food and service since we started eating here. I'm an extremely picky eater and admittedly judgmental when it comes to service and I cannot say that once in the many times we've been there have we experienced anything worth complaining about."}
{"text":"I read the Yelp reviews, and to be honest I wasn't expecting this to be that great...but wow!  This is the best barbecued pulled pork I've had in Cleveland, period!  First, the place is like a BW3's in the way that you order, you place your order, give your name and they bring the food out.  You fill your own soft drinks...they also have beer.  
The dining room is clean and spacious, music is playing and tv's are in but it is not loud.  You can have a conversation.  There is also an outdoor seating area that is comfortable. 
Ok, now for the food: I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, which was on a grilled bun.  The bun was fresh and was very tasty in its own.  The pulled pork was sauce less (there's bottles of different sauce that you can add yourself, including a cherry based one that's really different-in a good way!) and it was not fatty. It was the perfect texture and wasn't dried out nor soggy.  With this, I got an order of onion rings-these were amazing!  Hot, crispy, and the onions inside weren't soggy. 
My husband ordered \"the dawg\", which was a quality hotdog wrapped in crisped bacon and topped with jalapeños and hush puppies.  It also was topped with a creamy sauce of some sort.  He liked it a lot.  He got Mac and cheese as a side...this is a creamy (not oily) white cheddar version that was very flavorful without being spicy, oily, or too salty. This is something my child would eat, yet adults would also enjoy it.
My sandwich was huge, there was a lot of meat on it...my husband ended up eating half :).
Now, the best part is the sauces.  They're named after presidents (see photo).  The mustard was fantastic, and the cherry one was surprisingly good.  These sauces are not the type of bottled bbq that's typically found in your local grocery store, they're different and they're fantastic.  
We still can't we over how good this food was.  :)"}
{"text":"The service is not the issue here - nice people who just don't know how to clean the front of the house - afraid to see the kitchen...  Had the brisket and it was dry tough and flavorless - just like meat sitting in a warming tray for a day or more would taste... get the idea.  Green Beans were very good, Collard Greens were bathed in Quaker Steak's Atomic Sauce - no kidding we left them on the table they were so hot.  I've never been served Molten Corn Bread - probably a specialty of the house or just an unadvertised special - or possibly they just grossly undercooked the muffins because my was literally corn paste in the middle.   Finally the floor under more than one unattended tables was stocked with all kinds of food, French fries, scraps, and other morsels just waiting for someone to clean up or critters tonight.  I love good BBQ and this is sadly a place I won't return to."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment from what the original used to be as Old Carolina BBQ.

Come to find out the original franchisee left the owner and started his own in the exact same location,  exact same equipment, same recipes. Got sued, lost the battle and now uses his own poor substitute  recipes.

The pulled pork was dry yet had large chunks of fat cap that should have been removed before it was shredded. ( we bought two pounds of pulled pork to go. ) These pieces of fat cap were almost the size of the palm of your hand. The BBQ sauces are very poor imitations of the original company's sauce. They have some really weird ideas about a cherry barbecue sauce and the mustard sauce is not nearly as good as the original.

Was looking forward to their Apple coleslaw but it too was a far cry from what we expected. the only bright spot was the super yummy cornbread, it was my favorite but my wife thought it was way too oily didn't like it at all. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the family pack brisket with bourbon baked beans, green beans, cornbread and two chicken tacos. The brisket was juicy, tender,& piping hot. All the food was very fresh and the sauces are amazing! Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Always live to try a local eatery so we decided BBQ take out would be ideal. Placed the order and told 20 minutes, which is not bad. Upon entering the place (Sunday night 7PM) two people outside and five of us in line to order/pick-up. After waiting 15 minutes, finally got to me.

First the server could not find the order. Would help to spell John J-O-H-N not D-O-N! After she found the order, she put it together. Asked for a variety of the sauces which was needed on the take out.

When I got home (only a 5 minute drive) opened the containers. My wife ordered the \"naked\" pulled pork and I ordered the Brisket sandwich. Not hard you say, well the containers were 1) Naked brisket and 2) pulled pork sandwich! Okay we weren't all that concerned, but then the temp of the food was warm at very best! Okay, cold! Both the sandwich meat and the naked meat. If the total time taken from order to pick up and back home was no more than 20 minutes, it should have been at least warm. Oh, I forgot the 15 minute wait in line; maybe that was the reason.

After deciding to just try the servings after doing a nuke job to temperature, that did not even help.  The pulled pork was dry and disappointing. The quantity was exceptional, but even that could not overcome the overall negatives. The brisket, again a good portion, was average said my wife. As a food critic, I put up with more than she, but had to agree with her...VERY DISAPPOINTING!

Normally I will give an establishment a second chance, but this one will not get another chance. IMO, not worth the trip."}
{"text":"I'd come back again for the hot dogs. They are loaded up with toppings and messy to eat but delicious. The brisket sliders were dry and the BBQ sauces are underwhelming. I feel like one of the five sauces should be in your face spicy and it's only mild. The hush puppies with jalapeño are hard and bland. If you are looking for a good hot dog though come here! They are all beef too."}
{"text":"Deeeelicious! We had Crooked River cater our work lunch and it was LEGIT. The mac n cheese bar was great and all their meat is so tasty. I want to steal the cornbread recipe!  Honestly better than a lot of the BBQ joints in cleveland. The staff is super helpful and food is great so what else could you ask for?  We'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"Not worth it. Don't come here. Ever. Please don't even think about doing so. 

So let down by this place.
Got the pulled pork sandwich, mac and chz, and bourbon baked beans.

You want to talk about the driest, lukewarm pile of sad pork I have ever had. I had to drown it in sauce (which all taste the damn same) just to choke it down. You can tell it sat under a heat lamp for a few hours.

Mac & cheese? No. More like soggy noodles & cheese flavored water. They were so tasteless not even the crappy crushed saltine crackers on top wanted to be in it.

And these baked f*kn beans. Listen. They threw any beans they could find,  added some pork in it and tossed it around in some water. Then said *voila* slapped a baked beans name to it and figured no one would notice. NOTHING ABOUT THESE DAMN BEANS MADE THEM CLOSE TO BOURBON BAKED BEANS.

The staff is incompetent, and it's not their fault. You can just tell they were not trained properly or long enough. I can see why they have a craigslist ad for new management, because they have no leader. The shift manager tonight was as clueless as his staff. (Sunday, November 8th, 2015, at 6pm) 

The only reason. THE ONLY REASON this place deserves the one star I have to give is that they have Frost top root beer on tap. I love frost top root beer."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 brisket sliders, and greens. Food was pretty good but $7 got me 2 tiny sliders with minimal meat on each. Wouldn't pay more than $2 a piece for these again. Good food, but the prices are crazy."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork and it was good. The garlic mashed potatoes were ok, and the baked beans were dry and not that tasty. While the meat was good, the service was really slow and they delivered our order for 4 people in 5 different trips to our table. They did give us coupons for free sandwiches, but I do not see us going back."}
{"text":"I ordered brisket. It was SHREDDED instead of SLICED. So I had brisket strings for lunch. Slicing brisket against the grain is like BBQ 101."}
{"text":"Some of the worst BBQ I have had. 

Brisket is flavorless, overcooked, and no smoke flavor at all. Pulled pork was slightly better but still not enjoyable. Their mustard sauce isn't bad. I would avoid the rest. Sweet potato casserole was nothing but nuts and brown sugar. 

Only redeeming point was the corn bread."}
