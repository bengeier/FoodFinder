{"text":"Stopped by Sunday night to avoid the crowds of opening Friday/Saturday. I've been looking forward to this place opening for awhile, it is very close to my house. Was very happy with how it turned out. They have a great draft lineup, and a ton of bottles and cans to choose from as well. The mixed drinks are fun too and well thought out.

The food was good as bar food goes. Nothing too fancy, but I enjoyed my buffalo chicken pizza. I'm sure they will continue to tweak the menu. The service was really good too. 
Spent some time on the games as well. Good lineup to start. Played some Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter 2, Crusin' USA, Jurassic Park (Japanese version), and Area 51. Everything is free to play, and there are carts for you to put your food/beer on while you play. 

Overall, I was very impressed, especially for an opening weekend.

One suggestion, I found the lighting to be a little bit harsh. Maybe dim it just a tad, at least in some areas. 
Oh and I would love if you started a trivia night. :)"}
{"text":"Best arcade games in the valley! The staff is also super cool and really friendly. Super fun games to play for free and they hold game tournaments as well sometimes too which are loads of fun! 

Also, Chaco tacos. Any other bars sell them? Yea didn't think so."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The drinks are creative and innovative and they have a great selection of beers.  The staff is friendly and make the atmosphere pop.  Plus they have free play on arcade games!  The food is a great example of classic and modern bar food with something for everyone!"}
{"text":"This spot is so awesome! They have a great selection of beer and liquor. The bartenders really know their stuff and you can tell they're passionate about what they do. They have many arcade games and tons of board games. Great place to grab drinks with a date or with a big group of friends. I highly recommend the tater tots, they're crisp and warm but not too oily."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this place! The food was so good. I had the grilled cheese and he had the pizza; both plates were delicious and very filling! The staff was friendly and helpful with food suggestions. We had so much fun playing the games too. Perfect place for date night and hanging out with friends. We will definitely bring our out of  town guests here next week!"}
{"text":"Bonus Round is a really fun arcade bar with a video game and comic book theme. It's also right next store to All About Books and Comics, Stinkweeds, Halo, Frances, and Dutch Bros. They have a variety of affordable foods and ten craft beers on tap. They also have a huge variety of canned and bottled craft beer. Bonus Round has both Xbox One and Wii U consoles that you can play in a small living room resembling lounge area for free. They have some of the 90s classics like Mortal Kombat, NBA Jam, Street Fighter 2, and other popular arcades like Rampage, Duck Hunt, Joust, and Gauntlet. All the arcade games are free to play except for the 10 player team vs team game Killer Queen."}
{"text":"I've been to Bonus Round three times now, and have never had a negative experience. The first time I went after an episode of Survivor and the place was pretty quiet. The bartender was very attentive and was happy to add some soda to my cocktail when I mentioned it was too strong for me. The second time I stopped by in the middle of trivia night on Thursday. Even though I found practically the only empty seat at the bar, the service was very fast and friendly. The most recent time I visited was on a Thursday at 11pm. We were able to check out they're great supply of board games.

I would recommend Bonus Round to anyone who enjoys free arcade games and unique cocktails."}
{"text":"Every game is free to play, drinks are good, what more could you want?
Since every game is free to play, it does make some games that are intended to drain your pockets a little easy.
Drinks range from a little below average to pricey, but adding in the money saved from the arcade makes it well worth it."}
{"text":"I am going  to review the service then the atmosphere. I went a week after opening and it took over 20 minutes to get a drink. The bartender ignored me. A female server asked if I had been helped and I stated no. She got the attention of the bartender to advise I had been waiting. It still took another 5 minutes before I could order. I realize it was a Saturday but the bartender got drinks for other patrons who had waited less.  It was annoying and yet I still left a tip even thought my wait was substantial. The cocktails are good and the beer selection is excellent. My boyfriend got a IPA and was pleased. 

That being said. I did enjoy the atmosphere and It is really close to my house so I was excited when it opened. Nostalgia kicks in when you see all the video games they have.  I gave three stars because the video games are free. There are multiple types of games: shooting games, driving games and fighting games  My favorite Mortal Combat was there. It was a wait to play the game but was well worth it. 

I will try Bonus Round again and hope their bar service is better next time."}
{"text":"good when games are free but they made me $9 for a bloody mary that was too spicy to drink so when I complained they didn't want to switch it out or do anything"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers at very reasonable prices. Having a wide selection of old arcade games to play for free is an amazing bonus. They also have a bunch of board games, playing childhood games like Trouble with a beer in hand is a pretty cool experience (don't know why I had not tried it before). If they had a dart board I don't think I'd go to any other bar in the area. I had the quesadilla which was great as well. Definitely a comic book vibe going on but not overwhelming, there are old NFL Blitz, NBA Jam and other games for those who are less into that scene. I'm excited to go back and check out some of their mixed drinks as well as more beer, I think most people will find this to be a worthwhile experience even if it's just to stop by for a quick drink."}
{"text":"Came for opening night. In general, the bar has a really fun concept and friendly staff. We enjoyed ourselves despite the long wait for drinks and food, and our pizza order coming out incorrect. But it was opening night so we understood why it would be backed up.

Am I the only one who thinks the food was way over priced? We order a 4 cheese pizza for $10 and received a small personal sized pizza that looked like something I make in my kitchen at home. Not trying to be a downer here, but it was maybe a $5 pizza. I'm glad we weren't hungry because the bill would have been way too high. For $10 I'm expecting a little better.

Hope to come back once the opening rush dies down. Like I said, cool concept and fun atmosphere. Really enjoyed playing the games while we waited."}
{"text":"Free games, cheap drinks, friendly staff what more could you ask for?! This place is tyte."}
{"text":"Wow such an amazing lil gem !! The MOXXIS MULE IS BY FAR THE BEST DRINK IN THE AREA !!!  #17 at windsor was good till this happend !!!! Super cool chill and I can walk here easily. Super dooper nerdy but I'm a fan by far !  Fyi all games are free !!! Bye bye cobra its was fun but not my thang chicken wang no mo !! Haha have fun peeps n love"}
{"text":"This place was so so cool. Great deals on beer, fun munchie food like nachos made with tater tots, and all kinds of games.  We played Overwatch on Xbox for a little while while enjoying some sour beer.  All of the games are set on \"free\" mode so you can play as much as you like.  We went during happy hour so they had $1 off drafts.  There were some happy hour discounts on food as well.  It's in a cute little shopping center with a comic book store next door."}
{"text":"Best arcade bar I've been to in Phoenix - the games are free and the staff really helped me pick a drink that I'd like. Nice selection of board games, arcade games, drinks, and food!"}
{"text":"man how much fun did I have it was like I was a little kid again but I did not need to ask for quarters from my dad because all the games are free free free  played rampage street fighter they even had road warrior I had a heff called blue something It was amazing  tasted like blue berry they have a ton of local beer from AZ many of cocktail too  I like the grilled cheese dam good too not greasy at all you don't want your fingers to slip off the joy stick you know the bar tender was grate very knowledgeable of the menu he suggested were grate will be back very soon"}
{"text":"My favorite bar. Super chill atmosphere and great staff they're always so friendly. I recommend this bar to everyone I know and to everyone I don't know. They changed their taps pretty much every week and they always have a great selection of beers to try especially if you want to get into beer. Love this place"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed with this place. Didn't measure up to the hype. Half the games are out of order and food is too expensive. 6pm and we were the only patrons in the place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and had an absolute blast! The staff behind the bar were incredibly helpful with helping us choose a drink. These guys definitely knew their stuff. In addition to craft cocktails, they also have a wide variety of beers available, both draft and cans/bottles. I prefer lighter beer so the bartender suggested the Bonus Round Blonde which is brewed for them by SunUp Brewery, and it was exactly what I was hoping for. We also split an order of the fried pickles which were a bit on the spicy side for me, but delicious. The games are all on free play and the selection included some of my favorites like Centipede, Galaga, Mortal Kombat, and Jurassic Park (complete with hydraulic bench.) The only things I would change is to make the chalkboard with the drink selections a little more simplified, as there is a lot going on and it's kind of hard to take it all in. It also would have been helpful to have had physical paper menus to look at the food/drink offerings. This is an awesome new place run by some people who really know what they're doing. I look forward to coming back here and working my way through the rest of the games!"}
{"text":"The ghost pepper grilled cheese is fantastic!  Also tried a mint ale that was really different, but good.   They have a nice selection of beers and cocktails and they even have daily happy hour from 4-6."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy this spot.  The bartender was very nice, and service was good.  The beer selection...c'mon.  Put some craft lagers on tap...all ales.  As for the video games, there were at least 5 different ones that I tried to play that did not work.  I understand the video games are free to patrons, but they have to work.  Otherwise, they're taking up space."}
{"text":"Those totchos tho... it has fun free games and reasonable priced food and drinks.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I love Bonus Round. The staff is super friendly and they always have great beer on tap or in cans/bottles. It's a lot more chill and \"nerd\" focused then the other arcade bar in town, which is perfect. All the arcades are free so it makes for a good time without breaking the bank or having to stock up on tokens, you'll usually find me sucking at Galaga or challenging friends at NFL Blitz. They also have game tournaments from time to time which is also a blast. If you're looking for good drinks, free video games, and a relaxed atmosphere - cozy up here. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is not Dave & Busters.... Thank God!  Free... FREE old school video games!! Spy Hunter, Galaga, Centipede... and more! Classics!  Great food, awesome drinks and great atmosphere!  My wife will start to wonder since it's on my way home..."}
{"text":"Could this be the best palace in Phoenix to play retro  video games for free!!! Why YES! Yes it is.  I haven't played Joust in 20 years & I got a high score.  How neat is that?   While you are here and must try is the grilled cheese.   All I can say is wow!"}
{"text":"Cool little arcade bar in the Uptown area. Went on a Saturday evening and it was pretty packed but still able to get on some of the games. Not the biggest selection of arcade games but their beer and cocktail menu is stocked with tons on draft and bottles/can. Arcade games free along with Xbox games and board/card games. Beers and other drinks decently priced as well. Only down side was the racing game, one of the steering wheels didn't work and the teenage mutant ninja turtle arcade game wasn't on. Parking is scare during prime time hours. Other than minimal game selection and some not working, it's fun and something different than the norm to do."}
{"text":"I had the Grilled Cheese; Havarti Gouda Sourdough, with tots it was delicious I could had order three or six plates, but I didn't want to spoil for later dinner I had waiting at home. I went to the all about books and comics next door and I had no idea about Bonus round bar. I was with my film crew filming a pilot tv show and It was a great atmosphere people really seem to enjoy themselves. I will definitely go back with a couple of friends and hang out enjoy a chill friday night."}
{"text":"This place is rad. Free play on all the games. Good beer. Grilled cheese to die for. They also had some racing tournament going on...super fun. Will come back. Great arcade. Had a real \"locals\" vibe. Comic books on the tables."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is chill and low key.  The selection of arcade games was nice but my husband and I enjoyed playing some card games.  It was really neat that total strangers would walk around and jump into board games and card games with each other.  
While playing our card games we enjoyed some pizzas.  We got the Buffalo style pizza and the Smoked BBQ pizza,  both tasted great and would go well with any drink from the bar.  My husband was thrilled that they carried one of his favorite single malt whiskeys,  lagavulin!  The staff was friendly and made sure to keep our waters full and tend to our needs."}
{"text":"This bar is by far the best in the area! The staff is always friendly, helpful, and attentive. The food is definitely bar food but great for the price. The drinks are delicious and the beer list is relatively large and changes so there are endless options. They often have live music and the games are mostly free to play and there are numerous table top games and an Xbox with several games on it and customers can bring their own games. They have a fun-filled calendar with lots of events so there's never a dull moment at this place. This is a great place to go for a fun atmosphere and a great time."}
{"text":"Love the video games here! Go ahead and try the \"Bartender's Beer Choice\". You get to try a new unknown beer for a discount! The bartenders want to educate your about beers that might suit your personal preference. This option is the perfect opportunity to try something new and to find beers you might love! 

Love to end my night here with my friends. I definitely recommend coming here. The bartenders are also very nice. There's an awesome selection of beers on tap in bottles and cans. The mixed drinks are named after superheroes and villains. There are always fun events happening during the week such as talks from fun speakers, Geeks Who Drink, comedy nights, and local bands. I find out about what's happening on their Instagram account @bonusroundphx."}
{"text":"Fun Arcade Bar with great beer and mixed drink selections! Campfire Stout is hands down a mix of a yummy S'mores milkshake and beer! Casual, fun hole in the wall bar. Arcade games are free for all and they also have board games and cards. Would come again for a fun night out! Downside would be the games and size of the bar. It's a bit small and there aren't that many games, but if you don't mind crowds and waiting to play the arcade games and are just there for the beer and a fun time, then this is your dive! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Had a blast with friends here again last night. The staff is super cool here and the Full Restore is probably my new favorite cocktail ever. Hoping to come back on my birthday and take advantage of their new living room style console corner. Bonus Round also gets BONUS POINTS (heh) for playing Kung Fury and Turbo Kid on the projector. Those movies are my jam."}
{"text":"Great place to chill. Got hooked on the place now I'm a regular I love being able to sit and play arcade games"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, they have a great selection of craft beers, the staff is great and I love atmosphere. Brought back the inner kid in me playing video games, which are free to play by the way!"}
{"text":"Yayyyyy!!!! 

Video games - all you can play. 
Beverages - alcoholic and non. 
Food - bar food but done right. 
Music - some nights live other nights they just play good stuff. 
Trivia - Thursday nights. 

AWESOME DATE NIGHT SPOT! Of course I do love a good romantic date night too but when you just need some fun and don't want to change or make a reservation....well I'll be totally honest if you want to make your boyfriends day with a date night and he is a mega nerd ladies here is the spot! 

Servers are friendly and so are the people. Great atmosphere and all you can play games!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked I have never reviewed Bonus Round. I came here when it first opened and immediately loved it. All of the arcade games minus one are free and they strike the perfect level of nostalgia. I personally always go for Rampage, but that's just me. There are shooting games, Pac Man, racing games, really whatever your heart desires. Plus, there are board games which always gets a place points in my book.

I come for trivia usually, but regardless of the night, the bartenders are the nicest group of people. They make wonderful recommendations. They also make great drinks. The cocktails are unique and always delicious. They are strong so you've been warned. 

In addition to that, they have a brown bag special which is exactly what it sounds like. There are beers in brown bags that you pay to get a suprise beer. If you're not picky about your beer I highly recommend going this route."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Great selection of Beer and Cocktails. A must have is their Tatchos. Tater Tot nachos, with pulled pork. Cant beat the free arcade games to play with your friends. They have different events during the week, trivia, comedy and game contests. Sometimes they get a   brewery to coming in for a \"Tap Takeover\"."}
{"text":"Fantastic bar! All the arcades are free and they have a great selection. Was awesome getting down on some Area 51.

The craft beers were great and so are the cocktails. 
Personally liked the Moxie's Mule the most out of them but haven't tried them all.

The food was also really good! Perfect hand to mouth food where you either can have one hand on a joystick or your drink and the other just snacking. The toasted ravioli was great, especially.

Would definitely come back and can't wait till my next weekend to do so!"}
{"text":"Another great time at the Bonus Round..."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a tasty adult beverage and a snack while playing some great classic arcade games like NBA Jams, Galaga, and StreetFighter II. Also has regular console video game systems complete with an old 80's rec room type of setting to add to the ambience :-)"}
{"text":"Happened to stumble upon this hidden gem. They have free arcade games, a great variety of drinks and staff was friendly. We will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"Great spot!!!!!! Games are killer and the beers are super. Medlock peeps please visit!"}
{"text":"Great place great atmosphere and amazing beer! First time here and had a great time. Good conversation with the staff and the ambience was awesome. Will def be back to enjoy some of the other many craft beers they offer. Not to mention the selection of old school arcade and board games and did i mention the games are free!!! My new fav place to go love this place."}
{"text":"This  place is phenominal, not to mention it's in the neighborhood. You can't ever go wrong with free arcade game play and a great selection in board games.  On top of that, the drink menu is impressive and customer service is amazing. 
 Thank you for making this spot so awesome!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My friends and I came last night after going to Cobra. I'd never been, and it was way more my speed. It's like a divey-er cobra. Super comfortable with plenty of seating, cozy chairs with a TV you can play console games on, or board games at the coffee table. Free arcade games too!

 Drink menu is super creative. I had a Moxxi's Mule, basically a Moscow mule with green chili infused vodka and blueberries. Super yummy. They also have a drink called Fuck 2016 right now which was pretty good. I didn't try any of their food, it seems like pretty standard bar eats, but I'll try it next time I go.

 The staff was amazing! We were there till close (Midnight) and were the last group of people. They put on the music we wanted to hear and took pictures for us. It was really awesome. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The bartenders are so sweet! The drinks are great, they are worth it! I will be coming here more often, just for the drinks alone."}
{"text":"Free video games!!!

Kid friendly.. great place for mom & dad to have a beer while kids enjoy themselves playing free vintage arcade games for free. Lots of classic games, close to 20"}
{"text":"Sunday is the best time to go because of the free arcade games!! We had a blast! They are losing a star because there wasn't great service. You have to go to the bar to order everything on Sunday. But my goodness free arcade games on Sunday you can't beat that on SundayFunday!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to see what was new in this space. What a fun surprise! The staff was fun but we were the only ones in the place but it was a Wednesday at 5 or so. We chatted with the bartender and ordered some drinks. Great, inventive drink menu. 
We played some games, they are all FREE! I just wish there were a few more \"girly\" games like Pac Man, Frogger, Qbert or Donkey Kong. I knew a few of them but my hubby knew most. 
We ordered the sliders, tots and fried pickles. Not the best food. Tasted like frozen food thrown in the frier. It was edible but not really good. They did have fun nostalgic treats but we didn't try them. 
It would be a fun place for a group to hang out for an evening. Games (video and board) and great drinks. 
Work on the food and it will be great!"}
{"text":"**\"Warning... this review has been copy and pasted from Facebook, and I HATE Yelp, but these guys deserve all the five stars in the world. Just doing my duty to spread the barcade love!!\"**


I finally made it out to this place tonight and I'm truly in love with what these guys are doing for the community. They have a lot of heart and it really shows. We started out with a few craft cocktails that were expertly prepared and very impressive. The food prices are on the lower end, so we ordered a bunch and were not disappointed. The fresh veggies on the hummus plate were especially top notch! Rounding everything off with a few craft beers and some Galaga really made my night!

The best part about this place is that the owners are there and available. It's so nice to see a new business open and grow through the hard work and excitement of the guys at the very top. This is not a corporate hipster glam show, it's the real deal. A small business run by real dudes for the love of the gaming community. I'm excited to watch them learn and grow. Phoenix has a real gem in Bonus Round. Give them your money!!

**Oh, and Becky is cool as shit. Tip the shit outta her!!**"}
{"text":"IPA tasted awful.  Odd trivia event caused the venue to be flooded with sitting patrons.  Very few video games."}
{"text":"Great spot, some of the arcade cabinets are a little funky or take some love to get working. Maybe the bar was a bit understaffed, but service was mildly slow. Food and drinks were great!"}
{"text":"Small. Not a big game selection. No cocktail waitresses. Staff is unknowledgeable. They gave us Pepsi that was out. So we asked for something else and all of a sudden they didn't have any option of soda until the next day. I have worked at many restaurants and know that they are all individually packaged so not sure what that's about. The pepsi looked whiskey colored. They had an I don't care attitude but the main reason we were here was for games and the selection was very poor."}
{"text":"By far the best barcade I've been too (Although Joystick in ATL has a special part of my heart!), this place is amazing! Not sure where to begin...I guess the games? First off they have a Galaga cabinet, and not an emu or combo one...Just O.G. Galaga set for marathon mode. Then maybe 15 others, I really only played Galaga...Seem to recall NBA Jam, Joust, MK1, Jurassic Park, Ms. Pacman (Cocktail table version), some sniper game...There were more, feel like a TMNT was there. Think there is also an Xbox One...

No cover, at least on the nights I went (Which was M-Sat) and they have a Geeks Who Drink on Thursdays which is an awesome trivia group. Happy hour 4-7 as well.

What next...Oh yeah, the bar! It's covered in comicbook pages, it's gorgeous! First few nights I just placed the length of the bar seeing what they have, pretty sure people thought I was crazy. There is even free to read comics littered across the place that are donated from the shop next door (Also highly recommend). And the original art on the wall is great too! Speaking of the bar, it's beer/wine/liquor and very reasonable...I don't drink beer but looked like a great selection.  

The food is way too good for the price, I had the grilled cheese and tots one night and pork gordita another, fantastic both times!

I visited the other barcade in PHX while I was here, the place was pretty nice but didn't really jive with the crowd...Exact opposite here. I never felt like I was excluded, and even managed to have some teammates for trivia (Potent Potables!) that were easy to get along with. I forget the exact wording they use but if you're a true geek/nerd this is your home away from home.

Saved the best for last...The staff. Becky, Jacob and James were very personable and a joy to chat with. Hands down the best crew I met during my stay in Phoenix, gonna miss them.

Oh, and Trivia Pursuit cards at the bar to make you feel stupid...Cause F that game! I got 1,900,000 on Galaga there, my best ever...You should and try and beat it (Need to be Player 2)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here, one of my favorite places in Phoenix! The arcade games and board games in combination with the beer and drinks makes this a fun place to hang out 

Some arcade games are free. They added a 10 player arcade game which seemed pretty cool, though you have to pay to play that.

Beer selection at the bar is always great here, and the cocktails are sweet and girly just like how I like it lol.

I think they should expand their game board selection. There are a couple of cool games here like cards against humanity, splendor, catan, pandemic, and lanterns. They should try to add some new additions regularly."}
{"text":"GREAT BAR!!!! Have to say the overall theme and experience was awesome. The staff was super helpful and kind. While everyone waited in line they served waters to the crowd while we waited to get it.
The bartenders did a great job handling the crowd of people during the grand opening. The drink specials were so on point!!! \"Killing Joke\"
No issues using any of the games. They had all the best classics out on the floor. One of the best ideas they had was installing those two tier stands next to the games so you didn't have to have someone hold your beer while you played.
The have some excellent IPA's on tap, but when you go you need to try the drink specials.
Place is for sure a must see!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like arcade games and booze? Especially free to play! No coins needed. They have tons of board games to choose from as well. Plus, Nick is my favorite bartender so there's that! Oh and the food is great. Get the pork gordita. Go, go, go."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this bar for a few years now and cant suggest it enough to people. Situated in the corner of a strip mall off 1st ave and Camelback sits the perfect gaming bar.

A great stop after hitting All About Books and Comics which is in the same complex. You'll find a vast selection of nerdy specialty cocktails, many of which include a tasty gummy bear finish. Otherwise there's a full bar and many local beers and wines. 

The food is a bit over priced and mostly simple bar fare but it is quite tasty, the perfect pick-me-up after a long gaming session. Oh and it's definitely worth noting that all of the games are free, completely, and every single day. This means you can play hours of Guantlet Legends or Jurasic Park without breaking the bank like when you were a kid. Finally!

They also have a large selection of table top games that you can set up on any of their large assortment of tables. Or you can play a variety of consoles/games from the comfort of one of their couches. 

And if thats not enough for you, follow their Facebook page and join one of their tournament nights. Or come in on Thursday with a team of friends of Geeks Who Drink trivia night. You may even get lucky and get to try some local beers for free as their are often beer tasting going on. 

All in all a great place to bring a date, a group of friends, or even a corporate party. Drinks are a bit pricey but for all the free games you can handle, I'd say it's well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The bartenders are really nice and welcoming and you feel like you're a kid at the local arcade, except you're drinking good drinks and almost every game is free. Ya, free! There are even board games with big tables if you want to do something else. Good spot for larger groups even, 6-8 people are fine!"}
{"text":"Not my scene but if you're into old arcade games and cheap booze, this is your place."}
{"text":"A great addition to Uptown PHX. This place is a bit more chill and laid back than Cobra Bar in downtown (which is also great, just a different vibe). This place is more for true nerds and people into games, Cobra Bar has a bit more of a club vibe. 

Bonus Rounds food isn't haute cuisine or anything, but it'll get you by while you play some classic arcade games. I love that they have board games too. Many of the best board games can run $50+, so this is a great place to check a game out before buying it."}
{"text":"We stumbled across Bonus Round a few months ago on accident and have been back now a number of times. The strip mall it's in doesn't look like much, but trust me, the bar is fun and unique. On top of the free arcade games, board games and console, they actually have an interesting drink menu with custom cocktails and from what my husband affirms, a decent beer menu. 

The only negative is that at any given time at least a few of the arcade games don't work. Yes they're free, but when you sit down with your drink excited to battle your husband in a California dreaming car race, only to find that your steering wheel doesn't turn, disappointment abounds. Even if there was just a small sign they could put on those having issues, it would set better expectations. 

That aside, I'd highly recommend Bonus Round if you're looking for a laid back, neighborhood bar with a twist!"}
{"text":"Great bee, food, games, and service.  Do yourself a favor and check them out!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Totally loved this little neighborhood bar. Its not often that I go to bars, but when i heard about this spot I asked my girl to go with me and try it out. The drinks are refreshing, and the games are quite rare. the fact that you don't have to pay to play them is even cutter. They had Ms Pac-man, Street Fighter II, Jurassic park, Rampage, and quite a few more. It's a bit hard to find and i would say they need better signs. but all in all I would love to take my BF there and know that he would enjoy it as much as I did."}
{"text":"I had been anticipating the opening of Bonus Round after hearing that a new \"barcade\" was in the works in the midtown Phoenix area. After all, nothing goes together better than drinking and video games! I decided to wait a few weeks to let the initial hype die down so I could fully appreciate the experience, and I have to say, IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT! Last night I made my first appearance and felt right at home when I walked in. 

The interior has a very raw but welcoming feel with classic arcade games scattered about, and handwritten menus/drink lists on chalkboards hanging from the walls. My first dilemma was what drink to order first: the beer selection is very impressive, but the handcrafted cocktails cleverly named after video game themes appealed more to the kid in me. Naturally I ordered the Barrel Roll, a whiskey based cocktail with ginger root. AMAZING. I wasn't very hungry but after spying hand battered deep fried pickles on the menu, I decided to treat myself to a little snack. ALSO AMAZING (with a little bit of a spicy kick as well).

After ordering my second cocktail, the Dry Heat (a spicy tequila based drink, also amazing) I decided to try my hand at some arcade games. First of all, I loved the fact that everything is free play. It's a brilliant business decision, because it made me want to stay longer and that equals more money spent on more drinks and food. The game selection is pretty decent and it was relatively easy to play all the games I wanted despite the large crowd. Everyone seemed to be considerate of letting others play.

The staff was incredible; our bartenders (Johnny and the other gentleman whose name I never caught) were both very helpful in helping us select our drinks all evening, and answering our million questions regarding different beers, cocktails and spirits. That kind of attentiveness to the customer in that busy environment does not go unnoticed and I was extremely impressed!

To wind this long review up, I'll just say that last night was one of the most fun nights I've had in Phoenix in a while and I will 100% without a doubt be back very soon as I'm very determined to beat my Spy Hunter record!


My only suggestions would be to turn the music up just a bit to create more of an atmosphere; nothing crazy loud, obviously you want to be able to have a conversation. At one point when I was killing it at Galaga a really good song came on and I remember thinking \"I wish this was a little louder, I'd SO be in my zone right now\". And second, use that projector for something amazing! Other barcades I've been to will project movies or video games on the wall for customers to play consoles like playstation or xbox on a giant screen (or wall in this case)."}
{"text":"My new favorite Bar. I'm kind of a nerd and love Video Games. Not only are the Arcade games free, they have an Xbox One, board games and books! 
MANY great beers in the $4 range. Where else can you get a Lagunita's for $4? 
Featured Cocktails are video game and comic book based (and they can make anything else you want). 
Try the 'Plasma Grenade' or the 'Full Restore' you won't be disappointed.
I personally enjoy this place a bit more than Cobra (I also give Cobra 5 stars) because the atmosphere is more my style."}
{"text":"Although they had a great happy hour the Bonus Round wasn't that spectacular. Immediately when entering the place felt sterile, perhaps it was the overly bright lighting. The games were old school and free and we enjoyed playing a few of them. 

The food was horrible, we got the grilled cheese and tots and the fried pickles. I wouldn't recommend any of them, the tots were fried dried bits and the pickles had a chewy coating.  3 stars for the moxy mule cocktail, it was made with green chili vodka and it was pretty stellar.

Hopefully things improve once they have been open longer. I'd hate to see another business fail in this location."}
{"text":"Is it Thursday evening? If so, you should be here playing trivia with some of the best trivia players in the area. Get here early or you won't have a chair or table! Bring your smartest friends, but not too many, as the teams can't be more than six players. 

Order some drinks (I prefer the cider here), order some munchies (the hummus dip is yummy, so are the tater tots), and get down to business playing. 

The emcee will keep things lively and moving along. There'll be a couple of intervals when you will learn the standings. If you are among the best, your team name will be announced, so when choosing your name, make it a good one. RUN, do not walk, when the round has a bonus and the first correct answer wins.

At the end of the night, if you didn't win trivia, you can always try to win a game of ms pacman (old school style) against friend, and if you have drunk too much, take a Lyft or Uber ride home! 

Remember, Thursday night, trivia. Be there."}
{"text":"In case you're late to the party, Phoenix is currently undergoing a barcade renaissance. With the giant chains in this industry on the decline, entrepreneurs are taking advantage of our nostalgia to deliver a combination of childhood pastimes and adult beverages.

Perhaps the first thing you'll notice about Bonus Round is the stark contrast to many of the valley's similar establishments. Barcades tend to be dark and narrow, but this one is broad and brightly lit. This decision in atmosphere brings attention to the benches for communal seating, board games, and food. I haven't had anything from their limited menu, but snacks like ice cream sandwiches are welcome, and personal pizzas are a plus. Because I don't come to places like these for food, I can only assume they add to the experience. 

The drink menu is actually very carefully thought out. As a beer lover, their acumen for choosing the right brews is much appreciated. They even had a custom beer made by Sun Up! In addition to this, there's a small but ambitious cocktail menu prepared by their very cool bartenders. 

When I say \"ambitious\", it is arguably to a fault. At 9-10 bucks a pop, it's competing with places like Hanny's, Valley Bar, and Sidebar...the list of above-average lounges to get a decent cocktail goes on. What I have had was not *bad*, but not something that struck me as overtly premium or even appropriate for the setting. Quite frankly, I don't think you can really get away with these in what looks and feels like a cafeteria, as I have no reason to prefer dropping beaucoup bucks on booze here over a dozen other spots. You have a casual atmosphere and food menu, so play to that strength. 

The gaming itself is pretty cool, and they've committed to keeping them free! They've got the staples, like NBA Jam, NFL Blitz, and Street Fighter. Some other selections are great, like Silent Scope. Others are duds that haven't aged well, like Jurassic Park which is more fun to gawk at and pose in than play. Or their old-school Gauntlet game, which is really just a half hour button mashing session once you have unlimited lives. Overall, the selection does enough to keep you having fun for a couple hours, which is good. 

I think that overall, this is the barcade for nerds. I can envision myself downing a nice draught while I play something like MTG on your tables. There seems to be great opportunities to please gaming purists in a bright and relatively quiet space like this. I'd come here again whenever I'm in the mood to play games with close pals or a date. I would not come here to get rowdy on a weekend night, mingle with new people, or imbibe fine liquors. Still, I am happy for this addition to the valley and would be content with coming back."}
{"text":"The drinks here are great and they taste fresh. I order the chicken quesadilla and tater tots, you can tell they are from the frozen section of any grocery chain, but it did taste delicious though.

I found the lighting in the room to be too dark to see other peoples faces and to view the environment. I would suggest upping the lighting a bit so people can see in front of them.

The game selection is okay, nothing exciting expect for rampage, but it does get dull pretty quickly. Generally people here are loud and can be annoying for others who want to enjoy themselves in solitude while enjoying a nice cocktail or something."}
{"text":"I went here last night and it was so much fun. Awesome beer selection, all the games are free and the food was pretty good too! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Trivia night is Thursday night.  This is truly a place for people who like to play games.

This bar doubles as a game room with old-style video game machines lining the walls. If you remember Pac-Man, you can play here for free.

They also have a large selection of board games you can play.

Their beer selection is good with revolving beers on tap. They have enough bottled beers to satisfy most people's tastes. They also serve a number of creative cocktails including some cider-based ones. 

The appetizers are filling and reasonably priced but not recommended as a full meal deal.

If you come for the trivia you will be competing against some hard core geeks who know something about almost everything from pop culture to classical literature and agronomy to zoology. 

The trivia master of ceremonies is able to keep the game moving, and is able to grade your answer sheets and give out prizes with humor and natural enthusiasm. 

Go for trivia night and have a blast."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Free games, diverse drink selection, and the food was good. Would definitely spend alot of time here if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place to stop by for a drink! This place has a good selection of FREE arcade games that will keep you entertained and if you get sick of those they have a huge collection of board games as well. The bar is decorated with comic book covers and the lighting is dimmed which provides a really cool atmosphere. There's an over head projector streaming twitch onto one of the walls, which just adds to the unique vibe. They have an awesome selection of craft beers (even an off brand of Dogfish Head which you don't see that commonly). If your looking for a great low key bar where you can drink delicious beers and play old throwback arcade games- this is your spot."}
{"text":"I'm glad I came back to this place! I went when it first opened and it seemed like they were still getting their footing, but this place is super awesome now! Free arcade games, reasonably priced drinks and best of all it doesn't feel like a nightclub like the other barcade I've been to! Really cool selection of board games as well. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"So we went to Bonus round last weekend and this is still on my mind. We ordered fried zucchini, and I can't remember if the menu said fried or baked but it was the most horrible fried zucchini I've ever had. They said it was because they don't have a fryer so they put it in the oven. But the zucchini was soooooo mushy I ate one and took it back to the bar and said I can't eat this. Our other food came out a pizza and some pulled pork tater tots. Both were not good. Pizza was disgusting none of the ingredients were baked in. And the tots were just not good, the tots weren't cooked all the way and the salsa was straight from a jar. We took ALL the food back. 

I don't hop on here at all to give bad reviews because I believe in buying local and I love Phoenix I'm a native. But this food was just straight up not good. Just go for the drinks and games."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town? This is a must stop! I had a great time and ended up playing NBA Jam until the wee hours. The crowd was really friendly and invited us to play this large multi player game. It was a ton of fun, lots of beer choices and if I ever go back to Phoenix, I'll be visiting this bar."}
{"text":"Pros:

1. The games are free. That is awesome assuming the place isn't too busy. They have a small, but decent, selection of arcade games to choose from including a Mortal Kombat game (FTW!!!). 

2. They have beer....said beer is decently priced. 

3. They have happy hour.... who doesn't like happy hour? 

4. Their staff are generally friendly. 

5. They have trivia night on Thursdays at 7 pm and it is free to play.

6. The Golden Banana..... a beer cocktail that is fabulous (think chocolaty beer mixed with fruity flavors....it sounds weird, but it' really good). 

7. The atmosphere is fun and their mural on the wall is fabulous!


Cons:

1. If they are busy, service is hard to come by. 

2. Most of their cocktails have been just ok.... I haven't come across any cocktails (save my beertail (?) discussed in the Pros) that I would order again off their specialty cocktail menu. 

3. The trivia is a 'Geeks Who Drink' trivia night, which is a bit less fun than the original trivia nights you can find in other bars (not really the bar's fault, but you know).

4. Their food is a bit lack luster. It's supposed to be sort of 'grimy' I guess...their menu has things like grilled cheese and tater tots and choco tacos on it. I tried their gordito and it was fine, but not something I would get again. 



Try them out, there's really nothing to lose."}
{"text":"Bonus round is a great time. I came here with a few coworkers and we all shared the same thoughts: great drink selection, fun games and a good looking menu.

We didn't order any food but the menu had some good options on it. The beer selection was great! A lot of micro and craft brews available and the happy hour prices were spot on.

The staff was outgoing, friendly and helpful. Not much more you can ask for.

The game selection was fewer than I had imagined but they did just open up recently so I'm sure with time, they will add more.

Looking for something to do one night? Stop by this spot, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Bar!!
The staff is amazing! The drinks are varied and great! The games are free!! And the food is awesome! 
Great atmosphere and great people! :) 
I recommend without reservation!"}
{"text":"Went in on a trivia night. Their drinks were expensive but good. I like the free arcade games they had available. Bartenders were pretty friendly and they had a good crowd when we were there. Overall, I had a good time and met some new people."}
