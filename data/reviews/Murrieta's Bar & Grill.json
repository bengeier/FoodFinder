{"text":"Really nice atmosphere; Busy but great service.
I ordered the tuna salad as recommended on yelp. But I don't really into that, but it's a healthy choice and the new source is amazing"}
{"text":"Superb staff and great dining experience. Super clean to and accurate when you take Reservations!!   Saturday nights awesome bands come play that are classy but get up and groove!!! come on down on a weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm defiantly taking my special BF to this in may!! for a nice romantic dinner!! yummy"}
{"text":"This use to be my stomping grounds when I lived in Calgary & I have to say it hasn't changed (which is a good thing). The food & service is still fantastic. We stayed a bit for the live band in the evening, but was disappointed at how long the band took a break. We were on a high & enjoyed the music in the lounge, but left after more than 30 minutes of waiting for the band to go on again."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar....

Came here for drinks with a few folks.  Service was very very very slow, drinks were OK.  Will consider trying the restaurant, but won't go back to the lounge if I'm the one choosing where to go...."}
{"text":"This is definitely a romantic restaurant. It's in a great location off Steven Ave in a really nice old building and the live piano player is amazing. The food was...meh. We tried the crab cakes (terrible), seafood chowder, lamb, and duck confit pasta. It's not that it was bad but it was very bland and after a $200 bill my boyfriend and I both agreed that we would've got a better meal at our local pub. They have a really nice bar though if you're looking to go for a few cocktails and some live music."}
{"text":"Absolutely delectable! Great service, beautiful restaurant! We had the daily fresh catch cod on the patio with a glass of wine. Lovely lunch! Will defiantly visit again when downtown :)"}
{"text":"My friend told me to try this place and after having dinner here I can say that m satisfied with their service. Great customer service and wine & food were just amazing."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today. I'll start off by saying that this used to be my favourite restaurant when Ned Bell was still around and I used to go a couple of times a month. Their lamb meatball spaghetti was to die for as well as their banana cream pie.. but then shortly after Ned left, the standards start slipping. The food and service wasn't as good. And to top things off, the person answering the phone for reservations was borderline rude.  So I stopped going and never looked back. It's been about 4-5 years now.. at least.  Recently a friend of mine lunched there and had good comments about it so I decided to give it another shot.

I was pleasanty surprised at how things have turned around. The service today was actually really good. I was actually impressed there were about 8 staff serving the tables at lunch service.  That's probably twice the number that I'd ever seen in all the times I've been there in the past. Granted, today the restaurant wasn't full (only the dining area was mostly full) due to it being Easter Monday. When I called to make reservations, the person who answered the phone was polite and friendly. And I thought it was a nice touch they called this morning to confirm my reservations.

As for the food, the lamb meatball spaghetti with roasted garlic tomato sauce was just as good as I had remembered it. The spaghetti was cooked to perfection. It just brings back such good memories. I'm glad they have turned things around. I'll definitely be back for my favourite dish. 

For dessert, I had the baked alaska with bananas foster. It was ok.. a little on the sweet side.. I loved the bananas though and they were as good as they used to be back in the day.

All in all, I'd definitely say the service today was top notch. The prices on the menu are really reasonable.. I was so surprised after all these years. They are practically comparable to Milestones. I'd go to Murrietas any day over Milestones. I just haven't been these recent years because of my past experience. But my experience today totally changed my mind."}
{"text":"After our experience at Trib (or Tribune) for dinner, we were so pleased with the GREAT service for our dessert here.  

Hostess quickly approached and asked if we wanted the lounge or restaurant.  Told her we were just there for dessert and she said they would be happy be seat us wherever we wanted. The lounge was pretty and loud as they have a live band on Friday nights.  So we sat in the restaurant.  Was really nice to experience the live music, but still be able to hold a conversation.

Waitress quickly came and indicatated she would bring us dessert menus right away and she knew we were just there for dessert.  She was patient, gracious and VERY helpful.  I really don't like waiters that say 'everything is good' and she helped guide us to desserts we would really like.  She didn't say anything was bad, but asked a few questions and then made some recommendations.  I had planned to order the chocolate soufle, but she disuaded me.  And after she described it to me I realized I really wanted the Baked Alaska (which by the way you should share as it is REALLY good but very very rich).  My hubbie thought his creme brulee was some of the best he had had in years (and he is a tough critic).

Even the coffee passed muster.  My bro in law owns a coffee roastery and his very very fussy. And while they felt the beans were just okay, it was fresh brewed and hot.  Plus, the waitress was quickly able to answer their question on who supplied their coffee.  

Wish we had gone here for dinner, as well as dessert. Next time we'll forgo the people watching and have a GREAT dinner."}
{"text":"Our first visit was on Boxing Day, and it didn't disappoint! Food came out piping hot, staff was very attentive, and the ambiance was great. I highly recommend. Try the calamari too, the bit of olive and chickpeas on top were unexpected, but really tasty."}
{"text":"Went looking forward to enjoying a great dinner with my sister. Arrived at the top of the stairs to 2 hostesses and a host. The lounge was virtually empty. One of the hostesses asked whether we had reservations. We had. The host indicated which table we were to be seated at. I found it strange that we were taken past the dining room (it was only half full) and through the empty lounge. She then seated us at a small table around the very back of the lounge. We were surrounded by empty tables. I was surprised and disappointed. I noticed that other tables near us had been set so it was likely to be a busy night? After we ordered wine, 4 staff came over to our area and began moving the tables around us, removing the table settings and making a lot of commotion. They even moved one table within inches of where we were seated. I was incredulous and was about to ask whether we could be moved but didn't want to create a scene as I don't see my sister that often and we had already had drinks. The crab cakes we ordered were tiny; I would liken them to loonie size. I ordered the halibut in a lemongrass broth. I had to search for the halibut as it was hidden under a mound of some sort of vegetables. The halibut was so small it had to be maybe 4 ounces? What a terrible \"fine dining experience.\" I will never go back. When I looked into the dining room upon leaving, of course it was still not full. Unbelievable. The only positive about the experience was that our waitress was lovely and my sister did indicate that her curry dinner was very good."}
{"text":"Always a great choice in downtown Calgary. Went last week for a third time  and they never fail to impress.  Food selection and taste is awesome, staff are super nice and professional.  Had the steak and seafood - lived it!  Tempura prawns are to die for.  Good wine list.  Needed a cab after an affordable dinner."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly and have never been disappointed.

My wife and I had our first date here, and so we've made it a yearly tradition.

But it's not just sentimental, and we don't just go on our anniversary. We come here whenever we're in the mood for a good glass of wine (huge selection and never a bad choice in the bunch), and some genuinely good food. Murrieta's is as good as anything in town -- but it's not temperamental. It's consistently good food & service.

When we have guests from out of town, this is where we bring them for the steak and the atmosphere. I'll go for the rare-seared tuna or the bouillabaisse. It's one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Rib eye.  I've been back a few times now, but my first time here when I had the rib eye was excellent for a non-steak house.  I've also had a fish dish as well as their appetizers and desserts and all portions have been great.

Try to get a seat in the courtyard if you can, especially on a nice day."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of experiencing Murrietta's for a third time for our annual Christmas party. This time was different though because we had the whole restaurant booked out. The place is beautiful, the service is excellent and the food is great. Last year our party was at the riverside cafe, as great as the riverside cafe is, I may have to say that Murtietta's won me over. We had a variety of appetizers and the beef carving station. The whole experience was 5 star!!! Excited to have our party there next year."}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere.  Almost feels like your somewhere in Europe.  I had the veal medallions and they were not overcooked as they usually are. Prices were decent for a classy spot.  Good spot for a date"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on multiple occasions with my company and the service is amazing.   I had the Ahi Tuna and it was pretty good...a little too salty for my liking but the presentation was great.  The waiters were very attentive and made sure we were having a good dining experience.  Wine selection was decent.  I'd recommend coming here for business gatherings.  Good atmosphere and lighting in their center vaulted ceiling dining area (natural lighting)"}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Murrieta's Bar & Grill. My boyfriend and I definitely enjoy the dining experience here. 

Murrieta's has an incredible ambiance! They have a pianist who plays their grand piano during dinner time, which I think is awesome! This place has a modern and classy feel to it, definitely more upscale. The dim lighting, exposed brick walls and table arrangement makes the dining experience more intimate.

This restaurant is great for both couples and large groups. I've only dined in their bar area, but the actually dining area looks quite nice as well. The place is quite spacious and I'm quite sure they can accommodate pretty large groups (10-15 +).

Food wise, I would definitely recommend their pastas. Both times we've been here my boyfriend ordered their pasta (first time was the Lamb Meatball Spaghetti and the second time was the Scallop and Prawn Fettuccini) and it was definitely made well. The pasta was cooked perfectly (it was not too soft/soggy and not underdone) and the taste was phenomenal. 

The first time I was here I ordered their 10oz Striploin medium rare with their black truffle butter and it was delicious. It was cooked just right. Not to mention the truffle butter which I definitely enjoyed. The second time coming here I ordered the Westcoast Miso Hot Pot. To be honest I was a bit disappointed in this dish. The seafood didn't seem as fresh and vibrant as I'd like and the presentation was a bit lacking. I honestly expected the order to come out of the kitchen in a steaming pot. The taste of this dish was different, but I was never a big fan of miso. 

For dessert we ordered a pumpkin cheesecake which was absolutely delicious! The proportion of pumpkin to cheese was just right, which definitely enhanced the cake. I'm not usually a fan of the pumpkin cakes, but I really liked this one. And the serving size was perfect for two people to share. 

The service here is good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and would like to go back during the summer and eat on their patio! 

Chow for now!"}
{"text":"Went here on a saturday night. Incredible interior unlike no other bland banal place in this city. Asked for a caesar. Weak as fuck. Asked for some scotch, charged precisely by the ounce and with no double/trip.quad discount(booooooo) also served in a douchey glass. Bartender was a good guy, but he was the only one behind the bar ON A SATURDAY NIGHT. Place full of cougars and their bored assed husbands. Decent cover band playing covers. Oh, and there were TVs inside this historic bar. Yes. TVs. Playing sportscenter. What the hell is wrong with bars these days. 

It's a pretty typical west coast canadian place: expensive, unnecessary tvs, weak drinks, and short staffed.

The patio looks cool, however."}
{"text":"Murrieta's is and probably will always be one of my favorite restaurants. I had the privilege at my previous job to dine here quite often so I've been able to try pretty much their entire menu :)

A few colleagues and I headed here for an early lunch on a sunny day and got to sit on their patio that overlooks Stephen Ave. I've actually never sat on the patio before so I was excited to people watch and enjoy some delicious food.

I went with my favorite - Scallop and Prawn fettuccini without chorizo. The garlic butter sauce is sprinkled with fresh grated parmesan and red chilies to give it a nice kick. And the scallops and prawns are cooked perfectly as are the noodles.

The hustle and bustle of the lunch crowd down Stephen Ave is really fun to watch and being able to see from a different angle was awesome. Since the patio is narrow, you're sitting like you would at a bar so if it works well if you're with another person or two but it's probably not ideal for a big group. 

Another tip - since you're sitting up higher and the railing doesn't provide much shielding so be careful if you're wearing a dress/skirt or else you'll give the people below a glimpse of your underoos lol"}
{"text":"Terrible service and food! I went last night with 11 people in our party. We had made reservation. First they wanted to seat us at 2 different tables when we got there.. that took a few minutes to fix.. then we were seated and waited for 30 minutes for our first drinks.. which was just 3 bottles of wine and 3 mixed drinks!  We also had ordered appetizers  at that same time ... 1 hour and 30 mins later we got one basket of bread for our whole table!  The appies 10 mins after that!
The food arrived after 2 hours and was awful!  What was described on the menu was not was on our plate.  Food was either bland or to spicy and cold. $$$$ for Nothing! Don't waste your time UNLESS your going for coffee, drinks and dancing...The BAND was great!! (dance floor could be bigger).  Sad business in a awesome building.  Those who are giving the 5 STARS work there!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Murrieta's never let's me down. The service is always on point and pleasant and the food always exquisite. It doesn't matter what i order i always thoroughly enjoy my meal. A good place to go with a group as there is something for everyone and you will always hear patrons exclaiming to others that they \"simply must try this!\". Murrieta's has been a staple in downtown Calgary for years and there's a reason."}
{"text":"This place use to be one of my favorites at least would go 2 times a week with clients
Haven't been there for a while and I've noticed a big change service is extremely slow
What I don't get the management and waiters/waitresses should know our break is from 12:00-1:00PM 
Took 30 minutes to order drinks, and got my food 12:45
They use to have complementary bread but NOT anymore 
Food is OK, service NOT so good
Won't be going back there as I use to, since there is lot's of  other good places on Stephen Ave."}
{"text":"We went here for The Big Taste festival on  a Friday night. Our experience was pretty average.

The dining area in Murrietta's is beautiful. It looks like you're sitting in an old courtyard. However the service didn't match the setting. Our server was friendly but everything seemed to take sooooo long to get to our table. It was extremely slow. 

We ordered the big taste menu. He soup was good but obviously nothing at good because I can't remember what it was:S. We got an order of the Steelhead and an order of the Short Rib. Both dishes were decent. However kind of uninteresting that both dishes came with the same sides (risotto and veggies). For dessert we got one of each of the offerings. The bread pudding was dry and unappealing. The chocolate cake was really good, it redeemed the meal a bit.

I'm giving Murrietta's the benefit of the doubt that maybe they just were not ready for the Big Taste menu. However that's not really a good excuse. Our time at the restaurant was mediocre, waiting forever at a restaurant always puts a damper on things.

Better luck next time:)"}
{"text":"Best cob salad I have had in a long time... Add the grilled chicken it's fantastic.  Service as always was over the top."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at Murrieta's.  I know the restaurant has a good reputation, but do not come here with a large party.  Service was slow; food was terrible; and I got sick within an hour after leaving.  

First and last time I will ever come here."}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed. The restaurant looks great and is a big, open and bright space. The lounge though is quite dark. The balcony is great for people watching as it faces Stephen's Avenue. 
They currently have appetizers on special for $5, so we tried these. I expected more though, looking at the pictures of their regular food. Most of it was deep fried and not very flavorful, the spicy sausage was not too bad. Portions are a little small. The waitress was a nice and friendly person, but hard to get her attention. We had to wait quite long, glasses were empty and we had to ask \"could we please order food?\". I hope it was only because they were short on people that day.
Overall I don't have a strong desire to go back to this place, maybe in the summer to sit on the balcony."}
{"text":"As is my wont, when in Canada, have a bison steak. Did not disappoint.  Off the charts good."}
{"text":"We LOVED this place.  When we were walking on Stephen Avenue we looked up to find a small patio upstairs.  After searching around the corner on 1st st, there it was.  The patio though closes early so I was a bit disappointed.   The atmosphere you can't go wrong.  I loved the seating arrangement.  The service was impeccable.  

We had to go for a second time after our night at Pulcinello's.  This time we had dessert.  The bananas foster was out of this world.  The ice cream wasn't running and the toppings weren't drenched.  just perfect.  I know there is a location in Edmonton on Whyte Ave.  I don't know if it would be the same experience.  Who knows?  But I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it is always great no matter the occasion.  I've had birthday parties there and they are great with big groups.  Today was a  little simpler, just some drinks on the patio.  It is the perfect patio for enjoying the sights and sounds of Stephen Avenue... Especially during Stampede."}
{"text":"My first experience here was good. I was impressed by the decor and service.

This restaurant blew me out of the water my second go around. I went with a party of 9. My friend recommended I request a table in their courtyard under their sky roof. Wow, I don't know too many places where you can eat under a sun roof. I love the feel of the restaurant. There's red bricks with fenced windows outlining the main dining area.

The service was to perfection. Bobby took good care of my friends and I. He didn't hesitate to make recommendations on wines, entrees, and pairings of drinks with our food. I would have to say this is one of the best services in my dining experience.

The food is amazing. Even to the small detail of the dessert, which I feel like many restaurants set aside. You have to try their Sticky Toffee Pudding. 

I'm going to go as far as to say this is the best restaurant in Calgary. Prime location (epicentre of downtown Calgary). Top class service. Stupendous ambience. 

I'll dare someone to tell me another place that encompasses all this in one restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and food.   I had the lamb burger for lunch with a butter leaf salad side.  Both were awesome.   My wife had the beef burger and fries.   I helped her with the fries as they were delish!  Great time!"}
{"text":"We went to Murrieta's for some prosecco and dessert in the lounge. I have to say I really enjoyed the interior and feel of the lounge area. I liked that you could look out the windows and people watch while still being in a nice atmosphere. 

All three of us ordered a different dessert dish to share: pumpkin cheesecake, eggnog crème brule and an apple crumble. 

The pumpkin cheesecake and eggnog crème brule were very good but the apple crumble was disappointing. When it showed up at our table it had about a half cup of dry granola on top and we had to scoop off half the bowl to get to the apple part. When our server came over to check up on us we asked her if that is what it was supposed to be like and she wasn't sure but replaced it with two scoops of tiramisu and espresso gelato, which was amazing."}
{"text":"After an embarassing evening of poor service, you cannot imagine how refreshing it was to have dessert & coffee at Murrieta's.

When we arrived we were at our wit's end. We needed something to cheer us up and sure enough Murrieta's delivered!

We were seated at the PERFECT table, with the PERFECT chairs, at the PERFECT distance from the piano bar. We were greeted by our FANTASTIC waitress who confidently recommended the lemon cheesecake. She gave us the Coles Notes on the pastry chef and went off into the back to prepare our coffee while we made up our minds. We took her advice and ordered the Lemon cheesecake, along with a cheese plate and a variety of specialty coffees.

The coffees were DELICIOUS but nothing compared to the cheesecake. This woman KNEW what she was talking about!!! The lemon cheesecake was TO DIE FOR and the service we got was IMPECCABLE. The cheese plate was delicious as well, and we spent a couple hours just catching up without being bothered even once.

Our waitress' timing was perfect throughout the course of the entire evening; she checked on us at the perfect times, she brought the bill at the perfect time, and she left us alone at the perfect times!

I was SO impressed with Murrieta's at the end of the night that I'm thinking of booking round 2 later on this week. This place really set the mood for the way our night SHOULD have gone from the get-go. Thank goodness for Murrieta's...they officially saved the day :)"}
{"text":"What a joint!
My gal and I have darkened their doorstep on a number of occasions--for just drinks, as well as for the whole shebang--and it's never once disappointed!
Drinks:
The frequent live music courtesy of either a small 3 or 4 piece or their sensational piano man (who, for a small tip, will play anything you throw at him--although my appetite for Billy Joel does play to his strengths) always entertains.  Feel free to dance if the music takes you there!  Wine and beer selection is vast, and even the lower tier offerings are thoughtful and interesting rather than just being \"economical\".
Sitting along their balcony in the summer is nearly an unbeatable spot to watch downtown shenanigans--particularly during Stampede.

Dinner:
I've eaten from their frequent features menu--usually highlighting the fruits of a particular harvest season--and never gone wrong; but my default is their beef tenderloin.  For a joint that doesn't have the word \"Steak\" or \"Chophouse\" in their name, they certainly know their way around a grill.
The dining room--if you choose to eat on that side--is also pleasantly dramatic."}
{"text":"Stopped in with friends for drinks after dinner. So glad we did.

Murrieta's was busy but we were seated at a table within minutes. Our waitress took our drink order promptly. She came by all evening and always replenished us quickly.

They had a live band so it was loud but they played great music. Some current music as well as some 90's beats. Yeah! We stayed till closing and had a great time.

Drinks were great. Service excellent and atmosphere was awesome. Will be back again and next time for more than drinks."}
{"text":"It turns out that finding a nice place to eat before 5pm on a weekend, downtown, is quite a tall order. So too, is the Murietta's sign, which is a bit hard to spot from street level.  Once we walked upstairs, though, the atmosphere was lovely, especially under the giant skylight in the courtyard.
The wait staff was also fantastic, attentive and proactive.  For example, we asked about some allergies as they pertained to appetizers and when she came back later, for entree orders, she said \"Was the egg allergy yours? Is there anything else I can make note of for the kitchen?\" and she was helpful in suggesting side-dish swaps.
All that said, the food was mediocre and came with quite a price tag.  I had the Westcoast Cioppini, which had gigantic lobster claws and a healthy amount of seafood in it, however the seafood was the only thing driving the dish.  The sauce and pasta didn't contribute anything at all.  My spouse had the seared tuna and felt that it was fine, but not amazing.  Our friend had a gigantic wrap, which was quite reasonably priced and quite good.
All in all, the setting and service lived up to expectations, but I probably won't return as the food did not."}
{"text":"I was here recently for a group lunch and while the service was a little cold and I attentive, the food was pretty good.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad.  Here were only 3 small pieces of tuna which was less than I was expecting, however they were nicely crusted in a spicy rub and seared to perfection.  The bed of soba noodles with ginger soy dressing was also tasty, and the fresh asparagus added some nice greenery.  I thought it was a little pricey at $21, for what it was, but at least it was tasty!"}
{"text":"A quite place to go for lunch. After finding the door around the corner and making it upstairs for lunch. A big space in the dining area with lots of natural light made it very inviting. And just because everyone talks about the balcony, I took a quick look outside. Looks like it would be great to enjoy a drink and some appetizers out there. 

The waiters were attentive, but didn't come by as regularly as I like. Still had to ask for water a few times. 

The steak I tried was cooked to perfection though. The sauce reduction and the giant clump of butter melting on the 7 oz sirloin is worth going back for! I doubled the veggies and skipped the potatoes, but they looked good too. Loved the giant stalks of asparagus too."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!  Such a nice place to go to for a nice outing.   The open roof top is what really made me fell in love with this place.  Food is awesome.  Service is attentive and friendly. 

We ordered an appetizer to share (if you have been reading my reviews, you probably know what appie I ordered) - Calamari.  This is not disappointing at all.  Very tasty and good portion for an appetizer.  Main course - I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad....best salad I ever had!!  The Ahi Tuna was so fresh and the dressing for the cold soba was creamy and yet light.  Mmmm mmmm it was delicious.  

This is a great place for a date night!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our evening at Murrieta's. The live contemporary piano music was a very nice element of the experience. The decor is interesting from the classic lounge to courtyard style main dining room. The extensive wine list is reasonably priced. Murrieta's had a number of Italian wines featured on the night we were there. The menu has a lot of interesting choices. I think everyone will find something they enjoy from this menu. The restaurant was busy but the service was attentive."}
{"text":"Can't say much else than wow. My husband and I went with my parents for a nice Friday evening dinner last week, and we were all very impressed. What stood out most to us was the service, which we find to be mediocre at so many places, even night places these days. But at Murrietta's, the servers are trained, and trained well. Our waiter was attentive but did not hover, was efficient but did not rush us, and was friendly but did not overstay his welcome or intrude on our discussions.

We all had appetizers (the mushroom soup was seriously to die for). Three of us had steak, and they were all perfectly cooked (the Guinness chocolate sauce took some getting used to but it was amazing!) and the lamb was also very good. Only one of us had dessert, and I would say that was the least exciting part of the meal. It was fine, but nothing out of the ordinary.

This was truly a great experience."}
{"text":"18% automatic tip with group. Managed to get 2 beers in 3 hours. Wouldn't have left a tip."}
{"text":"One of the few places open early on a Sunday afternoon for dinner. We arrived before 4pm and were asked to come back as the wait staff were setting up the dining room. Glad we did! 
We sat under the glass dome on the restaurant side, what a beautiful space in an old renovated historic building. I tried the special Muriettas Caesar seasoned with horseradish as a cocktail and then ordered oysters on the half shell as an appetizer. My husband had the hummus and pita chips which were all made in house, delicious! We had read other reviews while waiting so ordered the seafood fettuccine and grilled mahi-mahi. Entrees were perfectly cooked and presented but we had no room for dessert. Next time!"}
{"text":"We had a friend in from out of town who never gets to spend time in Calgary and I thought he and hubby and I - would really love this place. The menu reads amazing - it is just the kind of food we like. Hearty, comforting, and there is loads of seafood found on the menu. 
Needless to say, it was kind of a special occasion as we had not seen our good friend in a couple of years.
Resos made, all set.
We went in a few minutes early and we were almost tempted to sit in the lounge. The main dining area is beautiful, white linens, lots of exposed brick and very sharp looking but a bit stuffy.
There was a large party and yep, we were crammed right in behind them against the wall even though at 545pm, there was a ton of space available on a Mon night.
Service was spotty at best (started out ok) and of course we were no match for that $$$ table that had about 16 people at it. The waitress pushed the higher end dishes IE steak when my dining partners wanted chicken. Turned out the chicken was delicious and they were happy with their choice. They also got calamari (good) and crab cakes (good). I got seafood chowder (really delicious) and the chorizo, shrimp and scallop fettuccine. I asked for al dente pasta. Al dente did not happen. If I am going to have pasta out, I always ask our server if it is a good choice as I can make my own fab pasta at home. I trusted her that it was good. I also asked for a little extra seafood instead of the chorizo - I do not think the extra seafood was added. I just wanted a plate of food that tasted good. I would not get it again. It was bland, needed garlic, maybe a hit of cream. What I got was a small glob of overcooked pasta in stewed canned tasting tomatoes with halfway decent scallops and shrimp. I said nothing of course but now that I think about it, we were not really checked on anyways.
Skipped dessert and coffee. 
The waitress came by, took payment, her generous tip for service provided, ripped the receipt off and huffed away without even a hint of thanks. Kind of left a bad taste in our mouths. Guess she had some expense account tables to chase.
Calgary servers (a good majority) really need to have mandatory courses on customer service.
If we come back, it will be awhile and it will not be in the dining area."}
{"text":"I am a bit late reviewing this, went during stampede and sat on the balcony - the balcony is great for watching people on Stephen Ave. 

I had the duck breast... it's all I remember and I will be back for it again. best duck dish I have eaten, period. 

I also like the bar and the live music. Restaurant side is great for those types of occasions. Murrieta's has a great mix of atmosphere's for all occasions and good food. Service was great. I had been there other times just for drinks and once for a large groups dinner - I've always had a good experience."}
{"text":"Venue is impressive in decor and ambience. We preferred the bar area to the restaurant, but both are attractive for different reasons. We ordered drinks and was persuaded by the waitress to try a draft beer over my initial choice of a bottled IPA. Wasn't to my liking, so the waitress was happy to exchange for my initial choice. All going fine until a different waitress returned quite a bit later with the same draft beer. Eventually, I got a drink 30 mins after arrival. I had fried prawns for entree and they were outstanding. Empty plate clearance was slow however. We both had the same order of Halibut with avocado. The serves arrived without the avocado and one plate had a tomato dressing that wasn't ordered. We received the correct dressing upon request. The dish was exceptionally good. The third waitress was very courteous and pleasant, while the others avoided us completely. My lasting thoughts were that it is such a shame to have a great restaurant in Calgary but we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"We frequently have work-related lunches at Murrieta's. The service is always awesome and the food is always spot on, but you're paying a relatively high price for those. There were some issues with the food being out of stock and the cook burning a pizza last time we went, but the management came over without us even asking and made it right. You'll always be treated well here."}
{"text":"I came in for dinner tonight with a coworker and was really impressed with this beautiful restaurant.  The patio was completely booked, but they seated us in the impressive, bright and beautiful dining room.  The service was great and the food was fantastic.  We started with the crab cake and lamb meatballs to start, enjoyed the halibut for my entree and finished with the blueberry basil sorbet - fantastic!  This restaurant is in a great location and if you are lucky enough to be seated on the patio, you'll have a great view of Stephen Avenue."}
{"text":"Had the duck shawarma and found it to be fairly underwhelming, greasy, and overpriced. The venue itself is beautiful, but overall, it fits the stereotype of being an expensive downtown spot for lunch. The salad was soggy, fries weren't crispy. Gets a resounding meh from me."}
{"text":"When I'm in Calgary I tend to go with steak b/c it is rather traditional here and they consider it important.  So I had their smallest steak  which was very well cooked and cooked medium rare like I ordered it, no small feat these days.  I was also able to order a wine from the Okanagan, not a great wine by any means but I like to eat local and support local when I can."}
{"text":"I stopped at this restaurant for dinner tonight (Sunday).  I almost did not come here.  I was looking for a \"classy\" restaurant and the \"Bar & Grill\" in the name led me to think that they served \"pub fare.\"  I do Hennepin fare at times, but I wasn't interested tonight.
Anyway, I finally checked the menu (and the reviews), and decided to give this place a try.
I entered and saw a very classy place, one that definitely did not look like a \"bar & Grill.\"
For dinner, I started with the soup of the day (potato bacon), which was good.  For the main course, I had the Pacific Halibut with Toasted Almond Romesco.  The halibut was cooked perfectly.  Personally, I would have preferred the romesco to be a little spicier, but that is me.  I finished with the three bite dessert, which was also very good.
When I looked at the attributes for the restaurant, I saw that it was classified as \"dressy,\" so I dressed accordingly.  However, I apparently did not get the memo about \"casual Sunday.\"  The decor and the staff are classy, to bad that does not apply to the clientele.
The waitstaff was very friendly and helpful.  The only problem I had was that they were a little slow in getting the check to me."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed this restaurant for lunch. Service was excellent. Kudos to Vanessa and Stephanie. We had to get in and out and Vanessa swooped in and got our orders up. 

Food was very good. Cobb salad was lovely with bacon, butter lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, cucumber, blue cheese, drizzled with pesto dressing. My friend loved her lamb meatball pasta. The steak sandwiches looked good but were overcooked. Stephanie offered to get us new steaks but we were fine with it. The steaks were still tender. She offered us complimentary dessert to make up for it, which was a nice touch. 

I look forward to coming here for lunch, happy hour and dinner. The prices are reasonable, particularly in light of the superior service and gorgeous venue."}
{"text":"Went to here on a Tuesday night with some folks from work.  We didn't have a reservation so sat in the lounge area instead of the beautiful atrium setting - at least we has then hockey game in ;).  

Had the crab cakes to start after finally choosing - so many tempting selections - it was great - reasonable portion and excellent  presentation - for the main course I was tempted to get a steak, but still watching what I eat so had the catch of the day instead - a ling Cod - again nicely presented and great taste.   Had a good draft beer selection as well.  The service was also good, friendly and timing was good as well.

Next time I will make a reservation so I could enjoy the atrium experience ."}
{"text":"Murrieta's continues to be fabulous!  I highly recommend the private dining room for small groups - their set menus are sure to please!"}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere in Murrieta's and the service is also top notch. 

But our meal was disappointing. 

The steak tartare was really disappointing. The Dijon mustard was overwhelming and really ruined the whole dish.

My Roasted chicken was a very large portion but again bland.

The tomato salad was totally under whelming and we did not like it at all.

The Ahi Tuna Tacos where actually Very Good and the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"We were here over the Thanksgiving Day weekend for my brother's wedding.  We had booked the entire restaurant for the day and we enjoyed ourselves very much.  It is a unique space with a three story high atrium above the dining room so it is nice and airy.  For contrast the adjoining lounge is dark and there is a patio over the 8th Ave mall.

The staff was very accommodating and we were there for 9 hours, from 4:00 pm to 1:00 am.  An enormous variety of appetizers were brought around during the cocktail hour, all were great with kudos to the coconut shrimp.  Entrees included 8 oz tenderloin, buttermilk marinated half-chickens and arctic char.  Everything was great and we wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Happy hour from 3-6 includes select types of wine, beer, and spirits for $5. On a recent visit, I enjoyed the sauv blanc on offer for white wine.

The happy hour food menu is a bit eclectic: consisting of sausage, meatballs, corn fritters, risotto balls and pulled pork sliders. 

After trying all five, my favourite was the corn fritters. In particular, I enjoyed the sweet sauce glazing the fritters.

It's a nice upscale lounge for an after-work visit. I noticed that Murietta's has a patio overlooking Stephen Ave. In the summer this would be a great place to hang out and people watch."}
{"text":"The restaurant is upstairs with a glass ceiling which is very pretty. They play the best 80s music ever. We started with the three dip and lamb meatballs. The hummus was bland but the olive tapenade was better. I didn't try the lamb meatballs but heard they were good. For dinner I had the penne turkey bolognese and it was just ok. It lacked seasoning and came across as basic. For dessert I had the apple tart with vanilla bean gelato. The crust of the tart and the vanilla bean gelato were perfect together. Not too sweet, a good balance. The apples were unfortunately undercooked and had this almost bitter taste that was inconsistent by the bite and a bit overwhelming which turned out to be cardamom in addition to cinnamon. Overall the meal was underwhelming but definitely edible (except for the apples). 
The only other point I will note is that a person at our table ordered a steak medium-well and the waiter challenged her. It made her feel like she couldn't have what she wanted so she changed her order (then didn't eat her meal). The assumption that the waiter knows more about how the guest would like her meat cooked is ridiculous and insulting. He mentioned the preferred style was medium rare and that's fine but the commentary should end there. Especially when the guest is from Texas. I assure you, we know how we like our meat. According to CNN Travel, our state houses two of the best cities in the country to get steak (Austin-4 and Fort Worth-11).  In addition, our country is second to Australia for the most red meat consumption. Know your diners before you try to school them!"}
{"text":"Regular food at steep prices.

I overall had an average meal at Murrieta's. Probably about a quality level where I'd be impressed at a mom and pop bar on the corner of some random street, but I really expected more from this place. When you walk into such a well decorated establishment with well-dressed wait staff, I expect the food to match the appearance. The steak I had was grisly and overall a bad cut of meat with a couple of bland sides. I know if I was the one picking up that bill, I would have been upset.

An overpriced meal that will get you average food at a nicer location."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in the past few years.  

For some reason I wasn't expecting to love this place and it totally won me over.  The interior is expansive with natural light (reminds me of Mescelaro's for those who remember that 1st St gem).  The outside patio overlooks Stephen Ave and offers beautiful views and people observing.

But, the food! Our (skilled and friendly) server offered recco's that delivered.  My steak sandwich melted in my mouth and the sauce with mushrooms is a taste I still dream about.  The fish taco's were deliciously spicy...crunchy and soft in all the right places.

One teensy curiosity?  My sparkling water out-priced the wine my companion ordered."}
{"text":"Searched for \"best steak\" near my hotel last night. Found Murrieta's. Went to eat for lunch since I've heard nothing but amazing things about AAA Alberta Steak. Found I could only order from the lunch menu. 8oz was the biggest they could go. I asked the waitress if I could get a bigger steak since I'm from out of the country. She told me \"oh well we have a side steak you can order by itself that's 6oz\". BINGO! It was hands down some of the best steak I've ever eaten. I made \"ummm\" noises with every bite. Im not lying. The place is super nice and clean. I highly recommend. I'll also have to dream about the steak till I can come back to Canada. Sooooooooo good!"}
{"text":"Another joint my colleague and I decided to eat at, though this one he found on Yelp. We ate in the dining room. He got the bison special, medium rare, that came with the most beautiful presentation. I got the bison pizza special, that came with cheddar cheese and a blackberry creme fraiche. It was good, but a little too greasy. Could have been better with a goat cheese instead of cheddar. Decent service. It was good, but I think there were better experiences out there."}
{"text":"The potato and leek soup which was creamy and fresh and a perfect starter! In fact the two people I was having dinner with also ordered it and loved it.

We shared the duck confit flat bread which was amazing! Really rich but a perfect shareable item (which is found on the entree list)

With both rich items, I opted for the Tuscan kale mushroom salad for my main and was bright and fresh and very tasty. 

The rest of the table had the sea food hot pot which was beautiful looking and he said he really enjoyed it. The other dinner had the salmon and she too liked her meal.

I'll be back next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"Place was only half full. Waited ten minutes for an appy only to find out the server screwed up the order and it would only take a couple more minutes. Ten minutes later we got Szechuan prawns ... a happy-hour special! Lukewarm at best. Another twenty minutes for the main which was the Scallop and Chorizo with Fettucini. Mediocre at best. Came here twice a few years ago and it was great, so I hope this was a one-off experience."}
{"text":"Oh em gee!  What can I say.  AMAZING atmosphere, fantastic food, and wonderful service.  Such a great place to go if you're from out of town.

The night I was there, I was on a tuna rampage. Have tuna tacos for my starter, and the Ahi tuna for my main...two words NO COMPLAINTS. So amazing.  The Ahi Tuna (Grilled Rare), melted in my mouth, and the Jasmine Rice, Daily Vegetables, Garam Marsala Vinaigrette was amazing.  I cant' wait to get back to Alberta (especially a town where this restaurant is) and dine here again.  It's a must for anyone who wants great atmosphere, and amazing food."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine at Murrietas. Food is prepared well. Service with a smile and our fav B.C. lakebreeze wine on the menu!"}
{"text":"Had really good dining experience here. It has a good atmosphere. 
Both of us had steak, we got the tenderloin and rib eye. Both of them were pretty amazing, perfectly good to measuring rare. 
It was on the second floor, the window seats was a plus."}
{"text":"For one of my recent birthdays (is it a bad sign when you lose count of birthdays?), my fiance treated us with dinner at Murrieta's.  We had heard great things about it.  We had also heard it was expensive, but really, it's not.  I mean, it's not cheap or anything, but it's definitely not the most expensive restaurant I've eaten it.  Their website has their menu, with all the prices (rare), so you can see for yourself.

The first thing I noticed about Murrieta's was the decor.  Ultra high ceilings and walls that are made to appear like the exterior of a building.  If you've seen pictures, it doesn't even come close to matching the experience of sitting in the restaurant.  I would suggest just going for coffee some time, just for the decor.

Of course, we weren't there for coffee.  The food at Murrieta's was phenomenal.  I don't just throw around that word.  When we walked out of there, I told my fiance \"best meal I've ever had\".  And it was true; I wasn't just sucking up to my fiance for picking the place.  I've had a couple of meals elsewhere that knocked it out of the top spot, but it was still an amazing meal.  Just thinking about it makes me want to return.

The service, another very important aspect of any restaurant, was incredible.  I've been to several restaurants that excel in one (food or service) and fail miserably on the other.  Murrieta's was brilliant on both fronts.  Our server was awesome and the whole experience made a long lasting impression.  Please try them out, and feel free to bring me along!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here at Murrieta's with my friends.  It has a been a long time that we'd been to Murrieta's.  I was on the hunt for a restaurant that had mussels.  And Murrieta's has it!  The Steamed BC Mussels appy is so good and tasty.  The waitress recommended that I get a small loaf of bread to sop up the delicious broth.  The only thing I didn't quite like was the thin frites in my mussels bowl.  Next time, I'll say to hold the frites.  My friends had the Lamb Meatball Spaghetti and my other friend had the Chicken Pappardelle.  They both had the 1/2 order and were very satisfied with their food choices.  

I like the wait service and it was quick and attentive.  Water glasses kept being filled.  The restaurant was busy, about 80% full."}
{"text":"My friend suggested us to came here to celebrate my birthday and I really liked it. Make sure you book your table way in advance as it gets very busy. We had supper and everybody was happy with their meals. I had the cheesecake as dessert which was so delicious! It came with a little flare as it was my birthday :-)
At around 10pm the live band started. The crowd is a little older, so the music is more like 80's but since I'm a fan of that music I was happy with that. The dance floor is a little small but we still had enough space to dance. My friend told us there is always a different band but they are usually good!
I was very happy with my friend's choice to celebrate at this place and we'll probably come back :)"}
{"text":"If you charge $8 for ice cream for dessert it better be Village Ice Cream and nothing else, well it's not, it's Mario's.  Hello I can buy Mario's at the grocery store!
Meal was nothing special, they do have GF rolls available but hard as rocks.  Meal was good, not horrible but nothing to write home about.  The back room (not the bar area) is a nice room, high ceilings which means it can get noisy.  
This place is not for the faint heart wallet wise.  Servers are nice but food knowledge is not on the top of mind when asking on preparation or ingredients.
Would I go back, not unless nothing else was open.  Not horrible, but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Fabulous decor and service, but I can't say I was terribly impressed with the food.  I came with a party of eight, and we all concurred that the meal was mediocre and overpriced.  I ordered the \"West Coast Bouillabaise\", which actually had more fingerling potatoes (!?) in it than seafood.  I suppose the potatoes were what made it \"West Coast\", but to me they just made it seem a little unrefined (and certainly made it cheaper to produce than the real deal).  I also got a dinner salad, which again was unspectacular (as was the bread served with it, which was stale).

On a more positive note, those who ordered dessert seemed to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Murrietas for quite sometime. Well that will be rectified STAT! Starting with a fresh tangy Caesar salad which led to one of the best margarita pizzas I have had in this city and finishing with the mushroom  pappardelle in a silky cream leek sauce. This of course washed washed down with a great bottle of red wine. What I love about Murrietas is their incredible food with very fair prices for what you're getting. The atmosphere is sexy, lounging and a whole lot of class."}
{"text":"Came here twice -- once for dinner and once for appetizers and drinks.  Dinner was great.  I had pasta with prawns and scallops.  The pasta and seafood were cooked perfectly and the sauce was very flavorful.  Appetizers were a mixed bag:

Flatbreads **
Trio of Dips **
Steak Tartare ****
Lamb Meatballs ****
Calamari ***
Tempura Prawns *****

Service was pretty good.  Nothing to rave about.

Not a bad spot for dinner and the menu had a nice selection.  I'll have to come back and try some other entrees."}
{"text":"Had a colleague in town last week and thought I'd give the expense account a workout and take him out for a nice dinner.  I've been to Murrieta's a few times and always have been impressed so thought I'd make an encore visit...very happy I did.

I arrived a little early so took a seat at the bar.  The mixologist made me an AMAZING Bloody Mary (actually he made me two since one wasn't quite enough).  Perfectly spiced, flavored and nicely garnished with a tangy pickled green been!

Once my guest arrived we made our way to the center dining room.  I should provide some background...Murrieta's is in a heritage building that many years ago was home to the Alberta Hotel.  Its a beautiful two story sandstone and in the center of the building where what I assume used to just be the roof of the main floor they've added a dinning room with a glass ceiling.  On a summer evening it has an almost patio feel to it.  

Our waitress (my apologies for not remembering her name...this is what happens when you don't yelp quickly!) was great!  Very friendly but never intrusive.  She was quite insightful with helping to pick the wine (the Barnett Pinot Noir which was very nice) and did a great job in keeping our glasses topped.  

As important as the service is I come to a restaurant to eat and Murrieta's like always impressed.  Given my previous liquid appetizer I went straight to the main course.  The special that night was a wild boar chop with scalloped potatoes.  OMG it was tasty.  The boar had bacon reduction sauce and was so tender.  Between the meat and potatoes I'm ashamed to say I wasn't able to finish the vegetables (a generic but none the less well prepared trio of carrots, broccoli and cauliflower). 

Given the hearty serving unfortunately no room for desert.  Probably for the best as it only would have meant extra time on the elliptical."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night with another couple and had a lovely dinner for four. We always like this restaurant because you can have a nice dinner in the dining room then move on to the bar where there is live music, I believe they start playing around 10pm.
Food was good, ordered the mozzarella salad and crab cakes to start (my gf mentioned the crab cakes were a little dry though), two different pastas, one fish and another salad. We had a few mixed drinks and a bottle of wine. Service was good. Will return in the future :)"}
{"text":"Decently priced, decent food. I wasn't wowed by anything. Atmosphere was awesome though! 

Crab cakes were really good! tuna tacos were decent. Trio of dips...just dont bother. 

Our mains were nothing too out of the ordinary for me to write a review on, plus it's 1:30pm and I'm drunk at the YVR airport."}
{"text":"Everything was great here!!... The wine was delicious!!... And the food too... I think there was nothing I didn't like... The service was very good too... Definitely nothing to complain... I would love to go back there soon..."}
{"text":"This is a really cool looking restaurant that is in an old bank.  It is very impressive to walk in to.  Overall I had an OK experience here.   The service was spotty, at one point we had to wait 20 minutes to get a bottle of wine.  Overall the food was really good, with the exception that my Salmon was over done.  

I would probably go back again to see if I had a better experience.."}
{"text":"New Years Eve ~ 5 stars all the way.  Great food, atmosphere, excellent service, great music.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"The manger is an idiot!

After I wrote this review and sent a letter to the manger he called me a couple weeks later and asked me to remove my post?????!!!!!!! I CLEARLY told him I had every right to express my views and to let other people with dietary restrictions know where they are safe to visit. All he did was make up bullshit excuses as to why I had such a bad experience and that it was a very rare thing.  I told him other people on yelp complained it wasn't just me.  It was 30 minutes of babble that came out of this guy's mouth.  Never ONCE did he actually apologize, he did ask me to come back I said I would have to take to my Fiance as he was more upset than I was.  My Fiance REFUSED to go back.  Especially after he heard the manager was trying to make it seem like it was all MY fault and was trying to guilt/bribe me into removing my post.

Might I add I NEVER mentioned in my letter that I made a Yelp review so they actually read these reviews which is cool I guess but still it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to ask me to remove my unflattering review.  Disgusting actually, just like my ENTIRE experience."}
{"text":"First the good stuff -- great dining room decor. Exposed brick, glass ceiling, lots of room.  Dinner was good -- both the pork tenderloin and a special wild boar dish. Spinach salad was excellent. However, this was not a $125 dining experience. For starters, hostess plugged us in a back booth near the kitchen -- even though the restaurant was almost empty. We moved. We ordered an appetizer, thinking it would arrive before the dinner -- then waited and waited and waited. The soup and salad arrived at the same time -- and finally the appetizer. We sent the appetizer back and finished the soup and salad. Then we waited 40 minutes for the entrees to arrive. Tough night. For that kind of money, we are paying for the experience as well as the food. And the overall experience means we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Wednesday - I've been here many times and the service is always good: prompt and polite. The food is generally very good as well. However this time I had the tuna tacos and to be honest they were awful. The sauce had no flavour the slaw was limp and then promised \"seared rare tuna\" was well done, and bland as tinned tuna. The accompanying lamb curry soup of the day was tasty but a tiny portion with maybe 5 bites. I will go back here for lunch but I will stick to the things I know are good (the scallop pasta) and stay away from any fish dishes."}
{"text":"On the first snowy day in Calgary, we headed downtown for a cozy lunch.  So many places downtown are closed for lunch on the weekends, which was quite disappointing.  Murrieta's however was not.

It wasn't busy, and we decided to sit in the lounge area by the cute windows so we could watch the falling snow.   The menu seemed a bit uninspiring but I settled on the chicken sandwich with fries.

The chicken was like a chicken salad with a really nice sauce.  The bread seemed like it came from a local grocery store, and made me feel like this could have easily been made at home for a fraction of the price paid.

The music was sort of strange, like a 90s lilith fair experience... I didn't mind it but my company was extremely annoyed.

Although our experience was nice, and the ambiance was lovely, the food seemed a bit on the boring side and wasn't very unique."}
