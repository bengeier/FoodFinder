{"text":"Excellent, clean, tasty, delicious food ! Friendly owners. Been eating there for almost 2 decades, and it never disappoints"}
{"text":"Après de nombreuses tentatives pour retrouver une cuisine asiatique riche en saveurs avec des ingrédients de qualité et frais nous avons retrouvé le chef Minh. Connu pour ses recettes riches en saveur. Son nouvel emplacement au cur de Laval nous offre un accueil intime et sans artifices, le personnel est amical et empressé de bien nous servir avec comme bonus des prix qui sont des plus raisonnables... Notre Asiatique préféré de tous"}
{"text":"Enjoyed two meals here over the last two weeks and I expect to be back again for more! Maison Minh has a variety of Asian based food with a focus of traditional Vietnamese dishes. For what it has to offer on the island of franchises, it's a nice gem to visit on occasio in Laval.  This placed recently changed names from Chez Tung to Maison Minh (new ownership) and the decor was upgraded. The interior of the resto is clean and Asian themed.  The service is friendly, chill even and both times the whole experience went by fast. The process of sitting down to order food. then the foot prep to being served your food takes about 15 minutes. This makes it a great as a lunch option. Lemon water is served.  First meal I enjoyed was a won ton soup followed by peanut butter chicken with crispy spinach. The second time it was grilled chicken and beef with side vermicelli and spring roll. Everything was on-point and packed with flavor. Portions are generous.  The menu is thick with recipes with \"table d'hote\" and \"lunch express\" options. Variety is plentiful except for Bahn Mi..... WHY CAN'T ANYONE MAKE BAHN MI IN LAVALLLLLL.  Priced tag is ok.  Will be back."}
