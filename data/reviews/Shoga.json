{"text":"This newly opened fast food alternative is right near the highway.  I got the teriyaki chicken with mushrooms ($6) and it was the perfect comfort food.  The prices are cheap; most entrees were under $10.  The sitting area is basic but clean; the stools feel a little high.  The drive thru window was not open; hopefully they get that up and running in the future."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and fresh. Highly recommend you go and check it out. Fast casual Japanese teriyaki."}
{"text":"Save your coins hunny! My first time there and they already owe me a free meal. I stopped there for lunch. Yes, the lobby was nice and shiny...but did they have to marinate the chicken in super salt?! I ordered chicken, broccoli (I got half a piece of broccoli) and brown rice with a side of yum yum sauce. Got back to work and opened it up...three POUNDS of salty rice, no yum yum sauce and this salty chicken has certainly shrunken my kidneys. When I called I was told that the person that seasoned the chicken OBVIOUSLY didn't \"read the recipe in the cookbook\".. Yep, not my fault. My name is in a book for next time...will there be a next time?
Stay tuned for the review! Gotta go and water my kidneys now!"}
{"text":"Just tried there food today it was amazing and  it's different from other Japanese food it's healthy your actually eating chicken that tastes like chicken and the service is great soon as you walk in its all smiles I will defnalty be back thank you"}
{"text":"Man listen it's just tasty I don't know what else to say. It's like African American Asian fusion here and I'm just happy"}
{"text":"Where do I start..... I was excited to try a new place and then I tried it. I placed my order and then about 4 other customers came in. My order was simple, teriyaki chicken with steamed rice and zucchini. Everyone that came in after me got their orders and I was still waiting. When I finally received my order, I wanted to give it back. I don't know what the meat was but if it was chicken then it must have been foreign. The egg rolls were bad as well with Some weird seasoning in the inside. The place was clean so I gave it one star but I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for lunch had the chicken with veggies & fried rice food was excellent service was friendly place was very clean and nice you can see the cook make your food from behind the glass i will patronize here again for sure"}
{"text":"A great example of fast casual Japanese food. The service was great. The food was fresh, and cooked behind glass at the front counter making the preparation process completly visible. The dining room was bright and clean. 
I wasn't going to write a review, but the standard of service for most of the asian take out spots in the city is so low, that I felt it was important to share when a place made the effort to raise the bar."}
{"text":"Since it is on the way to and from work I have tried Shoga four times.  Located on Woodland Road near to E.55th, Shoga is an attractive fast food place, with white decor and red accents; they keep the place clean and have been working to make this place successful.  My experiences have been a bit of a mixed bag, but overall Shoga is worth a try.

First off I would not call this Japanese food, but rather Japanese style food, where you pick your protein, vegetables, topping, starch and sauce.  They then cook this on a flattop in front of you in a glass enclosure.  The difference between the small and large order is the number of vegetables you get to pick; with the small being one vegetable, the large you get three.  The process is not as smooth as it could be, but it seems to be getting better.

My first order I tried was a large shrimp with broccoli, mushrooms and peppers with a mix of the hot garlic and the sweet teriyaki sauce.  The shrimp and vegetables were well cooked, but I was disappointed with the amount of vegetables.  For the price I thought it was miserly.  I also found the sauces to be a bit bland and under seasoned and the fried rice to be too dry.

The next few  time I got a small order of shrimp with peppers over the noodles with coconut curry sauce and it was very good.  The portion of shrimp was the same as the large and in addition to the peppers they added an assortment of vegetables including onions, carrots and cabbage which made for a much better value.  The noodles work well as they are cooked on the flattop with the other items, so they are fresher and more flavorful.  The coconut curry is excellent, with good body and flavor, plus quite a bit of heat that will make your taste buds tingle.  This has become my go to order and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who likes spicy food.

I have also tried the shrimp eggrolls and they are a fresh and crispy with several good sized shrimp inside.  I believe these are made in house and the quality shows.

Service overall is good, but at times the system seems to need work.  You should watch your order carefully as I had to make sure that the order was complete; on two occasions I had to make sure that they put in the eggrolls I had ordered.  The staff is friendly and tries hard, but this is a local business so there are glitches.

Overall Shoga offers good quality food at reasonable prices; some of the food is much better then other choices, so your experience can vary greatly.  Shoga does provide a quality food option in an area of the city where there are not many such options.  If you are in the area and are hungry give it a try."}
{"text":"I'm all for black owned businesses but there is a complete unprofessional atmosphere.  Food is not up to par. Rice is pre cooked and in a rice cooker and watch out if you are allergic to Shellfish. The cook will use the same spatula to work on the chicken, beef and shrimp. Which common sense says use three different spatulas. I thought everything was cooked to order like a real Japanese restaurant but to go. Unfortunately I won't b returning."}
{"text":"I went there a few times when it firat opened and it was AMAZING . I stopped there 2 weeks ago..the cashier at the counter was rude ro say the least ..it took me 22 minutes to get my food and she spent more time talking to her ride that was waiting on her. A man came in to pick up his food and she was so rude to him that he left.
I decided to give it another try last week..i got there at 1103pm and the young man seemed upset that i got there at 1103 when they close at 12. I ordered my main dish with fried rice and he laughed and said \"we dont do fried rice this late since you the last customer and we closing\" i said im sorry i thought you closed at 12 he said \"naw and we domt do fried rice late\" i told him to forget my order and i would try someother time. He laughed and said \" you sure? I mean we got brown rice\" ... i had a lengthy conversation with the owner when they forst opened on how impressed i was with her spot..but it has gone SEVERLY down hill in quality of employees and customer service. I sent dozens of people there over months but wouldnt send anyone there with THAT type of.customer service .
Very sad"}
{"text":"There might be a planet out there that would think of this as Japanese food, but I have a hard time believing anywhere on Earth would consider it such. 

I ordered some Shoga through Uber Eats on a Saturday night, just before 2am, as it was one of the only options available at that hour. After imbibing a bit earlier, I found myself desperately hungry and to my drunken palette, this meal was terribly disappointing. The portion was large, but there were WAY too many noodles, not enough vegetables and the entire thing was a greasy mess. Also, the accompanying yum yum sauce was unlike any I've ever had before and not in a good way. It was super sweet and very bizarre, in general. 

Two stars- one for the portion and one because they deliver late, but that's about it."}
