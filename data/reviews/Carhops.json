{"text":"Great customer service! I ordered the Rueben and quickly decided that it was one of the best that I've ever had. My wife and I also loved their cheese fries. Will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"The Diablo (cheese burger) we each had at Carhops today was fantastic!  We really enjoy this place.  You get a ton of really good food, for a reasonable price.  The fries are always fresh/hot. The people that work there are friendly and fun!  We have also had their subs and are looking forward to trying the Friday Fish sandwich special sometime soon!  Definitely a great place to stop if you're in or near Monroeville."}
{"text":"Best hoagies anywhere.  The ingredients are wonderful and the rolls they use are perfect.  Cheese fries with bacon are the best outside of Kennywood.  The menu is enormous but if you don't see what you want, just ask.  They'll make it any way you like.  

I go for the Celica GT, but add cajun chicken to it (so it's steak, hot sausage AND cajun chicken).  They call it \"The Hearse\".  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot in monroeville. Sandwiches are excellent as are the salads and fries. Generous portions. The man running it seemed very kind and passionate about the business (thinking maybe he is the owner?) and inquired several times about how we liked our food. Only downfall is that it's cash only but that's not enough to make this a place not worth trying! Give it a try- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great local place for a subs, burgers, fries, wings, etc. Their subs come in 1foot and 2 foot sizes. Comparing these to say... subway or quiznos. I would say they are slightly skinnier and are mostly meat and onions instead of heapfuls of lettuce. The selection is huge, and everytime I am there I choose something I haven't had or don't remember having.

The place itself is a shrine to old cars and you can spend the whole time looking around as you chew your food.

Awesome for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I love how laid back it is, how friendly the guys are.  And the food, once you have it you'll understand."}
{"text":"Best steak hoagies in Monroeville. And the guys that work there are so nice and friendly every time I go there! The hoagies are really big and the fries with cheese are a must have!!!"}
{"text":"I got a cheese steak here and it was pretty good!! Good fries too. Also, the owners were very nice and friendly :) cute decore and music inside.. also a TV with sports or whatever may be on at the time I guess! I'm sure we'll be back in the future!! - I got a cheese steak & fries :)"}
{"text":"One of the best cheese steaks in Pittsburgh,   Hands down!   You must head out to the one in monroeville and order yourself a z28 hoagie and some turbo fries.  You will not be disappointed.   The bread is always fresh and comes in daily from the bread works and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Carhops is truly a hidden gem in Monroeville.  The food is great and the staff is very attentive.  It has a very nostalgic feel when you walk in like you have been transported to the 50's.  A time of muscle cars and corner diners.  The names of each sandwich is the name of a car and the walls are covered by car memorabilia while doowap music pumps in the background.  Will definitely come back and recommend it to anyone who wants a good sandwich at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I love Carhops! I have been going there for years! They also have a location on West Liberty Avenue. 

They have hoagies, burgers, fries, wings ,salads sandwiches etc. Every hoagie is named after a car. You have two choices in sandwich sizes, coupe - 1ft and sedan - 2ft. They offer cheesesteaks, chicken, reubens and Italian subs.

I love their burgers too. All of which are named after Lamborghini's such as the Diablo, Countach, Espada, Muira and Jalpa. My favorite burger is the Jalpa. It consist of a cheeseburger with melted cheddar cheese and bacon and is outstanding!

They are open:

Monday - Saturday
10:30 am - 8:00pm

Sunday
12:00pm - 5:00pm"}
{"text":"I had a really bad day.  Like really awful, all I want to do is sit on the couch in my flannel monkey pajamas and watch terrible wedding shows.  Needless to say, I had zero urge to get up and make anything to eat, let alone go to the grocery store or a restaurant.  So I looked up delivery places in Monroeville, and up popped Carhop's.

Now I've lived in Monroeville for 4 years, but I didn't even know of Carhop's existence... I do remember passing it, but I thought it was a car shop I guess - apparently I don't pay attention.  So I checked out the website and decided to order out.  I chose the Volvo Vegetarian, some cheese fries, and fried mushrooms - the perfect blend of grease and cheese to suppress my anger at the world.  

About 20 minutes later it arrived... a GIANT sub.  Holy Toledo, apparently the \"sedan\" subs are 2 feet long (what?!?).  I had no idea... guess I'll have some leftovers.  The food is overall decent.  Good fries, good cheese on the fries (not that nacho cheese garbage), great bread for the sub (thin subs, but everything tastes fresh).  I feel slightly less annoyed with the world.  The only thing to keep in mind is that you can't order takeout with a credit card - cash or check only.  Meh.  I can handle that.  I will go back for more greasy goodness in the future.

And to clarify, I did indeed answer the door in my flannel monkey pajamas.  The delivery guy was really nice, though I'm sure he was judging (who wouldn't?)."}
{"text":"Just ordered the Z28 coupe size and it's very delicious. Haven't had a good cheese steak in a while, I'll definitely be back to try more items! But seriously, no credit cards? Just pay the fee or incorporate it into the price of the sub"}
{"text":"First time eating here yesterday! Cheesesteak was amazing also the bacon cheese fries! The employees were so nice and helpful! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a visit to Pittsburgh,had the Impala ss,the bread was fresh and all the ingredients where also.it's more then worth a return visit"}
{"text":"Wow!  These subs are amazing. I had the Z28 which was phenomenal. I ordered the half sub which was a footlong. I ordered fries to go with it and it came in a huge basket. All together it was $11.00 and it could honestly feed two people. I had no idea there was going to be so much food. Apparently the whole hoagie is two feet long. They don't take credit or debit so be aware of that but who cares, the food was out of this world."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, unique ambiance. I thought it might not be easy with kids and tried alone. But next time kids will come too, there is enough space for them and interesting things on the walls. Note: cash only!"}
{"text":"The best cheese steak you will find in this area, no doubt. The fresh baguette type bread is such a game changer compared to hoagie rolls you find in most restaurants/pizza joints because it really lets the quality of the meat shine which definitely takes place here. The fries are always cooked to perfection as well and the cheese sauce is awesome. The gentleman who cooks, and I believe owns the place, is always so friendly and great for idle conversation while he prepares your meal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Cheesesteak hoagies.  Carhops has the best so far that I have had in Monroeville. I have followed them from their old location in Monroeville, to the newest one. It's a huge jem hidden in Monroeville in a strip mall on Business 22, next to Elmer's Aquarium. I have not been to the Strip District location.  As an old car lover, the car names on the menu items are awesome!! They offer two sizes: 1ft Coupe and 2ft Sedan how clever is that !! I love the Deville ( cheesesteak ) the Riviera (steak, cheese with grilled mushrooms) and the Z-28 (steak, grilled onions, white american cheese I ask with no garlic). They offer Italian hoagies as well, and other sandwiches, but I go for the Cheesesteak. I am not a Penn Station fan, just something not right about them for me. I enjoy watching the owner make the hoagies, he has always been friendly and pleasing to talk to. The steaks are always made fresh and I have never had a bad experience. This is not a restaurant per say. Yes they have a few tables to sit at, but it's more for takeout. You seat yourself and get your own drinks. If you're looking for waiter service this is not for you, but if you really want a great cheesesteak, I highly recommend. CASH ONLY !  They are closed on Sundays. They do deliver in the Monroeville area."}
{"text":"Find this place randomly gotta say great food, and a lot of food for the price. Will for sure go back to this place."}
{"text":"Great food!  Best subs in Monroeville!  Love the Cajun chicken with the pepper relish!  Staff is great very friendly and quick.  Nuts and bolts (fried mushrooms) an turbo cheese fries (fries, cheese, and hot sauce) are great too!  Nice chill atmosphere too.  Salads are gigantic and good too.  And have to mention the ruben that is also gigantic and enough for two.  If you get a ruben to go get fixins on the side or sandwich will be a mess by the time you get home. 

Two notes, cash only and subs are huge! Regular (coupe) is a foot and Sedan is a 2 foot sub.    

Highly recommended over the subways, Quiznos, Penn stations, and Rudy's of Monroeville.  MUCH better food.  

I wish they served beer here, however they do not.  This would be a perfect place for a six pack shop like Uncle Sam's subs in Aspinwall, who are also very good.  However I would guess byob would be fine."}
{"text":"This place is set in a strip mall off the main road a bit. Hard to find even with gps.  Thought it would be interesting based off the info I got on Yelp.  Maybe Yelp is different in other areas.  I guess you gotta work with what you got.  

Got fries, wings and Philly steak sandwich. Nothing outstanding.  Certainly not worth a detour.  But service was friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Wonderful local feel. Cash or check only.

Very reasonable prices. You do get a lot of food though so be prepared for leftovers. We sat at the bar and chatted with the owner/cook who was very kind. I had the chicken parmesan sandwich which is served in an unexpected and delicious way. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best Sandwiches in Pennsylvania. Yeh. I've tried most if not all the 'Best' places on yelp and google and NONE compare to this place. From the perfect slices of meat to the enormous 2 foot bread; this is by far the standard that your favorite has to contend with.  As a sandwich connoisseur you can definitely trust to try this place. From the decor to the food you will not be disappointed. 

Don't forget to ask for the special sauce- out of this world!!!

Only thing that faults this place is cash only. There is however an atm."}
{"text":"The food is good. Huge sandwiches. I was the only person in the place on a weekday. Ordered a sandwich and fries. I asked for iced tea. The order taker walked over and looked at the soda vending machine and said we have ice tea here.  Went to pour the tea and it was water. Sandwich came without the fries. I asked if the fries were coming and he said \"You didn't order fries\". Good food if you can get what you order."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The staff is friendly and very welcoming. I can't say enough about the Cheesesteak! It was delicious and they give you enough for 2 people. The only critique I would have is, they don't take credit cards. I use an expense account for work so I had to write a check. Otherwise, I will visit each month when I am in the area. The people appreciate your business and it shows. Give it a try, you won't go wrong. They poke energy thing to order. Oh and it would be nice to have different size beverage cups."}
{"text":"I really don't get it. All these high ratings, I mean. I came here once. It's filthy. The sandwich was horrible. The \"turbo fries\" were just cold soggy fries. They charged $2.50 for a can of Coke. I really don't get it."}
{"text":"Stopped by on way out of Pittsburgh. Can only comment on the Reuben, but with pretty effusive comments. Yes, the bread is cut to a very healthy thickness. And then it is lathered with garlic butter and grilled to perfection. Before it is *laden* with meat. (Some joker wrote about a lack of meat. Absurd.) The sandwich is at least two meals. But you'll probably eat it all at once and then chill for a day or so, taking only water. Just awesome. I go to a lot of places on yelp that are plenty popular and have no need of my input. But this isn't a hipster joint in Lawrenceville. It is a totally unassuming, totally great sub shop run by nice people. You should probably go."}
{"text":"Had the Reuben sandwich, which was delicious!  It was so big
that I had it for both lunch and dinner.  The staff was very friendly
and the restaurant had a nice laid back vibe.  I was digging all the
decorations and posters!  I will definitely be going back to try some
of their other sandwiches in the near future."}
{"text":"I would be heart broke if this place ever closed.....best friggn steak n egg sub i have had in 35yrs.....


       Sincerely,
              ATL GEORGIA"}
{"text":"Place is clean, 24\"sub  for $18.00 but they put very little meat on it I would call is sparce. The Ruben makes no sense at all to me, two pieces of 1-1/2\" thick Texas toast style rye bread with again very little meat. If you love bread this is your place otherwise you get more meat at subway. What a shame for a local owned/operated business I understand why they are not busy at 12:35 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is always freshly cooked I recommend the steak and cheese hoagie it always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"This was the best \"cheesesteak\" I've had in a long time!! I ordered the Roadmaster and it did not disappoint!! The staff was super friendly and the shop appears to be well maintained! They are cash and check only but have an ATM on site. Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Very friendly! Food was great. It was a great experience the menu is very creative. I had the z 28 it was delicious. If you like cars this is a cool to check out."}
{"text":"I used to go to the one on West Liberty avenue and since I've moved to California have spent at least once a week complaining about how it is impossible to get a good hoagie out here...and I keep whining that I can't get carhops out there.  So I came home to Pittsburgh this last weekend and found...the location on West Liberty was closed in the process of moving to the strip district...nooo! I needed carhops now! I couldn't wait any longer and wouldn't be home for months to get another fix so...I drove to Monroeville.  Yes, in traffic, in the rain to Monroeville from Dormont to get my hands on a Carhops hot Italian sub dripping with yummy slightly vinegary goodness.  

I also thought it was cool they had red birch beer as a fountain drink and it was pretty delicious. 

If I didn't live 2800 miles away this place would be a problem for me."}
