{"text":"Gyros here are fantastic, I prefer lamb and was so much better than expected flavorful.  They meat off spit and crisped on grill , pita's also crisped on the grill.  Take out only from what I saw."}

{"text":"A newer gyro shop in the Bedford area located in the same strip mall as Las Americas.  When I walked in and I was greeted by the friendly owner.  Everything looked clean and organized.  It is a small location so I would categorize it as a take out place.  They do have two small standing only high tops so if you want to you could eat there.  There is a cooler with various bottled beverages to choose from.  The counter is close to the kitchen.  I love how you can see what's going on in the kitchen when they cook your food.  The cone of gyro meat prominently spins on the heater next to the flat top.  I ordered the lamb and beef gyro with fries and was it delicious.  It was hot, lots of meat, onions, tomato and tzaziki sauce.  Simple, filling and flavorful.    Gyro and Wraps is a great option if you are into gyros and such.  I noticed that they have a pressure fryer so next time I'll have to try the fried chicken.  They recommend calling in if ordering chicken so they have time to prepare it.  Cooked fresh to order is not a bad thing.  I give the them a high recommend."}
