{"text":"Bought a couple of buns from here as snacks to go with our HK style tea. Everything was fresh. The winter melon pastry is especially tasty. Best I've tried."}
{"text":"I found the sign a bit misleading since I wanted egg tarts and the promotion referred to buns.  I didn't know tarts were buns.

Anyways, it was my own fault for not asking first.  I purchased an egg tart and it had a flaky crust.  $1.  Not bad.  Kind of small.

Had I purchased 6, it would've been $4.20. I guess I didn't really need six..."}
{"text":"Nice pit stop for some reasonably priced Chinese buns. Right across Latea Era, pick up a sweet or savoury bun to go with your drink.

Grab a tray and tongs by the door, if you want to take advantage of their $5.50/6 special, then choose items from the white trays. More expensive items are on the orange trays with individual prices marked.

Friendly informative staff, tasty treats, favs are the pork bun, sausage bun and coconut bun. If you come after 5pm prices drop to $4/6."}
{"text":"Best pineapple BBQ buns. Just get those. But in a seriousness, the buns are big and filled with a healthy portion of whatever you want inside (BBQ, red bean, custard). 

$4.20/6 and then after 5pm its $3/6. Apparently it's for any buns but for some reason I was charged more (didn't think to ask why). Either way, this is my go to bun place because its just THAT good."}

Max Bakery might be a good place to load up on buns if you have an army to feed.

$5.5/6 then $4.00/6 after 5 pm.

Egg Tart ($1.05) was meh. The crust was not flaky nor buttery. The custard itself was not smooth but gummy. A perfect example of how egg tart should not be like. 

Chicken Pie ($1.50) was meh. But at least the crust have a nice buttery crunch.

Maybe the buns would have tasted better?? I hope you are into buns.

The lady serving me though is nice and cheerful. +0.5"}
