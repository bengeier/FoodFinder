{"text":"*Easily one of the better coffee options in downtown PATH that I've had. It's easy to order (pick cup size, choose type of coffee/latte/etc, tell the barista your name!)  *A simple cup of coffee here is both super creamy and smooth! Also comes with latte art.   *Favourite non-coffee drink thus far (contrary to most reviews already) is not the mango chai latte but rather their matcha latte. Very distinct almond-like silk taste thats subtly sweet and hearty.   *Service is friendly and prompt. They can never spell my name right but that's alright. Be sure to avoid 9ams and 3pms as these appear to be their busiest."}
{"text":"Great cafe right on your way out of King Subway. They have tasty sandwiches, soups and breakfast options. Their breakfast boxes are similar to the protein boxes at Starbucks but they are better and fresher. Their coffees and teas come with frothy milk which is a nice touch. They have non-caffeinated teas as well."}
{"text":"I love Mos Mos coffee!  I was introduced to Mos Mos by coworkers at the location in the PATH in commerce court. The first time you go there it's a bit overwhelming with the way you have to choose your cup size and sticker to tell them how you want your coffee made, but they always have staff there to help you if you need it. The coffee is really wonderful and they have really tasty cookies and bars. The staff are always very nice and helpful and you don't have to wait long for your coffee. For some reason people can't seem to figure out how to line up at this new location. It's a bit mystifying."}
{"text":"Mos mos, the best coffee that wakes you up in the morning. Better than Starbucks, second cup, mc Donald's.   Simply love this coffee!!!!   They accept debit, credit, cash for the coffee !! It's frothy and with swirl design (not that I care, but the enthusiasm is there)  Staff is friendly and listen to how you spell your name before they write it on your cup (unlike Starbucks, who ask you for your name, but never get it right). (That's more important than the swirl lol)  Simply love their coffee, purchased their card to ease out the payments."}
{"text":"Excellent coffees. I go here almost daily to get either a standard Mos Mos coffee or a Latte.  The standard coffee is a delicious house blend and I prefer it to Starbucks/Second Cup.  The latte is a decadent delight.  It's rich, creamy and perfectly made.  The staff is very friends, the music is bumping and the atmosphere is great.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"All you need to know is Mos mos is the best coffee shop in the financial district. Don't be fooled by the long lines or sticker system, the staff are friendly and helpful to get people in and out.   My favourite treat is the iced matcha green tea latte. Even a simple coffee is amazing as they steam the milk and top it off with coffee dust.   My small complaint is that the food options are on the pricey side for nothing special. Thankfully the drinks make up for all of this."}
{"text":"Lacks professionalism is responding to complaints and the ability for their employees to respect their clients. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"For starters I should say I don't drink coffee. I don't have an appreciation for the bitter taste bud, and so guzzling this caffeine injected beverage is not high on my priority of things to do in the morning.   I will however, occasionally order the fancy specialty coffees - those doused in sugar flavour shots and powdered toppings. I am not ashamed that I am a fake coffee drinker. In fact, the White Lao has become my favourite iced coffee! It's a creamy iced coffee which probably comes from a packaged coffee mix (I asked once if I could make it less sweet and she said it's pre-made). It's aromatic, sweet, and a nice pick-me-up.  During the colder days, I order the Mocha Latte. It's chocolately and light on the espresso. You can customize your milk, and they steam it JUST RIGHT. They finish it off with cocoa powder and latte art.  My coworkers live by the drip coffee here, so that probably says something about the caffeined beverage which I don't consume. But supposedly it's the best coffee in the financial district. Perhaps one day I'll give it a try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their coffee and their lattes! I always order a vanilla espresso latte with cocoa powder as my topping, and I haven't had a bad one yet!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Don't ever get the iced matcha. Super grainy. Felt like I was drinking sand. Had to get them remake it twice and there was still a ton of gritty pieces at the bottom. Avoid."}
{"text":"Just tried a cappuccino and chai tea latte. Both delicious! Very smooth and excellent quality. You know the coffee is good when you don't have to add sugar! Hidden little gem! Can't wait to go again and try more menu options!"}
{"text":"I was recommended by my friend to try the chocolate latte and it was amazing! Just the right amount of sweetness (no additional sugar required)."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get coffee. They do a café au lait/café misto kind of coffee so your coffee comes with steamed milk and a bit of foam on top. The coffee is smooth and doesn't have a bitter/sour aftertaste that I sometimes find with coffee. My go to is a small #3, the skinny single single (1 milk, 1 sugar). You can also ask for skim milk. I also recommend the red latte if you're looking for something without caffeine, and the chocolate latte if you're looking for something very chocolatey/dessert-like. The prices here are cheaper than starbucks.   Their baked goods are also good. I've had their gluten free raspberry loaf, which I really enjoyed considering it's gluten free, their low fat mixed berry loaf, and their breakfast cookie. All quite good. Their chocolate banana bread was okay but I thought it wasn't moist enough and didn't have enough banana flavour.  The line may be intimidating in the morning but it moves quickly. Best coffee and best service in Toronto."}
{"text":"I come here on and off depending on how long of a coffee break I want to take away from work.    Pros: cute little coffee shop, reasonable prices, friendly staff  Cons: creative but inefficient ordering system.  It takes me so long to find the proper sticker and the lady each time ends up asking me again what I wanted.  Seems a bit redundant.    Also, the last couple of times the coffee tasted more bitter..."}
{"text":"good coffee... extra care with steam milk for free :)"}
{"text":"I made this my afternoon coffee stop today, having seen the excellent reviews by other Yelpers.  To be honest, I don't see the big deal with Mos Mos. Sure, the \"label your own cup\" idea is cool, but it's a solution for a problem that really isn't a problem, and takes longer to figure out what label to put on your cup than it would to verbally give your order to one of the staff.  I ordered a medium latte which was very reasonably priced at $4, and it was made with care by the lovely staff who were very friendly. Although I didn't try any of the baked goods, they all looked very tasty indeed.  In terms of the coffee itself, I found that although the milk in my latte was steamed to perfection, I found the espresso itself to resemble those awful instant coffee pods you use at work - it just tasted a little on the artificial side.  I'll definitely drop by to try their brewed coffee as this is usually my preference, so maybe that will be better."}
{"text":"Ever since I've discovered MOS MOS I've been hooked. I've easily recommended this place to several people and all those people go there on a regular basis. First of all its a great location within the path right outside of the king subway station. So it's easy to grab on the way into work. Also because it's located in the path, it's great all year round. Secondly the service is fast and friendly. They have their own order service that involves stickers and numbers. Each number indicates how you take your coffee. When you take your cup there is a large legend there and you simply follow it. I've never waited for more than 3 minutes for my coffee. This place is great if you're a coffee lover who just wants some real tasting coffee and not that watered down stuff you get elsewhere.  Their lunch and breakfast food is also great. They have kind of a Thai indian inspired lunch menu and fresh breakfast carbs lole toast and bagels as well as a variety of pastries. I suggest to get the red Thai chilli soup for lunch. It's delicious.   My favourite part of this coffee joint is that they give you steamed milk on top of every coffee. And also dust some coffee dust and  make a beautiful design. It really enhances the flavour.   The only negative thing is that there is no seats but it's located steps away from the ccw food court.   A must try. Great tasting coffee!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of coffee in Toronto, and Mos Mos is always my go to place on weekdays. Delicious, affordable, and in the path. Something about the milk they use is mind boggling. It's SO decadent and heavenly!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Passed by here unintentionally and saw the long line and thought to get my morning coffee fix here. They have an interesting ordering system which for a first timer may be a bit confusing. Once you learn it, you won't forget. The drip coffee is better than the average coffee shop and they add a unique flare to it. Each coffee is essentially served 'misto' since they pour steamed milk/cream into it. This is a nice change from the regular cold milk/cream at most places. For their cherry on top, they sprinkle on some cocoa powder and swirl it to make a nice pattern on top."}
{"text":"This is upgraded coffee for people who think Tim Hortons and Starbucks coffee is good. For the rest of the people who actually care for a well-extracted espresso shot with micro-foam and proper milk-to-coffee ratio... not so much.  I ordered my typical cortado here, but it tasted nothing like how an actual cortado should taste.  The foam was thin, the coffee tasted overextracted, and the ratio was off.  If you want actual coffee in the area, please go to Sam James, Pilot, M Squared... just to name a few!"}
{"text":"I had the single double double (but honestly wasn't sure if it was a latte) with almond milk and it was delicious! The fig pistachio cookie was filling and tasty! This will be my new place to go to! It's fairly priced, I got a large cup and the cookie and total came to 5.25.     Customer service was friendly and pleasantly. I walked in on a weekday a little bit pass 8am and it was starting to get busy. I didn't know how the sticker system worked so the lady came out and helped me out. Mos Mos definitely beats Starbucks hands down in quality and value.  Ps - and I always love some personalization on my drink (latte art and the cup). They pass that with flying colours!  I look forward to dropping by again!"}
{"text":"Love this little place we stumbled upon while in the neighborhood. My partner had The Dutch Slider that he really liked. I had a savory Dutch crepe with cheese and mushrooms that was perfect for me. I can't wait to go back and try a sweet crepe. Our waiter, Paul, was delightful and a highlight of our day. The decor is adorable and I really appreciate how clean it was."}
{"text":"Tried the Skinny Double. It was so good! The coffee taste is strong, and the caffeine is crazy strong!  This is a must for people who love a strong coffee.The Small Skinny Double is $1.90 which is the same as a Short Brewed Coffee in Starbucks. However, there is a big quality gap especially in terms of strongness."}
{"text":"One of my favourite go to spots for a morning coffee whenever in the downtown core!  I have never been disappointed with my orders here at Mos Mos, they make it perfect everytime. Try to go a bit before or after rush times (9am/3pm) and you'll be in and out of there in less than 10 mins!"}
{"text":"BEST coffee in Toronto, hands down.  They charge the same same as a regular coffee from Starbucks but it's the taste of an amazing Latte!  Just make sure you get it with some milk.   Our ask for the froth on top.   I usually do a special order myself,  1 sugar,  1 cream,  1 milk.   Try it!   You will not regret!   I still come back even though my office is so far away now."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars  I tried the chocolate latte on two occasions. The Latte is just way too sweet and takes forever to make. They use real melted chocolate.   The barista works with precision accuracy, adding ingredients very slowly, thoroughly mixing, then more ingredients.... and more mixing. It's painful how long the process actually takes.  Unfortunately, the end result is not worth it. I can never finish it - I \"OD\" on chocolate half way through.   Kudos for trying hard, but not my \"cup of chocolate\".  BK"}
{"text":"The coffee quality isn't as good as some of the smaller cafes (eg Sam James), but it is still good, and much better than the chains (Starbucks, Timmies, etc).   Price is very reasonable... $3.5 for a large Americano (including tax), I also like how they steam the milk (I don't think that there's an extra charge for this). And I like that I can very easily specify how much milk to add.   It's a little tough to locate though, especially if you suck at navigating the PATH as I do."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for coffee after a recommendation from a friend.  A nice change from your typical timmies/starbucks/second cup.  No seating, but tons of sweets and treats.  The neat thing about mos mos is you pick up your own cup and put a sticker on it.  The stickers denote how you take your coffee.  They'll take your cup and prepare it for you then add a cute personal design which is a nice touch. Their coffee isn't particularly strong, but it's frothy - similar to richtree.  Is it worth finding in the Toronto Path maze?  If you like strong coffee, not really.  If you want to try something different - yes!"}
{"text":"I stop by here every morning before I go to work. Big line up most of the time. I like how you take a sticker and choose your own cup size and just hand it over to them. Similarly priced to grande Starbucks coffee but it tastes better and they actually use steamed milk.. I just buy the coupon for 21 dollars and get a free cup every 10 times. Excellent replacement and upgrade over other typical coffees"}
{"text":"Interesting little boutique coffee place located in the Path at Commerce Court West. With the tagline \"savor the moment\", this store definitely attracts many downtown business workers to spend a little moment of their time to savor their coffee.   They have a very interesting and efficient way to take their order. Rather than waiting until the counter to specify the coffee that you want, you can simply use pre-printed stickers and stick the choice of your coffee to the cup (ranging from small, medium to large). Aside from the usual coffee type (American, espresso, cappuccino), their flagship product seems to be their chai latte. They have a good range of election for chai latte and I tried the mango chai latte. It definitely tastes refreshing compared to the traditional London fog.   I will recommend coffee drinkers to give it a try."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Just opened one on York and Queens Quay business building.   Beside the Miku Japanese.   We had the Carmel cake, and crunchy almond toffee cookie ! Both super moist and delicious   Chai Latte with Mango and the Maple Flat White. Both made lovely and hot ! Perfect sweetness / milk added to both drinks as well.   They offer these fancy looking powders to put on top of the coffees and drinks as well.   I had fun choosing my drink here too with the stickers !"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I worked nearby and it's one of the things I miss most about moving locations. The have a wide variety of custom drinks, such as lattes and mochas (there are some special types too), but their drip coffee is unique too. Instead of having you put the milk in yourself afterwards, they steam the milk first, put it at the base of the cup and pour drip coffee on top. If you want, they'll put cocoa powder on top and make a beautiful pattern. You pay the price of a normal cup of drip coffee elsewhere and get something that tastes like a latte because of the steam milk.   They also have the prepaid cards that is \"buy 10 drinks get 1 free\". You have to pick one specific type of drink, but the return on this is much higher than the starbucks system now (especially if you buy the cheaper drinks)."}
{"text":"Hidden coffee gem in the underground at King station.  I read the previous reviews and thought I'd try a new coffee shop near work.  I went after lunch and there was still quite a line up.. When you get to the front of the line, they ask you to choose a cup size, apply a sticker that matches accordingly to what you would like to drink, then they ask for your name.  I decided to try their Mango Chai Latte, as this seemed to be a popular drink that many other Yelpers have tried.  I don't usually drink Chai but thought I'd give it a go. Definitely recommend trying it.  It has a subtle taste of mango thats not too overpowering and it's really smooth and delicious.  The second time I came by I was hooked on the Mango Chai Latte, and the third time I tried their Cappucino.  I have to say that the Cappucino tasted just as good as the Mango Chai Latte.  So I'd probably say this is my new favourite coffee shop at the moment.  If you go in the morning, expect a long line up, but for the most part they're pretty quick at serving everyone because they always have enough friendly staff working there.  The only thing I have to complain about is how many times they have spelt my name wrong and failed miserably!.. Hopefully the next time around they'll get it right."}
{"text":"Best coffee downtown! I wish they opened more locations. The steamed milk that comes standard really changes the coffee and makes it smooth and delicious. Be prepared to get hooked and not feel the same way about your everyday coffee."}
{"text":"Unique coffee shop located just in Commerce Court near the King Station subway exit. I pass by here every day and is always tempted to buy their coffee because not only does it smell good but tastes so good compared to it's competitors. I'm not usually a coffee drinker but whenever I need a caffeine fix, I come here because it never fails to disapppont. I've tried their chai lattes and original coffee and love them both! I swear it must be the froth but it's just the artistry and craftness of how they make their beverages. Not to mention the amazing service that you receive every time even during peak periods. Highly recommended if you want to try some authentic tasting coffee!"}
{"text":"What kind of crack does Mos Mos put in their coffee?! It's so addicting! After hearing my friends rave about this place, I then wished I live in the dt area or worked in the area to see what all the fuss was about.  Recently, my friend offered to buy me a chai latte and I jumped on the offer! I swear it was love at first sip, this chai latte tasted better than all the other chai lattes I had in my life! And it's not too sweet either, just the right amount of sweetness to it. And then yesterday, the same friend got me a coffee but this time she told me it was half regular coffee and half dark roast because the place was closing and that was all they had left. I didn't mind the mix of coffee and wow, to me it tasted like Timmies double double but even better! But my friend told me their regular coffee tasted wayyy better. So until I get that coffee, I will give it 4 stars for now!"}
{"text":"One of my fav coffee shops! My favs are:   - matcha latte - hazelnut latte - English toffee latte   Line always move fast and there are alternatives to normal milk such as coconut milk, soy and almond!"}
{"text":"Mos mos has the best coffee in the whole PATH system! They made my latte with care and swirled in some powdered chocolate on top to make it pretty. I also like the rolls of stickers that you use to customize your coffee. It's very arts and crafts.  I had the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie-super yummy!   They are right next to the King subway access point which is very convenient."}
{"text":"I was determined to find this place one day when I had some time to spare. I'll admit I got very lost and kept turning in circles, but I eventually found it right outside King station's entrance into the Path. I got the mango chai latte, and I'm not kidding when I say it is possibly the best latte I've ever had in my life so far! It was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, and it didn't taste like artificial fruit flavouring at all. To top it off, it was very reasonably priced. If you're in the area and looking for the perfect latte, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Visited Mos Mos in commerce court/the financial district this morning at around 9am.  Luckily, I read some of the reviews beforehand, so I knew about their cool sticker system and wasn't a total noob.  I still ended up kind of noobing myself, as I couldn't find the Mango Chai Latte sticker - I only saw the coffee stickers underneath the stacks of cups, so I asked the lady writing the names on the cups where the sticker was for the Mango Chai Latte, and it turns out the Latte ones were right below where the lady was.  I made my way to the cash register, paid $5.00 for the large, then joined the large crowd of around 15 people waiting for their drinks.  It was kind of difficult to hear the petite Filipino baristas over the noise from the large crowd and surroundings, so I had to be super focused to make sure I heard my name when my order was ready.  Despite there being a large crowd, it only took 5 minutes before my drink was ready, so I was pretty pleased.  The Mango Chai Latte was good, but not amazing imo.  It has a decent artificial mango taste (like bubble tea), with a Chai kick, and was milky, which was expected as a Latte.  Definitely enjoyable, but not a regular morning ritual.  With that being said, I definitely need to try their critically acclaimed coffee.  They already captured 1/2 of my heart with their super efficient system, and they now have the potential to win the other half with their coffee."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place! I've been here twice with different coworkers and there's a consensus here: we have all said 'wow' after the first sips. No exaggeration.  This location of Mos Mos is convenient for all corporate peeps - located in the Commerce Court exit of King Station, Mos Mos has a lineup that seems to vary throughout the day. One thing for sure - their coffee is the SHIZ. I tried their flat white, and it has enough caffeine to get me through the afternoon, and then some! Their small is the perfect size for a flat white.  Prices are cheaper than the Starbucks in the core."}
{"text":"Mos Mos is located in the PATH, near the Commerce Court West food court. It's a popular location for downtown professionals to grab a quick coffee or snack during work days. However, it's definitely not your average Tim's or McD's coffee. Mos Mos coffee is freshly made and tastes very smooth. They also allow the customer to customize their own drink by choosing milk and sugar options depending on their own preferences. I also tried their Matcha Green Tea latte, it tastes very fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I come here every morning ever since my friend showed me this gem. Coffee is great and super consistent! I found my favourite coffee for anyone that doesn't like too much milk or sugar try #3! The best part is you can prepay for a coffee card to save some cash! They froth your milk and also do a nice design with cocoa powder. What more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"First time coming here got scared by the line but since I had lots of time before work I decided to wait. Surprisingly the line went by really fast. They have an efficient system with different sizes of cups and stickers of all possible drinks they have and you pick your cup and sticker,give them your cup, tell them your name (again I had the issue of having my name spelt wrong), pay and wait for your drink. The whole process was pretty smooth,  probably because everyone in line were usuals and don't have selection problems. I got the mango chai latte after hearing about all the good reviews on it. Personally,  I'm not a fan of it, the powdery mango flavour was overpowering the chai."}
{"text":"This is our go to coffee place when we are willing to walk a little further then the nearest Starbucks (which is around every corner). The coffee is excellent and so is the price and presentation. Their house blend is sure to please almost all palate as I prefer my coffee bold while my friends like mild, yet we all love Mos Mos. Do not be intimidated by the sticker system, just read the options (I'm a 4 - two milk 1 sugar ;-P). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I truly believe this is probably the best coffee you can find in the downtown PATH area.  This amazing coffee place is located right next to the King Station inside Commerce Court.  Most of their coffees come with steamed milk (to make an art piece on the coffee), but you can still choose cream if you prefer.  For only $2.10 for a large coffee, this is by far the best coffee compare to places like Starbucks or McDonald's which cost around the same price.  All their staff are super nice and always have a smile on their face!  On top of their great coffee (I usually do 2 milk and half sugar), I also love their chocolate croissants!  They are fresh every morning and run out fast!  So if you see one, make sure you grab one to try!  (I will upload a picture later)  One only negative I want to mention is they don't accept credit cards for any purchases under $5.  If you work in the financial district in downtown Toronto and want a good quality coffee and some snacks for the morning, I highly recommend coming here!!"}
{"text":"This place has incredible coffee, incredible service and such a great vibe.  The coffee is always fresh and every time I go, I know exactly what to expect. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"If you are able to go here for coffee you are lucky, one of those places you miss when you can't go anymore/everyday, only complaint is not open on weekends but that's expected downtown. Be ready for a lineup, it's worth it. They also have kept prices reasonable since the changes in min wage exc. Everyone we brought here stopped going to starbucks."}
{"text":"Mos Mos is a popular barista that's racking up in popularity with its regulars and newbies in search of a new place to kick-start their caffeine intake to compliment it with some baked goodies.  FYI a second location will be opening at the Exchange Tower in the same food court as Burger King.   Mos Mos is among one of the most popular baristas in the PATH. Serving delicious cafe late, cappuccino, coffee, flat white, tea, etc.  Their service like most places down in the PATH is efficiently good.  Lastly and most importantly their drinks are made with quality.  In my time coming here I've fallen in love with their flat white both (Almond and milk), Organic green tea, cafe late and their coffee.   If only this place had an app like Starbucks i'd come here more often....once a day perhaps.  Their service is fast, friendly and efficient. Prices are reasonable, just a tad cheaper than starbucks Quality is superb!"}
{"text":"I come here regularly when going on coffee breaks with co-workers. The line is overwhelming, and so is the process in selecting a cup, choosing a sticker, etc.   Recently, I have gone for the apple cider, which is different and I don't think it is offered in a lot of the other coffee shops. It comes with a cinnamon stick and goji berries.  In terms of pricing, the coffees and espresso-based drinks are very expensive. This should come as no surprise in the financial district though!"}
{"text":"No matter where I'm situated in Downtown Toronto, mos mos is my go-to coffee shop. I usually order the regular coffee - skinny with two milks and one sugar. The best part is the foamy milk that tops the coffee. Personally I like my coffee with a bit of milk, but lattes are a little too milky for me, so this feels perfectly smooth with a bit of foam on top. As you can see from the photos, they also top your coffee with cocoa, whisking it into a pretty flower. Much better than just pouring your own regular milk into a coffee cup!   I've also tried their latte and cappuccino which are also top quality. Always strong coffee taste and piping hot. The banana breads are well made, with a wide range of flavours (dark chocolate, double chocolate and lemon poppyseed), as they are always soft and flavourful.   Definitely check out mos mos if you are in the PATH or the Downtown Core, it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is located right outside of King Station (the Melinda Street exit). It is my favourite place to grab a cup of coffee before heading to work.   My order in the morning is a large #2 skinny with two milks and a 'fog cutter' sticker. The fog cutter is their darker roast. At $2.70 for a large coffee, you cannot go wrong. I think the steamed milk they add on top is the perfect touch to a cup of coffee.  You can prepay for 10 coffees by purchasing their coffee card and get the 11th coffee free.   If you are hungry for breakfast, grab one of their toasts (around $1.85). I love their peanut butter and jam - always the perfect amount of sweet and saltiness. It's warm and they wrap everything nicely for you to eat on the way to work.  The lines do get quite long around 8:30 am to 9:00 am and at coffee break hours, but it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great people. Great coffee. Great eats! This place is unique because they steam the milk for your coffee and have a standardized process. Very neat. Price is comparable to Tims also.   It can get a bit busy at times so the pick up location is small. If they can pump the orders out as fast as they can take them it would be a 5/5  4.24/5 *"}
{"text":"I love their Matcha Green Tea latte and regular chai latte. Delicious and not too sweet. They are also super friendly."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for good indie coffee shops near work and so thought I'd try out Mos Mos. Ordered a soy cappuccino and was not impressed. Tasted kinda like Marche or Sbux coffee, which I am not a fan of.  If you are particular about your coffee, stick to Sam James, Plenty, Balzac's or even IQ for your caps/lattes.   Service was great though, the women there are really friendly!"}
{"text":"Support great coffee while support local businesses.  The banana nut muffin is awesome and usually sold out before 9am..."}
{"text":"Props to Mos Mos who have managed to differentiate themselves in a chain dominated coffee market...and the customers love it. By this I am of course referring to their unique, cute little sticker ordering system. Essentially you pick your own cup and sticker for what you want e.g. latte and tick the boxes for your milk selection etc. It makes the ordering system very fast and thus the line to pay goes very quickly.   Most people you see milling are waiting for their orders, but even then they don't have to wait long. The ladies of Mos Mos are friendly, unflappable and run a high functioning production line, whipping out coffees like nobody's business.  So what's the coffee actually like? So keep in mind I'm a Sydney-bred coffee snob. It's alright, very drinkable but nothing to write home about. I find that like Starbucks their milk to coffee ratio is way off in the larger sizes so I usually stick to a small. It also somewhat irks me that they do latte art after the fact using cinnamon and a popsicle stick. Not sure what that does to the crema.  When I come here I usually get a dirty chai latte. It's not too sweet and has that hit of caffeine to complicate things. I also tried the pumpkin spice latte but it was a little to artificial syrupy for my taste. These folks offer a full selection here and they have stickers to match: red eye, canadian, matcha, pumpkin spice, vanilla, peppermint...you name it. And then have all of the milks as well (dairy and non dairy).  In terms of price it's probably a little cheaper than Starbucks. I pay close to $5 for my small almond milk, dirty chai hipster drink. Then again it is Commerce Court so its all relative, right? Mainly I'm grateful to this place for broadening my colleagues horizons and getting them to step out of their daily Starbucks/Tim Horton's routine. They are literally and truly obsessed. When do we get our corporate account?"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? No matter how many coffee spots I try in the Financial District, I always come back to Mos Mos. It's quality coffee at Tim Horton's prices(ishh) - how can you go wrong? For a medium coffee, I pay $2.25 (taxes included).   It's easy to order, service is always with a smile, and the coffee is perfectly smooth, pleasant, and downright heartwarming. As others have said, regular coffee is ordered by choosing your \"number\" (the pictures by the cups easily indicate the number of sugars and milks associated with each order number) and sticking it on your cup size of choice (I'm a #5!). If you're unsure about the process, one of the baristas will almost always approach you with a helpful smile.  While it's a bit of a wait in the mornings, the crowds are there for good reason. You can't go wrong with a morning of reliable, quality Mos Mos."}
{"text":"The coffee (green tea latte that I tried) is very different and you get a really good green tea flavour out of it. They have a little bit of a bittersweet type of after taste but it definitely is worth the try if you're a coffee lover or just a foodie in general.   Generally the lineups are decent - always about 3-4 people lining up occasionally. Service is good there and the staff are friendly/polite. My friend also tried their iced coffee (maybe espresso) which I heard was pretty good as well.   Located down in one of the corners in Commerce Court - might be easy to miss if you end up doing another circle loop if you head down one of the stairs."}
{"text":"Ahh whats better then a nice cup of latte. Mos Mos located in the financial district near commerce court is a gem. Their lattes are one of a kind and I prefer this much over * bucks.  They are very efficient with their orders, definitely my go to place to grab a latte."}
{"text":"The cardamom chai latte is the closest I can find downtown to Pakistani-style chai (without going home and making it myself), and for that I'm eternally grateful. The mango and matcha chai lattes are good, the flat white is amazing during my coffee phases, but for me cardamom is the king.  Also, please consider taking your first few sips with the lid off. It's a shame when people put the lid on immediately and that perfect froth goes to waste!"}
{"text":"I visited the Mos Mos in the Commerce Center on King Street, and I have to say that they are without a doubt the most efficient coffee shop I've been to in a long time!  I got in line at what must've been a peak time, since there were easily 25 people ahead of me.  My first thought was \"oh no\", and I expected a 20 minute wait for my drink.  However, the line moved very quickly and within about ten minutes, I had my drink, a maple latte.  I find that maple-flavoured drinks can be way too sweet, but this one was perfect.  2 Things I liked - The speed of service!  They must've had about 7 people behind the counter and one person taking your order using the efficient sticker system, and the line moved so quickly.  The variety of drinks and treats.  I saw the maple flavour and jumped on it, since it tends to be seasonal, but saw quite a few other drinks I'd easily try, as well as a bunch of unique goodies I've not seen at Starbucks or Second Cup.  I'm still hitting myself for not getting a white-chocolate matcha cookie!  1 Thing I didn't - n/a"}
{"text":"Got the flat white here.  I couldn't taste any coffee/espresso flavor, just steamed milk.  My colleagues got the brewed coffee and gave it a thumbs down too.  I guess it has good reviews for the convenient location?  There are plenty of better options in the area."}
{"text":"Mos Mos is a cute little coffee shop outside King Station. It's pretty unique with their sticker ordering system. My friends introduced me to this place. It's a nice change to have a Cafe au Lait vs. Latte (way cheaper)! I usually have the regular coffee - skinny double single aka two milks one sugar. Their brewed coffee is good for the cafe au lait. I love lattes so when I'm not feeling for a latte this is a good alternative.   Their system is good because you can order and then go pay so while you're paying they are making your order. It gets really busy in the morning but the line goes pretty quick. You can also purchase a prepaid card if you go often.  I would recommend you to check it out if you end up being in the Yonge and King area in the path. The prices are slightly cheaper than your typical coffee chain like Starbucks."}
{"text":"My favourite coffee downtown, and maybe even in Toronto! I've tried some of the other popular coffee shops in the financial district and on Queen West, but find myself going back to Mos Mos again and again.  I've had their regular coffee (skinny double), flat white (so smooth!), and cappuccino (my favourite) - they never fail to disappoint. The coffee/espresso is very aromatic, and the steamed milk (for no extra cost) is the perfect touch. There is quite a bit of foam even with skim milk.  The baristas are also generally very nice and service is fast. They also do cute latte art no matter what drink you order. Overall, Mos Mos to me is an unpretentious place that serves good coffee. Now if they only expanded to a location where one can sit down for a while on a chill weekend afternoon."}
{"text":"Super addicted to Mos Mos, love how they have stickers for different drinks. My favourite has been their Matcha Latte and Flat White.  PPL working here are super nice.   They have many dairy substitutes - soy, almond and coconut. But they don't have unsweetened ones. If I want my regular Almond Latte, Id still have to go to SB or Dineens."}
{"text":"Best Coffee ever. Go there everyday. I prefer their mocha/cap to marche, second cup and starbucks. Oh did i mention they are cheaper than the rest? Absolutely the best deal."}
{"text":"Got the mango chai latte like everyone else that wrote a review for Mos mos and it was good. I would say despite my reservations of a mango flavored latte, it was delicious and something I would get again. Its a nice pick me up if you don't want a huge caffeine boost."}
{"text":"Great coffee and very friendly staff members. Plus you get a sticker and your name written on the cup!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the mango chai latte - and at $3.50 for a medium... bye bye Starbucks for my latte fixes. It has just the right amount of mango flavour so that it's not super fruity and makes it smell soo good. My go-to drink when I come here.  I tried one of their ice coffees as well, called the Iced Sherbat. I'm not a coffee connoiseur, and I have no idea what a Sherbat is (pls educate me if you do). The menu describes it as 'lightly sweetened silken splendour on ice' and it's at $3.75 for a small. It's a very creamy type of iced coffee...hm I would say it reminds me of a slightly watered down melted frap - very delicious though! I'd get this again on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Mos Mos! Mos Mos! Mos Mos! I feel sorry for my colleagues who have to deal with me chanting this 3 times a day for my daily doses of caffeine.   After a 5+ long year relationship with Starbucks, I had to break up and move on to something better - Mos Mos. This place is honestly as good as it gets! Their coffees are absolutely delicious and their chai lattes are even better! My personal favorite drink there is the mango chai latte with almond milk. It is priced between the cost of a Starbucks coffee and of a Tim Hortons coffee, but the quality is far superior than both. I wish I could give this place more stars, but a 5 star \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" definitely hits the spot!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say it's the best coffee shop downtown but they're not bad.  The store is too small though and there are not too many things on the menu.  Location is convenient since it's right next to the King subway station. If it's your first time visiting, you would be confused with all the stickers because there are so options to choose from. I still get confused myself and they are always willing to assist if you are having trouble.  Last time I ordered the Latte and the taste was kinda watered down or I'm just used to strong expresso taste? I'm still addicted to the Vanilla bean latte from Second Cup which is just next door and they have more options!   If you happen to be in the area, you should give it a try although I didn't get the WOW experience."}
{"text":"Just when I thought that I found the perfect coffee at Starbucks, I discovered MOS MOS.  If you work in the financial district, then you must come try a coffee here.  I love the way they customized your order with your choice of the number of steam milk shots and sugar that taste so good!  It taste just like a Café Latté or to be more exact it is a Café au Lait (not with espresso shots).  They also have a good selection of specialty coffee/latté but I haven't had a chance to try it yet.  If you like your coffee stronger, you can select the Fog Cutter instead of their Café Mos Mos.  If you know that you'll be a regular, you can buy the prepaid 10 coffee and the 11th one is free!  I got one of these prepaid cards just last week and have been going every morning since then."}
{"text":"This little coffee shop has always a long lineup no matter in the morning or late afternoon. I kinda understand why: quick and efficient service with sticker system, amazing latte art with one stir, delicious chai latte and matcha latte, even pretty ladies serving at the counter.   I love going back whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"Just outside one of the doors to the King station in Commerce Court PATH is a little gem of a coffee place.  Unlike the conventional Starbucks or Second Cup nearby, this has a squad of lightening quick and organized baristas.  I counted no less than 6 people behind the small counter.  Their prices are far better,  they give a generous pour, and its a good tasting drink... what's not to love?  I definitely found a nice PATH spot.  I arrived shortly after lunch to see 5 people behind the counter ready to take my order.  They have everything so well organized.  They have nice line up dividers with a bright menu and clear descriptions.  Before you even reach the barista, you have a person taking your order with drink stickers showing your name and milk preference.  She was so efficient and able to answer any questions happily.  The ordering maybe took less than 15 seconds and then I saw a whirl of activity shortly.  They constantly have 3 people making drinks and one handling the cash.  I dont think anyone stood waiting for their drinks more than a minute.  It was impressive.  I was tempted to go with the seasonal pumpkin spice but I decided to go with my Dirty Chai Latte with almond milk to test it out.  I ordered a medium but I swear it was close to a large size in most other places.  Considering I ordered it with a special milk... it only came up to $5 and change.  Impressive!  The cup they give you is incredibly sturdy and doesn't need an extra sleeve.  The drink itself ... pipping hot!  Much hotter than Starbucks!  As for the flavour... I appreciate how it isnt a candy drink but much more well rounded with spices with a nice kick of the espresso shot.  It wasn't as strongly tea flavoured or uniquely spiced as Sawada or Asado in Chicago but it's far better than most other coffee places in the PATH.  I'll definitely come back and try other drinks ... super fast and happy service with a great drink.  Perfect my Toronto PATH walks."}
{"text":"This place is a godsend. I have no idea what they put into their drinks to make them taste SO good (almost too good...they taste sinful!)   The Mumbai latte is definitely my go-to drink, and even their snacks are delicious. I love their breakfast muesli. It's perfectly soaked, with fresh fruit and just the right amount of sweetness.   This place is a Financial District staple and worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"This coffee is really good, I just like saying mos mos! Good treats too!! New matcha latte is my new favourite! I make this a regular coffee break stop weekly!"}
{"text":"I love mos mos, love the chai latte and green tea latte. Decided to be adventurous and try the mango chai latte and it tasted odd - sort of like melted mango ice cream?"}
{"text":"Mos Mos has the best coffee I've ever had!! Thank god I first came with someone who's probably the biggest fan of this place because ordering is a little complicated. To break it down: you select your desired cup size by taking a cup, you find the sticker of the type of beverage you want (coffee, cappuccino, latte, tea) and then hand it over to one of the employees.   Be careful when you decide to drop by because when it gets busy, it gets BUSY. Wait a good 20min after the 3pm rush if you wanna save some time.   I've had the cappuccino with 1 sugar, and it was so smooth! The baristas sprinkle cocoa or cinnamon powder on top of the foam and create a little latte art with it. The Mango Chai Latte is something special - granted the mango flavour tastes artificial but that's expected. I asked for 1/2 sweet and it was already plenty (would recommend doing this). If it bothers you, I found that most of the sweetness bunches up at the bottom despite already being stirred by the baristas."}
{"text":"Two words: MANGO CHAI. Honestly it's the only thing I've tried here, but after I got it the first time, I was hooked. It's just so unique, I honestly don't think you can find it anywhere else. You would think that maybe the combo of mango and chai would be kind of weird, but somehow it just works, and the end result is a super smooth drink with just a hint of fruity sweetness. Yum! They also make some pretty nice designs on your drink and not even just using milk/foam like the usual latte art, but using coffee dust or something. And as a bonus, a medium chai latte is only $3.50, which is a reasonable price! I really should try other things here (maybe like real coffee? haha) but until I get sick of the mango chai I'll be drinking one thing here and one thing only."}
{"text":"Love everything from here. Mumbai latte was my favourite so far, but espresso is amazing too! Everything was so great and so addict to"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Mos Mos' cookies - gluten free power cookie to be exact. The cookie consists of raisins, chocolate, flaxseeds...to be honest, that's all I can detect. I am not entirely sure what certain about the type of flour used. I just know for certain it is yummy, it is $2.50 and it is potentially a \"guilt free-er\" option than it's whole wheat cousin."}
{"text":"I had a chai latte from here and it was just ok. The flavour seemed a little off, I don't know what exactly it was. The sizes are pretty good for the price. Service is good. Stickers are confusing though? I'll probably be back to try a drip coffee."}
{"text":"The Mos Mos is located within the PATH at Commerce Court, right outside the King St TTC station. I've been looking for a regular place to get coffee since my office location changed. I came here after reading all of the great Yelp reviews. The ordering process was extremely simple and straight-forward. There are stickers for each drink and the staff places a sticker on the cup size you requested. The cup sizes are slightly larger than I expected. I ordered a mocha latte and thought it was just okay. I was surprised by the smooth and mild flavor. However, I thought it tasted only slightly better than what I would get at Second Cup. Unfortunately, Mos Mos will not be my regular go-to spot for coffee, but I will definitely come back to try some of their other drinks."}
{"text":"Consistently great coffee. Quick and friendly service. Price is good considering the area! Would highly recommend stopping by on your lunch break. Don't be intimidated by the line, it goes by very quickly!"}
