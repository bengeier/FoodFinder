{"text":"This is the best cafe I have ever been to! They give out boba for free, which no cafe I have been to has ever done. The staff are friendly and nice environment. I am definitely going to be coming back in he future!"}
{"text":"Want to try it here!! I love boba! The place looks clean and cool... looks promising! Until I was ready to order! It was like a 25 mins wait for my boba drink, and there's ONLY 2 of us who ordered! Not even complicated orders, like lemonade for the other lady and I ordered Milk tea boba. Omg! I was waiting and waiting and waiting! It took them To make both of our drinks for like 25 mins and I am not exaggerating! My husband went to CVS to buy something, he came back and my drink still not done. I was passed already. So I finally said something and asked if I can go and have my drink they said few more minutes. I was ready to leave then someone brought my drink and it was nasty because they did not even wipe the spills on the side. It was flavorless and the boba was not even good. So yeah I threw 80 percent of my drink. It's such a waste of my 5$ will never go back here! I will give this place 1 more month and it will be closed!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cute but even though it's right by my house I can't come here often because it doesn't have any outlets! I need to be able to charge my laptop at my study spot. I got the matcha frappe with boba and it was pretty yummy and a hot coffee for only $1   They both tasted pretty ok. Kind of a funny after taste to both but I'm gonna try the strawberry green tea next time  The prices are really cheap though so it's unfortunate that I can't become a regular.   Note to the owners, the half and half can't be left out on the counter all day. He flavored creamers don't need refrigeration but cream does! I like that you guys have a high quality ingredients but if it's curdled from being room temperature then it's kind of a waste."}
{"text":"Thai tea was so gross. Tastes like water and sugar. Boba balls were good. And the cafe itself is a nice atmosphere. Maybe the smoothies would be better not sure if I'll try it again."}
{"text":"We bought this around 12:50pm. Its now almost 2:30. I cannot drink and I truly am disappointed. It is too sweet and a complete waste of money. The girl was very sweet like my drink. I really wanted to like it. The boba was hard: like a rock.  Please spend a bit of more time learning the flavors and mixture of each. Add on: They offered to make another one for free. Has potential wish them the best."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to go get boba in Vegas. The staff is wonderful and the drinks are out of this world. The strawberry slush is my favorite."}
{"text":"Amazing boba at an amazing price Is across the street love the workers very friendly and nice place."}
{"text":"good drinks nice service! maybe call beforehand to check if they're open if you're trying to go in the morning"}
{"text":"Had the Thai Tea and it's easily the best one ive had in Vegas by far. Staff is really friendly and the drinks are great!"}
{"text":"Love this place but u guys need more workers last time I went I had to wait a long time for my boba either then that I think it's great.. maybe less pricy!!"}
{"text":"Definitely such a great place, the environment is relaxing. It's pretty much drinks only. My sister got some Thai tea slushes and I got the butterfly lemonade. I'd never thought the butterfly lemonade would taste amazing, and it's also mesmerizing to look at! It's very refreshing, natural, & I highly recommend to try it with the mango popping pearls & it creates like a trio color to it  definitely will be coming back for more & I'll be sure to try the cookies and cream next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Cheap with great discounts for posting and reviewing on social media. Most of the drinks seem to be made with powder, but for the price, it's still worth it for a boba fix."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends, decent drinks and friendly staff!  I ordered the butterfly lemonade, tastes great and looks like a cocktail you order from some kind of fancy bar lol"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood & we're excited to see a new boba cafe open. The staff is super nice & accommodating. Will definitely be a regular. Thank you for the amazing chai latte"}
{"text":"Had to update my post because of my second visit. My first visit they were closed but the manager personally reached out to me to say sorry. When I tried to visit again today the staff is super friendly and the drinks were great! The best part of the trip is how kind and understanding the manager was She didn't even want to accept my tip. They are a brand new small business which I believe is family owned and have had trouble finding new staff members. The manager and other woman who made our drink was super nice and they offer a wide variety of drinks (I'll post a picture of menu so you can see the different flavors) the place is clean and well set up and has plenty of seating. Plus they offer discounts throughout the month and discounts to the employees that work in their plaza. Definitely a bobba place to try out."}
{"text":"Milk tea isn't like most - which is both good and bad! Gotta get used to the difference (which isn't bad!) but the upside is that it's significantly less caloric! Young woman working tonight was especially nice and helpful to us! My daughter got a milk/Thai tea blend and loved it!"}
{"text":"Went here a while back maybe their boba has changed. But I would not recommend ordered taro milk tea with boba. The boba had a funny flavor think the worker had some hand lotion on. Very bad after taste. Skip this place if you can."}
{"text":"Dreamland cafe's boba drink is by far the worst I have taste...needs more practice. If the place is still open after a year then probably I will try again. I am very disappointed. Where is boba city"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time tonight and it's such a cute little place. I love the fact that they have a decent sized menu and they actually give you free boba if you purchase an iced beverage. They also offer other toppings like popping pearls and various jellies for an additional cost. The prices are pretty decent. I tried their lychee black tea with boba and lychee jelly. I forgot to ask for it half sweet so it was really sweet but still tasty none the less. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was the fact that the boba in the drink was slightly harder than I'm used to. It wasn't too hard but a little. Other than that it was good. I really loved the sleeve the put on the drink as well! Super cute! The decor was super cute as well! Would definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I luv boba tea with pop up pearl, this is the only place i can find sell the pop up pearl. The tea taste good especially when it's hot yumm freshhh"}
