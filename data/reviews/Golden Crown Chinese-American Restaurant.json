{"text":"I love Shrimp Mei Fun.  A lot of people don't know what it is or have ever ordered it.  There is a special taste to it and it needs to be made with all the ingredients that are typically in Mei Fun.  The best Mei Fun I have ever gotten was at Ming's Garden in Sandusky.  Since moving to Lorain, I haven't found any Chinese restaurant that makes it great.  I almost found a great place at Jin's House but they add green peppers and the noodles literally are so hard you could break them on the table.  I thought I would try out golden crown. Went there to order and she I told her what I wanted.  I got Mei fun with only about 4 shrimp and full of soy sauce.  This is not the sauce that is used in Mei Fun- not completely.  It was salty and had no taste.  I think giving them a three star might be too generous.  Their rice was cooked the way I like it."}
{"text":"Owner was very rude over the phone. We had eaten here many times previously when we lived near Lorain and will not return due to her attitude the last time we ordered. If you are rude to your customers, you lose business!"}
{"text":"Went here with 4 of my friends today for a total of 5. The woman knows me well and she was very excited to see me with a whole group.  The food was aaaammazzing as always. I'll be back for you!  Haha   Give this place a visit!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with husband, he had pork balls, I had wanton soup, shrimp veggie fried rice, and a kiwi strawberry for drink. Wanton soup was amazing, fried rice a little bland but shrimp were great, will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I have only gotten take out. Quite possibly the best vegetable egg foo yung on the planet. Get the gravy on the side. The shrimp mei fun has the perfect balance of shredded veg, shrimp, and noodle for my liking and supplies me with three meals. Owners are very pleasant."}
{"text":"Their pot stickers are amazing.  I crave those things.  The dipping sauce is like ginger soy and they give you eight of them.  Love, love, love them.  I would go just for them."}
{"text":"Ordered take out last night. Definately worthy of a solid four stars. I have been coming  here for over 30 years, and rarely am I ever disappointed. A Lorain landmark, you have to try Golden Crown!"}
