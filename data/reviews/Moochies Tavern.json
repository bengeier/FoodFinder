{"text":"Sorry not for me ... Ceviche was terrible not even close to a true recipe ... Sorry , I hate to return the  food but please get the recipe right .. Drinks from the bar ware ok we had a beer and a dirty gin martini.. The waiters was great tho can't complain about crevice. ...  I guess to each its own but I wish  for classier places in Mathews."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible if your going to be a bar be a bar!! It's small and they reserve tables we waited a hour with 4 open tables reserved we could have ate and left before the parties ever came!!!!! Poor poor management"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We had a few apps, you gotta try the Mac and cheese bites and flat breads. My wife had the chicken sandwich which she said was really good. I enjoyed the Italian flatbread, will definitely be tempted to get that again the next time we go.  Overall, it's a nice bar and restaurant, lots of beers on tap and bottles, and the service was excellent.  It's also the closest bar to our house which is just an added bonus. We will be back for sure, as this will most likely become our neighborhood bar. It's a nice spot, check it out."}
{"text":"Famous for over-serving drunk patrons. Not cool. None of us are safe on the road in this area after 8 PM."}
{"text":"We just live a few minutes down the road from this place so we frequent here pretty often. Since they have expanded and changed owners it has been awesome. They have a huge menu and so far everything we've tried has been great. We typically get carry out and we've never been disappointed. The times that we have eaten there we have gotten good, friendly service. The patio area is really nice as well."}
{"text":"Great local place with a surprisingly creative and diverse menu. Cocktails are great (nice block ice cubes!) and French Onion soup was a perfect way to start the fall rainy season."}
{"text":"So the first few times here I was impressed. The food was good and service was prompt and attentive. 

Then they expanded and double the size of the inside as well as a significantly larger patio area. Service has taken a dramatic turn.  We have been back many times post expansion attempting to give them a chance for redemption and the trend continues. 

The waitstaff is not attentive and average wait from seating to food is one hour plus.  Our most recent visit was a one hour plus wait for two meals. 

Food is still good, although in busy times the quality dips down. 

Expansion has ruined this place."}
{"text":"We went here once a couple of months ago, and really had a good time. We have been back for lunch every Saturday since. Really nice atmosphere, good food, good prices, and very friendly staff. The chili and onion rings are especially good."}
{"text":"Outside they're was a female vocalist playing, very nice atmosphere. Good to go at this point. Then my wife and I order our dinner. Our side was a salad. Here's the good part, one  of the server's walks outside and goes from table to table asking who ordered whatever dressing. No clue at this point, then my wife's salad comes out. She had to confirm her dressing. Then my Cesar salad comes out ten minutes later. Okay I'm a patient person, I start to cut up my salad and there's a mosque fly in my salad!   I don't want too make a seen so I take my plate to the manager and she offers me another salad. I refused. Then she wanted to give me a gift card, this is after I already started to eat my salad!  I asked about comping the bill. She took off our entries and that's all. I'm retired military and I've eaten what a Billy goat would barf. No worries but, she only comped our dinner. Very disappointed, makes me wonder what else your eating!!!!!!#

{"text":"This is our new local hangout!

We went here once under the old management are weren't impressed. When it changed over to the new folks and was rechristened Moochies, we tried it again. It's one of the local places, some people always at the bar in the middle of the small restaurant at the edge of the shopping plaza. Lots of TVS, booth seating plus a really nice outdoor area that also has games. The perfect neighborhood not-a-dive.
My husband orders the same thing: fried chicken sandwich which is golden brown and crispy and then dunked it a sauce of your choosing (he likes mild which is more like a medium to me). 
I order the same thing 90% of the time! too. Fish and chips.
Yes, fish and chips. 
Being from New England, I ordered fish and chips at the PIZZA place so having it at a tavern-like pace makes perfect sense.
Their version has two golden brown, crunchy fish pieces, a pile of seasoned fries and 2 wonderfully addictive hush puppies. I sometimes mix it up with their burgers which are huge and very good. 
We've gotten to be regulars here and they even know our order. Nice people, a menu that covers pretty much everything but focuses on what people going to places like that want: good wings, lots of interesting appetizers and plenty of choices on tap. 
My one suggestion: I'd like to see a sampler plate for an appetizer. Sometimes you can't choose just one thing and it'd be great to throw together a sampler with a couple hush puppies, some wings, a deviled egg, a couple pig wings, Mac and cheese bites, sweet potato fries...they have some great things to choose from. 
A,good little place, friendly, doing what you want them to do: serving crunchy brown food and a cold drink. Love it."}
{"text":"Longtime Skinnyz fan. Place looks nice and service is as good as ever.   Only suggestion would be to bring back the Grouper (nuggets and sandwich) and Blue Moon on tap."}
{"text":"Came for dinner w wife on Friday night. I'm only giving 2 stars because the waitress was attentive even though she was getting settled into her shift. The food was not good by any stretch. Had chipotle sliders and wild boar sliders. Question if that was even wild boar...it was so overcooked that it was basically dried beef with sweet chili sauce.  Chipotle sliders had a splash of chipotle dry seasoning on them. Was not mixed in w beef. Fries and onion rings were OK...nothing special, nothing bad. Beer and whiskey selection was better than applebees or such, but it's Charlotte and most eateries have the same local stuff.

Very interested to see how this place ends up because it seemed like a bar for older people to drink stubby natty ice bottles and never enjoy the craft beer or whiskey part of the bar. This place was neither a restaurant or bar and needs to decide what it wants to be before it even approaches mediocrity in either category."}
{"text":"First time here this past sat aug 27. the band rocked the house . our server was great despite the big crowd. the crowd was mixed young and not so young like us . LOL. good apps to choose from and what we had was good . we didn't eat dinner but the selection is great too. outside area is huge .  hey consider us regulars . weeeee be back !!"}
{"text":"So far we have been twice, and this place is a 2/2 for me and my family.  The atmosphere is great both at 8ish on a Saturday night with live music and at 6 on a week night without.  The first thing that stands out to me is fresh ingredients.  I ordered the Shrimp Scampi pasta dish and the spinach/mushrooms etc were very fresh.  My wife got the buffalo chicken sliders with onion rings and loved them as did I since she couldn't even finish.  For reference the onions ring are done in a batter similar to a \"blooming onion\" you'd see at a franchise steak place.  The appetizer was also good, the fried mac n cheese.  So a meal for 2 with an appetizer ran $35 and that is a great price imo.

The second time we went we brought more family in tow including my picky 3 yo.  Again they didn't disappoint with a great wait staff making the larger party unnoticed.  We tried fried mushrooms as the app and with the ranch and horse radish sauces it was very good.  I tried the Black Angus sliders which were spot on and very filling.   My mother tried the shrimp tacos and they were very good, only complaint that it needed more shrimp (3 each).  Something we noticed the first tome os they have a very nice and diverse kids menu which is refreshing.  My daughter had steamed broccoli, fresh fruit, and a grilled cheese, she was a happy camper.

Their menu is diverse with lots to choose from.  So I plan to continue to work through their menu and I hope they keep up the consistently great service and food."}
{"text":"Very good will go again with family. My wife was in her happy place the entire time, as was i. 
Thank you"}
{"text":"I come here often.. more for connivence than anything. Ive had good experiences and bad. 

The good- food is pretty good depending on what you get. Deviled eggs are very good and most of the apps. They have good drink specials. The gentleman who is always behind the bar makes good drinks and is attentive. They have bands every week if you like live music but it is very loud so don't expect to go here and have a conversation. Acoustics need work. 

The bad- most of the bartenders seem to be in lala land and it takes effort to get service. The servers could be more attentive too. There is one girl that is really good but i don't remember her name. I wouldn't go for the wine, it always tastes old. Almost every night they have a \"theme\" going on that can be annoying if you don't want to listen to karaoke or open mike bands. If you go on the weekends they have band inside and outside so you cannot escape the noise. I wish they would stick to one. 

All in all they are very busy but i think this is more so because of lack of competition. Not many choices in this area."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from them today, work right in the shopping center and will definitely be ordering again for lunch! Got a make your own wrap (guacamole no extra charge) with sweet potatoe fries and it was great. Friend got turkey bacon wrap and said it was really good as well!"}
{"text":"Love the crazy hot wings. Must try the pig wings too.  And the lobster grilled cheese sandwich"}
{"text":"Good stop on the way from Wilmington to Charlotte area.  Had the lobster grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Service was less than acceptable. Had the buffalo chicken wrap. It was good, but would have been better if my drink hadn't gone empty. Waitress ?Melissa? Kept telling me shed be back with a refill and kept forgetting. However the party next to us had their drinks coming consistently :/ won't be back that's for sure."}
{"text":"I live a mile away and have always longed for a place close by I could get a good beer and some good food.  We visited last week to give it a go...didn't get a beer since I saw the taps and know what they taste like (good selections!) and we wanted to spend more on food. So we ordered:

First we ordered the guacamole deviled eggs, taste was very bland and needed help.  Didn't taste like a deviled egg and didn't really taste like guacamole either...needed something to get it off the fence, maybe lime and a little sea salt or something.

Next we got the Italian flat bread, the topping tasted good but considering on 2 different locations pepperonis were still stacked on each other 5 high I would say someone in the kitchen wasn't paying attention.  The bread was \"sorta\" flat but was still thing and chewy...I assume they get this and just put the toppings on it.  Didn't like the rubbery chew to the bread and it's obvious the bread is bought elsewhere.

Lastly we had the blackened fish tacos and house chips.   Some of the chips were really good and cooked to the browner-burned color I liked, others were VERY undercooked and had grease puddled on them which we didn't eat.  The fish taco's were just awful.  A little seasoning on them, not blackened at all and was a small piece in each taco with a little cabbage and I didn't see any cilantro at all....this and chips for $9???  (I admit when it comes to fish tacos I go to Cabo Fish Taco in NoDa but still....)

Service was very good and attentive, we sat outside which was set up really nice and besides the 3 older guys (regulars you could tell) sitting near the door that were talking like they were a mile apart and cursing like sailors the patio was really nice.

Maybe this was a bad night, not sure as we expected WAY better considering the reviews here.  Were giving it one more shot on the 30th of Aug for the benefit for the 5 year old cancer patient (AWESOME for Moochies to host a fundraiser for this girl!!) we hope for WAY better."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner. Sat and watched waitresses walk by us 3 times without saying a word. Man came in after us and had already placed his order. Finally asked for a menu and told they were coming. After 10 minutes with nothing we left. BAD SERVICE."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , great band , waited at the bar Saturday night for almost 20 minutes for a beer , then waited for my check for 15 minutes and had to leave , me and my visa card , had to come back Monday morning to settle up , came back Tuesday evening and waited for 15 minutes At the bar to order a beer , wanted another and had to stand on my fricking stool to get another , was never offered a menu and been here an hour , bartender is oblivious to me , such a shame , great music , great atmosphere and bartender doesn't care that I have money to spend and I'm going to have to go somewhere else to eat !!


Wow  , they redeemed their selves and the manager was amazing 

Then went back tonight to enjoy the NBA playoffs on Wednesday night , had a couple drinks and was excited to watch the game , 



Darn , at 9 o'clock I asked for the Playoffs and they tried , they have many , many flatscreens , then about 9:10 they said there remotes were broken , sorry , I didn't come to watch old replays of the Super Bowl , planed my whole evening around watching the game , and they said sorry 
Wont be back !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm very mixed about my opinion of this place. We came here on Sunday during the games to grab some food and watch some football. The place was packed and our waitress was completely swamped. Luckily another waiter was able to jump in and take care of us.

The wedge salad was great and so was the blue cheese dressing. It was full of blue cheese crumbles and tasted homemade. It was excellent especially for the price. My dad really liked his side house salad.

The oyster po boy was my meal. The oysters themselves were fried perfectly but I was turned off by the bread. It tasted like they drenched it in margarine or I can't believe it's not butter. I would also like to see them offer a remoulade to go with the po boy. The fries were terrible and tasted like they used bad oil.  My dad got the Reuben. The meat was sliced extremely thick and much thicker than he had expected. The sandwich itself was average. However he absolutely loved the onion rings and so did I. They were perfectly fried and the breading was great. I don't know how the fries tasted so bad and these tasted so good.

Overall hit or miss. I will give it another try. It seems like there are some really amazing items mixed in with some not so great/average ones."}
{"text":"Fabulous make - your - own bloody mary or mimosa on Saturdays and Sundays!  Menu is quite extensive and reasonably priced. You can sit inside or out. Full service bar and TVs make this a great place to catch up with friends or watch a sporting event. Our server Deli was friendly and efficient keeping our drinks refreshed and checking in for anything else we might need. I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Nice, friendly local pub. Food was above average as was the accommodating service.
Both my wife's salad and my grilled chicken sandwich were prepared well."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went there for dinner. We had heard a lot about it and wanted to check it out. The staff was awesome!!!! We had the calamari and wings for aps. It was the best we have ever eaten. Great place to go!!"}
{"text":"Buddy and I went here to have a few brewskis and some food. We ordered the oysters. The cook complained (walked out of kitchen) to us about shucking the oysters. The oysters were gritty, felt like they had sand in them and were not very good. The bartender was not very friendly she seemed rushed. Every time I have went here service and food has been bad but I thought I would give it another chance since it's under new owners."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time since Skinnyz left to have a few beers and enjoy the live band. The band, Cloud 9 was awesome. The place is bigger too. That is definitely a plus. The one issue I had was at the bar where I was seated. I was seated directly in front of the register and the bartender kept acting like I was invisible while she waited on everyone else (I was the only black person at the bar, hope it wasn't a race thing). Finally another bartender sees the trouble I was having and came over and waited on me. My experience got better 10 fold when I moved to a table when my friends arrived. The waitress at the table was fantastic"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends and family. 
Service always seems to be sporadic at best. 
Waitress was great at getting first round of drinks to table.  Appetizer came out quick. 
Second round of drinks (beer and soda) was a bit slower.  Third round....THIRD ROUND!!!.....hello?!!!!  Glasses are empty.  For fifteen minutes no sign of waitress. Finally she comes by and I ask for check.  Ten minutes later I Get the check. 
My patience and relaxing night with the family ended as we waited for refills and the check."}
{"text":"Another great meal @ Moochies. Shrimp and Grits. I still like the wings and burgers the best!"}
{"text":"Moochies is awesome!  This is my favorite local hang out.  You can grab some food and listen to live music on certain nights.  Cool outside area where the band plays outside occasionally.  Large menu with tons of options.  The food does take some time to come out but it's worth it. The WINGS are the best in town!  Go with the bone-in.  Very friendly staff.  Highly recommend Moochies if you are in Matthews!"}
{"text":"Massive improvement since ownership change.  Service has improved dramatically.  Tons of options.  Boneless wings are fantastic as well as Pig Wings (pork shanks in wing sauce....A+).

Good diverse kid menu options.  Super cool ambiance with live music outside.  Great place to have a beer at with good drink specials."}
{"text":"Wow...rudest bartender ever seemed to be in a bad mood. Asked for a Margarita with Patron & salt. Don't have any Patron. Wow...I Asked for a menu and she has never come back to ask me what I wanted. Maybe she over worked or I'm not a regular. 

A guy sits down right beside me and she get him a beer and shot. Me... never addresses me.... Just took my tea away without asking me or addressing me at all. I didn't want more tea... trying to leave as fast as possible.

I told her I was leaving after she hadn't spoken to me in 10 mins. I asked her how much for the tea.. It's free yeaaaa me."}
{"text":"I never get great service here. last time we ordered the ceviche appetizer, stay away, it is  a poor excuse for a dish. the shrimp were from a can, small as can be, the quality is very poor."}
{"text":"Great food, spectacular service! Always packed on tuesday evenings for the Jam and the service... especially in the music room, is fantastic. Some people are unreasonable to expect a personal waitress when the house is full. They do the best they can, really. Maybe before you complain, walk a mile in their shoes."}
{"text":"It was the worst Philly Cheese steak.  It was not even close to a real one. The onion ring was also without much flavor."}
{"text":"We Always enjoy a lunch or dinner here. Great drinks. Nice patio. If you sit inside bring a sweater and a flashlight (it can be dark)."}
{"text":"I've eaten almost everything on the menu one year later and it's been fun! The latest was the Buffalo chicken tender sliders but I asked for Christopher sauce instead. Wonderful though all their sliders are fantastic. My favorite is the Angus Burger sliders with mozarella,  tomato,  basil and balsamic glaze on local bakery, Nova, bun. The lamb sliders and Bison ones are also great."}
{"text":"Customer service excellent but food wise.... I could smell the grease coming off my plate. Fries tasted like old grease and although the lobster salad was good, it wasn't good with the butter saturated toast."}
{"text":"We wandered over early to what we thought was Skinnyz. To our very pleasant surprise this has changed owners. The food was great! We had the calamari app and it was really awesome. One of the best I have had. Then hubby had the salmon which was perfectly cooked. As chicken wing snobs I had to try the \"famous\" moochie wings and they were excellent. 
We will be back! Loved the atmosphere. Small and not many tables."}
{"text":"Very very below average food. Great for drinks. Very spunky and nice servers, very lovely.
Just get there with a full stomach for a few cocktails and fries and you'll love it there. 
New to the area, maybe a California snob writing here but I wanted to believe...Given that they have an unusual, very long list of taco plates that they just may have tasty tacos? No. I was just reminded that we're not in California anymore. Not worth it. Not even the beans or the rice. It all tasted like spicy old el paso taco mix was added in huge amounts into all of it. 
I'd say if you don't know how to cook something, just don't offer it and focus on what you can cook. 

If you insist on making those, May I suggest cole slaw for the tacos? Could do wonders! May I suggest a lime on the fish tacos? It will blow your mind! 
I heard the burger was ok."}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple more times recently since ownership has changed. Looks like they are trying to brighten the place up with a new coat of paint. The food and execution have taken a step back, however. Looks like they are now ordering pre made frozen burger patties. Also, leaving ingredients off entrees that are written on the menu has happened the last couple visits. We were there with the kids and left just before the band started playing, which was a good thing since they had set up a large speaker next to our table. I'm still wondering what target audience they are looking for. Is it a bar with live music that serves sub par food? If so, I can see why the previous owners went a different direction with their other restaurant concept located in the same shopping center. I will say that both times we have been there since the ownership change, the service has been very friendly. I think the things that they struggle with are easy to overcome and hope they get it straightened out. We would love to have a decent neighborhood place to go with the kids without having to drive a longer distance.Our bill is about $100 each time we go out and I imaging there are other families that would spend the same. Sounds like a good target audience to me."}
{"text":"Love it!!   Great waitress brought 2 sample beers to try. Ended up having a mango something that was delicious.   My shrimp n burger was fantastic!   She had a kids burger and said it was very good.  Looks like deserts are worth a stop in for."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I was at this little corner restaurant.  It had only just reopened as Moochies and had only just started service. Roll ahead a few years and here I am extremely pleased. 

We got here on a Monday evening and they were reasonably busy. The atmosphere was pleasant and upbeat with a good mix of popular music. 

We were sat right away in the newer broken out section. Our drinks were taken and delivered right away. Very tasty mixed drinks. My wife had the Raspberry Lemon Drop. 

We shared a dozen medium buffalo wings that were a good size, crispy and saucy.  Great dippers. It was served hot and fast. 

The food was well presented and tasty. I had the honey siracha tacos. Yum. 

My wife had the tilapia sandwich.  It was tender, flaky, and flavorful.  

The kids enjoyed their meals. (Kids hotdog and hamburger with fries) 

We all shared the Brookie, a very large brownie/cookie with ice cream and whipped cream, with caramel and chocolate drizzled over top. 

All said and done, I am going home with a full belly and happy family. I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been there three times now, it's always been friendly and the staff is attentive. I've tried a couple of menu items and the food was good.  The pig wings are really good.  
This is a great place to have a beer and a bite to eat after golfing. I wish they had the NoDa beers on tap. I've asked before and have heard others ask for them in the past."}
{"text":"This place definitely gets a better score for the location since it's right around the corner for us. The fact that they happen to have excellent food doesn't hurt either. There's been a handful of times where certain side items have been questionable, but they've always wiling to remake them for us. The hush puppies and onion rings are our favorites!! Every main dish we've ordered from the menu has been fantastic from build your own burger/ wrap/ chicken sandwich to Reuben, lobster grilled cheese, fish tacos and much more. It tends to get a bit busy/loud here, but if you're OK with that then I'd absolutely recommend giving this place a try. You shouldn't be disappointed despite a possible wait and/or noise level; as long as you're prepared."}
{"text":"we ordered several apps and the ceviche appetizer, worst excuse for ceviche ever, the shrimp were out of a can, they were krill, as small as you would find in an eggroll. no thanks"}
{"text":"Wow...am I at the Beach!! I just had the best Soft Shell Crab Sandwich Ever!  It was a HUGE Softshell Crab - fried with a great crust, served on a Brioche bun with beautiful leaf lettuce a huge slice of Tomato and some buttery sauce!  Really one of the best ones in my whole life. This is a Steelers Sports Bar..with live music and a huge menu. Their Beer menu is full of great Local Craft beer..including Wooden Robot which I adore! Great Patio area and it is always a fun bar. They are also famous for their Huge Chicken sandwich, which my husband and son got with a Bourbon Butter sauce! They have lots of appetizers and burger and wraps. This place is in a Strip Mall ..Lots of TV's for Sports fanatics too! Try it...its great!"}
{"text":"My family had the shrimp scampi, chicken sandwich and kids pasta. The pasta was fine but my brioche bread was not fresh and the chicken didn't taste fresh either. The onion rings were good but cold and cut way too thick.. The waitress was great so I'm giving three stars. Why offer a children's menu but no changing table in the restroom?"}
{"text":"This is an ugly bar. The FOOD is actually surprisingly good but it's very loud and the service while friendly is very slow. The décor is horrendous. An OK place to drink mainly due to lack of competition."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had blackened chicken wrap with onion rings. The food was great and so was the service and atmosphere. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Food is good for bar food in Matthews staff is friendly and attentive and they're trying to  bring in a bit of higher end whiskey ok by me"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years, the service seems to be getting worse.  I go here because I know the owners and like giving them business but I'm not sure I'm going to come back.  It took over 1 hr to get our food on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but the kitchen seems to struggle and that's what makes it hard.  Wait staff are overall awesome however, food constantly come out wrong, cold, late, etc.  The owner, Rhonda, is awesome, attentive and cares.  Love the food, great beer selection and live bands are an added bonus.  I truly think this place will one day rock but the kitchen needs to get it together."}
{"text":"Start to finish, a horrible experience. Waited almost five minutes at the hostess table before finally resorting to flagging someone down to seat us. Drinks arrived promptly, waitress said she'd return \"in a minute\" to take our appetizer order. Nearly eight minutes later, she returned. We decided to err on the side of caution and order the appetizer and entrees at the same time. When the appetizer came out, we were given no napkins, no silverware and had to ask for small plates. THREE plates (mismatched sizes) were brought out for our party of SIX. Still no napkins or silverware. Food arrived and again, we had to ASK for silverware and napkins. Hard to eat a salad or Mac and Cheese without a fork. Pretty messy to eat wings without napkins. The Cobb salad was served with a paltry two slices of avocado which were hard, they were dark green....the avocado clearly wasn't ripe and should not have been served. The macaroni and cheese that came with one of the kid's meals was inedible. The cheese (which we were told was queso cheese, but it couldn't possibly have been.) was chalky and tasteless. The chicken strips had no seasoning at all. The restaurant was not busy. I don't understand why service was so slow and why the food was so subpar. The server did remove the kid's meal with the Mac and cheese from the bill, but it was too little, too late by that point. We won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"We always have a great time here..they are pet friendly so we get to bring our pup. They even bring out a bowl of water for him. Very nice staff and food is great as well"}
{"text":"While there may have not been many cosmetic changes to the old Skinnyz, there apparently have been some updates to the rest of the place, as Moochies appears to be packed about all the time. A recent example: We were there on a recent weekend afternoon and the place was packed. At 4pm. With no sports. No important sports anyway. And it was not a holiday (Mothers/Fathers/etc Day).

Just a whole bunch of people who seemed genuinely interested in the place. Impressive, really.

Service was friendly, if not excessively speedy or over-the-top in any way. If there is any downside it is that the menu has a good number of options, and though most of them are of the fairly familiar fast casual sort, getting some direction from the wait staff would be nice, rather than \"I haven't tried that\" on just about everything. Still, most everything is served up quickly, and it is good - but some more in this area would be nice.

Interestingly rather than your typical Applebees fare you can even find things like Gator Po Boys. So you can explore your wild side. Not a lot of gator on them, but it is definitely interesting. Or you can sit around the bar if that is more your speed."}
{"text":"To sum it up, it is a perfect local watering hole. Bar food is good and drinks specials are always on point. They recently extended into the building next to it, and really opens up the area more than before. If you're looking for a great local drink and bar food spot with friendly bartenders, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Okay, so my two friends and I decided to come in here last night for drinks and food.  Needless to say it was an excellent experience. We ordered wings, fried pickles, and deviled eggs.  While I wasnt a fan of the eggs my buddy liked them, so I guess they just werent for me. Anyways all the other food was great. We ordered alot of drinks and they all came to us in a very timely manner, which was very suprising seeing as they were swamped. Our waitress christa went above and beyond to make sure we had what we needed and constantly checked in on us. There wasnt a time where we were sitting around waiting for her to come to us. Also they had a great live band playing. Thank you moochies for the great experience, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Staff is nice as the first time we were here.  I wish they can seat us on the booth, or table but high chairs with our kids."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here.  Came on a Sunday evening this time for a jeep event.  No panthers game going on but it was fairly full.  Service was absolutely atrocious.  Our waiter never even greeted us.  Hostess ended up getting us drinks and took order after we sat for 20 minutes. After 45 minutes our food finally came.  Compound the terrible service with some merry go round of terrible bands going through blasting music way too loud . Couldn't get out of the place quick enough.  Food was good, but kids meal was lukewarm.  Thankfully my kid isn't picky.  Probably won't be back after that experience.  

Came again, service was on point.  Food was awesome!  Honey sriracha chicken tacos were wonderful and flavorful."}
{"text":"This little dive, has some unexpectedly awesome food.
The \"Truffle Deviled Eggs\" are to die for. Seriously some of the best in Charlotte.
I had the blackened shrimp tacos with sweet potato fries. The portion was awesome and the quality of the food was great! Also some of the best sweet potato fries in Charlotte. 
Our bartenders were very friendly, and they made a great margarita!

We came on a Tuesday evening, so it was open mic night. So much great talent in this bar! I wouldn't go up there unless you got serious skill, because this isn't amateur hour. Also Tuesday's are $4 margaritas!!!

You really can't go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"Nice place with outdoor seating, average food, super nice waitstaff. 

Parking lot, casual, lots of bikers, tv's, Bloody Mary/Mimosa bar on Sun., full bar"}
{"text":"They just started serving breakfast Friday-Sunday and the word really hasn't gotten out yet.  Please give them a shot.  We went there this morning and were very pleasantly surprised.  We expected a very basic menu, but we were wrong.  It is quite varied.  I had the Eggs in a Basket with bacon and home fries.  The Eggs were perfectly cooked and the bacon was very good.  The home fries were the big surprise.  Soft but still with some texture and had peppers and onions and a little bit of a bite to them.  Not enough of a bite to mask the other flavors but enough to notice.
My wife had the Bananas Foster Waffle after the server recommended the waffles.  The waffle was light and fluffy and had just enough of the bananas and sauce.
In an area that has several breakfast places that are worthy, we will be making Moochie's part of our weekend rotation."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch and want to go back.    Service was friendly, quick and food was very good.   Had the squealer burger, pork and beef patty with pulled pork and BBQ sauce!  Excellent! The chili I had as a side was also thick and tasty. Others in my group had steak sandwiches which were also very good.   Worth trying!"}
{"text":"second time there last night, and it did not disappoint.  Food is consistently excellent at very fair prices, the wait staff is very attentive and as a bonus we caught the live music !
I'll definitely be back! :-)"}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre. I've tried it on several occasions. I would eat here again but it would be more due to convenience. I haven't tried the brunch but intend to do so."}
{"text":"Good place to go to grab some good food and cheap beer. Plenty of TV's to keep an eye on the games. Outdoor seating is a plus too."}
{"text":"Very good food & prices. The servers can sometimes be unfriendly and not very attentive to their table. But other than that, my experiences have been great & I've never had to wait very long on a table."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place two stars is because their server was great and attentive.  The  bar was very cold and dark.  My husbands food was mediocre.   I was disappointed in mine as I did not get what I ordered. Asked for no onions or peppers and got those.  Asked for lettuce, tomato, mayo and mustard and didn't get any of those items.  I saw the waiter write it down but the kitchen ignored it.  I'll pass on going back."}
{"text":"Stick to the basics on their menu. Don't get fancy...otherwise you'll be disappointed. I got the oyster po boy and maybe they were canned but the were as chewy as bubble gum. My wife got ceviche which also disappointed. Very ambitious menu...but  bad execution."}
{"text":"Love this place! We typically get our food to go - mostly wings on Sunday. But the wings are delicious - big and juicy! When I went tonight to pick up our order, I noticed that if you dine in, it's BOGO! That's definitely a win for football Sundays, but since mine was to go, it was .75 each. Overall, food is good and service is good."}
{"text":"Good variety of food that is quality. Recommend the Bison Sliders or the Lobster Salad Sandwich.  Nice patio area that provided a very good atmosphere to listen to some quality music while we ate and drank. Pretty decent beer (for me) and wine selection for those that like a variety of craft beers.  Indoor stage, bar and atmosphere make this a nice little kind of hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great place with live music most of time! Family friendly and carefully prepared dishes. Great attentive staff with outside patio seating. Right off 485 Idlewild rd exit. Will frequent!"}
{"text":"Had an absolutely embarrassing time at this place.  Accused of not paying.  Check with your waitresses next time before accusing me of not paying.  Had to show the bank receipt before they checked their records and the waitress.  Moochies made this right, sent apologies and stepped up to talk to the waitress that embarrassed my girlfriend."}
{"text":"I was a but shocked to find skinnyz transformed into a new tavern.  The changes on the inside are mostly cosmetic and probably for the better.  Modern meets old in a neighborhood bar feel.  According to our waitress the place stayed open during renovations and will have a grand reopening party on 2/22/2014.

The menu is a bit different which soups and sandwiches.  There is heartier fare and entrees to order: fish and chips and steak options on the menus. The app that caught my eye were the truffle deviled eggs which I will be trying soon.

I do miss the large beach chair booths but they used them in their remodel."}
{"text":"A great place to hide out and eat some good food!

I went here with some friends and my three month old on Mother's Day and we all had a great time.  The staff is friendly and enthusiastic and the atmosphere is very relaxed and kid friendly.  I ordered a burger and sweet potato fries and they knocked both out of the park.

The location is great with both indoor and outdoor seating, and they're definitely doing something right because there are always cars outside.  I'll definitely be going back to this place!"}
