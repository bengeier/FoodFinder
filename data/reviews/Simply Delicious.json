{"text":"Pros: lots of sweet hot gulab jamun, tender meats, great crispy naan made fresh on request for no extra charge, lovely mango ice cream, only $10 for the lunch buffet

Cons: barely any flavour. I'm surprised the owners don't notice this, considering that they eat the same food for lunch.

Wouldn't bother going back. Indian Cuisine at Yonge/Hilda is way better for a couple dollars more."}
{"text":"This restaurant may be called \"simply delicious\" but their food should be called \"simply unfathomable\".  I've eaten so many different dishes on the menu (not that I had any choice in the matter) and each dish tastes like mulligan stew made in the back of an alley by some hobos.  If they offered their food to the malnourished kids in Madaya, Syria, those kids would probably take one bite and say, \"no thanks\".  Every dish is basically mystery meat in a puddle of oil along with some rice, and I bet if Morgan Spurlock made his next 30-day diet movie eating at this restaurant he wouldn't live to tell the tale of it. It's easy to see why they have to price their food cheaper than McDonald's. 

I would not recommend eating here unless you actually want to have the \"mulligan stew experience\". Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"I wasn't here by choice, meaning I didn't select this as the place to cater the food. Did the cooks even go to culinary school?

Pilau was mediocre, pieces of stew beef not tender rather chewy. Channa curry was the most bland saag I've ever had, my girlfriend can cook better, curry packages taste better than this.

Oh and a little side note, the entrance to this place was vandalised overnight before we arrived. Some thugs threw rocks the size of basketballs through the glass windows. Glass wasn't cleaned up by the time we arrived, rear entrance was opened with very high stairs, no ramp for seniors. We helped some up before I got pissed enough to tell the manager they need to open up the main entrance."}
{"text":"Simply Delicious is...simply delicious! I really don't understand the past reviews or why it hasn't been reviewed since 2016, but this place is goooood! 

I got recommendations to visit from many family members and friends, so decided to venture in one weekday for lunch. It's a bit hidden on woodbine amongst the business buildings, so keep an eye out for the '7580' signage and you know you're in the right spot. 

I came early just when the restaurant opened, and the buffet was ready to go with piping hot dishes. The restaurant is clean and has a classic appearance. Since it's a buffet once you're seated you can head right to the food. I started off with some appetizers like samosas and pakoras. They also have bhel puri, which is a traditional Indian street food served with chick peas. 

They have a handful of veggie and meat dishes, and since it was halal I could eat the chicken and meat which was great! The food was quite tasty and filling. Having recently visited India, I can confirm the flavours here are pretty authentic. 

The food is not overly spicy either. And the best part is, it's only $10 for weekday buffet lunch! Such a good price. The owners are also really friendly and continuously brought fresh naan to the table. 

Definitely a solid spot for lunch!"}
