{"text":"Recently I attended an event put on by one of Pittsburgh's 50 Finest.  This is a fundraising venture put on annually by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Western PA.  A proud alumni of the class of 2013, I know the amount of hard work that goes into hosting such an event.  However, the reward is so great because 100% of proceeds go to research in finding a cure for Cystic Fibrosis.  D'Imperio's is a family owned italian restaurant located in Monroeville, PA.  Along Business Route 22, it is a short drive from 376E, one exit after Churchill.  Linda Ferraro, a dear friend and colleague from my work at UPMC, hosted the event.  She met with the friendly owner, Tony D'Imperio, to discuss menu, layout and flow of the event space, and a few other items.  The weather was beautiful and allowed for the back deck, enclosed with over 15+ slate bistro dining tables, mounds of fresh potted flowers, and a sound system to be the stage for the event.  Linda chose a playlist that included Frank Sinatra, Michael Buble, Andrea Bocelli and several other crooners to fill the energy of this polished event.  The menu included a robust line-up of fresh fruit, vegetables, greens and beans (made specifically with romaine in order to cut down the heavy nature that escarole traditionally provides), bruschetta, meatballs with sauce and so much more.  Linda worked with local vendors to create her own cocktail, the \"Linda Limoncello\" martini.  All proceeds from the sale of this specific drink went to her fundraising total for the night.  As the crowd started to arrive, drinks were flowing and people started to partake in the raffle and 50/50 activities that collectively added to the night's fundraising total.  Angie Kinney, mother of 2 daughter's with Cystic Fibrosis, addressed the crowd about this disease.  The guest of honor was her 16 year-old daughter who helped pick all raffle winners later that evening.  Lucky guests went home with packages from Massage Envy, Brewstone Beer Company, Monterrey Bay, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium and many more items.  The winner of the 50/50 was playfully challenged to donate back some of his earnings, only to give all by $1 of the $200 jackpot.  The crowd immediately cheered on his generosity.  Mr. D'Imperio and his staff were knowledgeable, friendly and attentive to the over 60+ crowd who came out to support Ms. Ferraro in this grand occasion.  Although the event was scheduled to end at 10, many people stayed with no pressure from staff to finish beverages and mingle about the night's success.  If you want to book your next event at D'Imperio's, please do not hesitate to contact them."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and absolutely terrible service. Other than that a wonderful place! It really is for the old folks, and I'm 55! If I didn't have to attend for a function it would have been the last place in Monroeville I would have went."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had time without kids Saturday night and were starving--so he suggested D'Imperio's.  Based on what I have read/heard, I have to say that I thought we would be walking in to an episode of the Godfather at 70+.  I'm happy to say, we did not!    The restaurant was booming--one room had a band playing, the bar was hopping, there was a private party going on in one dining room, and in the last dining room were regular diners like us!  All of them our age (40 something) or younger.    We had stuffed mushrooms and dinner salads.  There were only four mushrooms, but they were scrumptious. The house tossed salads were good but nothing special.  Hubby had a seafood egg noodle pasta dish that was loaded with fresh seafood in a creamy tomato sauce, he loved it.  I had an eggplant appetizer stuffed with mozzarella cheese that was good as well.    I would definitely go back for good Italian food.  Not only for old fogies!"}
{"text":"D'-mperios is a fine place and I've been to some of the best in the world Espadon Ritz Paris comes to mind..,now I'm not comparing them but you can do much worse than Dimpys..Tony the owner is a totally class act..have Omar or Elena make you a drink..have Amy ,Mary or any other of their great servers take care of you.Anyone on this site who disses this restaurant needs as serious reality check.

{"text":"The place screams old-school Italian in a dated but kind of charming way. Started with the Seafood Bisque. Asked the waitress what type of seafood is used, and she was kind enough to get the answer from the kitchen (shrimp shells/tails and crab stock). Was not very Italian - more French in technique with a rich creaminess balanced by a splash of dry sherry - it was awesome, could have eaten a few bowls! My sister had the Caesar Salad, crisp and appropriately dressed. Nice little salad but nothing to brag about. We split the Crab Bruschetta - six small pieces of toasted Italian bread with a modest amount of jumbo lump crabmeat on each. The crab was tossed in olive oil, tarragon vinegar, and cracked black pepper. Not what I was expecting...very light and tasty.   For my main course I had the Filet. It was cooked correctly, seasoned sufficiently, and very tender. The beef is not grass fed, but it is from PA and fresh. My sister had the New Zealand Lamb Chops. They were cooked beautifully and nicely seasoned. Both orders came with a Baked Potato (with an obscene amount of butter and sour cream on the side), and a pedestrian vegetable medley. The proteins were defiantly the stars here.   For dessert I had a decent Tiramisu. Sis had a cold Godiva souffl√©, which was REALLY good. If your a choco-holic you must try! Extensive wine list with Italian, French and domestic options, ranging from reasonable to very expensive. Two glasses of Chianti ran us $14.50. They also have a surprisingly nice selection of bourbon with a half-dozen quality options. I had a glass of Jim Beam Black Label with my steak since Sis was paying!     Overall a solidly above-average dinning experience with good service. A nice choice for people looking to avoid chain restaurants in Monroeville."}
{"text":"Went to D'Imperios for valentines day dinner. thought I would take my wife to a \"nice\" dinner. when we walked in, we realized that we were the youngest people there by at least 30 years. we were greeted and sat promptly. the decor was very 1980's Italian American. there was a special valentines day menu, so in the interest of being fair, it wasn't the everyday menu. I selected \"Crustacean in concert\" puff pastry with lobster sauce, it was OK. my wife had sausage stuffed mushroom caps, and the sausage was similar to cheap ground sausage you would get on a slice of pizza. we both had seafood bisque for our soup, and it was OK, but heavy. heres where the dinner got awful. i got pan seared duck with currant sauce, and my wife got chicken mushroom Marsala, both served with squash and risotto. my two duck breasts were not cooked well (varying degrees of doneness) and soggy duck skin. my wifes Marsala was overly salty, and the sauce was more soy than marsala. both of our entrees were cold. the risotto was very undercooked, and the rice was too al dente. my wife ordered the chocolate mousse cake for dessert, and i the rum cake. my wife was informed that all of the mousse cake was frozen, so she opted for the chocolate souffle, both desserts we had were good, but i believe to have been made elsewhere. I had 1 scotch, and my wife had 1 beer, and our total bill (with tip already included) was $113! i dont have a problem with paying for good food, but the quality of the food did not meet the price. will not go back."}
{"text":"I will give their SEAFOOD BISQUE 6 STARS!  Incredible!  But the rest was just ok. Pretty expensive too. Definitely old lady bar type of place.... Not updated since prob the eighties.... Time to step into the present guys.... If you don't, i can see you closing in a year.... Two tops!"}
{"text":"Valentine's day.   Food was average, and service was *terrible.*   The couple at the table next to ours actually walked out after waiting a very long time to even give their orders to the waiter.  I think we had the worst server in the place, so maybe not fair to judge the restaurant by him... but the food was just ok, and he was beyond bad.  I doubt that we will go back."}
{"text":"Called on Saturday to see if we needed a reservation. They had two parties but said we could come in early and we could have a table. They were very nice to us. Though it took a little bit longer for our meal to be prepared it was delicious. They even offered to give us dessert on the house because of the wait. We will be going back."}
{"text":"closed!!!  The restaurant is closed.  It is for sale. It's sad to see a restaurant sitting empty...vacant. It was a place where people celebrated all kinds of special occasions.  And while it isn't boarded up...it could be."}
{"text":"I am not surprised to find this review not entered, because I imagine the average clientele to be 70+ and probably not too aware of the \"internets\".  This place oozes old school.  I've been here a few times for lunch and have always been pretty happy with the food.  I went here yesterday, with a colleague Mike.  It's located in Penn Center right off of 376.  The interior is super outdated.  They opened about 30 years ago and I can pretty much guarantee everything from the silverware to the pictures on the wall haven't been updated since.  It's pretty large and probably woud be a great place to take your grandparents.  The ceilings are a delightful tinted brown from years of cigar and cigarette smoke and the pictures fit perfectly.  I even think there's one of dogs playing poker.  The service is always professional.  These are not college kids working there way through, but folks who pay their mortgage and know how to serve.  The wait can be long if you are in groups, but yesterday was less than an hour.  They start you with delicious perfectly toasted garlic bread.  This is a real nice old school touch.  I also tried there seafood chowder which is tasty, but only because its cream, butter and pretty tasteless fish.  I tried the scallops yesterday and to my surprise they were tender, cooked perfectly, and had a flavorful seasoning.  The veggies were bland, overcooed, and tasteless.  I've literally had better much better at boston market, Mike got a steak salad which was a healthy portion cooked medium (just as he'd asked) and he seemed pleased.  I've tried pasta here before and a burger.  It's not fine dining, but it does have its charm and I'd go back again."}
