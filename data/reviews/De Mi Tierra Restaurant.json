{"text":"Incredible food! This is one of the hidden places in Phoenix. Their menu changes every week and provides the customers with delicious options! A must stop"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try it out and we went find out that theirs no location for it.. we drove around in a circle to see if it was hidden and their was nothing.. very disappointed 
I wish I can rate a 0 star"}
{"text":"Food was good, on the salty side, but flavors were ok.
Ordered a Bolon de verde con Chicharrones, caldo de Patas and Encocado de Pescado.
Best of all was the bolon! So yummy! I amost felt like i was in La playa, and only was missing a cup of coffee or a Pilsener! 
Recomendend to not only Ecuadorians, but anyone that want to try something different and Rico!"}
{"text":"Productos latinoamericanos.
De Argentina compré: Yerba mate, tapas de empanadas, alfajores, savora, celusal, para las fiestas tenian pan dulce y más.
Muestran los partidos de fútbol  y organizan diferentes eventos (juegos de cartas, reuniones).
Los precios (de ciertos productos argentinos al menos) no son muy competitivos, he encontrado mejores precios en otros lugares."}
{"text":"Great place!
I came here as my wife is a fan of Peruvian food. Food is very flavorful. Portions are huge. I disagree with one of the reviewers saying that the empanadas were a MUST here. They're OK. Nothing worth writing to your Parole Officer for.

My only knock on them is that they never offered to refill our drinks. It's a minor knock since we really didn't want more, but it's always nice to get that little extra effort from the wait staff. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, the menu does not reflect the actual type of food being served. A Churrasco is a piece of beef \"skirt\" grilled. After complaining to waiter, he apologized and said is an Ecuadorian churrasco style which was not stated in the menu. However, the meat was rough and had a lot of fat. Was not grilled. We also ordered shrimps which were the frozen ones and hard to chew, horrible. The red bean had no seasoning.  Our first and last time."}
{"text":"De Mi Tierra Restaurant is a small not too fancy but comfortable casual restaurant that serves Latin Food. This restaurant is located in an older small strip mall. The menu showcases dishes from Ecuador, Peru, Puerto Ricco and The Dominican Republic. Latin Posters are on the walls and Latin Food TV was playing.

We started by sharing a Chicken Empanada. The Empanada was large and was stuffed with very tender and VERY FLAVORFUL moist delicious chicken. The pastry was slightly greasy but had this really nice bubbly crisp crust. This is a must get dish and is a really nice bargain for only (at the time of this review) $3.50.

I tried the Pollo Guisado. From what I read this is the staple of meat dishes from the Dominican Republic. It was carefully stewed mostly chicken legs. I do note I never had this dish before so I don't know how it compares to others but I can tell you the chicken was prepared to perfection and the flavors were very balanced. I had yellow rice studded with pigeon peas with my meal. They gave me a very large portion and the rice was flavorful.

My husband tried the Chicharron De Pollo or what you would call Fried Chicken. The chicken was moist with a nice natural chicken flavor. The skin had a minimal coating with crispy skin. This was a Dominican Republic Style Fried Chicken but to me it just seemed like good fried chicken from anywhere. My husband picked the white rice with red bean stew for his side. The beans were like a bean soup and they gave a very large portion of white rice.

Service was efficient.

Prices are low portions are large.

Interesting little stop that gives you the feeling you traveled to South America."}
{"text":"Great place. The food is delicious and the two guys that run it do a great job!
I've been there twice now and I intend to continue going there."}
{"text":"Opened up several weeks ago in my neighborhood in a little strip mall.  So far ever restaurant that opened there has died.  Hoping this one makes it.

The restaurant is small, clean and basic. Nothing fancy.  Reminds me of family owned restaurants I visited in South America.  This one specializes in foods of Ecuador, Peru, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.

The restaurant didn't have any English menus yet, but since I recognized most of the dishes I didn't have a problem.  The wait staff was very polite and eager to describe every dish.

I tried the Carne Guisado which is beef stew.  This version didn't have any vegetable, only chunks of beef.  The stew was very savory and came with rice, beans and some greens.  It was nice and filling.
 
I'll be going again in a few days and reporting back.  Usually I like to try several dishes before I form an opinion, but so far everything looks good.

****  7/10/16 ****
Tried the Arroz con Camaron which was delicious.  It was a large plate of deliciously flavored rice with about 9-10 small de-veined, de-shelled shrimps mixed in the rice.  On the top of the rice was a head-on, shell-on larger shrimp completing the picture.  I wish there was less rice so the shrimp to rice ratio was better.  The dish was extremely filling. 

Maybe smaller plates would be nice for smaller eaters.  There's a senior center across the street from the restaurant.  Most senior citizen don't eat very much.  I would think they would appreciate smaller plates along with lower prices.

They also got an English menu now.  Looks like they increased the prices on certain things since I examined the Spanish menu."}
{"text":"I love the food they make really good great service. Many different product from Latin America"}
{"text":"Sadly i was horrified at this restaurant. I feel this to be one of the worse representations of peruvian food. All the fried food tasted the same. The picada was not like the picture. The lomo tasted bad and fries were still frozen in the middle, the incakola was served plain with no gas . Perhaps served from a two litter soda bottle. Just a total no no. Very sad to have to write this review. Only thing was half decent was the ecuadorian bolon."}
{"text":"Empanadas are great - go for the beef, it will not disappoint! Pernil entree was awesome (get a side - or two - of the spicy sauce). If you're craving a little sweet, try the deep fried plantain appetizer. So good! Hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"I really, really wish I could give this place a good review but I would just be lying. The service here is great and the people that run the business are kind but the food is just not there. I'm Colombian and Cuban and I grew up in an area where you can find all types of Latin American food. I ordered a Mofongo with Chicken and a Churrasco steak??? Churrasco is supposed to be a grilled skirt steak usually served with a chimichurri sauce..this is standard amongst all preparations whether Cuban or Argentinian. Not sure what cut of steak was served to us but it was not Churrasco and it tasted of straight soy sauce. The Mofongo was OK it could use a little more Mojo sauce and the chicken that came with it was the best part of my meal. Hope they change up their recipes because that's the only way I'm trying them again."}
{"text":"We drove out to try De Mi Tierra on a Saturday and arrived a few minutes after 7pm. Their website and their door both say they're open until 9pm on saturdays, but the doors were chained up. Really disappointing, as we drove 40 minutes from the west valley just to try it. Make sure to call to check to find out if they're open!"}
