{"text":"I thought the pho here was ok. I came on a recommendation but didn't find the broth a standout. I did notice that it was empty at dinner time on a weeknight but filled up when we finished around 9pm."}
{"text":"They say the best places are the ones that are hidden in little shacks and huts. Well this place doesn't get more true to that saying. It is small, hidden, and tight. But they have the best tasting Vietnamese noodle soups in town. Being one of my native pallet cuisine's, I get picky with Vietnamese food, usually my AUTHENTIC places are in the west end of Toronto, near Jane and Finch. Don't ask why the best Viet food is always in the rundown ghetto, just usually go eat and bounce.   Now this place Bong Lua is pretty unique. Aside from the traditional Pho, Bun, Com, they actually have  signature dish. It is called \"Bun Dap\" literally sounds like what is spelt there, it consists of a \"guon\" cold rolls with a twist. You get to choose the grilled meat you want, then inside has Lettuce, pickled carrots, vermicelli, herbs, peanuts, smaller thinner rice paper, and shrimp crackers. When you dip this \"Noc Mum\" fish sauce, crunch of the cracker and veggies and grilled meat is very satisfying. You may think \"Damn too many layers and must be a mix of confusing textures\". NOPE! It actually works very well, when you are still able to differentiate the different layers, and flavours. 1 order is enough to share for 2-4 people as an app and enough for 1 to be a meal. Almost like a BIG MAKI roll, but Viet and lighter! Oh and try their curry goat/lamb, it is very on point and satisfying. They make so many homemade dishes that a lot of restaurants don't make.  Overall this restaurant is awesome! soups on point, quality is consistent, and portions are HUGE! if you go as a couple I suggest get 1 regular size noodle and 1 app, it is more then enough food for 2. If you do feel ambitious to order the larger bowl then, please let your friends know they will need to carry you out.   Friendly reminder, they don't take reservations, and it is a small place, but people come and go fast. Spare some time to wait during peak hours, and they dont open late, but it is well worth the time and money."}
{"text":"Place was recommended by a friend.   Surprisingly good pho here and the price is very decent.   The pho soup needed a little more salt (but ppl have told me I eat very salty) so maybe the soup is right for the general public.    Meat in pho was pretty good as well.   They were pretty generous in the portion (not like other places where you see only 3 slices).    Also ordered bun bo hue.  Soup could've been more spicy (but than again,  I like to eat very spicy too).    Will I come back... if in the area,  yes.  I will also recommend this place to friends and family if they are in the area."}
{"text":"The food quality was amazing and the price for a bowl of pho is very reasonable! I can tell the meat quality is pretty good compared to other pho places like pho 88! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Pho here, it's one of a very few that you have an option to get egg noodles. The broth tastes balanced as well not as oily as a lot of other places. Decent serving size I'd say just right but you won't be extreme full so I'd suggest getting the fried spring rolls which I like also because they use chicken for the meat instead of pork. Tried the chicken Pho also and pretty good. We've made this our go to Pho place in Scarborough now."}
{"text":"I was just at this place and it's Saturday  August 19th @ 6:50pm. And I got to say I did not even get the chance to try any food because I had to wait so long and when finally the first appetizer dish arrived, deep fried spring rolls, we had to ask for the fish sauce to dip. 10 minutes went by and we still could not receive the dip for the spring rolls. Then I noticed that the table next to me had a couple waiting for their food as well and they had been there before we had arrived. So I asked how long have they been waiting and they said 25 mins, Just for 2 bowls of Pho! So any Asian or Pho eaters know that these restaurants already have the soup prepared, so the question is how come they couldn't get their order within a timely fashion? At this point my wife daughter And I just got up and left. So I cannot really give a accurate review on the food, But it's obvious when it comes to the dinner rush these people are not able to function properly. Not professional at all. Just a bunch of blank stares and dumb looks on their faces. I wouldn't go back just because of the service."}
{"text":"Pho is great and very filling for it's price. Has become my go to place for pho and Vietnamese food in general. Waiter had some trouble with the order, seems like she wasn't very experienced with English so I ended up with an extra large instead of just a large, but it wasn't a major issue. Can get a little crowded in there sometimes though."}
{"text":"I really only order xl pho at viet restaurants. With that said, unsatisfactory due to the portion (meat, noodles etc.), size of the bowl and overall taste of their house special. Cozy little nook though."}
{"text":"Horrendous service. Servers forget orders, do not communicate clearly, need constant reminders for simple services such as water or extra plates, and provided countless other frustrations.   We ordered some shrimp rolls, regular pho and a coffee and the result was a forty minute wait with a wrong order coming to our table, which belonged to the table next to us who had waited an hour for their dish. To add insult to injury,  we had ordered curry lamb for takeout when we initially ordered, yet forty minutes later after finishing our meal we had to wait yet another ten.   While the food was delicious, the service left a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Okay...the extra star for close proximity to my house...and the way they just know me...(by my number #119 with \"ho fun\" rice noodles). My weekly vietnamese go-to where none of the dishes have ever disappointed me. Delightful shrimp rice rolls, they also have a GInormous rice roll with shrimp crackers and your choice of meat all rolled into one!   Sometimes service is slow..but I do appreciate a simple family run restaurant serving homey food :) plus who doesn't like it when they remember your regular order?"}
{"text":"Decided to go here... Yelp had good reviews.   Got there with the family and found the place very small. Waited 10 minutes for a table.  Place was busy and it felt like they needed more staff to accommodate the guests.  Ordered 3 rice dishes and soup.  Took 30 minutes for our order...Lots of ppl and tons of dirty tables to be cleaned to sit down waiting guests.  Food came finally and it looked good plate wise.  Lemon grass chix and pork needed more flavours plus the springroll wasn't good.  It tasted so different from all the Vietnamese rolls I have tasted.   The soup rocked and was the best thing we had.  Tasteful and flavourful unlike the meats we had.   We'll pass next time."}
{"text":"This the best Vietnamese restaurants I found in Scarborough, the food is good. Will come back definitely."}
{"text":"This place is located in a tiny run down plaza in scarborough but they serve one of the most delicious pho ever. However i dont order the pho because that would be basic. Instead,  I order this crab noodle (picture below, forgot the name) that most viet places dont serve. The noodles are thin, theres half a crab in there, and lots of egg mixed with crab roe. Dont get this if you have high cholesterol. The soup base is a tomato soup base and there are many chunks of tomato inside. The soup is full of seafood flavour and goes well with tomato. The place can get pretty crowded during lunch hours on any day so I would suggest going from 4-5. The item number is 119."}
{"text":"They have a big range of different options which is a nice change. The food was tasty and well priced. The only gripe was their service. My bowl of satay pho took an hour to show up along with some other dishes.   It ended being a 2 hour lunch which should have taken no more than an hour."}
{"text":"Enticed by the many positive reviews, we definitely had to try this place! Made it here on a weekday evening and were seated right away. We ordered the infamous crab vermicelli and were not disappointed. Lots crabby bits and yummy flavour! Also got the fresh spring roll, fried eggplant and also had com with viet sausage, pork meatballs and lemongrass porkchop. Great place to share food and very sweet and friendly staff. Definitely will revisit!"}
{"text":"The inside is small and cozy.  The food is similar in quality to other Vietnamese places I been to in Scarborough.  I did enjoy the pho along with the fresh spring rolls."}
{"text":"Best Vietname Food here. New discover : Shrimp and Crab Soup with Vermicelli. Amazing!  The portion is quite small. And always too many people waiting. Also. I waited 28mins for my meal.    Taste is unbeatable.  If you have alot of time to spend for a meal. Here pretty good!"}
{"text":"Visit is during lunch hour on a weekday. Location is in a older plaza and restaurant is cozy in size. So far, best option for Pho in the East end when I'm not willing to drive to the West. I gave it four stars for this very reason. Business appears to be family owned and operated. Menu is brief and unusual from other Pho joints. No Pho Tai Bo Vien (to my surprise). GF ordered Pho Dac Biet and she approved it. Soup was flavorful and not oily. I ordered vermicelli with spring rolls and shredded pork. It was good but there is room for improvement. Fish sauce is slightly too sour. Ratio of vermicelli to other toppings needs adjustment (too much noodles) and the dish needs bean sprouts as well as more veggies. Overall, I would still recommend this joint for anyone living in the East end."}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese food. The quality seems to vary day-to-day though. Also it's a very small restaurant usually has a line.   I"}
{"text":"This place is alright, it's nothing great and I wouldn't purposely come here to eat pho. I probably wouldn't come back again to be honest. The food isn't anything special, it's just edible. Also the place is not really clean...the waiter wiped the chair down first and used the same cloth to wipe the table after. I would much rather spend a few more dollars and go next door to Chris Jerk."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not what it use to be. I've come twice recently and each time, the pho broth was very bland, the noodles were very soggy, the bean sprouts were rotten, and the service was very slow. It's like the chef just doesn't care about the food he serves anymore. The waitresses were also not the kindest and quite slow."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap lunch/dinner. This place is run by Vietnamese people, fast sevice. Owner very nice."}
{"text":"Being Viet and residing in North York, having this place within close driving distance is a huge bonus. Most of the pho locations in North York are mainly chinese run and have that missing Vietnamese touch to their food. Got a tad East of North York and you'll find Bong Lua.   it is located in a small plaza in the corner of Huntingwood and Birchmount. It is a small joint that holds around 30-40 customers. Their menu is pretty large but not unmanageable at all.  There are two things that makes me return to this restaurant time and time again:  1) the Nem Nuong is MASSIVE. A typical rice wrap roll is about the size of a normal spring roll however at this place their rolls are literally bigger then my hands and they give you two of them. They don't even do this in Vietnam but whatever.. it's good.  2) they server Bun Rieu - a Crap Paste Noodle Soup. There are not many locations in Toronto in general that serve this dish and to find it in Scarborough is amazing. When you do find it most will serve it with fake crab meat. This place gives you the actual crab with shell.  The staff is great and friendly and they go out of the way to remember your order. I come so often that they remember my order. They are a family owned restaurant.  The food portions are large and pricing is fair.  The restaurant is fairly clean.  There will be some points where you will need to wait for your seat but they are fast to get you a table. Sometimes too quick if you are the one finishing up and others are waiting.  They close on Tuesdays so don't make the mistake of going there on their off day only to be disappointed.  Highly recommended. Although there's better, it is definitely one of the better places uptown unless you get yourself to the west end of Toronto."}
{"text":"I ordered the classic 100 and satay beef pho. They tasted great and also had good portions. The servers were attentive and responsive - extra points for that. I would like to visit this place again and try some of their other specialties!"}
{"text":"I needed to use the washroom and the let me use it without a purchase. 5/5 would use again. Food looks pretty good here"}
{"text":"Finally got to try the crab noodle after hearing positive reviews from friends. I didn't hate it, but I was less impressed.   Agree with the reviewers that described it as a mild, watered-down tomato soup. Not really sure why the tables kept getting filled..."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times......LOVE IT!!!!  However...don't go there if you are in a hurry....it's just a small family run business with usually one wait staff.  DO NOT expect to be greeted & there is no number system so stay in line & pay attention!  I have witnessed a few squabbles!! Can get entertaining LOL Come early 5-5:30 or come late around 9 or be prepared to wait. Food is FANTASTIC!! Must try the Hugh Vietnamese roll #50...the appetizer platter is a crowd fav....curry is very tasty.....Tom Yum pho is so yummy....treasure fried rice is made with tomato paste - very interesting ....of course the Pho with your choice of many toppings...I will be back to try everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I had the sweet and sour crab with dry vermicelli. It was very tasty, the crab meat is mixed in with egg but the aroma of crab is very strong. There is maybe two pieces of full crab that I just gnawed at a bit since I really didn't want to go at it like I would if I was purely eating crab. It was very flavourful.   The service was a bit slow and the food came at varying times regardless of what was ordered first. Otherwise the place served pretty good pho."}
{"text":"\"Once it hits your lips, it's so gooood!\"  That #119 sweet and sour crab noodle soup is probably one of the best noodle soups I've ever had.  Period.    I finished the noodles, sucked on a crab carcass, and drank all the broth.  Then I was sad.  I'm not even a big fan of crab.  It was really that good.  Come early or prepare to wait.  This place is small and is usually packed."}
{"text":"Great, reasonably priced Vietnamese food. Very wide variety of options. However we came near closing time so they surprisingly had run out of beef and crispy spring rolls...which was problematic as we had come craving for dishes that contained both things.  We ended up ordering a chicken and pork vermicelli bowl, pork pho, and fresh rolls). The portions were large (none of us could finish our meals in one sitting and we came hungry). The fresh rolls were a little chewier than we would have liked. Vermicelli bowl was splendid - packed with veggies, meat and flavour!  Our server was also quite nice and helpful considering they had limited options. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I came to this pho restaurant after reading the great reviews about the unique Viet dishes that Bong Lua offer. We ordered the Bun Rieu as it was the dish most highly recommended on Yelp and Pho Bo Sate.   Bun Rieu: When I saw the multiple photos of this dish on Yelp, I was anticipating this dish might be too strongly flavoured for my liking. But after tasting it, it was actually a really mild flavour, and didn't have the zing that I expected it to have. It tasted like a watered down tomato soup with some pieces of crab in it. Not to say it didn't taste good, but it was definitely not up to the hype.   Pho Bo Sate: Contrary to other satay pho's I've had in the past, this soup was much thicker than regular pho broth and tasted more like a curry soup or laksa even. I was surprised by the blend of different flavours in the soup; I tasted some tomato elements, curry, and other flavours that I never tasted in other satay pho's. Overall I really liked this satay pho as I thought it was a refreshing spin on the dish and had multiple dimensions of flavour."}
{"text":"Wow!  My new favourite pho place   Came here Sat evening around 6pm.. Pretty busy.. Luckily no line up. Had the #50 wrap with chicken - amazing. I saw that everyone had ordered one of these at their table,  so I had to try one myself. Also had the crab soup noodle - very well done,  lots of crab,  noodles were perfectly cooked,  the broth...oh so yummy... And the best part was the price.  This wonder crab noodle soup with 2 big pc of crab was under $9 - will definitely be coming back for this. . Also had their beef noodle pho - the broth was also really good!   Overall,  I really enjoyed the food here and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is severely understaffed. Service is slow because there is only one person taking orders and one person bringing out the food from the kitchen. The Pho with beef and tendon took a long time to come after it was ordered. When it did come, we discovered that the tendon was missing. The Hunan chicken and rice took even longer to arrive. Only eat at this restaurant if you have a lot of time to spare."}
{"text":"Bun Rieu #119  Get it...it's the bomb!  This spot has great value for their pho.  It's a small shop though so expect to wait if you're eating at prime time for lunch or dinner.  Maybe try it with a table for 2 if you don't want to wait.  Don't expect great service or politeness, but come here for the food and you won't be disappointed.  If anything I appreciate the directness."}
{"text":"The most authentic Vietnamese places I've been too so far in Toronto. I really liked the food. Ordered vermicelli with 3 items (spring roll, lemongrass chicken and shredded pork). This was delicious, but I'd probably try something else instead of the shredded pork next time. The wife ordered a pho. It was huge (large size)...  I ate quite a bit of it too and we still couldn't finish it. There was plenty of meat, and the broth had a nice meaty taste.   Only complaint is that the spring roll appetizer was too expensive IMO.  Takes credit card There is a parking lot, but its very busy. You may need to circle to find a place"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have tried several items from the menu.  We particularly enjoyed the steamed rolls (available on weekends only) and the freshly wrapped rice paper rolls stuffed with lettuce, basil, your choice of meat, and shrimp crackers.  What a nice crunchy surprise in taste and texture!  Very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.  Will definitely be back to this family-run restaurant."}
{"text":"My favourite pho restaurant. Their spring rolls are super big compared to any other restaurant I've been to. Pad Thai didn't disappoint at all and the pho was my fav. Hot and tasty broth and the noodles were nice and chewy. Yum! However if you are busy, don't visit them during the busy lunch/dinner times because service is a bit slow. Nonetheless, I think it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came here as a large party for a family lunch, on recommendation from my cousin. Service is slow since there's only two people working, but food is good. It's not your typical pho, so be adventurous and try some new things. The stews are good, and the shrimp rolls are well-made too. They have a really good fish soup with just the right kick as well.   We were a large party of 10, which they easily accommodated before they got busy. But once the place started picking up, service went completely downhill. We waited forever for food, and orders were missed.   I feel like I should give this place a second shot with less people, but we'll see if the opportunity arises again."}
{"text":"Amazing food but slow service. My family is partial Vietnamese so we are very picky with Vietnamese food. The chef/owner used to work at another restaurant, where my family used to visit religiously every weekend so I pretty much grew up eating her food. The bun hoi is really good (spelling?) And the rice rolls with BBQ meat is really good too."}
{"text":"I used to eat here often when i went to the highschool nearby.  The pho i would say is more of a chinese take on the  vietnamese style but delicious  netherless.  The laksa here is surprisingly good, it took awhile for the order as I would assume they dont much people ordering it."}
{"text":"One of my go-to pho places!  My favourite dishes include the Lime Beef Salad, spring rolls (nice and crispy), and grilled meat rice rolls.  Pros: - Cheaper than average pho prices  - Huge selection of Vietnamese cuisine, ranging from curry, rice, appetizers, pho, and vermicelli - Friendly service (I believe they're a family business)   Cons: - Small space; difficult to seat larger groups  - Rush hour: longer wait times  - Sometimes, their cutlery appear a little grimy"}
{"text":"If I could I would give it three and a half stars. Bun rieu (crab noodle) was delicious. Banh cuon was ok. The noodle was too thick and didn't have much flavour. Wouldn't order the vermicelli again. The service was pretty slow, but friendly. They forgot they took our order and I saw other tables get their food before ours."}
{"text":"The beast pho I've ever tried. This is a lovely family restaurant. Good food and good service"}
{"text":"I just finished eating here, I ordered raw and braised  beef Pho which is $7.95 for one portion, but at the end I've been charged for $13.50, I asked the owner is this price included tips, he answered no, just tax. So I rechecked the menu and point the price to him, he told he made mistake, I wish it's really by mistake not on purpose. So everyone go and eat this restaurant must double check your bill."}
{"text":"Food is still amazing and prices are still reasonable. 4.5/5  The one thing I noticed this time though is that they're severely understaffed. There were 3 runners last time and today, there was only 1. The lady was already overworking herself and service got sloppy.  3.5/5"}
{"text":"Came here on a mid-afternoon weekday. Order their bun rieu cua after reading the reviews. If you're a fan of crab and tomato, you'll definitely love this! Pretty strong crab taste and lots of crab meat in the mixture - surprised they have a half piece of a small whole crab in it which is a plus! Just be aware that their service is not the best. But the yummy food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Small but usually clean restaurant, pretty busy during prime time sometimes even sell out of bun rieu late in the evening around closing time.   Service is typically pretty slow especially when restaurant is busy... wait time for food varies from 10-20+ minutes after ordering (busy or not) BUT staff is friendly and otherwise efficient in other areas.   Food is good, pho and spring rolls is average nothing special but their avocado shakes and bun rieu are amazing. Avocado shake is usually made with fresh avocado and they do not use a lot of sweetener which kills the avocado flavour and ends up just tasting like a sugar smoothie. Bun Rieu is bombbb and is one of their staples; lots of pork/crab meat mixture is given as well as a piece of actual crab! Only complaint I would have about it is that it lacks depth in favour, it's not bland whatsoever but i feel like it's a little simple in-comparison to banh cuon st clair,but still the best bun rieu in the east (IMO).   Pricing is competitive possibly slightly higher for the area but quality is definitely there; making me a frequent customer"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised I haven't written a review for Bong Lua yet when this has been my go-to pho place for the longest time. Literally just came here today to grab a quick cheap bite! This place is honestly the fucking best, I really do not know how to explain my love for it.   The best thing for this place is the price and the quality. It is a cute small restaurant that seems to be run by a very lovely family. They are always so kind and assure you that you will love their food! The Viet food here always tastes like home, kinda like a secret recipe that only our grandmas would know. The food here is always fresh and never lets me down. Also, the prices is probably the cheapest I've seen for any Viet cuisine in the Scarborough area. It's amazing because their quality of the food is right on.   One thing I have noticed is that the wait times are usually a bit longer compared to other fast Viet restaurants. Honestly, the wait isn't much of a bother for me because the food never disappoints but if you're someone who is in a hurry, I would suggest going to Bong Lua a bit earlier during busy times such as lunch and dinner hours!  This is really a hidden gem! It is located in the plaza at the intersection of Birchmount and Huntingwood! Definitely check out this place, best Viet food ever, you will not regret it! Reminder: they are CLOSED Tuesday's"}
{"text":"I must admit that the food photos looked amazingly delicious.  The food itself wasn't as good as it looked but it was decent in this area.  We visited here Saturday afternoon and this place was completely filled, a good sign!    I ordered satay beef noodle: definitely not the most authentic taste but was good for what was available in the area.  The noodle portions are quite generous, a little too much for me which I would ask for reduced portions next time around.  Bun rieu was 7/10 authentic and appreciated the fact that they used thin vermicelli as traditionally used in Vietnam.  The beef brisket stew noodle my brother ordered was 5/10 it had a pungent taste of something but can't explain what it was, perhaps licorice?  One downfall during my visit was that they were so busy and under staffed.  It took forever to get our orders in and forever to receive our bill.  Numerous tables were not cleared with a long line-up of people waiting.  I would still like to revisit this restaurant in the future again to try out the other vast variety of options on the menu."}
{"text":"We came around 6pm and managed to get the last 4 seater table. People started piling in and there was a line up by 630pm! Lucky we managed to snag a table before the rush came by! The table was dirty, and I made a comment which the worker then started wiping the table. She did a thorough job but she was slow doing so...   Service was pretty slow today, only one worker (the same lady who wiped our table) and I havent seen her around before. My mom said she started about 6 months ago. She was obviously over-worked and leading to a slow service overall... people who came before us were still waiting for their food and teas. She even forgot some table's beansprouts (which they usually give before the food come) and that table had to keep asking for it.  We had to wait a bit before she popped out of the kitchen to take our orders, and for our orders to come - it took another 15 minutes. So overall the wait time today at Bong Lua was pretty long and definitely made me feel annoyed.   My mom did the right thing by just going up to the counter to pay for the bill - because who knows how long it'd be just to get the bill and then wait for them to take the bill away.    Food was splendid as usual, but I feel like they gave less noodles this time around. Less noodles, and definitely more meat! I also wish they put the chili oil on every table because I much prefer that over Sriracha :( !"}
{"text":"My uncle lured the family out to check this place out.  His daughter-in-law is Vietnamese and my mom is Chinese-Vietnamese so we are a pretty tough crowd to please.  The owners are Chinese-Vietnamese.  The restaurant itself is very tidy and clean.  The one bonus that this place gets is that they make their own rice wrappers for their dishes.  The bean sprouts, mint and limes are all very fresh.    The Pho here is pretty standard and for those of you who are anti-MSG it is pretty minimal here.  Nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"When my friend suggested Pho for our catch up lunch, I immediately thought of this place. I forget how amazingly this place stacks up to other Pho places. Large portions of noodles and toppings in a clear broth. They also have lots of specialty items that you don't normally see at other Vietnamese places, like crab vermicelli, duck and bamboo shoot noodles and their fresh rolls are amazing.   The place is quite small and gets very busy, so if you are headed for dinner, either go early or expect a bit of a wait. The service isn't greatest but the quality of the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today and managed to get sat down after 15 minutes.  There was a spare table but it wasn't cleared, from the last patrons, and there was only one waitress.  She was overwhelmed with serving everyone, clearing tables and sorting out the bills.  When we finally got seated, she gave us menus, napkins and tea.  Then she went to serve everybody else.  She returned to take our order after 15 minutes.   I felt really bad for her but my kids were less than impressed.    We ordered Special pho, tripe pho, crab vermicelli and the rolls with grilled chicken.  The crab vermicelli is really good, I would recommend it.  The rolls with grilled chicken were absolutely delicious and was lovely to eat on a hot day like today.  The Pho however, left a lot to be desired.  My kids didn't finish their small bowls.  The small size here is really small.   The soup base tasted slightly sour and was really greasy/ oily.  I wouldn't order pho from here again, it's not to our liking.   I would come back to get the crab vermicelli(#119) and grilled chicken rolls(#50) again.  I would give them both a 4* rating and the pho is a 2*.  The service is extremely lacking, even when the waitress called for help, the younger lady that came out was so miserable.  She just dissapeared after doing one thing.  Food was also really slow coming out of the kitchen, I thought my rolls were never going to turn up.  They eventually came when my kids had finished their noodles.  Need more staff in front and back. We had actually been there the previous Saturday, but their was a long queue of people.  That didn't bother me but then people started shouting and kicking off, so we left."}
{"text":"My go-to pho restaurant for the last 6 years. They have the best crab pho, (tomato soup base) definitely recommend to anyone. Also, one of the appetizers, which is a fresh rice paper roll with lemongrass chicken or pork or beef with shrimp cracker and lettuce inside, it is sooo good. Probably the best pho restaurant in the GTA. If you like Vietnamese coffee, they have really good iced ones with condensed milk, super rich and sweet similar to the coffee candy. It can be busy during dinner especially on the weekends so be prepared to wait lol or just call for take out."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but I would like to add one extra star for their wonderful service. I went at 3 pm so I have no idea what it would like be during busy times but the service I received was great; two ladies and one guy were all attentive and friendly. Keep it up gang"}
{"text":"By far the best pho broth in the East end! However, I had to wait for 45 minutes for a bowl of pho on 2 occasions! It doesn't seem like they have enough staff to accommodate the volume of traffic coming in...I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was craving a hot bowl of Pho on this rainy day, so I decided to try Bong Lua but I was quite skeptical because the previous owners which operated under a different name was quite bad.   I find it really offensive when chinese people open Vietnamese restaurants and serve unauthentic garbage food. For me, I find it disrespectful to the culture, I understand everybody is trying to make a living but at least try to have some pride in the food you serve and keep the food authentic and genuine. I just had to get that off my chest, now to the review.  I ordered a large Pho Dac Biet (Special) and an avocado shake. It was $6.50 for the large bowl which is quite reasonable, especially for how much food you get. The broth had a decent flavour but did lack some complexity. The beef was above average, the noodles were fine but the tendon was of poor quality. All in all, it's an average bowl of pho but better than quite a few of the establishments in Scarborough. The owners and cooks are Chinese/Vietnamese.   One think that really impressed me, is their menu. They offer a lot of Vietnamese dishes that are not offered in Scarborough. They had bun bo hue, bun rieu, banh hoi dac biet, banh cuon, canh chua  and a lot more. For example, 90% of the Vietnamese restaurants in Scarborough do not offer bun rieu which is a pretty common soup in Vietnam. I'm definitely going to go back to try some of the other dishes. It's quite unfortunate that they are situated in a terrible location because they definitely deserve to be busier."}
{"text":"I love the authenticity of their dishes. I've never had a bad experience at this restaurant, and I come here at least once a week.   During dinner time, there could be a bit of a wait for your food if it's busy. If you're not too hungry I think it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Small and clean place. I just had the pho noodle soup for a quick bite. It was ok... Nothing amazing. They got my order wrong, but I wasn't picky so I kept it. I didn't try anything else so don't know if the apps are good or not. The soup is suppose to be the basic staple and it was decent/ok."}
{"text":"This little family run business is hidden in a little plaza on birchmount is a hidden gem. The food is exceptionally well made and authentic.   I don't remember the actual Vietnamese names but the noodle soups 101 and so on has very good homemade broth that is not too salty, the noodles are homemade and fresh and delicious. Number 119 the crab vermicelli noodles is amazing and I haven't had any like this anywhere else! Number 50 the wraps! Omg this is a must try! The rolls are huge and delicious with a combination of meat, crunchiness and chewy wrap!   The parking lot is a problem though, it's small and it's full of cars even though most businesses are closed at night! The nearby townhouses all park here leaving no room for customers to park!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants.  It's located in a small strip plaza at birchmount and huntingwood.  It's a family owned restaurant, where the owners speak both Vietnamese and Cantonese.    Their broth is rich in flavour, and a small comes with lots of toppings.    They have a lot of unique dishes.  Number 50 on the menu is one my favs. It's rice paper wrapped in a choice of lemongrass chicken/pork/beef/vietnamese balls.  It comes with shrimp crackers, peanuts, basil, lettuce topped with fried garlic and onions.  It's a huge roll, and the crunch of the shrimp cracker really gives it a great texture.  Each order comes with 8 pieces and each piece is the size of a small fist.   They have other great noodle dishes besides beef noodle soup like duck noodle, or tomato paste crab noodles. All are very good and flavourful.    The service is very friendly and welcoming.  Majority of their clientele are returning customers as you always hear the owners saying \"great to see you again. \" or \"wow you're coming in so late.. Worked overtime?\""}
{"text":"Small restaurant, and always busy. Service is generally slow.  Plain Pho - big serving, thick noodles. Over-all delicious, nice and hot, especially perfect for a cold weather.  Beef Satay Pho - really meaty beef pieces, and tender. The broth has a good amount of peanut and heat. The broth is a bit thicker than usual.  Chicken skewer - a bit too salty but flavor is good."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to Viet place in the neighbourhood, but not after tonight. Yes, we always knew the service would be painfully slow but the food kept us coming back. Tonight, we ordered some of our usual favourites but we suspect the restaurant may now be under new management or ownership. We didn't recognize the two women working in the front (another reason why the service is so slow: they're chronically understaffed) and the signature #50 Banh Dap with Nem Nuong seriously skimped on the meat, it's now literally 1/4 of how much meat used to be in the roll. Sadly, the food no longer overcomes the slow service, so we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best hidden Vietnamese restaurants that I've tried in town. Their pho soup base tastes great and the noodles are just the right thickness. I highly recommend to try the cold wraps with choice of grilled meat, extremely tasty with nice texture from the prawn crackers and dried seasonings on top. You will leave the restaurant full and your wallet won't be that much lighter because the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm terribly disappointed that I'm dropping my rating on Bong Lua again, but this last visit was actually so ridiculous it was almost funny, if it hadn't been that appalling.  I came with two others for lunch a few Sundays ago. We were seated in the corner closest to the window, farthest away from the door. I ordered a small bun bo hue. While we were waiting for our orders, I noticed that because a number of parties of two were being seated, they were separating a number of their tables for four into smaller tables. This means that the amount of space between tables is drastically reduced. When we left the table, my brother offered to hold my bag so I could get between our table and the next. He's skinny and even he had to go between them sideways.  There were four waitresses. Only two of them understood English and Cantonese. Only one ever came to our table. Mostly, it was the two who were clueless about what we wanted. My friend asked for a plate of just limes. \"Oh. Lemons\". No. She brought out sprouts and three limes. My friend asked for more limes. Nothing. My order comes. It's wrong. They got me crab and vermicelli. No. They take my order back. She asks for limes. She finally gets limes. I finally get my order. It's spicy. I ask for 3 cups of cold water. Waitress tells other waitress. I get 3 cups. I ask that waitress for cold water. She gets me a teapot. Just in case they have a funny way of delivering cold water, I ask if it's cold. She says, \"Yes. Hot water.\" NO. COLD WATER. ARGHGHGHGGH. At this point, we basically start communicating in body language. Shivering. Cup. Water. Drink. It was ridiculous.  I never want to come back."}
{"text":"Great pho, and great springrolls. I was recommended this place by coworkers and while it looks a bit shabby from the outside, the food is to die for.   While the food was fantastic, there were a few things I found off putting. First off, even for a small, Asian restaurant, the place is dirty- on one occasion, I was sitting in a corner enclosed by the counter and the wall, and it felt so gross. Just take a look at the health inspection pass posted on the outside window- there's a dead wasp stuck between the glass and paper. Secondly, the servers always forget that I ordered a shake and I have to remind them. By the time it comes, I'd already be almost done my meal.  Food wise though, this place has really great Viet food and that can't be contested. Just wish they'd clean up the interior a bit."}
{"text":"My family friend from Vietnam actually recommended this place to me. They said the food here is really authentic. They recommended their sweet and sour crap soup vermicilli and fried spring roll. I came here at 5:45 pm on a friday evening and I was the onlh one there. The resturant is quite small. The sweet and sour crab soup was very very fishy. The crab was not fresh. They have alot of tomato in the soup but I honestly couldnt taste it. The fishy smell covered any tomato flavour. The fried spring roll was 5.50 and it came out hot and fresh. But i dont like the skin, it sticked on to your teeth. The staff was friendly, but I probably wouldnt come back. Maybe this was just a bad experience because I did hear many people recommending this place."}
{"text":"I'm used to supposed \"bad/indifferent\" service at stereotypical congee places but this didn't even cut close. This place is understaffed and hence is disorganized in so many ways.   So there were 4 of us that were in line, with 3 people behind us but seemed really keen on grabbing seats. The moment we thought it was our turn the waitress put a reserved sign on a table. I don't know if they are regulars or what not, but the waitress decided to give the open table of 4 seats to them first, til I obviously butted in and told them I was here first. Later, I noticed that right when their table sat down at the table that was previously reserved, they received their food (so they must've ordered when they were waiting in line, even though they were behind us and they allowed it? By the time we got our food, they left the restaurant.)  When we were waiting for our food, which took at least 20 minutes for simple pho, I noticed that a later pair got theirs prior to ours. We were the only table without food even though we came in first prior to 2 tables and ordered promptly.  Time came to eating. I was so distracted by the unfair service, I couldn't even enjoy my food.  First thing I noticed; no napkins or spoons. Unclean utensils (My tongue got an allergic reaction when I started using the spoon - EW what if I get Hep B because these aren't even washed properly). We approached the counter at least 4 times when no one else needed to do it.  Hire more staff during regular meal hours and weekends ffs. With such disorganization, I suggest your business be a cafeteria, not a restaurant."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch today on 21 October 2017 around 14:30 and the place was quite busy.  We did get a table.  I ordered the small Pho with Vietnamese sausage, and my husband ordered the Pho MI Dac Beit. (Pho with tender beef).   It was served quickly and was quite delicious.  We both found the noodles a bit thick, and my dish had chopped green onions but no regular onions or other vegetables that other pho places give you."}
{"text":"Ever since a friend introduced me to this restaurant called Kim Po by pacific mall, I realized there is much more to Vietnamese cuisine than just typical stuff that I know of when it comes to noodle variety.   My wife and I came here and order crab noodle soup and regular pho. What a score!!  Price point - awesome, taste awesome, speed and service - awesome!   This is a triple A mom's and pops joint and I highly recommend this place to any viet food lovers with little bit of adventurous minds.  We came back in 3 days and ordered chicken soup based noodle dish that comes with seafood and 2 different type of noodles (thick egg noodle and vermicelli), and what looked like a giant fresh rolls wth grilled pork inside.   I wanna try their beef stew and other noodle dish next time but we love this place!!  So far the best place I've found on the east end. Try it, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, their Banh Dap (a summer roll filled w/ lettuce, basil, shrimp cracker, and pork, beef, or chicken) is ginormous. However, the quality is not up to par. The rice paper was thick, rubbery, and coated in oil. The basil was non-existent and the cracker tasted bland. At least they tenderized & seasoned the pork well; so perhaps get that w/ rice or noodles instead."}
{"text":"Best vietnamese restaurant in Scarborough imo. Their wraps are so good and i love their crab & egg noodle (not sure what its called in vietnamese)."}
{"text":"Except for a little ordering error which was partially my fault I was very impressed with my dinner, it tasted great and had much more meat than most places.  I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"There's more to Vietnamese food than just pho, pho, pho, and the occasional banh mi. However it's hard to find a place in Toronto with an expansive menu. My sister came across this Scarborough strip plaza place via an Instagram post, featuring bun rieu, the crab noodle soup we grew up on. Not too often you see that in town, sadly.  The food itself was decent. The bun rieu she craves was made with a chunk of real crab, legit. I picked some sort of curry noodle bowl that had quite a spicy kick.  But man the service, slower than a 56k modem. We walked in and it didn't seem like we were noticed for a good minute, and took then just as long to serve your table. Busy and pho of diners as the place was, it took them forever to clean a table and get the next batch of diners in. From what I've read, maybe it's time this humble restaurant grease their bearings with extra staff, otherwise the next time I crave bun rieu, it'd be at my mom's dining room.  {TTC: Bus 17 or 169 to Birchmount at Huntingwood}"}
{"text":"First time here and my first impression was that this place was pretty homey.  It is a bit small in size so for larger groups be sure to have someone arrive early to reserve seats. There weren't too many servers and it didn't seem like there were too many cooks, either.   However, the quality of food definitely made up for it. I got #119, the sweet and sour crab with vermicelli noodles. The flavour was great the broth was light and with slight spiciness. I very much enjoyed the bowl and devoured the broth as well. Would definitely recommend this dish in the future. :)"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food close to home, with little next to no MSG!  Since I tried the Hot and sour soup that a Vietnamese friend introduced me to, I've always wanted for more, but I had to go all the way out to Mississauga. It's an appetizing dish with lots of vegetables. It comes with chicken, shrimp or fish. This is the only Vietnamese restaurant that carries it in the area. I've been ordering almost every time I come with friends.  I also like the menu here. You can pick any Bun (cold vermicelli noodle), rice, or pho (beef broth noodle soup) with any meat combination, and there is plenty of selection.  There is not much to say about the decor. Seating is as maximized as it can be. It's typical family restaurant, nothing fancy. I do'n't care much about the decor unless it was some kind of celebration. After all, I'm here for the food."}
{"text":"Bún Time at Bong Lua!  Winter is great for steaming bowls of beef Pho or tomato-crab Pho but what to eat when T'O starts sweltering? It's Bún Time! Dry noodles (preferably rice vermicelli) served at room temperature with 2 or 3 toppings, julienned carrots and cucumbers. Top it all off with the ubiquitous salty-tangy Nuoc mam pha sauce and you'll stay cool even when the mercury hits 40.  Today, I tried the beef wrapped in betel leaf and immediately fell in love with the aromatic flavours. My other Bún topping choice, the traditional lemon grass chicken, was succulent and satisfying.  Some other dishes that I'll be eating this summer include the ever-popular giant roll with lemon grass pork and prawn crackers (#50) AND the crispy rice flour/mung bean crepe (Banh Xeo #54)."}
{"text":"This place is really quite the hidden gem in Scarborough! Really good Viet food and service is great as well! I would get here earlier though cause there's always a nice big dinner crowd :) the restaurant is a small place so it doesn't hold that many people, but service is fast so it's okay.   This time we ordered the sweet and sour crab noodle soup number 119 and the grilled pork and lettuce wrap number 50. It was really really good! :) I like that they don't over salt their food and they use real crab in their crab noodle soups instead of fake canned crab.   I'd come back for sure :)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Scarborough.  It's a small place with a formidable line at peak times to attest to its growing popularity.    The Bun Rieu is good, but my usual order is the vermicelli with lemongrass chicken and egg loaf (mmm egg loaf...).  Juicy chicken, spongey, perfectly seasoned egg loaf, crunchy pickled vegetables and springy vermicelli make a very satisfying Friday night meal.   The #50 roll is filled and topped with yummy bits and is great for sharing.  Don't confuse it with the appetizer spring rolls which don't have a lot going on.    Did I mention the egg loaf is good?"}
{"text":"The goat curry rice is BOMB OMG so good!!! Not spicy.  It's a coconut curry.  Even my grandparents loved it!!!"}
{"text":"yes, it is sometimes understaffed but the food is absolutely amazing!  i know when the food is good when i come home and i don't have to drink 2 gallons of water to quench my MSG induced thirst!!!!!!   i drank the whole bowl of pho soup and i felt fine afterwards when i came back home.  i have had only the pho noodles and the rice rolls with pork inside it and both were very yummy!!!  the sauce was perfect but one thing i did not like which is not a huge deal but i still have to mention this  was the the bean sprouts that comes the pho was already cooked/boiled.  this is mistake.  the cooking of the sprouts changes the texture and the taste of the sprouts.    all you millennials have fancy smart phones, right?  go on them while you wait for the food!  it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight, when it didn't seem as busy, cause I've been by before but was turned off by the wait.  Ordered the Bún Riêu (Tomato and Crab noodle) after looking at the reviews and pictures. It comes out pretty quick with the regular pho toppings of bean sprouts and herbs on the side.  The taste is a bit on the mild side. It is a light tomato soup but you can still taste the crab. I liked the egg that was mixed in and overall the flavour was nice. There is also a small crab in there which while yummy to suck on, isn't worth picking apart for the meat.  Also had the Iced Vietnamese Coffee, which was pretty good."}
{"text":"I came here specifically to have the crab egg soup. Typically most Vietnamese restaurants don't offer this dish so I was happy to see it here on Yelp. My mother in law makes this dish often however it's usually made in huge batches, so it was nice just to drop by and be able to have a small bowl. The broth was very flavourful and I like how they have the pieces of crab shell there too with the egg roe. Overall I would definitely come back for this dish and it is currently the only place I know that serves it in Toronto!"}
{"text":"My favorite pho place in Toronto.  The duck leg pho and the 'pretty girl' pho is always a hit with the family.  It's pretty much what we always crave when we want a hot bowl of soup and noodles.  Best thing is that you don't get thirsty afterwards from drinking the soup!"}
{"text":"Food is very average. Nothing out of the ordinary. Portions to price is more than fair.  Horrible service. Expect ridiculous wait time. Only because of this reason, I'd never go back. Need to hire people that know how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"Food countines to be great. Tried the crab vermecelli. It's delicious! Where else can you get actual crab soup and noodles for under 8 bucks? It's extremely tasty and flavourful!"}
{"text":"Bong Lua Vietnamese Restaurant is by far one of my favourite places to go.  It has a huge selection of Vietnamese cuisine ranging from curry to vermicelli. As well, I love the fact that it always has fresh ingredients for all their dishes. Also the prices are generally cheaper compared to the average Vietnamese Restaurant. However during rush hour, there will definitely be a line due to the limited space. But the service is always great and the environment is really cozy and comfy."}
{"text":"Was quite impressed with the overall prices of everything. I've found that a lot of the pho places I go to have increased prices a lot. I ordered the Bun Rieu and enjoyed the flavor of the broth. It came with a piece of crab with the shell which definitely helped with the presentation. Would come back!"}
{"text":"THE WORST PHO PLACE EVER! The broth was alright, but the beef was TERRIBLE!! Super thick cuts , so thick it was even hard to chew. And at the very end of my meal I found a little fly in my broth..... Will never come back again.  Update: Changed from 1 to 2 stars. They gave me a new soup noodle to go even though I said it was okay. Great service, but still won't come back lol ."}
{"text":"After a good 20+ min wait to be seated for a quick lunch on a Sunday afternoon, I was grossed out right away to see the server wipe down our table with a dirty towel (yes, a towel. like the hand tower you would use at home) as we sat down to haphazardly push the remnants of the previous diners spills onto the floor.  The restaurant was crowded and the servers seem so flustered, busying around taking orders, cleaning and cashing people out.  Totally disorganized.  We waited another 10+ min to order our food and 20+ min more to get our food.  We ordered a large house Pho and a satay beef pho.  First off, their condiment bottles were just disgusting with caked on spill overs of sriracha and hoisin.  Our chopstick basket sat empty and we had to ask them to bring us some chopsticks.    My husband's house pho was ok.  Decent size bowl of noodles with different meats and meatballs.  The broth tasted fairly standard and nothing to write home about.  My satay beef pho was the most curious looking thing ever since my encounter with just as odd bowl of satay beef pho at Pho Mono in Ajax.  The broth was thick and it was a yellow curry base.  Out of my surprise, I asked the lady who brought the food and she simply said, \"yeah, satay beef.\"   The satay beef pho was over-cooked noodles bathing in a thick (thickened with cornstarch) in a yellow curry soup base.  My years of Pho eating experience failed to prep me for this encounter but since we had already spent too much time waiting to be seated and getting the food, I decided to just eat it so we could leave.    Over all, the flavour of the satay pho wasn't bad.  It was just not the satay beef pho I wanted.  Would I be back to Bong Lua?  Not in a million  years."}
{"text":"Overall everything I ate here was on par with other pho joints. Only complaint is that the noodles were over cooked so they were a bit on the soggy side. Good portions of noodles and meat.   The deep fried spring rolls were amazing and extra crispy.  The coconut slushie and durian slushie were made fresh and had actual flavors of the fruit.   3.5 stars"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! If you like crab you must try their crab soup noodle, #119 (i think). And their #50 is delicious! I'm always craving this place and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Shut up and listen!  Do you like spicy beef satay?  Do you like pho? Then come here and get the beef satay. It comes in a hybrid pho form with plenty of sauce and nuts. Words cannot describe how disgustingly good this stuff is. If I could boil it down and inject it into my veins, I would.   Don't read the menu. It's a waste of time just order the spicy beef satay."}
{"text":"A small restaurant with limited seating especially when a reservation took up 15 seats. Waited 20 minutes for a table of 3.   Ordered the following:  * Large Pho with Rare Beef (7.50$) - Fresh and delicious, beef was not fatty and had good flavour. Never received the usual bean sprouts on the side though.  * Bun Vermicelli with Grilled Lemongrass Chicken and Pork Balls (7.50$) - Fresh vegetables, meat had excellent flavours but I was disappointed in the sauce. It lacked flavour and tasted watered down unfortunately.  * Spring Rolls (4.95$) - Average but nothing outstanding.   Overall food and service was 3 stars at most. Service was OK when taking out order but they looked overwhelmed from the party of 15. It looked a bit unorganized to be honest. I might come back and give it another try when it's not as busy."}
{"text":"Definitely one of our/my favourite restaurants in the area. We usually hit this place up Sunday afternoons so that it servers as our lunch and dinner. The top three items for my family are usually pho, #50 spring roll with lemongrass bbq pork, fried chicken wings. They do takeout so sometimes we swing by to pick an order up and enjoy it at home."}
{"text":"Good food Below average service, I think operate like this daily...but once you get your food, you're set to go.  For some reason ordering drinks takes a while - almost half way done the meal then the drink comes, and it's just mixing ingredients... Most of the items on the menu are below $10"}
{"text":"Came here for their snow crab noodle dish. Was disappointed the third time can't here. Not as much snow crab in the dish anymore. Plus I always feel the owner, or head chef, doesn't really like business. I had called ahead of time before to say that we are coming less than an hour before closing but they wouldn't let us come."}
{"text":"Came at 1 on a Sunday. Waited not long to get a table. Ordered 2 bowls of noodles and one rice roll. 102 the Tom yum pho, way too sour. I came with the bf so after we shared that bowl of Tom yum we continued to wait over 20 mins for our 2nd bowl of crab soup pho. Now if you ever been to Kim bo across pmall the bowl at bong lua is the worst tasting pho I've ever had. Another 15 mins later they brought our spring roll in a to go box saying they mixed up. I mean if this tasted good the wait would be tolerable. But the food tasted terrible and service was terrible I would definitely not come back.  1 stars for food 2 stars decor 1 star service"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  This is definitely one of the more underrated Vietnamese restaurants in Scarborough. All the talk is about Kim Po, and while I still prefer the Scarborough Kim Po for my viet fusion dining, this is definitely an excellent substitute if I'm in the area.  I had the 119, which was the crab meat thick noodle soup. The two other restaurants I know that also serve this are Kim Po (Scarborough) and Forget Me Not Cafe in North York. I personally think it's on par with Kim Po (all dependent on if you like the udon thick or thin...this place has the thinner kind), and that in alone is considered excellent considering my positive review for that restaurant. They add some black pepper and dried crispy things that actually go along quite well with the noodle soup. My only complaint would be the crab pieces they put in the soup, there's no meat in there...so it's more of a distraction than a part of the bowl.  Service is surprisingly decent. I don't think much of it since it's a Vietnamese restaurant and you normally come for the food, but they do say thank you here at least.  If you like your traditional pho, this is not your place. If you like your fusion style Vietnamese food (aka bun bo hue, crab meat noodle soup, beef brisket noodle in tomato soup), this is an excellent option."}
{"text":"Friend brought me here the other day and man wish I knew about this place before! Great pho and side dishes! Located in a small plaza off Birchmount, finding parking was a challenge for us coming in for dinner on a Friday evening. There are quite a few restaurants in the plaza. The restaurant itself is fairly old and seating was a bit uncomfortable but the food was excellent! We ordered the the special pho and I found the soup flavourful and the meat particularly fresh. We also ordered a beef roll wrapped in some sort of leaf (forget the name) which was tasty. Apparently the item #50 is the crowd favorite so will visit again to try it. There was a bit of a wait because service isn't the quickest and it's a small restaurant (worth it though!)   I'd visit again!"}
{"text":"Bun reiu was 6/10 bland. Pho 5.5/10 Spring rolls were tiny and not crunchy.   Fish sauce was weak AF Price is pretty good if u want food on the cheap"}
{"text":"This place is excellent for its authenticity (according to my husband as he's got Vietnamese roots) and the servers are very nice to us. The place can be slightly cleaner but they are not filthy either. It's one of those hole in the wall places and we will always go back for more pho and vermicelli dishes."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes to be given a dirty table to sit at, then another 15 just to get our order taken. When the noodles finally came we asked for spoons, which they didn't have at any of the nearby tables or napkins. We had to wait another good few minutes to get our spoons and then the waitress came and took them back because another table needed more than us apparently. We also asked for bowls and they weren't washed very clean, still had small bits of food on it. The soup is almost all msg, an hour later you'll have really dry mouth. The experience was awful, the food mediocre at best, and the service was horrid. Would not recommend, would stick to bamburgh circles pho"}
{"text":"Located in an old Scarborough plaza Bong Lua is located alongside some other Foodie favourites such as Chris Jerk and Mexico Lindo.  Kids felt for Vietnamese last night so decided to try this place out for the crab tomato soup #119 everyone was talking about.  Have to say it was very good even though I really don't like eating blue crab as its a pain in the arse to eat:)   The #50 roll is outstanding though as we ordered the beef version.  The rice paper wrapped around the veggies and beef with the crispy tofu gave a great contrasts in flavour and texture.  The Pho were all very good and flavourful.  The rice dishes however were pretty weak and the fried spring rolls were lacking.  The portions are very large and the price is very reasonable for what you get.  With only two people working the front it can be hard to flag them down when it gets busy but they are working hard so have to give them an A for effort.    Overall a good place to grab some Vietnamese food in the area."}
{"text":"Went here last night because of the yelp reviews. Have come to this plaza regularly for Mexico Lindo which I love, and also Hunter's pizza. Never thought to try this Vietnamese place till I read the great reviews. The place was packed when we arrived but luckily there was a table open for us. As others have commented there are only 2 servers essentially but they give you a pot of tea (thermos) so you don't have to keep fishing a server down for tea. Servers were friendlier than you might expect. There's a TV playing cp24. We order the Nem Nuong wrap to start -with grilled beef. Came out in a timely manner. And as others have shown it was huge. Very tasty with the nuoc mam / fish sauce. The fried onions on top were a nice addition and the peanuts and shrimp crackers inside made it perfect. This would be a great summertime lunch. My main was my favorite- Banh Xeo / Vietnamese \"omelette or pancake\". I've had it elsewhere, often at Pho Vietnam, but this was exceptional. My new favorite for my favorite! It was wonderfully crisp. No mushrooms like at PV which is so much better (I don't think they belong in this dish). And seemed to have more mung bean which was really nice. Kind of wish they included mint with the lettuce that comes with it but the deliciousness if the banh xeo outweighed this omission. Ask the flavors were balanced just as I wanted. Hubby wanted the goat curry but they didn't have any goat. So he had the chicken curry with rice instead. I tried just the curry sauce and it was very nice. Kind of homey. They did totally forget his order though until we asked about it. I was almost half done my banh xeo. We also ordered the jackfruit with jelly drink. It was OK but the ice chunks were annoying. It should have been more crushed. A bit too much syrup even for my companion's sweet tooth. The fruit comes in chunks to, not blended. Probably wouldn't order this one again. We wanted the sour sop shake but they didn't have any sour sop. Overall I was impressed and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Mediocre service man, so disappointed. Waited about half an hour to get seated and another 20 minutes to get our order taken. We were even thinking about leaving but we're at the point where we've already committed at eating here... Other than that the food was great but I wouldn't come back if the service continues like this!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 5. I've come here almost once a week as a kid and I still do now. Me, my korean friend and African American friend always buy the big rice wraps with pork (Halal Pork) and veggies inside. It's the most amazing thing I've ever eaten.  I haven't had anything else from the menu, but my Korean friend says he's never had a bad dish from there. If you haven't tried this amazing wrap then you should go Now. It's kind of like meth, you try it once and you're hooked. The only difference is that it's cheaper (Around $7)."}
{"text":"Came here based on recommendations from my coworkers as they said this place has really good Pho and I agree!  Visited here around 1:30pm on a Sunday and they were packed. Mind you, this restaurant is very small to start with, but there were at least 10 people waiting for tables when I got here. People were seated quickly and service was moving at a decent pace. This is a small family run business and you can see each person working their hardest to serve everyone.  I tried their House Special Beef Noodle Pho and Deep Fried Spring Rolls.  The soup for the pho was flavorful and not overly salty. Beef was served slightly raw so you could have it cook in the soup. Overall a pretty good bowl of Pho.  The spring rolls was the highlight for me. They were extremely crispy but also really easy to bite into. Probably one of the best crispy spring rolls I've had at a Pho restaurant.  Glad I gave this place a try and would come back again!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and lots of variety. It can get quite busy here especially with the number of take out orders.    Service is painstakingly slow though. Often they only have one person serving, cleaning, taking the bills and taking orders back to the kitchen. It can get overwhelming very quickly. I haven't been back since I actually got up and left after waiting over an hour for my food - repeatedly asked the server for the status and kept being assured it was coming next... more than an hour was just too ridiculous for a bowl of pho..."}
{"text":"3. 5*Mediocre is how I would describe the  curry I ordered. Under the influence of the waitress I decided to order this curry. I patiently waited for this so called amazing curry and finally it arrived to my table.  First bite didn't quite capture my attention. It tasted salty with a bit of sweetness in the after taste. Don't get me wrong this curry is not bad at all, it just doesn't deserve being called good curry. ( Maybe I'm just picky because I'm on the journey to find the best curry). The coconut flavour and spiciness was lacking in this dish. Chicken was fairly tender and vegetables were crunchy and tasty.  Curry to Rice ratio was perfect as I finished both at the same time. This is an alright curry it'll pass as comfort food but definitely not a pleasant dish.  Ranking system: ?: 3/5 (dish appearance) ?: 2/5 (dish scent) ?: 3/5 (dish taste)  PS. Service was slow but polite."}
{"text":"Understaffed. Had to wait more than five minutes when there were three tables empty of patrons but occupied by piles of dishes. And there weren't that many tables to start off with in the cramped space. Forgot to provide basil and bean sprouts. When they did come, the sprouts were blanched...don't know why. The dish I asked for had tendon on the menu, but it didn't actually come with any. The soup was nondescript at best. The coffee came after I finished the noodles. Won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic with some menu choices that you normally don't see. The sizes to price ratio is pretty good and the food isn't full of oil, MSG or salt. Love their rice paper rolls and crab with noodles in soup (quite alot of crab meat and the soup has a good complex flavour)."}
{"text":"One of the great Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto - this place is quite small though, mind you. Service is always great and it seems like it's a family business. They are super helpful when it comes to what is the most recommended and what are the people's favorite item on the menu. I had a couple great experiences and never disappointed.   I got the big Spring roll every single time. I can't even tell you how big they are... Can't really fit it all in my mouth. It tastes amazing because they put a lot of different ingredients in there that make it tasty. This is one of the reasons why the people have recommended it and loved it.  My second favorite item is the crab shell and crab paste noodle. So flavorful - not the too salty type and not the msg type either. You know they use real ingredients and really cute crab !! So good! Definitely recommended !!!!!    I say come try it and you might be surprised by this teeny tiny restaurant. It has a lot to offer!"}
{"text":"Their pho broth is awesome - you pick up more than the 1-dimension beef flavor at the majority of other Vietnamese restaurants. You taste a wonderful myriad of spice notes with every scoop. The deep fried spring rolls were deliciously hefty and golden - 2 were adequate to satisfy me and 1 other person. Together the food quality and the menu get a 4/5.  The service is slow... there was too much going on at once that our table's order was taken over 4 minutes of having our arm raised. One server was in and out of the kitchen frantically, the other was drying chop sticks while the seating area was full house with a line to the door. We also noticed some of the bowls and cutlery weren't washed or dried properly, oily, or specked with unknown substance. Restaurant experience gets a 2.5/5."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the place was filthy. What do you expect?   But I don't want to feel that I might get food poisoning just by looking at the left over food that fell onto the seat or the half-a$$ed wiping of the table.  I had the Bun Rieu (crab flavoured vermicelli with tomato) and it was actually quite good. The pho with meat balls was also decent. The service is ok. One of the owner's daughters looks like she hates working there. Overall, a 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I visited this place the other day, and WOW! Do I ever love this place...   It's a small little restaurant, hidden gem! I got the feeling that it's a family business when I went in, kind of felt like home.  Don't expect a fancy place when you come.  The food here is absolutely phenomenal! My favourite Vietnamese place by far.  My friend ordered her favourite crab noodle in soup, she's a regular.  And I got  the typical rare beef noodle in soup.  I tried her crab noodle and definitely could not stop thinking about going back again and again and again.  They use real crab even with the shell inside the soup, and the soup base is not watery at all. Well made!!  The coconut shake the server recommended was soooo good! She asked if I wanted the ice version or the coconut juice version, but she said the ice is her favourite so I gave it a shot.  She was damn right! I couldn't stop drinking it even though I got a brain freeze, it was that good!    I rarely ever feel THIS hyped up, but they've definitely won my heart.  And I'm dying to go back on a weekend try their rice noodle #53 that's only served on weekends! Can't wait to try more stuff here!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended here. Though she strongly suggests crab and egg noodle I still ordered the tomato and beef frank noodle. The taste is good, I wouldn't say excellent. I think I'm gonna try the recommended one next time. :)"}
{"text":"You have to love it when the cook is also your server, and cashier. This is a mom and pop Pho shop that offers msg free meals, great spring rolls and of course, Pho :) Although the shop is small and basic, its all about the food and Bong Lua delivers on taste, freshness, and service. If you are in this area and have a craving for Pho, this is definitely a go to place :)"}
{"text":"So much more than pho!   Located in a pretty old Scarborough plaza, right in the middle of a neighborhood, you're sure to have passed by this place before if you hang around this part of town. This place isnt big, but theres lineups almost all the time, and you know something is good when that happens. If you come during lunch or dinner on weekends, or even week days, be prepared to wait a bit at least.  Popular dishes here include their rolls, which are literally double (if not triple) the size or your usual ones, and their tomato crab noodle soup. Its just a tad salty but also very flavourful; its also very generous in portion. Tip: the server told us that a lot of people get this dish confused with another soup on their menu, so be sure to ask them if its your first visit. And of course, you need a shake to finish off a pho meal. Personal fave (and I get it every time I come here) their durian or coconut shake. So creamy and refreshing.   Service isnt the fastest imo but servers are very friendly. Sometimes it takes more than 15-20 min for something to come, so in the mean time ordering a drink first may be a good choice."}
{"text":"There were 2 servers and it took 10 mins until a gentleman came out of the kitchen and acknowledged me. The servers didn't even glance or give me a nod to at least let me know I'll be seated soon. Also, there were still dirty dishes on tables that weren't occupied, which can be unpleasant to look at if you're eating and sitting next to one.   I ordered the crab vermicelli soup that everyone raves about but personally didn't think it was anything special."}
{"text":"I loved the ambience here.   I expected the waitresses to be grumpy old Chinese ladies but they were first-class.    However, I won't go back for the pho.  It was only average and the other dishes looked 10x better on Yelp. & don't get the spring rolls - overpriced and tasted slightly odd.   Will be coming back to try other things."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've been to so far! My favourite was the bun rieu (crab meat noodle soup). Delicious!! Definitely must try this!   The place is small, decent and clean. To avoid the long queue, come before lunch hours or reserve the table before coming in."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner with my boyfriend.  Tried the Bun Rieu Cua Vietnamese Crab Noodle Soup ($8.95 for a small) and it was really good!! Essentially, it's a crab and tomato soup. Lots of minced crab bits in the soup, even the small bowl had half of the crab inside. The soup is really flavorful, sweet and sour with a strong crabby taste. You'll love this if you like to eat crab tomalley because the soup base is full of tomalley flavor. Really tasty. Would come back for this - a must try when you come here!  Their other food items here were ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"Pretty ok. Recently opened, Chinese owned but food is pretty good. Inside restaurant is small and there is always a wait - which usually means good but a little bit annoying, very few tables and tight spaces. we like the pho there, curry, bun Rieu, banh hoi. We don't go there anymore bc wait is long and space is tight and oh yeah, food takes soooo long to come out."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the Scarborough area and also one of the better Vietnamese restaurants around.  Be sure to order the Crab Vermicelli. It is so delicious! And did I mention the portion is huge?  Another dish that was really well done was the vermicelli with 3 items. Their meat ball is bomb!  Spring roll is a little small, but tasted great.  No complaints here!  Friendly staff, delicious food, big portions, what more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"A friend wanted to be try this place out. I had a bowl of braised beef in carrot soup. And some chicken rice wraps.  I'm not a huge fan of rice wraps in general. So don't let my bias on this dish away you from anything. The skin itself was actually not bad, that's usually one of the main parts of the wrap that I don't like. Inside, there are some veggies, crushed shrimp crackers which was new for me, the chicken, and some crushed peanuts. Everything was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of the crushed peanuts. That's probably the second main reason why I generally don't like rice wraps. But if you like those 2 things you would likely enjoy it.  Onto my noodles. This is usually one of my go to items at pho restaurants. Usually had a nice flavourful broth to go along with the braised beef and carrots. It looks spicy due to the redness of the broth, but isn't at all. My noodles are gonna be the \"ho fun\" or rice noodle. And I haven't been to a place that sucks at making that yet. Braised beef will get stuck in between your teeth though."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekend with a friend. Forgetting that one should never discriminate size for greatness, this Hole-in-the-Wall noodle restaurant serves a great bowl of pho (I just ordered the special) and I was truly surprised to get such high quality in such a small place.  I'm not a broth drinker so I have no expertise on that taste, but I definitely prefer my pho to be a bit al dente, which is tough to find since many viet restaurants shirk on noodle quality by using cheaper rice noodles that cook and mush by the time it's served at the table. Here, the noodles alone were tip-top (though I probably think it's slightly the next best thing to Pho 88 in Bamburgh Circle).  Be prepared to wait 15-20min for a table on a weekend, but it's worth it. And like most pho restaurants I've encountered in GTA, the ventilation is not strong enough to disperse the scent of pho noodles which people either really love or cannot stand at all."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and got to choose my table.  I ordered a Pho Tai.  The noodles were very soft, and seemed ?overcooked?. The broth was tasteless. The meat was soft, but a good texture I think. I actually wouldn't mind the noodle part if the broth had more taste.  The place isn't dressed up, but is a cozy place for something casual."}
{"text":"The food here has never been a problem for me. In fact that's why I keep coming back. And that's probably why there's always a lineup to get in. I only order pho here, so I can't really comment on the other dishes though.  My problem is that service has gone downhill lately. On my latest visit we didn't have any spoons at our table. The tables around didn't have any either for us to steal from. When we finally got some there was a bean sprout stuck to one of them! The two waitresses seem stressed with the workload and they could probably use another. The kitchen is getting noticeably slower too, with some specialty soups (like the beef and carrot stew) taking a lot longer than regular pho. So you end up with a situation where half your table is almost done when your dish arrives.  But service can easily be remedied (they're trying to hire more staff). Each time I give them the benefit of the doubt and try them again. And one day I'll finally be able to give them an extra star or two."}
{"text":"First Taste of Vietnamese http://www.yelp.ca/biz/taste-of-vietnam-toronto, then Pho 33 http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pho-33-vietnamese-restaurant-scarborough and now Bong Lua...  A different owner, a new coat of paint and another new Vietnamese restaurant!  Special House Pho Large ($6.50) is huge... I wish I ordered the small. Enjoyed how the raw beef is really raw... but the broth is not hot enough. I found the broth a little bland and lack any complexity.  A family owned restaurant so it does have a really friendly vibe....  I might come back to try other item on the menu..."}
{"text":"Their bun rieu is the best I've had in the gta! The tomato soup is flavourful and they give you heaps of crab meat/stuffing (not sure what to call it) and large pieces of tomato. Also comes with pieces of actual crab in the shell though I can't manoeuvre it to get any meat out. This is the perfect meal on a chilly day. Their bun bo hue is flavourful and pretty spicy. I would recommend both noodle soups :)  -1 star for the service, which is basically non-existent. They are super understaffed for how busy they are. When I got there, I had to wait for a table for ~10 minutes even though there were at least 3 vacant tables (just not cleared or wiped yet). I was not even acknowledged once after being seated and had to ask for the menu and water multiple times. Actually not even sure if they forgot or just didn't hear me or understand me every time I ask for something. Server gave us another table's drink order and was confused when we said it's not ours.  Bean sprouts on the side that comes with the soup is cooked.. which I thought was weird because it's not usually cooked at other pho places.   Conclusion: service is very bad, but food is good"}
{"text":"Pretty good Vietnamese food for Scarborough, but service is extremely slow. You need to ask them for everything, food takes a little long to come and utensils are never really fully stocked."}
{"text":"I am updating my review based on recent visit. I don't expect much service at a place like this; just bring me my food in a timely manner, that's all I ask for.  My recent service, service was extremely slow.  I ordered noodle soup which is nothing fancy, it should it served quickly.  My husband got his steamed rolls order and almost finished eating it and I still didn't get my noodle soup. Steamed rolls were just ok and very small portion for the price; I don't recommend it.  Bun bo hue was good, decent portion for a small; broth was flavourful, not a lot of meat in my noodles though.  Deep fried chicken wings were just ok; kinda disappointed. I was expecting fish sauce chicken wings at some viet restaurants but it wasn't quite that; a bit bland IMO. It did come with a sauce and I did need the sauce to enhance flavour.  I had other viet wings at other places; it was so flavourful u wouldn't need to dip in sauce."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and got the following:  sweet and sour crab with vermicelli (#119) - pretty good broth and I liked that they added real crab in the soup noodle  large fresh spring roll with pork (#50) - yum this was actually better than the crab vermicelli and comes with a dip  I liked the fact they had servers that spoke English unlike other places. I didn't like that the other patrons had loud screaming kids (which made the dining experience less enjoyable), and lack of table space.   Food is very tasty and surpassed my expectations. Will def be back to try other items from the menu specifically the fried rice and the dry vermicelli."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  This Vietnamese restaurant is my go-to in Scarborough.  The service is okay but what I really enjoy is the Bun Rieu - it's so flavourful and comforting, especially on a cold day.  If you're a fan of tomato and crab, you'll love this!  However, I have not ordered anything else except the spring rolls, which are pretty good.  I've sampled many eating partners' dishes - the pho is okay and the vermicelli is pretty good.  Yesterday, one of my eating partners had the Vermicelli with lemongrass chicken and spring roll.  You can build your Vermicelli bowl by having two topping selections, which I found pretty awesome.  Note: This restaurant is a popular one, so make sure you come early for dinner on the weekend.  I went yesterday at 8pm and still had to wait!"}
{"text":"This pho place was tucked away at a corner plaza beside a jerk chicken. I must say I love their fresh assortment of lettuce and vegetable pairings. The pho is nice and hot with a big portion of meat.   The appetizer was my least favourite part as we ordered the wrong one. I do wish to go back and try the crispy one in the fresh roll wrapping.   Overall a great price for the food we got! We would definitely come back! There was a line up when we left so they must be popular with the locals."}
{"text":"been coming here for years, but never tried their Bun Rieu which i heard was really good here.    it was a full house and it looked like the staff could not handle it.   i can see people were getting upset as orders were getting mixed up.    They originally told me Bun Rieu is sold out... i was thinking in my head how can they sell out? its like 6:30-7pm... So i started looking at the menu for something else .. luckily the staff came back out and said they suddenly have it again.  in whatever case i re-ordered it... it was pretty good.  it did have small sections of blue crab in it.  Its a good change from the typical pho served here.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"TLDR: really busy on weekends - best to go before 12! Large bowl of noodles for under $10! Slow service, very little attention.    Yummy Pho Dac Biet! This is my family's go to Vietnamese cuisine. If you go on the weekend, expect a longer wait time (15-30mins). I don't believe you can make reservations, first come first serve.  The food here is great! You really get the bang for your buck. We normally order the Pho Dac Biet, it comes with an abundant amount of beef! I have also tried their Bun Bo Hue, Banh Canh Cua, and Hu Tieu Nam Vang at other times. It's okay, but not as good as their Phos, I also don't recommend the Hu Tieu Nam Vang, which is a rice noodle soup with BBQ pork, Vietnamese sausages, fish balls - it was okay, but not as good as other places. Their Bun Bo Hue and Banh Canh Cua were good, but could be better!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends and immediately got a table, even though it was packed out. Ordered Bun Bo Hue (my favourite), Hu Tieu Nam Vang, and Bun Rieu (their specialty). The service was nice but it took way too long to get our food. Pretty close to an hour wait, which is not normal for a vietnamese restaurant (which I am familiar with, being a vietnamese in North York). I'll definitely take the \"hiring\" sign to heart next time. They were missing quite a few ingredients for their dishes, their Hu Tieu was bland, and their Bun Bo Hue noodles were kind of tough. Their Bun Rieu is the only thing I would give a thumbs up on amongst the dishes purchased today."}
