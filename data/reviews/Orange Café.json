{"text":"I honestly wasn't expecting much from this place. There was nothing about the interior that made me beam and when a menu has about a trillion things on it, you know that everything might be mediocre at best since they don't really specialize in anything. 

I ordered \"The Pacific\" omelette with smoked salmon. Omelette entries come with potatoes, toast and coffee. Service was quick, though we came on weekday morning. Holy. Huge. How many eggs did it take to make the omelette? I don't even want to know. My omelette was quite good but near the end I started to get bored (partially my own fault because I kept eating it after I was already quite full). I wondered what else could be in the omelette...is that something I should even be asking..? I could be wrong but the omelette definitely tasted like it had some sort of filler which I think is why it was so big. Is this standard practice in restaurants? 

Next, let's talk about coffee. Well, there's nothing to really talk about. Diner style refillable, weak coffee. But you know what? I didn't even mind because crappy coffee fit pretty well with the overall ambiance. 

I wouldn't mind coming back for brunch if someone wanted to go. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a place I'd bring someone to."}
{"text":"I came alone and asked to sit at a table rather than at the bar so that I could do some work. The host said this wasn't a place to do work since it was constantly busy, so I said I wouldn't occupy the table for more than a usual meal, like an hour? He replied half an hour. Even though I think that half an hour isn't really an accurate assessment for ordering and eating a meal, I said that was fine. I was told I would have to wait, so I asked if he could put my name on a list while I sat outside in the meantime. After 20 minutes of watching people leave and others be seated, I was approached by a waitress who told me that her boss had sent her with a message for me that \"nothing was opening up inside\" and that she could take my order outside. I asked if that meant that he didn't want to seat me inside, and she said no and repeated her message. I was upset but said that was fine and asked for a menu. When it started to rain, I went inside and saw that the host had seated 2 people who had come long after me at a table for 2 and then another 2 people who had just arrived at a table for 4. Clearly, he wasn't going to seat me inside, so I left, and I don't intend to go back. I understand that serving 1 person usually means less money than serving 2 people, but I've never been treated this way at a restaurant for going in alone."}
{"text":"I ordered a margarita pizza to go and this is how it was presented . It doesn't have tomato sauce and the taste is horrible. It's not
Cooked very well I am deeply disappointed"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Loved the avocado with eggs Benedict! Had a bite of crepe- yum! Nice service, great coffee and orange juice. Too full to try smoothie but I'll be back"}
{"text":"Our first time at Orange Cafe was a pleasant experience. The owner was very welcoming and made sure we had a great first time experience. The menu has a big selection to choose from. We were recommended to try the eggs benedict and it did not disappoint. We will definitely go back to try out their lunch menu! Good brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Nothing super special, but they do standard breakfast stuff pretty well. The service is so-so: sometimes really friendly and helpful and other times really slow and a bit rude. But overall a good place to meet for breakfast. The restaurant is pretty big, so you're likely to find a spot even on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"Such a weird breakfast. I ordered an eggs Benny orange, which had cold hard boiled eggs sliced up, with bacon bits and onions and mushrooms on French bread with an odd milky sauce. This is NOT how eggs Benedict is made. Next time I will stick to my usual st viateur bagel cafe, the quality is much better. Meh."}
{"text":"Okay, nothing special for the price you pay. Dishes are around $15 but do include coffee and refills. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"For me, one of the best breakfasts in Montreal. Lots of choices for every taste, generally good quality, and despite the business on the weekends, I've never had a big problem with the service. Also, lots of vegetarian options (but probably not much for vegans).

I recommend the Pacifico omelet. Delicious! My wife always gets the Hellenic omelet, and it's also very good.

This place swipes Cora's under the rug, no problem. Never been for lunch or dinner, so can't recommend in that regard."}
{"text":"This is my go-to breakfast place.  They know how to make good standard breakfast fare.  Their eggs are always cooked to perfection.  Some staple items for me are the \"Two and two\" and the bagel lox.  One thing I do find disappointing is their hollandaise sauce; it doesn't taste very good.   They also have great service.  Despite being extremely busy, the waiters are courteous and on top of their game.  They also have a really great lunch menu, which many seem to forget about it."}
{"text":"Sunday morning after working overnight, craving red meat. Steak 'n' eggs.

Dropped in here on my way home after doing a quick browse and go for something open at 7am, and was pleasantly overwhelmed by the menu. The place was quiet, just opening, and not too many people yet. I decided that take-out would score points by coming home with brunch for two, and grabbed my protein fix, some French toast with caramelized bananas, and an all-around breakfast plate (eggs, meats, pancake, etc), and asked them to wrap it all up to go.

Zora didn't even blink. Just asked me how I would like my coffee.
Not even 15 minutes, and everything was bagged, tagged, and ready. Awesome.

The eggs were perfect, steak was good, potatoes rock. Only negative on the plate was the ham in the breakfast plate, it's not the thick sliced variety, but more of a charcuterie sandwich ham, and that lost them the 5th star. The French toast went down as an indulgent and decadent dessert. Was good but next time, I think I'll try the apple-cinnamon instead.

Didn't take photos, was too hungry, sorry. Definitely a repeat."}
{"text":"We had the Orange Cafe Benny and Veracruz Omelet... Not impressed.
The coffee was horrible, either burnt or overly bitter, our waiter was mute or shy, barely spoke a word. 
As for the dishes the \"Benny\" was an odd mix of Boiled and Creamed egg mixed with too much onion and a bit of mushroom and bacon with sauce on top of bread... All I could taste was the onion and boiled egg. 
The omelet was better, but the odd addition of celery to a otherwise decent salsa was confusing, ultimately overpowering the taste. 
The save face on these plates was the potatoes, which were nicely cooked and spiced. 
Fruit was mostly unexistent, just a slice of orange and melon was included. 
The odd combinations failed to impress, and for $34 with tip for two, I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"This place blows. I'm not even going to waste my time with a review. Food arrived cold and over cooked for all of our table then our waiter disappeared for an hour. When we asked where he went we were told \"he does that\" total waste of time and money. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in the area, hands down. Nothing fancy, but they do standard breakfast stuff properly and as expected. There's a bit of a line Saturday and Sunday morning, but it moves quickly.

They also do a decent lunch, I recommend the Georgia Salad.

UPDATE: I'm less fond of this place -- they screwed up my eggs benny the last couple times to the point of uneatable. I don't go here anymore."}
{"text":"Great place. Fast friendly service. Food is fresh and eggs are never overcooked! I eat healthy and they are always willing to accommodate my needs."}
{"text":"J'ai fait la découverte du café orange ce matin! Quel délice!! Un super menu de petit-déjeuners, tellement de choix c'est fou!!
J'ai pris l'omelette aux trois fromages qui venait avec de superbes patates et des toasts. Très heureuse de pouvoir avoir du pain marbré pour les toasts!!
Je compte bien y retourner, bon et pas cher avec un service excellent."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast, lots of choice and tasty. I tried it for dinner the other night, the up side was happy hour being all night. The down side, very slow service for an almost empty restaurant (meals took ovee 30 minutes to arrive) the jambalaya didn't taste very fresh and was lacking protein for the price. It's unfortunate because i wanted to like it but it really wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"A favorite brunch place at the edges of Westmount and The Monkland Village with a young clientele. If you don't time your visit right you could be subject to lines out onto the street. The lines are there for a reason, it is a great brunch place with a great ambiance."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time, it is a much more local spot, rather than a attraction. The atmosphere and decor of it, was pretty cozy and warm. There's nice framed photographs on the wall of the seats. And on the more \"bar\" side of it, there's a chalkboard with neon writing. Theres also 3 TVs spread across the room.

I got the \"Fill me up\" early bird , while my sister and cousin got the breakfast sandwich and my dad got the 2 eggs. The food was okay, not over the top, but not bad either. The eggs were runny :) bacon soft and crisp, but not overcooked, ordinary french toast and pancake. The best of the plate would be the potatoes, which came with green and red pepper slices and onion slices.
Maybe just the fact that the number of orange slices are inconsistent as some plates got 2 slices while others got 4.

For the other meals, the bread came in a basket with some peanut butter and jam."}
{"text":"Went here in the morning with a few buddies after a night out. We were seated promptly. We all ordered very simple items for the menu. We all asked for water at the same time. 15 minutes go by and still no water. We ask the waitress again for the water. Another 10 minutes go by and we ask for water from a bus boy. Over 30 minutes and still no water and no food... Finally our food comes out and we ask for the water again. She comes back with the very sought after water. We start on our food to find its dry out and cold... Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a hankering for breakfast while driving through Notre-dame-de-Grâce, so we put our faith in Google reviews and stopped by Orange Cafe. Although it was raining at the time, we still had to wait in a short line, so it appears as if Orange Cafe is a local favourite. 

The restaurant has entirely booth seating. It has plenty of orange trim, and decor with a mellow vibe, which is nice considering how much constant hustle & bustle there is in the space. Although the place is busy, they've worked up a pretty efficient system, so you'll be seated pretty soon.

When in Montreal you are legally obligated to consume smoked meat of some sort, so I opted for their smoked salmon eggs Benedict dish; the Pacific. With this dish you'll get eggs Benedict, smoked Canadian Pacific salmon, and manouri cheese served on a toasted bagel. On the side you'll get a slice of cantaloupe and grapefruit, plus some home fries. The eggs Benedict portion of the dish was a stellar start. I've typically not cared for hollandaise sauce, but Orange Cafe serves you up a mild sauce with enough flavour that it isn't a waste of time & calories. Furthermore, it pairs excellently with the flavourful and salty smoked salmon. After you go and release that beautiful egg yolk, you've got a breakfast delight that will start any day right.
To speak to the sides, the home fries are fantastically seasoned, but they lose points since they're not at all crispy. The slice of cantaloupe was pointlessly small. 

All in all, Orange Cafe really hit the spot. It's hard to do breakfast food wrong, but they do it pretty damn well. Come through!"}
{"text":"So many rave reviews but I was far from impressed by this place. 

We ordered a few breakfasts, I got my usual eggs benedict because who wants to make their own hollandaise?

I was confused as to why they used regular white bread(they call it \"grilled Parisian bread on the menu but is bs) as their benedict bottom, didn't really hold up well to the mountain of hollandaise. 

The sauce itself wasn't very good, spicy, for some strange reason and kind of bland otherwise. Like they accidentally dumped on some cayenne and just decided to live with it. 

One friend had ordered the creamed egg and ate only a few bites because she did not enjoy it. 

Another had one of their omelettes, western I believe, which was more of an egg scramble with chunks of veggies, nothing special but passable. 

And finally someone had their larger breakfast (eggs, meat, pancake, hashbrowns etc) which was fine. 

Their hashbrowns were good though! 

Wasn't too busy, or overly clean, just a regular diner feel with Anglo service. 

Just another lower quality Montréal institution. People, please, there is better food out there and we have to strive to find it instead of just accepting so much mediocre stuff around the city."}
{"text":"Good reliable brunch place in NDG.  The exterior is deceptive, it's very nondescript, you'd walk past it a dozen times and never think to go in.  Inside though it's a fairly large space with cute photos of the neighbourhood on the walls, playing up the \"orange\" in the cafe's name. 

They have a nice broad brunch menu, with lots of smoothies, egg options and the usual pancake and waffles.  I had the veggie omelette which came with toast and a generous helping of home fries which were very good, came with lots of big chunks of onion and bell pepper mixed in.  Portions are big but not overwhelmingly so. Coffee is decent and refills are prompt.  Service is efficient and friendly.

There's usually a lineup on weekends starting around 11, so get there early.  If you are stuck waiting, you can always go for a browse at the used bookstore next door!"}
{"text":"This place is getting 3 stars for the nice decor and general comfort, not the food which I would only give 2 stars.
We just left after going for the first time although we've lived in the area for a decade.

I ordered their classic eggs benedict ($11.95), he had the breakfast sandwich on a croissant (early bird special $9.95).

When the food came, it looked very nice.    Potatoes are actually real, not frozen.    Pink grapefruit slices are a nice touch instead of the traditional slice of tomato or orange that are generally on the side of a breakfast plate.     Here's where everything went south.

I don't know what mix they use for hollandaise sauce (which is already a travesty in my book - if you aren't going to make real hollandaise, you're cheap and lazy) but it was absolutely tasteless.    My benedict was not on English muffins, it was on slices of fried French bread.    The potatoes.....I kept trying to figure out why they tasted old, dry and of absolutely nothing.   How on earth did you screw up potatoes?    No salt or pepper - they had colour on them, but my guess is that they had made a huge batch earlier in the morning and had been sitting in the oven for hours.  The only nice thing about them was that they are cooked with red peppers and onions - they were the only thing with flavour on the plates besides the pink grapefruit slice. 

His meal.....he was eating very slowly, so I asked him how it was.    He said, \"In one word.....overdone.\"     The croissant was not fresh and was so toasted that it was dry and crumbling in his mouth.    The bacon was so hard he said it was beef jerky.   The cheese was a gross Kraft single which was still cold.    This got me curious.....I tasted everything on his plate and he was absolutely right.....dry, overcooked, tasteless.    

When we left, he said, \"That was the worst sandwich I can remember having.   It would have been better microwaved!\"

I wanted to like it, I really did.    It's lovely inside, the service was fine.....I would just not go back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I love coming here for brunch. The food is consistently good. Haven't had bad experiences with the service even though it's always busy.  It's worth the wait if there is a line. The Orange montreal decor is fun. The owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"Go there. You wont regret it!!!!!!!  Best breakfast around hands down!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is waaay bigger on the inside than what I thought when I first drove by. I came here on the recommendation of my friend and it did not disappoint. 

A pretty big breakfast selection was offered, and the portions were big. I went with the fresh fruit, yogurt and granola, and the yogurt there was pretty heavenly. I believe that they called it a Balkan yogurt. I also love that they had marble rye bread as a toast option. My friend ordered the breakfast club which came with home fries and it looked like it was a feast for 2. 

Unlike other reviews that I have read, I found our server to be quite pleasant. She was attentive on the coffee refills and took our orders promptly."}
{"text":"We've been up and down on this place over the years, but it has got its act together in the past year and the food is reliably decent; sometimes quite good. Another plus: coffee that's tasty and strong enough to be flavourful 
The $3 charge for real maple syrup seems unreasonable, but other prices are in line with other restaurants."}
{"text":"Can you say 'peanut butter banana smoothie'??! There are many reasons to come here for breakfast, lunch or brunch but the peanut butter banana smoothie is at the top of the list. The omelettes are great and they always give nice sized portions. My personal favorite is the Veracruz which has salsa, sour cream, avocado and cheddar. They have a pretty large menu so there's something for everyone including water for all of those who are gluten free, fat free, sugar free, taste free, etc. My only negative comment would be related to their bagels. They don't have good bagels which is a little sacrilegious considering Montreal has the best bagels on earth and they deliver to restaurants all over the city on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Ce resto est facilement ma place préférée pour le brunch la fin de semaine. Principalement anglophone, toute l'équipe vous y sert très bien en français. Il est très fréquemment plein vers midi. En Avant-midi il y a très peu de temps d'attente. La salle à manger est divisée en deux sections. La première est composée de banquettes et la deuxième de tables et de chaises. 

Maintenant pour le plus important la nourriture. Il y a trop de bonnes choses, difficile de faire un choix. Voici alors mes deux choix favoris. Premièrement, les ufs Bénédicte classiques, selon moi le meilleur en ville. Parfaitement exécuté service avec une vraie sauce hollandaise sur pain et jambon. 

Mon deuxième choix, je dois dire que plusieurs années ont passé avant que je me risque. Disons que le nom n'est pas rassurant. L'omelette verte à première vue semble bizarre, il suffit de ne pas trop la regarder... C'est une exclusion de saveurs et de textures. Elle contient du pesto, des tomates séchées, des oignons, du jambon, et bien d'autres choses. Assiette plutôt copieuse, sauriez-vous vous arrêter, je parie que non."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting worse. Came as a group and the manager was nothing short of rude. Could even asks him a question without him cutting us off giving us attitude. Because he wouldn't even listen to us he tried to seat our group of 8 as if we weren't together twice after being told otherwise. We asked if we could be sat at two booths of 4 that were open and side by side but instead say a different party there that came in 20 minutes after us. Rude management, poor service, food isn't good anymore. Won't be back."}
{"text":"It's a great place although it's located on Decarie not on Monkland but still for the next customers you won't be disappointed food is great service is awesome not expensive at all price corresponds very well to the quality of food distributed. Customers are beautiful and for the owner two thumbs up to keep the quality of service that he delivers great cafe cheers!!"}
{"text":"Amazing bloodys!! If you also love listening to early 2000 hip hop & r&b this is your place to eat!!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit out of the way, but if you're in the area it's a good local place to hit up for breakfast. It's not much to look at, but I didn't come here for the view.

We came (not too) early on a weekend in Winter, and were seated quickly. The place is big and looked like it had a high turn-over of customers. The service was solid; quick, with no fuss. Just what I look for in a breakfast place when I'm hung-over.

The big breakfast (I forget their name for it) was good, and for a reasonable price. It was anything ground-breaking, just good Quebec fare."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, and has improved in the past 2 years or so. 

Service is also better but it depends on the waiter and can still be rushed. My visits are infrequent but the past several were quite good overall. 

Now, for the  \"coffee\": It is STILL absolutely horrible!  I have never drunk such weak coffee, except in cheap cafeterias! If this is a \"Café\" as your name suggests, your coffee is worse than McDonald's McCafé and Tim Horton's, even worse than Dunkin Donuts! Your management should try it and if they actually think it is tasty, then you should get new management/owners!!"}
{"text":"Generous portions, really tasty sausages and potatoes. Ok service. Orange juice price is a bit steep. Good for fun family outing or relaxed sits own with friends. Can get a bit loud inside if you're sensitive  to noises but it's a reflection of the happy crowd. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Cafe orange is one of my favourite brunch spots in NDG. I've never had a bad experience there. Don't let the outside fool you , inside The decor is comfortable and inviting and the service is quick friendly and efficient, our water glasses and coffee cups are always refilled promptly and we always get our food quickly. Not to mention the portions are very generous and the prices are very reasonable. There is almost always a lineup to get a seat though but it usually passes fairly quickly and is always worth the wait. The menu offers a lot of options for almost all tastes and even features some lunch options. I've tried quite a few items on their menu from classic eggs and bacon breakfast to their Benedicts to their breakfast sandwiches , crepes and omelettes and enjoyed them all! Their freshly squeezed juices , Mimosas and coffees are all very good as well. There is mainly indoor seating both tables booths and bar but in the summer there is some outdoor seating as well. This is a solid brunch option that I would highly recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"This place is honestly amazing! I get the full me up every time. Get my eggs and chocolate crepes. The people here are so nice and inviting. It's always packed when I go but they turnover tables so fast you'll get a seat in no time!! When you order you don't even have a chance to play a round of charades! I recommend this place to everyone! and everyone says it's just as amazing."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at their offerings for breakfast, I have been a resident of NDG for the better part of 8 years and have passed by this establishment many many times before today when my girlfriend and I decided to dine here for a late breakfast. 

It was a very decent meal, I really have nothing negative to say about this restaurant. If your looking for a good no frills breakfast, and pay a respectable price. This is a good place to head to. Maybe if I had to say one thing it was the host at the door, he looked like he was fed up of his job, the whole time I was there I did not see him greet ONE guest with a smile. Maybe just a bad day. No excuse it's your guests first impression of your establishment. 

He's better suited for a back of house position."}
{"text":"Florentine Me

   Part and parcel of a hard night of drinking at Honey's is a sloppy Benedict from Orange Cafe. There tends to be a line that develops quickly so word to the wise, sit at the bar but I swear to god, if I wind up waiting for a bar seat as a result of this review, I will not be pleased.

   Good coffee and they don't mind if you take it outside for a smoke on a nice spring morning...you know, to enjoy the fresh air. They have pretty bitchen' smoothies that, for all intents and purposes, will cure what ails you and if the does not work...well...your sitting at the bar, put you mind too it.
   
  The male servers at this place tend to be jerks, yet another reason to sit at the bar..plus it is always fun to jump the line. I like the Florentine, Benedictwise. Something about the brie and spinach just gets me and they have a Cajunish seasoning on the home fries, that gives them a nice bite. A solid breakfast all around. 

   Should you not be one for the Benedicts, they do everything from a Monte Cristo to burgers after 11:00am so you can't go wrong and it is all good n' greasy.

  See ya there.

{"text":"The spinach omlette is consistently good. It's clean and popular. I lived above this place for over a year and my roommate frequently went downstairs with her boyfriend to eat and she's the daughter of two chefs, so it is definitely reasonable."}
{"text":"My sister and mom first discovered this restaurant. Located up the hill in NDG nearby Westmount- this cafe offers a variety of delicious food with large portions at affordable price! Salads for lunch are the best for me and this place has a lot of salad choices! Love it and we go back at least once a month!"}
{"text":"Pour débuter officiellement les vacances, quoi de mieux que des bons ufs bénédictines? Au Orange Café, vous serez bien servis. Ils ont une très grande variété d'ufs bénédictines et une sauce divine, crémeuse et pleine de bon beurre. Vous avez même l'option de changer le pain français qu'ils utilisent au lieu d'un muffin anglais pour la version pain doré. Décadent! Et ça n'est pas tout. Ils ont des déjeuners pour tous les goûts : des ufs, des omelettes, des crêpes, du pain doré et des repas santé comme des fruits avec yogourt. Le café est bien ordinaire et vos tasses sont remplies autant de fois que vous le désirez. Bien que l'avis de Matthew P recommande de s'asseoir au bar, j'étais dans une banquette et c'était bien confortable aussi. Le service est très bien et on a donc surtout l'impression d'être dans un resto de style Cora, mais avec des gens du quartier et sans les fausses poules sur les murs!"}

{"text":"We really enjoy our almost monthly brunch smorgasbords at Orange!

Pros:  Portions are generous, service is quick (we're usually there on weekends around 10am) and generally friendly, though it does vary depending on the staff.  The menu is extensive, so if you've a sweet or savoury craving, ravenous or merely peckish,  they've got you covered.   They've a nice kids menu, booster seats and high chairs, and comfy booths as well as tables.   

Cons: I've been a client for several years now and have noticed a decrease in quality in two items in particular.   I used to rave about the fluffy hot potatoes, but they've been hit or miss over the last 3 months.  The hollandaise sauce has also changed - I don't believe it's house made anymore, which is a pity as it used to be delicious.  

It can be noisy when crowded, but I don't mind - it's lively and lovely to see so many people out on a weekend morning!   If you go after 10:30 on  weekend morning, expect a fair sized line up, though I've never had to wait more than 15 mins."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place if you go during \" lève-tôt \" hours for the prices (Monday-Friday). Otherwise, I find it a tad expensive. The portions are generous. The potatoes are different then the other restaurants. They're roasted, perhaps deep fried, sautéed with peppers and onions. A new ce twist! I also liked that the ham was grilled and not heated on a greasy griddle. Also, I would of liked it if my plate came out hot and not warm. The service is really good and fast."}

The menu has a lot of variety and a good English explanation. 
I ordered a pretty standard eggs and crepes. And a orange/banana smoothly which was delicious. They have many smoothies and juices. My hubby ordered the Uber healthy salad with tuna which was fantastic! 
Service is good. They check up on you and refill the water often. 
Chill atmosphere. Can sit outside if it's a nice day. 
There is no wifi. 
No skim milk."}
