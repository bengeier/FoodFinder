{"text":"This place is by my boyfriend's work, and he loves coming here for lunch. He gets the chicken rice bowl or burrito and likes both equally. Recently we went here to get dinner and I got the chicken sandwich. The sandwich was juicy and delicious. It's on par with habit burger chicken sandwiches, which are my favorite. Definitely worth trying or anything else on the menu as my boyfriend swears by everything he's tried."}
{"text":"So excited we found this amazing joint! Pineapple Grill would be a great stop for Diners, Drive-In's & Dives. We had the steak and rice bowls with grilled pineapple. The flavors are a pleasant surprise from the ordinary everyday restaurants. The decor is confusing but the strong smell of mesquite grilled goodness is amazing and assures you that you've picked the right place to sit and enjoy a wonderful meal. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner! Very friendly staff and food is awesome! Highly recommend this place!  Ed T Mesa Az"}
{"text":"Awesome place to try. Excited to come back and try other menu items. Super personable staff, very clean and modern  establishment, and food was great. Gotta try the jalapeno pineapple sauce."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  This little gem is hidden away around the corner from Staples.  I have eaten the pineapple salad - fresh,  quality ingredients and made with care.  It was delicious.  Then I went back for their burger - handed chopped beef,  provolone cheese,  great onions - one of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  I highly recommend this place.  Worth a drive to eat here!"}
{"text":"Amazing Fresh Food. My hubby said it was the BEST Burger he has ever had. My daughter had the cheesesteak and sighed with every bite!  The pineapple jalapeño sauce is AMAZING"}
{"text":"The Pineapple Burger is the best burger I have ever had in my life.....I'm almost 40 and I have been eating at least 1 burger a week as long as I can remember. This is no joke the best beef I have ever tasted. The sauces and other ingredients just put it over the top. I'm going to tell my friends and family to come back with me. Staff was super nice and place was very clean. Get it while it lasts!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food. What more can you ask for.  I highly recommend there jalapeño pineapple sauce and cucumber sauce both amazing.  I couldn't stop dunking my chicken and steak in both of them!!!"}
{"text":"Glad to see John opened another restaurant in the area. I like private owned restaurants. Dillon is the young man at the counter. Very knowledgeable of their food and tastes. Was a wealth of information in my choices. John is the owner and cook. I ordered the Chicken and Beef rice plate. The beef is Ribeye pieces. The chicken was great. Skewers are cooked on an open flame grill that you can see from the lobby and watch him cook if you please. The entire meal was enjoyable and as expected after Dillon told me what it would be. I am definitely going back. I saw the Pineapple Burger that someone ordered and that is my next target. :)"}
{"text":"So I wanted to try something out of my routine today. I ended up here and I don't regret it at all. The guy at the front was really nice and made recommendations. When he brought my order out, he included some pineapple jalapeño salsa. It was delish!!! I had a great overall experience and I recommend this simple little place to anyone and everyone. As I was leaving, the chef recommended the pineapple chicken sandwich. I'm not gonna argue and give that bad boy a try next time..."}
{"text":"We just ate a bowl here...it was delicious and fresh. We got the steak and chicken and both meats were so tender and had amazing flavor.  We tried all three sauces on the side and all were good.  This was delicious and healthy and we would highly recommend this place.  The zucchini was also delicious and we added grilled pineapple, which was unique and an added  bonus of flavor.  Dillon waited on us at the counter and was so pleasant and knowledgeable as far as the menu and what to order.  Come and try this place out as they have a great variety of food to choose from!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this week- awesome food!! The guys were super friendly. Menu was a bit confusing but the rice bowl I got was really good! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place is great! I had the Chicken Bowl with Pineapple Jalapeño salsa. Good sized portion and was delicious.  I recommend eating here. The place is clean and everyone working there is super friendly. The price of my lunch was very responsible. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is place is a gem. If you're not eating here, then it's time to get your life in order. I had the rice bowl with chicken. It was delicious, healthy, and filling. Great menu. Great options. Give this place your money, end of story."}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time. Amazing, food and service were great. Had the cheesesteak sandwich and the wife had the steak tacos and a side of beans. The steak was tender and the bread fresh, plus you can put wiz on it, which is the way to go. The tacos were awesome and you can tell that the vegies that they put on it are fresh. We had the put the Jalapeno Pineapple on the side. That sauce is delicious, I would put that on just about anything. I even asked if they sell it by the bottle, they don't. It is refreshing with a little bit of heat at the end. I thought the prices were inline with what you get. Will be back. If you go don't forget the sauce."}
{"text":"Super delicious, healthy, decently priced, and excellent customer service. My chicken rice bowl was so fantastic. Cant go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"Vegetarians and Meat eaters will love this place. We have been coming here since they opened. My husband lives the steak tacos and the steak rice bowl. I lo e the steakburger and fries. Try their caliranch sauce or their pineapple jalapeno sauce. The staff is so kind and friendly. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Pineapple Grill is a nice place to eat with a nice open atmosphere. The food was delicious and the service was great!! The server Dillon was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Another visit to Pineapple Grill last Friday night and it was great! I had the Pineapple burger and partner had the Philly cheese steak again. Both were as tasty as the last time. The pineapple for my burger was grilled and I had it on the side. So good! It's extremely wonderful that you can get anything on the menu cooked to order here. My partner's cheese steak was prepared sans onions, just the way he likes it, and thick with tender beef and provolone. Yum! The fries on the side were hot and crispy yet soft inside. I don't know how they get them that way. So tasty.  They've recently remodeled and removed the waterfall (boo!) but added more seating. Still the same two guys running the place and service is fast and friendly.   Prices are very reasonable for the top notch food. IMO, this is the best burger spot in East Mesa by a long shot and the best cheese steak in Arizona. They're next to Bellagio's on the south side of McKellips."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Super bummed I didn't know about this place sooner. My husband, who considers himself to be a burger connoisseur, ordered the Pineapple burger. He said that it was, \"the best burger he's had in Mesa\". I ordered the pineapple chicken sandwich is HUGE and delicious. We shared an order of fries which was plenty for the two of us. They have a plethora of unique sauces to choose from, the Cali Ranch and Jalapeño Pineapple will not let your pallet down. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Absolutely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Go here now!!! I wish there were more locations and I will definitely come back when I'm in the area. I had a Philly cheesesteak and my friend got a pineapple salad that was so amazing! The sauce man Dillon hooked it up with some chipotle mayo and this amazing pineapple jalapeño purée sauce that was delicious on my cheesesteak and on the salad! Fries were great too! I'm so glad I found this place on yelp because it's at the very end of a strip mall, around the corner from Walmart."}
{"text":"The steak tacos are amazing! Add the salsa, jalapeño pineapple and the ranch and they're so so tasty!"}
{"text":"Friendly service:  check. Clean, and with a nice casual atmosphere: check. Fresh ingredients: check.  I tried the bowl - was originally going to get the vegetarian bowl but the gentleman helping me convinced me the chicken was great - fresh chicken breast, flavored nicely.  And it did not disappoint!  I got the chicken strips for my son (they have high chairs!) and it was nice to have a food option for my picky kiddo.  Oh, and I don't know what the story is with the ranch dressing, but it looked homemade.  Tasted great, too.  I will have to go back to try the philly cheese steak.   I also ordered some baklava to go... haven't tried it yet but am looking forward to it.  Honestly, what really sold this place for me was how helpful, thoughtful, and friendly the guy was who rang me up and brought out my food.  I've seen several different businesses come and go at this location over the years; I hope to see this one stick around.  ETA:  I tried the baklava and it was SO GOOD I had to make sure I posted about it.  Ever since my ex-coworker's Greek grandmother set the bar super high, I have yet to find a baklava that doesn't taste dry and bland.  NOT THIS ONE!  Some of the best baklava I have had in a long, long time."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time about 3 weeks ago. When I walked in I was greeted and ordered a small caesar salad at their counter. It was huge and very yummy! The young gentleman that took my order came over and made sure I was pleased. I'm looking forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I actually feel fresh and clean eating it. The pineapple sauce is so good. For sure I will be back. The only set back is that the restaurant feels hot to sit and dine in."}
{"text":"Tasty food and great prices! Their pineapple salsa was unique and I would love to try it on some chicken but we ordered steak tacos and a steak quesadilla. My only complaint is no hot salsa available though their salsa does have great flavor! Definitely will go back. The customer service was amazing as well. Friendly guy working the cash register and we even got a smile and a thank you for coming in from the guy working the grill."}
{"text":"Food here is so good....delicious fries. Employees are really nice and helpful as well"}
{"text":"Start to finish, I loved the Pineapple Grill! Dillon, our waiter was very friendly, efficient and happy to serve. My son ordered the Lamb Cheesesteak with grilled pineapple, fries and a soda. I ordered the ribeye cheesesteak with grilled pineapple. Both were served within a few minutes, were hand prepared, piping hot and absolutely delicious! I will invite my friends to this place, and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! I love pineapple. The Jalapeno Pinapple sauce is amazing. It's the perfect balance of heat, sweet, and citrus. Has no \"pepper\" tones to it which is ideal (as jalapeno is my least favorite pepper). I will for sure be back to work my way through the menu.  The staff is just as AMAZING as the food.  Katie was so helpful and attentive. She makes the environment so inviting and chill. I feel like I'm dining with good friends and good food.  Started today's adventure with a rice bowl and pistachio baklava for dessert."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars since I'm not sure about the food.   First,  the acustics inside make it difficult to hear the staff if you're standing at the door and he talks to you.  The room is ice cold,  so I shivered the entire meal.   It's clean yet still under construction a bit.   The food choice is similar to the motif, it is eclectic.  The atmosphere is rustic new Mexico, with a log cabin feel, with both industrial and blingy lighting.   Industrial tables and chairs and a few red velvet Vegas high table chairs.  The food is a combination of American, Greek, Mexican and Asian,  depending on the sauce(s) you choose.   I was taken by surprise when the same guy working on the kitchen door was the same person who cooked the food.  Only one glove was on as he plated our food.   The ungloved hand did touch the food unfortunately.  ( I had ecoli last year and was in the hospital so I do pay attention to that.)   The food itself was okay, not exceptional.   Would I go back?    Probably not,  nice staff though."}
{"text":"Stopped here the other day after the gym. Got a chicken rice bowl and it was very good!  The rice and chicken were delicious. Nice to have another healthy option that is quick. Will definitely be stopping here again!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Was on my way to get Pizza for lunch and drove past. Flipped around and decided to give Pineapple Grill a try. Glad I did. I ordered the special of the day. The burger with fries. Terrific juicy burger and the fries had a great season on them. Next time I am going to try the Philly Cheese Steak. The place was comfortable but the large water feature in the middle of the room kind of felt awkward. The staff (father/son) was very friendly and informative. They certainly have pride in what they do!"}
{"text":"The food here is AWESOME! Freshly made, not frozen reheated crap. The decor isn't anything to write home about, but this is for sure a new favorite place that I will frequent!"}
{"text":"No. No. No, absolutely not. There are better places where you can spend your money and your time . . . And have a better experience.   Maybe I should drink more of the Kool-Aid made with the water in NE Mesa . . . Looking over the recent reviews of Pineapple Grill, I anticipated finding another diamond in the rough.  But no, from the moment I entered to the moment I left my food, uneaten on the table, after being told I didn't know what I was talking about, I have to say that I have never had a dining experience quite like I had here.    You should always listen to you gut, and I chose to ignore the red flags from the get-go.  It was lunchtime, on a weekday and there was just one other person leaving when I walked in.  The interior is a bit dark and is essentially the leftover fixtures and decor of previous businesses amalgamated into an odd arrangement that wants to be upscale quick-serve, but has odd touches of a stretched budget.  I was greeted by an employee, but was never offered recommendations, suggestions or assistance deciphering the menu.  The menu offers no guidance on what I can expect from any choice (Yelp has limited photos of their food) and the restaurant name only correlates to their Jalapeno Pineapple sauce and grilled pineapple offered with most dishes.  I truly don't know what their specialty is; nor was it apparent by their wide ranging but sparse menu.    My second red flag was my $25 bill for two dishes, without beverages (two of the soda fountain flavors had an \"Out of Order\" sign taped to them - third red flag?) Relying on the name of the menu offerings, I chose the Phenomenal Cheesesteak.  Phenomenal it was not; not in taste, not in size or price.  Lacking was beefy flavor, savory onion flavors, cheesiness and seasoning; the meat was totally overwhelmed by the bread (I noticed the name has since changed and \"Phenomenal\" has been removed).  I added fries, which were passable, but they were your standard Sysco 3/8\" French fry and, sadly, were the highlight of the meal.  Also ordered was a Steak & Chicken Rice Bowl, which by appearances looked amazing, however, the dish was not something that had distinct flavor, proportional seasoning, proper cook or tenderness . . . each bite was met with disappointment and the rice and vegetables stood in as stomach fillers, nothing more.  It was as if the both meals were procedural and were prepared without care, passion or joy - much like following a recipe without understanding technique, method or the science of cooking.  The chef/owner seemed to be just going through the motions to put food on a plate.  Because of the lack in flavor of the rice bowl, I returned to the counter to order a side of hummus in hopes of salvaging the rice bowl.  But asking $5 for a side of hummus, I said \"no thanks\" (I could not ignore another red flag).  Thankfully, better judgment prevailed and I walked out, leaving uneaten food on the table and shaking my head . . . a first for me.  It appears as though Pineapple Grill is searching for what it wants to be and is trying to offer items that appeal to a cross section of diners.  However, without doing any one particular thing well, and many things not so well, I have a hard time comprehending what the allure is and what keeps people coming back.  Perhaps I should have had more tap water to drink with my meal and I would have been filled with gastronomic euphoria that others seem to be experiencing.    Overall: 1.6 Quality: 1.8 Service: 1 Cleanliness: 2.5 Value: 1.8 Atmosphere: 1"}
{"text":"This is a hidden little gem. The food was incredibly good. I had the chicken and steak rice bowl. The meat was cooked over mesquite charcoal flame and you can taste it."}
{"text":"Really tasty spot for lunch. The portion was good(not too much), which I appreciate as someone who doesn't like wasting food but do not want to be fat. I got the rice bowl with chicken, and the veggies were steamed and the chicken was grilled, and there was not sauce all over the plate. Super healthy!  I wish they had green tea through!"}
{"text":"First visit today, had the pastrami pineapple sand which and it was amazing. The. Read alone was so soft inside and toasted on the outside. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Best place for lunch. Go there once or twice a week.  The owner, John cooks all the food right in front of you with all fresh ingredients. Dylan, the cashier has amazing customer service."}
{"text":"This place is sooo tasty.  The owner cares about his food and you'll know it once you eat there.  The salad was great and the rice bowls are a hit.  The grilled chicken was super moist.  Def make a trip over."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Great food for reasonable price. I went in tonight really looking forward to a good meal. They changed the menu and made the item I love more expensive... and not just a little increase in price, but a 40% increase!!! They just lost my business and from the looks of their empty restaurant, other regular customers may have bailed.  If they're interested in what their customers really want, they'll change the menu back to the way it was or at least stop overcharging their regular customers."}
{"text":"We just really like this place is quite cozy and the service was great. But the biggest part The food was really good. We were really impressed. The fries were fresh the cheesesteak sandwich was legit and my husband's burger was actually a great burger. We went to this place on yelp recommendation that's why I decided to yelp but it wasn't that busy in there so they need to kudos to get some business.  My husbands review it was good service was great go there. He's deep."}
{"text":"Authentic joint with wonderful food. I ordered a burger and it was with grilled pineapple, onion rings , fries, etc. The size of the meat was perhaps 6 to 7 ounces and cooked to perfection. Wife the 3 taco plate. They do a great and I am surprised the place is not full of people. They use mesquite charcoal and that adds to the flavor."}
{"text":"Can't believe we haven't tried this place before!  The atmosphere was pleasant and the staff delightful...very anxious to please.  The menu has a very nice variety and everything is reasonably priced.  We had a salad and a uniquely constructed grilled burrito.  There is a big variety of sauces to choose from.  I had the chipotle mayo.  My burrito had french fries inside which sounded really weird, but I am always up for something new.  I was astounded how well it tasted!  We plan on making this place a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"This a friendly little place with great sandwiches and go service. Food is tasty and full of flavor that explodes in your mouth with every bite. I am very happy I stopped in and would defiantly be going back in future. It's worth the stop. Everything is homemade and made fresh. I recommend the chicken philly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! Stopped in last minute and the guys were happy to help us at the end of their night!!! Thanks guys!! Great service, very clean, fast, and the food was delicious!!! The California greek salad is so bright and colorful. Very appealing to the eyes! The Philly cheese steak was the best around in this area, by far!!! And the lamb chop rice bowl beautiful, really clean tasting!! The lamb was cooked to perfection. Great, great place! Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review!  This place was too good not to review. We all had something different and the food was fantastic! Cozy, clean atmosphere and Dillon was polite and courteous. Great place to dine"}
{"text":"Dang good burger! I got the pineapple burger and was pleased with the unique combination of flavors. I could have used maybe some teriyaki sauce on the burger. We also got hummus and the cilantro jalapeño hummus was awesome. Not too spicy but had a great flavor. Service was fantastic. Will return!"}
{"text":"The pineapple burger topped with pineapple jalapeno sauce was excellent. The service was top notch too. I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"First time here and this place is amazing.  The aroma of the mesquite grill hits you right when you walk in the door.  The service is great, the price is fair and the food is VERY good."}
{"text":"Fast and delicious! I got the philly cheese steak w/fries. The fries have some delicious seasoning on them. I'm going to make this my new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  We stopped in because of the great reviews and we were not disappointed.  The  steak rice bowl delicious and the pineapple burger with fries....YUM!!!! Hot, fresh and absolutely wonderful!  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Super cute place! Service was great!! Food was yummy! Had the pineapple salad- fresh and yummy, and the chicken sandwich with the grilled pineapple- so good! They had coconut water- right from the coconut. May be one of our new local favs"}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean and Freshly made food. I had the Chicken Bowl with Spicy Pineapple Jalapeño sauce.     Bowl comes with Rice and black beans, lettuce, carrots and Brussels sprouts. It was as advertised - Fresh and really good. The size was dish was plentiful."}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie rice bowl and it was great. I love my sauces so I got all three, pineapple Jalapeño was my favorite, it was purty dang spicy.  The veggies were fresh and the rice was delicious.   The young man at the front taking orders was an absolute sweetheart. He's the main reason for my review. He displayed excellent customer service with a pure sense of generosity. If I lived in Mesa I would come more often, but I am north side native"}
{"text":"What amazing food!!! The Pineapple Burger was one of the best I've ever had... The meat was perfectly seasoned, the pineapple was subtle, the bun wasn't dry or crumbly, and the whole thing held together really well - not messy at all. The fries were really good - not my favorite, but a good compliment to the food. Very nice staff and food came out reasonably quickly.  The restaurant was very clean and felt modern  - if perhaps a little small in the dining area. Went for lunch and it wasn't bad, but I can see this place getting crowded.  Tons of variety on the menu - something for everyone! Buddy had a chicken sandwich and said it was good as well."}
{"text":"Great and quick service! Food was good and healthy (veggie rice bowl). I passed on the sauces. Didn't love them and felt the bowl with all the veggies and pineapple had enough flavor. Would definitely come back for a healthy lunch when on that side of town."}
{"text":"We were driving by, on our way to eat at Barrow's pizza when we noticed this place.  I convinced my boyfriend to eat here instead, with the hopes of giving a new place an excellent rating on Yelp.  The first thing I noticed was how clean the place is.  The bathroom is also very clean.  The atmosphere is comfortable.  The service was very good.  Price is reasonable.  He ordered the rice bowl with chicken and all the trimmings.  Along with the teriyaki sauce.  He said it had very good flavor, and was just the right amount.  A healthy, and tasty meal.  I had the Philly cheese steak, which was unfortunate.  It was made from ground beef that I'm pretty sure was chuck steak, and there was not an adequate amount of it for the bun.   It was NOT overflowing with thin sliced beef, oozing with provolone cheese like Philly Cheese steak sandwich is known to have.  The onions were cut in tiny pieces, and lost in the grizzly hamburger.  The taste of the American cheese overloaded any provolone that was in it.   The french fries were hot, crispy, and tasted great.   I'm sad to say, they would do well to either change their recipe all together, or take the Philly Cheese steak sandwich off the menu.  I do highly recommend the rice bowl."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a bite to eat and support your local business. The food was excellent the service was Superior and you must try their jalapeno pineapple spread! Highly recommended great job.  For those of you in a hurry for lunch or dinner order from the Patron app that they have and have your food ready to go when you get there or ready for you to eat when you dine in"}
{"text":"Fresh as you can get. Don't care for the tap water taste of the soda. Would love if they have bottled drinks available. I'll be back tho."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food and awesome customer service. They were so helpful and friendly. I have been to this place a few times over and have yet to be disappointed in the taste, flavor and attention to detail that they put into each plate."}
{"text":"Excellent pineapple burger!  Burgers where serve hot along with hot fries. That doesn't happen often. Their pineapple jalapeño homemade sauce was great. Be sure to try it."}
{"text":"Yummy! Very fresh. Good prices. Love the hummus. Had the ribeye cheesesteak which was delish!"}
{"text":"Great food! Came here for lunch today because I had heard the Philly cheese steaks are good which is true. The sandwich and fries were delicious and huge! Love that they put a lot of meat on it and it's not just bread. $12 for the combo, not bad for all that you get. The people were really friendly too! I came in just before noon and it wasn't too busy. I'm hoping more people find out about this place so it stays around."}
{"text":"Terrific Philly cheese steak. The staff was very friendly and seem to really appreciate each customer. Food was excellent."}
{"text":"This fast food restaurant has very friendly staff. I add the chicken burrito with pineapple sauce it was extremely good the only critique I could say is that would like to have a little more of the pineapple sauce. Which I'm sure if I asked where they would have given me. I will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"Awesome little sandwich and salad place.  Phenomenal hummus and pita bread.  Wonderful cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"Tried a new restaurant just to see what it was about. Limited menu, but oh my goodness! One of the most flavorful burgers EVER! My wife tried the steak-rice bowl. It too was delicious. Very nice staff and ambiance. We spoke with the owner (also very friendly and very helpful) and he talked about the care and preparation that goes into every dish. He is not kidding. We' will be back, and next time, we're bringing friends!"}
{"text":"The service was so great here and the staff is so polite and welcoming. This was my first time in and I am very happy to have found this place. Now that I work close by I will be coming in very often! Oh and of course the food is clean and very good! Can't wait to try the tacos and burgers if the rice bowl is this good!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and it was so good. We got the cheesesteak sub combo, the fries were cooked perfectly. The cheesesteak itself had a great toasted sub roll and the steak itself was well seasoned. My only complaints would be that the amount of steak could have been another ounce and that when you walk in they don't have the menu board written down. Hopefully both can be fixed but the amount of steak would not keep me from ordering it again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love it even more, if possible. Asked for a bunless burger and  the owner wrapped it with lettuce for. Keto Style!!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this little restaurant.  The service is great and our food was made by hand very timely and tasted great and the portions were excellent.  Support locally owned businesses.  Next time you go to Walmart or Staples give this great little place a try.  I didn't get the chance to have a burger, but the one that went by our table looked great, I just wish I wasn't full!  Hope they take off because Mesa needs good restaurants to choose from.  Best of Luck to them."}
{"text":"Just now leaving the Pineapple Grill. This is one of the best chicken sandwiches I have ever eaten! The bread was delicious and the chicken is grilled fresh. The flavor was amazing. We ordered the pineapple chicken sandwich. Comes on an 8 inch loaf and was enough to share. Probably a little on the pricey side. After you add fries and a drink makes it $12 but totally worth it! We will definitely be back to try a few other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Good portions, great taste, quick health options, and friendly service! Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick inexpensive meal. They have a good variety too but not so much that the choices are overwhelming. Support your local business!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go out and eat too. The customer service is amazing as well as the food and it has an amazing atmosphere! I recommend the food here to anyone, and I will continue sending people their way for their lunches and dinners. I will definitely be coming back here for my meals."}
{"text":"Chicken rice bowl is amazing and the German kid behind the counter should have is own sit com."}
{"text":"Had the double burger with pineapple and jalapeño sauce and fries. Very tasty! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This food is so yummy! I got the rice bowl with chicken. It comes with grilled veggies. You can choose a side sauce, but it is full of flavor and does not even need that. You can tell it's a newer place and is working out kinks, but service is fast and friendly. I will definitely come again when I'm on this side of town!"}
{"text":"It was very quiet inside. They had a \"grand opening\" sign, otherwise I would have thought the place was closed or the food not good enough to be busy at 7pm on a Friday. The staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. I opted for the veggie bowl. It was different than my expectation; everything was separate on the plate. That's not a bad thing, but not what I'd pictured.   The broccoli was severely over cooked, completely mush. The carrots were a little on the soft side, but not too bad. The food has little flavor. However, they do offer sauce choices. I opted to try the jalapeño pineapple and the yogurt cucumber, both on the side.  I LOVED both sauces. I would have them cooked into the dish next time, probably as the dish was intended to add more flavor. My fault for wanting to try then on the side!   I'd try the restaurant again based on the great sauces and staff. Hopefully they'll improve the veggies next time!"}
{"text":"Awesome Chicken & rice bowl! Grilled chicken was tender and not fatty, pineapple was sweet and juicy and the rice was full of flavor! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Best cheese steak in the east valley and the fries are delicious too. Everything cooked from fresh ingredients. The owners are super friendly, can't wait to go back and try the chicken tacos."}
{"text":"This is just one of those places you have to try. Their menu has a great variety of foods to try.   All of it is handmade, fresh right there in front of you.     I can't stress enough how great the flavors are.  Only been in town a month and have twice. Once the chicken rice bowl with black beans.  The second a pineapple burger with jalapeño sauce.  Incredible both times.     The guys running obviously have a passion for great food and ensuring your visit is pleasant."}
{"text":"Such delicious food!  I highly recommend this place.  They have burgers (my husband said one of the best he's ever had),  burritos, tacos and rice plates among others.  I had the chicken rice plate which I would describe as a fusion of Asian, Hawaiian and Mediterranean food.  So delicious and healthy.   I don't think I have had anything quite like it.  My taste buds were delighted and so was my Tummy."}
{"text":"I never got a chance to eat the food, because the day I went they were so in the weeds that despite assurances at order-time that it was fine, after 22 minutes I had to ask for a refund to return to work without lunch. I tried to be reasonable, but the way the situation was handled is why I had to go for the lowest 1-star review. Read on if you are interested!  When we arrived, they seemed backed up and the guy starts off with an apology for no reason, and spouts off something about a big order that caught them off guard. The unprompted excuse worried me, so I explicitly asked them about the wait, and explained I had to be back at work. \"No problem, we're past that.\"  So I ordered, and as I mentioned to start, after 22 minutes not only had we not been served, the last straw was seeing orders placed after ours be delivered. Up to the counter we go for our refund, and this is where it gets worse. The cashier understands our frustration, but needs the cook (owner? manager?) to sign into the register to issue the refund and that guy first tries some excuses, then instead of coming over to help finish the refund he continues to yell from the grill \"I CAN MAKE IT NOW!\"  Sorry buddy, at this point I don't care if you're Thomas Keller, I'm going back to work.  There were many ways they could have handled this better, but as they didn't, I won't bother going back."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We love it here, and come in at least once or twice a week! We always get the steak N chicken rice bowls and add grilled pineapple. The sauce we get is cucumber sour cream and it is the best! The staff is always so nice and the owner is always welcoming. It is so hard to find healthy fresh food and this place nailed it! Thank you Pineapple Grill for always making fresh, healthy, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to my house so I wanted to give it a try.  I walked in at 5:30 on a Sunday evening and I was the only customer there.  The menu is very eclectic.  Rice bowls, burritos, cheesesteaks and lamb chops.  I ordered a chicken rice bowl and fries.  The chicken rice bowl is a generous portion, but the taste is nothing special.  The rice itself was well cooked, but the veggie and chicken mix didn't have much flavor.  Fries were horrible and tasted like they had been sitting around for hours.  I know they weren't because I saw him drop the fries in the oil, so either this was an off batch or maybe they were just trying to crisp up some old fries.  I'm disappointed because I'd love to have another good option close to home, but I won't be going back here."}
{"text":"First off, I am unsure what the theme of this place is, which is very strange. The decor was strange with their golf tee tables, and out of a hooka joint high chairs covered in crushed velvet, I felt like I was in a Persian night club restaurant...  They had Philly Cheese-steak and then Hummus...it wasn't Mexican, nor was it Mediterranean. Upon our first visit, the place smelled horrible, it smelled like the grease trap needed cleaning or something. We had to wait outside while our meal was being cooked. As for the quality of the food, it was mediocre at best and was not next level quality or superiority. I could have sworn that my Rib Steak Sandwhich was just a Philly sandwich, similar to Steak umms. The cashier was super friendly, however, still a little pushy on the description of the foods, and mentioned to us that once we tsted the food, we would know the difference between fresh quality food, vs I suppose what they were serving. As if that place was the first place I had ever eaten at....well upon first taste, we were like, ohhh hell no, we arent going back for this....it wasnt that good. just mediocre. Will I return, probably not anytime soon....will I suggest this to other hungry people, no....Carls Jr. is right next door."}
{"text":"The cook yelled at me after I spent 13 dollars on my meal and stated that I did not want it because the chicken was rubbery (I didn't even ask for my money back, I just stated that I didn't want it)."}
{"text":"This place has a great mix of food, very friendly service, it's clean & in a good location. I had the Steak Burrito with the Jalapeño Pineapple Sauce,  I'll definitely be going back !"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great price. I was on a family vacation and we decided to try this place out. I ordered the grilled pineapple salad which was delicious. The server that was working there did a great job taking our orders right away. Loved this place and will definitely be back if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I found this on Yelp today and thought I'd give it a try.  Wow, my steak burger was just like a juicy steak and the salad I had with it was so crispy and fresh! They also lettuce wrapped my burger for a gluten free option. The service was delightful!  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Highly recommended Pineapple Grill! Everything we got was amazing, we ordered a few things so we could trying alot of things. We ordered the burger and fries, steak sandwich, grilled pineapple, baklava, and steak tacos. They have a blackberry jasmine green too, so yummy! Everything was cooked to perfection and cooked when you order it. The staff is VERY friendly. I have twin babies, went in to order to go and they even helped me out to my car. I will be going here alot more!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Definitely won't be the last. Fantastic food! Pineapple burger was delicious. Chicken burrito was delicious. Veggie burrito was delicious. Pineapple jalapeño sauce was sooo good! Everything we had as a family was awesome! Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"First visit was underwhelming  My wife asked what their specialty was and the answer was everything. I ordered a cheese steak sandwich with fries and a drink my wife ordered a rice bowl.  The sandwich was a sandwich with fries her salad came dry they gave her a teriyaki sauce to put on top of it which she didn't like and the next sauce was a cucumber sauce which was okay.  Kind of your standard burger place nothing unique about it."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try CB tonight.  The place is newly opened, and it looks like they are still getting things going.  The workers were helpful and friendly.  I opted for the steak rice bowl with the jalapeño pineapple sauce.  It tasted great, the meat was well cooked and I really liked the sauce.  They offered me a sample of the jalapeño hummus which also tasted great.  I'll definitely try CB again, was very filling.  I'll update again once I've tried a different dish and the place has been opened a little longer.  I think this place has a lot of potential for tasty food in an area of north Mesa that really could use some good restaurant options."}
{"text":"Great service! Very clean and the food has so much flavor. I got the chicken wrap with fries and I am in love. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food made from scratch. The owner and chef were very welcoming. The owner brought out a pineapple / jalapeño and special fry sauce for us. Both were great. The pineapple / jalapeño sauce was a great kick to the already tender and flavorful chicken philly. The children's chicken plate was marinated perfectly, and our 2 year old loved the fresh grilled chicken and seasoned fries. Will definitely be a regular spot for us now!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while visiting relatives, drawn by the rating.  Definitely deserving!  The guy behind the counter had an excellent in-depth knowledge of the menu, which is important for my dairy allergic wife.  The menu had a great variety, mostly pretty healthy, but also some yummy indulgences.  We settled on sharing a grilled pineapple salad and chicken tacos.  They were kind enough to split the salad for us, and serve plenty of dressing on the side.  The salad was great, but the tacos were definitely the highlight of the meal.  Marinated chicken breast and pico de gallo in perfect proportions.  Delicious tortillas.  If you can handle a little kick, DEFINITELY get the pineapple jalapeño salsa.  I'd rank it a medium heat, but added so much flavor.  We'll be back the next time we visit!"}
{"text":"Meh, this place was kind of odd. Food was just ok. Ambience was a little strange. Service was straight up awkward.  I was in the area with a friend and we were looking for a decent lunch. Mixed Yelp reviews here so hey, why not give it a shot and see for ourselves?! Right? Eh, maybe not this time...  From the very beginning it was a little weird walking in. Place looks like an old bar converted to a walk up counter, takeout spot with a few random tables and chairs. The sign and name just didn't really seem to match the ambience. Definitely could use  a makeover to brighten it up and make it look more appealing.   The girl at the cash register who also ended up serving us was an over-sharer. She made a lot of strange comments, including telling us she really had to pee - while ringing up our food order. Umm awkward! At one point she went outside to the front to vape. Yep, that really happened.   Our food was prepared on the grill by the chef (maybe also the owner?) and we could see him making it from our table. He definitely took pride in preparing it. The food itself was ok. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak and fries. To me the best part was the fries. I had to use a lot of ketchup on the cheesesteak bc it didn't have much flavor. My friend ordered the chicken bowl and said it was decent.   Came here with an open mind but I have to sat I was not expecting this experience."}
