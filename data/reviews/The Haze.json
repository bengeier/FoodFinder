{"text":"The food was okay.  The servers were not interested in selling much.  The bartender/server was very timid and almost afraid to speak up and tell us what tap beers were available. Also, we were a party of three at the bar having appetizers and she kept asking us if we wanted separate checks even though we said no.  The menu is on a chalkboard on one side of the restaurant. If you sitting at the bar, you cannot read it well given its position and the glare.  There is no written menu.  This could all be overlooked if the restaurant did well in other areas.  Unfortunately, it does not. I hope they get better help who really understand the important role they play in people actually enjoying their time there, as well as the food and beverages served."}
{"text":"Ban Me is totally amazingly delicious. Great (small) beer list. Hate the t.v."}
{"text":"Stop the insanity! I'm not sure why The Haze has been hit with so many mediocre reviews here, because I really think it's one of the coolest and most innovative BBQ places I've ever been to. Pick your choice of meat, then have it prepared Eastern-style or Western-style (accompanied by either rice or Texas toast) - what could be simpler yet more brilliant than that? And the food is excellent - similar to the standards of the other Muramoto restaurants but at a lower price, while still maintaining locally-sourced ingredients.   I suspect that to a lot of people out there, BBQ means dousing a piece of meat in brownish-red glop and throwing it on the grill. Maybe they're just not comfortable with this alternative take. Or maybe it's high expectations, or jealousy at the Muramoto chain's success: I don't know! I probably would've given 4.5 stars instead of 5 if I could, but there is NO WAY this place deserves to average 3 stars! I'd hate to lose one of my favorite restaurants because of a bunch of knuckleheads."}
{"text":"Love the pork bahn mi.  Great variety of sauces.  Every side I have tried has been very good.  They have a good tap beer selection."}
{"text":"Went last night with a group of girlfriends after we ditched Restaurant Muramoto for their hour and a half wait.  I was sad to see not many people there, because the food we got was OUTSTANDING.  I had the Bahn Mi, which is a favorite of mine anyway, and had one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  Had the seasonal said (noodle salad) and the french fries which were the best I've had in Madison.  Everyone at the table had something different and everyone was impressed with the amount and quality of food, especially for the reasonable prices.  We also had the fried pickles appetizer, which while insanely salty, were so delicious I almost licked the bowl. The ambience wasn't 100% (lights were a little bright) but service was excellent.  For $95, six of us drank, ate, and had an appetizer.  Can't wait to go back!  Love the mix of flavors."}
{"text":"Super delicious.  Definitely get the celery root mash!  Huge portions: I certainly could have come home full with a nice lunch for the next day...  But it was just so yummy, I couldn't stop myself.  Be prepared for a fairly long wait on a Friday night - they told me 45 mins, and I ended up waiting about 20 for 2 seats the bar.  The nice thing was that they took my cell phone number so I didn't have to stand around the whole time - and in the end, the bar was a perfectly pleasant place to eat."}
{"text":"Not sorry I tried it...food was good enough, but not a real value to come rushing back for, like it is at the two Muramoto locations...of course, I hope Haze succeeds, but it's quite often quiet when I walk by..."}
{"text":"I've been to The Haze a couple of times now and walked past it both times. The signage kind of blends in, maybe an homage to those little restaurants in Japan with little or no signage. I give the BBQ dishes here 3 stars, but the sides get 5, which I figure to be an average of 4. There's little smokiness to the meat (I've had both the pork ribs and the chicken - the ribs were better), but the sauce was decent. The real stars were the interesting sides, many of them local and seasonal. Homemade pickles, tart and fresh, baked beans reminiscent of a classed up \"calico bean\" recipe, hominy, potato salad - all winners. Nice selection of beer for a modest number of taps. Congrats on not only picking quality breweries, but also a nice range of styles on the 4 or 5 taps they have (can't remember the exact number, I may have sampled all of them in the same night). Would this be the place to satisfy my BBQ craving? Probably not, but I haven't found a local joint that has wowed me yet (I buy extra sides of baby back ribs at Jim's Rib Haven in Rock Island until I can find a worthy replacement).  The Haze would be the place I'd stop for some appetizers and a couple of beers with friends though. Too bad their pouteine (french fries covered in melted cheese curds and gravy - the national dish of Canada) is only available from 3 pm to 6 pm."}
{"text":"after living in the south - we pride ourselves on knowing good barbeque and THIS IS IT. really enjoyed our meal and the staff at Haze and plan to go back soon. the brisket was perfect, the sauces were very tasty and i've been craving the homemade pickles since we left. looking forward to our next visit.   4/5 stars b/c even though it is a bbq joint, i'd kinda like table service since i'm paying table service prices. other than that - love it!"}
{"text":"No matter what type of BBQ you like, Haze is going to have something for you. I spent 9 months backpacking around SE Asia years ago and developed a hankerin' for Bahn Mi, a Vietnamese/Lao sandwich. After about 6 months of no bread in other SE Asian countries, finding a french loaf sandwich was a godsend.   At Haze,they do it up right. Much better than the cheap (and overly salty) knockoff at the newly opened Graze a block away. Don't get them confused.  I love that you can get your own sauce in the back and experiment. I've also tried a couple of the asian BBQ dishes and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"First visit in the summer of 2010 was very good.  However, the menu is completely different now (the old east-west BBQ concept has been thoroughly filtered out) and now there is a wait staff.  The chicken is bad in more ways than one (dry and horribly seasoned for the BBQ sauces).  The pulled pork is ave at best.  Mashed potatoes were just bad (Garlicy & sweet w/o any noticeable seasoning).  I will never be back after this experience."}
{"text":"the best thing at this restaurant is the Vietnamese pork banh mi lunch specials.  Get the lemongrass-infused sausage (pork) and a side of asparagus or whtaever seasonal veggies they have on the menu.  I'm used to banh mi costing me $2.50, but that's in a different US regional context.  Nice interior, I knew it as the former site of Sushi Muramoto's, which I adore. These are managed by the same owners, me thinks.  The BBQ could be better, given it's Madison."}
{"text":"Maybe I just had a one-off bad experience, but I had the most disappointing meal in quite some time.   My pork was lukewarm and flavorless -almost tasted a bit soupy. The rest of my food was pretty cold.  Overall, it reminded me of dorm food.  I'd be willing to give them a second chance, but I'll need some convincing."}
{"text":"I have to preface this review by admitting that I do not eat meat. But that being said, if I were reviewing this restauant for all the vegetarians out there, this would be a two star review. There is not much on the menu for non-meat eaters. I am giving this a three star review because I am incorporating the feedback from my carnivorous co-eaters.  I ordered fries, black bean soup, and their homemade pickles. Generally, I like to try fries at BBQ places that don't serve BBQ shrimp so that I can sample the sauces.  The Haze's classic BBQ sauce grew on me; it was very sweet at first, but I ended up really liking it. The black bean soup was mediocre, and the pickles were more sweet than dill, and not my cup of tea.   My meat eating friends reported mostly positive comments on our visit. My one friend mentioned that his meal was much better on his first visit to the Haze. Overall, though, i did not get a sense of overwhelming satisfaction.  Finally, the Haze gets a big half star for very friendly service and a nice warm decor. Definitely a must-check-out for the Madison area BBQ fanatics... but maybe don't bring your veggie friends ;-)"}
{"text":"\"Purple haze all in my brain, lately things just don't seem the same. Actin' funny, but I don't know why. 'Scuse me while I kiss the sky...\"  The Haze is here! And, although I think the name might be a little misleading in a college town (hazing, anyone?), I'm mighty impressed with the new Kushi Bar reincarnation. Apparently, \"haze\" is a reference to the smoke coming from a bbq smoker. Today was their opening day, so I popped in for a late lunch and was immediately greeted by a very knowledgeable server and GIANT blackboard of BBQ options. You order at the counter, give your name, and find a seat. The seating and a lot of the decor/woodwork hasn't changed from Kushi Bar days. One note on the blackboard? It's cool, I like it. But there are so many different \"chalk fonts\" on the board, it's a little chaotic and somewhat difficult to navigate.  I already knew that I wanted to try a Bahn Mi sandwich ($7.99), but I wasn't prepared for all the options of sides! Out of house-cut fries, cole slaw, vegetarian beans, potato salad, spiced sweet potatoes, and Brussels sprouts, I chose the sprouts. Huh? I did what? Well, I happen to love those ugly little green things. And at The Haze, they're lovingly braised in lots of butter. So, back to the actual sandwich. Tender, flavorful, moist pulled pork paired with a pork pate on a french bread roll. Porktacular! Since I moved to Madison a few months ago, I've been afraid that I would transform into half cheese. Now I know what the other half will be: pork.   The bahn mi featured delicious pickled vegetables and fresh cilantro, along with jalapeno peppers. The Haze makes all their own pickles, but the jalapeno peppers looked like the canned variety. Please, may we have fresh peppers? The bread roll was a little tough for my tastes, but sometimes I don't eat the roll anyway.  I'm only throwing out four ninja Yelp stars for now, until I have a chance to go back for dinner and try their big plates. To order, you pick a meat, then pick Eastern or Western style, then two sides. For example, you could get spicy miso brisket served with rice OR you could go American and get dry rubbed brisket with Texas toast. Yee haw! Shoot, I think I'll just go back tonight for dinner, ya'll."}
{"text":"the bbq w/ classic sauce is pretty good. sometimes they're a little overcooked though. the banh mi sandwiches did not live up to their reviews. i've had authentic banh mi and this one wasn't it. definitely didn't even taste like a banh mi sandwich. probably won't come back too often, maybe only for the ribs."}
