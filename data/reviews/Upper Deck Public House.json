{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Ordered the nachos and pepperoni and mushroom pizza to share between two of us and ended up bringing most of it home. Nice atmosphere, good drinks. Nice place to spend a night watching sports on the patio"}
{"text":"Great local sports bar. Staff are a delight to deal with. Even Heather isn't horrible. Food is fresh and everything you need in a sports bar."}
{"text":"Great Friday deals and other great everyday deals awesome food. Survis and staff a great place to hang out"}
{"text":"For what it is, especially in an area that is not surrounded by pubs, it is very good. The servers are very friendly, the food is delicious and very well priced. $4.99 steak sandwiches on Mondays and Fridays. The lobster ravioli is just divine, you get big chunks of lobster, one of the best I have had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Crave this place all the time!  BEST pizza EVER.  Friendly service and great beer selection = happy girl"}
{"text":"Upper Deck is a gem of a pub! It is our regular place for Wednesday nights wings. Good for casual get togethers. The food is top notch, and though I haven't tried one yet, I hear that the calzones are amazing. They are always bringing in seasonal beers and do have some interesting selections on tap. Parking isn't too hard to find in this area either."}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch on Friday.  The crowd was thinning out, so it wasn't too busy.  Ordered the steak sandwich with a side of poutine!! Lovely :)  Can't wait to go back to try out more food!"}
{"text":"The menu is something else. They offer things that you wouldn't find easily in other places. The food is great! They do take some time to bring the food but as a restaurant or pub is a place you have to try. I recommend it 100% and will come back soon."}
{"text":"Anyone living in the area will know the assortment of shifty establishments that have been in and out of this location in the last 5 years. This had been the best one so far and I hope it stays. The food is delicious and very reasonable. They have an great assortment of menu items on special every week and same for the drinks. The servers are all very nice and provide great service. I recently brought in a table of 12 and my drink was never empty. I was surprised the service was that attentive. I have yet to have a slightly less than great experience here. I'm glad it's within crawling distance home."}
{"text":"Great appetizers and great service. The Mexi Stick appetizers are fantastic and the bartenders are friendly and attractive!  Especially Holly!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the creamy buffalo wings! The service was amazing from the bartender beau, she absolutely rocked! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer but have seen great changes over last couple of months including jumbo wings, fresh salad and wider selection of wines. Got me excited with the changes and love to visit as often as possible"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere for a Tuesday night! Comedy night is pretty good too. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Good beer deals and decent food. We all got the cheesesteak dip which was good (but nothing over the top amazing) but I can't speak for much else on the menu. Would highly recommend the onion rings though! Overall we had pretty good customer service as well."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! We've been on several occasions. Everything seems to be made fresh in house.  Great quality. We've never had a bad experience.  For just a simple relaxing pint and a nice pub meal - this place is THE place to go in the downtown west side. I HAVE to go back to try their \"Double Decker\" - massive burger slammed between two grilled cheese and bacon sandwiches! mmmmm - clogging arteries!  ****** I went tonight with some friends, for our \"Fat-Guy Challange\". While I'm sad to report that I could not eat the entire portion of \"The Double Decker\" - I gave it my all but was sadly bested by the behemoth! It is humanly possible to finish this burger though - one of the guys in our group finished it in under 15min!  Seriously though - I've tried other burgers in this \"extreme\" category and this is by far the best one I've eaten! Tasty and not too salty, or greasy. Obviously, with the amount of cheese on it - it is definately a once in a lifetime kinda meal...but wow what fun! Just look at my pics!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood pub surrounded by the west Calgary apartment high-rise buildings. We stopped by here on a whim for a nightcap while walking home to Kensington (which is just over the 14th street bridge from Upper Deck).  Friendly locals and bartenders. I will second the opinion of bartender Beaux (Beau?) who definitely rocks and super friendly. The atmosphere is sports pub, very roomy with some classic video games. They have several beers on draft and probably 2-3 dozen in bottles. We were surprised how quiet and empty the bar was on a Friday night at 9pm, but it is downtown Calgary which pretty much dies after 6pm.  Looking forward to coming back here for the food."}
{"text":"We wanted to stop for a quick bite and a beer, was a little disappointed in the staff service, the woman who waited on us wasn't very helpful in what to choose for beer or food. We ended up getting some Canadian beer and Nachos. The beer was really good but the nachos were a bit bland. I think this place has some potential but it seemed empty in service and quality. Not sure how people are giving 5 stars - probably the owners."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 beers and some nachos waiting for our car to be ready.   Nachos were a 6.5 out of 10. Beers were fine.   The BEST thing about it? PINBALL MACHINE. I can't stress enough how low on these this city is."}
{"text":"The upper deck used to be the place you went to for a wicked burger, but sadly now it's the place you walk by.   I was so disappointed by how much the food quality has declined. Not only was my order wrong, my boyfriends order was also incorrect. I remember you got nice steak cut fries, perfectly done, now you get skinny overly salted refried fries (or at least in my case they were refried). The burgers themselves were dry, slightly burnt and significantly smaller. The only remnants of the old burgers was the onion rings server on top.  I definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant is dirty, dingy, in a bad part of downtown and the service is subpar. To top that, the owner is o e of the biggest jerks in the entire city. Oh yeah, the food sucks too!"}
