{"text":"When you have to spit out your tofu because it tastes bad, you know you should never come back. Terrible pad Thai... Tasted like low quality Chinese spaghetti. Horrible Thai soup. I'm worried about tomorrow frankly."}
{"text":"We tried the ramen which was recommended on the window and it was a disaster. The tofu had a strange flavor and the vegetables weren't throughly cooked. I wonder why they would even post their ramen ad on the window..."}
{"text":"I hate to say it but the sushi here isn't fresh at all. And when I asked for something fresher, they even refused to make for me, worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"I don't usually go to Sushi Shop's, but I've tried pretty much everything at Galleries Du Parc and I really needed something new.   This sushi shop has a kids menu that comes with a drink, 7 rolls that you choose from a selection, a dessert banana and chocolate fried ball, and a choice of entree of a tempura shrimp or a nigri. And it's only 10$! I really enjoyed it because the choices were some of my favourites anyway so I wasn't compromising on what I wanted to eat like I do when I grab those pre-made boxes. On top of this I ordered some popcorn shrimp and they were so good!  The sushi was ok, a bit stiff, but sushi shop has their rice made in advance and refrigerated so that's why they taste the way they do. Which is ok certain days, I obviously didn't expect the highest of quality.  The service was fast and friendly which is good because sometimes other locations can be a bit rushed and the staff becomes very stressed.   Not a bad place to get sushi if you're working near by and you only have an hour for lunch. You can also order in advance by phone and pick it up."}
{"text":"J'ai pris un poké bowl volcano pour emporter. À mon goût il y avait un peu trop de laitue... mais c'était couvert des morceaux de saumon et c'était quand même bon. C'est sûr que tu ne peux pas t'attendre à une super super qualité, c'est un resto de genre fast-food. Aussi moins cher (12$) qu'un vrai resto de poké bowl :)"}
