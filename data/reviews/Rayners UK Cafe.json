{"text":"My dad and I visited for the first time today and we LOVED it! We split the Papa Rellenas, the Mexican Cuban Sandwich (I forgot the actual name), and the flan. It was all very good! It's little mom and pop kind of place, not much decor, and no restroom, but the food was completely worth it. Also our server was very friendly and made sure our drinks were always filled.   Highly recommend giving this place a try, we are excited to go back and try some other items."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places for coffee or tea. The homemade pastries, chocolates, and treats are scrumptious. It's small so seating may be short at the busy times, but if I had to I would just get my stuff to go. They have free wifi too!  Update: last time we were there we were still drinking our coffees (the expensive ones), and the waitress came over and told us she had people waiting for a table. So in other words \"leave\". My granddaughters were really embarrassed. We haven't bee"}
{"text":"This place is so cool!  1st trip in and they served up a proper tart with peach and blueberries topped with whipped cream - delicious!  Got an amazing bit of chocolate for being in there my first time - dark chocolate with vanilla bean and bourbon - amazing   If you're in the area, stop in.  Place is clean, has lots of treats (some packaged goods from the UK as well) and the  staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"I have gone to Rayner's at least a few times this month.  I love the breakfast sandwich on sourdough and 2 sausage patties with a cup of coffee.  Off the beaten path family owned. They have some pastries and chocolate.  The chocolate is excellent.  If your going to get someone chocolate, do mess around with the chain stores.  I also like the twice baked almond bar, not over powering, or stuffing, just enough to keep you wanting more."}
{"text":"So, I've been remiss in writing reviews, but since Yelp is all about community interaction and feedback, here goes. Rayner's is a delightful little coffee shop in an unassuming strip mall. The coffee and drinks are good, the food even better. But the desserts are the real treat, especially the handmade chocolates. The staff is friendly and solicitous, and the place has a very relaxed atmosphere. I've only been here three times so far, so a longer review will follow as I make my way through their menu and sample all their amazing sugary creations, but for the time being, you can't go wrong in stopping by and giving the place a try."}
{"text":"My Mom found this delightfully decadent cafe while visiting from out of town. It is a feast for the eyes(their array of chocolates and baked goods is phenomenal!) as well as the palate.  I highly recommend for a lovely cup of coffee and beautiful pastries and croissants."}
{"text":"The people working in the shop are very friendly and patient with people who can't make up their minds. We had lunch, all of our sandwiches were to die for, really good, really fresh. Will definitely be back for lunch! I took home some pastries and thought those were good as well. The only thing I did not like, and I was truly disappointed because I really wanted to love was the chocolate. I was hoping for really good truffles, the kind that are a real treat to get. These were ok, but not unlike something you could pick up at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible experience every time I come in here. Stopped in once between classes and got breakfast and coffee. Everything is amazingly fresh and exciting to try. Completely hooked from day 1. The owners and staff are incredibly courteous and quickly know you on sight. Porky's Panini is delicious and perfectly filling while the Azteca coffee, hot or cold, is an exciting change of pace from usual mochas. Cannot recommend this place enough and is currently my favorite alternative to chain-store coffee. Always try to stop in whenever I'm nearby."}
{"text":"Come visit this place!!!! Excellent service and great coffee and tea! And the little chocolate with your drink is an awesome touch"}
{"text":"Black Forest Ham & Egg Sandwich  Combined with Great Service is an excellent combo.... Also had a mocha and it was......Delicious ....."}
{"text":"Cute bakery/coffee shop hidden in a little plaza on 51st Ave off of Thunderbird Rd. Nice selection of unique baked goods, chocolates and coffee drinks. I loved the egg free breakfast cookie and my daughter highly recommends the chocolate and nut brownie. The owners work the register and the other is the chef, and are super friendly and clearly take pride in their establishment. I would have given them five stars in a heart beat (and I wish I could have given them four and a half stars) but they didn't offer skim milk as an option for the coffee drinks. Not a huge deal at all but it's what I like. Oh well, black coffee was just fine with me. A nice change up from the chain coffee shops."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite place to eat.  I am there at least 2X/week.  The food & staff are outstanding witk kudos to Chef Tony."}
{"text":"Good coffee always makes my day and when I think of good coffee I think of Rayner's Chocolate & Coffee Shop.  What mostly attracted me are the 10  delicious Latte combinations. The atmosphere is very welcoming and the staff there is great! You can even try a different sandwich, I ordered \"Best Grilled Cheese Ever\" and delicious.  A must visit Coffee Shop in Glendale!!"}
{"text":"Best chocolate we have ever had! We were surprised at their lunch variety and everything we have tried so far has been excellent. They have fast service to get you in and out on your lunch break. They also make custom chocolate for special occasions and are quite talented. We eat there once or twice a week now. The chef is from England  and has amazing British recipes in addition to American menu options."}
{"text":"This place is unique! I like to support local business owners and it's people like them that gives places like this a good name.  Their treats are delicate and you can't find most of these things at corporate bakeries. I come about 3x a month and I always find something I like."}
{"text":"We have been going here for 9 months. How many times have we visited in those 9 months? I am not proud of this, but I have lost track. When we move here, we wanted to explore what the Phoenix area had to offer in terms of food. The wonderful problem was that our favorite place was literally 2 minutes from our place. We have since moved, but Rayner's has not been replaced.   What is great about Rayner's? Everything. I am not stretching the truth. Their breakfast and lunch food are unique and outstanding. My wife loves their flavored coffee. I always get the China Mist Iced Tea.  Their pastries are too good, so it is hard to decide what to get. Do you like chocolate? If you do, this is also your place.  Finally, we love it because of the atmosphere.  Everyone that works there truly cares about the customers. You can tell this is more than a job for all of them.  If we were allowed to eat at one place in the world, this would be it.  Selfishly, I hated writing this review.  I love having OUR place, but such a place should be EVERYONE'S place.  Enjoy your time here. Try something new every time.  Just save us a table!"}
{"text":"Finally! An exceptional bakery and coffee shop in the West Valley! The place is fairly hidden, in a non-descript  strip mall on the east side of  51st Ave just north of Thunderbird but worth the effort. Their coffee is exceptional but my current fav is an iced Jujube fruit and black tea. I'm addicted. We're eating our way through their pastries; the croissants remind me of the ones I enjoyed in France. And their homemade chocolate-dipped biscotti  and Meringues (both Pistachio and Strawberry) are heavenly. There is a very particular German woman at work who gave very high marks to their Pear Financier Tarts (us too). And don't ignore their sandwiches and salads. They have a build-your-own sandwich for $5.25 that puts to shame the same sandwich with much lower quality ingredient at Sprouts for$ 2.99. And where else can you get handmade chocolate stilettos (for real)! We are delighted to finally have this level of quality in the bakery coffee and chocolate department on our side of town."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I recommend you try the fresh fruit cream cheese danish, it's soooo delish!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the West Valley. It is tucked away in a nearly vacant business area, but the food is something else. Run by a nice couple, the chocolate and pastries are handmade and the sandwiches are of the gourmet variety. They make a good cup of espresso too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic quality home cooked food! Great friendly service and a welcoming neighborhood environment!"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would. The lady working there was extremely rude towards me. I was there with my friend and the lady was very nice to her and gave her a free chocolate sample and asked her what she wanted to buy/eat. The lady completely ignored me knowing I was with my friend and didn't want to give me a free chocolate sample nor take my order. After taking my friend's order she walked away and got my friends order all ready and still didn't want to take my order. Obviously she had something against me, not sure what. I insisted and told her that I also wanted to purchase some chocolate and buy coffee. She looked angry and barely spoke to me. She was so miserable just ringing my order up but she was all smiles towards my friend. I should have just walked out and never bought anything."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Rayner's and again, everything was outstanding. The hubs got the Best Grilled Cheese (incredible) and I got a turkey/bacon/cukes/red onion and cream cheese sammie (so simple but so impressive).   And then there was dessert. Creme Brûlée bread pudding w/ whipped cream and raspberry sauce. I'm done. That's all I really need in life.   Oh and the service? Phenomenal. You can tell these lovely people love their business and it shows in the quality of food and service. We will be regulars.   Support local business!!!"}
{"text":"Great small hole in the wall for sandwiches and custom pastries. The owners are always there and very friendly. I recommend the Ham and Brie sandwich. So delicious."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great food and a very pleasant atmosphere, what else do you need? Staff here is very nice and friendly. Reasonable price. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Today was our second time at Rayner's. My husband ordered a spicy latte (I think it was Azteca) and it is delish, I wish I had one! We were asked if we were given free chocolates the first time we were there but we didn't. Apparently you get a free chocolate the first time you visit! My husband and I love the dark chocolates! Thank you!!!  A few months ago, around Halloween-ish, we went here after my son's basketball game and got a bunch of goodies and latte! We ordered a few chocolate eye balls and some pastries!  This place has amazing pastries (I forgot the names) chocolates and lattes! We haven't had the chance to try their breakfast and lunch menu but we will surely be back!  To top it all off, service is incomparable to anything! Everyone is so nice - even the other customers (seriously, we were greeted by a customer!)! We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing! As a teacher and a mom of an eight year old I seek workspace away from home. Here is a veritable slice of Britain with Wifi, great coffee/tea AND food. The chocolate is divine! The ambience is quirky. The staff is personable. I'm home!"}
{"text":"This is what yelp is all about; finding gems like these! The staff is amazingly nice, the coffee is delish and the chocolate is completely sinful. Kind of hidden north of a preschool off of 51st ave."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food, homemade chocolate everything is made with extra love and a warm environment."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite! Pat and her husband  \"Chef\" are AMAZING people. Everything is made from scratch off the menu. The almond joy coffee with a chocolate croissant is so good! Try the Greek chicken pita! It is delicious and filling. Everything is made with love and the atmosphere is relaxing!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I wanted to find a local coffee place to just sit at and we found this place. Absolutely tickled pink. The iced coffee is cold brewed and fantastic. Prices were great. My roommate got a butterscotch latte and she loves it. I am most definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Rayner's and the sandwiches were delicious, the chocolates divine and I know the twice baked almond croissant that I'm taking home to have with my English tea will taste like buttery goodness. Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch and was super excited to try it out based on the 5 star reviews... What I found was a 2 star restaurant. I would be shocked to find out if everything and/or anything was freshly prepared in house. I had a grilled chicken pita that tasted mediocre and my mom had a caesar salad which I swear is from Costco! If you are looking to spend 8+ on a meal that can easily be picked up from the pre made section of a grocery store then be my guest and give this place a shot."}
{"text":"It's with heavy heart I am giving them three stars. I really wanted this to be a regular stop for me, but sadly, I can drive past and not think twice.   The cafe is tucked away in a small strip center. The street signage is small and easily missed. The store front signage  is also lost; a \"coffee shop\" and \"bakery\" sign are affixed the roof line of the building and a white decal  of a crest and name adorn a window.  With a name containing the word \"chocolate\", one would expect to be walking into a room full of \"eye candy\". That's not the case here. Upon walking in , there's  a glass front case that contains about a dozen pasties and small tray of truffles and two small trays of batch nut coated chocolates. They also have a menu with breakfast and lunch items. In an adjoining room the have a small assortment of European grocery items for sale. ...So immediately, there's an identity crisis.   We were kindly greeted at the door by an older gentleman with a colorful sock. He asked if we would be dining in. We explained that we had a limited amount of time and if he thought we could be served promptly. The gentleman assured us we would be able to be served and eat with the time we had left.   We decided to get a latte and lunch. My lunch buddy and I ordered one of the latte that had mocha and marshmallow (forgot the name) it was ok, a bit too sweet for me.  For lunch we were going to each order an item and split; I ordered the Cornish pasty and she ordered the Cottswold Pie. Both came with a side salad. The pie and the pasty were insipid. The peas in the pasty were they only flavor. The Cottswold pie only had slight flavor of Cottswold cheese. We both ate our lunch pies, but as we sat there we quickly realized that we were going to be feeling our lunch for a while. It sat like a brick.   The gentleman was so sweet and concerned if we were going to be back on time. He also gave us a chocolate before we left.   The cafe is decorated in a granny fashion , classical music overhead and appears to be popular with many senior citizens. The average age while we were there must have been about 65. The establishment is clean and the service is exceptional. Unfortunately for me, the food was too bland to make me want to visit again."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in before going to the airport to go back to Kansas. The lunch specials were delicious and the coffee options were fun. Everyone made us feel like part of the family.  Found one of our \"go to\" locations for when we move here later this year."}
{"text":"Came in this morning for the breakfast burrito special and a breakfast sandwich can I just say they were amazing amazing amazing  !!!! We also had two iced lattes bomb.com !!! I should have ordered two burritos :( it was just soooo tastey. Service was great friendly, warm, and inviting and we also got to taste a chocolate I'd give this place 10 million stars if I could"}
{"text":"Just wow!  Stopped in this morning with my wife for breakfast on a whim and we will be back.  Wife had the breakfast tart and i had \"The Emily\".  Both were fantastic!  Service was great too.  We were greeted and served by a very friendly and professional young woman whose name i regret not getting.  Since it was our first time in we got a free chocolate.  The chocolates were perfectly balanced in flavor and artfully presented.  Of course we bought more.  As an added bonus, everything was very reasonably priced.  I would recommend this little gem to anyone without reservation."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place with fantastic service! I came here for lunch last week and was impressed. The service was fantastic and the woman who helped us was kind, especially since I was eating with an adorable and animated 2 year old. I had the chicken salad on a croissant. Wow! Delicious! We were offered some chocolates to try, which were delicious. We also bought a number of pastries which were all good. I would definitely eat here again. My only suggestion is to not come in here in a rush. I don't feel like we waited too long, but if you are expecting \"fast\" food then you may want to call it in or just expect a few minutes of a wait. It is worth it!"}
{"text":"Got the free chocolate-YUM. Lunch was good. Staff was pleasant. Just don't understand while it was 90 minutes between being seated for lunch and being served????? Granted, party of 7 takes a little extra work, but 90 minutes?"}
{"text":"Such a neighborhood gem!  The employees go above and beyond to be friendly and engaging.  They offer samples of their delicious chocolates for first time guests.  The coffee menu is outstanding and the drinks are consistently great.  I would highly recommend supporting this local business."}
{"text":"I'm shocked there is not a line out the door!  What a gem on the West Side!!  Awesome pastries and chocolates with delicious whole foods baked in.  The Coffee Jolt cookie was incredible with spicy dark tones.  The short bread full of buttery goodness like it should be. Now  the surprise...The coffee - WONDERFUL! It even impressed me; the greatest coffee snob of all.  I cant wait to try their lunches.  Hurry in before everyone else finds out and you can't get a seat in this perfectly decorated cozy little shop. Look for the yellow sign north of T-bird on 51st Ave."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem.   The food was delicious, the owners were so incredibly kind and friendly.  Thanks for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Love this family-owned place for breakfast and lunch. Food is excellent and the coffee is delicious ( my fiancé and I are coffee snobs and love the stuff they make here). But the chocolate is the best part. They use imported chocolate, not the cheap American Hershey's chocolate (but again, I'm a chocolate snob too).  I think if I were blindfolded, I could just pick a chocolate and I would be delightfully in heaven. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Tried this quaint little place for the first time today with the highest of hopes and was not let down. I went mid-morning to get a cup of coffee and something to eat. The lady behind the counter was very gracious and let me sample a piece of dark chocolate with an espresso cream filling. It was exquisite. I then bought a cappuccino wet and a muffin which I believe was cinnamon streusel. Hands the best cappuccino I've ever had and the muffin was so moist and the streusel added the perfect amount of richness and flavor. Excited to try they're large variety of coffees and teas as well as they're breakfast dishes and pastries."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries, British delights galore, and very reasonable prices! The chef has apparently been at it for 50 years and it shows. I'm so glad to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee place!! The service is friendly. The food is delicious. I've been here a few time and I've never had a bad experience. I would definitely recommend it if you are in the area. The breakfast and the lunch are fantastic!! I haven't tried the chocolate yet but I have heard good things!!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is good!!! The people are super duper nice and it's very cozy inside. So many options to choose from, I got the Irish-cinn hot coffee with hazelnut milk...unbelievably yummy...and the bacon nut. I don't know who thought of adding almonds to a breakfast sandwich, but that person is a food GENIUS! I'm not familiar with the roll that the bacon & egg sandwich comes on, but I'm pretty sure it literally melted in my mouth. U.K. flare with worldly goodies for purchase AND...AND!!! Homemade pastries and chocolates. WHAT!?!?!!? I can't believe we've never been here before. Fortunately for us, we were spotted as newcomers and were welcomed with a tasty chocolate piece of heaven. Please please please try this place out and you'll understand that I'm not just a crazy person yammering on about a coffee shop. I just heard the waitress sincerely say to a customer at another table \"as long as you're happy \". Great customer service, great food, great unique treats, great coffee.  BOMB.COM"}
{"text":"A few months ago, I was driving to my cousin's house and just happened to catch a glimpse at a sign that had the word \"chocolate\" in it. I decided to stop by with my fiancé, and I am so glad I did!  This gem of a bakery is tucked away just off of 51st Avenue and Thunderbird. They recently added more seating and it is surprisingly spacious. The owners are very kind, and I always receive great customer service when I'm there (which is a lot!).  Now, here are some of the things that I absolutely recommend:  Pain au chocolat Jujube anything - their tea is a little on the sweet side, but delicious All the handmade chocolates!!! (You get a free piece on your first visit!) Strawberry muffin Meringue Fresh fruit danishes Snickerdoodles - best I've ever had Brownies - very rich and chocolaty  Just try all that you can because everything is great!  The lunches are also a great value; it beats going to any fast food restaurant around town. I love the Greek chicken pita! Generous portions and fresh ingredients. My fiancé likes the Shepherd's pie, and I like to steal bites, too!  This is definitely a place worth visiting. I just moved to Los Angeles and am missing it dearly.  Charming, quaint places like Rayner's remind me how important it is to support small, local businesses."}
{"text":"A hidden gem we stumbled upon on our way out if town. We were just visiting family for the holiday and needed a quick \"treat\" for the road. Boy were we in for a TREAT! Handmade pastries and chocolates!! We ended up buying way more than we expected because everything looked and WAS so delicious. The owner helped us by explaining each different chocolate and even gave us a free taste (TIP: if its your first time they give you a free sample:) it was a little slow but that was only because they spent so much time and attention on us, which is a huge plus in comparison to all those big busy coffee shops that rush you through. Needless to say it was difficult to leave but alas California was calling us...but we at least had some delicious treats for our trip home!"}
{"text":"Sweet, little coffee shop!  I was looking for a local coffee shop in the area and had to try it when I saw the nice reviews.  I was not disappointed.  The iced dark chocolate mocha is delicious and was a lovely compliment to the croissant & cookies that I just had to try.  I'm looking forward to lovely Sunday mornings with my new favorite coffee!"}
{"text":"I have been desperate for a local coffee shop in the area, and I wish I had found Rayner's sooner! Great coffee and breakfast sandwiches, free wifi, and fun mom and pop atmosphere. The staff was incredibly nice, and I loved the local art on display. I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I love this little coffee shop! I came one morning and it is an amazing little shop hidden in the wall. Loved the hot mocha latte and the owner gave us each a fresh truffle for being first time guests! Delicious and it just melts in your mouth. It is also nice that the small dinning area is a little separated from the main shop because it made it a comfortable place to study for our nursing class. Great gem that's at least worth a try! :)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly cluttered little coffee place, the breakfast cookie was delicious with oats and dried fruit and the coffee was good enough to drink black. The employees were all so nice, I hung out for about an hour and nobody rushed us out, and actually offered refills. Make sure you tell them it's your first visit, they will give you a treat! They have a small shop with some cute imported British items including the cutest tea cozies!"}
{"text":"Actually still at this place. Promptly served and happy with the service. Very friendly people. I ordered a blackberry, lavender white mocha, iced. It was surprisingly delightful as I was not expecting fruit with coffee to be so nice.   It's a little pricey, but not more than you'd expect for freshly made goods. I'd definitely recommend coming here. I think I'm going to come back to try their lunch menu. It looks delicious. All the pastries look delicious. I bought 3 to take home and try. Also, free WIFI! Always a win for students. :)"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place. I came in for a simple cup of coffee and was quickly sold on their delicious lunches and chocolates, all for a very low price. The service is absolutely wonderful. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The hospitality is stupendous. The lattes and mochas my wife, daughter, and I had were creamy and smooth. While we waited for out drinks we were treated to hand crafted chocolates. When we are anywhere near ASU West we will definitely stop by."}
{"text":"I live in California but wanted to send something nice to a friend who had a rough time in Glendale, I wanted to send chocolates that were a very nice variety and higher end. When I called around and finally reached Rayner's the woman that answered the phone immediately answered all my questions and was very knowledgable about all the ingrediants used in each chocolate. The hotel will be picking up my order, but on product knowledge, quality ingrediants, and customer service alone I give them top marks. I hope when I see my friend she will share a chocolate or two so I can actually try these mouth watering creations!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff and owner!! Highly recommend, will def be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"Small, intimate family owned restaurant; food consistently good; great pastries and chocolate; on weekends, come early limited seating; friendly staff; first time customers get a free chocolate; love the Bacon Nut and Cornish Pasty. A must place to visit!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint little place, a true mom and pop shop!  It has VERY limited seating but we'll worth waiting for.  We were greeted by Eric who was our server and he gave us the back round of this great little place.  It has been here almost 5 years, the chef is from England and puts a European spin on a lot of the dishes.  They have quite the menu and they also have a separate menu with daily specials on it, if something catches your eye order off that, you may not get to again for some time!  That is exactly what I did I had the pork loin sandwich with pineapple salsa and it was Goooood!  My wife had what Eric called the \"Thanksgiving\" sandwich she enjoyed it but had to take some cranberries off it cause there were so many on there.  The prices are good and portions that you won't leave hungry, and the deserts are extraordinary as well are their lattes!  OH, forgot to tell you, they make homemade chocolate on site! MMMMMM!!!  Heading back for Sunday brunch to try the Monte Cristo sandwich!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! Ambiance is so inviting!! Highly recommend this little treasure!"}
{"text":"5 pasteries, 1 crumpet,2 sandwiches & 1 biscuits & gravy took over an hour & 1/2!  Owners wife was very pleasant & she gave us chocolate to make up for the slowness.  Food was fine, chocolate delicious, but slow service & plastic plates & cutlery make for a disappointing outing."}
{"text":"You couldn't pay me to write a bad review on this place. Absolutely wonderful. Stop in for breakfast, have some coffee, try some handmade chocolate, stay for some lunch and try some handmade chocolates. Chef is incredibly talented and his wife is incredibly pleasant. Wish I stopped in more than I do. Follow them on Facebook and get ready to drool over their daily specials. Do yourself a favor and try this place if you haven't."}
{"text":"It's a very cute shop! You also get a free piece of chocolate on your first time there! The coffee is excellent and my boyfriend loved his food! The food was not something I would personally get again bit the chocolate and coffee were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and this place was just what we were looking to find. I ordered the English Turkey Bacon Sandwich which was fresh and so tasty. Our server was welcoming and sweet. Love the mom and pop feel of this place. We were offered a chocolate treat as first time visitors. Can't wait to go back and take home the almond chocolate candy. Great casual stop."}
{"text":"We went in wanting to try a new coffee place, but this is so much more. The pastries are amazing, the service fantastic, and coffee well let's just say we will definitely be going back for the coffee, and possibly to try their lunch menu!  I wish I'd taken a couple pictures for you, but I was too busy enjoying the ambiance!"}
{"text":"Very cute little café, a little hard to find. The coffee was wonderful, my husband and I got sandwiches for lunch. He got a grown up grilled cheese more or less and I got a cranberry and turkey sandwich. They both were good but not great. The thing that would make me come back would have to be the chocolate. The lavender milk chocolate is amazing. Good thing coffee and chocolate go together."}
{"text":"Our friends introduced us to this lovely little quaint shop. They provided such great service, super friendly, have some excellent food, COFFEE, pastries & their chocolate is to die for! My little family will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, lunch, pastries, latte's, dessert and service. I had the monte cristo sandwich, grilled cheese, chocolate croissant, coconut latte and a couple of truffles. Don't judge me. So many options! Great service for our group as well. I will be back the next time I'm hungry in Glendale."}
{"text":"Coffee was mild and smooth, chocolate was also good. The Italian cookie was dry, but the other pastries were not bad. Went with a friend and she felt pressured to purchase chocolate... Personally, I felt that the staff was lovely and extremely friendly. If I were in the area I'd stop by for the coffee and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic bakery and sandwich shop this is the place!!..The food is very authentic and the bakery goods melt in my mouth. It quaint and the owners are so very personable...I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"My husband & I enjoyed a beautiful morning here. Great music & staff. While our coffee and smoothie were brilliantly prepared we browsed their imported products, chocolate shoes and pastries. Not too many environments like this around Glendale. You should go check it out."}
{"text":"Made my first visit about a month ago. I've been back almost once a week now. The coffee is delicious and the bacon nut sandwich is to die for.   What makes this place extra special is the people!   Raynor's feels homey and I love that they know their regulars, they talk to them like family. Do NOT forget to try and buy some chocolate."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. The food and desserts were delicious. Service was excellent. We were here to have a lunchtime tea party for my daughter's birthday. The staff was very kind!"}
{"text":"Cute little gem. A little pricey but SO worth it. Food is fresh and the staff is very welcoming. It's also a great place to come and study."}
{"text":"Really, truly a lovely little mom and pop place. The server was absolutely kind, helpful, and the food was excellent. I had the cornish pasty with side salad, and my husband had a great breakfast burrito. We received complimentary chocolates and I loved the goat cheese truffle, just freshly made. Great drinks, and we are looking forward to coming back with friends."}
{"text":"Tired of the same ol' coffee, we decided to see if yelp could help us and it brought us to Rayner's. I can tell you that it is a great little shop and the cappuccino (wet) was amazing actually the way it should taste. We had the 4b Black Forest ham and scramble egg sandwich and the 10b sausage bacon and scrambled egg. Bothe were delicious. I also tried and Italian love cookie (shortbread and jam) delicious. As first timers we were treated to a sample of the homemade chocolate ( dark, pumpkin seed). Everything was superb. This small business is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Homemade food at a home feel place. It was our first time and those that work there made us feel comfortable.....they give you your choice of chocolate sample because you are a first time customer. Delicious!! I ordered \"Eye Wonder\" dish and also ordered a chocolate filled croissant. Delicious!! They let us know that the dough they use for their croissants is imported from France. Either way.....so far all delicious!!"}
{"text":"A wonderful gem! Great for coffee, breakfast, lunch, pastries, and CHOCOLATE! A great local place on the west side!"}
{"text":"they use sunburst farms produce and products. everthing is fresh daily &absolutely delicous.  very hospitable and passion for there buiz. one of the unique things was, for  first time visitors you will receive a free mouthwatering chocolate."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. We loved our waiter and he was very attentive and accommodating to our time constraint.  The environment is definitely for an older crowd.  The latte was super sweet. We split the Cornish pasty and kortokold pie. It was served with a salad. The pies overall were pretty bland and heavy unfortunately. Wanted to like this place so much because of the service but unfortunately the heaviness of the food makes it less likely for my return."}
{"text":"Totally hidden, back alley little boutique coffee shop and English style cafe and bakery. The service is incredible, very personable and kind. We tried some of their chocolate which is absolutely fabulous. We have also been for breakfast, their biscuits and gravy are great, as is the \"I wonder\" egg dish they make with spinach. The place has wifi and is a very chill little place to sip on (very delicious and satisfying) coffee. They also sell what appears to be imported teas, jams, cookies and various perishable goods from the United Kingdom.   I would highly recommend this place for breakfast, brunch, lunch or just a good cup of joe!"}
{"text":"Homemade baked goods, artisan handmade chocolates and excellent coffee! Also, delicious breakfast and lunch! The west side finally has a locally owned place worth eating at!"}
{"text":"Just ate here with my father and the food was great. He had a breakfast tart which while good wasn't very big. He still loved it though! I had bacon, eggs and toast with a sliced tomato, the bread was hands down the best I've ever had. Also got a snickerdoodle to take home and I'm nibbling on it right now and it's also the best I've had! The lady who runs the place was super friendly and the atmosphere was open and welcoming, great hidden gem."}
{"text":"Everything here was great.  I went initially looking for something chocolate for my SO, so I got a triple chocolate mousse  (i didn't pay attention to the names) and a chocolate pyramid too. And noticed that they also had some fabulous sounding lattes and sandwiches,  so I ordered some for me,  both fantastic (i forget which iced  latte,  but I had ham sandwich with a raspberry spread ) .  While eating I felt bad not taking some pastries for my kids and dad,  so,  a couple of bear claws and chocolate croissants later, I finally left. Everyone at home loved everything I got,  and since my lunch was great too, I'm looking forward to another trip.  Maybe I can get there early enough to try breakfast,  which looked just as amazing"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum for my tum!!! I was instantly overwhelmed with the smell of fresh baked goods as soon as I opened the door! The young lady could tell it was my first time being there and she was so nice and helpful.  I ended up buying my than I intended but with my family it was a good plan!! I will be cooking back next week!! Yeeeeeaaaaah!! P.S. As a first time guest I got to try a free chocolate truffle :D it was like tasting heaven!!!! :)"}
{"text":"The food and customer service here is amazing. I come hete every other Wednesday and leave feeling happier than I arrived. The food is soooo good and they use fresh ingredients. The entire environment is very warm and inviting. I love Rayners"}
{"text":"Gorgeous shop.  Beautiful chocolates, pastries, muffins and coffee service too.  All items are made on premises by hand.  They do a daily lunch item for 6.95.  We tried the chocolates and the pastries.  They were packaged in pretty boxes so we could get them home without \"smashing\" them.  They have a couple of tables if you want to stay and eat in.  Check them out, we did and they are a rockstar of a shoppe!"}
{"text":"While Glendale does not have a shortage of cozy little cafes, this gem is a real must-try. Tucked in the middle of a small, quiet commercial complex near ASU West, Rayner's features delectable and unique chocolates such as goat-cheese truffles, and a selection of beverages and  tasty pastries and breakfast/lunch offerings. Fancy fare without fancy prices, served with the Rayners' friendliness and warmth that make this  cafe such a pleasant breakfast and lunch spot. Oh ... and free wi-fi, too, plus a small grocery for British items!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing! Ate the Brie cranberry ham sandwich for lunch today and plan on going back for breakfast tomorrow morning. You can tell the owners put so much thought and care into every dish. The west valley is lacking in unique delicious places like this. The location is not ideal but it is very close to ASU West. If you are looking for a little pick me up, the coffee is creative and fresh."}
{"text":"The weather outside today is perfect for coffee on the patio, and because I'm into supporting local businesses, especially coffee shops and restaurants, I thought I'd give Rayner's a try. Also, I love chocolate.  I'm glad I did. It's quaint, with limited seating. Since its just me and a friend this isn't a problem. There is a wall that sells a variety of British goodies like teas and cookies.  The menu included breakfast items as well as sandwiches and a case displaying yummy pastries. We tried the snickerdoodle cookie. Yum. My friend had a cold brewed iced coffee (a must try if you're inclined to iced). I had a butterscotch latte, substituted dark chocolate cuz I don't care for white. It's delicious."}
{"text":"Ok so I went to this place for breakfast with a friend. We shared a pastry which ended up being like a sandwich roll with a little frosting on top. Didn't like that at all. Then we both had sandwiches. I got the crunchy one with the bacon almonds egg and mayo on rye, it was nothing great. The only good thing was the black coffee. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Finally found a chocolatier in Phoenix. They make their chocolate on site everyday. A great selection of chocolates and don't be hesitant on the price of $2 a piece.... They are oh so good. For first timer, they offer free sample of chocolate so make sure to ask for one. Pastries are baked fresh everyday. My hubby had a sausage breakfast sandwich with customized bread and it was a winner! Service was first class-- no question, 5 stars! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was going to buy an item from the grocery section but I changed my mind and bought a bakery item instead. The owner took the cute black bag my original item was in back. She said she pays 1.97 for it so doesn't give it out with bakery items. Then I picked up a menu and she took it out of my hand and told me to take a different menu because that was the menu of the day and she only had a certain amount. It seemed like there were plenty. It seemed as if she was afraid that if she smiled the plaster may brake. So rude!"}
{"text":"This place is lots of fun great food too. Friendly staff. Most definitely will return"}
{"text":"Pleasant little cafe with some seriously delicious chocolates (made fresh in house.  Try the lavender-brandy dark chocolate truffles!  Nomnomnom).  We all enjoyed our breakfast sandwiches - the sausage was especially good."}
{"text":"Sitting in the parking lot at Wally-world on 59th & Bell, it's lunch time which means the Mexican Phone company (Taco Bell) or better yet, fire up Yelp and see what's in the neighborhood. Wait, what's this? A five star joint with over 40 reviews?  Hard to believe!  Well, believe it! Completly hidden on 51st between Greenway and TBird is a gem of a coffee/chocolate/sandwich/breakfast place.  Run by the owners and serving up incredible food and genuine service.  Had the Unforgettable Bacon Hot Dog with  secial sauce (red onion, jalepeno, swee icle, green olives, , etc.)  Wrapped in bacon on a perfect stadium bun and it was awesome.  The Princess had the grilled chicken with feta and tasiki (?) sauce- she can't wait to go back.  We've already made plans with friends to check out the breakfasts.  They also have homemade pastries and handmade chocolates which are the real deal!  (They generously give first-timers a free piece of chocolate). Judging by the steady stream of customers at 2:30 on a Saturday, I'd say the word is getting out on this wonderful place.  They also have a great selection of British grocery items for sale.  Check it out, you won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"First-timers get a free piece of mouth-watering chocolate!!!! So yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"After many years of talking about visiting Rayners we finally made it and I could not have been much more disappointed. The only thing really saving this review is the great service and the bomb Snickerdoodle cookie we got. We were greeted by a really nice lively young woman who got to us right away, crafted us some decent coffee's, and took our orders, what we got after that was what I feel a day's old meal from Jail might be like. Please see my pictures. Egg's were old, had zero taste, and were sponge like. The bacon was... well I don't even know if it was bacon. There was no fat, no juices, no sign of life to whatever piece of 5 day old jerky I was given. I will say the biscuits and gravy were pretty good. I believe that might be the only thing they made fresh that day. I don't know if they lady with the buzzed hair cut is usually the cook but she was the cook that day. I would like to come back and give this place another shot on the case that they were just having an off day."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE  They are so kind. They chocolate is Delicious.  Addicted to the Cinnamon Truffle...  Sandwiches are Amazing!  Enjoyed sitting outside, busy place during the week. Sunday was delightful...steady business for them.. made it a Peaceful place to eat."}
{"text":"A cute little coffee shop with lots of pastries. Ordered a cup of coffee that tasted great thanks to the recommendation from the cashier. The service was friendly. The only big downside I saw were the hours because I'm a student and was hoping to find a cute coffee place to study at."}
{"text":"This locally-owned coffee/chocolate/pastry/sandwich/soup shop is a wonderful little jewel tucked away with several businesses on the East side of 51st Avenue just north of Thunderbird. I was so lucky to run across it a month ago! I rushed over to welcome them, and found to my delight that not only was everything scrumptious, but the owners are kind, down-to-earth folks (who happen to be a killer chef and a chocolate wizardess) who are committed to sourcing their ingredients locally. My family and co-workers are slowly working our way through their offerings and absolutely everything is outstanding. I hope you get a chance to try Rayner's soon - you won't be sorry! BTW ASU students - they offer a Student Discount - sweet!"}
{"text":"We wanted to treat ourselves after running errands yesterday and decided Rayner's was just the way to do it!  I had the beef barley soup special, filling and hearty, and my husband had his usual, the beef sandwich with pear and goat cheese. They are always up to something new, so we sampled the Irish Bailey's truffles, in honor of St Patrick's Day. And of course we brought home a few pastries to enjoy the next day!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, I felt so warmly welcomed to this fantastic little place. The little market was a little piece of nostalgia for me and brought up many great memories from childhood. Definitely a splurge breakfast that was completely worth it. Now, on to my breakfast review:  1) Cinnamon bun latte, cappuccino style: the first words out of my mouth were \"this is the best cappuccino I've ever had\"  2) Crème brulé bread pudding: not typically a fan of bread pudding, this was the best. Eat the middle for that typical \"gooey bread pudding\" consistency. It's fantastic 3) Porky's Panini: NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART! If you're not scared to get a little messy and a lot of gravy everywhere, this sandwich is for you! I asked Pat if next time I could just have a loaf of sourdough and a bowl of gravy because that would just make my world complete.  4) Monte Cristo: your typical delicious Monte on sourdough. Really classic, really delicious.   Overall, wonderful place to sit and enjoy a quiet and quite fantastic meal in a place that feels like home. Plus the free truffle for first-timers will convince you that you should try them all."}
{"text":"Lady (I think owner?) working was friendly & the decor was very cute. They had a nice selection of pastries as well as an extensive list of different coffee drinks. I always try to frequent these little Mom & Pop kinda shops & this didn't necessarily disappoint but it wasn't the best I've ever been to. I ordered a raspberry danish & an iced coffee with salted caramel syrup.  It was just weak hot coffee poured over ice with maybe a tiny bit of the syrup. The pastry was great but as far as coming back because I need my coffee fix, I'll probably keep looking. I do look forward to trying more of the pastries because there were quite a few & they all looked scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! Delicious food and excellent service! Tucked away but totally worth finding it! Stop in for breakfast or lunch. The baked goods are fresh and beautiful to look at. We will be back!"}
{"text":"A great find in Glendale. I'm especially a big fan of their pasties. I've been for brunch as well as lunch. Their chicken is probably a 7/10, but their beef cornish pasty is a solid 10/10 and probably what they're best known for. Their buscuits and gravy is loaded with hearty pieces of chunky meat that makes it so worth it.   They also have a very delectable selection of pastries and in-house made chocolate with a variety of additions such as orange, almonds, blueberries and caramel. Their chocolate is very good.   The staff here is very welcoming and happy to help in any way. It's a small cafe with limited seating and they do use plastic plates and silverware that makes it a little tacky but the food is the reason you came."}
{"text":"Adorable! I give it a 4/5 for the food, chocolates and service. Very \"Mom and Pop\" and quintessentially British. I only wish the location were better. This place deserves much more than a sketchy looking plaza where the seating is very limited and dated."}
{"text":"Love this place!! A little cafe and coffee shop with DELICIOUS lattes and baked goods! It was my first time here and I'll definitely go back! Since it's my first time, I asked them to surprise me with their favorite latte and sandwich. I was served The Poe, a dark chocolate, raspberry and rose latte, in a cute mug and the English Turkey Bacon sandwich. I'm IN LOVE with the latte and the turkey was thick cut (but not too thick) and delicious! They had chocolate filled croissants just out of the oven that I HAD to try. It made my day! It was puffy, flaky and buttery and everything I wanted in a croissant. Thanks for making it such an enjoyable experience! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing breakfast today.  I scarfed down the Welsh sandwich--it was scrumptious.  My wife had the breakfast burrito.  It was huge and I enjoyed the second half.  Our son had an authentic British crumpet with some awesome jam.  All that great food, spot-on coffee drinks, gorgeous baked goods and charming staff.  Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Ordered cobb salad, which did not even resemble a cobb salad.  It was actually a chef salad with ham, turkey, Swiss and cheddar cheese and egg.  No blue cheese, no bacon.  And it came with bottled dressing (blue cheese) that had no blue cheese chunks.  The rating would move up a star if they called it a chef salad, and I had ordered a chef salad!  And please, provide better quality dressing!"}
{"text":"Rayner's first came on my radar a couple of years ago thanks to mentions by friends.  I've become a real fan once I tried it.  It's hard to decide my favorite food offering there:  pastries?  handmade chocolates? Delicious lattes?  Outstanding soups? Tasty sandwiches?   I must face it, I love them all!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a new place to have coffee.  We found this bakery at a central location and decided to try it out.  I ordered the bacon & egg sandwich and a mocha latte and both were very good.  We also received a free piece of their homemade chocolate for being first time guest!  Overall our experience their was very pleasant...no complaints.  Before leaving I ordered a snicker doodle cookie to go.....it was delicious.  I would definitely return and try their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"A great place to get pastries, chocolates or a nice breakfast/lunch. A nice diamond in the rough if you like amazing food you really should come stop by this place! It's only open until December and then the gem will be gone so treat yourself while you have a chance! If you're curious just take a look at the pictures or give their Facebook page a visit! Don't forget to get some coffee while you're here their baristas are quite good at what they do.  Definitely one of my favorite places to grab a bite with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This cute little shop never fails to amaze me. Their Arizona Delight latte is quite the miracle in a cup! Their food is amazing, their chocolate is to die for and they're all around one of my favorites! So glad I came across this place and added it to my new weekly addiction!"}
{"text":"Crumpets were so light and fluffy. Amazing! Latte was just right sweetness. We will definitely be adding this to our places to visit often. Plus....bonus.....they are veteran friendly."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write a review about this place because I want to keep it our neighborhood's best kept secret. They were recommended to me by my cousin who had been a couple times. They have obvious Scottish and Irish influence and this is a big draw for my family. I decided to try them out for lunch, ordered an iced chai latte and the ham and brie croissant sandwich special. Holy. Balls. The best chai I've ever had (and they'll make it dirty if you like), and I was honestly sad when the sandwich was gone. The owner and chocolatier was so friendly and offered me a free chocolate since it was my first time. She brought me the cinnamon rum milk chocolate. I don't typically like cinnamon chocolate but this was exceptional. I'll probably pick up a few of these specifically next time I go back. The other woman who came in had a lavender dark chocolate, which sounds delicious.   I also like that you can tell how fresh and homemade everything is, and they're not skimpy with the sandwich fillings. My sandwich was loaded with thick cut black forest ham and big hunks of brie. I also lime that they mayo both sides of the sandwich, it's the little things that count. I don't typically like ham either but this was well worth the gamble! I'm sooo soo sooo looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Today's roast beef and pastrami French Dip special was topped only by the peach cobbler dessert special served hot in its own baking dish.  A perfect dessert to share."}
{"text":"In honor of local business and my love of  a good pastry shop , here is the info on No Phoenix's newest delight.   Cute and thoughtful decorated with a glass window to watch chocolates being made this is a special place.   Yahoo and Hurray ! I am thrilled to have a bakery that is tasty , homey and has great lunch tarts, salads,sandwiches and coffee!  Located near ASU west just north of Thunderbird , this quaint mom and pop bakery has the elements of a being a local haunt. Owners Pat and Tony Rayner have loads of chocolateriering and  baking experience and their display case shows it. Filled with tasty cookie bars, filled chocolates ( chocolate with goat cheese ? Yes please! ), pain au chocolate, big cookies and tarts .This is like a great back east bakery , And  the goodies are fresh and taste like the way you'd make it if you could . Did I mention they also have one of my downfalls  chocolate covered macaroons? It's so yummy! Prices are reasonable ,and the macarons are only a buck!   Now if that weren't enough they also have sandwiches and tarts that seemed European , maybe because Tony is was formerly a British baker? Lunch time treat ? Try the one of the salads with goat cheese and walnuts....mmmm.  Food can be take out or stop and eat at their sweet little tables.   Looks like they are well equipped for coffees, smoothies and other breakfast nicieties too.  Close to my work it  may become my new favorite."}
{"text":"If you like Belgium Style Chocolates, Fresh Baked Pastries, coffees, teas, smoothies breakfast or lunch this place might be for you! This friendly but very small place also sells some hard to find British dry goods. Some of the breakfast and lunch specialties are, English Style breakfast,  Cornish Pasty and Cotswold Pie.   We shared two of the lunches. The pasty had a very tender crust and was filled with tasty ground beef and vegetables. This meal came with a very large fresh regular salad.   The sandwich named, \"Best Grilled Cheese Ever\" Turned out to be the best tasting Vegetable with cheese sandwich I ever had! This sandwich was more vegetables than cheese but was on  tasty, nicely toasted white rye bread. This sandwich also was made with tasty sauces that just made it delicious.  Had to share a dessert so I picked the double baked almond croissant because I never seen a dessert like that before. It was made of many light layers of pastry, stuffed with an almond cream and topped with more decadence,  It was a very rich dessert but was masterfully made.  As we were leaving the server INSISTED we try a chocolate since we never were here before. I picked the milk chocolate with macadamia nuts. The chocolate was very creamy and delicious and so smooth. I won't be able to eat store bought chocolates now after Rayner's Chocolate.  What a Treat!  You should Check Rayner's out if you can!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this cafe! I workout at the gym next door & often stop in for coffee & a healthy pita sandwich. I was sad to hear the original owners were selling the business to retire. However, I was happy to find when I stopped in today that the new owner was behind the counter to greet me. She was warm & welcoming much like Pat the original owner. I think change is a good thing even when it means saying good bye to something familiar. I'm eager to see how the new owner brings her own touches all while continuing to run the Rayner's we know & love. I'm all for supporting women in business & I will continue to support this great cafe just as I did with the previous owners. No it won't be exactly the same as it was before & you know what, that's ok. People need to give change a chance"}
{"text":"Try their breakfast cookie. It is the best butter laden oatmeal based concoction I have ever tasted. Coffee was very good also."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what was going on there today. We waited one hour and 15 min for a grilled cheese which I never received because when I asked about it they still were not working on it. We also ordered two drinks a chia tea latte & a butterscotch latte. This took 20 minutes to get. And to my surprise my ice tea latte had butterscotch in it. There appeared to be enough employees to run the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop hidden away in Glendale. The service is always excellent and the food is good. I enjoy the coffee and desserts as well. They are a bit pricey but, that's normally the case with small local businesses."}
{"text":"Very friendly owners! I went here for coffee, but they sold me on everything! Delicious and creative chocolate, amazing pastries, and tons of love put into the place"}
{"text":"Short: good coffee, delicious pastries, good lunch, not a fan of the breakfast items, great people. I would come here for coffee and pastries.  Long: Over the winter my boyfriend and I came here for about five days in a row since it is in walking distance of our house. I love the coffee and their pastries. I have had the toffee mocha three times. It is chocolatey without being cloyingly sweet (in comparison to Starbucks). The owners are so nice and friendly. You feel like you are in their kitchen. We have had some food we liked and some we didn't. The Irish stew is good along with the Caesar salad and the pasties. All of the pastries are perfect. I did not really enjoy the porkys panini. Too salty and not enough balance of flavors. It also gave me heartburn for a week. The bacon nut was just a little too strange for me. Not gross, but would not get again. Bacon and slivered almonds on an egg sandwich?! We were not a fan of the breakfast sandwiches in general (most served on hamburger buns with mayo). On food alone, I would have rated 3 stars but the customer service and friendly people earn another star from me!"}
{"text":"I searched coffee and found this gem. What a delightful little shop. Fresh homemade chocolates, fresh everything. I was so pleased with everything. The prices are more than reasonable. The owners are present, they actually work there. Very pleasant folks! I highly recommend Rayner's."}
{"text":"Still love this place! Always a pleasure. Today my wife and I enjoyed breakfast there (served all day on Sunday -til 11 on Tues - Sat). First we enjoyed a delicious cappuccino and latte. Then, for our meals my wife had the Emily (eggs, capers and spinach on a telera roll), and I went the opposite (aka meaty) direction and ordered Porky's panini (pork patties and bacon smothered in the \"biscuits and gravy\" gravy  put between delicious bread and then placed in a panini press). We enjoyed both items.   We were both full and happy after that. But, you can't leave Rayner's without a truffle or pastry. We each sampled the goat cheese and dates dark chocolate truffle and the fresh plum puff. The truffle was creamy chocolate, decadent, deliciousness and the puff was light, flaky, and fruity.   This is a gem in the fabric of the west valley. Don't pass it by."}
{"text":"This place is badass it has a lot of yummy yummy authentic sandwiches and breakfast and especially awesome stuff from the bakery.....you have to go check it out!!"}
{"text":"The strip mall in which it's located is nondescript so pay attention, but if you are near ASU West or Thunderbird, make a pit stop! The latte was sufficient - not the best press I've had but definitely not the worst - but the savory and sweet treats are what sold me. The service was sweet, helpful, and graciously warm! The feeling was just happy and homey. The pastries rival what I tasted in Europe, and my savory biscuit breakfast sandwich tempted me to order a second (which would have triply killed my diet). I was delighted to see they sell truly Briton fares, and I not only have some PT's tips, I also have a new box of Builder's tea to cut my teeth on Monday through Friday to save myself from sad corporate coffee. Builder's is not a pansy tea, no way, this is the stuff of the makings of that enviable strong, upper lip of the quintessential Brit that we Americans somehow lost in our independence. As far as tea goes God Save the Queen, and as far as pastry and coffee goes, long live Rayner's."}
{"text":"I understand that I am in the minority here with my strongly negative review of Reynor's,  but I will persist. I patronize this place when it first opened; for a while, it seemed that I was her only customer. It has since become extremely successful and popular. However their food offerings, while very good, are markedly overpriced. The products that they sell that are British imports are even more overpriced. They are also extremely haughty. Example:  their walls are adorned with original artwork by local painters. Pat, the front manager and her husband chef Tony, take 25% of each of the prices marked on those paintings for the privilege of showing them to patrons. This ought to be an affront to the sincere artists who create these artworks. In other words, the place has become a money pit. I urge you not to patronize this place simply in order to make yourself feel important. It's a disgrace. By the way, I am retired ASU faculty. I hold three Masters degrees and a doctorate. I'm not a fool. My assessment above his reasoned.  there are plenty of other striving, family - owned establishments in our community who will treat you graciously and satisfy your taste buds and you deserve your patronage. This one does not."}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind. I've tried nearly everything on the menu and have never had a bad experience. In fact everything I try has only turned out to be excellent. From breakfast, lunch, dessert, coffee, and their other drinks everything is delicious and satisfying -- and all for incredibly low prices. The owners are extremely friendly and interesting people who are more than willing to have a great conversation. I can't think of a better place for lunch anywhere -- let alone Phoenix. This place is truly a treasure."}
{"text":"Stopped by today after driving by and being curious about stopping in. Today is Friday , hours stated 7 am- 4pm but unfortunately there was nobody in sight and store was closed. Hope all is well with staff/owners ."}
{"text":"Under new ownership. The food was good, but slightly off and the service was definitely not as friendly at first, until I started talking to our server and asking questions. Unfortunately the chocolates are no more. I am hoping they will improve as they get some more experience."}
{"text":"So I wish we had a place like this in Atlanta. They gave us some samples that I loved. But we really just stopped to get some caffeine. So I got a Pecan Latte and Chris got a Mocha Latte?   But as luck would have it, I just had to see an Almond Croissant in the distance and had to have one too. Which led Chris to grabbing a sandwich. And then we were on our way. We will be back when time permits."}
{"text":"Okay, so tried some more things.  Breakfast items are now restricted by time (to 11am) so get here early!  Chorizo and egg burrito is becoming a fast favorite! A bit messy but so good. It is ground chorizo in a flavorful sauce with peppers and sour cream.   One of the best, if not the best, clam chowders I've ever had. You get bites of flavorful clams in every bite.   The lunch item I tried was the Greek chicken pita sandwich. I ordered when I came too late for breakfast and it's so much more than I expected. Tender chicken with spinach and a generous layer of yummy spread in a thick pita. Normally I don't like red onion but it works great. I should have saved half for later because after eating it, I fell in a food coma.   A while back I had another sandwich that I didn't like only because the cream cheese was thick and cold.I think I prefer the hot/warm sandwiches so it's up to preferences.  I wish I got some pictures but I ate it too quickly."}
{"text":"Great little shop and restaurant with a wonderful little bakery and candy goodies.  There are several tables for small groups of people and yummy lunch choices."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Definitely somewhere worth a visit!  Their espresso drinks are fantastic and the lunch options are diverse and tasty. Plus, every first-time customer gets a free piece of chocolate ;-)"}
{"text":"I came in to Raynors to buy a Christmas gift for a co worker who gave me nothing more then \"chocolate and purple\" as an idea for a gift.   I was warmly greeted and promptly directed to the choco-engineer. She was a young girl with a serious passion for chocolate and art. She is an artist. I explained what i needed and she was more then happy to assist. I even got a sample. yeah buddy.   The cafe is small, clean and a place i will be sure to try for some lunch."}
{"text":"This place warms my heart. I was greeted with pleasant smiles and friendly service. It's a cute place that is British-themed with a moderate amount of seating. I could definitely see myself studying here as free wifi is provided, and I'd have continual access to coffee and pastries.   They have a variety of lattes hot/iced for $4.25. The quantity was about a grande at Starbucks. I had an iced hazelnut mocha, which was not the best I've ever had yet fairly decent as a whole. We tried their Rayner's Bacon Dog on the lunch special menu. It was delicious. The bun was not your typical hotdog bun, more like a toasted baguette; the bacon was crispy. They had just the right amount of sauerkraut.   The best part was getting free handmade chocolate since it was our first time. We got dark chocolate with hazelnut and macadamia nut. The chocolate had this bitter salty taste that goes very well with the nuts we chose."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Visiting from out of state. Came in and the owner was very friendly and welcoming, she gave us a sample of chocolate and it was one of the best pieces of dark chocolate I've ever had! I had oatmeal and coffee for breakfast, their black drip coffee is really great too. Lots of great selection and chocolate, and lots of imported British treats too. I will definitely come back here again when I'm in the area. Great customer service. It was a pleasure eating here."}
{"text":"My new favorite bakery in town! I found this corner in the wall place on yelp and the reviews didn't lie! I was very impressed by the delicious and unique quiche \"ham and cheese and egg tart\", frappe dark chocolate coffee, and pastry! I also enjoy the personable service and free chocolate as a first time customer...dark chocolate macadamia nut..mmm...I was back 3 days later to show it off to a friend who was in town! Great place for a pick me up, decadent treat, breakfast, or to enjoy time with a friend.   Also serves lunch menu and has unique hard to find cultural foods for sale! Hard to keep me away!"}
{"text":"I adore this family owned coffee shop! The food is amazing, chocolate is the best and you will leave wanting to plan your next visit!"}
{"text":"Vanilla bean whisky chocolate truffle was really good. The lovely staff member told us about first time guests and how they get a complimentary chocolate. It's amazing chocolate! I came in with my sister merely for the coffee and heard about this place on Yelp. It's amazing. Coffee selection is incredible. Fun neat drink selections. I had the Arizona delight not too sweet just enough coffee taste. It's wonderful. Also my sister had turtle mocha and she really liked it. I had an Italian puff pastry that was really good. I'm happy I came!  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit and my expectations were beyond exceeded! The food was flavorful and delicious the tea was the perfect temperature and so tasty. The staff is kind and friendly and seems to really care about their customers and each other. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a while on several friends recommendations  but it never seemed to fit my schedule. Then for Christmas I got a gift certificate so I really had to get here. Went for lunch on a weekday. Had a special sandwich that was sort of like a corned beef and cabbage meal on a roll. It was ok. The lemonade was a good take on that. I managed to steer clear of the bakery case. I would give this a 3-1/2 but the folks are so friendly I had to round up instead of down."}
{"text":"Under new management but still a great menu! This iced drink was delicious! Lots of lavender infused pastries & drinks! Awesome!"}
{"text":"What a great little place tucked away on 51st Aveue/Tbird.  Along with great coffee, sweet treats, who knew they had the best biscuits & gravy?  We did!"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite little places. Absolutely lovely, and the owner always remembers me, even if I don't visit as often as I'd like."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for weekend brunch. Everyone is so nice and the bakery always has new delicious new desserts. Eric is super nice and makes you feel welcome! Lunch and breakfast only"}
{"text":"Everything is made in house. From the creme brûlée bread pudding to the sour dough bread for paninis.  Pat, the owner, is the sweetest most gracious host. She gave us a couple of free (house made) jalapeño chocolate truffles to start. Breakfast and the coffee were pure perfection. Nothing negative to say about this place except it's far from us. Of course with all the great pastries, that is probably a good thing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Several options for sugar free coffee's. We had the monte cristo and biscuits and gravy. Friendly staff and free WiFi! We highly recommend this cafe."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area waiting on a friend and needing to kill time so i found this shop on yelp. The shop is located in what appears more like office buildings so i was not sure what to expect. As i walked in i found a quaint shop filled with treats and friendly faces behind the counter.  I loved the cappucino, breakfast cookie and truffle i had while i read for a bit. They also have lunch and sell items on the far wall of the store including England mugs. I loved everything so much i cant wait to take my family with me again later this week."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best pastries ever. Friendly staff. Everyone is family here.  Mom and pop joint, super comfy and cozy atmosphere. Yay Rayners!"}
{"text":"Well, where do I begin? We had visited before and received a free piece of chocolate for first timers. The chocolate was smooth and delightful. We promised to return for lunch one day. Well, Saturday was that day. We arrived and found the restaurant to be half full and rather quiet. We were asked by the clerk if we wanted to take out or dine in. We decided to eat there and sat at a table near the window.  Let me say this before anything else. The smells from this place are fantastic. Fresh baked sweets, rolls, pies, soups.....wow. Utopia for your nose. We ordered a few coffee iced drinks and our main dishes. I had the Cornish patsie (beef pie) and the wife had a turkey sandwich with bacon and no mayo. Here's where it went south a bit. The turkey sandwich, while perfectly prepared, was rather flavorless. The lack of mayo made it necessary to find other condiments to liven up the sandwich. While the sandwich was OK...my patsie was delicious. The beef was flavorful and the salad had fresh, crisp veggies. The iced coffee drinks were probably the biggest disappointments. The syrups added presented a \"fake\" taste that ruined the beverage quality overall. My wife ordered a second beverage in exchange for the first and after a quick apology by the clerk we had a new drink on the way with no hassle. Great customer service! The desserts were our second conquest. Let's just say that after ordering the bread pudding I took some to go after I checked out. Lol. It was a spiced cake style of bread pudding. Very tasty. Overall, 2 drinks, 2 main dishes, 3 desserts and great service was about 35 bucks. I will be frequenting this place in the future.  As for the hiccups, don't forget that you don't need to bat 1,000 to make the All Star Game."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough! This tiny jewel is not easily visible from the road but worth the hunt! I ordered lunch and took home a little of everything from the bakery. Let me tell you....ALL of it was amazing. The pastry around the Cornish was fresh, baked perfectly and the flavors of the stuffing worked perfectly together. The pecan shortbread cookies and the passion fruit lemon cupcake were a delight to my sweet tooth. I would recommend anyone to stop by this little café!"}
{"text":"This place is an adorable, hole in the wall coffee shop. The staff is friendly and the food is good. But the coffee is amazing! So many choices, I may never get to them all. But I will certainly try!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I've been gunning for an independent coffee shop in the neighborhood (lived down the street my whole life) and I hate going to that Starbucks on 43rd!  This place was lovely, inviting, delicious and the welcoming. The chocolates are to die for and the iced tea was strong and actually tasted like tea.  So happy they are here - I am telling everyone I know to stop by!"}
{"text":"Wow, I never would of known this place existed if I didn't see it on Yelp. As a first timer, they offered us a piece of chocolate, and I tried the milk chocolate coconut one. The chocolate was soooo good!   I got the black forest ham & egg sandwich, and it came out in a hamburger bun. It was really good, but nothing I fell head over heels for. My boyfriend got a lunch combo, which came with sun chips or fruit. The lady suggested we upgrade for some other kind of chips for $1 more...the chips were good, but definitely not worth the $1 upgrade.  The prices were really good too. My breakfast sandwich was around $4 and the lunch combo was around $8.   I do want to go back sometime and try their pastries because they look SO good!"}
{"text":"This is a more unique local business that serves chocolate, European (mostly British) styles foods, and British grocery items.  They have a full menu of breakfast and lunch items but I ordered one of the Scotch egg pasties out of the display cooler along with a lemon bar and Highland shortbread. That, with a large latte, was just over $12.   The pasty was pre-made and warmed in the oven so it came out fast and was so good. Very soft, perfectly baked pastry crust with a sprinkling of pepper and salt on top. The Scotch egg inside (hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage) was delicious. The sausage was perfect and not at all greasy and the egg was cooked just right. The lemon bar was more of a type of lemon curd oat cake instead of just being the typical lemon-y gel stuff over graham cracker crust and was really good. I like that it was more hearty than your average lemon tart. The shortbread was a little harder than I like but has nutmeg and cinnamon in it and was great when I dipped it in a hot coffee I made myself later. The latte was great too. It wasn't anything special but wasn't too milky and the coffee wasn't bitter which is all too common in less-commercial coffee places. Just right.  You can see right into the chocolate-making area and there were a bunch of different types including these huge high heels made of chocolate. Really cool! I, unfortunately, didn't actually sample any of their chocolate but I'll be back for that sometime hopefully soon.  As I was in and eating, two different people came in and were obviously regular how they chatted with the owners. It was nice to have that real mom-and-pop-shop feeling there.  I definitely hope this place sticks around! I don't frequent this area of town but if I lived over there, I'd certainly be a regular."}
{"text":"Wonderful little spot, so glad we found it, fanstastic turkey and cranberry sandwich and pastries are delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this little place. There food is so fresh and delicious. I love there soups they change them every day and there Greek chicken pit is to die for. There coffee is amazing and you can't beat the prices. Also my son orders chocolate milk and it come with whipped cream and sprinkles he was so won over. Can't wait to try more things."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, local coffee and chocolate shop. I had the split strawberry horns, pistachio meringues, chocolate dipped almond biscotti, savory three cheese cheesecake with strawberry salad, two scrambled eggs with ham tomatoes, and toast and a chocolate croissant. I also tried an iced azteca coffee and cinnful Irish iced coffee Everything was good and tasted homemade. I will be back to try the chocolates."}
{"text":"It's a nice little shop with a variety of treats, meals and drinks. They don't limit themselves to just breakfast but serves lunch as well. The coffee was good, I had a biscotti and they were good as well. It has a nice homey feeling which I'm sure serves the student community wonderfully seeing as it is so near the university. Fully capable for one to sit and work, read or just indulge in the European delectables! The service was incredible and the shop is kept nice and clean which shows something for a food service facility. I would recommend it to those in the area!"}
{"text":"If you ever in Phoenix,Az come see this place! Patty is soooo sweet and hospitable, menu is small but delicious. Sweets are out of this world, 10 Latte combinations. Haven on Earth!"}
{"text":"The hummus, veggie, and focaccia bread sandwich is good. Perfect for a light lunch. I bought some of their pastries hoping that would make for good snacks/easy to grab breakfast options, but they were lack luster as best. I will definitely stop back to try their shepard's pie though."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. The coffee and food are delicious! The atmosphere is great, owners are nice, and the baked goods are perfect. Couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch today and the sandwich we had was really good.  Also, they carry China Mist tea which we both enjoy.  We tried a piece of dark chocolate with almonds and one with macadamia nuts.  Excellent.  The place is really clean, bright and cheerful.  We highly recommend this restaurant and the price is really good."}
{"text":"It's difficult for me to sum up my review of this charming little restaurant. But let me attempt it by saying this, if you're looking for a good selection of great coffee this is your place. If you're looking for a selection of both traditional and out of the ordinary fine chocolates and pastries, this is your place. If you're looking for popular British candies crackers and jams, this is your place. If you're looking for traditional British and American breakfast and lunch items, this is your place. I have been to numerous restaurants that were recommended by various restaurant finder phone apps. A good majority of them turned out to be a disappointment. This one was not a disappointment, and in fact turned out to be one of the better places that I have found through a restaurant finder phone app."}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop chocolate shop. Yummy food for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Your first time here you get a piece of chocolate to try...they make it right in the back of the shop. Amazing food...wonderful treatment...so happy."}
{"text":"A MUST go! Awesome customer service. Lattes out of this world!  Best latte menu I've ever seen! Eric was so friendly, we got complimentary choclate! They even have almond milk,  score!!!"}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem. Love their coffee and pastries...and the chocolates are Amazing! We got to sample one because it was our first time. The owner and staff were lovely, we'll be back for some breakfast or lunch next time."}
{"text":"Delicious chocolate!!! Did try a sandwich a cream cheese turkey with cranberry... it was definitely unique... maybe a little much for my taste, it wasn't bad just not my thing. My mother had a sandwich with brie and Dijon mustard she loved it! I have yet to try the coffee maybe tomorrow for breakfast : -)"}
{"text":"The reviews are all true. This place is simply amazing. Food is delicious and inexpensive. The owners are so upbeat and friendly; you can tell they love their store and their customers. Calling all Canadians!!! Check this place out when your in the area. Many familiar chocolate bars and food items we grew up with in Canada."}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  I wanted to hate it at first because the employes seemed kinda of flighty.  However they were so kind and willing to help once I was next in line.  The have all kinds of chocolate truffles and some unique chocolate shoes?  It's strange, I had order some pastries and some tea.  The price was reasonable and I got free chocolate!!!  I looked to see some of the other patrons eating food, and well I'm still on the fence about that.  They looked happy eating it but I'll have too see for myself someday.  my only complaint is this place is hard to find and easy to miss, USE GOOGLE MAPS!"}
{"text":"We had a group meet at Rayners today for breakfast and I can honestly say that I have never had a more forgettable meal in the last 20 years. The service was very good but the food was not. I had the inaptly-named \"Breakfast of champions\" which comprised of scrambled egg of multiple colours (the white and yolk were not mixed properly), a few pieces of bacon that were glued together and two pieces of half toasted white bread.  The worst thing was that this came on a plastic plate with plastic knife and fork!! How can a place call itself a restaurant if you serve meals on plastic?  Will not be back."}
{"text":"New owner but the service and quality has remained the same. I can highly recommend the black bean burger if you stop in for lunch."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly & welcoming. The coffee is SO good! I get the Arizona Delight which is macadamia & white chocolate w/almond milk.  Cute little coffee shop, I love it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were quite impressed with this place overall.  The service was great which made it such a wonderful experience.    Eric was very hospitable and connected with us right away.    The sausage gravy was the best I have had, and I'm very particular.  However, the biscuits a bit dry like a scone.  No big deal.  The turkey sandy was great too and the bacon is awesome.  They use low sodium bacon and start it in the oven then press it on a panini press and it is perfectly crispy/crunchy and not over done.    The coffee is decent but coming from a snob it isn't high on my list.  The many different flavors were a nice touch and gave me some options but being a purist at heart I want the coffee to take precedence not the added flavors.  I know how hard it is to pull a proper shot and flavors just cover it up.    Very friendly for children.  We brought our 15 month old daughter with us and everyone made us feel welcome.  They also have a bin full of stuff for kids to play with.  Don't worry, they said that they clean them every day.    Bottom line:  We will come back here to try more food.  We feel this is a great place to become  a regular."}
{"text":"One day I was in a very negative mood - Just as i was about to go home and allow my rage to consume me, I stopped at this bakery and got a bread puddingish thing, which turned out to be an absolute piece of heaven. Suddenly everything was right in the world. The woman working was so kind to me. The bread puddingish piece of heaven was literally the most delicious thing I've eaten in a long time. I promise I almost cried because it improved my mood so greatly. They have chocolate shoes and all kinds of other cute things too! I HIGHLY recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I love this cute little coffee/bakery shop! I went my first time and the owner gave me a free chocolate for it being my first time! The food was also good and she can make just about any drink you want. Love this place."}
{"text":"Very cute coffee shop, great lunch options also. Had delicious cappuccinos, ham & Brie sandwich, soup, pork wrap, spinach scrambler, and turkey avocado sandwich. Everything was well prepared and reasonably priced. Service was excellent, very very friendly and delightful people. Gave us samples of their chocolates, absolutely delicious milk chocolate. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is hidden gem! A great breakfast & coffee shop. Pat & Eric are super friendly and always willing to make suggestions if you can't decide. The food is simple and truly delicious!!! My son has designated this as our go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"The service here is second to none. The drink choices are unique and very flavorful. If I lived in Phoenix I would come here regularly for my sweet tooth fix. All of the handmade chocolates are incredible."}
{"text":"This little hide-away is so worth checking out! Skip the Starbucks! They serve breakfast and lunch (try the biscuits and gravy!) Traditional British/French pastries, chocolates to die for and a complete selection of British/Scottish grocery items! And the really great coffee/espresso beverage selection is so comprehensive! They have special recipie drinks or just get your usual late. We got so much to take home (chocolate croissants anyone?) and will be back soon for my iced Mocha Late and my husband's sugar free iced vanilla late."}
{"text":"They have an extremely large array of different and unique types of lattes. I got a normal latte, but I'd definitely want to come again to give other ones a try.  The atmosphere is very welcoming and the staff there is great! They custom make chocolates themselves that look very pretty with a splatter of color on each piece. There is a unique flavor every month or so decided by the owner of Rayner's. The chocolates are very delicious and I would definitely recommend giving it a try. You could be convinced to buy many more! They would make for cute little gifts."}
{"text":"This place is a great British themed cafe/bistro. The staff is one of the most warmest I have ever encountered. When you come here it feels like home.   Great coffe, tea, lunch, and, British snack grocery. It's got everything.   Free wifi and tables w/outlets for getting work done.   Also, first timers get a complementary artisan Chocolate nugget."}
{"text":"First time to visit today & planning a return already.  Super friendly staff, the chocolates are to die for & real proper English tea with a hand knit tea cozy. Food was great - I had the Monte Cristo & it was perfect. Only downside is you have to go there soon as they are closing on December 24th when the owners move to England."}
{"text":"The stars aligned again and I was able to visit here for my second time.  I had the pleasure of having Pat serve me and she is simply amazing.  It is obvious that she cares for her customers and I hope to be able to visit more often and eventually become a regular.  Hubby ordered the same thing he had last time - the English sandwich and Peanut butter latte.  I wanted to try something new this time and ordered the Irish sandwich and Cinnamon bun latte.  The cinnamon bun latte does have an obvious cinnamon flavor to it and it was just sweet enough.  The menu describes the Irish sandwich as having caramelized onions as part of the composition but it was missing completely from mine.  Caramelized onions are one of my favorite food things but although it was missing, this was still an incredibly tasty and filling sandwich that I would order again.  Until next time!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute little coffee joint. We enjoyed our sandwiches and pastries and coffees. They have a nice assortment and a little shelf with import foods as well. All of the staff were super friendly. The place was pretty packed, so seating could be an issue if you arrive during a busy part of the day."}
{"text":"Wow.  This amazing place is tucked away just north of Thunderbird on 51st. Ave.  I was pleasantly surprised today at the service and quality of the food.  The chocolate croissant was light as a feather and amazing.  The coffee superb.  I was told they have home made New England Clam Chowder on Fri and Sat.  I cant wait."}
{"text":"Ahhh, \"The Benjamin\" with a \"Song of Songs Nut Cake\".... I'm attaining cognitive function!!! This is my first time to this joint, and I was very happy to be greeted with a friendly face so early in the morning. First visit you get a free piece of chocolate. She complemented my Benjamin with a dark chocolate with orange.  I'm looking forward to returning with my son!"}
{"text":"It doesn't matter what you get. It will be absolute perfection!! The beautiful fresh fruit cheese Danishes are to die for! The Irish breakfast sandwich is incredible. The Vietnamese pork sandwich is delicious. The roast beef pear sandwich, turkey cranberry, ham and Brie . The coffee. The chocolate. It's all perfect. And if you can't tell you --will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Coffees are amazing! Chocolates are so so good, and the people were super nice. Might just be my new favorite coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Amazing family-run restaurant. The highest quality ingredients. Of course their pastries and chocolates are exquisite, and leagues above what you can find elsewhere in Phoenix. Their wide-ranging menu blends styles and tastes, like sweet and tart. Such an intimate and welcoming atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Oh my this place rocks food is great and service out of this world. Found this place on yelp and had to give it a try. No other way to put it was a great experance!"}
{"text":"Small hidden place with fancy coffee. Overall very nice and the workers are friendly. We come as often as we can because the atmosphere is nice and the food is really good. I definitely recommend it to everybody!"}
{"text":"A little fun dive really off of 51st Avenue...Easy to find if you know where you are going. The store kinda wants to have this little European flair I guess...it wins in the pastry area, but not necessarily in the overall atmosphere.  Once inside, you will find a tasty display of some remarkable pastries including croissants, dry cookies, tarts etc..... In addition,  Rayner's also offers snacks and sandwiches. And if this is your first time visiting the store, they will offer you a complimentary chocolate.  Very nice staff - and there are also some shelves stocked with European goodies, even some candy bars I grew up with including Smarties Yeah!  The coffee is delightful. Thanks to Yelp - I found this place just looking for Espresso and  was pointed in Rayner's direction."}
{"text":"Wonderful Service and Fantastic food! Especially the Gluten free sandwich we had !!"}
{"text":"Very nice surprise,  a quaint friendly bakery, coffee cafe.... that emphasizes pastries, coffee, soups with a nice menu for breakfast and lunch...Such a nice experience we plan on being regulars... With everything made fresh , and a local supplier you cant go wrong and being a patron is the epitome of local support... tucked away off Thunderbird and 51st ave on the east side ...it is worth the visit... Did not have the soup but was told the clam chowder is to die for.... served on the weekends  I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Very cute little shop, and the employees made us feel very welcome and comfortable. The chocolate truffles, tea & Lattes were amazing."}
{"text":"I give rayners five stars because it is mom and pop, it is very clean, and the food leaves you feeling clean. It is very popular and I've had the garlic and potato sandwhich(I don't remember the name) the turkey and cranberry and Brie(I think that was the cheese) and it was really good. Their chocolates are nice and their tea and coffee have quality to them. You won't leave super full, but you will feel good about it."}
{"text":"Darling little coffee shop, somewhat hidden.  Service was great and the chocolate was delicious!  Great place for coffee and conversation.   Could be my new \"go to\" place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places! I love the service and sandwiches never disappoint. Of course, you must have a pastry! My favorite is the twice baked almond croissant. Stop in for lunch!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find a cafe in Arizona that serves tea in adorable china and sells British candy like Cadbury and Bounty. My niece and I visited Rayner's and almost right away decided that we would return the next day to try more of their pastries. Pat Rayner was kind enough to let us sample a couple of their chocolates - a Valentine chocolate lollipop for my niece and a dark chocolate bar sprinkled with candied ginger for me - and also gave my toddler son a delicious Italian shortbread cookie! Such a lovely idea to let your patrons sample an array of your products. We purchased a sandwich (the turkey avocado with bacon was delicious and made with quality ingredients), a custard pastry, and the to-die-for double baked almond croissants.   Rayner's also has a fun selection of flavored lattes, some named after customers who came up with the flavor combos. I tried an iced Elvis Latte (chocolate, PB, and banana) during my first visit and a Benjamin (dark mocha with orange) the next day.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My biggest issue with the latte's is that there are so many choices, I have a hard time making up my mind. I think they are the best in town. Add a sandwich, soup or pastie and you will have a great meal. Just when you think you can't eat another bite, you go pay the bill, spot the cookies and just have to have one. Friendly, cozy and free wi-fi. One of my new favorite spots."}
{"text":"Very delicious it was our first time here and they give you free chocolate. I got the biscuits and gravy yummy gravy. He got the English breakfast sandwich. The bacon was very crispy huge plus im pretty picky about bacon He got it without cheese and the bun was so deliciously buttered it still tasted like it had cheese to me which is awesome cause I love cheese. It is small and easily missed so keep your eye out for this gem!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Service and food are amazing, the ambience is very relaxed and have all kinds of things that you don't find anywhere else.  Their chocolate truffles are to die for."}
{"text":"What a great place! I am real picky about my coffee and Rayners has awesome coffee. Service was great and we even got a free little chocolate for our first time here. It was delicious also! We live right down the street and pass this place all the time, we will definitely be back. Had breakfast sandwiches and they were super good too. Very impressed with this place."}
{"text":"It's a cute, little café. Not much room between tables; felt like I was part of everyone's conversation. Next time, I'll grab and go."}
{"text":"My cinnful latte (cinnamon and Irish cream) is to die for, I found Welsh tea, and the food is incredible! A true UK treasure hidden away across from ASU West."}
{"text":"It's a small place only 26 chairs and 8 tables in the space but the food is good. Try the pesto pita !"}
{"text":"I popped in here the other weekend. I had just gotten back from a city renowned for its coffee and was looking for a decent latte.  This is a very nice, family run joint with some tasty looking treats. All I can speak to was the lemon bar and coffee that I consumed in a flash, and I can attest that both were quite good. Drop by if you're in the area, this seems to be a great local business that deserves the support of the community they service."}
{"text":"My co-worker brought me and there sandwiches are delicious. The workers are very pleasant and greet you like your family.. thank you again"}
{"text":"This is such a cool place! We had breakfast and it was delicious! Staff is very friendly. Bonus you get a  a piece of chocolate your first visit!"}
{"text":"First timer here and I ordered the Greek gyro, filled with a lot of meat & it as pretty darn amazing!   My boyfriend has been here prior and mentioned the great sandwiches. He ordered the turkey Rueben this trip; taste great and the bread was perfectly grilled.   Awesome service & the waiter rocks. Thank you for the great environment!"}
{"text":"First time here today.  I brought my husband who is extremely picky. I was worried about his reaction to trying something new. He got a bacon, sausage, egg and cheese sandwich that he was thoroughly impressed with. I got the bacon, egg and cheese on some bread I hadn't heard of. It was so good I wish it wouldn't have ended. Since we didn't eat there we stood and waited for out food and coffee. We decided to buy some of the chocolates. Since I am currently full I will have to update after chocolate consumption.  It is a quaint little shop with some amazing greeting cards and a lot of eye candy on the walls. If you are in the neighborhood stop by and try it."}
{"text":"An amazing place! It is like being invited to a British friend's house for dining/tea or coffee. I can't add anything that everyone else has not already said. Everything was terrific but I especially liked the Breakfast Cookie. The service was truly special. The first timer free chocolate was a great touch. I will be back often. If you need Great Britain imports check them out."}
{"text":"What can I say but WoW! My wife recently read about this place in the paper.  If you did not know it was there you would probably never find this place. It is situated off 51 ave. just north of Thunderbird.There is a strip of stores that run east and west and they are situated about half way down this strip of stores.  When I walked through the door I knew immediately I would like this place.  My wife and I shared a pastry and a couple of short bread cookies. Don't ask the names we just picked what we thought would be a good selection for a first visit. OH! You get a piece of chocolate free on your first visit.  I did not look at a menu but saw some of the specials posted on the walls. Now I am planning a trip soon to have breakfast.  Decoration is for me hard to describe. Comfortable, friendly, clean, a place to meet a friend for breakfast or lunch, not just once but many times. There are two separate rooms where you can sit and eat plus outside. In the room we were in there was a wall with many different foods from England.  Even though they were very busy the owner and one of the helpers took time to talk to us.  Everything we had was very good. Or what I should say much better than good.  Give them a try. I know you will be as impressed as I was."}
{"text":"Alright,  back again.    Haven't visited since 2013.   This delightful English cafe sticks out amongst the breakfast choices across the entire northwest valley like the positive version of a sore thumb.    Around these parts there are 5 or so breakfast spots offering dissapointingly similar fare amidst a backdrop of barely consistent quasi-good table service. To prove that more culture and better food is desperately needed here, people stand around waiting an hour sometimes for a table at these tired,  dried up, cliche diners only to be served yesterday's specials,  at tomorrow's prices. During there wait the guests can be overheard discussing the good old days of breakfast buffets and church specials mostly unaware that downtown and in the east valley breakfast has been taken hostage by a growing amount of young, hip eateries offering delicious food. Those in the know from the west valley wake up early, strap their kids into their car seats with their sunglasses on to drive East. East into the sunrise and away from this grey, oppressive landscape up to 20 miles just to no longer be the victim of the West side breakfast blues  Alas,  Rayners to the rescue!   With their inventive menu, mom and pop service,  and delicious drink offerings this place is like the creative,  artistic sibling to the surrounding resteraunts that everyone in the family knows will move to New York and be really famous someday.    My sandwich had egg,  bacon and almonds.  It was slap your momma good.  My girl ate a bagel with a kaleidoscope of jalapeño lime jelly sausage goodness while we both shared a black raspberry lavender iced tea.   Seriously considering deleting this post because I don't want the word to get out and have to deal with the lines as the rest of you cardboard eaters finally get hip to the idea that you deserve better."}
