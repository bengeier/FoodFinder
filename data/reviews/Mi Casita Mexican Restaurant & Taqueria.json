{"text":"This is not what it used to be.   The once mighty and satisfying Mia Pueblo is gone.   Residing in its former shell, a slightly more expensive, less traditional restaurant; not a taqueria.   The new owner(s) had a simple task, make it a little better.    Look at what made the former great, and expand on it.  Clean up the dinning room, put out some promotions, gather a stronger base.  None of that seems to have happend.  Now the Tacos revered by many are dry and tasteless.  The snacks are nonexistant and nachos (as if we needed another order of nachos) are sad in both flavor and presentation. I really wanted to like this place.   I needed to like this place.   I cannot like this place.  

  The new owners seem very nice, I feel for them.  They are obviously putting in the hours.   This will not be enough.   It is the product and the service that matters.   I beg the owners, if it is not too late, bring back the amazing eats.   Until then I will pass.

All hail the king of cleveland's mexican grub: La Plaza Supermarket.  Learn to make your own mexican.   It is the only game in town."}
{"text":"Corona-Rita = GREAT. Authentic Mexican flavors = GREAT! I have been coming here since I was a teenager, when it was a burrito stand with the grocery store next door. We were unaware the establishment was under new ownership. The food was just as good as I remember. For any grigos fortunate enough to have vacationed in Mexico, this is as good as it gets. The drinks and food TASTE LIKE VACATION! Highly recommended! Best of luck to the new chef/owners!"}
{"text":"I couldn't agree more with everybody that is saying this is NOT Mi Pueblo.  Just got back from dinner.  Burritos are $6.99. The extra order form in the menu for you to build your burrito or taco states rice or beans come with the burrito.  There were two of us.  We ordered a steak burrito, a chicken burrito, 1 with rice, 1 with beans, 3 Margaritas, which we asked to be made with Don Julio tequilla, and 1 dos equis draught.  When ordering, we asked how much the margaritas were, we were told $7.99.  Our bill was $63.00.  By my calculations our food amounted to  $14.00, 3 Margaritas and a draught beer totaled $49.00.  Insane for a margarita made with bottled mix, and a dos equis that tasted like it had been in the keg since Mi Pueblo was pouring.  When we asked for a break down, of our bill, they were charging us for the rice and beans the menu clearly states comes with the burrito.  They ended up adjusting the bill by less than 3 dollars.  We won't be going back!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently had dinner here and found it to be the same delicious food as Mi Pueblo. I have tried the tortas for lunch, the fajatas for dinner as well as the pinapple milk shake.
I always ask for a sugar free milk shake and they oblige. It is served in a huge goblet.
The prices are reasonable and the staff is very accomodating.  Some reviewers noticed that the chips are different since the new owners took over from Mi Pueblo. I don't eat the chips so I didn't really notice."}
{"text":"Being from Los Angeles, I know, I set a high bar as far as Mexican food goes. That being said, this was dreadful. I ordered a chile relleno, and a side of guacamole. The chile arrived on a plate that was covered with water and grease (so the rice was all wet and soggy). The guacamole had shredded anejo cheese in it -- disgusting. I guess it does stretch the avocados a bit, but it was inedible. Never again."}
{"text":"This isn't the standard generic Americanized Mexican food. You'll probably figure that out once you see beef tongue tacos or goat stew on the menu. While the interior/ambiance is a little rough/lacking, if you're looking for something more authentic (I guess it depends on your definition/version of authentic) you should be in luck. There's lots of interesting menu choices that sound fantastic.

Good service and parking lot in back of building.

I had the Cubana torta and it was delicious. The salsa was good as it had a bit of heat. Unremarkable guacamole and tortilla chips. 

I want to return to try out the tacos and some of the specialties."}
{"text":"I'm so sad right now. Mi Pueblo was my favorite place in the area for Mexican food and when I first heard that the name changed, everyone said the food would stay the same as it was really just a change in management. I kept my hopes up and decided to give the new place a chance.. 
food. At all. Almost nothing is the same except the decor and sign on the outside! 
No, it's not the same 

The menu is very small now, for one. They also have just one table salsa (instead of the two amazing ones they had before) and the salsa is just okay. PLUS the chips are NOT FRESH anymore. They used to be incredibly fresh and hot but now they have them sitting under a heating lamp and they're boarderline stale by the time you get them. 

The food itself is fine but is honeslty no better than any other Meixcan place now. El Jalapenos is basically the same thing but has a bigger menu, even. Everything before was so good and there were so many options but now, as a vegetarian, I had maybe 4 options and only one appealed to me. So selection was a huge disappointment and while the food itself wasn't gross, it just wasn't anything special. 

Oh, I also asked for sangria (which was awesome at Mi Pueblo) and was given a sangria flavored carbonated soda. Uhhh what? You should have said \"no, we don't have sangria but we have soda flavored like it.\" Not \"yes, we have that!\" You do not have sangria. Do you guys not know what sangria actually is? The margaritas were also a let down. Super sweet and clearly no effort put in whatsoever. 

The last thing I can think to add is that the food also isn't worth the price anymore, even. It's not terribly overpriced or anything but just isn't good enough for how much I spent on my dinner. It was a bummer. 

The only silver lining, for me, was the guacamole con queso. Lots of cilantro and good flavors overall. However, one good dish of guacamole isn't enough to keep me coming back..  I sadly do not plan to return to this restaurant and will miss Mi Peublo always! I'm only giving 2 stars instead of 1 because I think the urge to give just one is because I can't stop comparing it to the former restaurant. Without the comparison, it's just nothing special but isn't terrible. With the comparison, I'm increidbly disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying, I really do miss Mi Pueblo's. Mi Casita is not Mi Pueblo by any stretch of the imagination. I would actually probably only give 3.5 stars but that's not an option, so we'll throw I a bonus half star in hopes that they don't let me down! 
My boyfriend took his mom and I here for a birthday margarita, hoping they hadn't changed the recipe of those delicious Mi Pueblo margaritas...the margaritas were good, but lacked some of the kick from our good friend MP. His mom really liked the lime pepper salt that lined the glasses. The food was good, and the manager did tell us that they can make anything that was on the old menu. Apparently, the restaurant is managed by the same family as Mi Pueblo. My vegetable fajitas were made with fresh vegetables, not frozen, and I got a decent amount. 
My boyfriend and his mom both ordered vegetable enchiladas, one did mole, one did rojo sauce. They both enjoyed their meals, especially mom.
A real highlight was the guacamole chipotle. It had a nice heat to it and was a hit with everyone at the table. 
Service was very good. Attentive, friendly.
It's hard not to compare them to Mi Pueblo, since Mi Pueblo did set the bar very high. I compare them to other Mexican restaurants and they are a solid 3.5, and hopefully they will improve on the next visit to a 4."}
{"text":"The scenery is fine, get over it. If you want ambiance, go to Momocho. Food is excellent and refried black beans are great. Margaritas do the job and aren't as syrupy as Villa y Zapata. Come eat here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super friendly and welcoming service.  Great prices, food, and drinks.  It's my neighborhood spot. It's not swanky or anything.  Leave your snobbiness at the door."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awful now.  TheLuchitas people gave it a go and walked out on it when they saw it was hopeless.  I went there in hopes of some sign the former Muy Pueblo.  The salsa tastes like its out of a can,  The chips were old and soggy and my burrito was 1/2 of what it used t be.  All of the Mexicans are gone. I had a white server which was strange.  I was always used to the servers barely understanding english.  I have no reason to go there any more. I sadly will never go back.  The best taqueria now is in the back of La Plaza supermarket.  Its sad."}
{"text":"Went for the first time since the change from Mi Pueblo. Heard mixed reviews, but I will say had a great meal that was consistent with the old place.  Had a Mariachi band not only was very good, but full of personality.  Usually not a fan, but these guys nailed it.

The four of us really enjoyed our meals and again mine was authentic as when it was Mi Pueblo, so not complaints.  Crowded and good service.  Going with a four since they stepped up on a busy night and look forward to going back.  

Not Mi Pueblo but still a gem for all of us to enjoy!"}
{"text":"It is a shame the negative reviews kept me out of Mi Casita for so long. One individual has 4 reviews at all 1 star rating. This person either has one of the most discerning palates in all of Cuyahoga County or is a grump. I give a lot of 5 star reviews. They are not Michelin stars. They are PW Yelp stars. A Yelper may ride a commuter bike while his beard blows in the wind yet this does not make him the ghost of James Beard. 

The tacos at Mi Casita are excellent. The menu is a little small for entrees. A few tacos is all I need from a good Taqueria anyhow. The abominations at Barrio fly off shelves and tacos are all that is served there with no complaints. I only go to Barrio when lurking for single women and drinking. Ask the server at Mi Casita for the additional taco menu and order a few. They are $2 a piece and delicious. I had al pastor, carnita, barbacoa and pollo. They were all very satisfying and hold their own against La Plaza. The tortas look great and will try one on my next visit. Ignore the hateful reviews and stop on up to Mi Casita on Lorain for some outstanding Mexican street food."}
