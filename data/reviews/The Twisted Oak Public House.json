{"text":"Careful ordering a beer here near last call... May come with unexpected side of attitude"}
{"text":"Rude barstaff, drunk customers, great for the regulars not so good for anyone else. The liquor board should shut this place down, they don't seem to realize there are serving laws in this province and when a drunken regular starts arguing with a sober patron it's the barstaffs job to remove the drunk from the premises regardless of how good of a friend they are. It's unfortunate places like this are able to fly under the radar. I guess we'll have to wait till one of these patron kills someone with their vehicle before something is done. Be careful when driving near this place, it might be you."}
{"text":"I much prefer when this was c.w coops. The wings were 100x better. Last time I went in, I ordered a pitcher and fries. The fries came with a strand of hair which I've added to this listing. I didnt bother to complain. I just kept drinking. The wings here are good but I much prefer coops or wing house(wow wing?) In Newmarket. The washrooms are clean and the staff are pretty friendly.  Wednesday is or was half price wings. That's the only time in my opinion when its worth going. The poutine is pretty good as well as the poppers however after finding hair in my fries, I wouldn't eat here again."}
