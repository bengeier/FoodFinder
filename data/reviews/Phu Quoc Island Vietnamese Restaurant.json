{"text":"One of the best pho in the area I've ever had. Went with some friends and the service was excellent. Very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"This little gem on hwy7 is tucked away upstairs in time square, but people should really know about this place! The food is soooooo good, and the prices are reasonable. Vietnamese,  Chinese and Thai food all in one place. The beef broth for Pho is probably one of the best in town! We also ordered their Cantonese chow mien and wow, it was so pretty & full of flavour.  

I think Vietnamese restaurants are usually pretty dirty but this place was not like that at all. The place is bright and very clean!

I recommend people try this hidden gem out!"}
{"text":"Was fairly disappointed with this new take over. Soup is filled with MSG and is lacking taste. Basically flavourless. Whenever I eat at a Vietnamese restaurant, before even touching the food, the first thing I do is have a spoonful of their soup. Usually this is already the predictor of how the rest of their food is. I was fairly disappointed with the flavourless warm water I received with my noodles.

Don't even get me started of the spring roll. I love Viet spring rolls. It is an item I always get at Viet restaurants. This one was horrifying.. I know they won't go soaking up the oil in their food with paper towels but at least the spring roll didn't have to be drenched in oil. When I bit into it.. Oil just came bursting out of all sides.. If the spring roll was a towel and I could ring it out like a towel.. Oil would come oozing out of it. 

Service was alright. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try! My friends and i stumbled upon this restaurant through Yelp and it did not disappoint! We went during rush hour so the service was a tad slower but the food was amazing. I got a small beef noodle soup and my friends got the Bun Bo Hue and the vermicelli with spring rolls and grilled chicken. The beef noodle soup was full of flavour! Nothing like I've had before, it was delicious. Would definitely come back to try more things!"}
{"text":"There is a Vietnamese restaurant at this location, but I do not know the current name as there is no English writing anywhere. Nonetheless, I just had lunch there with a friend and it was extremely disappointing. We shared a beef bun, which was delicious. Fried whole whiting were good, as were the lamb skewers, but they were just plonked down on a white plate. There was no attempt at an attractive presentation, so 'the eyes' were not impressed. We also shared Dandan noodles, which had a horrid bitter flavor. We both disliked that dish.We would neither of us go back."}
{"text":"This place used to be a pretty good was Vietnamese restaurant. It newly renovated and I guess changed name and owners.

We walked in on a Saturday around 12:30pm, the restaurant was empty and there was only one server working and he seems to be setting up and getting ready to serve, which I feel was very unorganized because you would expect to be ready to serve at that time on a Saturday.

There are around 10 different choices in each categories such as chicken, beef, noodles, appetizers, chef's selection. 

We ordered a Vietnamese spring roll and a noodle in soup with fish, pork and seaweed.

The spring rolls came with pickled carrots on the side on a small bed of lettuce.
The pickled carrots were terrible, worse I have EVER had! It was not sour at all but had the smell of vinegar. The spring rolls were BAD, it was crunchy but they did not soak the oil at all, they didn't even bother putting lettuce at the bottom of the plate to cover/soak up some of the oil. It looked very unappealing to lift a spring roll and see that the plate was full of oil and grease. As you bite into the spring roll, you can only taste the meat with NO flavour or seasoning but plenty of oil bursting into your mouth, I felt I was eating oil more than anything!

The noodle in soup was completely TASTELESS!! It just tasted like plain water with a little bit of flavour from the meat, there wasn't any salt added for flavour, no spices or herbs, whatsoever to make the soup taste better. It tasted like water more than soup/broth. I had to add hot sauce, salt, some sweet sauce to make my noodle taste better. There was absolutely nothing special about this noodle but yet they said it was chef's selection.

One star goes to the service since servers were polite and kind. 

I would not recommend anyone going there for their food, unless you enjoy tasteless food!
Save your money elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"This resto is primarily for the chinese population nearby. The menu is in chinese and english. No vietnamese! The resto was pretty empty when I was there. Lots of servers standing around with nothing to do. And as a result, service was quick. Food was average at best. A free appetizer and dessert was offered and very much appreciated. Got the opening 10% off discount. Rice dish was average. Vermicilli dish was pretty good. I would come back only if I was stuck in the area."}
{"text":"2.5/5

I'm definitely questioning those 5-star reviews I'm seeing. Maybe I didn't order the right items or my experience was one-off, but I was definitely not satisfied with my visit here.

Phu Quoc Island is located at the 2nd floor of Times Square, where the former Top Saigon/First Choice was. They didn't do much to it aside from (poorly) replacing the first few Chinese characters and the English letters below. It's still brightly lit and upscale, for what matters.

They had some grand opening specials, which made me wonder whether the variety will be lacking once the whole opening hype dies down. I decided to order from the grand opening specials and a couple of appetizers as well.

I started with a Vietnamese spring roll and a grilled beef fresh roll. These were both actually quite good, and I would be perfectly content to come here just for an afternoon snack to have those items. We also had mix chicken and beef BBQ satay skewers, which wasn't bad but nothing memorable.

For the noodle soup, I ordered the crab meat \"tapioca\" noodle soup. I was expecting the tapioca noodle soup to be of the thick udon kind, but it was actually vermicelli, which disappointed me. The vermicelli was also overcooked and broke apart too easily. In addition to the crab meat and vietnamese sausage slices, there were also other pork-related ingredients in there such as pig blood, etc. The extra ingredients didn't hide out the fact that the noodle portions were quite small unfortunately.

Free dessert was offered, which was the same as Jennifer K's dessert. For the record, there wasn't much taste to it.

The female servers were both great, but the male server didn't speak much. He never mentioned what noodle soups were being brought out, as my mom and dad both ordered different bowls than mine.

I don't think I'll return here to be honest, unless the elite reviews after mine continue to be 4 star calibre."}
{"text":"This place is the most authentic Vietnamese food in the Richmond Hill/Markham area. Service is quick and staff are very friendly. Currently they have a couple of grand opening specials on their menu as well as 10% off. Highly recommended (and this is coming from someone who grew up on Vietnamese food)!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Vietnamese deep fried egg noodles. Crispy but not oily and this is the best fried noodle that I've ever had. The grill oyster and soft shell crab roll are good, too! Didn't expect to have these type of food at a Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Phu Quoc Island Vietnamese Restaurant is a newly opened Singaporean/Thai/Vietnamese Restaurant located on the 2nd floor at Times Square.

If you have been to the previous several Vietnamese restaurants in this location, you will find the layout and the decoration is basically very similar. Phu Quoc did refreshened it up and give it a brighter look.

There are quite a few interesting items on the menu that is quite unique which you might not find in other Vietnamese restaurants. So worth giving it a try and be a little adventurous aside from eating Pho all the time.

Vietnamese Style Duck Leg Noodle ($7.50) with a light aroma of orange peel and the duck leg was prepared like a confit. Here you can see the influence of \"Chinese\" and \"French\" in Vietnamese cuisine. Duck Leg was so so... 

Vietnamese Style Deep Fried Chicken Wings in Tamarind Sauce ($6.50) was pretty good value with 5 whole wings in an order. The wings itself was quite meaty. I enjoyed the sourness of tamarind which kind of balance the oiliness. The meat inside though a little bland. Maybe if the wings can be marinated a little?

For their Grand Opening Special, they do offers 10% off. We also offered a little appetizer to munch on and some dessert at the end of the meal.

Maybe I was having a high expectation with those 5 star review. But for me definitely an A-OK and I would be coming back to try out other dish and even Pho and other Noodle Soup."}
