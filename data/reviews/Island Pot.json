{"text":"3.5/5

I've been here a few times and had the following items:  

*Curry Chicken which comes with rice, salad and some type of potatoes with pepper sauce on the side.  The curry chicken was very flavourful but not very spicy. It was more sweet.  However, I got a side of peppers sauce and boy was this ever hot.  

*Bake & Shark - crispy patty and it kind of taste like grouper fish with vegetables.  It's something very different and it's worth a try.  

Service: staff is very friendly. 

However, what's a bit odd is that their menu changes from day to day and even though it may be posted on the wall menu, it may not be available that day.  It's really confusing.  

Verdict: In terms of food quality, I'd probably give it 4 stars, however it loses a star for confusing and inconsistent menu.  so 3 stars.   However, we'll give it a 0.5 starts extra for being new and hopefully they work out the kinks."}
{"text":"I recently visited this restaurant and tried a few of the items on the menu. My son had the macaroni pie with stewed chicken while I had the rice, red beans with stewed chicken which we both enjoyed.  My second son enjoyed the baked chicken with fried rice special.  He thought that it was quite good as well.  I also tried a portion of the curry chicken.  This was okay, but there was no potato in the dish which sucked.  I like potato with my curried chicken and didn't think that I had to order that separately.

I gave a 4 star rating because (1) my elder son got macaroni and rice but no red beans although the choices were pie or rice and either red beans or callaloo, and I did request red beans (2) there was no callaloo when I was there around 1 pm and (3) they put salad dressing on the salad without asking - not everyone likes salad dressing.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant and hope that it stays in business.  The fare here is different from what is offered by other Caribbean restaurants in the area.  The portions are good for the prices paid. 

Maybe they run out of stuff because the demand is low and they don't want to waste food.  Hopefully more people will try their dishes now that these reviews have been posted."}
{"text":"Now that you're finished laughing about the connotation of the name of this restaurant, here's the review...

A coupla weeks ago, Island Pot took over a \"cursed corner\" of a strip mall right across the street from T.L. Kennedy, a coupla units down from Buk Chang.  I say \"cursed\" because this unit seems to have a high turnover rate of various types of ethnic restaurants.  Despite the competition of other West Indian (Trini) restaurants in the area, hopefully this family run joint is here to stay!

After perusing the posted menu, I ordered a Curry Goat Roti (Parantha), bone-in, $7.99.  While waiting for my order, the owner (??) asked enthusiastically if I tried Bake & Shark.  I said that I'll try it next time as I had already put in my order for the Roti.  He then asked if I wanted to try one for free, in which I happily obliged!

The Fried Bake, the fried bread, was the size of a kaiser roll, but flatter was freshly fried.  And the shark piece was thin, but good ratio for the size of the bread.  What really added to the sandwich was the fresh toppings & sauces!  These toppings/sauces included freshly cut pineapple, red onions, lettuce, garlic sauce, mango chutney, tamarind chutney, & chadon beni (culantro).

I ate both the Bake & Shark and a bit of the Curry Goat Roti after running a few errands, once I got home.  Parantha had turned a bit rubbery, but that was after sitting in my car.  So I'd advise that you eat BOTH of them shortly after getting your order.  Flavour of the Curry Goat was good, not too salty or the meat gristly.  

If you haven't tried the Fried Bake, I'd recommend that.  It was REALLY GOOD!  Although the Roti is better in terms of value for money as the portion is definitely LARGER for the same price.

Would definitely visit again, especially if I wanted to dine-in!"}
