{"text":"Alf Hana is the only shawarma place in that NW corner so I'm glad this one opened up, it's better as well imo. The shawarma was nothing special tbh but good enough for me to not to have to go to Streetsville so often to get one and it's two for $9 which is a good deal, chicken platter isn't bad either. Sometimes they don't put enough sauce in so you gotta ask. The lentil soup doesn't really have much flavour but it's healthy. Cheeseburger has an average homemade taste along with the fries (though some prefer home style fries) so I would prefer to just stick to the shawarma (or falafel for vegetarians).  Owner seems like a nice guy, prices are good, and it's not big but I like the clean dine-in options/space along with a bit of outdoor space. The outdoor tables face a Walmart and a GO station so not the nicest view but at least they have the option."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place randomly; my favourite find so far, all month. The service is excellent - the restaurant is owned by a lovely couple who are extremely friendly, made very helpful recommendations, and just about saved my day at the end when, after waiting an hour more in the rain for my MIA bus with a dead phone, they helped me call a cab.  I had the shawarma platter - this came with a salad which, by the way, is a definite must-try. The platter itself was excellent; the bread and went together perfectly with the tangy and just-rig hummus, the beef was perfectly cooked, tender and savoury, and the fries I had ordered as a side instead of the rice option were perfect. The menu is pretty diverse with a lot of combo options that provide good value for money, but the restaurant's main USP, I would think, is the authenticity of the food. Having lived in the Middle East (Muscat, Oman) for about 13 years, I've rarely found restaurants in other parts of the world that have the same kind of quality, so this was a refreshing discovery.  All in all, a good idea for a post-work dinner take-out, great service and very good food!"}
{"text":"I go to this place a lot since it's close to my work. Ultimately what I like about this place is that their meat is really well seasoned, which sets it apart from a lot of others. It's one of my favourite Shawarma places in this price range."}
