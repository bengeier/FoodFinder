{"text":"Amazing! Just had the farmers plate - my first time having plantains. Insanely delicious. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"What can I say, I really can't name a negative thing about this place. Don't judge it by the name. The food is exceptional and the service is friendly. This was the best Cuban sandwich I've ever had. Everything is super fresh. I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Awesome, HOMEMADE food! Great flavor, great quality and the price is right The owners and staff were terrific and made us feel so welcome. They love what they're doing and it shows in the food. This is just what Berea needed!"}
{"text":"Had the pork shoulder and it was really good.  Nothing prepackaged about it, taste like what mom would make.  If mom was from PR and not IN!    So I can't vouch for authenticity, but seems to have all the flavors that should be there."}
{"text":"When I looked on Yelp for Puerto Rican  food restaurant Csmpus Grill came up. You can watch the cook prepare your food completely from start to finish, and it is well worth the wait.  I highly recommend the pork or beef empanadas I've never seen empanadas packed with so much meat (fantastic Latin flavoring). The Mofongo with chicharron  was fantastic. I will have to say this is a contender for Latin food from the Bronx, New York"}
{"text":"This is tucked away in Berea! Find it and get the MoFongo or the Roasted Pork Shoulder (Pernil) and the Tostones (labled as Chips and Guac) and get it with the garlic sauce-the way it was meant to be... ...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is Puerto Rican food designed to appeal to the masses; it's not as seasoned, flavorful and dare I say, unhealthy, as \"traditional\" Puerto Rican food. Keep that in mind, but know that The Campus Grille does a great job of conforming to Berea's foodscape for the individual looking to dabble in Caribbean cuisine.   Restaurant is nice and clean. There's a pretty small menu and you can watch the cooks prepping ingredients while you wait. There are agua frescas and malta (in addition to other soft drinks) in a cooler- I recommend Malta.     Bf had pork, rice and beans and a salad while I had pork mofongo. The pork was pretty dry and lacked substantial seasoning, other than garlic. I was surprised there was no yellow rice (arroz y gandules) but instead white rice with pinto beans. The pintos were really good! I would go back to get those alone. Mofongo was decent, if not extremely garlicky due to the pork. I was disappointed that other rican food wasn't offered. Where's the empanadillas? The morcilla? The plantains? Other than some minor grievances, we enjoyed food and large portions, opting to take half home.   If I was in the area, I would go back for pinto beans. If you're looking to try out a new cuisine, I would give it a try."}
{"text":"Best place ever.  Why aren't these everywhere?!? Drove up from Columbus to surprise my husband with mofongo for his birthday. We love to travel to Puerto Rico for the food and this is even better food. Food is awesome. Service is fast, friendly and energetic.  Glad to see they have a larger space."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  All the reviews are true! It was our favorite restaurant while our daughter was at BW."}
{"text":"My wife had the Cuban sandwich and I had the Pollo Loco. We both had pork empanadillas.  The food was fantastic and the employees were delightful.  Definitely coming back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Best cuban sandwich i've ever had! Small family owned shop in downtown Berea. Everyone was very friendly and the food is very fresh. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally, we made it to Campus Grill!  The food was delicious.  We ordered numerous items from the menu and enjoyed everything.  There were no bad choices.  The ingredients are fresh and plentiful.  We enjoyed it so well that we bought a gift certificate for a family member's birthday.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing very authentic great place to eat if you want great Latin food. The owner is very nice great friendly staff."}
{"text":"I get the rotisserie pork shoulder all the time.  I can't stop telling my friends how good this place is!"}
{"text":"My opinion of the food isn't even relevant because I can't believe how rude the owner was. When you are a business owner, you should take pride in your product. You should also understand that the only reason you are in business is because of the customer.  To not take the time to answer questions for a guest or to answer a question when asked to explain a dish with a sarcastic tone is really disappointing.  When a guest asks you if you have tostones the appropriate response isn't \"how do you think we make mofongo?\". A great answer would be \"yes we do\".  When a guest asks you about your coconut rice and your response is \"I mean....its coconut rice\" again, it's disappointing.  A great answer would be \"would you like to try a sample\" or \"it's sweet\"... Or...\"it's not very sweet...\".  Perhaps you don't want to take the time to explain your menu to guests that are Latino/Hispanic because you may be falsely assuming we are guaranteed to return. You seem to have no problem taking the time to explain your menu to a Caucasian.  You also had no problem bragging about how your restaurant is the first one that pops up when you google search it if you're at the airport. You had no problem going into detail about how much foot traffic you get from the airport and how great your business is doing.  As a Latino who grew up in the Cleveland area it's really exciting to see a Hispanic business take off.  However it's rather disappointing and embarrassing to see the owner be sarcastic and arrogant. I've seen you on local TV networks and in the local papers.  However, let me remind you that you have one chance to make a first impression.  That's why it doesn't matter if your food is good or not to my liking... To be treated sarcastically and rudely is a guaranteed lost customer.  The examples I listed are not solely mine... They are from family members/friends as well as my own first hand experience.  I can confidently say I will not return. Since Hispanic restaurants are so few and far between in the Cleveland area it is unfortunate that I as a Latino would not return.  You do not have the right to treat people rudely just because you feel so confident that your business is doing well. Or, again, maybe you are only rude/sarcastic to Hispanics because you think you can be.  Remember that you represent not only yourself but a larger population of fellow Latinos.   You have the responsibility of treating all guests with respect.  As a business owner you have the obligation to explain your menu with the same care and consistency that you would for any guest.    Hopefully others will benefit from this post if you read it and in turn treat your guests with respect and not sarcasm."}
{"text":"I've been trying to go here, but they open later than I have lunch usually.  I made a point of going today, and it was well worth it.  I've had Cuban food only once before, but even with little point of reference, the food was fantastic.  I had the roast pork (shredded) with Spanish rice and red beans.  It was flavorful, juicy, and perfect for lunch.  I even got it for $5 for a lunch promo they are running right now.  Couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  The food is delicious and extremely reasonably priced, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the service couldn't be friendlier and more welcoming.   Cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise ! The food is outstanding and it is obvious that everyone working there truly enjoys what they are doing. Their joy is apparent in the flavor of the foods they prepare. The name of the place does not prepare you for the flavorful range of Latin American foods. The atmosphere is quaint and relaxingly casual. We truly enjoyed our interactions with all of the employees as well as excellent quality of the foods. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Mo Mofongo Por Favor. If you want the best mofongo in Cleveland come here. I could also literally drink their garlic sauce, it is sooooo good. I have tried the shrimp, chicaron, and beef mofongo, both I would gladly get again. . .and again and again and again. The price might look steep for a Latin American stand in line to order eatery, but the portion size and quality is amazing and well worth it. They do have seating inside, but it is limited to about 30 people. It is a great place to go and order something quick (usually only takes 10 minutes for them to get your order finished) then take everything with you. The cuban sandwich, empanadillas, and desserts are all excellent as well, but let's not kid ourselves gourmands come here for the mofongo."}
{"text":"We've been a few times and the food is really solid. Made on site, fresh and to order. The plantain chips with guacamole are outstanding, meats are well prepared and seasoned, and the mofongo was tasty (i liked that it came with salad - the dressing is really good!).   The owner is friendly and enthusiastic about his food; he was also very helpful with answering questions about ingredients so my girlfriend could be confident that her meal was gluten free.   It's a nice change of pace from most of the restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. I ordered the pork and beans n rice. The portion was generous. The staff is friendly. For a treat I ordered the apple empanada and my friend ordered the guava cheese and they were both delicious."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times. Their food is amazing, reasonable price, friendly staff and very authentic! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Family owned and run business. They take tremendous pride in their establishment and treat each and every single customer as if they were eating in their house. The staff is wonderful and the location is very clean. The pink beans have a delicious taste. The pork is perfect. Absolutely delicious. Mofongo is generally my favorite, but not here. It's made w too much oil and is served \"seco\" (dry) vs w \"caldito\" on the side to drizzle on it as you eat as mofongo is traditionally served. (Caldito is \"sauce\" from other stewed meat, or even beans.) They don't make a true mojo sauce for the tostones. Their mojo sauce is just minced garlic in oil (not very appetizing). A true mojo is made w garlic, good olive oil, vinegar or lime juice, and some spices. The oily flavorless stuff they put on the tostones and in the mofongo detracts significantly from the dishes. Why am I still a fan? Because everything else is on point! We've been a few times. We've brought friends, and recommended it to others. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"When you get tired of eating \"The Usual\", go try out The Campus Grille! They're awesome. Great customer service and tasty food, from what I've had so far!"}
{"text":"The best you'll get without a plane ticket. I've been here several times already & have had something different each time.  It's all good.  Everything is super fresh, so it takes a little longer to get your order; so you'll want to plan for that when you come. You'll find it's well worth the wait though. I've never waited longer than 10 minutes for my meal."}
{"text":"The most authentic Puerto Rican food you'll find aside from actually going to P.R. Get everything!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointing! They boast authentic food, but what they serve is bland and overpriced. Cubano sandwich was soggy and flavorless and the macaroni salad side was even worse. We did like the Pasteles but it was so expensive we only got one to share. We were excited to go and support a minority business owner, but he is not doing any of these classics justice."}
{"text":"The food at The Campus Grille is very good. The menu however is limited. The Cuban sandwich is outstanding (no pickles). Chicken with rice and beans is real good as well. However, more often than not the rice is salted to the high end of acceptability. One gripe is the flimsy plastic silverware that Is prone to breaking. Also, after being only open less than a month they jacked up the prices a lot. I won't be coming back as often because of it. They are probably making the common mistake of believing BW students have a lot of money.  I wont recommend them anymore because of the price hike. I'm sorry but more than 8 bucks for Farmers plate which is vegetarian is a little much."}
{"text":"The mofongo is absolutely amazing! Once we started coming here we never went anywhere else for Puerto Rican food. Super fresh and great service!!!"}
{"text":"So Good! I didn't know what to order so I took the suggestion of chicken with yellow rice and beans-the chicken was perfectly cooked and the rice and beans were so flavorful!  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Ate their once and have never been back.  While waiting for my order, I was able to see into the food prep area.  After what I saw, I will never be back.  Tried to communicate with them about my concerns and never heard back.  The gloves are not to keep your hands clean but to keep the food clean.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews i was skeptical of how good it could be but it lived up to very one of them. this place was great with a nice staff. i will be back many times seeing cuban is one if my favs. i got the chicken and a cuban sandwich they were unbelievable. dont pass this place up."}
{"text":"Coco tropical ..moist chicken, flavorful coconut rice, spicy pineapple chutney..I enjoyed it.  Also had the Pollo Loco.. Overall very good, but never having had this before, felt it needed a sauce or something.  It did have good flavor.  Loaded plantain chips... Great, but could have used some more guac.  Dessert...YUM!  Flan and tres leches were heaven!!      Happy we tried it out. Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and mojitos!!! Will definitely eat here again when we are in the area.  Service is excellent as well!!!!"}
{"text":"I see myself coming back here so often that I will probably need an intervention...   We had the Mofongo with Pernil (Pork) and it tasted fresh and flavorful. I love the way they serve the food in an aluminum tray that you could easily take to go. I thought the price good considering all the great food you get of Mofongo and pernil with a fresh salad. We decided to try the \"flan de queso\" which was amazing , same quality you get in the island! You have to buy the whole flan which is like $6 and it is great to eat some there and then take home the rest. They sell tres leches too but they didn't have any left... no wonder!  I wish they were not so far down Berea but I see myself making the drive there to try their other items. If you are looking for great latin food, give this guys a try!!"}
{"text":"When I know I'm going to be in the area I always make sure I have room for campus grille !!!! The employees are so kind and welcoming and the food is phenomenal! You really can't go wrong with what you order, my all time favorite though is the mofongo and I add the chicken to mine. Also the coco tropical (spicy), roasted pork shoulder and split rotisserie chicken are my other favorites. Don't be basic and order a quesadilla, you would just be passing up the opportunity to change your tastebuds for the rest of your life."}
{"text":"Yum! I have wanted to try this place for awhile and finally did. I wish I hadn't waited so long! It was delicious, maybe be the best pork I have ever had. I can't wait to go back and try more. I wanted the guacamole and plantains to go, but I was so full I couldn't even think about it."}
{"text":"What a gem.  When you walk in you are quickly greeted by a sweet lady (owner?).  The place smells fantastic, and there a few daily lunch specials I've tried that are a great deal. The pulled chicken with salsa, and rice was very good.  I've also had a wrap, and the guacamole, which is good, but about the size Chipotle gives you for $8?   A bit too high on that one, but everything else is very fair.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Incredible food and people working. Try the farmer's plate/the farmer's son and the Mofongo. Mofongo is amazing but pretty heavy - maybe share two dishes (including a Mofongo) between two or three people."}
{"text":"Every single time (and there have been many) I have lunch at Campus Grille...they hit it out of the park!  This has become a regular stop for me and many of my coworkers.  My favorite?...the pork, rice and beans lunch special.  It is a HUGE mound of food served in a pie tin.  The shredded pork is clearly slow cooked and full of subtle flavors.  The yellow rice is perfectly soft and moist, topped with a generous helping of beans that are soft and full of spiced flavors.  Our \"go to\" topping is the Goya hot sauce...slathered on top of all of the above in copious amounts (sorry you guys keep having to buy more because of us!) ;-)  Sometimes we get an individual parfait-style flan or an entire tin of flan that we share amongst our group.  Either way, they are creamy and not overly sweet...a perfect ending to an ALWAYS great meal.  Keep doing what you're doing team...we'll see 'ya soon!!!"}
{"text":"This place is dynamite! I had the pork shoulder with Latin rice and stewed beans. Generally not something I would order...so glad I did! Pork melts on mouth, very jucy with a good amount of flavor and saltiness to it. The beans and rice were also well prepared and absorbed the sauce from the pork perfectly. Next time I am in town I will return."}
{"text":"Friendly owners, great food, great location near downtown Berea. Can't really ask for much more. Some of the dinner items can feel a tad bit pricey, but I'm always there for lunch. 6 dollars for lunch versions of some of the most popular dinner items. I could honestly eat their pork and beans every day and it wouldn't get old. If only I could get the recipe!"}
{"text":"Got carry-out while working with my team today. Pretty unimpressed. The chicken in my quesdilla didn't seem fully cooked (pink in spots). Food was extremely greasy, and not in the sort of enjoyable debauchery way. PIneapple tomatillo sauce was ok, but a bit bland.  Coworkers were equally non-plussed by the rotisserie chicken and the Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous! Are you looking for an authentic Latin experience? Then this is the place! The half chicken with rice and beans is amazing! The rice and beans are just how my mother used to make them! They also have a variety of sweet potato empanadas! Ground beef, chicken, or pork. I have tried both ground beef and chicken and the beef is my personal favorite. They also have Cuban sandwiches and select menu items that are daily specials! The flan is amazing here and it's so big it will last you a week, so grab one to share with the family or your bff!"}
{"text":"Come when you're in Cleveland for interviewing for Global Entry  Since I know I will only get Elite '19 if I write up my thoughts of restaurants overseas, I drove four hours today to spend 10 minutes interviewing for the Global Entry program in Middleburg Heights.  But the Campus Grille made that the time and gas spent a bit more worth it.  Not much in the way of Puerto Rican food in Columbus, so I ordered a lot: mofongo with carne guisada (beef stew); roast pork shoulder over rice and pinto beans; a cubano sandwich; plantanos maduros (sweet plantains).  I'm no mofongo expert, but my PR friends are and it seems like it wasunderseasoned, possibly lacking in lard/bacon.  Most of the flavor from the mofongo came from the carne guisada, which was quite good and I would've just preferred to have that over rice, especially given the cost of the mofongo.  Pork shoulder was delicious, which made both the pork/rice and the cubano taste very good, though I thought the cubano would've benefited from crustier bread.  Plantanos maduros was great, with no astringent taste usually associated with under-ripe plantains.  Service was really great; the manager accommodated my requests to delay bagging my takeout orders so I could photograph them in a restaurant setting, and then returned after I had finished shooting to lid and bag them.  Really thoughtful of her and I really appreciated it.  Prices aren't exorbitant, but they're not the student dive/bargain that the restaurant's name would lead you to believe.  The lunch specials are a good deal and recommended.  The mofongo is generously portioned, but also twice the cost of the lunch specials, so if you already know you don't care for mofongo, I'd save the money and just get the lunch special instead."}
{"text":"I decided to try the grille since it's on my way home from work.I stopped in a little after five and there was a good amount of people there but it wasn't crowded. I ordered the rotisserie chicken with cilantro lime rice and beans, pulled pork with yellow rice and beans and the chicken quesadillas and sweet cornbread as takeout. The woman taking my order was very friendly and the food was ready to go in no time at all. First off, I want to say I was anxious to try the food since reading all the reviews about how great and different the meals were. The chicken quesadillas were huge and a meal by themselves, more than an half inch thick, and loaded with chicken but unfortunately the cheese was overpowering. I would've preferred a more perfect balance since you could barely taste the red peppers and caramelized onions. The rotisserie chicken dinner with the cilantro rice was plentiful and good but they gave me the red beans instead of the dark beans which I had ordered and pulled pork dinner was just OK being that the pork was somewhat dry. The cornbread was sweet and delicious! The place was truly authentic and the takeout service was very good but over all the food  was pretty average and I guess I expected more after reading a lot of the recent reviews. I might return in the future and try one of the dishes that include the Mofongo."}
{"text":"very good and inexpensive. Danielle and i had lunch here on Saturday and got so much food neither of us was able to leave without a doggie bag.   I had the roasted pork shoulder w/ beans and rice and Danielle got the Cuban sandwich. Both were delicious. The pork was tender and succulent and i love rice and beans."}
{"text":"My first visit made me decide that I'll definitely go back. It's easy to order at the counter, have a seat and they bring your order to you. We split an order of the half chicken with rice and beans. Perfect for my gluten free/dairy free dietary needs. Delicious too! The chicken was very moist. The black beans were vegetarian. My spouse chose a cola from the cooler and our total bill was only about $10 which left us both happy and full."}
{"text":"Really good!! Tried the mofongo and almost thought I was in PR.  Tried the tostones but I'm used to sweet ripened plantains so these were not my fave.  Will go back to more dishes.  I live less than 5 minutes away and can't believe I've slept on this place!"}
{"text":"This was my second trip here. The menu is simple, and there are usually some specials posted near the register, but this place does a handful of things and they do them all very well. I got the pork shoulder with rice and beans and it was very good, especially with the vinegar based house made hot sauce they have at the tables. My wife got a quesadilla and we split an empanadilla and plantain chips with guacamole. It was all good, with the empanadilla being exceptional. I'll definitely be getting the mofongo when I go back."}
{"text":"Awesome pork shoulder dinner. I will defiantly be returning to try more of the deliciousness coming out of this kitchen. Pricing appears to be of good value upon this first visit. Thanks for the hospitality"}
{"text":"This place lacks basic logic on every level. After waiting in line for about 15 minutes to order we had to be rushed at the counter since their menu board doesn't explain what any of the dishes are. While I'm fairly familiar with latin dishes, some of my family members aren't and had to figure things out at the last second while being rushed.  They then charged us for drinks they didn't even have in stock? We had to wait in line AGAIN to get a refund. Ridiculous. The bartender copped an attitude with my disabled mother instead of apologizing.  They eventually brought the food and didn't bring silverware with it? Apparently, they can't just grab silverware on their way to your table, you have to walk back to the front to get everything that they just could have brought to you. While the chicken was good, the rice was bland and the pineapple tasted like it was out of a can. I live in NYC and have great latin food all around my neighborhood. Maybe this is good for Ohio standards, but it's a total amateur operation."}
{"text":"Great fresh food! A must try if you're looking for authentic Puerto Rican food. Prices are great as well. A must try for sure!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So, when friends say \"Hey, let's go to BEREA for some great food,\" I got interested.  The Campus Grille is in a small corner of a big square, and is a real no-nonsense set up. You order, you pick a drink from the cooler, and you sit, awaiting the tasty stuff. And yes, it was tasty. Really crispy, wonderful empanadas, spicy chicken and a host of other amazing, freshly made foods await. The staff, (the place is family owned,) are thoughtful and the owner was quick with a joke and any answers to questions you might have.  Parking is small, and the cost is too, but I only have one complaint... I WISH THEY WERE CLOSER TO MY HOUSE!!  Anyway, even if you're not a student, this Campus Grille is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"My wife and I can't get enough of this place! The food is authentic and I love me some pork Mofongo. You have to go to Campus Grille Latin, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"First time there today for an early dinner and it did not disappoint. Had the pork shoulder with rice and beans -- generous portion and tasty. The service was pleasant and made us feel welcome. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I've only been to Campus Grille once, but the owners were so nice I need to make a return trip.  Honestly, I visited a while ago & I cannot recall what I ordered, but I know I liked it.  I do recall the home-made fresh mango guac that was de-lish!!!  They did a great job refurbishing the place.  It is clean and there is some eat-in dining space. Campus Grille keeps some SERIOUS late hours for those on campus so it is great for carry out!   If you're in Berea, check out Campus Grille!"}
{"text":"4.5!! Heard about this place word of mouth from my friends who are really active in the local food scene. There's a pretty solid Puerto Rican community in Cleveland and I feel as if I'm just starting to know where to go for Puerto Rican food. (Gave the place in Gordon Square a few tries, but I likely won't be back.)  This restaurant is located outside of the city in Berea, close to Baldwin Wallace college. They have a fresh logo and have all the goods tech wise (including belly points and tablets.)   The food was flavorful and PLENTIFUL. One order of the mofongo ($8.59, fried plantains with garlic and chiccarones mashed over juicy pork) will go a long way. Most of our friends were able to make 2 portions out of it, and for me, I was able to get 3 since I don't eat as much meat in one sitting. What I enjoyed most was the flavor and how the juicy pork mixed with the fried plantain/garlic flavor.   The hubs was able to polish off the chicken, rice, and beans, (which he really liked) but he had to take a break. I would say you could split that into 2 portions too.   Our group also ordered a few orders of the chips and guacamole, which are fried plantains with house made guacamole. That is also pretty filling! Both had great flavor.  Finally, they serve up giant empanadillas, about $2 each. They have several meat options, but we opted for the \"Dessert\" ones - sweet potato empanadillas, covered in a thin layer of sugar. That and a jarrito (soda) was a great finish to our meal.  The owner came over and checked in on us - great service and friendly guys. I hope they continue to do well.  We definitely over-ordered our first time there, but I definitely got a good sense of the food. It is really good, and worth taking a visit to. The only downside is that it's pretty far from the city."}
{"text":"Why is this place not packed to the edges? This food is good. I had a mojito (better than the ala izquierda) and chicken with coconut rice   Delicious. Chicken done perfectly with rice just so and I am real picky about rice."}
{"text":"The pork shoulder was the dish that was recommended. Delicious! Also had an order of tostones with Mango guac and a Cuban. I told my kids that I'd pick this anytime over Chipotle. That agreed...and they love Chipotle. My 4 kids split 2 pork shoulder dishes."}
{"text":"Mom tipped me off to this place. Came from Columbus because I miss home cooked Latin food and it was so damn good, fresh, tasty Latin food with large portions! Friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"Hello Mofongo, my sweet, garlicky love!  Nice staff and killer food.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Who knew I love plaintains so much?! This place has great food that I've never had elsewhere. I got the loaded plantains. Yum."}
{"text":"I had the Cuban sandwich. Bread... Good, pork....good, mustard....good. Mac salad....good. Go there. Eat the food.   Oh ya. I also had some fried dessert things. One with apples and one sweet potato filling both were yummy"}
{"text":"The food is great! I recommend the specials. The staff are always warm and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Awesome foods and people. Better than the foods we had when we visited Puerto Rico two months back."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Small casual family owned place. Owners are very friendly and welcoming.  I've tried everything on the menu and love it all. Portions are very big. I go there often and food is always fresh and delicious. Let me tell you those empanadas are something else.  Did I tell you I love this place!!! Absolutely must visit"}
{"text":"Love this place, friendly and the food is great. The pork shoulder is some of the best I have had."}
{"text":"Tried a little bit of everything and it was all soooo good - Mofongo (a must), empandillas, guacamole, Cubanc pollo loco,..."}
{"text":"I had the Cuban sandwich and it was incredible. Campus Grill is a little unexpected hidden gem."}
{"text":"Awesome new discovery right by BW. Excellent Latin food. Had mofongos and empanadillas. To my surprise for a college eatery, food was very well prepared and very tasty. Great presentation, too. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Will be back again to try their other entrees."}
{"text":"The food seemed to lack favor honestly don't understand how they are so popular maybe I went on a bad day"}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem. Amazing food. Casual atmosphere where you can linger with family/friends."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is fabulous. The people are friendly. We regularly did take out for lunches at work from Campus Grille. It's the ONLY place where EVERY ONE in the office ordered from the same place and all dieters threw watching calories out the window for the day. Not much seating in this place and if you don't know Berea, it's slightly difficult to find. (It's where the old Pizza King was located.) But don't let this stop you. I have several Puerto Rican friends who swear by this place saying it's as close to their mother's cooking as it gets without going home. I have the most picky, annoying eating children on Earth. Even THEY love the food here. Do yourself the favor and stop in soon!"}
{"text":"Omg, my suggested is to go there and eat lol   I enjoyed the everything I ate. It's nothing like Mexican at all. Porto Rican food is more about seasoning and flavor then spice I think.   I got the plantain chips vegetarian style.... delicious   The mofongo is so good and their most popular dish."}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant in Berea. The food is always fresh, the owners are warm and welcoming, and the food is reasonably priced, especially for the lunch specials.   Coco Tropical, guac and plantain chips, and apple empanadas are a can't miss meal!"}
{"text":"Mofongo as much fun to say as it is to eat. Each order of Mofongo is made to order in a traditional wooden pilón, with mashed plantains, flavored with plenty of garlic, olive oil and chicharrón, and mine was stuffed with the most delicious, succulent pork imaginable.  All I got to say is yummy!!! They also had several different kinds of empanadas, I  tried the beef, which I thought was ok, but I felt was lacking flavor and seasoning compared to the other food that I had.  Absolutely worth a trip, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This food is amazing. Can't tell from the name but it is Latin food (their description). If you are from the Berea/Brookpark area, then you know it as the old Pizza King. This couldn't be more different from Pizza King. I live in Avon now, and find myself in Berea about every 2 months. My kids beg me to stop at Campus Grille and bring home the plantains for them. They are out of this world. They come with a pineapple-laced guacamole. If you like spicy food, I highly recommend the jalapeno cornbread. Never had a spicy cornbread that somehow managed the sweet and moist texture of a great cornbread followed by the kick of the jalapeno. We will get to Berea on a non-school day to actually eat in one of these days. Staff is super friendly. Tip: I bring the plantains home, so they do get soggy. Reheat at 450 degrees for 5 minutes and they are as crisp and fresh as if you were eating them in the restaurant."}
{"text":"amazing! who knew a place with the name the campus grill would offer classic puerto rican food at its very best! loved the pork, the mofongo and the peeps!  ps. the tres leches was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Seriously my new favorite eats in Berea. The food is so good. We love the pork shoulder and pollo loco. My 2 year old can't get enough of the rice and beans. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here once and am looking forward to returning. Don't make the newbie mistake we made by taking a seat in the dining area; instead, order at the counter and then take a seat! There were five of us and we wanted to sample a variety of items. We got the Carribean quac, a Cuban, an empanada, a quesadilla and a veggie platter. We each had a soda and our order was only $50! Plus, I feel like we over ordered and took home left overs! Everything was really good but I think the Cuban took first place with me. The pork was so freakin' good! The pork alone was worth the 40-minute drive! I recommend ordering a few different items and sharing them family style, although it was difficult to divvy things up in baskets with plastic silverware.  The parking lot was small and a little confusing but we hit it at just the right time and lucked out."}
{"text":"Based on the Yelp reviews, I have been trying to get over and try Campus Grille for a while; I had a hankering for some Mofungo so I hopped on the motorcycle and headed to the West Side.  The Grille is tucked into a corner of Berea, not too far from Baldwin Wallace.  Walking in from the parking lot you find a small front dining room, the service line and a larger dining area.  You place your order and pay, choose a table and they bring the food out to you.  The decor is simple, but they keep the place up nicely.  Service was friendly and helpful, the cashier answered all of my questions.  I ordered the Mofungo con Bacalao Guisado, the mashed plantains with salted cod, onions and peppers.  Be aware the Mofungo comes with pork cracklings, unless you request otherwise, as I did.  The large order came out quickly, served in an aluminum takeout container.   The plantains were good, but not as mashed as I have had before; more like chunks with some crispier parts.  The fish was pleasant, but not as flavorful as I was expecting.  Overall the dish was nice, just a bit disappointing compared to the Mofungo I have previously had.  I was also disappointed that I could not get a cup of water, they did offer to sell me a bottle of water but I find it hard to believe that a restaurant does not provide cups of water.    Overall I though Campus Grille was OK, just not something special enough to go back to.  Of course I only tried one item, so your experience may be different."}
{"text":"Mom and pops Latino at it's best.  I love this home town favorite, you can never go wrong with any item. Always fresh daily and home made by a couple who care."}
{"text":"What a surprise! From the name on the sign I expected hotdogs and hamburgers. When you get closer you see \"Latin\" on the sign too. Couldn't have been happier to find it.   Had the Cuban and loved it. The roasted pork was so good. It came with a little side of macaroni salad of some sort which I liked too. They have a ton of Jarritos and Goya sodas, nectars, and juices too. Cuban sammy + pineapple soda = great lunch.   Great service topped it off. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Mofongo is absolutely amazing, as is the side salad, but I found the portion size to be so misleading! It doesn't look like much, but there is no space at all underneath that dome surface of fried plantain. It's fully filled with plantain and pork, and even more so if you get another meat like chicken to go with it. The whole thing is very tasty, although the flavor got a bit monotonous toward the end so I appreciated having the salad to add in some variety. The chicken that was included was tender, and I probably would've preferred the mofongo to be a bit less dry and starchy. Still, it probably doesn't get more authentic than this."}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming. The restaurant itself is very clean. They had some old school R&B jams on the speakers which took me back to my high school years. And the food, oh the food.  The mofongo is incredible. This was my first time having mofongo so I didn't really have anything to compare it to, but it was amazing. Mashed up plantains with bits of pork rind and fried garlic, stuffed with your choice of meat. Full of greasy, garlicky, delicious flavor, plus it was huge so it turned into two meals. I had the pork filling, which had great flavor but just a little salty. Also tried a couple of empanadillas (beef/potato, chicken), which were also pretty good.  I love everything about this place and will definitely return."}
{"text":"A secret latin place to eat in Berea.  Who would have thought?  This is a casual spot for great food and the service is fast.  Be prepared as there is no waiter service.  You walk up to the counter to place your order, grab your own utensils at the bar and get your own drink from the cooler.  It is well worth it.  The pork I had was killer tender and the rice and beans well flavored.  This is not Cuban cooking so don't expect black beans but the beans were excellent.  My wife also had the pork and neither one of us could finish our portions.  I had a beer and you may have to remind someone to get you your beer.  Lots of locals and if there is a line, it moves fast.  Definitely a place to return to.  I give it 5 stars due to flavor of the food which is excellent and traditional, and the cost which was exceptional.  We even ordered takeout to eat later in the form of a cubano..."}
{"text":"Good food. Morbidly obese portions. Just but one plate for two adults. Staff is friendly and the environment is clean and comfortable. Nothing crazy original so it's not a five cause it was pretty typical food I felt I could find but it is a solid place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have loved everything I've tried! The Cuban is phenomenal. The pork empanadilla was so good I cannot wait to try more fillings. Coco Tropical and Loaded Plantains were tasty, but the Cuban and empanadilla are the best!  Highly recommend and will be returning!"}
{"text":"The coco tropical was not good - 1/10 I have had it in the past when they serviced it as a rotisserie chicken - Not this time - it looked like chunky portions of chicken thighs in coconut watered flavor- The lady at the counter was rather arrogant - I kindly asked - is lunch your busiest  time of the day ? ( just small talk) And she replied nasty - I is always the busiest    Time of the day - Mean and nasty - Never again -"}
{"text":"One of our favorites in the area. The food is reasonably priced. It's different in the sense of not serving a typical burrito .  They have the best cream cheese flan I have ever had!"}
{"text":"MY GUY. The mofongo here is really on point, the roasted pork is so flavorful and well cooked. I also had the flan con queso with blueberries and it was so smooth and might be the best flan I've had. Deadass b, this might be the best Puerto Rican restaurant in Ohio. Also go Mets, Yankees ain't nothing my G."}
{"text":"oh emmm geee!  loved the food.  ok, so the ambience is a little less than desirable (looks sort of like an old dairy mart store on the inside, maybe?!) very small and not many tables.......but want carry out, with extremely authentic food and amazing taste? then definitely try this place out. i ventured here on a busy saturday night and got carry out. i was NOT disappointed. the food was delicious! prices are great!  recommend to anyone wanting some yummy latin food! i will definitely go back......my tongue is salivating thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Second time here, this place is really really good!  The Latin Music, the FRESH AUTHENTIC FOOD, the friendly cook staff and the excellent prices will quickly make this a success.  The first time we visited, we ordered empanadas, one of each, pork, chicken and ground beef, very tasty, perfectly fried.  Today we ordered a Cuban Sandwich and a pork quesadilla, both are awesome!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"WOW !!!!! Let me first start off by saying that my expectations of this place were set relatively low. Coming from a Puerto Rican family where my mom and grandma are just awesome cooks ( yes I'm biased,  but who wouldn't be?) that's to be expected.  Secondly if you have yet to try MOFONGO,  what the h-e double hockey sticks are you waiting for?  The MOFONGO here is just awesome and so is there chicken and their empanadillas. If you're just in the mood for guacamole and chips, go for it, you'll be happy you did. The staff is all very friendly. Honestly I have nothing bad to say about this place (that's pretty rare in itself). I was born and raised in  Philadelphia and I've been to a few places out here that specialize in this cuisine and they pale in comparison. So, what are you waiting for,  get over there soon and enjoy."}
{"text":"The Campus Grille was a pleasant surprise! An authentic Latin American restaurant tucked away in Berea, who would've guessed?!  My family and I decided to go there for lunch the other day, but I wish we had gone for dinner because the portions are that generous!  My dad and I both ordered the pork mofongo, my mom ordered the pork shoulder, and my sister ordered the split chicken. We also ordered the plantain and guacamole for an appetizer.  The mofongo was delicious and came with a side salad.  My dad even loved it, and coming from someone who grew up in Puerto Rico that means a lot.  And don't be fooled by the pictures, the mofongo is pretty big!  My mom's pulled pork was delicious, and came with rice and beans.  My sister's split chicken was pretty good too.  The plantains we got were amazing, and just like the kind my mom makes at home.  Plus the guacamole (with pieces of mango in it), was awesome.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! I most often get the mofongo with pork, but I've tried a number of their entrees and lunches, and I've not yet been disappointed - especially because I make a point of getting the plantain chips with guacamole! I've even managed to get folks from work who usually never want to go out to lunch to join me here because of how great the plantain chips are."}
{"text":"Went out looking for something different. Stopped in for some Spanish food. The people were friendly. Welcoming, clean environment and good prices but for me the food was just o.k. The pork tasted old and all the food had a heavy garlic flavor."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic and freshly made. Staff was courteous and quick. Decent selection and a great price."}
{"text":"Taking over the previous Pizza King location, Campus Grille offers Puerto Rican food in an area that never really has been exposed to the cuisine. Campus Grille has many fresh options. May favorite is the farmer's plate, which has delicious rice, black beans, crunchy plantains, and a terrific citrus dressing.   I have been back several times to Campus Grille and I'll likely be back again at some point."}
{"text":"I'm extremely picky about my Puerto Rican food, as any Puerto Rican is, because our moms and grandmothers spoiled us. And in that, I approach any restaurant with low expectations, because honestly, how could they compare to family cooking? Well, I'm happy to say, this place is AMAZING.  As soon as you walk through the door, you get treated like family. Your happiness is their main concern from minute one until you leave with your belly full. And you WILL leave with your belly full. A 40 chicken rotisserie, fresh ingredients, an amazing mango salad dressing, and the BEST mofongo I've had outside of the Island. Once you've scarfed all that down, finish it off with an apple or sweet potato empanadilla and you'll never want to leave.  They're everything I ask for in a restaurant. Fresh, friendly, family, flavorful, and unforgettable. Tell your friends, I know I will."}
{"text":"This place has some of the BEST food we have eaten!  Got take out. We ordered sweet potato, chicken and also the cheese empanadas, the plantains and the rice and beans.  It was all fabulous.  For sure, the best beans and rice I have ever had.  Everything was so flavorful!  Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"You will get plenty for your money. I had the coco tropical with pork - excellente! I love the spiciness of the rice with some sweetness from the pineapple. My boyfriend, who is Latino, stated that the food is well cooked with less grease than usual and he knows the owner who has stated that he wants to make the food healthier. This place is a solid establishment that I can't wait to see grow."}
{"text":"I went to the Campus Grille for the first time last week and was blown away! this is as authentic as it gets. Berea needed a restaurant like this. The owners were so friendly, and their food is so fresh and delicious. And my favorite part; they offer Jarritos Mexican Sodas! Love it!"}
{"text":"Got the pork with rice and beans (lunch special), and I was a little skeptical at first because I didn't think it would even come close to my full-blooded Puerto Rican mother's food, but I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. The pork was so tender, flavorful, and juicy. The rice and beans were absolutely everything I could have wanted. I'm sad I don't live in the area anymore or I would definitely be coming back frequently. I love this place, and am rooting for its success!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. My sister and I go around town to different restaurants in town each month and Campus Grille is terrific. We will be back to try additional dishes. We were all so pleased with the taste, quantity and price. YUMMY"}
{"text":"I had such a terribly rude experience that I am embarrassed that I recommended The Campus Grille.  I had two friends with me and we waited at the register for 10 minutes to place an order.  The cashier and other workers did not acknowledge us.  After 10 minutes of standing I went to the owner and he basically said too bad it is a busy Saturday night and showed us the door.  I own a restaurant and that is unheard of and unacceptable.  I felt invisible and obviously my money is not important to them.  They will not keep their customer base with their poor service and bad attitude.  Funny thing they used to be so nice.  I am shocked.  It is as if they became famous and don't need us."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked pork and chicken. Authentic Puerto Rican food. Only drawback: fake cheese on the Cuban (they call it Swiss, but it's white American). Kills the texture.  My friends and guests always enjoy the food."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in berea!! Some of the best food I've ever had. Ordered the shrimp mofongo and oh man was that delicious. I will say they do need to change the name of the place, for when you think of a campus grille you think of school cafeteria food and that's not the case here."}
{"text":"Stopped in based solely on Yelp reviews, and wasn't disappointed. If you're looking for fancy, keep looking. If you're looking for delicious food, great prices and extremely friendly people, go to the Campus Grille. Started with a pork empanadilla followed by a Cuban sandwich. Both were perfectly prepared and served hot. The only 'meh' was the macaroni salad that is served as a side, so we ordered some fried plantains and that more than made up for it. Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Hey sorry that I am not Latin, But making my wife feel like an asshole because she asked if flan is like pudding,or what is it like? And if I asked what the non marked bottle of yellow liquid on the table is and you say hot sauce, but there is a bottle of clearly marked hot sauce already at my table, and I hear the big guy say its a cure for cancer is not what I was expecting when I walked in.  To the 2 fat fucks that get off on making people feel like assholes when they are there trying to keep business in the neighborhood, I invite you to a local German or Polish restaurant on me! Cant wait to make you feel like the true asshole you are!!! AND FYI you are using to much salt on your pork!"}
{"text":"Disappointed that Yelp told us that the restaurant closed at 9PM but the restaurant advertised on the door that they close at 8PM on Sundays.  I had called to verify the closing time and was told between 7:30-8PM.  When we arrived at 7:08PM, we were turned away and told they were CLOSED!!  Can't comment on the food that we didn't have a chance to try!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I ate here for lunch on a Friday afternoon.  From the moment we walked in we knew we found a gem.  The delicious Spanish smell, the fun Latin music, the Goya products everywhere; everything was as it should be when going to a Spanish establishment.  There was various items to order from - each of us enjoyed our selections and wanted more - but we were already full.  We traveled 2 hours from Western PA to try this food and we were not disappointed.  They sell shirts, we got those too."}
{"text":"On Seminary Street.  Comes up quickly and you will pass by it the time you get to the Post Office.   I am giving 5 stars for the effort here and what the owner brings to Berea.  Definitely different from the standard bar fare.  I wanted to really love it, but the verdict is still out on more stars.  I am giving 3 1/2.   I got the pork, rice and beans tin.  Good quantity but the pork had a taste or seasoning I was not used to. This is what I am saying it might have been.  Otherwise, just a strange aftertaste.  Wish I had opted for chicken.  I put on some hot sauce to drown the aftertaste a little.   The rice and beans are the strong suit here.  Moist with added potatoes and green olives for additional flavor.   By far my favorite part of the meal.  Plantains are plentiful but made thickly.  The guacamole on the side is a good touch.   Chunky style.     I liked the empanada crust but was not stuffed enough.  I got the chicken variety.   No desert this time.   Plenty of colorful soft drinks and a bar for mixed drinks within.   Order and sit down style.    I will most likely give it another shot."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for a while. We stopped in the other night for some guacamole. The atmosphere was awesome, fun music and enthusiastic staff!! Instead of chips the guac comes with fried plantains. I loved the plantains and would rather eat them plain! After leaving we knew we had to come back to try actual meals.   Fast forward to the next day (seriously, we were that excited to go back). The same awesome employees greeted us. We tried the split chicken meal with rice and beans ( it reminded me of the Latin food I used to live off of in NYC) and the grilled chicken salad wrap. The wrap envied the size of a chipotle burrito! We also tried a beef empanada and it was a standout. All that for under $20 with servings that are guaranteed to turn into leftovers.   Eat in their bright dining area or take your food to the nearby park. This is the kind of local joint I have no problem giving my $$ to!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal! It's like a little piece of Puerto Rico right here is Berea! You have to try the mofongo!!! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here due to the great reviews. The pork was pretty good! The rice was average. My boyfriend got the chicken and he loved it. The empanadas were great. I would definitely return although it was nothing amazing."}
{"text":"My first trip was during the week. I was able to get the Coco Tropical as a lunch special. It was delicious! I really liked mixing up the shredded chicken with the rice, and the chutney too. (That helped cut the hotness of the chutney. It's awesome, but I'm not good with the heat!)  Had to take a return trip this past weekend. I got the Coco Tropical again, but the dinner portion. It came with a split rotisserie chicken breast. The chicken was delicious, as was everything else. If I had my choice, I'd pick the shredded chicken over the split, if only because it's less work, less messy, less food, and less $$. But it's a great bang for the buck, either way. I can't wait to go back again! I don't work near there anymore, so I can't get the lunch special, but I'm ok with that!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent but a little overpriced overall my experience was great and the food was prepared pretty fast. The atmosphere was wonderful and the people were very nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in again with the whole family, including my parents.  The remodel is complete and it was just in time. The place used to be so small that there were hardly any seats for the droves of customers. They easily doubled the amount of space and I love it. We were able to get seated and served rather quickly. I don't think this place can get any better.  Love."}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! Such a great staff very welcoming, clean, great music. Hidden GEM!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for some good PR food. About $9 buys a big meal (enough for me to have two lunches). Food is delicious, service was great, and restaurant is clean and comfortable. Cleveland area needs more places to eat like Campus Grille!"}
{"text":"I love campus grill!! They are super fast and nice. I always go there when it era too late to cook, because of  work. The only problem is they close too early!! (At 8:30 to be exact) You should close later people!! Your food it's too good!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service and music.  Authentic Latin/Peurto Rican food.  Fresh, tasty, delicious.  They strive to please.  Full bar, and great music.  This place is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Incredible food and the owners are truly the sweetest people. After going to BW for four years and eating here regularly, I can't recommend this place enough"}
{"text":"The food was great!!. I'm so glad I found a good latin spot.I've been searching for so long !"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the staff is extremely friendly and a pleasure to interact with. Mofongo is a great dish. It comes with a small salad and a nice little Puerto Rican flag atop the finished product. The pork shoulder is everything one could want out of a piece of pork shoulder. The empanadillas are nice appetizers. The Cuban is a great sandwich. I was not disappointed with the lack of pickles and thought it tasted fine without them. The portions are generous and it was hard for me to finish. This worked out well because it turned into lunch and dinner. I got two birds stoned as they say. Campus Grille is a nice alternative to Rincon Criollo or Caribe and a welcome change up for Berea."}
{"text":"Wow - best mofongo I have had since Puerto Rico. The Cubano sandwich was insane, the shredded pork had this garlic component - amazing. Went with my 3 kids, and the server was so sweet to them (and they loved the food as much as I did!) I will be back.  Thank you for such an enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  It's been a while since I've eaten here and they have grown.  They have a nice large dining room now full of TVs and a bar.  They still have Latin music playing overhead which I like.  So now they have an open and large space.  What really shines here is the food.  I split a pork shoulder dinner with my oldest daughter now 11.  With chips and guacamole.  You order at a counter and they bring it out to your table when its ready.  The chips are homemade plantain chips.  They are large slices of plaintain that are smashed and fried.  The guacamole has passion fruit mixed into it.  It's not overdone and just right.  You get a huge portion of pork shoulder with beans and rice.  I picked out a bay leaf while I was eating.  I'm ok with that.  There are layers of flavors in the meat.  The sides are some of the most flavorful sides I've ever had.  I'd eat here all the time if it were closer to home.  So so good.  On a previous visit I had a Monfongo.  Basically it's pork shoulder with rice packed on top.  It makes a huge ball and its also very delicious.  I noticed the desserts in the cooler where the latin inspired drinks were.  I like the coconut soda.  Its different.  But the flan in the cooler caught my eye.  I asked where they got the flan from.  Guy pointed to the nice lady cracking eggs into a kitchen aid mixer and said she is actually making more right now.  This place makes everything fresh and from scratch.  It shows.  The food is awesome."}
{"text":"Can you say good coma. I come here and get a farmer junior which is a half sized vegetarian meal. This makes 2:00 pm very hard. The food is absolutely amazing. The staff is awesome and very attentive. And it takes almost no time to begin you feast after walking in the door.   100% recommend to all in the area for a good inexpensive meal alone, with a friend or with family."}
{"text":"Great Friendly Staff! A different style of food for me but I loved the flavor. I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"El sabor! I think it says a lot that my second visit to The Campus Grille was three days after my first visit...and I'm a 40 minute drive away. On my first trip, we ordered the carne guisado mofongo, a Cuban sandwich, and two empanadillas (ground beef/guava with cream cheese). We picked up a tres leches cake and a sangria soda to go after eating there for the first time. After reading some reviews, we decided on our second trip to try the shrimp mofongo along with another order of the carne guisado mofongo and some sweet corn bread.  The mofongo...I've never had mofongo this good before. I was hooked after the first bite. The savory combination of plantain, garlic, and chicharrones is just outstanding. Each order is made fresh and served piping hot. Both the carne guisado and shrimp were bursting with flavor, although I think the shrimp ended up as my favorite in the end. I'm still trying to figure out how they pack so much flavor into these dishes. This is better than any other comfort food I've ever had.  The Cuban...the pork was tender, moist, and flavorful, and the bread had a nice, crisp exterior. My favorite bites were those with a hefty dose of mustard. The pickle is served on the side of the sandwich here and I kind of missed it being inside of the sandwich, but it was easy enough to eat them together.  Everything else...the empanadillas were crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. The guava and cream cheese was a new and tasty combination for me. The tres leches cake, which my family devoured for dessert that night, was moist, sweet, and creamy.  Literally my only complaint about The Campus Grille is that the bottom of the sweet corn bread was burned...and yet we all still ate it because it still tasted good!  You can tell the gentlemen in the kitchen work their tails off, as everything is made right before your eyes. The employees at The Campus Grille are really friendly and helpful, the kind of people you wish you could buy a round of beers. This place has a really good thing going."}
{"text":"The best place for lunch in Berea! The roast pork shoulder is so flavorful and tender, the Spanish rice and beans are bomb! The portions are nice and generous, I could make a few meals out of one. and the prices are unbeatable! I have not tried the Mofongo, but I seen someone's order for it and it looks amazing! I will definitely try that next time!"}
