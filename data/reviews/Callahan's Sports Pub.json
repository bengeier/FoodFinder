{"text":"I was in Madison this past weekend visiting family. My cousins wanted to catch the Pats game so we came here cause it was apparently my cousins favorite sports bar. I'm not much into sports but it was a really fun bonding experience and this place has a bunch of TVs to get all the games in. They also have a really great beer selection, I especially like the capital Wisconsin amber. Overall, I had a blast and the food was good too. If I was into sports I'd for sure comeback but I'm not so I'd probably only come back if my cousins go."}
{"text":"I had absolutely great service from our bartender, Daniel, tonight.  He engaged his whole bar in conversation and made it feel like he was hosting a party I would recommend checking out this bar on Wednesday nights based on his service alone."}
{"text":"We went here to be able to watch the Bears game and the Packers game one sunday. They found us a seat and made sure we could see both games. The food was decent and the service was ok. It is a good place to go if you want to watch multiple games at once. I wouldn't go there all the time and it won't become my favorite hangout but I'd go back."}
{"text":"Clientele are old rigid couples not a very inviting atmosphere food and drink are mediocre."}
{"text":"Summer volleyball is great here. Good atmosphere awesome staff. Food and drinks are a little pricey but still delicious. Fun place to relax with friends."}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon for this place.  The service was excellent and the deluxe prime rib sandwich and the chipolte burger were fantastic.  You can bet we will visit again wifalsethout"}
{"text":"Lower-end sports bar. Not a bad place for a happy hour after work. The usual bar food, beer and cornhole. No frills at this place. Ask for Amanda as your server; she's hilarious! Definitely made for great conversation.

I ordered the Chicken Nachos, which was ok. They didn't skimp on the abundance of shredded chicken, so it was even on the amount of nachos. (Don't you hate it when you get more nachos than meat and toppings?)"}
{"text":"Having just completed summer volleyball season here, I have mixed feelings about this place.  Sure, it's a sports bar and vball players track in tons of sand, but the bathrooms are disgusting- not just sandy, but smelling of sewer and always wet and dirty. Drinks are OK, prices vary wildly during the same evening, and the service is often inexplicably slow. There is one server who is really on her game- Callie, I think is her name- remembers who drinks what and comes by frequently.  She's great, but even still, our tabs are often wrong at the end of the evening, which is just a little more hassle than the place is worth."}
{"text":"I attended a going away party here recently and it was not the best venue. The place smelled like a fryer, the bathroom stalls were dirty and out of order, the dart tips were all bent/broken/missing. There was a bar fight very early in the night. Just not the place for me. I do think the staff was very friendly and the customer service was good...well priced beverages."}
{"text":"They're super dog friendly, and let us bring our well behaved pups out on the patio area in the sand volleyball courts. 

Gina the general manager is so nice and sweet. We'll definitely add this to our list of places to go when the weather is pleasant!"}
{"text":"The Sports Pub is the kind of place I tend to find myself at when I get overruled by my friends on the east side.  I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a bad impression of the place.  

The first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.

The menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath."}
{"text":"Had fish fry there last night walleye was unbelievable and my wife really liked her baked cod too. Outside was fun watching volleyball while eating on a nice night.. Just  moved to madison  about 8 mths ago. will be back waitress was friendly and didn't have to wait for drinks. Better fish fry then avenue."}
{"text":"They do a good turkey club I will say that much. Hit the spot for me and I am a picky sandwich guy. The salad bar is not half bad either for just $3 more. Great spot to grab a lunch on the east side for cheap or catch the game I am sure based on the looks of the place. I'd visit more often but being here in San Diego might make that a bit tough...."}
{"text":"Visited last Saturday evening and nothing was \"good\".  Drinks were sub-par and no, not because there wasn't enough booze, because bitters shouldn't be used by the spoonful.  The food was very meh....4 people dined.  Patty melt was ok, Greek burger would have been ok...but who the heck puts olives WITH pits on a burger???  The server happened to check on us right after the pit was bit into and when my friend mentioned to the server that he was just trying to figure out if he cracked a tooth from the pits...she laughed and went \"yeah\".  The potato skins were so dried out they were mostly inedible.  The fries never saw a grain of salt...or any seasoning for that matter.  Our server was nice but kept forgetting about us or had way too many tables.  We waited forever for food because \"the kitchen was backed up\" but the place wasn't even full.  Had to get our own silverware, napkins and ketchup....you served coleslaw and french fries to us???"}
{"text":"This is one of my traditional stops when departing from Dane County airport. Food is average. A decent tenderloin steak sandwich would have been greatly improved with a \"bun upgrade\" from a basic hamburger bun to something \"hard rolly or French\". Service on the other hand by Todd was again good , very friendly and attentive! For what it is,an enjoyable place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Cheese curds great, pork burger alot of fat chunks, a small place and cheap food prices, pool and music."}
{"text":"Came in on quiet night before the holidays, we were the only ones ordering food. Suffice to say service was slow, meals were either overcooked or served cold, screwed up pizza order. Guests from out of town were not happy with anything that transpired"}
{"text":"this place is truly awful. the sole reason I come here is to play volleyball... their outdoor sand courts are the only saving grace. they have a terrible beer selection and the majority of their patrons are complete douchebags (read: fat, shirtless guys and snooki wannabes). the parking lot is ALWAYS full, and people seem to think it's cool to park other people in rather than park on the street (and the bar seems ok with this). if you aren't coming to play sand volleyball, don't bother, seriously."}
{"text":"Bad business, bad service.  The only thing keeping this place in business is their awesome volleyball set up.  Place is trashy... so is the guy whose family owns the place.  If he isn't trashed and offending customers, and employees, then he probably isn't working."}
{"text":"Not a bad place....

I've only been here once for lunch with my co-workers in a large group. The service was quick for how many people were in our party. The food was very average. My black bean wrap was fine and the curly fries were good!

It's definitely a place you go for typical bar food. A little greasy, but if that's what you want, then it works!"}
{"text":"Ate there one time.  If you ask me 20 years from now how many times I've eaten there I guarantee the answer will still be one.  Biggest waste of $28 I've ever spent.  McDonald's next door, with their green slime meat and screaming kids would be ten times better for lunch than this place."}
{"text":"Went here for my girls 40th bday.. it was us 4 plus 3 other ppl the entire Friday night. Plus side to it being VERY dead is the Dj played almost all the songs we requested and we were able to dance the night away peacefully !! The bartender was great and hooked us up with lots and lots of olives, we had a great time."}
{"text":"Have not had a bad meal there after dozens of visits. Servers have always been very attentive and friendly. Very fair prices"}
