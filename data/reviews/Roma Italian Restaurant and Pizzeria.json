{"text":"Best place for  pizza anda beer in the north! nice lounge, family friendly, italian food. prices are very good!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Has a traditional Italian pizza shop taste. Also really good Italian and steak hoagies. One of the best in the area. Would always recommend. If you are in the mood for a salad try the Romano crusted chicken salad and you won't want to have another salad ever again."}
{"text":"Great, family owned pizza shop/restaurant!!! Scratch made food, and some of the best pizza around!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza we've found in the North Hills so far. Excellent cheese and sauce, good crust, a little stingy on the pepperoni though."}
{"text":"The absolute worst delivery service I have ever experienced.  Time and time again they forget items and are terribly rude on the phone.  Have tried to be understanding but will never order from here again. Also the bar atmosphere is extremely uncomfortable and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"My first time there I was confused on what door to enter.  We went in one door and there were a number of tables there but no waitress or other people in the room.  Lingered for a while and walked into the bar and sat down.  Bartender came over to our booth with menu's and we asked her if there was a restaurant there?  She said sure right next door.  We were pointed to a small hallway door and upon entering we were in the restaurant.  Definitely confusing when it is your first time there!!  We were seated and we ordered our food.  Great service and plenty of food.  Food was so good we went back the following week and entered into the right door.  Food was good again, prices are reasonable.  Only gave four stars because the entrance is very confusing."}
{"text":"The FOOD is wonderful. The woman who works the take-out/catering counter? Unbelievable. Watched her cuss out a customer in front of me, then tried to get into it with me.
I had my proof of purchase, I just wanted to pick up the food for my brother's engagement party. I was in there ten minutes longer than necessary because she kept attempting to start an argument about \"WPXI coupons\".
I'll skip the drama and get my next party catered somewhere where I'm treated with kindness and respect."}
{"text":"My family and I visit Roma regularly. Always have excellent service, and wonderful food."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Roma in a few years....... my loss, everything was great. I had the Ziti with peppers, onion and Hot Sausage and my lovely wife had the small cheese pizza and everything was delicious!  We will be sure to come again in the near future."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time at Roma and we're glad we came! Zero wait to be seated at 7pm on a Saturday. We first thought it was just a bar and then we noticed the other entrance to the restaurant. Little confusing entrance. It was just remodeled and it's nice inside. The food was good and we had so much leftover. Hubby got the veal parm and it came w a salad, bread knots, and fries. Service very friendly too. Our kids loved it and want to come back!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the prices reasonable . The service and decor were comfortable . This is a nice local place to go for a good filling Italian meal . They have a large and comfortable bar lounge and even a small outdoor seating area . Try it ..you'll like it !"}
{"text":"Don't order delivery. Over an hour after a 40 minute quote, and I live less than 4 miles from the restaurant. Previous  pizzas have been burnt."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to meet for lunch but we had limited time available and we were not quite sure where to go so we ventured onto Perry Highway and decided to try out Roma because we saw they had outdoor seating .  After looking at the menu we were told they also offer a lunch buffet inside the dining area so we opted to have the buffet  This was a perfect choice because we were able to try out various menu selections and it saved us the right amount of time to eat . We were told that the entr√©e choices change day to day.  The restaurant has a huge dining room and a very large bar with an open patio.  It looks like the perfect spot to be on game night."}
{"text":"I have stopped by here twice for lunch with my father in the past couple of months with the most recent time a few Tuesdays ago.  The inside of the restaurant here is pretty dim, especially as soon as you walk in but it gets brighter the closer you get towards the windows which surround about half of the seating areas.  There seems to be two distinct seating areas in here with both having a number of tables and booths.  During the lunch hours there is also a buffet set in the foyer type area.
 
Both times that I have gone with my father we have ordered the buffet and each time the items on it were different.  However the general setup was similar with there being one entree, one starch, one vegetable, one soup, some salad and different pizzas coming out.  The soup was wedding soup both times but the entree this last time was stuffed peppers while the previous time it was chicken parmesan, the vegetable this last time was green beans while the previous time it was greens and beans and the starch this time was some scalloped potatoes and I dont remember what it was the previous time.  While none of these items blew me away, they were all pretty solid and I enjoyed trying each of them.  My favorite part of the buffet has to be the pizza though.  While the restaurant itself was slow getting out new pizzas (they do two at a time with multiple toppings on each), the pizza itself is easily some of the better pizza in the North Hills.  Yes it is greasy but it also has the perfect ratio of cheese/sauce and crust for me with the outer crust have a nice crisp to it.
 
The bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future.  While the food itself may only be 4 star worthy, I really enjoy this buffet and the value of the place easily makes it worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hadn't gone there in a long time, too hot to cook so decided on pizza.  Called in our order, nothing hard, medium cheese pizza, 4 slice Sicilian and there Roma puffs.  Had to wait for my order even though I got there when they said it would be ready, the take out pick up area reeks of cigarette smoke. I could hardly breathe.  Everything was hot when I brought it home.  The pizza was ok, nothing special, the Sicilian was over cooked, burnt on the edges and the biggest disappointment was the puffs.  Someone forget to put the cheese on them so it was just fried dough with watery sauce.  Very disappointed.  It must have been a slow night because 3 waitresses were sitting outside having a loud conversation and cursing for the customers."}
{"text":"Updated review! We love the wings here! The recent renovations are beautiful! Changed from a 4 to a 5 because the sound inside is so much better! Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"****Bar review only****
My husband and I were in town for Thanksgiving and met a friend of mine and her boyfriend here (their choice) for after dinner drinks. It was not crowded at all around 8:30pm on the day after Turkey Day. The special was $3 captains but all of us went for beer instead. I like the craft variety as opposed to the usual suspects at places like this-Miller lite, bud light, coors light, Yuengling-and there were a couple of options. The first bartender was pretty terrible and couldn't list the IPAs they had (after telling me they had 2), went over to check them and reported back to me, and then came back and said she read them wrong and wanted to make sure I still wanted one of them but still could only tell me the brewery they were from and not the full name. Odd. The later bartender at least kept the glass full when I wanted another one. So Friday night is karaoke and it was......well, hopefully no one that did it actually thinks they have a future on The Voice. The song choices were pretty terrible too ranging from country to Christmas songs. I would not have chosen to come here on my own but I am glad my friend chose here because it's a non-smoking bar (Yep, in PA they still have bars you can smoke in) so there's that. Maybe their food is better......"}
{"text":"About 33% more expensive than the Pizza Roma in Cranberry.  On the positive side it's more clean.  Closer to Luciano's pricing in Mars with a lower quality food."}
{"text":"Had Gene Marie in catering cater a party for my family a couple of weeks ago and went to pick it up day of and she insisted we canceled the order...nothing was ready they had to make everything from scratch and the food was HOURS late. She kept blaming it on my family and being super rude, after we had text messages to confirm that she said food would be ready for the date and time we had scheduled. It was absolutely horrible she was so rude and will NOT be planning any more catering orders through her from that party on. DO NOT RECOMMEND. If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"When they don't have enough menus for the table (4 people) it should've been a sign the experience wouldn't be good. Service wasn't to great and it took almost 40 minutes for our food. Pizza was average with nothing to pull me back. If you have a choice between Roma and another place go to the other place."}
{"text":"Great daily buffet.  I had Roma's cater my husband's retirement party
 and everyone raved about the food, I was so happy.  Great people and great food."}
{"text":"Prices aren't bad. Place is nice. Ordered the roma puffs. They were ok but on the dry side. Also ordered the Roma pizza with everything except hot peppers and anchovies. This pizza was very good. I would definitely come back here for the pizza."}
{"text":"This place is going to be a new regular for me and my family!  I had to take my wife to Autozone, which is right across the street.  We didn't know where to go for dinner, so we went here.  Food is AMAZING!!!  And we had the best server (Justin).    My wife and I have a very picky son.  They were able to accommodate him!  Best Italian restaurant in the area!  SO going back here!!!  Can't WAIT to try the Pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Roma 2 1/2 stars  we went for the Halloween party because the best DJ's ever we're there Rick and Jeff they are flawless. We won the couples costume contest and got a gift card so we went back for Thanksgiving Eve karaoke. Both times we went the bartender was rude. We thought for Halloween party maybe she was just having an off night but for Thanksgiving Eve she was down right awful. She alone makes us not want to go back. She refused to give us a food menu until our entire table got up and gave her id's, we get it you are doing your job, but if you need to be 21 to be in the restaurant get a bouncer. (We are all 22-26 years old) we ordered a pizza, while the majority of the pizza was quite good two of the slices were inedible because they were bubbled hollow no toppings bread. The atmosphere was unwelcoming due to the bartenders sooty-ness."}
{"text":"This is MY go to when I want pizza. Hands down my favorite. Dinners, sandwiches, salads are also very good. Staff is always friendly. Great neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I. Had their version of Stromboli. Definitely not impressed. Nothing like the Stromboli I am used to. It didn't even have any salami or pepperoni in it. Just ham, lettuce, tomato, and mozzarella."}
