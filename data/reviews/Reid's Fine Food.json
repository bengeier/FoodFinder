{"text":"Love stopping by this cute little place on my lunch for a bite. The roast beef sandwich on a french roll is really good; tender roast beef with horseradish on a fluffy french roll. They also sell a bunch of other specialty items and have a deli and butcher counter."}
{"text":"Great food and incredible personal service. Steve and the crew made my first visit memorable and pleasant. I'll definitely tell everyone about Reid's and were loyal customers now."}
{"text":"The quality of the food seems nice, don't get me wrong, but if you are looking for a place to go to more than one time ever this is probably not the place.  Everything is extremely expensive and is not far superior than cheaper options.  Sand-which counter chick was bored and on her phone.  I would't want to order anything from her.  The meats looked good again but not for what they are asking.  Cool place, novelty place, a place you go when you are rich in Waxhaw and don't want to spend anything less than too much.  The seafood was very VERY, VERY poor quality and condition.  They need to stop selling it."}
{"text":"Great specialty store with high quality meat and a good selection of wine. I also eat lunch here several times per week. The salads and sandwiches are freshly made to order and are delicious as well as priced well. They have a selection of chocolate and candy covered nuts which are to die for. I highly recommend this establishment."}
