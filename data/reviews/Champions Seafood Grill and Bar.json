{"text":"Champion Seafood BBQ is a decent place if you are in the mood for some Asian style seafood. We decided to try it out on a week night. They were quiet empty.   We ordered the grilled mussel, lobster, beef & lamb skewer, and the grilled salmon and fries. Everything came fairly quickly. The grilled mussels had a lot of garlic on them, and if you know garlic, you'd know how strong they can be. The beef and lamb skewers were okay.. my problem with them is that they weren't hot.. and considering this is a BBQ place, id expect my skewers to be piping hot. The grilled salmon and fries were good, salmon had good flavour. My favourite dish has to be the grilled lobster. It was fresh! But points off for trying so hard to mislead customers into thinking the lobster was grilled when they clearly steamed it.   This place is very similar to captains boil in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonably priced. Oysters were fresh and tasty. Specially the grilled oysters and grilled scallops were amazing... Friendly staff. I would definitely come back here again. Omg i love this place"}
{"text":"Had the two-persons combo($59.99). A bit on the expensive side, but you do get a dozen oysters (or 4 grilled ones), lobster, scallops (2 pcs), udon soup, and skews (and veggy of choice). The portions are reasonable (read: very filling). Overall I would recommend coming here to try for sure. I'll be back for more!  Good service!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday dinner was pretty slow. Lots of different variety but was massed in their seasoning pretty much felt like your eating the same thing. Grill oyster was not fresh, not sure if the restaurant used pre shucked oysters and just place them in the shell to cook, same as the scallop. Some shells are darker than others, hopefully not. On the pricey side"}
{"text":"We ordered the inoki mushrooms, egg plant (skin was a bit hard but flavour was good) scallops, conch.  For skewers we ordered the beef and lamb skewers. Everything tasted pretty good and nice with my Sapporo.  The service was excellent, very friendly and attentive. Will definitely come back again to try other items."}
{"text":"All I can say is... $12.99 for a dozen oysters! Everything was very fresh. They had great combos for very good prices. Great place for seafood."}
{"text":"No, no, no. For a seafood restaurant that deals in grill and hot pot, both were completely misses. Not only are we talking about 5.99 per meat add in for hot pot, you're also getting about 4 extremely thin slices of meat (yes, at the price of 5.99) in a soup base that's saltier than overwatch comp players. I'm sorry, but I've had my share of Chinese hot pot and grill and this place was definitely not one of the good ones; if anything it's one of the WORST.   I came here with my dad after work and the reason I wanted to come here was to get the conch my dad loves so much, but to our dismay, it was sold out and not in season. Apparently it's not worth it if you don't order their hot pot sets, but honestly from what I saw at other tables it wasn't any more worth than ordering separate add ins. Their add ins are so expensive, $5.99 for 4 small pieces of meat?! No thank you. I can get a whole box at Foody. 1.99 for a few strands of veggies?!?! Again, TNT's right next door. If I knew it was going to be this expensive for supermarket quality food I would've just gone grocery shopping and made my own hot pot.   We also ordered the cumin BBQ fish, which was LOADED with cumin powder (the taste was overwhelming, so disgusting!!) and more green onions as a topping than our entire meal combined. I can't believe they even had the audacity to serve this to us. This was not food, this was gross at best.   No, I will never eat here again. One star for the service because even though they recommended all the wrong foods, they were at least somewhat visible when we tried to flag them down for things, and of course 0/5 for the food."}
