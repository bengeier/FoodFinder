{"text":"5hisbus my favourite place to stop for something to eat when I'm traveling back from somewhere...too far to go home and I'm starving (since airplane food just doesn't cut it) - the gyoza us delicious and I love the Sushi - ya bento!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at this restaurant during my first visit to Toronto. I had the lobster soup and bulgogi. Both were very tasty. I really enjoyed the atmosphere in the restaurant as well. I'm only had bulgogi once before but it had more marinate that it was served with last time. Not sure which time was correct but either way, it was yummy."}
{"text":"Honestly blown away by the quality of sushi here. I ordered the kiku combo(?) and the miso was good, the salad was refreshing, and then the sushi was amazing. I paired with a asahi beer which was great as always. 

I recommend giving this place a chance. Within 5-10min from Pearson airport"}
{"text":"Sushi restaurants are hard to find.

Sashimi was fresh, service friendly, atmosphere nice."}
{"text":"solid sushi place with really fresh fish"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for a special occasion and were very disappointed and will never go back. The food was ok, nothing special, but the problem was with the sushi cooks at the back of the restaurant. They had a few friends sitting at their prep table who were loud and drunk. Every few minutes either the cook would pour saki in all their glasses and yell out extremely loud salute and they would all drink up, or one of the other 3 drunks would do it and they would all drink, laugh loudly and act as drunken fools do. I never saw a more drunken bunch including the cooks. After paying $20 a meal to enjoy a meal out, last thing I wanted was a bunch of loud drunken cooks and their friends ruining our special occasion. This behaviour would be more suited for a rowdy bar. With so many other options in this area, I would never go back and would not recommend anyone to go there."}
{"text":"Stayed near Toronto airport and picked this restaurant based on other Yelpers' reviews.  I work for a Japanese company, so I like to take to opportunity to get good Japanese food in the US and Canada and Sushi-Ya did the job.

The meal was very good. Large pieces of flavorful sushi. Also enjoyed a wide variety of Japanese dishes including gyoza, soba and miso in addition to the sushi.

It is a great little spot to visit if you are staying near the airport and want to get out for a meal. Good service, good atmosphere and an overall good choice."}
{"text":"service was friendly and efficient.  birds nest soup amuse Bouche was nice touch.  sushi was technically correct and as fresh as can be expected this far from the ocean.  spicy mayo a bit too salty.  Tempura was delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome little place, the food is really tasty with interesting dishes, very Japanese decor which I really like, somewhat dark so great for romantic date"}
{"text":"I'm a regular however after last night's dinner, I don't think I will be returning. The food is great but the service was beyond horrendous. 

Ordered Beef Sashimi to start, waitress brings out beef tartare and proceeds to tell me that is what I ordered. I show her the menu again and point out what I ordered and what she brought. She goes on about an old menu like it's my fault she doesn't know the fucking new menu. She's also full of shit considering that item is ordered regularly without any issues. Ordered white wine, got red, also got questioned about if I actually ordered white.

Mind you, I physically point out things in the menu that I'm ordering to avoid confusion."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside but this is a total hidden gem! Very classic decor ...not your usual loud brash eye assaulting type you see normally. Add to that excellent service, greetings for every person who enters from the sushi chefs and some of the best sushi I've ever had...I always stop here when I'm coming back from a trip...its always the highlight at the end of my travels."}
{"text":"Looking for a relax restaurant around the airport area other than hotels or chains. Saw this listing on Yelp. Was pleasantly surprised by this little restaurant very close to the highway. Staff was decent. Service was great and offered warm towel service, very rare in today's Japanese restaurant. I ordered bulgogi and it's tender and came with brown rice. Would definitely recommend to go back. Ample of parking at the rear as well!"}
{"text":"I would rank this place as the best mid-level sushi place in Etobicoke. There isn't a lot of good places in Etobicoke but this is a consistently strong one.  Fresh and good quality... can get a bit busy for dinner rushes, especially Friday night.

Prices are slightly higher than most mid-level sushi places but quality difference is noticeable.

Food - They are pretty busy so the sashimi/sushi cycles through fairly quickly.  Good variety of sushi, sashimi and maki items and sometimes they bring in some less common items like Bluefin Toro or real Japanese Snapper.   Sashimi cuts are down well and cuts are above average quality.  Teriyaki dishes are all flavourful but a bit on the smaller portion size.

Service - The are friendly and add the extra touches like the hot towels.  If it is busy you may end up waiting longer than you are used to for your order... more based on the speed of the sushi chefs vs the servers.

Environment - Small and intimate with a slightly upscale feel to it... mostly tables only and a couple booths.  Good for dates, groups or families.

For mid-level sushi this is my go to in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my son and really enjoyed the sushi. The service and presentation were excellent. The sushi had amazing flavour which we both enjoyed."}
{"text":"This place has never let me down. I've been coming for years and they always serve fresh and delicious foods. 
I tried Galbi which is a BBQ short ribs and it was so~ooo good!  It really went well with Asahi beer. I also had some rolls and Crazy Roll was a real BOMB. It was so yummy. Can't wait for the next visit!!"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy atmosphere! Got lunch bento tempura box.  Portion little bit smaller but decent food and good green tea on the house!!! Great service with smile."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed at a hotel down the road from this place and we decided to try out a sushi place near by. Quickly discovered the warm friendly staff and the delicious food. We have gone back a couple times and got to know the staff. \"Speedy\" is entertaining and excellent at his job. We sit at the bar and watch them make the food and it's a lot of fun. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"3 stars for a decent meal. Service was good nothing to complain about, nothing to brag about. It is a typical sushi restaurant nothing special, the usual stuff. The only difference is that this place is way overpriced and  definitely not worth the price tag. A large order of assorted veggie & shrimp tempura was $17 and it wasnt THAT large. Im afraid to see what the small looked like. When it comes to japanese cuisine, im always willing to splurge. After eating here I walked out feeling rippes off. As far as value goes -1. 

-Beef Sashimi $11- dry, over cooked, disappointing
-Sushi ya roll and Soft shell crab roll werent bad, enjoyable but the rice was too mushy and wet. 

Im not going to bore you with anymore food descriptions.

Not to be a snoot but I do believe it is rated too high. Probably a place where california roll eaters would love. ;)"}
{"text":"Visiting the area on business. One of the better Japanese restaurants I've been to. Had miso soup, spicy salmon roll, and the veggie yaki udon. Every bit of it was wonderful. The salmon roll was the perfect temperature. The service was great too! My friend and I were given complimentary noodles which were yummy."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I spent a few weeks in the vicinity of the airport on business, and most of the restaurants around are a wasteland of mediocre to bad chains. Sushi-Ya was the lone exception--friendly and good-natured service, good food, fun atmosphere. It became my go-to quickly."}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty mediocre. Service was not good. Our waitress full on sat down at another customers table and had a 20 minute conversation with them ignoring us."}
{"text":"I found a hotel near the airport so I could get out easily on an early flight the next morning. Let me say the Holiday Inn had seen better days. But, I had the good fortune to find Sushi-Ya Japan across the street for a fabulous dinner. Not sure if the staff was all family, but they acted like it and clearly took pride in their restaurant. Great service, authentic and talented sushi chefs, homey environment, and a delcious meal. So glad I found it. All thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this restaurant for the first time this afternoon. We both lived in Japan for 4 years and consider this a really great experience! The food was lovely, decor is traditional and the service was as attentive and authentic as we would expect in Japan! So refreshing! Also being the Christmas season we were offered two gifts at the end of our meal. Two hand towels with Christmas designs embroidered on them and wrapped with a bow. Being our first visit we were both impressed and very grateful! We live an hour away from this restaurant so sadly we can't make it a regular stop but when we are back in this area we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner was a happy accident because I started out for another restaurant but my GPS decided to not give me turn-by-turn directions and I ended up here. I had yakatori (beef) and a caterpillar roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, spicy mayo, tobiko). The skewers delicious, although I wish there was a bit more meat on them. The rolls were divine, but \"spicy\" is a gross exaggeration of the mayo. The sushi chefs seemed a bit more attentive than the waitresses but all in all, I had a good experience and a great meal."}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance. Presentation was very nice and overall feel of the place is very cool. Great for a date night. I was not however thrilled with the food choices I made. The green salad had some sweet Thai style dressing that although was good I woukd have preferred the traditional miso dressing. The fried calamari were a total dissapointment, oily, lacking in flavor and chewy...the dipping sauce was mild and bland...the Thai style salad dressing woukd have been better suited. The calamari rings were huge...not cool. The batter came once you bit into the chewy calamari and it pulled right out. Spicy tuna roll...way to Spicy for my taste and had cucumber added...not cool. The shrimp tempura caterpillar roll would have been nice if it were not for the large unecessary amount of mayo. Service I must say was excellent and the experience was good, but the food needs tweaking. Still recommend as the flavors may be more suitable for the locals."}
{"text":"One of the servers was grumpy because I got here 45 mins before closing.  If you don't want to serve us, then tell us you are closed. Food was not good at all. Been here many time before and food was usually very good but this time, it was not good at all. The miso soup had a detergent taste and the tempura crumbs around the dynamite roll was stale.   Would not come back. Poor service combined with bad food."}
{"text":"I got a special shasimi boat today. It is so fresh and incredible decoration. I love this place. And i want to coming here again."}
{"text":"Such a good sushi place. The lunch specials are worth it. Good quality and awesome service. Definitely my new sushi place in the neighbourhood. I really enjoyed this."}
{"text":"This place looks like a little hole in the wall until you walk through the door.  Different place totally.  Service was great, sushi chefs saying hello.  Has the Alaska roll and assorted sushi.  Fish has a bigger cut than usual which was slim and nicely done.  Had scallop which was real,fresh and probably top 5.  

Oh yea and they started with an app,on the house which is always cool"}
{"text":"I visited here with my wife for lunch.  We both love how nice it was inside.   Very clean and freindly service.  I thought the food was wonderful and It brought back memories for me of okinawa japan.  The bento lunch was decently priced and very good.  

Its a great place to try if you have time to sit down and relax to some authentic japanese food."}
{"text":"I have visited this place only once in 2012. 

Me and my husband tried the sushi last year because we had to eat before we go to Pearson Airport. 
And I don't usually eat sushi at Japanese restaurant because I am Japanese and I make sushi at home when I needed.

Let me just say....we felt sick after we had a sushi boat in this place. 

Service: Not bad at all however, we waited more than 20mins.
Atmosphere: Great! I liked the Decor.
Food: Appetizer was good but sushi boat....especially, white fish was really fishy. 
All the sashimi didn't cook properly to me. I mean the sashimi is raw however, something was not right. 

If I need to eat sushi at Etobicoke then I would choose somewhere else.
Sorry..."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and good. A bit on the salty side. If you are ever in the neighbourhood, give this place a try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here last night with a group of friends including two small children.  I must say that it was definitely worth the drive from Scarborough as the staff were very accommodating.  My phone call to make reservations alone was very pleasant.  The representative who made my reservation even asked if it was a special occasion and was incredibly kind enough to give a birthday amenity to the celebrant.  They even dimmed the lights and sang happy birthday to the little guy so he felt incredibly special!

On top of the amazing and warm atmosphere, the food was very good and again they were accommodating.  If you have any special dietary restrictions especially with rice/starch/carbs, they can substitute white rice with wild rice which was very good.  

Their sashimi was nice and fresh. Tempura was also very good as well as their teriyaki chicken.  I just personally wish they would add a little more mixed vegetables with the chicken.  

What was also very nice was that they gave us some complimentary spring rolls which were also really good.  

The wait staff were very warm and friendly while the chefs and cooks were very very entertaining! I would honestly take the trek again just for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Really good sushi over the road from my nondescript hotel in a nondescript part of town. Would not have looked at this place twice but very glad I did. 

I had a soft shell crab roll, which held together well, had a great crunch and was just spicy enough, super fresh tuna sashimi and a seared beef sashimi that it's possible I will go to sleep thinking about. 

Location looks a little tatty on the outside but is comfortable and intimate on the inside. Was less than half full and several diners were - like me - solo business travelers but the place still had a hum to it."}
{"text":"Went there with friends, a group of 9 people. We were in the area for a business meeting. Decided to go out for dinner. So I looked up sushi places near to where we stay & found this. 
Place and seating is good, quiet, homey. 
Menu has variety of options.
We ordered shared plates. Mix of sashimi and sushi. (Live boat, medium
Sashimi boat, sushi-ya combo, she me others as well... ) 
Very delicious & tasty. Sashimi tasted fresh and very nice. Melts in the mouth. You just keep eating one after another. Sushi was perfectly made.

The group liked the place & the service vey much. We enjoyed the food and kept ordering 3 turns. 

I recommend this place to anyone staying in the area. One of  he good sushi places."}
{"text":"The food here is very good compared to other sushi places in the area with decent prices. It doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside is quaint and cozy. There are good options for those that are not sushi fans. I found everything to be well presented and fresh. However, I found the service to be slow, inattentive, and uninterested.  Not once was I asked if everything tasted alright. I was only asked if I had finished. There were only three tables occupied while I was present so there can be no excuse for their lack of attention. It pained me to leave a tip for the server however the kitchen deserved it."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Holiday Inn and looked at the local Yelp reviews.  It had good ratings so I walked over.  It was packed with regulars and I was fortunate to get a table.  The service was superb and the food was excellent.  I had the sushi appetizer and the salmon teriyaki - which was delicious.  The atmosphere was also excellent.

They could do a better job on their entrance...but there is no doubt I'll be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Sushi-Ya is some of the best sushi in this part of town. The place is tiny and the prices might be a little steeper than some of the other places around town but in my opinion its entirely worth it. The service was quick and friendly. The food is beautifully presented.  I will be going back again"}
{"text":"Even though this restaurant was somewhat on the expensive side, but the food here was really worth it. I got the chirashi bowl, and the fish was FRESH!! I highly recommend this restaurant especially if you are just visiting the area looking for some decent asian meal."}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation by my hotel concierge during a business trip to Toronto.  As for location, it was great considering I was staying near the airport.  I also liked that they have a free small parking lot for the restaurant.   The sushi was mediocre, however.  

The sushi tasted not bad, but not great, either.  The spicy tuna was not spicy at all.  In fact, it was actually kind of sweet.  It's not what one would expect when ordering SPICY tuna.  I like to order spicy tuna when judging a sushi joint because it's such a staple - and then I figure if they can't do that right, don't bother with the rest.  (Kinda like ordering pad thai at Thai restaurants).  But I had ordered spicy tuna and eel rolls together for my dinner.  Unfortunately, the eel wasn't so great either.  Eel *is* typically sweet because of the sauce, so that wasn't so weird, but it was cold.  I'm used to eating eel warm. 

Luckily, I had also ordered noodles as an appetizer with my sushi.  
The chop chae noodles are some of the best I've had - I love that Sushi-Ya's wasn't too greasy, and it was extremely flavorful.  Before Sushi-Ya, my favorite place for Chop Chae was a Korean BBQ joint in Los Angeles called HK barbecue in Little Tokyo.  I have to say, Sushi-Ya's was better.   I was also served a tasting of some soba noodles with fish broth - both the noodles and the broth were very tasty and not too heavy.  

Overall, the noodles here are great, but the sushi is just okay."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is not to be missed.  The establishment is very low key looking from the outside but the food is amazing.  I stop by every time I'm in this area at lunch time.  The chefs are true artists and the staff are very helpful.  The place can serve excellent food both during the lunch hour rush or for a long slow dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Honestly was expecting better given its rating. Food was okay but the prices were aggressive. Wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Good sushi and ok atmosphere. It looks a little dated, especially compared to Makimono across the street. The sushi and sashimi selections were mostly well prepared and tasty, although the salmon looked like they were trying to get one more cut out of a bad fillet. The rolls were quite large. No complaints other than the misshapen salmon. Pretty decent overall."}
{"text":"Not much to look at from the outside but when u step inside u are transformed in an atmosphere of quaint Japanese setting. Servers inside are friendly and hospital and man was it packed!!! Cars took all the spots outside and diners were happily eating their sashimi n sushi inside.

I hAd the unagi don. I liked the salad because it was fresh and crisp. The soup tasted like all miso soup, nothing special. The unagi don with organic rice was of tiny portion for 16 dollars. But the purple rice was interesting to taste n the unagi tasted fresh. I was still a little hungry after tho, if only the portion was a little bigger I would give it a five star. When I go to eat sushi at new generation and sushi time, the portion is much much bigger and I never finish it. But I finish this portion really quickly. 

Loved how the chefs says good bye to u after u finish eating. 

All in all, a great first experience."}
{"text":"You may drive right by this restaurant and never think to go in, it's store front is very nondescript and the parking lot is quite small and near a busy street.  I recommend you overlook all of that and grab some food from here.

My boss and coworker took me here for my birthday lunch (at my request). The waitress brought us over some sort of chicken \"bites\" compliments of the house which were very tasty as we waited for our meals. They both had the sushi & sashimi combo ($15) which was very fresh and came with purple rice, miso soup and salad.  I had the Bulgogi, Tempura and Sushi Bento box ($15).  The portions were very generous and everything was really very good.  I loved the Bulgogi especially, I had it \"spicy\" which suited me perfectly.  

The interior of this restaurant looks like an old Irish pub with white washed walls and dark beamed ceilings, however the dim lighting and added decor touches made it a bit more authentic feeling, nice comfortable environment.  It was a bit warm for my liking though (the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars) It was also quite busy for a Tuesday at lunchtime, pretty much full.  I did feel the waitresses rushed us a bit, never asked if we wanted any dessert, just brought the bill when she saw were were done. 

I do recommend Sushi-Ya Japan, it's great food at a great price."}
{"text":"I stumbled over Sushi-Ya of course on Yelp. The reviews were great which lead me to a try.
Located on a main connector in a standalone building it was easy to miss. The interior itself was a very positive surprise and the Japanese style was greatly designed and very welcoming.
I ordered an Alaska specialty role, as well as the hamachi neki along with seaweed salad and seafood soup. 
The sushi was fresh, the seafood soup well balanced and \"rich\" in seafood (not just 1-2 pieces of fish as served in other restaurants). The foods served were all well prepared and the quality of the ingredients used great. If you haven't already, I can only recommend sushi-ya!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this kind of standard is not acceptable anywhere. How can this place receive more than 2 stars. Ordered 10pcs sushi + 10pcs sashimi combo. This is what came. 3pcs red snapper sushi, 3pcs salmon sushi, 3pcs tuna sushi....1 eel sushi....Now to the sashimi...4pcs of tuna ??? 3pcs of salmon??? 3 pcs of red snapper ??? At least have some variety? Eating 7 pcs of tuna is pure sick (fyi they dont make the sushi on sushi rice)...Ordered grilled steak medium rare and it taste like something out of panda express. I don't know the reason of asking me how I would like my steak done if it came out hard as rocks. Avoid and run away! You been warned."}
{"text":"Sushi-ya is one of the best places in this part of the city to get sushi. The service is quick and friendly and the sushi is very good. The prices are a little steeper than some of he locations downtown but it's still reasonable.

This is my go to place when I have a craving for a sushi lunch at work.

Note that if you're driving here, the lot is TINY! It's usually full when I come so I park in the plaza across the street."}
{"text":"Not certain what the sashimi and sushi are like but their Tempura was very disappointing. The shrimp were stuck together, the tempura had not been properly battered and very oily."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times now... And they have pretty consistent service. The food quality is very different when it's busy versus not being as busy. The taste is very generic... I really like their miso and California rolls, but the rest is very normal tasting and nothing special. Parking here is also a pain in the butt."}
{"text":"Great food. Great recommendations from gents behind the sushi bar. Like sitting at the bar because the gents are more tuned in to you, your preferences, and have more invested in your satisfaction since you're eating right in front of them, and all of that was true and perfect here.  He even served the sashimi on the side of a freshly filleted snapper fish as the serving bed. Never seen that before and it was impressive and beautiful.  And delicious. Would go back!"}
{"text":"I was forced to come- 
I'm trying to find the right words here. It's not the kind of place where I would order raw food. 

I definitely would not come back here again, but if you're hungry- it's better than being hungry. 

The restaurant was busy the whole time we were there, so it's clearly popular. Only two waitresses and they were clearly overworked. 

3 stars for being exactly what I expected and hard working waitresses."}
{"text":"How did I miss this place? I travel out of YYZ fairly often and saw this place and never tried it. I was looking for a dinner spot late-ish on a Sunday night and my other go to spot disappeared into a construction site. So my friends and I gave this a try. We got the sushi ya bento box which includes just about everything you would want--sushi, sashimi, tempura, grilled chicken and some vegetables! And it was good too. They were very accommodating to our late arrival. New favorite in the area of the Dixon airport hotel strip."}
{"text":"Sushi ya is great. A real gem. I've been there twice, and will definitely be making my way there again!"}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews and I generally refrain from doing so, but I feel I need to because I got fooled by the great reviews I read on Yelp before going there. This place is seriously overrated in our opinion.

Although the fish was fresh, all sushi rolls tasted the same (and pretty bland). They put spicy mayo on literally every single roll we ordered although they were all, according to their description, very different rolls. Our waitress also didn't really have a clue about what she was selling. She told us a particular roll had unagi on it, but instead, it was steak. Overall, the rolls lacked inspiration and taste.

The restaurant is nice inside, definitely nicer than the outside. We found it way too loud, however.

We were hoping to find a hidden gem. Unfortunately, we left very disappointed."}
{"text":"We randomly selected this place since it was right next to our hotel. I thought this was a good choice for where we stayed at since there was not much around. And it's convenient for those who just have arrived to Toronto Airport. 

It was a late night meal so we came sometimes after 8P.M and there was no wait. I imagine it can get crowded too due to a small place. But even though it wasn't crowded, their service was not as attentive as I thought. 

|Chirashi Bowl| 18CAD
That's about $14 US money depend on the rate at the time. That's not expensive at all considering it was for dinner. The wait was a bit long even when the restaurant was kinda empty. I enjoyed the quality of fish & the portion was good. You get approx 12 pieces of different fish. The meal also come with a soup & salad.  

|Tofu Teriyaki| 14CAD
There are a lot of vegetarian options and this was one of the decent one if you crave for teriyaki plate! The plate come with six pieces of teriyaki tofu, rice, salad, & miso soup. The tofu was nice, firm and saucy. I don't see much of this at other Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Horrible service. OK food with the price tag. I've had much better sushi at the same if not lower price. 

Came here because it had a high yelp review. What a huge disappointment.

We walked in and the hostess/waitress did not say a word. Looked at us like we disturbed her on her break. Led us to the table, didn't say a word and left.

The place was dark it was difficult to read the menu. 

Ordered spicy salmon and rainbow rolls. The spicy salmon is spicy, but not in the right way (Wow Sushi in downtown Toronto does the spicy the right way). And what is up with their soy sauce? It's way too salty for sushi! Good thing we only ordered two rolls to do taste testing. 

I would not return."}
{"text":"Sushi and miso soup were ok, but they use sweet teriyaki sauce on lots of dishes. I was shocked that the soba dressing tasted like teriyaki. I don't recommend dishes other than sushi here."}
{"text":"The Toro here is unique and much better than most Toronto restaurants"}
{"text":"Food: Worst black dragon roll I've ever had. It got minimum ingredients, yes, it had everything that their menu said, but amount was tiny. 

Service: I went there during Anime North 2017, so I understand that they were crazy busy, but even I consider the point, it was below the average. The wast part was that they automatically collect 18% of service fee even we are only 4 people. 

Conclusion: I was happy about be able to sit down and eat my friend during the super busy day, but I won't go back there because a half day old take-out sushi will be much much better."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service.  Good price. Sushi chefs are fun.  A little miffed that they don't have soy or rice paper."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant I've ever been to. Their food and service is consistently amazing, whether I've ordered take-out or dined in. The atmosphere itself is very cute and great for date nights. When you order take-out, they package your food very carefully which is something I always appreciate. This is my go-to spot for non-AYCE sushi. They're worth the extra money, drive, wait - whatever it may be so definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant near the airport. Intimate and clean. Staff are attentive and fast. Food might be a little pricey compared to ayce places but it's worth it. Maki set is delicious as is the beef teriyaki. 

Portions are a decent size. 

Real Wasabi too! 

All in all decent dining."}
{"text":"This is the way restaurants should be!! Fantastic decoration, delicious food and great atmosphere! It's got to be the best sushi place I've been! The chefs are a hoot, the staff is kind and polite! The decorations and cuisine are all authentic! Defiantly worth a visit and worth a return trip!

Here's a video of \"speedy\" serving up some beer, with Saki shots and a blow torch! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF5Y_WQPaAY"}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing!!  I had the Alaska Roll and I couldn't be more pleased.  The service was spot on and the price was very reasonable.  I'll definitely be coming back on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Was alone on business and stopped in. Food was great and service was as well. I'll come back next time I'm in Toronto. I had the sushi deluxe combo and felt the portions and price were on point."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner during anime north and had a mostly simple and pleasant meal. Despite the large crowds at the convention, the wait wasn't too bad and we only had to wait 15 minutes for a pair. The only kicker was that you had to share a table, I'm not that picky so we just went ahead and did it. And I'm only assuming this only happens when it's like super busy.

I'm reviewing this place based on one dish and that's my go to: the hoe deop bap, aka the sashimi donburi. I've had this at many many Korean owned sushi joints and it's done very well here. There's plenty of sashimi, and by that I mean every spoonful will have some chunks, there's purple rice, there's plenty of tobiko, and there's a healthy amount of assorted veggies. Their chogochujang (hot sauce), was the right amount of sweet and vinegary. Just a great bowl overall, and for $16 to boot. 

I wasn't feeling like any of the other things on the menu because of the somewhat marked up prices for special rolls and sushi combos. 

They added a 18% service charge FYI. There was no option to add tips anyways, and we were told it was added when we were given the bills so there's no 'trick' here other than the fact it was pre-added. Service was fine, considering how busy it was, there was no major problems, and we managed to get our food, eat, and leave fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Surprisingly happy with the quality of food.  Menu not incredibly huge - but well done.  Food was made quickly.  Service was slightly average.  Saki was hot."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times with both friends and family. Love it all -- the decor, the service, the food, the variety. One of the reviews already posted mentioned to not judge it by its exterior -- that's very true, the exterior sign in particular does not do the restaurant justice. It's very lovely inside.

Cost of dinner for two is usually a little more than I am used to, especially given how much competition there is in the area, but it's near the airport and a lot of large hotels so maybe that's to be expected. Overall a very good sushi restaurant. 

Menu items I can recall we've tried:

- edamame
- wakame salad/sunomono salad
- dynamite roll/avocado roll
- red dragon roll/california roll combination
- sushi pizza
- bomb roll/chicken teriyaki roll
- alaska roll

From what I gather, the sushi chefs at Sushi-ya definitely take pride in their work. I remember once receiving an order arranged as a caterpillar on my plate, and recently, a dragon. I love that. I know it's not an uncommon occurrence in sushi restaurants, but that's something that I really like and appreciate. It tells me they enjoy their work. :)

Suggestions for improvement? Well, perhaps they could have low sodium soy sauce on the tables. I wasn't sure if they offer it, I will ask next time. I personally find their spicy mayo really, really hot and I'm not a novice sushi eater, so maybe they could use it more sparingly. OH! I would also like it (though this is more of a personal preference than a criticism) if they had less tempura and tempura bits in their specialty rolls, and more raw fish and avocado. Just to provide healthier options to those of us looking to avoid anything deep fried, know what I mean?

Well, that wasn't very brief but there you have it!"}
{"text":"Best waitress.
She was very cool and friendly.
It was a pleasure being in Toronto on business and the atmosphere is awesome.
Seemed like a lot of locals showed up and were dropping shots with the chef(s).
I saw some people pick up to go.

We were only in town for a few days but we ate here 2 of the 3 nights.
It did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I have tried this place several times. I always opt for their bento boxes, as you get more of a variety. Their lunch specials are worth the price. 

The Terriyaki+Tempura+Sushi is my go-to. All bento boxes come with miso soup, pickled kimchi, and a nice portion of white rice. 

The ambiance of the place is very dim and relaxed. The staff is super friendly, the place is clean, and the service is fairly quick. The only issue is that it is located in a small plaza, so there aren't many parking spots if the two restaurants there are at full capacity. 

Otherwise, very good & convenient place to eat Sushi and Japanese cuisine, and it's right near the airport!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am near the airport area and I am in the mood for sushi I always come here. Great service, great food. A bit pricier but that's the price to pay for eating good sushi."}
{"text":"Great Sushi place, has a genuine feel to it. Best thing around the Radisson near the Toronto Airport, otherwise you have bland franchise restaurants.. yuck!"}
{"text":"Tried making a delivery order and the lady over the phone was very rude and hateful, I had told her I want 2 orders of sushi and she interrupted me in a rude tone telling me I need $40 worth of food I then told her I was not done ordering and then she hung up. I'm ordering from mr. Kiwi instead"}
{"text":"Was heading to the airport to head home and thought... while I still have my rental car, let's stop and get something other than the crap that is in the airport.

Stopped and did a quick search and found high reviews for Sushi-Ya.  The parking lot was full which should have been an indication right there.  Walked in and there was one person waiting.  There were plenty of tables open, and even the sushi bar, but according to the host the sushi bar was reserved.  Which to me seemed very odd.  Anyways, I was told that there was a table that was just paying for their meal, so she figured about 5 mins wait.  

5 mins and I'm seated.  The place is not that big and has a bit of an odd layout.  Anyways, I told the server that since I had 5 mins waiting, I actually knew what I wanted to eat.  The order was taken, and due to the number of patrons in the place the order came out in an appropriate amount of time.  

My server was very friendly.  Since I was seated close to the sushi bar (not at), the chefs and the wait staff all seem to talk very loudly.  Almost to the point of yelling at each other.  I found this a bit strange, although when you are dining alone, it is entertainment value.  

Got my food, California Roll, Salmon/Avo Roll, and a Sushi-Ya Roll.  All were very well done and very tasty.  The server was back a couple of times to make sure I was ok and to inquire on the food.  

Overall, the wait seemed a bit disorganized, however once inside and ordering the food and service were very good.  The parking lot is pretty small so parking is tight.  No complaints on food or service.  I'm thinking of making it my regular stop when going to the airport to head home. Definitely going back to try some other rolls."}
{"text":"Sushi-Ya is a throughly A-OK Sushi place. (If it's your favourite sushi place in Toronto, you really need to get out more.) The food is reasonably good, but when your competition is giant American chain restaurants near the airport that really isn't saying much. The wait-staff is sometimes friendly, sometimes not. The service is sometimes good, sometimes not. I guess it depends on who you end up getting. They sometimes have a tough time dealing with a busy lunch seating, so it's not the best place to go if you are tight for time on your lunch break. The food is pretty good. They have your typical selection of crazy sushi rolls, and then a mix of Japanese and Korean food. I don't think the prices are unreasonable. So yeah, Sushi-Ya is a thoroughly OK restaurant."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 Service : 9/10 Environment : 8/10 Family friendly : 8/10

Came here just by doing Yelp search for Japanese food around the area. Nice surprise for this small but nice shop. It was for a Saturday dinner for a family of 6 with 2 kids at around 6:30pm and we got booth seats right away but this place got full around 7pm, so reservation is recommended. Food selection is good, typical Japanese restaurant. We ordered sashimi, a roll, a bento box and udon. All the food were fresh and good quality, sashimi selection is typical, no special fish offered but all are fresh and in good portion. For the bento box, they offer organic wild rice, a healthier option. Service is good overall but little bit slow in serving the food which was probably because it was a busy dinner time.

As it was for a birthday celebration, we ordered a dessert and ask the waitress to put a candle  on the dessert. When they serve the dessert, a few waitress came by and sing Happy Birthday, they also offer another dessert \"on the house\" which was a surprise. Basically, I would recommend this place if you're around this area and want to have Japanese food."}
{"text":"A friend and I both had to park our cars across the street. Parking is pretty limited, I guess depending on the moment you get there. By the time I crossed the street to get to the place, there were 3 spots that opened in the front. FML lol... 

I got the tofu meal with miss and salad. It was alright. I really liked my red rice though. It was borderline too moist, but that's how I like my rice, so I really enjoyed it. One of my friend only had half of the small scoop, so I guess he didn't enjoy it. 

I'd say the food was good, but the wait was really long. I'd say it was for sure over 30 minutes and they didn't even bring the plates at the same time. I got mine and what must have been another 15 minutes was when the rest of the table got theirs. Also, they topped off our drink once and that was it. 

I guess they were just that busy. 

I would go back here again if I'm craving sushi in the area."}
{"text":"Love the place! The staff great! I actually  a big sushi lover I am a regular there! I even have big craving for their sushi mmmmmmm Thursday night & Friday  night you can even have a very fun time sake shooter flying !!"}
{"text":"Went here last week to fulfill a sushi craving I had.  It definitely met my expectations.  

I ordered dynamite sushi and it was $8 for 8 pcs.  

They make it right in front of u, which helps to pass time while u wait.  SERVERS were friendly and offered me water while I wait.

I live so close to here and will def visit again!"}
{"text":"The service was quick and the meal was professionally presented.  The sashimi and rolls were very fresh.  The restaurant is small and reminds me of a traditional restaurant from Japan."}
{"text":"Not pleased with my experience at all.  Sloppy rolls and a joke for the shrimp tempura appetizer. The tempura appetizer looked like they scraped up leftovers from someone's plate and put them in my take out box. Didn't touch it for fear of getting sick...didn't loom appetizing at all.  The sushi rolls were sloppily constructed and just thrown together. I get that I ordered take out but put some pride in presentation. At least make the food look like it should be eaten. Ate two rolls and threw out the rest. Such a waste!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the service is really sucks!! They can not even understand English I think, and the food comes up very slow!!guys please read all reviews, lots of 1 star review complaining about the service. don't understand how come they still get 3.5 star in overall. thinking that their employees probably writing reviews for their restaurant"}
{"text":"SushiYa is always a hit. I have been going to this place for over 10 years and have had 100% good eats. You have got to try this out. Yeah it's more that AYCE but quality is quality. And this place knows quality. Check it out and you won't be disappointed. Sushi is my fav meal bar none and this place continues to please non stop. Thanks for yet another amazing meal! (BTW the kids drawings of how much they like the place is a super nice touch. Need more drawings"}
{"text":"I am not a sushi expert so I can't comment whether this is the \"best\" sushi in Toronto (which must be quite an honour), but I can say that this little restaurant tucked almost across the street from a Park n Fly, is a welcome port in any storm, especially when coming off a long flight and landing at the labrynth they call Pearson.

I had a choice of two sushi places that night - this little place or a box-store sushi place close by.

Glad I chose Sushi-Ya.  Intimate, warm, friendly, and good sushi.   I only did take out, but even that was a pleasant waiting experience as I enjoyed a lime flavoured glass of water and a delicious sample of spicy noodle soup."}
{"text":"We stumbled over Sushi-Ya just because it was so close to our hotel. As there was not much around, so we thought to give this place a try.

We were there around 7:30 and the table was for 5 people. There was no wait, but it got crowded really quick due to small space.

The servers were kind and welcoming.

We order Sushi, Rolls and Sashmi. Not expensive at all and we enjoyed the quality, quantity of fish.

Will visit this place again."}
{"text":"Very cute place!  Small, private, quaint and comfortable.  Searched the area for a local sushi place and this one popped up with pretty good reviews.  Great service, attentive and quick with the food. 

The food was fresh and good.  I ordered the green salad (standard fare across sushi restaurants, this was no different, good dressing), hamachi sashimi (very fresh and flavorful) and the red Dragon roll (fresh and clean tasting, although not much flavor).

The only negative was.... there was a charge for a side of sriracha sauce.  I have been to hundreds of sushi places and never has there been an extra charge for hot sauce.  Thought that was ridiculously ridiculous.  I would go back... and just bring my sriracha sauce with me : )"}
{"text":"I'm staying at the neighboring hotel for a convention and wanted some sushi. I followed the other yelp recommendations and ended up here with a great dinner. 

The staff are quick and friendly. The sushi was great... Fresh and good portions. I'd eat here again next time in in town."}
{"text":"Crowded. Unfortunately not nice service. Until I told the truth I'm usually ok but there was no smile and hello the portion  is small for the amount of money I spend"}
{"text":"Our group of 10 had lunch here recently and we were all very impressed with the food, service and ambiance. Such a beautiful restaurant and we were lucky enough to sit near the bar. I can't stress what a charming vibe the restaurant had but we didn't feel like we were out near the airport.

I ordered the Special Bento (tempura + 12 sashimi + 3 sushi) for $18 and it was worth every cent. The sushi/sashimi was so fresh and melted like butter with each bite. They offer this incredible purple rice which I think the server said was organic white rice mixed with something but It was not your typical white/jasmine rice - very unique. This is great place to go just for a casual lunch/dinner and even a celebration as I understand they have a large dining space in the back.

If you plan to come during lunch and you're driving, be sure to come a bit early and the parking can get very tight."}
{"text":"Very friendly sushi chefs and staff, almost homey. Granted, the prices are quite a bit higher than I would expect of a place of this caliber. I left a bit hungry after spending about $40 in food, including one beer. Hrm."}
{"text":"Sushi ya is one of those drive by places that you pass by a lot but seldom stop. I decided to try it our for lunch and got exactly what I expected. The sushi is ok, service is good and the interior is intimate with 3 large booths near the front window and a few booths for two along the side.

For me, the true test of a great Japanese restaurant is the activity at the sushi bar (i.e. are people sitting there, are the ingredients being used by the chefs in plain sight). An aged Japanese business that tends to look a bit rundown, will seldom have any activity at the sushi bar. The thinking goes that they've been there so long that the start to slip on some housekeeping. A drive around the back and a view of the back entrance wouldn't give you the most sterile feeling about their housekeeping. But they do have a Pass sign on the front window. So while the music is loud and modern, the interior could use a refresh.

I ordered the sushi combo A which for $16 provides you with miso soup and a small salad, 6 California rolls, 6 salmon rolls and 4 pieces of assorted nigiri. They didn't seem to have any bento combinations with sushi and say beef or salmon.

Overall I would have given it a 3.5 except that I arrived at 2:00pm and while they sat me and took my order, it was clear that they were preparing for a staff lunch and early afternoon shut down. If you're in the area and want a dark intimate setting, Sushi Ya is more than suitable."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, loved the romantic dim lit environment. We went for their lunch special and was surprised they added wasabi under their sushi as different restaurants don't usually add them in. Parking is tiny. the servers are friendly"}
{"text":"Sushi-Ya is one of those places that really takes pride in the sushi that they serve.  The servers there are always friendly and will always say hello when you walk in and good bye when you leave. This time I ordered the unagi don, which is one of my favourite Japanese meals. The eel was really fresh and the presentation was amazing. Well worth the time it takes for the food to come to the table. 

If you are looking for large portions or a cheap meal this isn't the place to go, but the food is great."}
{"text":"The sushi chefs are still BOSS, loud (in a good way) and entertaining. Some middle-aged couple was sitting up at the bar/sushi chef area, and they somehow got one of the sushi chefs to dance to electro-house for 20+ minutes. It was glorious. (And, of course, the sushi is still amazing.)"}
{"text":"Great find in this area, enjoyed the ambience of this restaurant with dim lighting, large wooden benches, warm hand towels given before your meal, and the miso soup was actually hot and didn't taste like it came from a bag. 

Reasonably priced menu and great service. Would defiantly come back again!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is very relaxed- soft lighting with gentle music in the background. Service was great. I ordered the spicy salmon roll and the crazy roll. My friend ordered one of the dinner combos which came with soup/salad. Timing was great, food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about here. Service was quick and great. Very attentive. Price was great, my entire meal was $37 and that included Miso soup, green salad, 4 pcs of sushi and beef udon plus a glass of wine. Sushi was fresh and delicious. The food presentation was amazing. Watching the chefs prepare the food was entertaining as well. I have just started to love sushi and I'm very picky. I'll be back next time I'm in the area! Very clean restaurant too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new lil sushi spot! The fish is incredibly fresh and melts in your mouth. I highly suggest the volcano roll.  Even the cooked appetizers such as the teriyaki chicken are very nicely prepared. The service is always great, hot towels and all.  

Its a small place but its immaculately clean and cozy. Don't be fooled by the outside it's very nice.  Prices are average for Toronto, its not a steal but worth it. It's located near the airport so its a bit from downtown but if you are out that way you should definitely make a stop."}
{"text":"I ordered Red Dragon roll, Tempura Dinner and Salmon sushi, excellent!

Service was great and friendly, worth every cent.

I recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem near the airport. Will certainly come back each time I am in town. Still not quite sure what we ordered but check out the photos. Delicious. 

The Works and they Crazy Roll are top shelf."}
{"text":"Sushi was great!  Fresh and delicious!  Ordered the large boat and was amazed by the selection. Friendly staff and service was good.  Parking is challenging though"}
{"text":"I stepped in here from the rain and was greeted by a restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere. The decor is nice and the music is calming. The food was quite good. My only complaint was that the salmon sashimi was slightly fishier tasting than I would have liked. However I would recommend the black dragon, that roll was delicious. Very kind staff and overall great experience."}
{"text":"The spicy tuna roll was excellent and the salmon sushi was also very good.  Nice size portions, and my meal did come with a complimentary cup of soup for starters.  Wait staff was friendly and overall service was good.  I'm staying at a hotel on business and this place was a nice little walk from my hotel.  I would go back."}
{"text":"I was craving sushi really badly, and since this was right next to my hotel I decided to try it out. Food was delicious! The service was okay. The waiter had an attitude and was not very polite to begin with. The environment is calming. I would visit again."}
{"text":"Service was horrid, asked for water and then the server never came back. The bill came and it had been tipped with a recommended 18%, I went to tell her that it was too high and I would like to have it reduced. She replies with a yes okay and then proceeded to hand me the card machine. Then on the receipt it turned out she had not reduced the tip at all."}
{"text":"I really like this place. A little expensive but worth it. Lunch is the best option here."}
{"text":"Came with my coworkers for the first time for lunch on a Friday, lucky enough to get a table for 8 without reservation. I got the Crashing Bowl and it was one the the bests I've had! $16 with soup and salad, I'd say pretty worth it! Also, a co-worker got the Benton box and the portion was quite generous"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and every time has been fantastic! Make sure to say hi to Speedy :)"}
{"text":"My 2 sisters and I came to Sushi-Ya Japan with our kids. 6 kids between us. We read great reviews on yelp and wanted to try it.  My sister got there first with her 2 boys to get us a table.  When she walked in and the server saw the kids she gave my sister the rudest look. From there the service went downhill.  Not sure if the lady hates kids but when I walk in she greeted me with a big smile and when she saw my daughter and realized I was with my sister her smile became a frown.  Everyone else that walked into the restaurant she was super nice and happy to greet them with a smile.  She then proceed to inform us that she doesn't care that our kids are young she's still charging us a 18% service charge.  We were going to walk right out of the restaurant but our kids were hungry and it was freezing -20 outside.  We proceed to order our food and was told absolutely no substitution.  I'm like what kind of restaurant is this place?  This are so not flexible.  I asked for hot sauce she told me she had to charge me $1!! WTF?!  I ordered the chicken udon noodle soup for my girls to share and I got the steak bento box.  My sister and her daughters got the tempura, salmon and rice and sashimi bowl.  My other sister and sons got the steak bento box and she got the chicken cutlet with rice for the boys to share.  My nephews are extremely picky eater and the combo came with organic wild rice and they're only used to eating plain white rice. So my sister ask to substitute which I think would be a benefit to the restaurant since I would think organic wild rice is more expensive than plain white rice.  The lady proceed to argue and said no substitution.  I said well the boys are not going to eat it.  The server was like 'we don't have white rice here!\" I looked over at my other sisters sashimi bowl on a bed of white rice and was like umm she has white rice so you clearly serve white rice.  She then gave us a dirty look and said for white rice is $2 more!! Again WTF?! So we had no choice. We all got our food and since the server was pissed about the rice situation my nephews food did not come until an hour later!!!! And they put sesame seeds on the rice. After my sister clearly said they are picky and only wanted white rice. So she asked them to replace it and they looked pissed. Overall DO NOT bring your kids to this place. It's says kids friendly on their site but they HATE kids.  They only reason why they got a 1 star was because the food actually tasted good. Our server ruined our overall experience.  I would not recommend this restaurant nor will I ever step foot into this place.  What horrible service!! I have never experience such a anti-kids place before."}
{"text":"Was told it is the beat sushi place, but I wasnt impressed, I consider it an okay one, miso soup was cold, sashimi slices were thin and didnt taste fresh, the roles were okay but not fully loaded. I give 3 stars for customer service."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food. Customer service is O.K. I found the customer service pretentious but the food was very fresh and tasty.. very high in salt.. but it wasn't over powering to me (I don't mind salt) but my friend found it over the top. He says the customer service is rude.. no thank yous or hi and bye.. Nothing, lol.. but I do recommend it.. the sushi is good and I had the hot sake and I really like the seaweed salad. It's not all you can eat, which I prefer but sometimes it better to do it without. I had better sushi.. but this place is not bad."}
{"text":"Japanese sushi restaurant with delicate decorations and friendly waitress. Sushi boat here was really good"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night at 5pm with a reservation for 6 people since our usual sushi joint was closed on Sundays.  They only hold tables for 15 minutes which I thought was fair.  The place is kind of small so if you're a bigger party I'd suggest making reservations.  The parking lot is small, a few spots in the front (some reserved for neighboring restaurant) and more spaces along the side.  Service was a hit and miss.  When we were looking for the waitress we couldn't find her but she'd randomly show up at times to refill the tea.  Their English isn't that great so to avoid confusion it's best to point on the menu when ordering.  We ordered the medium sashimi boat (tried asking to see if we could get more salmon instead but couldn't... Which was fine).  We also ordered unagi don, seafood udon, spider roll and askana roll.  The sashimi boat was fine, the fish tasted fresh although the slices were thinner than other places we're used to.  The unagi donburi was flavorful and came with a grain/purple rice.  The udon was kind of bland and definitely needed to add the 7 seasoning that they provide.  The rolls were decent sized.  However we still weren't full enough so we ordered the Kenji combo, miso black cod and a spicy fried chicken appetizer.  At the end we were full.  I'm not sure if it's mentioned in the menu or stated somewhere (might've just missed seeing it) but there was an 18% automatic service charge added to the bill.  It came out to about $40/person after tax and tip.  For that price I'll probably go back to my usual sushi place which has better service, and similar food quality."}
{"text":"Found this place close to the airport. It doesn't look impressive from the outside. Parking can be tight. 

Once inside, it was dark and intimate. There were some booth areas to sit at, but small and quaint. Decor is simple, like any Japanese places out there.  

They gave us a hot towel to wipe our hands which is a nice touch. 

Happy:  It came with the usual miso soup and small salad. Love the variety of leaves and the dressing. My tofu veggie came on a hot plate and with wild organic rice (purple in colour) which was chewy and nice - just a small amount. My partner had the chicken katzu dish and he said it was okay. We didn't try any rolls, so we don't know how good it is. 

Not happy:  My main dish was supposed to come with seasonal veggies, but it was the typical bean sprouts, carrots and onions stir fried together. The teriyaki sauce was asked twice and it cost money too. The service was slow for such a small place with three servers. I ended up going up to pay. Listening in, tables around us were waiting to place their orders or to pay too. 

Verdict:  Nothing special about it and their dishes can be pricey for dinner. I wouldn't go back. Maybe for their lunch specials if I was near the airport."}
{"text":"Sushi was great. The atmosphere of the restaurant was quite nice. The staff was nice and friendly. We had a wonderful lunch. Thank you sushi ya Japan."}
{"text":"Packed (good sign).  Waited 10m.  Food was fantastic - my dining partner lived in Japan for a year and was impressed.  Fun atmosphere - nice buzz.  Guys behind the sushi bar have charisma and can drink!"}
{"text":"After reading the bad reviews and checking out the menu, I was pretty sure before I walked in that it was Korean not Japanese. So after sitting at the sushi bar and listening to the chefs and waitresses converse in Korean, I was ready for some less than good sushi and Japanese food. I was disappointed :) It was actually quite good. And the service was excellent, friendly and attentive, everyone there is obviously happy to work there.

I don't order 'rolls' as that is where many Korean sushi places slather on the spicy mayonnaise, and who orders rolls when ordering sushi in Japan? No one. I ordered a plate of sashimi which included tuna, salmon and yellow tail all of which were very good. The 'white tuna' tasted of very recently frozen and was meh. the red snapper had some small tough parts which can happen with red snapper, so why include it in your sashimi plate? I also ordered nigiri sushi of salmon, tuna, sea urchin and salmon roe all of which were very generous and absolutely delicious.

I also had some spicy seafood soup which was good, a couple sapporo beers and some not so great hot sake (not bad just a cheaper variety)

I have no idea what the Korean food is like here (Galbi, Bugolgi, etc.) nor the other Japanese dishes, but the sushi (no rolls) in terms of fish are good if you stick with the nigiri sushi which is less expensive than other sushi places in town and more generous.

Was very lucky to get a spot in the very small parking lot."}
{"text":"Whoa whoa whoa - I am a bit confused as to all the positive reviews of this place?  It is good, but not great.  I would say it is slightly better than some of the sushi you can get in the Annex.  I only say that because the sushi is the right \"bite\" size in terms of the rice, but not the fish (which sort of trails off the entire kaboodle).  The hot dishes are not bad, but again nothing that screams \"amazing!\".  The udon I ordered once was bland and the noodles were stuck together.  Beyond that, this is the type of place where you go if you're craving sushi, and it's close by."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sora Combo and it wasn't exceptional but it satisfied my taste buds with its unique taste. The presentation was well done as well and the service was very nice."}
{"text":"Just finished my meal and both the food and service was excellent! Will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Fresh! Quaint surroundings that makes an occasion special. If you love sushi, you will definitely love Sushi-Ya"}
{"text":"I think the food at this restaurant is Just mediocre . For a restaurant serving food at a high price , it's either the portions are good or the fish quality is superb. Both doesn't apply here .  I went to the restaurant without expectation, and left with a disappointment."}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner.  Ordered the Nabe Udon, California roll, and the small tempura appetizer roll.  I would give this place three stars for the food, but because of the non-courteous service, this place only deserves one.  It started with the lack of chopsticks and napkin at my place setting, not a big deal but you would expect some level of Japanese preciseness and efficiency but alas, no.  I had to ask for chopsticks, then napkin, then refill on tea.  No big deal.  Until the udon came the server proceeded to pour the hot soup broth on over my arm.  She apologized and brought ice and apologized.  Ok it was an accident but tell that to my now welting up arm.   Of course noodles and some of the soup made a mess on the table and drowned the California roll.  The server took it away and cleaned up.  No big deal until they neglected to bring back at least the one or two they drowned freshly made.  Is that too much to ask?  At least they brought back a new udon for me, without spilling it on my other arm so I see that as a positive.  Having a burnt arm while trying to enjoy the food and atmosphere was not my cup of tea.  Oh did I have to remind her for the 3rd time to refresh my cup of tea?  Anyway it was time to pay the bill, no discount, no apology, and I had to actually get up and proceed to the cashier as they seem to have disappeared after dropping of the check. 

I realize that this is not a large chain, perhaps small family run. So, I did not make an issue and I even left a tip.  However, service is key, this is likely the worst service I have ever received from a Japanese restaurant in my entire life.

The Law will NEVER ever return..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sushi-Ya Japan! Their lunch specials are amazing; you get a lot of food for such a great price! The food is always fresh & on time to pick up (I always call ahead for take out) The staff are lovely! They greet you with a smile & the chefs in the back all thank you for stopping by just as your about to leave! Ive never dined in at this establishment & would love to one day; the setting is dim, calm, serene! I highly recommend this place! Ill actually be going here tomorrow for lunch (Again!) :)"}
{"text":"Cool little place! Beautifully decorated and the waitresses are very nice. The Rolls were pretty good, the Samurai was large and filling.  I was in Toronto for business and I was looking for nice quiet place to eat before my return home.  I truly enjoyed it and will return."}
{"text":"Pleasantly Surprised by this little gem of a sushi restaurant near the Toronto international airport .

They have a great variety of specialty rolls, 
\" regular\" sushi options, as well as dishes from the kitchen, which looked really amazing . 

Aside from White rice, they also offer wild organic rice; that has a Beautiful deep purple appearance.
(I didn't order any of it, but it looked so good, that I considered asking a colleague if I could try theirs!)

Although there are a few restaurants nearby, this one has one of the highest ratings for a reason."}
