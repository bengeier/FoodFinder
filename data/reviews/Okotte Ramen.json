{"text":"3.5 stars

This restaurant lets you build-your-own ramen, similar to Deer Garden and other Chinese fish soup places.  Also offers rice dishes and other menu items. 

Food was decent but a tier or 2 below more authentic ramen shops like Sansotei and Santouka.  Would eat here again. 

Food tried: 
Black Truffle Soup Ramen
Garlic Soup Ramen
Deep Fried Chicken side
Deep Fried Tofu side
Wintermelon Milk Tea


 
Service:
Slow, but may be due to restaurant being newer."}
{"text":"Pretty convenient location and good tasting food. Portion was good as well, chewy noodles. We liked three-topping option over the standard two.

We got two orders of the pork bone base, good flavour (though quite bonito-y). Out of the toppings we tried, the tendinous rib and beef brisket were the best (tender and satisfying). Others were Japanese Cha Shu and pork belly. The toppings had their own delicious braised flavours, which added to the soup! We got a side order of the tonkatsu - it was okay.

The combo idea is very similar to Deer Garden, but why not - pretty good way of getting to choose what you want! Also if you like Prestotea, you get a reg-sized choice from a wide variety for $2.50."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Friday with a friend and it was mostly full. I liked the roomy simple interior and all the window blinds were up for lots of light on a rainy day . I read other Yelp reviews before coming here so I stuck to ordering familiar taste combos. 
I ordered the curry soup base, beef brisket and king oyster mushroom ($10.99) and added a hokkaido milk tea for $2.50. Our noodles came out at the same time but mine was missing the beef brisket. After telling our server, he went over to the kitchen and brought out a small bowl of beef brisket then told me to add it to my noodle bowl to make it taste better. Well yeah, that's why I ordered it! The beef brisket was tender and saucy, large pcs of mushrooms and the noodles were more on the al dente side. The curry soup was flavourful too. Bubble tea was just ok as I would expect for $2.50. 
Read their stone pot rice is good too so hoping to try that the next time."}
{"text":"New ramen restaurant around this area. Ramen with lots of toppings to choose from. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Grabage my spicy noodle taste like crap no taste or any kick! Service was ok nothing to complain about. But the food had no taste"}
{"text":"Okotte Ramen, like many other reviewers have already mentioned, have adopted the make-your-own designer noodle menu despite their name suggesting that the specialty is ramen. For a prix fixe, you can select your noodle, two toppings of choice and the soup base. For an additional fee, you can order different snacks to compliment your meal. 

While the restaurant is nothing innovative, a feature that makes this restaurant stand out from the rest is the Presotea drink offerings! For a regular drink (which definitely felt like a large), you only need to add a couple of extra dollars to your noodle entr√©e. 

I ended up ordering the tonkatsu soup base with ramen and cha siu, a passionfruit bubble tea, takoyaki, chicken wings and crab salad. For a shop named after ramen, the soup flavour definitely shows promise. However, if you are looking for a rich heavy soup that you'd find from other popular ramen joints, then I might stray away from this option. The soup is definitely lighter in terms of texture and depth. If you are concerned about the quality of the Presotea, fear not! It is very faithful to the brand and flavour. The appetizers were nothing remarkable, but that's to be expected. 

Located in Richmond Hill, it is an appealing alternative for those living more north who adore the Deer Gardens Signature experience. While this restaurant doesn't have anything that screams amazing, it does do the job of satisfying a noodle craving."}
{"text":"Extremely understaffed. Takes around 35 mins to make the noodles.

Noodles - Only 4 choices - ramen, glass noodles, udon, or rice. The ramen is very sticky (would stick to your teeth). Not authentic at all.

Soup - No taste at all. All the soup bases taste the same.

Toppings - Pick 2 of your choice, 3 pieces of each topping. Toppings were pretty good. The scallops were quite big and juicy, much better than expected. 

Presotea - I don't think they read the label of the order. I asked for no ice in my drink, turns out there's a lot of ice. My mom asked for less sweet, turns out it's extremely sweet.

Chef Papa's is much better in terms of noodles, soup base, and service."}
{"text":"Spotted this ramen shop as I passed by and so interested in finding out what is it like. I ordered a porkbone soup ramen, a side order of chicken wings and a wintermelon  tea with glass jelly. 

Pork Bone Ramen: (score 3/5)
The bowl of ramen appeals good to my eyes and the soup looks thick and rich. The I like the type of ramen that they are serving. It is not too thick but it is not that chewy. The slice of pork, cha siu, is tender and it seems like they have not marinated the beat.  To my impression, it is like the pork bone meat some Asians used to cook soup. On the other hand, the pork belly is torched on the surface and as a result it tastes a slightly better. The egg is quite good, soft like tofu. In my opinion, I feel that the ramen is not authentic.

Deep Fried Chicken Wings: (score 3/5)
It is cooked and crispy, perhaps it is a bit overcooked to me. The outer layer is bit dark brown. Having said that, I could still taste the salt and pepper with the wings.

Wintermelon Tea 
It has not come even after I have finished eating the chicken wings and ramen. I have the waitress a chase in the middle of my meal already. It finally came after my second chase which I did see the drink sitting on top of the counter for a while. 

I would suggest one of the waitresses to improve her service. For example, when I gave her a chase as I saw my drink sitting on the counter, she didn't look at me but responded verbally \"wait a minute\"."}

* deep fried Japanese tofu
Very interesting .. at first thought it was fried potato

* takoyaki
Typical and acceptable

* black garlic noodle
Strongest flavoured soup base of the 3. It's okay but a bit oily.

* ginger noodle
If you didn't tell me, I wouldn't know there's any gjnger in it.

* black truffle noodle
There was a teaspoon of truffle mush on top but not enough to keep the whole bowl of soup tasteful.

Overall I wouldn't recommend anyone to specifically come but if it's in the area ... I may .. definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"I read the review here and saw it only has 3 stars so my expectation was not high.  But it was a present surprise.  Noodles are yummy and drinks are good.  Service is friendly.  I don't know why it only got 3 stars.  It deserves better rating! 

It is not closed to my home but will definitely visit again if I am in the hood."}
{"text":"I like the concept of this place DIY ramen noodles! You get to choose your soup base and two toppings. You also have the option to add a presto bubble tea (regular size) and a side snack if you wish.

The noodles range from 9.99 to 10.99.

I opted for the spicy garlic hell soup level 3 with ramen, japanese chasi and pork belly. The noodles also come with fungus, corn, onion and an egg (so no need to pick as your topping unless you want extra) 

I also got a reg size wintermelon presto tea with grass jelly and a side of chicken katsu.

I really enjoyed the flavourful spicy broth!  It wasn't too overpowering or spicy and I liked the thickness of the broth and chewy-ness of the noodles. 

I found the portions to be generous compared to other ramen places - even tho this place is run by chinese people, this is a good place for ramen fix!"}
{"text":"Yet another ramen place in Richmond Hill, so naturally I had to check it out.  So how would I describe Okotte?  Okotte Ramen is a Japanese version of Deer Garden run by Chinese people.

It is quite funny, it's literally the same concept as Deer Garden but they apply the order sheet concept with add on sides and toppings to ramen instead.  So that being said, it's not very authentic.  Also, I didn't find that many good toppings, and the ramen is average.  Their bubble tea is Presotea, so it's definitely much better than what you would typically get at a noodle place.  Extra noodles are only $2, so it is good if you're hungry.  Their portions here are also larger than standard places.

All things said, food is average with decent value and good bubble tea.  3 stars"}
{"text":"Your Chinese-run ramen joint for cheap eats and okay food. Come here for the $10.00 + $2.50 ramen and bubble tea combo, not for the taste or experience.

3/5 - Food
2/5 - Overall Experience

First off, this is the best deal on cheap eats in the area. They also offer a side dish combo for $2.50 that has selections such as gyoza or donkatsu. The food is okay, nothing special nor authentic. The ramen generally has a Chinese influence to it, such as the braised beef.

Beware, I did find a hair in my ramen, and it ruined my appetite for the meal. The shoyu soup base was alright, though not much can go wrong with that. The pork bone soup base was lacking flavour, and just tasted fatty and oily overall. The noodles were good, though I doubt they were freshly made. The side of deep fried pork was light and crisp, which is good.

The location was pretty much empty on a Thursday night for dinner, which could be a worrying sign. Employees sat at a booth and played on their phones for the most part. This is a borderline 1/5 due to the hair in the food, but the cheap price, and good bubble tea make up for it."}
{"text":"I like this ramen place! Yummy! 

I love that it is just what it says, RAMEN! There are stone pot rice dishes that I would love to try next next time, for sure, but I love the ramen soup bases. There are so many. 

I tried the black garlic soup base and it was good. Psst! You can get BOBA for DIRT cheap, like you get no name brand BOBA but it is PRESO BOBA. You do get one free hot tea already, you know the standard barley tea or green tea. 

The ramen has good portion for meat and other protein (egg with soft gooey yolk) OH my. And you can get side dishes for JUST $2 something (limit of two sides). You could have chicken wings(3), tonkatsu, fried chicken, tobiko salad, fried tofu, edamame, hmm, yeah there's more on their menu. 

I don't care about decor, but if you are, well, it has good ambience. There are booths, tables, good ceiling and lights. 

The service, good people working there. I asked one of the hosts to recommend a soup base for me as I want to try other soup bases. 

Here is what I read: \"shio (salt), shoyu (soy sauce), miso (fermented bean paste), and tonkotsu (pork), which doesn't make particular sense, as the first three are flavorings, while the fourth is the broth base. It's sort of like saying \"there are four basic types of pizza: Neapolitan, Sicilian, New York, and pepperoni.\"  -https://www.seriouseats.com/2013/09/the-serious-eats-guide-to-ramen-styles.html

Okay I'm gonna enjoy the rest of ramen now. 

I got the spicy black garlic hotter than hell one (unsure of exact name) soup base, level 2, with sliced beef and pork slices. They already include egg, black mushroom, and corn. 

FYI: level 2 is not spicy yet. But it is still good."}
{"text":"This is probably my new favourite noodle place. Sure, the taste may not be like that of a 5 star restaurant, but it's close by and the food tastes good.
I did have a first bad impression with their ramen noodles because they tend to cook it a bit on the dense side, which just isn't my preference (a lot of my friends seemed to love it). The second time, I ordered udon and now that's all I order when I go.
They provide you with a variety of ingredient choices its quite amazing how many toppings they give you for a $10 dollar bowl of noodles.
I've always really loved Preso Tea as well, so their bubbletea + noodle meal is absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"This is by far the best ramen I had in Richmond Hill.. price is very reasonable...had the bloody hell garlic soup level 1 which was delicious...d 2 choice of meat was also amazingly tasty and tender..on top of that $2.50 for bubble.tea to cool down after just made a perfect meal.1 star less because the staff needs to learn to explain their menu instead of giving \"I don't know how to explain\" excuse.."}
{"text":"Another of those pick your own noodle places... Definitely not ramen as their name suggests.

Most of their soup bases lack any real flavour and are just really salty. The Spicy Soup is not spicy at all. There was zero taste and was literally just a bowl of coloured salt water. Same with Ginger and Cheese bases. Bloody Hell and Garlic Butter was better, but lacked any garlic taste. You'd be better off with sticking to Pork Bone Soup or Black Garlic. No complaints in terms of noodles and toppings. Avoid the rice though, as it was really burnt and you could taste a heavy char throughout.

I do however, like the idea of being able to add a side dish and/or Presto Tea for cheap ($2.50). Doesn't come with a drink normally though... So I would say it's a little more pricey than other noodle places in the area.

I agree with the other comments about poor service... If you can even call it service. Servers are very inattentive and are usually just in the corner playing on their phones. Aren't really friendly either and seem like they don't really want to be there. There was one time I went with some friends I haven't seen in a while and we wanted to talk a little. It was a week day and the restaurant was not busy. They never refilled our waters and kept talking about us in Cantonese. I think they thought we wouldn't notice or we didn't understand the language... Either way I thought it was super rude. If you wanted to talk about your paying customers, at least wait until they leave! We left at around 9:15pm. As soon as we left, they closed up immediately... Even though they say that they close at 10pm! 

I used to come here pretty often as it's close to work and home, but I feel like they have gotten progressively worse since opening. I'd rather opt for somewhere else to eat now and I don't think I'd be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Had miso ramen with beef brisket and pork belly and a taro drink.  Overall it was a very good meal.   They could speed up service, bowls took a bit of time to come out and the 4 bowls did not come out together and soup was not boiling hot, but enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"So I've come here more times than I would like to admit. This is because of that promo on ccue where you could choose 10% off the entire bill or choose to add a side order AND an additional ramen topping. I chose the latter.

Soup and ramen are hot, similar temperature so I was very happy.

THE TOPPINGS. Ok, so they give quite a lot. A ramen is $10 here, $11 if you choose a special base. They give three halves of an egg! And three slices of chashu! And a good spoonful of the other pork. Just this propelled the rating to 4*.

I loved the ramen texture. It was chewy and did not melt or disintegrate in your mouth. That's how it should be! Quite filling, even if you don't drink the soup.

I love that they partnered with presotea. You  choose any drink for $2.50 and you can even request no/less ice/sugar.

I don't incorporate service in my reviews of Asian places, so if you're expecting servers to converse with you as you are slurping your noodles, this is not the place for you.

Definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"New opened ramen place on lesile across from the Staples building. Order the ramen with 1 side and a bubble tea. Good value for only $2 for one side and $2.5 for bubble tea. The 2 pork belly are huge compare to other ramen places. Wife and I came out with a full stomach. They also have other rice meals which we may try next time. Or we may try the ramen again with a different soup base. 10% VIP card were given and we will definitely come back. Pls keep it up. We need more good restaurant around major mack  and 404 area."}
{"text":"If you drop the expectations of an authentic ramen joint and come take it for what it is, you wont be disappointed this noodle restaurant. 

It's generally a Chinese noodle restaurant where you can choose your own toppings, soup base, noodle type, sides, and drink for a set price. The difference between this and deer garden/chef papa is the choice of soups, sides, and toppings are more \"japanese inspired\" with stuff like cha-siu, pork belly, and comes with a soft-boiled egg. You can also get takoyaki as an extra side for $2.50.

The side takoyaki tastes good, it just lacks the presentation. The wings don't really feel worth it for $2.50 since they're pretty small. I found the option to add a bubble tea for $2.50 to be pretty decent as there was a pretty big menu to choose from. 

I chose the spicy ramen and liked it- huge portions of meat (the brisket was tender and HK style), soup had flavour and noodles weren't the star but whatever. The table beside me got some sort of sizzling pot of food which I'll probably get next time. Solid spot."}
{"text":"Sorry, I can't recommend this place for ramen lovers. The soup and ramen noodle do not blend, and the after-taste of the latter is like flour and powder. It's two starts instead of one as surprisingly its tako-yaki was good with big chunky piece of octopus in each."}
{"text":"We came here last week after hearing good things about it. The ramen was pretty decent, tho the more well known specialty ramen places still beats it. However, the good news is they provide a better selection of good quality noodles, toppings, and sides. Also, they offer Presotea for just $2.50 extra, which makes it a really good deal. I had the cold milk tea with grass jelly. Even with less sugar, it tasted fairly sweet. The tea flavour was good and strong. Service was courteous but rather slow for our table of 8. By the time the last bowls came, half the table had finished eating. So, if I had to break it down: 2.5 stars for the service, 3 stars for the food, and 3 stars for the drink quality. Note, they don't seem to have some of the drinks that other Presotea places have, such as fruit flavour (eg mango) slush. Overall, it was pretty good and I would return again."}
{"text":"I came in here optimistic and walked away.......ok! Its hard to describe, as this place has its pros, and then it also has its cons. Overall I would say this place is a very solid OK, at least with the noodles.

I like the idea of this place, which is similar to deer signature garden where you can select your own noodle mix. You select your noodle broth, noodles, toppings and if you like for a bit more you can get a bubble tea (presotea) and a side dish.

The noodle bowl itself came out OK. They have some interesting flavors for a bit more money, such as truffle, curry, garlic butter to name a few but unfortunately the actual taste of the broth is still largely pork bone based. I would say skip the disappointment, as the flavors seem like they take the pork broth and just throw in some curry powder, or some garlic butter AFTER the fact as the \"special flavors\" dont really come through that distinctly, so its not worth the extra money.

The bubble tea is quite tasty, definitely presotea level if you like them. The noodles themselves are quite ok as well, and they do seem to have some other interesting dishes, such as a eel rice stone bowl.

I will come back to try out their other dishes, and if in the area would not hesitate to come here to eat, and I would tell people to definitely give this place a try but I dont think I can tell people to travel very far to give this place a try. Its quite decent, but not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"I've been twice and everytime I go, something is uncooked. They do a bad job at heating up either the noodle or the meat. Doesn't taste good either. For that price I would go somewhere else. Deer garden does a much better job on Hwy 7 imo. The tea is not bad though. Won't return."}
{"text":"Great food, great value, close to home.

No complaints here. I discovered this place after driving by and noticing the word RAMEN so close to home.. the store front is honestly very hidden and hard to find.. but I later found this place on Yelp.

I have come here twice so far and ordered the pork bone soup broth with Japanese ramen ($9.99).. the broth is very flavourful and delicious.. I like that it is not overly salty. This place has a concept very similar to Chef Papa at Hwy 7 and Kennedy.. you get to pick your own soup base, toppings, noodles and add any sides.. though I believe they are mostly ramen-based milky soups.

This place is very generous on toppings.. I have ordered anything from chashu to mussels and it seems like they give you three decent-sized pieces of each! I have also added the takoyaki side $2.50 for 3 pieces and it is honestly not bad for the price.

The only difference between this place and Deer Garden/Chef Papa is that it does not include a drink for the price. You do, however, have the option of adding a Presotea drink for $2.50.. which is a pretty decent deal! 

2/2 times I have come here one or both of the tapioca was not ready.. you can either wait or they are happy to let you substitute with any other toppings!"}
{"text":"Not a typical ramen place as you get to choose your own soup base, noodles, and toppings of your choice. The flavours were great, but the ramen portion was unbelievably small..which ultimately resulted me in not considering to come back again next time. 

Presotea was pretty good here. Maybe I can just come in for the BBT, but definitely not for a $10 ramen that feels like a snack and requires me to eat something else after."}
{"text":"Probably the worst ramen restaurant I've been too. The service was non existent. The waiter is always in the corner playing with her phone. 

The food in my opinion was not good. They have a self built ramen concept. Where you select your own soup base, toppings and type of noodles. 

This is not the typical Japanese ramen restaurant. 

The flavour of the broth seems to be lacking. I got the pork broth. The broth was light and seemed watered down but salty. The Japanese char siu was dry and burnt. The pork belly was okay, not bad. The egg was decently made. But overall, the bowl of ramen reminded me of T&T frozen ramen. 

As for drinks. They offer presotea bubble tea. But the bubble tea here is flavourless. We ordered the winter melon tea. It tasted a little odd and watered down. Barely any flavour or sweetness. There was also chunks of wintermelon inside. Not sure if this is normal. But when I usually get wintermelon at other places. The drink is smooth and does not have wintermelon chunks. 

Overall. Totally not worth your money. Service is not attentive. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall. There are definitely room for improvement. One thing you need to know: Stone pot rice bowl saved this place's ass.

The concept is just like Deer Garden where you build your own noodle bowl by selecting your soup base, toppings and type of noodles. The menu offers 12 types of soup bases (ranges from $9.99 to $10.99) and 5 types of noodles. Side dishes are additional $2.50 and a large Presotea is also available for $2.50 when you build your own noodles (not applicable to the stone pot rice bowls or udon dishes on the main menu).

The down side in creating your own bowl is that not every soup base pairs well with ramen noodles IMO. E.g. Their Black truffle soup base does NOT pair well with ramen noodles. Black garlic soup and Pork bone soup were a bit better but definitely not as heavy and flavourful as neighbouring ramen spots in the Markham/Richmond Hill area. Nonetheless, it is a good spot if you are craving for noodles and want a lighter soup base.

Pro:
Instead of noodles, I would recommend their stone pot bowls - it comes out piping hot and I love how the stone pot keeps the food hot throughout the meal :) The one with curry beef brisket on rice was my favourite - it was very delicious and flavourful. The beef briskets were soft and tender. I would order this again and try a few more.

The whole grilled squid with eel sauce was very tasty. Be sure to squeeze the lemon juice on top! It enhances the flavours! The squid is quite large, great for sharing at the table!

Con: 
I would not recommend the side order of corn salad. The kernel skin is harder to chew on and lacks flavour... perhaps frozen corn? Need to confirm. I would prefer the can of peaches and cream corn from the grocery store. #truth

I would also not recommend the Korean crystal noodles... it gets really soggy after a while."}
{"text":"Decor: modern, clean. 
Service: not bad, our server was quite helpful and put good effort into explaining us different options of our menu. 
Food: Takoyaki: good. Gyoza: good. Ramen: good effort, but the broth was a bit watery and noodles themselves were a disappointment. Texture was all wrong and there was no flavour to them. This is quite sad, because all other ingredients were good and cooked properly (egg was perfect). I hope they can improve on broth and noodles and i would recommend this place without any hesitation. One personal suggestion: start serving sake and beer!"}
{"text":"Good value, large portions and the basic ramen starting at 9.99 already comes with a well marinated half egg , corn , wood ear fungus and your choice of 2 toppings , soup base and noodles .

you can add side dish at a special price of 2.50 and you can add a Presotea drink at a discounted price.

Don't expect your overpriced hipster ramen decor experience and you will be extremely satisfied . they have other rice dishes as well."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner at around 9 so there's not much people inside the restaurant..We ordered five ramen and one stone rice and it took forever to come :/ even the ramen wasn't that good compare to other ramen places.. my overall experience here would actually be average"}
{"text":"Tried this place out a couple of weeks following its opening, and I expect it to become quite popular despite it's non-ideal location.

The menu is quite similar to other trendy ramen places, where you have the choice of soup base, noodle, and meats (2 choices). I went with the Spicy garlic option, with level-3 spiciness, and pork belly, pork, and additional boiled egg. This was as good as Sansotei and Kinton in my opinion, and came with slightly more options and larger serving size. Although I did not partake, there was an additional food menu with lots of other snack/meal and drink options.  

This place is big enough, but may become crowded soon if it becomes as popular as I expect it to. I'll be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Raman resturant in this area have become overwhelmingly popular. The issue is, there are so much of it that it's hard to choose from. If you are going to start a business with Raman, you need to have something that's special to that that restaurant. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The Raman is the same as other place. (Most likely bought from factory) I got a Japanese shou and beef slice. Nothing special. The beef slice are store bought and the Japanese shou is dried and not very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is the Deer Garden of ramen. You pick your soup base, toppings, and noodles for 9.99 (10.99 for certain soups). You can add sides and/or a Presotea bubble tea for 2.50 a choice. 

I had a curry base with ramen noodles. For toppings I had the beef brisket and pork belly. Although not as good as some other dedicated ramen places, I was surprised how much I liked my bowl. The brisket was marinated and both it and the pork belly were very soft. The noodles had a nice chewiness to them. The curry soup was not at all spicy (as they indicated in the menu), but had a smooth richness to it. I will keep this place in mind next time I'm in the area and looking for somewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Okotte Ramen A new Ramen joint has simple conception as Chef Papa where you can custom made your own perfect bowl and with $2.50 a choice of any Presotea

Spicy Soup + Tenderous Ribs + Shitaki Mushroom + Japanese Ramen ($9.99)

I like the ramen as it was cooked perfectly with a nice bounce! The soft boiled egg also cooked with the perfect yolk. Sadly the ribs was cold inside...

I would not come here for authentic Japanese ramen experience but ok as a noodle joint. They have some special soup base: Black Truffle, Basil and even Ginger may worth trying

Passionfruit Tea was a little sloppy as there was still couple of seeds in my drinks, that meant it was fresh fruit but did not strained out all the seeds before making my drinks."}
{"text":"This place is like the love child between a Deer Garden copycat and some wannabe Japanese foodie. 

I ordered the make your own ramen with black truffle soup, udon, pork belly and fish cakes. The broth was so oily and salty. The udon was scarce and the pork belly was charred and hard. 

Not worth the $11, folks. 

Also, they sell Presotea drinks. Meh."}
