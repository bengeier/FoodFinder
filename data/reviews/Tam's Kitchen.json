{"text":"Trust me, you will be very disappointed. I would give this place no star if there was an option.  I am a Pho lover, and tried this restaurant last week out of curiosity. We ordered a chicken curry and a beef Pho soup. The curry is very thin and I have no idea whether the soup made with real beef bone soup or just a instant condensed bone dust soup. This reminded me of a only restaurant in fort mcmurray that provides Vietnamese Pho .   There are so many great Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary area, but definitely not this one. All I said is based on my real experience. please judge by yourself. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Rarely have I encountered such brazenly rude and spiteful \"customer service\". After two items we ordered failed to arrive, we asked for the food to be brought out. They first insisted the food had been provided, which they then admitted was false. They had promised to provide the food, which I followed up on after waiting a further half an hour. This was when I was told that I would have to pay, again, for the food that had never arrived. At this point, I was so angry that my appetite completely died, much like my aspirations to ever eat from this place again. I'm almost in disbelief that such inequality could happen in a legal business establishment.  Formerly a loyal customer, Never Again."}
{"text":"The worst Vietnamese food I have ever had and it's way over priced.  They charge $17 for garlic shrimp with steamed rice.  The shrimp were tiny and the rice looked like it's been sitting out all day and then heated up.  The vermicelli barely any veggies and the flavour tasted stale.  Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
