{"text":"I am torn with my review of this establishment. My Hubs and I love to support local businesses and this is very local for us and we really, really wanted to like it. The hard working owners and staff are wonderful and the restaurant is very clean, but...   We didn't like the food. I have eaten at a lot of Vietnamese restaurants and this one did nothing for me.   We shared the spring rolls, I had the bun thit nuong (rice vermicelli bowl) and my Hubs had a sub. The spring rolls were boring, my noodle bowl was bland and the sub had very few toppings. Note: They are not licensed.   If this were a chain restaurant I would have given it 2 stars, seeing how it is independently owned, gets another star in my books."}
{"text":"Really just tried this place as its close to my house.   At work I loved Vietnamese food near sunridge!  Well here is just as good so glad I tried it!   Had beef vermicelli with spring rolls. Delicious just wish I'd been offered the Hoisin sauce to take out like I would of in Calgary. Next time I will ask.  It was fast hot and regular price can't wait to go again. The place was clean and service was good"}
{"text":"The spicy seafood noodle soup comes in a huge bowl for the best price in town, great taste, great staff. Will come back very soon"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and delicious! Always great service and consistent quality. Best Vietnamese food in Airdrie by far!"}
{"text":"I am sick and so I wanted some chicken noodle soup but with the weather being sub -20c out, I opted for the extra money for delivery and tip. (delivery is free over $25, don't forget the tip LOL) (having a sick stomach  may affect my review.) Great price, and the spring rolls were good. I wasn't completely satisfied with the taste of the chicken noodle soup, but the portion was large.  That is all I can say from this one experience."}
{"text":"Wow. The place we wanted to go for dinner tonight was closed, so, based on \"star rating\" , we chose Vietnamese Western Cusine... and regret it, painfully. I never leave yelp reviews; this is actually my first; but this needs to be said.  First off - my wife had vegetarian spring rolls. They were tiny portion sizes, and barely had filling... the little filling they did contain was just shredded carrot.  I had beef pho, and asked for extra meat, and I am SO glad I did. I got about 6 pieces of beef total... what the hell would normal be? What is this, pho for ants? Seriously though.  My wife had chicken pho, and it contained about 3 pieces of chicken.   We left severely disappointed, super hungry, and having wasted money.  The server was friendly though.. Food was terrible, lacked flavor, and portions were intended for small children on a starvation diet."}
{"text":"I've tried their soups and vermicelli dishes, both dining in the restaurant and (more frequently) take out. It's good quality and inexpensive, perfect for my \"I'm not going to cook tonight\" moods.   Evening staff are very friendly and great with kids."}
