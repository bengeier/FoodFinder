{"text":"I guess you can say that this place deserves higher since it is the only game in town but I cant really say its good thai food.  It is just like any other place you get thai food from but I guess if you are fixin for some pad thai, there is no other place to get it.  These are the same people that owned ricky lys next to Marc's in stow on 91."}
{"text":"Consistently good.  We mainly get takeout for convenience.  Their signature pad thai is nowhere near as sweet as most pad thai which, to my palette, is perfect.  I've never had a bad dish there - yellow and green curry, geng paa, pork curry fried rice, and pad thai are my usual rotation.  After a few orders, they will generally honor a request for \"thai hot,\" if you like spicy food.  The only reasons why they don't get 5 stars is that the food can get really greasy (we generally ask for low oil) and because the reservation/order desk staff tend to to get panicky and forgetful when the lobby fills up."}
{"text":"Second attempt. Second disappointment. We tried this place once before and didn't even stay. It was crowded and we were pushed to a small table in the middle of the room. That was after a very long wait.

Today we tried it for take out. General Tso's chicken, Prik-Pao chicken, chicken spring rolls, chicken fried rice. The Prik chicken is the only reason this is a 2 star. Otherwise, a 1 for sure. The spring rolls were squishy and we couldn't finish them. A couple bites into the generals chicken and it was obvious that the meat was dark and grissley and 90% breading. Just bad. The rice, well if we ate it when it was fresh maybe it would have been okay. But it was certainly not fresh. 

We absolutely will not be trying this place again. I suggest you don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed at this restaurant.  We stopped by when we were really hungry. I can see  a lot of people in that restaurant, butty there's no one serving us in 20min. Finally there's someone who is really nice but then the food was unacceptable....."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT I have been going to Pad Thai since I was a child for my birthday! Love love love the spicy peanut curry with squid! Absolutely my favorite in Akron.

Also the calamari is a great appetizer!

High end and high class - yum yum!"}
{"text":"So, I went here for take out on a Friday night.  It was the closest Thai place I could find and had good yelp reviews. I picked up pad see ee, for roughly 12 dollars (alittle pricey).  The dish had very generous portions.  However, the sauce was extremely watery and tasteless.  That night I developed nausea and vomiting.  I considered going back and asking for a refund, but I still get sick thinking about the place.  

Taste 1/5
Decor 2/5

{"text":"As of 09/14/2015 This place is horrible! I didn't like the food took it back to them because the food had a very uncooked taste then I ordered another dish, the chef and owner I think came outside to me and verbally attacked me saying I was making this up. I barley had two spoons of the food and put it back down. The least you could do was give me another dish and I would be on my way. I didn't want to argue so I just left.  I paid $32.00 and walked away with no food, I was visiting from Seattle definitely will remember this horrible experience. DO NOT eat here save your money go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and amazing booth sizes! Friendly, to the point service with a relaxing atmosphere  and great big menus! Only downside is no kid menus and crayons for the kiddos! Other than that, a must go!"}
{"text":"First time customer. Ordered pho soup,  crab ragoons. Pho soup was terrible!  Raw onions,  mystery meat along with beef. The pho soup at giant eagle is leaps and bounds over this! And that's giant eagle. Crab ragoons were unlike anything I've ever seen. Not traditional, although usually frozen. Seemed homemade.  For $14 for pho soup I expected better. I'd save my $ and go elsewhere. Would not good back. Food over priced and over rated."}
{"text":"I have always had great food, good service and excellent sushi from here! We like to get it as take out most times due to having young children we don't want to take into public lol, but on occasions we do get to eat in you realize everything is even better!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai is a very good Thai restaurant located on 91 on the south side of Hudson. You can enjoy their food either in their restaurant or via takeout in your own home. I've never eaten in the restaurant, but I have gone inside and it feels like a more refined atmosphere. It looks classier than your typical Thai restaurant. Personally, I like it. The food is very good, although not outstanding. My most recent meal from here was the Mango Chicken. It was mixed with a variety of vegetables and pineapple in soy sauce. I thought it was very good, although there was too much pineapple for what was in the dish. It's more of a savory dish w/  the exception of the mango sauce which isn't very noticeable with the soy sauce, so the pineapple was a little overpowering. I did like the dish a lot though. Overall, if you're looking for good Thai food in Hudson or the surrounding communities, with another location in Fairlawn, Pad Thai is the place to go."}
{"text":"Went here last night and was sat immediately. Our server throughout the whole time was extremely rushy. As soon as she took any order she was almost to the other booth. She was nice but the rushy aspect didn't help. The sushi was good the food was ok. Wouldn't not go back but also wouldn't go out of my way either"}
{"text":"Had lunch here while visiting relatives. Restaurant was airy and clean. Service was pleasant, accurate and prompt. Food was better than average with very ample portions (and we eat a LOT of Thai!) All in all I would recommend them if you want some good Thai in this area."}
{"text":"I went with couple of my friends. I ordered Ma Po Tofu but tasted like paint - yes - paint the one which goes on the walls. Waiter who was Asian wasn't' pleasant at all. He never smiled ones or was courteous or patience while we placed the order ( he was constantly checking on nearby white-skinned patrons smiling and engaging in chats with them). No it wasn't crowded at all. It isnt the first time we experienced the cold shoulder from this particular waiter ... My overall experience wasn't great considering taste of food and cold hospitality."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. We have been eating here since the day they opened and tonight the owner/chef basically called us a liar when we called to complain. We ordered Savan chicken which has mushrooms, red bell pepper, green beans, and Asian eggplant with chicken and received a bowl of chicken only not one vegetable. When we called to inform them Molly was very nice and said she would check with the owner about a credit and called us back to say the owner prepared the dish himself and it had vegetables in it. If we wanted to drive 20 minutes back and return the dish they would replace it. We will never go there again."}
{"text":"Over the past several months we have ordered takeout a few times. The food has been delicious and consistent. Our sit-down experience must have been an off night."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food! Where else can you order sushi and thai food in one place. I love this place. I usually spend my time speaking Thai with the Sam the sushi chief. You will love this place too."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food and sushi selection! I've eaten at Thai restaurants all over the country and Pad Thai ranks with the best of them. I've never gotten anything that I've been unhappy with; the curry dishes, sushi, appetizers, and noodle dishes are all wonderful. The wine selection leaves something to be desired, but the food it truly some of the best."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Just your regular basic Thai restaurant. My favorite item on the menu is the chicken satay on a stick appetizer. Their chicken pad Thai is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Well I've been a long customer of Tong Tong Chinese restaurant. I wanted to give Pad Thai a try since I live so close. My first trip, the food was good but service was not that great. Continuously asking for things that I felt should have been automatic with the meal and also had to ask for water a few different times. Not to mention the waiter did not even bring a pad and a pen to the table and had to ask us 3-4 times to repeat our orders. Other than that it was ok. The second time I was there, I had ordered take out. Only fried rice and crab rangoon, it was good but the older asian man at the register was very rude. I still tipped $2.00 on a $16.00 take out order. But apparently he felt his rudeness was worth more than that because the next day i noticed on my bank account he added another dollar to my total. My dumbass still gave them another chance and called for another take out order. This time I ordered general tso's chicken. It was the worst. When I opened the dish I thought it looked quite dark...it was burnt. Almost as if they scraped the grill...little black flakes and all...I give up! As a rule I give people 3 tries...strike 3, you're out."}
{"text":"I've been to Pad Thai several times with coworkers for lunch.  We usually go with a fairly large and picky group with several dietary restrictions.  The variety on the menu allows everyone to find something they like and can eat, which is nice.  The restaurant is usually very cold, so take a sweater.  On our last visit, I had the curry fried rice and hot and sour soup.  The rice was good and very spicy.  The soup was probably the best hot and sour soup I've ever had.  Overall the food is good and the portions are generous.   We've always had good service, but the restaurant is mostly empty every time we go."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here, and I am not impressed. 
I went on my lunch break and ordered tofu with broccoli, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms. The waiter repeated it back to me, and it seemed fine. When the food arrived, it was tofu with beans, peppers, and onions in a spicy sauce (some of my least favorite vegetables). The waiter even told me 'sorry they got the order wrong', but he gave it to me anyways. 
Normally I would have said something, especially because I am not good with spicy foods, but I didn't have time (I had to get back to work). I understand if someone had messed it up, but they should have offered to get me the correct meal. 
The entire entree was different than what I had ordered."}
{"text":"We've eaten sushi all over the US (even NYC) and this is the best sushi you can get anywhere!   We don't go for the cooked sushi (tempura) or the cream cheese stuff - only the real sushi and sashimi - no place else has a better selection or taste!  Wait staff is great and really attentive.  If you are looking for an authentic sushi experience - this is place."}
{"text":"Whenever my bf and I are craving Thai/Chinese we go here. It's a little high priced for one plate, but the amount is good, we always take home leftovers. My complaint about the place is probably the owner. Twice I have been there with the owner almost yelling at his employees. If he's mad everyone can hear why and what's going on. It's a nice atmosphere, relaxing, so I don't think people want to hear his problems. If he would learn to talk to his employees in the back that would make this place really good. I've heard the sushi is great, I haven't tried though."}
{"text":"Outstanding. National caliber. Consistent quality. Be sure to try the house desert."}
{"text":"Finally - some fantastic sushi!!  The tiger roll and spicy crab roll were excellent and the best sushi I've had since we moved.  My husband enjoyed their spiciest curry and we both mmmm'd over the Thai iced tea.  

  This place is beautiful and there is plenty to look at.  It is so open but private at the same time.  The bar is beautiful, too.  So much gorgeous decor!

  Service was a little slow, especially for a pork curry which I wouldn't think would take too long but it was a weekend night so perhaps the kitchen was just that overwhelmed.  I saw when my sushi was done and that was super fast.

  As a plus, when I'm not cheating, there are many vegan/vegetarian options and even coconut ice cream!  We're going to have to come back just for a vegan dessert some time.

*Update:  I'm sorry but I have to take this one down.  We had SUCH terrible service here on our last visit that I don't even know if I want to go back.   It was at least 20 minutes before we got our thai iced tea; his soup was long gone by the time my spring rolls (which were gross) arrived; I just finished the last bite of my sushi when his curry came.  It was ridiculous AND we both felt sick after.  They weren't even busy.  not sure what happened."}
{"text":"I love the sushi here.  The quality of the fish is stellar, the technique of the sushi chef (Ming) is perfection...  My husband and I go here at least once a week, maybe twice.  No place else better to sit besides the newly added sushi bar!  Some sushi places are cheesy and dishes from the full menu are very \"Americanized\" but everything here is TASTY!!!!  Definitely a great spot!  Favorites: Salt & Pepper Squid, Viengs Roll (sauce on the side), Hamachi Kama (delish)!!!"}
{"text":"The experience eating here is nice, since the decor and room layout is great with a lot of loyal customers.  For Thai, I prefer more authentic, \"hole in the walls\" personally, but the vibe here is positive and food presentation is great.  Just come here expecting American Thai.
The service is great and I got the Thai Spaghetti, which was flavorful with a lot of ingredients, including basil, peppers, chicken and shrimp."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I went for early dinner place was empty service was slow when my girls dish came she did not like the taste of it The server came by and asked if everything was OK my girl told her she did not like the taste of the food instead of saying I am sorry the server says what's wrong with it my girlfriend said she did not like it and tasted funny the server had an annoyed look on her face and again never apologized.  When I asked for the check she never removed the bad meal off the bill not a fan of this place"}
{"text":"Thai is definitely one of my favorite cuisines.  I like my food to have lots of flavor, and thai food (if done properly) delivers just what I like.  Pad Thai is a solid option for Thai fare in the Kent area.

The boyfriend and I went here on a whim, searching for a new restaurant in the Kent area.  He chose his usual dish, pad thai, and reported that it was well-executed.  I ordered the vegetarian curry fried rice.  Now, I'm sure you could argue that you can't really judge a Thai restaurant on their fried rice alone, but I beg to differ.  Many, many places somehow manage to botch fried rice.  This place, however, presented an excellent dish.  Robust flavors, not greasy, good helping of vegetables, great portion size.  Just what I was looking for that evening.

I am looking forward to going back again to try more dishes, especially the Tom Yum soup which is, hands down, my favorite Thai dish.

Pad Thai also serves sushi, which I did not try, but probably will on a future visit."}
{"text":"A lot of my lunches are from pad Thai. They have neat options and the food as 95% times good. Sometimes they mess up like other places. But I definitely go there once a week."}
{"text":"Six ladies enjoyed dinner at Pad Thai last night. I had a glass of Kenwood White Zinfindel ($6.00) and their Governer's chicken dinner ($12.95). The portions were huge and I ended up bringing home plenty of leftovers for tonight."}
{"text":"Service is consistently bad - they just don't have enough staff on any particular shift. Which is sad as the ambience is nicely retro  and the food can be good. Had to repeatedly ask for an adjustment on my bill as I was served the wrong item. Very slow. Carry out is your best bet."}
{"text":"Extremely horrible experience !! Very rude manager and staff !! Carry out food was horrible and insipid !! Every item was stuffed with Tofu and the Thai rolls and rice were cooked in stale oil a perfect receipe to throw up !! On asking to fix the problem the manager and staff fought us !! So distasteful and POOR class and so much for spending $100 !! Any other restaurant in Hudson would have apologized and fixed the problem !! Noble House still maintains high quality and class in Asian dining !! 
Dee !!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had to give this place one star to post, otherwise it would be zero. Four of us went to this place about two years ago. We decided to finally check it out for it's sushi bar. We ended up being very let down. The waiter completely ignored us. After a long wait we complained about the service to the front desk when he was nowhere to be found. No one stepped up as manager to deal with the issue, instead everyone started to play the blame game.  The waiter then denied ever ignoring us and we had to yell to pay for what we did eat, only an appetizer, so we can leave. No resolution was ever made and we never went back."}
{"text":"Not the greatest Thai food. I was really craving curry and was really disappointed with what I got."}
{"text":"I have been dining here for years. Food and service always good. But, this visit I was totally surprised at how filthy the dining room was. Floors and carpet dirty, as were flat surfaces. Debris under all tables. If the front of the house was this disgusting I am afraid of how bad the kitchen is. I will not go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I did our usual when trying a new Asian eatery and ordered lots of takeout to share, and we were really happy with the results. We ordered the fresh basil roll (heavy on the basil and slightly different than described on the menu -- ours had carrot and cucumber rather than avocado -- but still really good), minced chicken wrap (soooo good), crab Rangoon (meh.. average - the only thing I wouldn't order again)), Thai salad (huge, fresh and yummy), moo goo gai pan (normal asian-american version, but yummy fresh ingredients) and something else I don't recall. We were very pleased with the overall quality and freshness of the food. I also loved the atmosphere of the restaurant when I went to pickup -- I'd love to eat here one day and check out all of the amazing decor and the habachi area -- and their customer service was nice, too."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great Asian fusion place since I moved back to Ohio, and I think I've found it at Pad Thai! I got the red curry - it was delicious and the tofu was cooked perfectly, which is rare. 

We also tried the chicken satay appetizer, and they was good, as well. 

The atmosphere inside the restaurant is charming and a little more dressy than casual, but we sat at the bar. They also have a pretty extensive cocktail menu - I'd like to try something on it the next time I go."}
{"text":"I love Tai food so I was excited to have a restaurant open so close to my home. Our first visit was my last however. I can't get the image out of my head, the waitress removing the plate and unable to because a wad of chewing gum was on the bottom of the plate! I honestly don't remember how the food was. I do know the bill wasn't adjusted nor an apology from the manager. They will also lie about ingredients. My daughter went with a group of friends and asked if they used MSG. The waiter said no. One of her friends told the waiter, you do know she can die if you are wrong. The waiter then admitted they did. If you have food allergies, steer clear!"}
{"text":"First and last time visit... Sushi was not fresh and the salmon was chewy. I couldn't force it down if my life depended on it. When I told our server about the fish, he was rude and told me that he wouldn't take it off my bill. I didn't even eat one piece. When he brought over another roll, it was straight off the sushi bar, wasn't fresh and I couldn't bring myself to eat another bite. I will never go back... Ever! Do not recommend this place and if i could've given a negative five stars... I would've."}
{"text":"I had the Siam curry last night. It was my second try at a curried dish. It's was flavorful with just enough heat. My waitress said it was medium heat. I may want to kick it up a notch next time. 

The fresh basil rolls I had prior to my meal were on point!  Lighter than an egg roll, it contained fresh greens, basil, and shrimp. I do like shrimp!  The dipping sauce was light too but a nice flavor that didn't over power the roll."}
{"text":"I eat here often and I've generally liked my meal.  Today I ordered Pho which I've enjoyed at other Vietnamese restaurants as well as Americanized Asian restaurants.  The menu states that \"PHO\" is a \"Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup\" with \"rice noodles, bean sprouts, and slices of beef, served in a rich beef broth,\" garnished with fresh basil (Pho usually includes fresh cilantro).  Everything was on par with other restaurants until I bit into a slice of ROUND SAUSAGE.  I'm not joking!  Instead of rare, juicy beef slices they had supplemented MORE THAN HALF of the meat with what one would cook at a tailgate party on a grill.  The noodles were pre-cooked and added to the bowl of onion broth by tipping the small bowl of noodles into the broth (they were still cold and coagulated in a solid form until I separated them with my fork).  Tons of large sliced onion also inundated the soup (which shouldn't have been included!)  The soup was NOT PHO - it seemed to be left-overs served from the cheap dregs of the kitchen.

The next time I pay $12.95 for a bowl of soup it will be authentic soup - not something that was scrabbled together with ingredients that the restaurant had \"on-hand\".  

This place is lovely if you're expecting Americanized Asian Fare, however if you have any knowledge of Thai food - don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Went here Friday with my mom. We were seated quickly, ordered drinks, and ordered the vegetable pot stickers appetizer. They were ok. I'm biased because I'm not a fan of pot stickers. Just not my thing I guess.

I also ordered the Philly roll and received it quickly. The smoked salmon on it was very good and the roll overall was flavorful and tasted fresh. 

Next, I ordered a tofu curry dish with potatoes, carrots, and onions. I wasn't expecting the chunks of food in the curry to be so large! I think it would be better if they were bite sized. The curry sauce though, oh my gosh, it was delicious!! It was a yellow curry and coconut sauce and had some serious depth of flavor. The tofu pieces were very large and not seared so they didn't have much flavor. I'll probably go with shrimp next time. The veggies were as expected. All of this came with some white rice which was perfectly cooked and sticky. YUM! Who doesn't love sticky rice??

I was only able to eat about half of my entree so I took the rest home to enjoy for lunch the next day. The flavors were even better after melding together overnight in the fridge. 

Overall, good food. Next time I go I'd like to try the traditional pad thai. I took one star off because my mom asked the waitress for a to-go order when we were ordering our food and the waitress forgot about it so we had to wait after our meal for the order to be cooked. Also, the fountain in the front entrance has a nasty odor. Are there fish in there? I think the water needs changed."}
{"text":"I've updated my review from 1 star to 3 stars. Because I'm desperate for Thai food we've been ordering out here about once a month. Lately we've been very happy with their pad thai, red curry and pad see ewe."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.

Edamame had zero salt.  Complained, and they brought me a bowl of table salt.  Literally.  Complained again and they brought it to the kitchen to salt, and brought it out cold.

Ordered my main dish without green peppers.  They brought it filled with Green Peppers.

I complained to the manager, who could have cared less, and didn't even take the Edamame off my bill.

Why pay Hudson prices for poor food and service.  Avoid this place!!"}
{"text":"The food is always great and I love the atmosphere.  You can choose from Thai, Chinese, or Sushi dishes.  It's all good!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on New Year's day.  The hot and sour soup was awesome but the orange chicken didn't have much orange flavor and the breading on the chicken was mushy, not crisp.  I'm giving them five stars because the service we received from our waiter was the best restaurant service I've had in a very long time.  He was extremely knowledgeable and accommodating throughout the meal.  I will go back just for the soup and have a dish without breaded chicken."}
{"text":"Tasty chicken dishes and sushi.  I got the dragon roll without the eel.  It came with a great mildly spicy orange/red sauce as well as soy.  The egg rolls are great, but the wonton soup wasn't worth it. The meat was chewy/rubbery.  Yuck.  Chicken and beef satay was interesting.  It tasted like it was seasoned with the chicken ramen noodle flavoring...?  The tiramisu cheesecake was yummy, but not very cheesecake-like at all.  Definitely worth a visit for sushi or chicken dish."}
{"text":"Awful food. I am sushi connoisseur and realized right off the bat that their sushi is barely even sushi grade sushi. No vibrant colors in their sushi, it's like it's weeks old. I tried ordering sesame chicken (nobody should mess up sesame chicken as a Pad Thai restaurant) .. Overly breaded, unknown stringy meat that may have been deer roadkill just like that restaurant in North Carolina. I've given Pad Thai 4 chances , which I normally don't do, they FAILED every single time at serving me a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Good flavor, but not nearly hot enough.  When I order \"Thai Hot\" I shouldn't have to add ANY heat at the table.  I should get a good sweat on just from what's brought out from the kitchen.  There could be more sauce on the main dish (I had Massaman Curry) so I've got something to soak up with the rice, but overall it was a decent meal.  Great service.  I've had Sushi here in the past and it was also fresh and well done."}
{"text":"Went with a friend who swears by this place for lunch.  We went for dinner.

I had a spicy ahi tuna roll and their signature dish, pad thai.  The tuna roll was decent; good flavor combination, tasted fresh, good burn on the spiciness.

Unfortunately, the pad thai was less than stellar.  Probably the worst I've ever eaten, and I always order pad thai the first time I visit a new place that offers it.  The chicken had no seasoning on it at all; it was flavorless and didn't even absorb any of the sauce or other flavors in the rest of the dish.  By the time I had eaten half of it, I wasn't tasting anything at all.  Definitely not worth $13 and certainly not worth naming the restaurant after it.

I may go back for lunch...if I do so I'll try to find out what the cooks actually know how to make and order that instead.

The decor and the atmosphere screamed \"trying too hard,\" maybe in an effort to justify prices that were probably a couple of bucks too high for the quality of food delivered."}
{"text":"this Thai place is awesome, and very vegan friendly. their tofu is insanely delicious - honestly among the best I've ever had. they do some weird thing that gives it a spectacular internal texture. the decor is beautiful and totally out of this world. it's pretty pricy, but 100% worth it. such a wonderful date spot. and the (small) bar is so gorgeous too! and they have tasty lychee martinis!"}
{"text":"5657 Darrow Road 
Hudson, OH 44236-4013 
330-650-9998
As close to authentic Thai food as you'll get in the Stow/Hudson area. They have a sister restaurant called Thai Gourmet just down the road that's almost as good for better pricing.
Pad Thai has all the classic Thai dishes as well as Chinese food so it's good for a group of people where some might not be a fan of one or the other type of cuisine. The service is generally nice and the atmosphere is relaxing with plenty of room between you and the next table.
The food was cooked to perfection and spiced just as asked whether it's take-out or dine-in. The price is on the higher side and this would be the kind of place to take a first date, have an anniversary or birthday dinner, etc."}
{"text":"I will have to agree with the comment about the best sushi! I live in Cali and travel all over the states but nothing compares to the sushi here.  The red and green curry dishes are delicious too!  The service is wonderful! It's usually my first stop when visiting Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for several years, and they recently renovated the interior & it looks a lot better. My husband loves the pad thai and I love the sushi and the lunch box special. It's a perfect place to go if you want to see a late movie because of their hours and it's really close to the Hudson movie theater. I also think they have the best Thai iced tea in the Akron area."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite of my wife and I for years since it first opened, primarily since we love Thai food and it was so close to our house. But it has continued to go downhill to the point where we'd rather drive a little further to go somewhere else.

The big negative for us has been the service. It is a busy place, so we have made reservations the past several times and are never seated on time. We typically end up waiting 15 - 30 minutes after our reserved time to get seated despite showing up on time, which is unacceptable. On our last visit, they were 20 minutes late in seating us, and did not have menus for us when they finally did seat us. We sat there for 15 minutes and no one came around before my wife went back to the hostess to get us some menus. Our server did not show up for another 10 minutes after that. 

As far as the food, it's usually good but nothing exceptional. I've had much better Thai food at other places a little closer to Cleveland, that are also less expensive. Pad Thai is not cheap, and with our experiences with bad service only getting worse over time, this is not on our list to revisit anytime soon despite being 10 minutes away."}
{"text":"This place is simply not good! Someone recommended Pad Thai for lunch but we were very disappointed. First, behind the front desk there is a random pile of junk stacked in the corner. It's junk, basically trash!!!!  Food wise, I am disappointed as well. We had a chicken and a beef entree. The meat was tasteless and so tough! Gross! Is it too much to ask to cook your meat??? Overall the meal was on the colder side too. I thought that it would be sizzling hot, but no the food was barely warm. I will not go back to this restaurant! You can't even compare this place to Ty Fun in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I will say the food is good. The service is absolutely terrible. We usually get our food to go. We don't order a lot, sushi or Pad Thai and soup and salad. They always forget something like the salad dressing or soy sauce. Today when I ordered they told me it would be fifteen minutes for two sushi rolls and soup. It took 30 minutes and they didn't even apologize for it taking so long. I asked for the manger and he was really rude and refused to apologize or do anything to make it right. He just kept making excuses they weren't even busy. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"I can't even tell you about the food. My family arrived at 6:05pm on Friday night. The restaurant was maybe half full. We were seated immediately but after 10 minutes, we had not seen a server at our table. After 5 more minutes, we decided we had enough and left. On the way out I told a server we were leaving and she just shrugged her shoulders. We will NEVER go to this place again."}
{"text":"Overall: I don't recommend for take-out since prices are based on a sit-down dinner.  Food is average.

Food: 3 stars.  Red chicken curry had a very good sauce.  Tom Yum chicken soup was very mild with bland flavor.  Pad See Ew was decent.  Egg rolls were average at best.

Prices: 1 star.  $13.95 for red chicken curry is very high, plus they charged me $2 additional for extra broccoli.  $12.95 pad see ew is also high.  $4.00 Tom Yum chicken is a good price.  $3.00 per egg roll is way too high.

Service: 2 stars.  I got carryout only.  They didn't mention the extra charge for broccoli, which is annoying.

Appearance: 4 stars.  The interior is decorated very well."}
{"text":"First time here.

I had the Siracha Pork, a spicy dish with a brown chili sauce, and my wife had the Chirachi, which is kind of like a sashimi sampler in a bowl.  We split a seaweed salad, I had a Thai beer and she had some fruity drink.  About $52 before the tip.

Everything was very good.  We were seated quickly, the server was attentive, and all the food was very good.  It does feel a little hectic, with servers busily rushing around, but that was fine.

I would certainly be back.  They have a huge menu and there are lot of other things I want to try."}
{"text":"3/30/18 Had the pineapple shrimp fried rice. Very tasty and plenty of it. Crab Rangoon is very good, especially in their sauce. Wife said the wonton soup was also good. Gave a fourth star this for this visit...typically had a 3 star experience in the past."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and tried many of the curries, as well as the coconut milk vegetable soup. I love the decor and giant jade Buddhas in this space. However, the service is really hit or miss (can be really abrupt or have to ask for things like water multiple times). Additionally, some of the food can be extremely spicy to the point of overpowering all other flavors, so pick carefully, especially if you are sensitive to spice and lots of black pepper! Portions are great (you'll probably have leftovers), there's plenty of parking, and tons of vegan/vegetarian options.

I really enjoy the mango curry, yellow and green curries, and the coconut milk vegetable soup (option to add tofu for a charge) Brown rice is available for a surcharge."}
{"text":"I adore their rolled tofu. Rice is always fresh. A bit pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Love love love Pad Thai! This is a favorite restaurant for my whole family!  The best way we have found to order is family style.  Order a bunch of dishes and share them with everyone, this way you get to eat all the great dishes instead of being stuck with just one! On our last visit everything we ate was amazinggg! Here's what we had, Pad Thai, Siam Curry, Hunan Beef, and Spicy Garlic Shrimp.  I would recommend every single thing!  Definitely give this place a try for a special occasion or just a delicious dinner out!"}
{"text":"good food + decent prices + friendly staff = would come here again

Came here with a very large group including kids and everyone left full.  The portions were large and there were lots of vegetarian options on the menu which was great.  The vegetarian Pad Thai wasn't the most flavorful dish but it did have lots of veggies and tofu which was appreciated.  Overall I think this place is great and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Get the Khing curry.  It seems to be unique to this place and its awesome.  I know the secret ingredient but I'm not telling!  Get the _Crispy Fried Green Beans_ for an appetizer...I cannot emphasize that enough.  This place is consistently good.  Their sushi is great too!"}
{"text":"absolutely horrid. the atmosphere is nice but if you're looking for good Thai food, this definitely isn't the place. basil chicken hardly had any chicken in it and the general tsos chicken was raw in some spots. never going again."}
{"text":"Not really authentic Thai. There are more Chinese dishes then Thai. 

Stick with the pad Thai or the lad na. And for appetizers-chicken satay or the calamari."}
{"text":"It looks like a nice restaurant. good decor and atmosphere. place looks clean neat. BUT the food was so bad. I'm not a picky eater at all and I love Thai food. Ive been to most of the Thai restaurant in the area. but this one is like the worst that ive ever had. we ordered a seafood soup was okay. with good amount of seafood and a cool container with flames. and I ordered a coconut noodle dish. Im a big fan of coconut. the i had three bites of that noodle it was so plain and the noodle was soggy absorbed all the sauce.  so i just stopped eating. no one asked about it for like 15 mins. and finally a lady asked my how was the food i said i didn't care for it. so they kindly offered me they will make a new one for me. so in order to be safe I ordered pad thai which all thai restaurant has it. it was still really bad but i didn't tell them. it feels like a fake pad thai. it has all the ingredient in it and I feel like an part time cook made it. and it has a lot of sauce. like food from food court in a mall. it doesn't worth 13 dollars at all. and the restaurant name is Pad Thai ! I don't understand why a good looking restaurant with decent service have such bad food.. i didn't try the sushi but they looked good. since they give me a new dish free of charge thats why I give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered take out just before Christmas.  The dish tasted odd so we didn't finish it.  We developed food poisoning within 24 hours.  It was so bad we actually called the health dept.! Destroyed our holiday! Luckily the kids didn't have anything to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food!!! You must try the crab ragoons, thai iced tea, seafood soup(best soup you'll ever have) and the spicy basil with beef! The sushi is excellent also! If you haven't tried thai food you must go here. You will fall in love. Amazing quality and great service. Super cute atmosphere!"}
{"text":"one of the best restaurants in the area and definitely the best asian fare. don't miss out all of their dishes are out of this world and this coming from a professional chef. the owner is also amazing his work ethic and recipes make this a must. and it's called pad thai for a reason the best i've ever had !!!"}
{"text":"I went in on a late Saturday afternoon and was greeted warmly by the friendly staff here. You almost instantly get a Thai-like feeling as soon as you park and that is further bolstered by the inside ambience.

On the recommendation of my stewardess, I ordered a green curry with tofu and was (again) instantly delighted when I looked at my dish. It tasted every bit the way it looked. I went in for one spice level lower than the highest and was given their 'hot hot' sauce on the side which I did not turn up using. 

The curry had the right spice level and the vegetables were both cooked well and had the right flavours. Highly recommended if you want to soak in the serenity while enjoying a tasty curry!"}
{"text":"Some of the best chinese food around and for a fairly decent price too!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service.  The food was incredible!!!  The seafood Tom Yum soup for two was maybe the most delicious and exciting share dish I've ever experienced.  The Thai dumplings were out of this world and the sushi was perfect!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Decent ambience and food in the middle of Ohio. Service could improve though..."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorites! We love the curries they serve and the calamari is one of the best we have had. Sushi is also delish. Great food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant was pretty good and I enjoyed the Thai iced tea a lot. The pad Thai was good too, although it was slightly dry. The spring rolls were alright but could have had more flavor, as they had too much lettuce and lightly seasoned chicken. It seems as if this restaurant was trying too hard to conform to American tastes, and didn't stick to the traditional Thai recipes as much as the more highly rated Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here after a movie, so it was kinda late. Still no excuse for trash from the night's dinner service all over the floors, dust and food drippings on the molding, and a sticky table. Having moved here from an urban area of Cincinnati, where there is a great Thai restaurant on almost every corner, I try to give suburban thai restaurants a little bit of latitude. We had picked up take out from here before and thot it was pretty decent, except for the steamed pork potstickers, which were disappointing. I thot maybe having them at the restaurant might be better. Wrong. The pork still tasted like dog food. The spring rolls were pretty tasty and my husbands beef lo mein was good (although how can you really screw that up? It's a safe order). I ordered a thai noodle dish. I probably ate 3 bites. I would normally give this restaurant one more try, but I was so disgusted by how dirty it was that I will never go back. I think I've watched restaurant impossible a few too many times. Robert irvine would have a field day at this establishment."}
{"text":"Overall great restaurant.  We  had a Mai Tai and Mango martini for beverages both were mixed just right.  There was a large selection of many different Asian cuisines which was a bonus we didn't expect walking in.  Our waitress was very helpful towards our questions everything was brought out in a reasonable speed.  We ordered chicken lettuce wraps for an appetizer and Pad Tai and Pad See Ew for entrees.  All of which were delicious.  The outside an entrance of the restaurant is getting remodeled and will likely be finished in the next week or so."}
