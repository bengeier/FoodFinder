{"text":"Well, we *really* wanted to enjoy this place, and it wasn't until a few days after we ate there did we come clean with each other and admit that it was \"mehhh\" - at best.    The atmosphere is kitschy, it's small and intimate, the owner and the server are extremely friendly, it's just that the food isn't very good."}
{"text":"Best food on Queen. The staff is very friendly and the food is incredible! I can't believe that so many people are complaining about the carrots in the burrito. Not only are carrots healthy but they in no way overpower the burrito. It is delectable and as good as it gets!!"}
{"text":"Friendly people, a little dusty inside ( look at the art pieces on the wall ) I don't know if they label the containers with dates of expiration though ( because I heard one of the guys say ) IS THIS STILL OKAY ? and if you have to ask and not know, that is a red flag in my opinion... Rice seems to be instant ( and if not ) still not all that great. Burrito is below par in taste, freshness and way to much sour cream topped on top of it. WAY TO MUCH !  I see the microwave, but I don't see the stove, doesn't have the smell of fresh cooked beef or chicken until the microwave goes on then you can smell what you will be eating. Not the best place to go to in my opinion"}
{"text":"This is the spot for burritos! I've had many (but not nearly all) of the city's burrito offerings, and Coyote Willie is the one that I keep coming back to. They're not Mission style burritos, CW has their own take and it's a winner. After 10 years of eating the chicken burrito, and only the chicken burrito,  I decided to give their Tacquitos a try and they too were fantastic. A sampler of the baked beans also proved to be extremely tasty. I find it odd that people are off-put by the friendly staff... seriously?"}
{"text":"Great chicken burrito! Not much to the place, I'd recommend take out. Yum!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here last Thursday evening. Living close by and a huge burrito fan, I walked along to Coyote Willie's wondering why I don't go more often. I had visited once before, eight months ago, and vaguely recall a satisfying, but not outstanding experience, so was interested to try again - especially seeing how I didn't order any actual Mexican food last time (I believe it was just a regular sandwich.)   My conclusions ended up being about the same this time around.   The service was very friendly and helpful, and preparation time was standard for a burrito take-out place. I ordered a vegetarian burrito (as I generally do in all Mexican joints), and was pleased to see that the price was about average,perhaps slightly lower, than what you'd usually pay for the same product elsewhere.   Unfortunately, the taste was quite disappointing. I wasn't a fan of the shredded carrots, and there was a distinct lack of the regular vegetables that you'd generally find in a vegetarian burrito - e.g: onions, peppers, refried beans. Don't get me wrong - they were definitely there, but the abundance of shredded carrots overpowered them. In fact, the carrots even overpowered the salsa!   What really dominated this burrito, however, was the tortilla itself. I'm not sure if it just wasn't cooked as long as it should have been, or if the tortillas used here are simply extra doughy, but if there was one element dominating even those cursed shredded carrots, it was the tortilla. The taste of flour and dough hit me from the first second of my first bite.   Despite the above, I probably will try Coyote Willie's again. Its friendliness and expansive menu options (for such a tiny place) are enough to ensure that the business deserves to do well. Also, it's not their fault their ingredients in the veggie burrito deviated slightly from the standard. The veggies within were obviously fresh, and cooked well. I just didn't like the particular combination.   I will visit again, try something else, and update accordingly!"}
{"text":"Coyote Willie's is one of those places that has promise but for the most part is just mediocre at best.   I tried the beef burrito grande as well as the rib dinner with coyote fries. The burrito was pretty big, and for the most part was basically all ground beef (aside from the shredded carrot of course, which wasn't bad to be honest.) It was good, just kind of bland I guess. It's pretty cheap and I would probably go back for this if I was in the area and looking for something inexpensive and filling. The ribs had promise but they looked and tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. The coyote fries (they are just fries actually) were decent and delicious when dipped in rib grease.  The staff is indeed very friendly, especially coyote willie (i can only assume the man who served me was coyote willie himself.)"}
{"text":"It's a small diner with a few tables, or take out.  I walked in for the first time and asked the gent behind the counter to recommend something.  I ended up with an amazing burrito, and have been back to try some of the other dishes.  Well-prepared, generous portions, friendly and helpful staff (I think they're the owners), and they've been serving Mexican fare since long before the Burrito Boys/Brothers/Bandits/etc existed (if I recall, I believe the guy said they'd been open for 30 years).    Simple, well-prepared food, with good variety and friendly service.  What more could you ask for in a take out spot?"}
{"text":"I love the veggie chili but wow it is hot hot hot the two guys are nice but this place is not open weekends"}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars to encourage a bit of a raise in the rating, but I think what the other comments have stated stand accurate. This place does look outdated but you know what, I haven't seen a place look like this since the early 2000s and it's kind-of good to see this today instead of a place trying to be hip, but it definitely needs a bit of dusting and arrangement.  The staff is definitely nice and well-intentioned, and it's been the same 2 folks working and owning the place since it opened. I have had their grande burrito and it's good because it's satisfying and plentiful. People disagree that it may not be their favorite burrito, and I'm no burrito amateur or anything, I just think for ground beef wrapped in a tortilla with sour cream on top, it's a filling meal. Others don't seem to be OK with the shredded carrot, but I say why not? I like it, but like I said I'm a noob when it comes to burritos and tex-mex. The food is exactly what you get by reading the menu because it is prepared right there and so it doesn't need bells and whistles around it to embellish it on the plate. You are getting home-style food here.  As far as tex-mex goes, this may not be the real deal or authentic, but the items are reasonably priced and clean and satisfying, and it's good to know that when you go in there you can get this standard pretty much every time.  I'll tell you what, though, dear reader, previous reviews do not mention their underrated sole sandwich... which is a favorite of mine, here. It is reasonably priced and is definitely satisfying when you want some fish on some nice proper bread for it. I love the fish sandwich and I think everyone should try it at least once in there. Here's a little challenge then for those who had already reviewed this place; try the sole sandwich, and see what you think. Would you rather eat the sole here, or the beef? I say sole."}
{"text":"While it's laid out like your average diner, it's easy to feel like you've walked into a living room and are being served delicious burritos and \"coyote fries\" by the kindly owner and his friendly sidekick.  The tables are very close together, sometimes making things a little too intimate with other diners, but random conversations are part of the charm of your meal."}
{"text":"In a time capsule from (my) 1990's Coyote makes some basic \"diner-style\" Mexican food. It's all home made but none of it is done super fresh (it seems assembled from long-prepared ingredients and heated up) and this dry-chicken scenario won't impress Mex aficionados. It's kind of hack in a sweet way. But I still like this diner-esque weird little place, and the food quality is never actually bad. It feeds the soul. Burritos and Enchaladas are good - almost verging on bland yet admittedly some taste there, I went here quite a bit for a time but the retrogressiveness and utter frozen-in-time predictability of the place was getting to me. Still I want to go this week now I think of it!"}
{"text":"In an effort to find the best burrito in Toronto I decided to try this little place that has literally been around for decades yet, least spoke about in Burrito circles. As soon as I opened the door it felt like I went back in time. Very old style and dated and so are the staff, but it was all good. Nice people for sure.  While I went in for a burrito the friendly coyote recommended I try the nachos as he claimed they are the best in the world.  So I did and they weren't. But they were certainly generous is portion size and not bad.    So far the best Nachos in the world can be found at i caramba! on Elgin Street, in the Soho district of Hong Kong. It has become a favorite of mine and Eddies.  It would be interesting to know if anyone else has tried i caramba! in Hong Kong  Back to Coyote Willies: Someone next to me ordered the Burrito and it looked good so I will just have to make another trip back."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken burrito dinner with rice and salad. Highly recommend. However, you must be aware that Willie's makes their burritos differently than other burrito joints (Burrito boys, etc.). And I think this is where some disappointment comes from. Nonetheless, I actually prefer their way of making burritos compared to other places because they aren't as dry.  Good prices and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Staff are a little too friendly, almost pushy with friendliness. They've been around 20 years and it seems like they haven't changed since they opened. Diner's tastes in Mexican have changed though, and people prefer more fresh ingredients and choices then are available. I have to agree about the weirdness of shredded carrots in a burrito. I won't likely be back and I hope a new Mexican place opens nearby and soon!"}
{"text":"I had the Burrito grande. I haven't eaten much \"real\" Mexican food before, but this was probably the best burrito I've ever had. The place is tiny and has mayb 4 tables. The only downside is that it had wayyyyy too many beans and it gave me gas all afternoon.  I will definitely go back one day for lunch as it is just down the street from my office. I'll update the review at that time."}
{"text":"The food here was O-K.    The price was good, and the staff was very friendly, but the food was definitely nothing special.  I had the chorizo baked beans and a side of fries and my friend had the burrito with the mexican rice.  She liked the rice but wasn't blown away by the burrito, and it had shredded carrots in it which we both thought was weird.  It was very affordable - our meals with pops were only 19$ total."}
