{"text":"After reading these reviews, i was almost frightened to try Go Go china. I found the courage and called anyway. Talked to a friendly guy, placed my order for pick-up and was told the price and wait time. Drove over there to pick it up, they were just as friendly as on the phone. Food tasted like normal. Not terrible, not fantastic.  Just normal \"Americanized Chinese\"  food. Now the only thing id have a complaint about  is that there was no plastic-ware in the bag, so lucky i was going home and not, say, back to work ."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.  I ordered Chicken Chow Mein.  After waiting 40 minutes, it was delivered...with no noodles.  So I called and told them that they brought me the wrong thing.  They said they would run another one over.    They brought the same thing again.  Apparently, according to them, chow mein does not have any noodles besides a crispy noodle.  I lived in San Francisco for 10 years, went to numerous Chinese food restaurants, and every time I ordered chow mein, it had noodles.  It was gross.  I will never order from there again."}
{"text":"Disgusting Chinese food. After the dirty diner let out that they had several major violations I knew I would never be back..."}
{"text":"Will never order again.  Supposedly we got chicken chow mein, but I can't confirm it was actually chicken.  We also got beef with broccoli.  Broccoli seemed safe, but not sure what they grey meat was that came with it.  Never will order again."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place for the first and last time tonight. The ordering process went well and I was quoted the average chinese restaurant delivery time (1 hour to an hour 15). After an hour and 40 minutes, my LUKEWARM order arrived. The lemon chicken that my boyfriend got tastes oddly like dryer sheets (it sounds sarcastic, but it's not) and my \"mongolian beef\" tastes like phoenix tap-water. It's got this dirty metallic taste. Very odd..... Oh, and our cream-cheese wontons are cold and rubbery.  All this \"great food\" for only $31? Yippee! I will never order from this place again and I suggest you don't either."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and waited 90 min only to receive the least appetizing Chinese food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Go Go china has been our go-to for Chinese delivery for the last 3 years. It's absolutely delicious, and always delivered quickly. We love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always good .. I always get the same thing... it's hard to find authentic Chinese food and this place does taste good!"}
{"text":"Food is reasonably priced and good must have cleaned up their act. Not dirty now perhaps they have new owners."}
{"text":"I didn't want to go anywhere, so I ordered from here. The choices (beyond pizza) are scarce in this area.   The person taking my order over the phone was friendly, and got the order right. I had to ask for a quote of the price. A receipt was never included in the delivery. He quoted 45 minutes,   It took 45 minutes. I paid with cash - and the delivery person was obviously scared to hold cash, he went back to his car for change. I guess? since we never ordered before from this phone number/address - but damn.   The thing I want to point out is the meat portions were tiny. I got three shrimp my meal. The other meat portion was tiny as well.  The only positive is we got a lot of crab puffs for the price.  Try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just ordered food from here, and yeah no thanks. It doesn't even taste good when you're drunk. The wonton soup was pretty much store bought chicken broth with giant empty wontons. And the pork fried rice had maybe 10 tiny little pieces of pork in it. Yuck yuck yuck."}
{"text":"I never expect much out of Chinese delivery. We have been ordering from Go Go for 4 years and the food has gone from just 2 stars to 4 stars over the last year. Rapid fast delivery and always hot and fresh. The meats and veggies have doubled in size and the last 4 or 5 meals from there have been superb. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"This place sucked! I never been more disappointed. And it's supposedly \"NEW YORK\" style?! Yeah right! The only thing they had that was \"New York style\" was the boneless spare ribs. Only good thing was the egg roll! The soda was so flat. The driver wasn't even organized, he was on the phone. My order was 26 and I gave him 40 and he walked off with it untill I asked for my change. In which he only had 4 dollars on him and ask if that was ok! Ugh, the worst place ever. The fried \"crab\" meat was like eating a sponge! The cream cheese wontons where soar. If u ever want something CLOSE to \"New York style\" Chinese food go to \"red dragon\" think it was called. (Google it), not sure where it is exactly but it has been by far the best in Arizona. I only ate there twice bc i don't live that close and I don't have my own transportation but if I did the drive would def  be worth it! But there is NOTHING as good as the REAL NEW YORK Chinese food. Go to NEW YORK if u want to experience good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Horrible food place was dirty and we found something in our vegetable low Keon that was neither vegetable or noodle. Looked like an insect and had a hard crispy outer shell. Made me and my wife want to vomit"}
{"text":"Wish you could give ZERO stars. Ordered online for delivery. Over an hour later with still no food I called. The guy said they tried calling me three times to say something was wrong with my card but no one had called me! Total lie. The online order went through and there's nothing wrong with card!  Ok. Changed to 2 stars.  Delivery guy just showed up with food an hour and a half after i ordered. He played like he didn't know what I was talking about. I think they hurried, made food and delivered. My kids were ecstatic so we're happy now.  But the chow mein and moo goo gai pan were the exact same things."}
{"text":"I quit going to Go GO China for a long time as the taste and quality of the food had really gone down hill.  I decided to try Go Go China again recently and to my surprise the pork fried rice had dramatically improved.  I've gone back several times lately and the food has been consistently very good.  I don't know what happened but I'm glad the restaurant seems to be back on track again."}
{"text":"I ate this food for 10 years until they decided to not deliver my food and not answer the telephone. Do not order from this place. I REPEAT, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Burnt, salty and just.. no.  Never again. Hungry teenagers even said they couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Service is great! Delivery is always amazingly fast, even faster than jimmy Johns... LOL! Food is tasty and always hot!"}
{"text":"I hate to write this but I should have looked at the reviews before ordering. I would not have ordered if I'd read them.  This is possibly the worst or second to worst Chinese food I've ever tasted. I'm usually not picky about food, and I think many people are too picky and critical, but I had to throw out what I didn't eat. I don't know what recipes they are using, but it all just tasted very, very weird and.... off somehow. One of the dishes had a very greasy and oily after taste. It didn't smell all that good either.  I should have stuck with my main go-to: Wok Express across the street."}
{"text":"We went with my daughter and her husband's choice for delivery Chinese food while we were at their place on the NE side of town on Christmas afternoon. This is their go-to place for takeout & delivery...Go Go China. We had 4 main dishes: sweet & sour pork, beef & broccoli, cashew chicken, bbq pork ribs, w/ pork fried rice w/ spring rolls & white rice. Delivered in 30 minutes & almost burned my mouth HOT. What a feast! It was so flavorful w/ good sized portions, in plastic containers (except for the fried rice which was over stuffed into your typical Chinese take out box). More than enough for one meal for 4. Plenty left over for a nice lunch. They don't provide plates, napkins, or utensils-the reason for only 4 stars. But they do provide plenty of sweet & sour sauce & pkgs of soy sauce. Thx Go Go China for the great Christmas meal and FA, RA, RA, RA, RA, RA, RA, RA, RA"}
{"text":"In theater and comfort weeks ago I missed a phone order and Ronald scram fives and send the resume for a minute and was my friend at Nephi sick on Montana take her to the hospital but they fixed it and then he was a free entrée I don't next order and that wins tonight I am always like GoGoChina and him current Chinese food I'd recommend him for any money very friendly and polite people really professional I'm going recommended for take out or delivery and we wimps and frienThere's a memory drivers always been very polite and friendly thank you GoGoChina for all your wonderful phone Mr. George Daniel Smith"}
{"text":"*sigh* I always forget to check Yelp reviews before ordering from Grubhub. Usually that comes back to bite me in the butt.  The delivery was fairly fast, it got here in about 35 minutes (fast compared to the estimated delivery time of 1 hour, that is). But I'm immediately taking off 1 star because they forgot my soda. It would be one thing if I was at home, but I'm at work so I'm stuck drinking nasty tapwater with my mediocre Chinese food. Not what I would call a good night (plus, not getting what you paid for is never a good thing, even if it was just a soda).  The food was definitely warm enough. I ate my cream cheese puffs right away, but the steamed dumplings and lo mein sat around for about 20 minutes before I could get to them and they were still warm.  As for the actual food... well, it's ok. The dumplings are different than I'm used to, they are more doughy than I've had before. Not a bad thing, just something that surprised me since Chinese delivery is usually so uniform. They almost looked homemade. I was wondering why they were almost as much as my entrée- its because there are 9 of them!   The cream cheese puffs were pretty good, but also more doughy than I'm used to. Maybe undercooked? But still good, I would order them again.  I can't leave a review on the lo mein because the cream cheese puffs and dumplings filled me up and I haven't eaten it yet! I opened the container and it smelled good. Looked a little bit light on meat (I ordered beef) but I can't be sure.  OVERALL, here's my final opinion. If, like me, you are ordering delivery and have limited options, go for it. It's not going to be the best Chinese you've ever had, but it's far from the worst I've ever had (see my review for Lucky Kitchen!). If you have the option of driving, then I would suggest driving PAST this place to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken explains the restaurant. Not sure what meat that is but it is suppose to be chicken"}
{"text":"Fried rice & beef dish was too salty and tasteless, but shrimp chou mein was the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Pretty bad when you order your food,  it  never shows up and they wont answer your calls.   We drive down and they say they never even started our order.   Stay away,  Chinese food is not rocket science,  this establishment is awful.  Let's call it \"No No China\"  as you won't ever get your food."}
{"text":"Sweet and sour chicken was awesome.  Vegetable fried rice was huge and was packed full of great vegetables."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and after an hour and a half without my food I drove down and was told they had not even started my order. NEVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"We ordered a lot of dishes to feed our large family. I kid you not, every single dish looked and TASTED the exact same. We could not tell the difference between any of them. So disappointing."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery on a Saturday for lunch. Portions were good, the taste was Beyer than most. Ordered the ribs, they were yummy. I have tried all of the Chinese in the neighborhood and this we will be our new go to chinese."}
{"text":"Before they sold GoGo China to another owner a few years ago, I would order from here once a week... Yui Shan pork, Szechuan Chicken, and Crab Puffs.  Perfectly delicious...  And then that one fateful day, I received my order and nothing was the same... the pork and chicken dinners looked EXACTLY alike and were the worst tasting dishes I could remember eating.   Never again..."}
{"text":"Now under new management with more menu items!!   This has been my go-to place for the last 7 years. I have never had any issues. It has recently been taken over by new management which has resulted in even better food and more varieties to choose from on the menu. I was extremely happy with the egg roles, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef and the Chicken Low Mein (everything my wife and I ordered). We called in the order so we just went for the basic stuff but, after looking at the menu that was given to us after our take-out, I noticed quite a number of new dishes added to the menu that I'm looking forward to trying next. If you were disappointed in the past, please give this place another try."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time 10 - 15 years ago.  It was mediocre to okay.  Nothing to write home about but not terrible.  Thought I would give it another chance last night.  BIG MISTAKE.  Chicken fried rice had almost no chicken in it.  Hunan beef medium spicy was bland.  Beef Egg Foo Yung was unidentifiable in the container.  Only once I stabbed into it did I discover the egg patty which was disgusting at best.  Fried dumplings were way too doughy and the sauce was way too bland.  Appetizer order of BBQ spare ribs were 4 pieces cut through the bones - not even full bones + meat.  And the \"free\" sesame chicken\" that came with an order over $35 came smothered in sweet and sour sauce for some unknown reason.   I know I still remember good Chinese food from my San Francisco days but I have adjusted my expectations the past 20 years in Phoenix.  This was just over the top awful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have given Go Go China several times to succeed and they have failed everytime.The people who take the order over the telephone are rude and never give you time to feel like they want you as a customer. They will make you feel like an idiot and rushed. At the end of my order they didn't repeat the order to me, who knows what I am going to get but also I have no idea how much I am going to pay.Also, last time we ordered from there, they gave us no sweet and sour sauce. When we called and nicely asked if they could please bring us some sauce they accused us of lying and that we had gotten sauce but wanted more.I avoid confrontation at all costs but am sick of this place. There food is ok, but not worth the rudeness from the workers. I quit!"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up tonight and very disappointed. Soup had some weird brown gelatin like chunks in it and large order had 3 small shrimp in it. General tso chicken greasy and full of grissle. Haven't been here in a long time and mom wanted to try it again tonight and we won't be back"}
{"text":"go go is a no no, dinner had no taste, fried rice was undercooked and dumplings were bland and tasteless, this was a first and a last time for us"}
{"text":"Delivery took 2 hours! I can understand on weekend...but on a Wednesday, wow!  I called to ask where my order was and I was placed on hold.  I could hear the guy talking to the other person the other phone, he was apologizing for their late order too.  As least when the food arrived it was good food.  The pork fried rice was the best part, its nice to see that was a option for the meals."}
{"text":"Scarborough has SO many different plazas that serve fast-food style Chinese food. I was extremely happy to have been brought to another food court with 5-6 different stalls that sell Chinese/Vietnamese food.   It is a bit overwhelming with so many signs and stalls that sell the same thing but my pro tip is to always look at what others are eating. This place has ample seating and the first thing I noticed was how many people were eating chicken rice. It was $5 for a box filled to the brim with rice, chicken, and choy + a choice of soup or soy milk. It isn't the best I've ever had but I was able to split this into 2 meals. Cheap food that doesn't break the bank.  Now, I probably wouldn't order from them again due to the fact that I want to try the other stalls in the food court."}
{"text":"The worst.  I ordered chow fun, wide noodles.  Got home and they were skinny noodles.  Called them and got some bullshit response.  They will NEVER get my business again."}
{"text":"This is the Chinese place with the poor reviews that I decided to try. The General Tso Chicken lunch special was good but there wasn't much chicken and only one piece of broccoli. Lots of rice (filler). The egg roll was tasty.   Even though most Chinese places serve frozen Gen Chicken, the texture of the final product is important. This one was a winner. Crispy and flavorful. Not soggy and not using the sweet and sour bather. Good stuff.   The man working the register was also the cook. He seemed annoyed I was there. Maybe he was having a rough day.   Will I come back? Prob not unless the portion sizes increase."}
{"text":"Orderex for delivery young lady on the phone kind welcoming service stated order would be about an hr which it wasnt the delivery artived about 45 minutes hot n so good ordered 50.00 worth n all was good great food thank you"}
{"text":"Still a reasonably cheap eat, and my other review still stands. I just ordered from here. Didn't get a number or a receipt. How did the lady at the counter let me know my order was ready? \"Wei!\" Which is what someone says when trying to get your attention in a less than polite way. It's the equivalent of someone saying, \"you there!\" in the context she was using it. Rude much."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! Delivery takes FOREVER and food always has one issue or another! The owner is an incompetent fool! He doesn't care about anything once you place your order. .once you eat it, it's your problem he says! Not even an apology or ANYTHING! Do not order from here, ever!"}
{"text":"NO NO NO, this placemakes Panda Express seem gourmet. Garbage food!"}
{"text":"Everyone out there do not order from this place it is horrible disgusting and spoiled food Go Go China is horrible horrible horrible and they will not even give my refund back and didn't even eat my food  they shouldn't even stand in business"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 of the Vegetable Chow Mein, description says that the entree comes with \"wheat noodle\". There were no noodles included. Called the store, let them know about the issue. Owner begins to tell me that they make no mistakes and that it doesn't come with wheat noodles and wasn't willing to do anything about it to correct it. He says the dish comes with veggies and a side of \"crunchy noodles\" and white rice. Again, there was NO noodles, crunchy or soft included! I spent nearly $40 and was not happy with their service and food. After a bit more words, the owner agreed to ONE store credit. Not two, just the one. After asking for two, one for each incorrectly described entree; the owner laughed and said no. I won't be redeeming that credit, as this was a horrible experience and I do not plan on ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this restaurant 3 times for delivery through grub hub and not once have I been disappointed. The food taste great and so is the price. Their delivery service is fast. I live in a gated community off of the 51 and not once have I gotten a call from the driver asking for directions I just get a knock and a friendly \"go go China\". I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a day, where you just didn't want to get out of bed at all?  I mean not even to go to the bathroom?  Well, if you are anything like Mr. Dallas G, you may ask, what could implore you to stay in bed all day?  Well Mr. G, the company of a lovely woman was number one on my list on this particular Saturday.    At about 1:30 in the afternoon, we both started to get ravenous.  I had been having cravings for Chinese food since about 11 PM the previous night.  My lovely bed mate suggested Go Go China.  I had never eaten here before and am a little reluctant to branch out from my usual go to Chinese place.  Once the stunning sack-mate informed me that they deliver and I would not have to leave the bed, I was sold.  She even went downstairs and got the menu! Goddess material, right?  We perused the menu and made our decisions.  I had the task of calling in the order.  A man answered and it was barely discernible what language they were speaking.  After inquiring about placing an order for delivery I was told that they would call back in exactly 6 minutes.  I began to question this, but the other line had already gone dead.  So, we waited the 6 minutes and by golly the phone rang.  I ask to place the order, but am first bombarded with what seems like a CIA inquiry.  After passing the interrogation I am finally allowed to place the order.  Sesame Chicken lunch special for me, which included wonton soup and pork fried rice, and Chicken Lo Mein with chicken fried rice and a pork egg roll.  We also got a shrimp egg roll.  I was worried when they quoted a 45-60 minute wait for delivery.  So, when the food arrived in 20 minutes I was ecstatic.  The beautiful woman next to me went downstairs to retrieve the food and everything.  From atop Mount Olympus she must have come.  The wonton soup was really good, the fried rice was really good,  the Sesame chicken was really good, and the egg roll was really good.  The ravishing Ms. M next to me said all of her food was really good too. Overall, the food was really good.  The best part, aside from being in a bed with a gorgeous woman, eating Chinese food, and not really worrying about anything, the total with delivery and tip was only $21!  To this half-breed Jew, that is the silver lining my friends.     If you find yourself stuck to your mattress and are in need of some sustenance, call Go Go China, wait 6 minutes for a call back and get it delivered.  They truly did."}
{"text":"They changed management and now its just ok Chinese."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Chinese food I've ever had. A waste of money. We had to throw most of it away. Even the egg rolls were bad!"}
{"text":"DO NOT order from here. The food is absolutely disgusting, the place is unsanitary, and the staff is over-the-top rude. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Fast delivery; pretty standard to-go Chinese food; not bad, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"My hubby just went to pick up our order of Mu Shu Pork, shrimp toast, pork egg rolls, and pork fried rice. My husband was concerned at the dirty front of house, but we dug in none the less. The shrimp toast was almost black from dirty oil and fell apart.  It really didn't taste good either.  The egg rolls we just so so.  The Mu Shu was ok too ( greasy) but it was supposed to come with 4 wraps and we only got 3 (not great when you were expecting to split it).  The pork fried rice was greasy and the rice was undercooked.  All in all we were disappointed and after reading other reviews I think we will not be back."}
{"text":"The food at Go Go is really good. However, I can only give my review one star due to the fact that I have found foreign objects in my food on two separate occassions. The first time it was a staple. I let that slide because they staple the lid of the styrofoam food containers for take-out, so I thought maybe I hadn't opened it carefully enough. But not too long after, I almost cracked a tooth when I found a small rock in my rice. The last experience completely ruined it for me and I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Another disgusting tasting Chinese joint in Phoenix.  My order was simple - steamed dumplings and wonton soup.  The meat inside the filling tasted like something very questionable - not pork, not chicken, not beef.  Something dark and oily and ominous.  I could not eat either dish as both tasted as if they were filled with meat from the same mystery animal.  Waste of money.  So I ended up eating a small portion of a visiting relative's chicken and shrimp combo which was almost devoid of meat (might be a good thing, actually) and had absolutely no spice or kick or flavor.   Will not be back."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery today, so good!!! They are a lot faster than most Chinese delivery places too. I ordered orange chicken and vegetable lo mein. Huge portions and so yummy! I don't know why this place only has two stars. My delivery man was super nice too. Will be ordering from here from now on!"}
{"text":"The employees are very nice delivery drivers don't speak much English but very honest very nice I know the owners very nice their new owners food is great it's delivered every day fresh food Steven and Jeremy are doing an awesome job with that bad reputation that the bought into keep up the good job you guys are awesome thank you so much"}
{"text":"It's okay. Nothing I would go out of my way for. Not my favorite at all. The taste is a bit off and questionable. I ordered 2 different times from this place just to give it a chance and both times I was left disappointed. The meal I ordered is supposed to be flavorful and spicy; that wasn't the case. It tasted bland and not spicy at all. I wanted to like this place but the food isn't up to par."}
{"text":"Go Go China - where do I begin?  Food overall is pretty good.  Is it real chinese?  It would be your typical american style chinese.  Is it the best you've ever had?  Not necessarily, but pretty good considering there are very few good chinese take out places in the area (and Phoenix, for that matter).  I totally dig the hot and sour soup.  Other dishes are very flavorful (unlike a lot of bland chinese I've had in the valley) and I feel they go the extra mile where other places cut corners any way they can.  People there are friendly, and I always make it a point to say hi to who I believe is the owner and his wife that cook in the back.  I've seen people comment before on their health department reviews, which like any restaurant has had their share of infractions.  And don't believe just because the health dept. hasn't found them doesn't mean they exist if you think your favorite restaurant is squeaky clean.  I'm the kind of person that doesn't obsess about sanitation especially when facing a great meal of street tacos, take out chinese, or whatever.   You do not want to dine inside.  This place is strictly take-out.  Sure, you could eat there if you want, but it is COMPLETELY devoid of any atmosphere.  The tables are really just for people waiting to get their food to go.  They also deliver, and have an extensive menu.  There are some good appetizers mixed with cantonese, mandarin, szechwan, and hunan-style dishes.  Prices are very affordable too, and they have coupons frequently."}
{"text":"I will not be ordering from here again. The only good thing I ordered was the cream cheese wontons. All of the vegetables had a really funky taste, and the garlic chicken had no garlic flavor."}
{"text":"The portions were huge, the food was okay, pricing was about average. Torn on giving it another shot but probably will.   I asked for extra extra spicy Mongolian Beef, it didn't even have a hint of spice to it.  The Orange Chicken was good, just need it to be a bit more saucy."}
{"text":"You know there are days when I have only $4 in my pocket and I am hungry....  What can I get for $4 that let me have a complete and balance meal? Carbs, fibres and Protein all in one?  Go Go China has $3.99 tax in special... with over 20 different items to choose from! What do I get for my $4???  Chicken with Rice and Veggie and a choice of daily soup or soy bean drink ($3.99)  - Chicken is tasty with mostly dark meat! A lot of flavours and really tender... - Vegetables cooked well, not soggy has a nice bite - Plenty of rice... you won't be hungry!! - Daily Soup is pear soup, perfect for the hot weather  Where is Go Go China?   It is inside the food court of Chartwell!   But don't take your date there, unless you want to make an impression of how thrifty (cheap) you are!"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly service.  I am going to be honest...When my boyfriend and I got ready to order Chinese one Sunday night, Go Go China was not our first, second, or even third choice, due to the rating it had on Yelp (two stars).  However, because it was the only place open that delivered to our area, we decided to give it a try. Boy, were we pleasantly surprised!  We ordered their shrimp fried rice, beef with vegetables (would probably ask for extra meat next time), egg drop soup, and cream cheese wontons.  Everything was delicious!  The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because I have two favorite Chinese restaurants in Iowa that are impossible to beat.  We will be ordering Go Go China again in the near future, I am sure."}
{"text":"I was really curious about the crappy reviews. So I ordered delivery. People are right, portions are small, but the flavors are good. The rice was stale-that was sad. The food arrived hot, but the General Tsos Tofu was soggy. We ate everything, but it wasn't spectacular. Basically it's a bit over priced, and they need to deal with the rice differently. Since 3 stars is A-OK, this is 2 and a half stars. Yelpers nailed it."}
{"text":"if you're looking for 5 star New York or San Francisco Chinatown chinese you won't find it here but if you are looking for good neighborhood take out this is your place. the Maricopa County Health Department is one of the toughest in the country so if this place is dirty it wouldn't be open."}
{"text":"Called for pick-up. Asked for large fried rice, returned home to see Small fried rice. When called them, they say it was their mistake and we could return to get a larger size...who would travel back 7miles in 108deg summer afternoon?  Asked them to make my dish spicy and they charge $0.50 to add chilli oil into it? I am like Hell with you guys! They are just money makers... portion size not good, quality just okay.. I would say, try another place and skip this one."}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese place I order from. They are very good with delivery, always on time, and always have the exact thing I order. This place should have more stars, they don't have five star food by any means, but you get the good value you pay for. Best Chinese delivery in the area. Ordered from \"Yang House\" twice, and was very disappointed they never delivered what I ordered, so I looked else where and found this nice little gem.  BY THE WAY, this place is real NY style Chinese; if you order chow mein (like our friend Nicole H. here) you will get no noodles. If noodles are included in the dish you want, read the menu, and order lo mein."}
{"text":"My first time here. I ordered chicken with garlic sauce, hot & sour soup and chicken rice soup (in place of sizzling rice soup, which they did not have). The chicken with garlic sauce was the best of the three. The flavor was good and had a good amount of chicken and veggies. It also has some kick to it. The rice in the chicken rice soup soaked up all the broth making it rather gross. The hot & sour soup was also a huge disappointment. The broth was thin like chicken soup - there was absolutely no thickness to it, which I'm used to. It only had a couple pieces of chicken.   The only pro was that it was open late."}
{"text":"Mainly take out or delivery, always liked the beef chow fun which I'd the best dish that they serve.   Sketchy on the cleanliness but good tasting food, but some of the best hole in the wall restaurants have come from questionable places.  What you don't know won't hurt you so let's keep it that way."}
