{"text":"I had lunch there and was really impressed.  I had the Tempura Udon which was alright, but nothing to get excited about.  The caterpillar roll was very good, but not enough to save the entire experience"}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place. Because it is close to where I work, but also because it is delicious, consistent and fast with great staff and very welcoming atmosphere.  I started going here just to get take-out, but it's so nice to be there, I usually eat in the restaurant.  And the appetizers on the house... LOVE that!"}
{"text":"They are still in the temporary location and the best thing about it is that they serve bottled spring water."}
{"text":"The restaurant gives off a very nice vibe, it has an open concept which I like. It's also nice to see the chef making your sushi. The service was great, they are very friendly and the food was delicious! The best sushi I have ever had! They took their time to make it just perfect. The presentation was also very nice! Price is reasonable for the amount of sushi you are getting and the variety is good as well."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here, and returned two days later for dinner with friends. I judge sushi joints by their sea urchin roe. Fresh and delicious!   Staff was prompt and fun. Will be nice when they finally get in their new digs. For now, worth the trouble to search out."}
{"text":"This place is now called Gonoe sushi, but aside from the name change, everything else stayed the same (maybe the prices increased by a bit as well). What I like about this place is that they do the sushi right: a bit of rice with fish on top thats gliding over the rice, unlike other places where the rice comes in big chunks and fills you up quickly. They also give you little things from the chef as well (noodle soup and sometimes fried tofu - both of which are very good). The stuff is attentive and remember you. And for Christmas they always give you little souvenirs, which is no other place does!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Ichiban franchised restaurants where the food and service are both equally impeccable. Wait staff here is the best! They make you really feel like you're the only person there! The ambience is nice and the servings are generous. The food I had was of excellent quality and tasted very good (dynamite roll, salmon salad roll etc). The fish was very fresh and all the ingredients were amazing. Great sushi compared to the other restaurants in this area where I'm sure you can get for a cheaper price but for the Beaches, this is the best deal and best quality that comes along with lots of freebies."}
{"text":"Came here because I assumed since Ichiban was a franchised restaurant, it would taste the same at any location since I gave the one on Queens Quay a good rating. I found out that I was definitely wrong; the taste and quality of the sushi solely depend on the chef who makes it. The sushi here was dull in flavour, not very fresh ingredients as the rice was VERY DRY, the maki rolls did not melt in my mouth as they were very hard to chew. Yeah, it was nice that the restaurant gave us a few freebies (miso soup and calamari) but it still didn't impress me much. Food was nothing special, nothing to die for or recommend."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit this little restaurant and it was a great experience. The food was absolutely delicious and fresh. I had an assortment of makis (sushi rolls) and every single one of them were excellent. I regularly have sushi and these were some of the best. The fish was very fresh (no fishy smell) and all the ingredients were top notch. What differentiates them from other sushi restaurants are the amount of rice they put into the rolls and the texture of it. They try not to put a lot of rice which is what I like about them since this is what often makes you full quicker and also unlike other places where the rice is super dry, the makis here are actually soft and moist so when you eat them, they literally melt in your mouth. I think this place is definitely fantastic and I highly recommend it. The service is impeccable, the ambience great and servings are incredibly generous. I will be back"}
{"text":"My wife and i had the \"lover's course\".  Sashimi melted in my mouth; tempura was fantastic; server was very polite.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spicy salmon sushi pizzas can be found at this place... Hooked to this sushi pizza as well as their salmon lover roll (that's all I ever order lol) Great service as well."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and very high quality sushi. My wife and I eat at this restaurant several times a month, and all the staff there not only remember our names, but orders and even remembered to leave shrimp of my Kame Sushi order when I forgot to ask.  If you call in orders they will be completed promptly, and their beef Udon is to die for. Would definitely recommend this friendly family restaurant to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"My good friend George and I have come here a couple of times. Had a taste for sushi so got on the tram next to my hotel and buzzed over to Bally's. Regular Japanese style food. Sushi, miso soup, and some hot tea did the trick. I was appreciative of the waitress to steer me away from the \"baby scallop roll\"  Everything else was good."}
{"text":"Based on service, authenticity, food, and price this place gets 5 stars. It is in the basement of ballys past the food court. (Keep going you'll find it).     Yes it's tiny. Yes the food is great. Our waitress was attentive polite and charming. We got 4 rolls for about $40.      Our food took awhile so our server gave us edamame and salad for free.      On the whole this was probably the best meal I had in Vegas. This includes a meal at the palm steak house in Caesars palace which was pricey and great also.    Atmosphere is quiet and chill. Go there man."}
{"text":"I heard that it was a franchise a few years ago and then I ate at another place by the same name and it was terrible.  So beware, this is the ONLY Ichiban Sushi restaurant in Toronto that is worth eating at. At least that Ive tried so far.  The cuts are really clean, the staff is super nice, they will even remember you and your order after only a few times through the door, and the portions are decent.  They dont do delivery, but if you live in the area, this is the only place youre doing pick up from for sure.  Its also really good for vegetarians. Great non fish selection if you happen to be eating with a vegan."}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner on the way home from the CNE because we have a sushi craving. We love the little cubicles, made us reminisced over our trip to Japan last spring. The hostess is very friendly, attentive, and efficient in making sure we settled in, bringing us our menu and water, and checking in throughout the meals. We also get a free appetizer on the house, extra salad for our daughters, and free dessert (canteloupe to cleanse the palate after an enjoyable meal). The food is fresh and cook to order. The portion is generous. We ordered 3 mains, 2 appetizers, and an assortment of maki and hand rolls for a family of 5. We left very full. We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We were headed to California from Utah and wanted some sushi early in the morning.  This was one of the few restaurants open at 8 am so we decided to try it out. Unfortunately we weren't able to get sushi since they don't serve it until 11am. We were still glad they had a breakfast menu which included American and Japanese breakfast as well as handful of noodle bowl options.    I had the Japanese breakfast and my girlfriend got the deep fried sweet tofu upon bowl. The miso soup was excellent and my breakfast was mostly really tasty. It had small portions of grilled salmon, rice, oranges, cantaloupe, soy beans, seaweed salad, and a regular salad with a light ginger dressing. Everything was delicious sans the fermented soybeans, but I'll attribute that to my own personal taste. It was also served with green tea which was great.   The udon bowl was pretty typical, nothing fancy and the broth and noodles were good. The deep fried sweet tofu was kind of  different, but still kind of tasty.   Just as note, their actual restaurant is still under construction and has been for 14 months. The server there mentioned that construction has stopped currently and the don't know when it'll be done. Overall, we really enjoyed our breakfast at Ichiban."}
{"text":"Was hoping to get a nice bento box for lunch.  I ordered, then noticed the microwave - everything was going into that bad boy.  When I got to my desk and unloaded the bag I noticed that the small container for the salad was only about 1/4 full and the tomato looked nasty, then I managed to spill the very soupy bulgogi sauce from a closed contained all over my pants.  The portions are tiny and the taste simply does not exist.  I enjoyed that they put lots of veggies in the bulgogi, but when you can tell they had freezer burn on them it's time to throw in the towel and say I just won't be going back."}
{"text":"Do not eat at this place..WAY OVERPRICED for ok Sushi...   I had lunch today and waited 40 min to get my 3 rolls. the restuarant was empty. I asked what the hold up was and was told that  the chef was doing inventory???? I was like can i get some Edamme while I wait?  The rolls came out and let's just say for $17.95 for a rainbow roll you would expect a good roll... It wasn't... Then to top it off I was charged $4.95 for the edamme???? i was like WTH???   I would stay away from this place....."}
{"text":"Always really friendly, Ichiban Sushi (which I don't think is connected to the chain of the same name) is a great place for quick bite of lunch or a longer dinner. Their lunch specials of Sushi and Sashimi are fresh and well priced. Great place for Sushi in King West!"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi, with a good vegetarian selection.  Apparently, if you eat in, the service is fantastic (free samples, large portions, cheerful  servers), but we got take-out so missed out on all that.    The food is tasty and reasonably priced, but the lunch special is supposed to come with dessert, which they left out of our take-away boxes.  (Makes sense if it's something like green tea ice cream, but there's no discount for take-out.)  I'd go back and eat there next time."}
{"text":"What's happened to this place? I've been living in the beach for 5 years and this is where I always went for local sushi. The last time I went I wasn't too impressed but thought  I'd give it another try since I've had 20 + good experiences. Tonight I ordered the toro sushi and it was leather! I told the waitress it was awful. She came back with the bill with it still on the check so I said I'm surprised you left that on when I told you it was awful and couldn't eat the second piece. Her response was \" the chef says its fresh\" well this patron says it leather. Two strikes you're out ichiban. Is it new management or a new sushi chef? Not sure but there are a few other decent places in the beach that I will take my sushi craving to."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place when I'm in the area.  The sushi is really fresh and the staff are friendly and polite. There aren't any remarkable sushi dishes, but you're bound to get tasty sushi, so you can't really go wrong. Their signature rolls are all pretty good, though I would recommend the Queen's Quay above the other ones. Their other rolls are all pretty good. If you can't decide, then I'll have to recommend their Rainbow roll since you get a good idea of how fresh their cuts of fish are. They also make damn good unagi hand rolls.  They are better than the ordinary fare, so this place is good when you're craving sushi, and you know you can't get into Mi-Ne sushi because it's too damn small and crowded. It's not out of this world amazing sushi, but it's good, and really convenient since it's usually not very busy.   4 to 5 stars for the pleasant service, and an honest 3.5 stars for food, but it gets rounded up to 4 since we're in Toronto and you really can't get amazing sushi here."}
{"text":"Was watching a Japan-themed movie and my friend and I decided that sushi would be the perfect post-movie dinner. It was late, but when we arrived, we were still greeted warmly, given a complimentary appetizer, and thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  Really well-priced for the quality! We both got sushi combo sets - really simple, so no spicy mayo or deep fried whatever that normally mask poor quality fish. My friend, who lived in BC for many years (where, as I recall, the sushi fish is *super* fresh tasting), thought the sushi here was very good.  Lastly, I'm kinda grossed out by salmon sushi lately - it tastes fatty and artificial to me - so, not sure if this place gets a different type or cut of salmon, but it is by FAR the best raw salmon I've had for a LONG time."}
{"text":"I love this place!   It's cozy, the wait staff are incredibly friendly and the sashimi is delicious.   I warn you though, this four star rating only applies to the consistent high quality  of the SASHIMI.  My boyfriend isn't a sushi fan, so we've never eaten it at this restaurant.    Tips:  Order the Pink Flower roll.   Yum!  And - don't go on a Monday."}
{"text":"Located across the street from St. Lawrence Market on Wellington/Church St.  I thought their dynamite sushi was mediocre and the rolls were smaller than average. Their crab salad and pizza sushi were quite delicious though. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I frequently order takeout and they often give you complimentary miso soup and salad. The dressing on the salad is very vinegary .. It tastes like they just simply poured mirin on it. The miso soup however was amazing .. You could taste that they actually use miso paste in their soup.  The sushi is OK. The eel roll had a sweet sauce on top that tasted good.. Not great but good . In the dynamite roll they don't remove the shrimp shell which I find somewhat disturbing."}
{"text":"Terrible two women.  the rice is wet and I ask for change, but they just blablabla in Chinese. No recommend and will never back again. Food is so normal and the attitude is terrible."}
{"text":"Excellent service! For a non- sushi lover I wad impressed with the selection of other types of food. Deep fried jalepeno's stuffed with tuna  Loved the food and enjoyed the service! Our server was so helpful and adorable!"}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive Vegas find, smack in the heart of the strip, hidden away on the bottom level of Bally's (near the Sbarro). Got edamame and two rolls for just under $20, so not terribly overpriced either. Portions were generous, and food tasted fresh. Great service as well. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Incredibly welcoming and friendly staff!  Commonly mentioned on Yelp for a reason.  Sushi is great, sashimi is great, everything I've had on the menu is great and I've probably been here a good couple dozen times.  The chef constantly gives appetizers on the house too.  The actual atmosphere is nice.  Warm, cozy, clean and quiet.  I really can't complain, but I'm also not a sushi snob, so maybe this review should be taken with a grain of salt.  I do know fresh sushi when I have it and they haven't let me down yet."}
{"text":"Reliably excellent. I come here all the time for take out (so I can eat in my pjs). Great great place. I hope they never leave."}
{"text":"Call me a sushi snob, but I'm not a fan of any sashimi that is still thawing  the middle.   All ingredients are clearly not fresh which is a necessity for my sushi enjoyment.  Skip this one."}
{"text":"I should have listened to my gut instinct and not ordered here.   I had come here years ago and vowed to not go back, but I was lazy and it was cold out and  didn't want to walk to Mine Sushi on Bremner which was just a bit further down. So I decided to give Ichiban another go.   I ordered two rolls for takeout, a specialty sunshine roll (cucumber roll with spicy tuna on top), and spicy salmon maki. After she handed the takeout box, it was so light, when I got back and cracked the box open the rolls were miniscule. Taste was nothing to write home about either so there was no saving grace.   Yes they have a 10% cash discount ( of which I used,) but even that's not enough to overcome how overpriced the food was!"}
{"text":"this was conveniently located for me on a business trip. Walking in, the restaurant was almost empty but I was greeted warmly, and my server was uniformly good, attentive, and polite. the sushi was not Class AAA, but definitely good enough for a weekday meal. I ordered salmon, yellowtail and scallop sashimi, and amaebi and unagi sushi, and a salmon skin roll. It was fresh and had the right taste (except for the amaebi, but then what am I really doing ordering amaebi in a neighborhood restaurant/) and you either get 2 pieces of sushi per order or 3 slices of sashimi for the same price (obviously I took 3, what's some rice/seaweed??). I've had much better salmon skin rolls though. Avoid that. What won me over, though, was a complimentary mini-bowl of noodles and a separate almost amuse-bouche-like platter (really? yes) of age tofu. Yes. I can definitely be bribed like that."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch and got lunch specials. Standard teriyaki fare which I thought was average. My sister got tenpura udon which was very plain, just noodles and broth. No green onion or egg, nothing. My dad had ika sushi which he said was very fresh. So I think this place probably fares better in sushi than bento."}
{"text":"We went late one night about 35 minutes before closing. We were the only patrons at that time and were treated very well. The service was excellent as was my wife's chicken teriyaki and my tempura and noodles. If we go back to Toronto, we will be sure to go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sushi and value, that's what this place is all about.  If you're interested in paying for the decor and beautiful waitresses, don't come here.  If you are a Benihanas person, there are better places for you.  If you're rating Katsu-ya 4 and 5 stars in (Los Angeles), this is probably not your cup of tea.  If you like simple, authentic, fresh sushi at very reasonable prices considering the location on the strip, I highly recommend this place.  If it matters to you, most of the staff, including the sushi chef, is Japanese.  The average rating is way too low, but to each his own."}
{"text":"I went to this place June 9th and it was pretty quiet, the people were super friendly and the food was decent though my only big complaint was that when i went their for lunch with my two friends we had all ordered about the same 2 rolls, and a salad/miso soup and the order for the girl came right away and then 20 minutes after her food came and she had finished it. Our food for had finally came, and there was no one was in the restaurant besides us. Its just when i go out to lunch with friends i like to eat together.. So that was disappointing. But the food was good, average not outstanding but not bad."}
{"text":"Eh. Ate this chicken-veggie-egg dish on steamed rice. Was okay. Miso soup was pretty bland. Salad dressing was good. Server was very friendly though, which gives me guilt."}
{"text":"I am blown away there could be a  low review of this place. Best find in Vegas.  Yes, it is in a casino (Ballys), however it is very close to an exterior door and the monorail entrance. It is directly across from the Bally's sports book.  It is DEFINITELY not expensive based on the quality of food nor is it expensive based on typical Vegas standards. The atmosphere is absolutely nothing but who cares?  Close your eyes & eat some great great sushi!"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday for lunch and ordered the salmon teriyaki lunch bento box. Portions are tiny! Miso soup was too salty and their california roll was 80% cucumber with just hints of avocado and crab meat. The vegetable sides were basically just boiled in water with no flavour or seasoning."}
{"text":"I was there this past weekend, went there on a Sunday Night with my husband and Brother in law. I absolutely fell in love with sushi at this restaurant. The food was was so good that the day after me and my husband were thinking about it, could not stop talking about how good the food was. My brother in law was even telling us how he loved the Dragon roll. My favorite roll was the Jalapeno Bomb Roll, delicious."}
{"text":"Used Yelp to find this sweet spot....... hidden away in the Bally's Strip mall you wouldn't think for a second that this place would be worth stopping for....but STOP!!!! Fresh Fish!!! OK were downtown Vegas and some of these high dollar spots are dropping Bad fish on people so to find a lil spot that still cares is refreshing..."}
{"text":"A real keeper. Quality sashimi , generous and cheap by Vegas standards. I'll be back here a few times!!!"}
{"text":"From the very beginning this place had me smiling. we were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. one waitress was serving the whole place (even though its small) and everyone was still smiling. me and my companion ordered spicy salmon roll, salmon and avocado roll as well as spicy tuna and salmon skin hand rolls. A M A Z I N G!!! the fish was so fresh you could not tell it was fish. the wakame salad i ordered was different (big dark leafy not the light green stringy) but still very very good. fast and friendly service during lunch hour downtown is a hard combo to find, but you will find it here. highly recommend this place. I'll be back later this week and the next.  for a quick lunch bellow 20 dollars i was happy to leave her 5 as a tip. absolutely satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"the real thing its not \"bunch of folks from Hong Kong as one reviewer said  it's the real thing - Japanese owners, staff (and the night I went) - Customers! and the sushi was the real thing! - the yellowtail and the eel were both excellent -  salmon skin very fresh and delicious  - place is being remodeled, but i looked past that as should you =- good food comes in all sizes and shapes  great food - would come back"}
{"text":"This is extremely hole in the wall inside of the BALLYS hotel down one level where all the shops are. Hard to find but way worth it. The food was terrific and delicious. The prices were very reasonable but the service was outstanding. My server tonight was IVY and she was very friendly and gave great suggestion. She was accommodating to our wants and requests and a great host. I'd definitely recommend this place to others. Please find this place. It's worth the effort."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall place. Great service, no waiting and food taste good."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant.  It's still in the basement conference room around the corner from The Book.  They said they'd be back in their normal location in July--hopefully.  Food was delicious and the service is very good.    I flew in from New York for a trade show and entered around 7:30PM--not a soul to be seen.  Was super-worried but not long after I ordered my food, the place was packed--with mostly Japanese regulars who seemed to know the employees/owners.    I normally scarf two-roll lunch-specials with miso soup and remain hungry.  I ordered two rolls and a soup and my god--I LEFT FOOD ON THE TABLE.  The rice was fresh, pillowy and soft and the fish was fresh.  About half the clientele ordered soba or udon noodles.  They must be good here, too."}
{"text":"Sometimes after another late party night in Vegas, you don't really wake up craving regular breakfast (since you dont even wake up until 1 pm anyway), and greasy ass burgers and fries just don't sound that good either.    Staying at the Flamingo, I remebered seeing this Japanese joint right next door in Bally's (located in the back where the sportsbook/pool/monorail is).    They have a great Bento lunch set (3 types) all around $9-12 which is a cheap lunch for Vegas that isn't McDonalds/Quiznos. Their beer prices aren't too bad compared to most restaurants in the area (around $4, compared to the $6 in other places). We had a big group so we ordered almost 1 of everything on the menu, so I got to try out a lot of what they had to offer.  The sushi, chicken teriyaki, soba, udon, tempura, and salad were not the best i've had. However, they were still of good quality, came out quick, our service was friendly, and the food was delicious...and yes we were all sober at that time...so we could make good judgement.  By the way their fried Squid which came out looking like Katsu was delicious too.     If you're around the area (considering I wouldn't go too out of my way to get here if I was somewhere like Mandalay or Treasure Island), and like us just not craving the typical burger fries/pizza...this excellently priced delicious Japanese food is definitely worth a stop.   ~G"}
{"text":"This is literally the worst sushi I've ever had. If you look at some of my reviews, you'll notice that I mostly review Japanese restaurants... I might not be a sushi chef, but I can at least tell when fish is fresh or not.   I'm not saying they served me product that had gone bad, but there is literally no way I am ever coming back here to eat again. My friends and I had a Sushi Boat B, tempura, and one of my other friends ordered a chicken teriyaki.   The sushi boat was kind of pathetic and the fish selection was low even with sixty pieces. The red snapper and grouper were horrendous (the kind I've come to expect at all you can eat Japanese places), the salmon was off, and their two varieties of tuna were both bland. Even the pickled ginger and miso soup were off! The Miso soup was not flavourful at all, and the pickled ginger had been cut up really strangely so it was extra dry.   Our salad had vegetables that didn't seem fresh (refrigerated for too long, improperly dressed) and the ice cream we got had a ridiculous case of freezer burn (instead of ice cream, it has the consistency of snow/slurpees) and the cantaloupe was not sweet either.   The tempura that we got had yams that weren't cooked enough...  It costed us $59.99 for that cruddy boat and $8 for two shrimp tempura along with a couple pieces of yam and squash.   Not impressed. For the same price range I could have gone to Wow Sushi, or at the very least Kaizen which is close by.   TO SUM THIS UP: Why go to a place that serves fish that is worse than the quality of all you can eat for all you can eat prices? We wouldn't have just gotten three ice creams and four miso soups for five people either (they asked us to buy more in case we wanted anything else).    At the very least, if we had gone to an all you can eat place we'd have been able to eat five non freezer burnt ice creams and had all the miso soup we wanted. Probably just paid like $5 more too, for fresher fish and better service. (Did I mention it took forever to settle our bill because the waitress randomly disappeared for like 20 minutes?) Seems like other people already knew better since the restaurant was empty the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place, and will make it a point to visit every time we get back to Las Vegas!   My husband and I went here as our first dinner as a married couple after getting hitched @ the Vegas sign.  Before even knowing this our sweet and adorable waitress presented us with two shots of chilled sake which was absolutely delicious.  I had never had sake before, and I LOVE it!   We ordered four different rolls (I honestly don't remember which ones now) and they were all absolutely fresh and delicious.  We sat at the bar and were able to watch them being made for us.    My husband thanked the waitress for her kindness and informed her that we had just gotten married, so we really appreciated the hospitality and she disappeared really quick and came back with some shots of flavored sake which were even better!   We were all done eating and requested our check, and it turned out the guy sitting down at the end of the bar from us had PAID for our meal!!!   After finding this out, and my husband and I almost cried at all the kindness in such a strange new place (this was our first visit to vegas - i had dreams of being married in Vegas by Elvis since i was a little girl) our waitress came out of the back room with a sundae for us!   It was seriously the best experience we had while we were there.  I cannot wait to visit again!   The employees here are so sweet and the food is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed lunch here.  Learning about Japanese culture is a hobby of mine, including learning the language and food.  So I enjoy a chance to eat at Japanese restaurant.  The signs and menus all had both English and Japanese.  That's usually a good sign, it means they expect to serve people from Japan who know what how Japanese food should taste.  It also usually means the staff speaks Japanese, so I can get in a bit of practice ordering in Japanese.  I decided to go with a \"bento\" box lunch special.  I like \"bento\", because it is the traditional Japanese lunch, and I get to try little tastes of different things.  In this case, the bento came with miso soup, rice, salad, vegetable and shrimp tempura, and chicken terriyaki.  All were very good.  I was impressed by the quality of the chicken meat, and how light the terriyaki sause was (instead of the usual heavy, sticky, syrupy terriyaki).  I topped it off with a cold Sapporo beer.  A very satisfying lunch.  The staff was also very nice, greeting us with the traditional \"Irrashai!\".  My wife is not very experienced with chopsticks, and the waitress provided her a set of \"chopstick helpers\" to make it easier for her to eat.  She tolerated my ordering in Japanese without any problems.  And she quickly provided my wife with an extra helping of terriyaki sauce when asked.  I only had a few minor complaints.  Our waitress was occassionally busy doing other tasks and sometimes took a while to check on us.  And the menu was a bit more limited than some places.    Overall, this was a nice, casual, quiet place for a good lunch.  I would be happy to go there again."}
{"text":"Good authentic Japanese cuisine.  I very much enjoyed my oyako donburi and a few Kirins."}
{"text":"I would say, this is one of the best sushi place that I ever went. the service was excellent, they served us really good, the people were super nice, The food was awesome, I had shrimp tempura which is came with miso soup, salad and rice.. awesome.. my husband had sushi (super delicious) and udon, he seems satisfied.. the chef I think is really japanese, so they now what they were doin. I came from maryland which you never see any sushi chef that were japanese.. ahaha.. so, they deserved my 5 stars.."}
{"text":"I am no sushi eater but, I can ate the tempura vegies, steamed rice, bbq chicken and they were very good. The misso soup was fresh made however, after having eaten at Wazuzu in the Encore,  it was not as good as their misso soup. The service is quick.  The prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"Tasted fresh. I ordered the ahi poke. Service was good and the fish tasted fresh. Little heavy on the soy. Not too much diversity in the rolls. Menu in japanese/english to cater to both cultures."}
{"text":"what a hell the miso soup and rice! yuck!!!!! That's my soup and rice is wayyyyy better than theirs! But Tempra and Soba were yummy!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today and after seeing the shape their open kitchen area was in (messy w tempura batter splattered all over the deep fryer)  - we decided not to order sushi but  to order Bento boxes w Teriyaki - one chicken one salmon. Both salads were old with too much dressing; broccoli was yellowed, rice was totally bland and both chicken and salmon seemed microwaved with too much sauce. The sushi rolls included weren't fresh.   Sad to say we think the place had no customers for a reason."}
{"text":"First time going there for dinner, and I'm beyond impressed. The food was delicious. We took the boat: a mix of sushi and sashimi. We also received complimentary miso soup, salad and fruit for dessert. Fish was fresh and sushi wasn't dry. The staff was friendly and welcoming. They made sure that you were well taken care off. The chef kept asking if the food was to our liking.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"Expensive and you will leave hungry.  We spent over 50 $ on dinner and it felt like an appetizer.  The waitress was attentive, to our neighbors, but could care less about our table.  She spoke very little english which made it hard to communicate with her.  Save your money on the sushi and hit somewhere else."}
{"text":"Really nice place with quality and fresh food (I saw the chef going to the supermarket around the corner more than once to buy fresh produce).   Cozy spot, affordable, friendly waitresses... Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Plus side: service was excellent. Price was more than acceptable considering the location (inside of Bally's food court/shopping area).  Neutral: tempura is entirely ordinary. Quality of the sashimi isn't bad.  Minus side: everything else. \"Isn't bad\" isn't exactly acceptable at this price, although it's not like we were expecting quality either. The sashimi is just barely \"isn't bad\" while the salmon was... well it wouldn't been okay if it was a third cheaper. That about sums up most of the meal...  Awful: the spicy yellowtail roll was so bad I can't even remember what it tastes like anymore. I think I was just eating it because I realized I'd already paid for it, and didn't want it to go to waste.  I know Vegas is pricey and I know I'm not going to be getting great or even very good sushi from a place like this, but given the price I was hoping it'd at least be okay. Next time, I'll spend 1/3rd the money and go get pizza somewhere, or make the drive to get something that's actually enjoyable..."}
{"text":"Average sushi.  Prices a bit higher then average.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Not bad... But I prefer one of the other two places on Queens Quay- oyshi (at yonge) or Guirei (near spadina)."}
{"text":"At first this place looked great, well kept, the waitress was friendly... but then we ran into some trouble.  We started with the vegetable tempura, which was good, however the six pieces were distributed in only two kinds of vegetable: squash and sweet potato. Come on, throw in some bell peppers, carrots, or even onions... show some variety. But so far, so good.  For the main courses we ordered some rolls and also the \"Sashimi & Sushi Combo, 12 pieces\". The rolls came first - it was not what we expected, but that was not really their fault; we didn't pay close attention to the ingredients of that kind of roll.  The combo then arrived with 20 pieces instead of 12: sashimi, sushi and 4 extra pairs of rolls. I checked if we misunderstood the menu again, but no, it was clear that it should be 12 pieces of sashimi and sushi, and no rolls. Upon inquiring the server, she told us that it's not in the menu but they serve rolls with all combos.  You may ask: \"Well, who complains about extra food?\" Maybe I was raised differently than many people, but I simply hate throwing food away, and furthermore, if we knew that there were rolls included with the combo, we wouldn't order the first batch of rolls which we didn't even like.  From there it was all downhill. We asked the lady if she could replace the rolls with sashimi, because they are smaller, and she was very concerned - no, not about our satisfaction, but with the financial health of the business. Yes, she told us that, in these exact words: \"we won't replace one roll for one sashimi because it's more expensive\".  Good for you! Keep every cent of my money, for the first and last time."}
{"text":"I needed to grab a meal to go before I went in to work and they got me in and out in 10 mins - and they served me a yummy noodle and tempura soup while I waited! Great service and delicious fish!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem under Ballys. We had some great fish and prompt service. Will be back next time I'm in the area. Booyah!"}
{"text":"Definitely expected more from all the good reviews, but was disappointed.  My friend and I ordered:  Udon with Egg - great broth, yummy noodles, but only 1 egg.. Double Spicy Tuna Roll - bland, not spicy. AT ALL.  Hawaiian Poke Salad - strong soy sauce flavor. I love poke salad that's tangy with sweet and savory so this didn't float my boat.   The tuna didn't taste fresh. I'm used to great quality sushi and big flavor in CA and Ichiban was subpar. Service was good. Value was not there. My friend and I spent more than enough to pay for AYCE @ Sushi on Tropicana. We should have done that..."}
{"text":"This is our favourite sushi place in the Beach, and not just because it's close by. The quality is always very good, the service is attentive and friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. They are also very generous with freebies, including soup, veggie pancakes, deep-fried tofu and a half orange for dessert (I want to know where they get their yummy oranges from!)."}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby and best friend. Apparently he comes here with his co workers often, or so our bank account told me.  Its place deep into Bally's where the food court is located. Its off to the right and can be easily found.  Its a nice, quiet small restaurant where they make the food fresh and right in front of you. Not to be racist but i get a kick that its a mexican making the sushi. It brought a smile to my face and a \"i told you so\" from the husband.  Waitress was very friendly, quick with service, answered my questions about different dishes and was reasonably priced.   Ordered the lunch combination special, terryaki bowl. Very good and filling. I even had left overs. best friend and I decided to share the fried ice cream. OMG it was soo good and light. The fried part was very fluffy and not like mexican fried ice cream. it was tasty and big enough for all 3 of us to split. I was very impressed. its always fantastic to end a good meal with a mind blowing dessert."}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive staff. The food was fresh and well made for the price. It took them a while to prepare the order though."}
{"text":"Every piece of sashimi we ordered had bones in it. The fish quality seemed alright, but every bite was hazardous. Had to throw the entire order out."}
{"text":"Okay the Sushi was tasty and the atmosphere was fun if not contrived. But we are in the posh part of Tuscon.  If you are young and rich come hang here :) We had lunch specials and the sushi and sashimi and it was a relatively good deal with soup and salad. Ordered some individual pieces and they are a bit pricy. Quality fresh and wait staff (in our case the bartender) polite and prompt. we say outside at the high tops - open seating."}
{"text":"This place is great when you dont want to get all fancy on sushi and need a low-key place.  Whenever I go here, I usually get their bento box of chicken teriyaki.  With the box, you get miso soup, salad, tempura and rice/chicken.  The chicken is grilled and done to perfection.    I've also had their rolls of the Double spicy tuna roll which was delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi.  Real japanese waitresses, which is always a plus.  Price isn't too bad for Vegas sushi joint.  I really enjoyed all their hand rolls (salmon, spicy salmon, tuna, and spciy tuna).  They have large selection of really good sake.  WARNING, don't drink the whole bottle by yourself, always share :)  Good environment, and staffs are really nice.  Service is quite fast and they are always prompt."}
{"text":"The interior, the facade and hand-written signs are dated, but don't be fooled. They do sushi well. The price is right and the fish is fresh. This is a great place to take out or eat-in. Staff are always very nice. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Sushi for days over here in Vegas, but truth be told it's all just so-so for anyone living in Cali.   The main point I wanted to drop about Ichiban is that they have a phenomenal server named Pen. She is one of the sweetest, most genuinely kind people I've ever seen in this role.   Friendly right from the get go. She kept coming back, answering questions, checking on things for us. She brought us a sample of a unique type of potato we had never heard of, cut fresh by the chef just because we seemed curious. I learned a few things that day, about huge rice balls and the fact that I do not like that potato..   Anyway, the food was solid. We had just rolled into town and needed food \"stat\" as the doctor would say. I would have said 3 stars because the meal did what it was supposed to; filled us up and didn't cost an arm and a leg, but Pen's service jumped it up another one just by being great.   *tips sake glass for Pen*"}
{"text":"The sushi here is good, but not great. The flavors are there and the fish quality is good, but the butchering is poor. The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is typical of a small neighborhood sushi bar. It is a bit expensive, but that is what you have to expect for sushi in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Some of the best tasting, and freshest Sushi in the city. Typical decor of most \"average\" run of the mill sushi places, but the food and the service are above average for this city."}
{"text":"Friday, thank god it's Friday. My friends were craving for sushi so they suggested this location. I've order the uni sashimi, I don't think the uni tasted that fresh. I didn't like it at all.  The sashimi combo did not taste good at all, from the salmon sashimi, butter fish, I didn't enjoy any of the sashimi in the lunch set. Some foodcourt quality is better. Honestly Don't think I will be coming back, at least for a long time!"}
{"text":"Good Japanese food in an informal setting. Large menu and reasonable prices, but not exceptional.  It gets a four."}
{"text":"My group and I had to eat before going to the Electronic Daisy Carnival in Vegas and we were craving sushi. The place is a tiny restaurant located in the lower level of Bally's Hotel and Casino. The staff was very friend. The decor was nothing amazing. For being a sushi restaurant in Vegas, the prices were reasonable. The sushi was fresh and the tempura udon was DELICIOUS. 4 rolls, udon, pot stickers, edamame, miso soup, and green tea cost about $75. There was not a thing left on our plates. I highly recommend it for cheap(er) sushi on the strip. Great and friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ichiban sushi a couple of times now when I'm really craving some Japanese fare and I'm not desperate enough to go to the Loblaws that is literally across the street at lunch. Overall, their food is good - but not great. I'm on a sashimi kick these days and everything is pretty fresh (as fresh as frozen for 6 days and flown overseas can be right?) with the exception of their butterfish which tastes like a fishy ice cube. Like it tastes like essence of fish...in slushy ice cube form. Yes, that's how I'm gonna describe it.  I would actually place this restaurant around a 2.5 star but I'll kick in the extra .5 star for the fact that last time we were in here Kai LITERALLY ruined the place, including pushing the owners son to the floor and throwing edamame beans at the other guests. The waitress didn't even bat an eye!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fried dumplings and the dynamic roll with tuna as takeout. Wait time was around 10 minutes so not bad at all.   I actually really like the fried dumplings, they were crispy and the meat inside was warm and tasted good too. The sushi was good too. They added some sauce to the tuna which made it really good."}
{"text":"The staff and chef here have an utter disregard for their clientele's health and will lie to make sales. Went into this place a while back and told them I had a gluten allergy (celiac). I specifically asked about the sushi seasoning and gluten in different ingredients, and they said, \"No gluten. No gluten.\" They served me a vegetable roll with tempura in it, gave me regular soy sauce (which has wheat in it), and poured a thick, dark brown sauce all over my salmon roll, which I'm 98% sure had gluten in it. I took one bit of the veggie roll and spit it out once I tasted the tempura. I will never go back."}
{"text":"horrendous!  nice service, but the food was unbearable...not fresh and things were nuked...wouldnt return"}
{"text":"Very standard Japanese food, nothing out of the ordinary. Waitresses are really nice and polite. Prices are affordable, absolutely nothing makes this restaurant unique. Oh by the way, this place isn't a restaurant (yet?), it's a conference room with 8 tables. You will laugh when you see the place. They bring in the food from a kitchen outside of the restaurant and it gets pushed in a little trolley with your food covered in plastic wrap. Hilarious, really. The fish is fresh so go ahead and order that to your hearts content; the regular food is pretty standard and nothing you haven't had before. Try it out if you're tired of fancy food and sick of the McDonald's dollar menu."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hour at noon. The restaurant was still pretty empty. Service was excellent and it was owned by Korean. We had salmon and beef bento boxes and it was only soso. We ordered maki appetizer and the fish was not fresh. I could taste this really strong fishy taste in my maki. Overall I wouldn't come here again if there were more Japanese restaurant that's not too far of a walking distance near my work."}
{"text":"While I appreciate the quaint and traditional interior of Ichiban, there just wasn't anything about it that made it stand out amongst all the other sushi restaurants in Toronto. Sushi was underwhelming as a whole. The shrimp roll in the sushi bento actually tasted kind of off."}
{"text":"3 stars for food, but minus 1 star due to exorbitant hotel pricing.   I was in Vegas with 2 Japanese grandmas who were desperately in need of miso soup and rice. Now normally when in Vegas, I would get my Japanese (or any other Asian for that matter) fix on Spring Mountain Road, but since we were car-less, I figured we'd better stay close by.   Ichiban Sushi is located inside of Bally's, but waaay on the other side of the entrance, near the monorail station. The employees are actually Japanese and I would say the food is more authentic than what you would get at Sushi Roku or Sushi Samba (or many other hotel Japanese restaurants). They have everything from sushi to udon/soba noodles and your typical teriyaki combinations. For us the food was just meh though and overpriced on top of that. I mean really, cucumber salad for $5?? Fried tofu for $7??  Needless to say, I won't be coming back and will instead make the 10 minute drive out off the strip."}
{"text":"Located in Bally's, this place has decent sushi but nothing really to write home about.  Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  Sushi is always good hangover food for me.    Had a rainbow roll, spicy yellowtail roll and some salmon nigiri, all for around 36 dollars.  Little more than what I would expect to pay, but the quality was decent enough.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but at the time it seemed better than Nathan's or Sbarro."}
{"text":"I think this might be the only good food in all of Bally's casino.  Nothing amazing, but at least a decent meal in a casino full of terrible food."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Toronto. The yam & avocado roll is the best I've ever had and the salmon lover roll is divine. I've eaten sushi all over Toronto and I keep coming back to this location for the consistency, low key demeanour and delicious food!"}
{"text":"we were in the mood for sushi after my wifes half marathon in vegas, but the Todai buffet was closed. we accidentally found this place in the bottom of Bally's.   they do serve sushi, but we both had a chill so we opted for 2 of their soba noodle soups. i had the mushroom, the wife had the vegetable. they tasted like any other noodle shop soup....good/fine.   i will say although i was fine with the food, i was surprised at the place itself. it is small....like 6 tables small. however...if your dinner patrons are all of the same ethnicity as the place itself, and the only language being spoken in the restaurant is that ethnicity, i feel like it might be pretty authentic. please don't judge, but based on that, i assume this place might be quite the real deal. alas, my japanese cultural experience is limited to an airport in tokyo, so forgive me.   prices were decent and service was prompt."}
{"text":"When I need a Japanese food fix and I am too lazy to get out and go to Ichiza, I roll here when I am staying at Bally's.  It is located downstairs next to the sports book, tucked away in the back of the casino.  On game day, this place gets very loud, so if you are looking for a quiet place to eat, make sure it is not March Madness or the Super Bowl.  The place is fairly small with counter service for about 12 and about 10 tables.  They could probably put together a group of 8 or so, but I would not recommend attempting this.  The place usually has one or two Japanese speakers if in case that is some sort of necessity here.  It is a bit pricey for the quality of food.  $15 or so for most dinners such as pike mackeral or pork cutlet.  If you want to go cheap, you can get the bowls or eat here for lunch specials.  I have never bothered with their sushi or tempura.  I don't recommend you do so unless you aren't very picky.  Anyhoo, at least they ask whether or not you want your miso soup before the meal or with it.  In case such things are important for you to know, miso soup is supposed to be served with the meal.  Personally, I don't care one way or the other, but it is a good check point for if you are an authenticity nut.  This place is exactly on par with the old Sushi King at the Stardust.  Serviceable when you need Japanese food and some green tea.  And please... if you are trying to impress someone, pick up the phone and call Ichiza and make yourself a reservation instead of eating here."}
{"text":"I suggested we try this place for lunch based on reviews on Yelp, and ended up very happy that we did!  Our server was friendly and more than willing to make suggestions and accommodate special orders. She recommended the Dragon Roll, since I mentioned we were a fan of eel, and it was a great suggestion! Very fresh and well balanced. We also go the spicy yellowtail with avocado, which is one of my favourite rolls. The yellowtail isn't just sitting around in the spicy sauce, the sushi chef makes it fresh when you order it, and it shows. Ample amounts of fish with the perfect amount of avocado, with a decent kick. I think this was my favourite dish. We also got the jalapeno poppers. Beware, these guys will leave their mark! Deep fried jalapenos (seeds still present) stuffed with spicy tuna, drizzled with eel sauce. Holy runny nose, Batman! We actually had to order a side of white rice to help with the heat, and both of us can handle hot foods. These were sooooo spicy, but sooooo good!   Average price for sushi, it was about $50 for the both of us, including tip. Keep in mind that a) it's sushi, b) it's on the Vegas strip. It was a perfect meal in the middle of a ridiculously hot day."}
{"text":"Hidden deep in the underbelly of Bally's hides a nondescript sushi haven.  This is not a see-and-be-seen sushi scene, but the fish is fresh and affordable. It's the type of place where if you ask for low-sodium soy, the server will give you a friendly nod while pretending he doesn't speak English. But if you have people that continually trickling in to join you, they will happily accommodate a table change and pull up a couple extra chairs.  If you want to get away from the glitz and glamour, but not good taste, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Nice fast service, decently priced, food pretty good.  Nice place to get an affordable meal on the strip."}
{"text":"I'm SO glad that we found this place! The sushi was fantastic and the staff was incredibly nice. We got takeout after being lost on the strip and they gave us ice water while we waited. After a short monorail ride back to our hotel, the sushi was still divine. We intend to come here every time we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I mainly frequent Ichiban Sushi for takeout as it's on the way home.  The service is always very good, with my order being ready in ~10 minutes, and now that I've come in there enough they will generally greet me by name, which is a nice touch.  I've eaten at the restaurant once as well and it was also a pretty good experience.  The quality of the sushi is a bit inconsistent - I have had absolutely fantastic sushi a few times with extremely fresh fish, but then have also had sushi where the rice is a bit stale and the fish didn't seem to be as high of quality.  In short, it's generally a pretty solid place with friendly service.  Probably not worth making a long trek here, but if you're in the area it's a good bet."}
{"text":"I've been working odd hours lately, so I took the opportunity to take the girlfriend out for lunch. She led me to Ichiban Sushi and I have to admit, I was really impressed.   It's not the largest restaurant, and therefore treated to the life story of the woman sitting in the booth beside us. Thankfully, the service was extra fast. The server excused himself every time he interupted our conversation, which was unneccassary but a welcome touch.  I got the \"Sushi A\", which is 8 different pieces of sushi with 6 pieces of Maki. This included a miso soup, noodle soup and a salad. All for under $10!   The sushi was excellent. The fish was cut in such a way that it didn't swim around in your mouth like it does when it's cut poorly. The maki was great as well.   As we got up and headed for the door, what seemed like the entire staff said goodbye and wished us a good day. Just a nice final touch to the friendly atmosphere to go with the great food.  Not only did I get some much needed face time in with the girlfriend, but I was treated to an excellent lunch that didn't empty out my pockets. I'll definitely be returning to Ichiban Sushi."}
{"text":"I haven't had a lot of luck with sushi in Ontario... but I have to admit, my standards are exceedingly high; sushi is my favorite food, and I've eaten high quality sushi since I was a teenager (which was a mighty long time ago).  His Goatness and I, taking a weekend to explore a little bit of Toronto, found this place on Yelp, and decided to check it out.  Neighborhood: totally worth the egregious traffic. We really enjoyed sight-seeing along the waterfront, and the neighborhood reminds me a bit of some of my favorite parts of San Francisco -- part of a large city, yes, but still neighborly and friendly and quirky enough to actually have some personality.  Decor: beautiful, cozy, with traditional elements (like all the lovely smooth wood) and semi-private nooks for tables that made the small space very pleasant.  Service: friendly, yes, but hey -- it's Canada, right? That much is a given. While we were surprised and pleased by the complimentary soup, we waited for over 10 minutes for utensils with which to eat it, so it was cold. (As I recall, we actually gave up and swiped utensils off an unused table.) We requested water several times, but never saw any. We were charged for a roll we didn't order (thank god they didn't deliver it; I was stuffed to the gills with their giant portions by the time we left) -- they fixed it, but still.  Food: honest to gods, you need to *warn* people about the size of the portions! I ordered WAY too much fish, and it was painful to finish it (sushi doesn't keep, and I must have starved to death in a past life, as I hate wasting food). Fish was high quality, but be careful ordering: many things on the menu are not sustainable, and/or downright endangered (consult your Seafood Watch guide).  That having been said, this was the best sushi experience I've had yet in Ontario. Fresh seafood is just easier to get on the coast..."}
{"text":"If you've got Vegas overload and want a quiet corner to have some decent Japanese food, go here. Accessible, although IIRC there's no in-restaurant bathroom, just one outside in the casino area (which was accessible).  This place hides in the corner of Bally's basement near the monorail entrance, and manages to achieve something like an oasis of Zen-like calm despite being in the basement of a casino. It is NOT a casino-owned restaurant, so you won't get comped - but you won't be paying prices inflated by comping, either. It isn't huge, so don't bring a huge gang of people, but a medium-size party could fit fine. There's sushi bar seating and tables.   I've been here twice now. Each time, the place was largely full of actual Japanese people, either locals or tourists. Last time, one of the principal dancers from Bally's big show was there with some friends, and obviously liked the place (especially since she could surely get comped elsewhere).   The food is average to good - and that's by my snobby San Francisco Japantown standards. I've had better Japanese in Vegas, for three times the price, but nothing in this range - which is why it gets four stars. Certainly way better than Todai or any of the buffet sushi! The service has always been great, attentive and friendly, tolerant of my sweetie's fumbling Japanese and always ready with more tea."}
{"text":"------------LUNCH ONLY---------- We switched from buffet to here after watching some promo on TV that featured a chef making sushi (so easily swayed, damnt). It's located in Bally's right near the pool. They're undergoing construction so THIS actual location was inside some small conference room nearby.   The price is pretty decent considering it's Vegas. Lunch specials range from $9-13 for your typical entree + salad + miso. It's not the best sushi but it's definitely not the worst. Service was okay. I'd only come here if you have a massive craving for sushi but don't want to pay for quality."}
{"text":"Great sushi with a real Japanese Sushi Chef and Japanese people working there (and eating there so you know it's good). The fish, especially the hamachi and sake, was very fresh- buttery soft and tasty without the fishy taste. Prices are good for being in a casino in vegas. The axillary dining room we were in since they currently have construction going on was definitely weird but the food still came quickly from the kitchen and they put some decorations in to make it look nice."}
{"text":"Solid four stars. Come on, I mean we're talking sushi in the desert. This place is pretty bombtastic. I mean I was here for 4 nights and came here twice!   Their seafood salad - $16.50 for about 7 pieces of fresh sashimi, imitation crab, ebi, tomatoes, avocado, cucumbers, seaweed salad and greens and a ginger miso dressing. Totally healthy and totally yummy!   My absolute favorite: jubilee roll. Take a look at my pictures, soo much fish in that roll! It's delicious!! :) their Agedashi tofu is good too.   Oh also, their green tea is worth mentioning. For some reason their tea seemed extra \"green tea\" enhanced haha.  Waitresses are friendly too!"}
{"text":"Ichiban is my go to sushi place.  Amazing prices, fantastic service, very friendly. I wish there was an Ichiban in every city so I could go to them every day."}
{"text":"Hokay. So, it's in the food court. I went around that thing twice and ended up picking this place, I should have stuck to Hot Dog on a Stick (you can never go wrong with anything on a stick). The sesame chicken was alright, the noodles tasted just plain creepy, they only give you one egg roll (i know  egg rolls don't grow on trees, but common now). I'll exchange my meal  there for a decent meal at Panda Express.  Sianara Ichiban"}
{"text":"I came to Ichiban Sushi with familiarity because I have one near me back home.  It was around lunch time and I wasn't in the mood to spend at lot nor stuff myself silly, so I opted for Ichiban since it was in my hotel (Bally's).  The food isn't really much to brag about, just your usual Japanese Food selections, sushi, donburi, and bento boxes.  I picked up the Chicken Teriyaki on rice.  Considering that during that trip all I've had were buffets, burgers, and sweets, it was a nice change of pace and very welcoming.  I had a very friendly waitress and got my food quick, although there weren't many people in the restaurant at the time.  Next time I stay at Bally's, I will always consider Ichiban an option if I don't want anything too flashy or expensive."}
{"text":"I had lunch here twice and dinner once.   We were looking for something inexpensive and this place fit the bill.   I would have liked some pho but it would involve taking cab rides off the strip.  For lunch, I ordered the teriyaki chicken rice bowl special which came with a salad and miso soup for $8.99.  Dinner was good.... they had very decent maki rolls (try the playboy roll).  I would return."}
{"text":"This is probably a little bit unfair considering I don't actually like Suishi, but I went here with someone who loves it and had compelled me to try something new. I was not moved.  The strip that this particular restaurant sits on is a motley crew of small box stores and Asian restaurants. There are a couple of good Chinese spots, and then there is Ichiban. It wasn't terrible, and I'm quite certain I could just be letting my dislike for seafood cloud how I saw the quality of the food here, but I don't think I am. My dinner partner got a plate of raw Suishi items and loved it, but she's a seafood fan. I got the teriyaki chicken plate. It arrived with a bowl of white rice and a side salad. Salad was a bit watery but decent. White rice was as white rice is, but it was cooked well and no complaints about it. The chicken was where I decided that Ichiban would not be my regular Japanese stop. Dry and fairly watery, it didn't have great flavor and was uninspiring. It was plated with some vegetables that were also somewhat watery.  Service was friendly and the staff were quite cordial, I just think that with the strike against it that I am not a fan of half the menu was too much for it to overcome, even if the chicken had been the best thing since sliced bread.   I wouldn't roll the dice unless raw seafood is your favorite thing"}
{"text":"Tiger roll is spicy, but not to spicy and very yummy  Rainbow roll is yummy too. Service was friendly but a little off, which was odd because they weren't busy at all. I was the only person at the sushi bar at the time. Funny thing was that when I went to put in my sushi order with the sushi chef he acted all weird. Guess they usually have the waitresses take the orders and not the chefs. Just not what I was used to. But they didn't seen to be bothered very much and kept smiling back at me when they walked by.  I will return here due to the quality of food, although the thickness of the cuts of fish wasn't the greatest."}
{"text":"Good stuff!  Went here with my brother and a friend for some good sushi at a reasonable price! That is just what we got!  Friendly service w/ thick accents and plenty of water to detox from all the boozing we'd been doing. One thing I would say is don't get the Philly roll unless u like lots of cream cheese.  The Philly rolls is something I DO normally enjoy but they happen to put a little too much cream cheese in their rolls for my liking.  The Spicy Tuna was -Okay- .  Not great, not bad but just okay.  My brother and friend however ordered delicious rolls that tasted great, and that is what ultimately restored my faith in this place. So despite my regretting my choice of rolls and my brother pointing out \"Damn Mike, everyone got good rolls except you\", Ichiban is a good choice for a casual, economic sushi-venture."}
{"text":"This place is a find!  Its just far enouph away from the stip for the atomosphere to be quite and calm.  It can be found  inside ballys casino by the pool.  The sushi is really good and service was fast.  They also have a secret menu that includes items like the playboy roll and lion roll.  Ask the wait staff about it. Overall delicious with a simple feel."}
{"text":"went during remodeling, not such a good idea, especially while enjoying vegas. didnt know what i was walking into - turned out to be a remodeling hole in the wall. food was ok, nothing spectacular, had just as good back home in la! hopefully if i ever go back to ballys ( where they are located) i can see the new home of ichiban sushi and not the little office space they call the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for both sushi and tempura. It is a small restaurant -- but it has a nice neighbourhood feel. The staff are nice and the food is great.  My hubby ordered sushi/sashimi -- very generous on the fish and not huge on the rice -- looked very fresh -- he said it was delicious. I ordered the Tempura dinner --- and these folks know how to do it right -- it came nice and hot and crispy!  The way tempura should be served.  They give you miso soup, and salad with all meals and it finishes off with a cut up orange.  Nice and juicy and cleanses the palate perfectly after a meal like this.  Check this place out -- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Ordered take out and everything was super fresh.. Close to my apartment and I can't believe I didn't visit sooner. Had the rainbow roll and sashimi as dinner for one on a Saturday night. Came with a salad and miso soup to go, but while I waited they gave me a small appetizer. Super friendly and attentive... Who doesn't love places that make you feel welcomed? I gave it 5 stars because there wasn't anything I felt the need to knock off a star for... Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tasty sushi for takeout or dinein, I bring my friends here every year on my birthday! Super friendly and they'll usually give you a small complimentary something."}
{"text":"I would give this a solid 3.5 stars. We were looking for a place to get a small dinner and came across this while making our way through Ballys/Paris.  We were seated and attended to quickly. Our waitress was really nice, always made sure we had what we needed. We ordered a philly roll, crunch roll, and a couple pieces of octopus. Everything was really good and made well.  Sushi came out quick, but not so quick you are wondering if its fresh. Sapporo's were nice and cold. A nice touch was they brought us a hot cup of green tea at the end of our meal.  I think they may suffer from being in such an odd area. We would definitely come back if we made it that far into Bally's again and were craving sushi."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I ordered take out from here the other day. We got the 25 piece sushi platter and gyoza dumplings. It came with miso soup and salad.  The miso soup is extremely salty and I wasn't a big fan. Their sushi is ok and compared to other nearby takeout places like Kokoro and Oyshi, the quality and size here is really lacking. I've seen bigger 25 piece sushi platters at grocery stores.  Overall, the sushi was average at best and the food is a tad expensive for what you actually get. Their staff is super polite and helpful though."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch last week since Take Sushi on Front closed down earlier this month.   As soon as I walked in, the entire restaurant smelled like fried oil. We were seated quickly but noticed that the surrounding tables haven't been cleared yet.   We both ordered the lunch bento boxes which were reasonably priced for under $10.00. Our miso soup came fast but I wish I could say the same for our bento boxes.   My chicken teriyaki was dry and so flat that they must have pan fried it and kept the spatula on it.   This place is nothing special. Take your money and go to Kirei at Church and Adelaide"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Avocado was hard in the sushi roll NO HO"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and it was delicious every time! Service is a bit slow but it's worth the wait. My favourite roll is the spicy salmon."}
{"text":"This is located inside Bally's.  It's casual dining.  The service was prompt.  The gyoza was probably factory made.  Some of the factory made gyozas are rather good, but not these.  They lacked flavor and were mostly vegetables.  The sushi roll was good as it should be since this is a Japanese run operation.    The chicken teriyaki was overly Americanized with the sauce being much too sweet.  The tempura was good."}
{"text":"Great price for sushi especially for Vegas! I visit this place every time I visit Vegas. The staff is super friendly and it is rarely crowded as it is a hidden jewel in the bottom of ballys :)"}
{"text":"Casual Sushi  Friendly service, nothing ritzy or Vegas about this place just somewhere to eat"}
{"text":"This is our favourite Japanese place in Toronto.  It's a bold statement, but one that we stand by.  Having lived in Japan for 2 years, I can say that this brings back memories of the restaurants there.  The goods: Fish is fresh and tasty Rolls are great with the perfect amount of rice (not too much like many other places) Great staff.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find this place in the basement of Bally's!  It is near the monorail station, next to a Sbarro's!  What a great place to hide a good sushi restaurant!    I only ate edamame, a California roll and tuna sashimi, but both were outstanding.  The ambiance is nothing special, as you might expect, but the quality of the food made up for it.  Arigato Ichiban!"}
{"text":"We've had Ichiban sushi a few times and it's delicious.  Recommend it. :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. It is not an upscale fancy place, but your typical sushi setting type. but it has by far the best quality food~  Two things you must try!!!!!  1. ANYTHING with EEL on it.  Caterpiller/dragon.  For some reason, this place serves the best eel on it.  They make it extra soft, and extra hott!  it is by far the best eel I have ever tasted it. you would think how can an eel taste good. but this is mind blowing!  2. Spicy scallop handroll!! or spicy scallop nigri (2 pieces with rice)? Hotegai is scallop. Their spicy scallop is mind blogging!!!it is perfection. the sauce is to die for!! not any typical sauce!!   If you must get other stuff, do so at ease.  You must try their top two!!!! The server asked us if we wanted their house speciality that day \"toro\" fatty tuna.  They didnt really trick us, but they did.  We didn't know each piece was 20/ and we got 2.  For two pieces of sashimi!  But me and my boyfriend come here with every visit to LV"}
{"text":"Right now their real location is under construction, as several other reviewers mentioned. Their current spot is in a cozy little conference room, which certainly lacks the flair that a lot of places on the Strip have. But...! (You should have seen that coming...) But, the service is amazing. Chika was our utterly adorable and funny waitress, when the staff graciously let our group of six in close to closing. All but one of us were stunned by the quality of the sushi rolls in the basement of Bally's, tucked away in a conference room by the pool. It was our last night, but I regret not trying their bento lunch specials. It was a quite, perhaps unexpected atmosphere, but entirely enjoyable. I will have to go back next time I am there."}
{"text":"Stepped in with the plan to tak-out. This restaurant made me want to stay and dine in. The atmosphe re is great and I was surprised to see the interior japanese themed (*I'm from America --most  cuisines that are cheap don't go all out in their interior design).  Anyway I stepped in feeling welcomed, the music was pop and we recieved complementary food as we waited. It tasted great. The sushi and udon that we took home was great and fresh tasting as well. ^_^"}
{"text":"Located right down by the Harbour Front, I'm surprised this place isn't busier every time I go. It's a hidden gem! It's good value sushi and the restaurant has a nice and quiet atmosphere, something I've come to expect at all sushi restaurants.   I generally always order the maki rolls and this place has a pretty good selection of rolls which are well made. The rice isn't over cooked and the rolls do not fall apart when picked up!   This place does take out, but I recommend just sitting down to eat there because from my experience the rolls are always better in the restaurant.   Next time your down at the Harbour Front and looking for a quick and reasonably prices meal I definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Was deciding which one to walk in to... Ichiban or next door Nathan's.  After 5 minutes of observing each location, decided to go a bit healthy.  Food quality is fine (don't know about seafood based sushi/meals).  Service took longer than \"normal\".  So on the second day, I ordered simple dish to go from both here and Nathan's.  I got food ready from Nathan's in 6 min.  From Ichiban....  17 min. For service quality(speed of meal preparation), I give 2 stars but food quality compensates (being nice here I am....) as well as staff member being apologetic for slow kitchen service (it's not their fault) so 3 stars.   I think the chef is taking too much time to perfect the dish.... anyways... I enjoyed the taste of meal."}
{"text":"Nice quality tuna excellent use of sesame seed on the sushi roll positive experience tried the jalapeno bomber hotttt!"}
{"text":"The Chriashi sushi bowl was excellent, the fish was really really smooth and perfectly cut. I would definitely get it again!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is nothing fancy but it's fresh, reasonably priced, and always tasty. Whenever I eat in or get takeout here, the service is fantastic. They are super friendly and usually give you a free soup and extra small item. The decor is cute too. The entire restaurant has good vibes!"}
{"text":"Great for a sushi fix at a reasonable price.  Nothing fancy, but who needs fancy when Vegas is exploding with fancy everywhere else."}
{"text":"This is a tough one to write...but let's have a go.  Sushi: Excellent.  Service: Absolute Crap.  In town for a convention, staying at Bally's.   We went twice, packed evening for dinner = slow & crappy, crappy service. Next day for lunch (fairly empty, so hopeful, but) = slow & crappy, crappy service.  At the lunch service, two of my dining companions didn't get their salads & soups with the Lunch combos they ordered.  I tried to step up for the ladies (twice) and was summarily dismissed (twice)  OK - I had it at 2 stars, but after this writing, dropped it to one.  Restaurants provide a SERVICE.  I'm happy to pay for what I want, and in this country, it means paying the servers as well (since \"wage\" in American restaurants is like $2.70/hr).  I get it.  So I pay. (Before you start in on me, Yes: I have worked as a server myself.) If I don't enjoy the overall experience, I won't remember the food as nicely as I'd like.  That's all..."}
{"text":"Probably the best (and perhaps only) \"no frills\" Japanese restaurant you can find on The Strip. By the time you're reading this they might have already moved into their renovated location (exciting!), but if not they're still temporarily in a converted conference room at the end of the corridor leading to the monorail/pool underneath Bally's. This works in your favor for now, since it keeps it less well-known, out of sight and therefore rarely busy. Great for a quiet late lunch/dinner, or take out.  I would compare the quality of the food to that of a good Japanese restaurant in the Bay Area, for those of you familiar, but with slightly higher prices (combination dinner + a roll is about $30) since it is, after all, on The Strip.  What I usually get: - Combination lunch/dinner. Salad comes with miso dressing. Tempura is fried just right. Teriyaki chicken is crispy, not drenched in sauce. Portions are slightly smaller than what you'd expect, but everything is done well. If you order to-go they include the miso soup. - A roll. Standard sized, a couple of dollars more than average ($13 - $17 instead of $10 - $13).  The (very friendly) staff are actually Japanese and speak Japanese to each other, if that matters. When I order for take out they bring me water or tea in a portable cup while I wait, which is a very nice touch."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here because we were already in Bally's and didn't want to walk around searching for a sushi place to satisfy our craving. Walked up to the joint and you can tell it's small. There was a menu in the front and my husband pointed out the sushi boat and because we always want to eat a sushi boat at every restaurant we go to, we decided to go here. My friends never tried a sushi boat so they got one too. I was EXTREMELY dissapointed in the sushi love boat. It only had a roll of spicy tuna which was four pieces and a couple of nigiri (3 to be exact) and 4 pieces of sashimi which were the size of two of my fingers and I have small fingers. Then they gave us a couple of dumplings, slice of steak, two shrimp tempura and couple of vegetable tempura. The love boat which is suppose to feed two people could have just fed me alone and I would still be hungry. The love boat costs get this $55! NOT WORTH IT. Go elsewhere if you're in the mood for sushi. The only good thing here is the service. The waitress was very friendly to my friend. She was treated like she was the daughter or relative."}
{"text":"Beware: remodeling is still ongoing as of May 2013. The interim location is down the escalators and then keep right. That location is clearly a 1-Star environment, but we did not mind too much and enjoyed that we did not have to wait to be seated at 8 pm. Food is 4 star: we had rainbow rolls and nigiris. The salmon nigiri was 5 stars, however, the rest was 4 when comparing to our favorite Seafood-Restaurant at home.  Prices are okay, probably Las Vegas standard. Rainbow roll was $16.  So as long as you set your expectations right with respect to the location, you should be fine."}
{"text":"Located on the mall level of Bally's hotel, Ichiban Sushi was really quite good for a little non-descript restaurant. The chef (at time of visit) was from Hawaii so he made some killer poki for us (including friends from the island). The sashimi was really fresh and the a la carte items were also very very tasty. We ended up eating there 2x out of a 4 day stay so that's saying something."}
{"text":"Being away from home, Hawaii, traveling to the mainland for a long period of time is difficult because we love our rice!! Which is why I'm sooo glad my husband and I found this place by accident back in 2009. Every time we come to Vegas, which is pretty often, we have to come here at least once during our trip! The price is decent for what you get and we have been lucky to get seated with the same waitress every single time! She's wonderful and remembers us every time we go. We just got back several weeks ago and will be returning there after our Japan trip!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Sushi was excellent, fresh and tasty. Service was also prompt and friendly. In Bally's basement near Monorail."}
{"text":"It was a random Tuesday, my friends and I took a spontaneous road trip to Las Vegas. I was browsing at a magazine in the Hooter's Hotel on the July 2010 issue of \"The Complete Guide to go Where: Las Vegas,\" (wheretraveler.com). As i was browsing this small description under the \"The Guide: Dining\" on ICHIBAN SUSHI  in BALLY'S stated: A rotating sushi bar presents selections that gently glide by your chopsticks. WRONG; FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!  My friends and I went into this sushi bar thinking there was going to be an actual rotating sushi bar. We thought wrong. The restaurant was a little small, no doubt there used to be a rotating sushi bar. I honestly thought it was hidden somewhere. I asked the waitress what happened to the \"rotating sushi bar\" and she said that \"WE USED TO HAVE IT BEFORE WHEN WE FIRST OPEN.\" Now, how long ago was that? She claimed that it was \"HARD TO MAINTAIN.\" Explain why it was on the most recent July '10 issue? This seriously was a bummer, we expected one thing and got another.  This regularly priced sushi joint wasn't bad, it was actually okay. I ordered Spicy Yellowtail and Spicy Mini Scallop cut roll. It was pretty good, i enjoyed the sriracha (rooster sauce) in the little mix with the raw fish. Oh man that was tasty. We also ordered Shrimp Tempura with Udon Noodles. This dish took quite some time to serve. The shrimp tempura was small, I've seen a larger tempura at \"Mako in Los Feliz, CA.\" Overall, my experience was okay, this place is marginal. There are better sushi joints out there were you can get the full experience of a rotating sushi bar."}
{"text":"\"Yay no sleeepie all gamblie\"  \"This is tuna and this is crabstick\"  \"no probrem\"  I thought ichiban meant number 1. They remind you at the door. As a complimentary service they have an illiterate lady from hong kong constantly translating ichiban.   If you didn't know that the country of japan is the origin of any type of cuisine, this place is for you. In fact, if you have no idea what Japanese food is then your ignorance will be bliss.  Subpar food, service is poor. May be an illegal front for Chinese immigrant racket. Bottom line: if you were thinking sbarros, do sbarros."}
{"text":"Ichiban Sushi is a comfortable casual place in the rear of Bally's on the way to the monorail station. I found this place 5 years ago while attending a trade show. I decided to try Ichiban as I noticed that most of the patrons visiting that week were Japanese nationals away from home wanting Japanese cooking. I have dinner here at least twice for my once a year visit while I'm in Vegas for the week. Ichiban is perfect after spending a whole day on the convention floor. The atmosphere is lively but tame enough  to have a conversation should you wish to have friends join you for dinner.   I found that I liked Ichiban because of the variety of ala-carte items, and many items that you won't find in the high priced/high end sushi places that are plentyful in Las Vegas. The appetizer list is long so you won't run out of items to try. I rate the sushi as good, but not in the high end of excellent. Don't get me wrong, the sushi is still very tasty, fresh, and delicious.   I ordered everything ala-carte, starting with sake and a beer chaser. Meanwhile an order of sushi consisting of, mackerel, tuna, unagi, and halibut await. The sushi order took longer than expected, so don't be in a hurry if you order sushi. There are two chefs handling all of the sushi orders. As an appetizer I ordered nato tofu or hiyayako tofu. On one night I had chicken udon and the next night I had broiled black cod and some pickled vegetables. Both items came with miso soup which was excellent. The oyako domburi is also good dish to order. All dinners finished with green tea.   I feel that many of the dishes served can be described as Japanese comfort food; overall a delicious and satisfying experience. Both waitresses Pen and Midori were very attentive, personable, and took care of my dining needs. Ichiban is open on some nights until 11:00PM which is great since I like to eat late after 9:00 PM."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices!! Yelp helped us find Ichiban, which is on the lowest level (basement) of Bally's. I had the lunch special with teryaki chicken and tempura shrimp and veggies, which came with miso soup and a side salad. It was super yummy, and quite a bit of food for only $10!  My boyfriend had two sushi rolls - spicy tuna and spicy yellow tail. Both were priced around $8. I am not a huge fan of the raw fish sushi, but the yellow tail was INCREDIBLE! Very fresh and flavorful without that \"fish\" flavor. I highly recommend Ichiban if you are in Vegas and craving Japanese/sushi! :)"}
{"text":"Ichiban Sushi is one of my local go-to spots for take out. My typical order includes the Spicy Salmon Roll, Rainbow Roll, Dynamite Roll and the Kame Sashimi Combo. The Kame Sashimi Combo usually comes with a mix of sashimi, but I always order it with all salmon (since I'm a salmon lover!) and it usually comes with a miso soup and salad, but I always order with 2 miso soups and no salad. They are always accommodating with my requests and give you extra ginger if you ask (I'm also a ginger lover!). The sashimi is always super fresh and I the rolls are delicious."}
{"text":"I tried this place after an exhausting day - I went into ichiban with 3 friends and they had a 4 out of 5 stars. I was very hungry and ordered a tempura udon. The ones I had back in Vancouver were delicious. We waited for an hour for our food !!! There wasn't that many people in the resultant, in fact we were the only 2 table. We came before 8 and got our food at 9.   The glass was dirty on the bottom. I guess I don't mind but it's not a pleasant view to see when you can see it from the top of the cup. That was a big turn off.    The tempura udon was just sad (please see photo). It was 1/4 of salty soup and the udon was not al dente. I was hungry so it was my only option. Will not return."}
{"text":"Traveling through Toronto I happened upon this restaurant via a local food site.  The staff friendly, the fish as fresh as I have had in a while, the portions GIANT.  Needless to say I ordered far too much but enjoyed it immensely.  It comes with nice little add-ons like a soup and a tofu pastry and a half orange for dessert.  Its all that much better since its unexpected and I rarely see other sushi houses do this.  If you are anywhere near The Beach neighborhood you owe it to yourself to stop in here."}
{"text":"Spicy tuna and spicy salmon is the hottest I have ever had. Too hot! Liked this place though, and the prices were right!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Japanese food for a great price too.  I have to go to this restaurant when I go to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Had great sushi here on my last night in Vegas!  I was staying at Bally's Hotel / Casino, and after I checked out I had to kill some time before getting my shuttle to the airport.  My dinner was delicious, and of course the wine was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Okay i usually eat here when i go to vegas when i stay at the Paris Casino.  1. sushi is very fresh 2. service is good 3. Everything that ive tried has been fresh and tasty. 4. ive had the lunch bento its very good and filling. 5. my favs are rainbow roll, futomaki, spicy scallop roll,  their nigiri is good also.  6. My only complaint and they would get five stars is the price, it's pricey i guess rent on a strip casino is not cheap.  Its runs me about $50 which includes tip for myself when i go eat sushi here.  If your gonna eat at the strip for sushi i do recommend Ichiban"}
{"text":"Japanese style breakfast. I don't know if other place serve like this in vegas.  Salmon, sweet egg, Nori, Kombu and miso soup.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Great affordable sushi place on the Vegas strip without the $$$$ prices. This sushi restaurant is located in the basement of Ballys Hotel just next to Sbarros and the Sports book and some mall like kiosks. So this place isn't well known since it's away from the foot traffic but you get some excellent quality sushi but don't expect the atmosphere and decor to be like Blue Ribbon Sushi in the Cosmopolitan or Japonis at the Mirage."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and cool environment, but the sushi was absolutely terrible. The rice was stiff and old, the yam tempura in my roll tasted like it was made days ago, the salmon in my salmon maki smelled way too fishy and had hard pieces in it. And way over priced for the quality. Terrible across the board."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit. We ordered the sushi platter, comes with soup and salad. The salad was a soggy mess, the soup was fine.  The tea was lukewarm.  It's OK, we came for the sushi.  The sushi was terrible.  Our set included approximately 16 pieces of sushi, 8 California rolls (more or less)  The salmon and tuna was OK.  Not terrific.  The squid, California rolls and shrimp were dry, stale, and not edible.  We had an event to go to at the ACC and didn't want to reorder.  We only ate the tuna and the salmon.  We told the waitress that the rest of it was not good, the fish was dry and not fit for consumption.  She offered an insincere apology, making no offers to remedy the situation.  I  If your customers leave refusing to eat your food, I would be worried.  Apparently the staff here doesn't think so.  We will definitely not be visiting this restaurant again.  I advise you to think twice as well."}
{"text":"Service is slow, sushi itself was nothing special. The chirashi was served with cold rice."}
{"text":"Nice people and great food for while at the sports book.   Quality Sushi at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Three stars means A-OK and that's what this place is, OK. Not bad, not awesome, but halfway decent.   I have to say that the service is very good. They're really friendly here and bend over backwards to make sure you are happy. It's a pretty small place but clean and comfortable with the fun lobster tank outside.  We basically came here because it was close by to the hotel and it was relatively cheap. There is certainly much better sushi to be had in Vegas and there is certainly much better AND more expensive sushi to be had. We wanted to keep things easy and cheap.   They have a good selection and all the usual suspects are present. Didn't see any particularly unusual or creative things on the menu but you've got your spicy tuna, salmon skin, rainbow rolls and all the rest. The fish was pretty fresh and it was presently nicely but it just lacked a \"Wow this is so delicious\" factor. Salmon skin was a little fishy and the spicy tuna a little chewy and not as spicy as I would like.   I do think it's an OK value if you are lazy and cheap and in the area but I wouldn't make any specific plans on coming here as it wasn't that good. Next time I would probably make the effort to go somewhere with better quality food for similar prices (even if it means not being so lazy and actually getting into a cab)."}
{"text":"The hostess is always friendly and remembers me and my order even though I've only been there a handful of times. The sashimi is fantastic and they always put in a bit extra when I order takeout. Love this place!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem?  Perhaps.   I expect good food in vegas but all the fancy places were 2hr wait.  Found ichiban in the basement of ballys.  Tamago was excellent Salmon and a few rolls great . Then I had some perfect Uni. Then we tried a wonderful gindara (cod) Finally I was treated to some of the best hamachi belly ever.   I am a sushi snob and I will be back."}
{"text":"When I'm in Vegas and just want straightforward sushi for lunch, I usually go here by default.  It's pretty out of the way, in the down the escalator basement area of Bally's hotel near the sportsbook.  Pretty uninviting actually, you have to walk through this 80's like mall area where they sell these cheap globes and souvenir stores, past the Sbarro pizza next to the sportsbook until you finally get to the entrance. The reason I keep coming back even though I never stay at Bally's is because it's decent food and the other strip sushi place, Hamada Sushi of Japan, doesn't sell sushi during the daytime for some reason.   I usually order their assorted lunch sushi special, which is 5 pieces of sushi (salmon, tuna, yellow tail, shrimp, tamago (the egg omelet sushi), and a california roll for $12.95. Really good bargain, and I really like their onigiri rice balls too.  Service is super friendly and they're always checking on me no matter how busy they are which I really appreciate.  It's a great place for sushi, and I don't feel like I'm in Vegas when I eat here."}
{"text":"Decent sushi. Not amazing wow sushi but good and fresh. Nice server. Environment is down and dirty one star. Not much cheaper if at all cheaper than Ra which is much better food. If I ever find myself in the basement of Harrah I might stop in again but its not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"The service was friendly at the front and with our server, but this sushi bar in the basement of Bally's is just a bit disappointing. The menu isn't imaginative, and the classics just don't taste great. Speaking of the menu, the plastic-coated menus have item after item and price after price crossed off in Sharpie, and when I'm spending $60-70 on lunch, that just isn't good enough."}
{"text":"Somehow there's super fresh and delicious sushi in Bally's basement. Okay, not the basement but the bottom floor where the pool is... and the Sbarro.   A huge group of friends and I ate here while taking a break from our fab cabanas. It was perfect. Refreshing and tasty. The prices are about right for a small place like this in Vegas, but the service is totally flawless. Our waitress was so accommodating and sweet and never once seemed flustered at our multiple demands and checks.   I like their menu, it's very authentic with its a la carte items (which caters surprisingly well to vegetarians and vegans). They also have tons of fun creative rolls.   This place is definitely a diamond in the rough and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Restaurant didn' seem complete but the quality of the sushi was great! We ordered the Vegas roll, Unagi Roll, California Roll, Eel Sushi, and tuna sushi.They messed up on our order but made up for it by giving us extra sushi. Wait staff was nice and I would definately come back here next time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Just ate at the location, and I am now not feeling so well. The tuna smelt off, maybe the fish isn't as good because they are not getting the clientele they have had previously. I wouldn't be going back anytime soon!!!"}
