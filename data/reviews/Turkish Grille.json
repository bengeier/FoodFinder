{"text":"I went in not expecting much, but Turkish Grille blew me away. I got the Chicken Kabab plate and it was delicious. The Chicken was perfectly cooked with a nice char on the outside, but still juicy on the inside."}
{"text":"We just discovered Turkish Grill in the Oakland area.  They offer rich variety of Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisine.  The food quality and service was fantastic !!! .  I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Turkish restaurant in Pittsburgh and that means a lot coming from a girl who is middle eastern and knows a lot about middle eastern food. I probably order from here at least once a week. I always order the haydari for appetizer and chicken shish kabob for dinner. The haydari is AMAZING. Even my 2 year old son loves it. It comes with delicious soft bread. The chicken is cooked to perfection in cubes. I always order my chicken well done since they come in huge cubes and I know it's hard to cook 100% inside being that big and thick. The chicken kabob comes with rice that is buttery and so so good and a garnish salad that is very good & refreshing. Try this place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"It was my first time to visit this place and it was amazing. We started with humus and salad which was amazing and  then we got adana kebab that was so juicy and cooked perfect. We later had kunefe .. i never thought cheese and though would be this amazing. Our server hami was friendly and helpful he was always smiling.

After all this was far beyond great experienece for me. 

Thanks Turkish grille"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I highly recommend it. Iskender and the kebabs were tasty. For an appetizer I recommend sigara borek, and for dessert we had kazandibi. As a native of Turkey, I can verify this food is authentic- perhaps even as good as my mother's. 

The service was impeccable- they were flexible with our orders and allowed us to combine parts of two entrees into one.

This is a must-go restaurant if you are in Oakland."}
{"text":"It is amazing!! Highly recommended! I usually don't like salad but their Salad is great! Shush kebab is very tender!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and added it to my top 5 favorite restaurants. Got the haydari as appetizer and split the mixed platter with a friend and rice pudding for dessert. All were amazing. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I splurged on the Turkish Mixed Grille and was rewarded with a variety of sophisticated flavors.  And the Kunefe was a unique, not-too-sweet dessert treat!  Two big wins equals a five star review.  The pita was very good, the appetizers solid, delivery reliable."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Had the mixed grill plate and an appetizer which was enough for two people. The meat was fresh, tender, and very flavorful. The waiter was very nice. Interior decor has a calming and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing!! An unexpected delight. The pride Turkish Grille takes in their craft wafts out of every dish. Staying at a nearby hotel, we wanted something other than the standard fare. A little research turned up the Turkish Grille. We ordered the mixed cold appetizer and the Turkish mixed grille entree. The food arrived earlier than expected, delivered with a smile. We opened it in the midst of a conversation and absentmindedly started to eat. The conversation stopped. All we could do was eat and talk about the food. Thank you for making such an unexpectedly wonderful night!"}
{"text":"This wonderful little restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but it has a good heart and good food. We were greeted by Selim on a frigid night and choose a table in the nearly empty restaurant. Between us, we shared an appetizer mix, a lamb kebab, and chicken adana kebab plate. The food was delicious and reasonably priced.

During the meal, a man dining alone at the next table tried several times to introduce himself into our conversation and eventually came over to ask to join us. We begged off but the encounter was quite strange so we got tuned into his table. At the end of his meal, the man dashed rather than paying. We were shocked but Selim took it in stride. When I asked about it, I learned that there had been signs that problems were afoot. I was so impressed that Selim and the restaurant were so mellow in the way they handled this apparently troubled man. I offered to pay his bill but Selim wouldn't let me. There was something so gracious and kind in the way this was handled. Hence my review: Good heart. Good food."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Mediterranean foods in Pittsburgh! I highly recommend the zucchini pancakes. At first, I was annoyed that they had a $25 min delivery, but I ordered a main course and two appetizers, and I am so glad that I was able to try all three!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have lived in the area for the past 3 years and have always wanted to find great authentic Turkish food. This place exceeded our expectations! Food is delicious, and each dish comes with rice, salata, pickled cabbage, and multiple sauces! The inside of the restaurant is beautiful and the people are very nice. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"its new Mediterranean restaurant in Oakland area, under new ownership it seems like alot of things has changed. menu, food quality, service. they have cute outside seating. Doner is so fresh, iskender is so good.. like better taste than many restaurants in turkey I swear! Chef at turkish grill is just great! Its gonna be our favorite spot with no doubt. Make sure you try some turkish desserts and coffee before u step out, you wont regret!"}
{"text":"This place was super delicious!!! I had the chicken doner and my friend had the lamb shish kebab. The meals were served with freshly toasted pita bread. I asked for the traditional yogurt sauce (I forgot the name) and they gave me a big side of it for no extra cost. The chicken was well seasoned and very soft and crispy on the edges. I got the Turkish pasta on the side instead of the rice and the noodles were very soft but the sauce didn't have much flavor but was still pretty good. I was definitely stuffed afterwards!!! This place is very cute and cozy for a nice date night too"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I normally love Mediterranean style food and and we noticed this place open right on our street. We decided to give it a try! As soon as we walked in, we noticed how beautiful it was and how much work the owners put into it. It's extremely clean and uniquely decorated. It's casual but still a very inviting atmosphere. The staff is so polite and friendly and offered us Turkish tea right away while we figured out what we wanted to order. We ordered 2 lamb gyro wraps and fries to share. The food came really fast along with two sauces (1 spicy and 1 cool cucumber) for no extra charge! The wraps were super big, especially for how cheap ($8)!! The meat was so amazing and you can tell how it rested on a spit for hours, cooked authentically. All the veggies and herbs in the wrap were so fresh and everything was perfect together with the sauces drizzled in. The fries were only $3 and could easily be shared between 2-4 people as a side. They were really crunchy but soft on the inside, like diner French fries. The complimentary Turkish tea was yummy to have with the meal and added to the experience. This place far exceeded our expectations in all aspects. These people have put in a lot of work to create an awesome experience and they're doing it. We highly recommend Turkish Grill for anyone who wants a quick bite of amazing quality food for cheap in a wonderful environment!"}
{"text":"Ok seriously the best turkish food in Pittsburgh hands down! It's like real authentic turkish food sooo many options - meals and appetizers!!!!! The service was out of this world too quick and super friendly and attentive!!!! The atmosphere is very nice as well!! Overall really great experience. 100% will be going again !!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and surprisingly good service for a Monday night with only one server working the front. My party of 3 ordered baba ghanoush and spinach cigarette borek to start, both yummy, which came with warm pita bread. I had the Turkish tea and chicken doner kebab plate, which was huge and delicious. The rice pudding for dessert was smooth and just the right amount of sweet. Strongly recommend for dining in, and I also plan to make it a regular for takeout."}
{"text":"There is no better pita and hummus in the city! The best I have ever had. Their portions are huge, and the quality of food is delightful. You can tell they cook with fresh ingredients. My favorite take-out joint in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Visited here yesterday, love the place and the food. Before that read some guest's negative judgement and worried about that. But the food turned out excellent!"}
{"text":"Since its opening in our neighborhood, today was the first day we checked it out, and I'm glad we did. We weren't super hungry, so we ordered one hummus (which comes with 2 soft pita) and a shish kabab wrap. Both were excellent. I loved the spicy garnish the kabab had. Bolstered by the initial performance, we ordered baklava, which was also charming. Don't forget the complimentary Turkish tea. 

Overall: great at a very modest price. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE TURKISH FOOD IN THE TOWN,Especially their deserts mouthwatering and lovely atmosphere.Thank you for the hospitality and good food."}
{"text":"Best turkish food in Pittsburgh. I have visited them twice and both tines they have provided us great food and quality service."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Food and service is very good. Sercan is a very good waiter. Nice people. Highly recommended. Appetizers and lamb dishes are very good. Byob. Will have some outdoor seating. Have liked everything we have had. Very good desserts."}
{"text":"Oh my!!!!! I order online the grilled lamb, hummus, pita and desert!!! 
Just beautiful and tasty. 
Good balance of flavors!!! 
Just add a little bit of salt to the hummus but my love it just as it (most of the hummus that you find around have too much lemon) the lamb was tender and not dry at all; on the side I have almond rice and a fresh salad with a creamy dressing... and my son love everything"}
{"text":"Authentic! 
The Kezme is full of Turkish flavor and spices with a right amount of heat
Their Kunefe dessert is one of the best I've ever had! 
Very friendly family owned atmosphere 
Beautifully decorated with colorful tile hangings 
A few tables for outdoor seating
Will b back to try more authentic dishes!"}
{"text":"Loved their food! It's probably the best Turkish I have had in Pittsburgh! The kabobs were very flavorful and juicy! I loved their gyro it's very different and full of flavor! The servers were really nice and welcoming. We were 10 people and a high chair. As we all know chaotic we ten people try to order but they had all the orders pinned down. Their customer service was amazing some of our friends wanted the makarna (Turkish spaghetti) and they were out of it so they gave us two huge plates of French fries and desserts which was the brown topped rice pudding. I am telling you if you ever visit this place do not leave with out having the brown topped rice pudding. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Very confused by all of the stellar reviews for this place. Maybe people in Pittsburgh aren't used to good Mediterranean food, but we did not like the food from here. 

As for the gyro wraps, they were stuffed with lots of meat, but the sandwich was not very flavorful at all. The sandwiches were also inconsistent -- we ordered two, and one was super greasy and the other too dry. The hummus was ok. Not the best I've had, but not the worst. I prefer my hummus to be a little more smooth. The pita it came with was soggy (although it was delivery so I am sure there are challenges with preventing that). 


The fried feta roll up sticks were also only ok. 

Would not recommend this place. There are better options for Mediterranean food in the city."}
{"text":"The best Iskender Kebab I have ever had!!!! Beautiful customer service, Kazandibi is die for. Peaceful ambience. You must try this place you won't regret."}
{"text":"Turkish Grille always provides a consistent dinner with great marinades and spices with a soothing atmosphere and its smooth but upbeat music and cool art on the walls. The lamb, chicken, and veggie kabobs are tasty, the rice is of high quality and the pitas always contribute the carb tastes we all love. The complementary wine from signing in from Yelp is awesome! The only downside is sometimes there isn't as much meat that you would expect for its price. The quality is top notch, but when it doesn't fill the plate or your belly we are sometimes left wanting just a bit more~"}
{"text":"I apparently have a different opinion here, but I think this food is just okay. It's edible! But lacking in flavor, unless that flavor is too much vinegar and too much dill. The service is really slow. It's a smaller restaurant with cafe style tables. There were 2 other tables and a larger party of roughly 8 people when we walked in. When we ordered, he didn't write anything down, which always makes me nervous. I ordered falafel, a salad with dressing on the side and grape leaves. He was confused as I was ordering which worried me even more. It took a very long time for the food to come out after the appetizers, and mine came out incorrectly. There was a ton of vinegar all over my salad. I sent it back and told them I didn't want it replaced. It took over 30 minutes for them to come check on me in order for me to actually send it back though. 

The falafel was good. It wasn't hard or dry or too nutty. The grape leaves were very strong tasting, probably too much so. We ordered baklava, which was decent. One waiter brought out an extra dessert to make up for the salad which was nice and pretty tasty. It was milk pudding with cinnamon on top. However, it then took at least 20 more minutes afterwards and they still hadn't given us our check. We waived our credit card and he just took it so we didn't even know how much it was. 

Over all, a weird experience. Definitely not close to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick, but food was not good. My vegetable kebab was so greasy I did not eat it, and my partner got food poisoning after eating the lamb kebab. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food. It's not cheap but it's not crazy expensive either. the atmospherep  inside is very comfortable and appropriate for the vibe. The Falafel is amazing for $7 highly recommended. I also got a chicken and a dish called chicken Donner and I would prefer the more seasoning on the chicken personally but for most people I think it would be good I had like heavy spices. Everything was excellent and my waiter was very nice everybody there was very nice it's a small place. Probably would recommend reservations on a Friday or Saturday evening this place to eat is very unique I'm looking forward to coming back and trying their Gyros and other fare on their menu. Also it's located only one block away from my other favorite ethnic restaurant in Pittsburgh, Tamarind"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic (I visited with my Turkish friend) Turkish food!

We shared the babaganoush which was delicious! Note that, unlike other babaganoush that I've had, it had dill in it. 

I had the adana and shish kebap. Both were very tasty. I opted for the adana because in my experience it is more consistent than the shish, but I would definitely be back for the shish. It was so tender! Both meats were seasoned really well. The main dishes came with rice and a really tasty salad. The online menu says that it would also come with grilled tomato and pepper, but it didn't. It also says you can choose rice or makarna. I may ask for the makarna next time because I am not a huge rice (pilaf-style) person.  

I think the price was extremely fair for the quality and portion. I will definitely be back and may try ordering online as well!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing to begin with. The interior design of the restaurant is amazing it is very aesthetically pleasing and adds to the food. The food is also very nicely presented for a decent price. I would totally recommend this place for anyone that wants high quality food."}
{"text":"This place is so good I almost don't want to tell people about my hidden gem for fear it might get super busy! We tried a lamb Adana wrap and the platter that has a little of everything. It was so delicious and the people were so friendly. Highly recommended. Update: they no longer give the free bread and dip for appetizer :("}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a saturday night. Ordered falafel and hummus for starters and veggie platter for main course, followed by baklava for desert :). Each and every item was fresh and amazing in taste. Haven't tasted more soft and fresh falafel anywhere else before!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch while we were visiting Pittsburgh for the day! We were greeted by Selim who was super friendly and patient and answered any questions we had.
We each ordered a bowl of lentil soup and shared the Turkish Grille Mixed to sample a bit of everything.
The lentil soup was flavored well and it came with a slice of lemon that added a nice zing.
The Turkish Grille Mixed came with lamb kebab, a lamb chop, chicken Adana, kofte, tomato salad, and rice with little short noodles in it. It's also supposed to come with doner kebab but it wasn't ready when we ordered(~11am) so Selim let us substitute it with lamb Adana. I just realized that he added some chicken kebab as well! Everything in that dish was cooked well, flavorful and had just the right amount of char to it. The tomato salad was a bit on the salty side but other than that, it was a great dish!
I love bread and I was excited that our meal came with fresh pita bread! It had the perfect amount of fluff and just the slightest char on the outside that added a good texture.

I highly recommend this place if you want a great and filling Turkish meal! I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"How can I start the review, first of all, inside looks amazing also all foods are very good. High recommend ! 
My favorite \"Mersin Tantuni\" what's yours ?"}
{"text":"Fantastic local spot. Had the chicken kebab - cheap, fresh, delicious, healthy! Took me right back to Istanbul. Service was great as well and they even had Turkish style tea cups. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We loved everything we ordered! A plate with assorted cold dips (+ warm pita), lamb shish, falafel and zucchini platter. We didn't realize the entrees came with rice so we ended up with more food than we could finish. Even the house salad was good. Would definitely visit again. We were the only ones in the restaurant, maybe it was just the timing, not sure why. More people should visit the Turkish Grille!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little place in Oakland! I'm always nervous about picking places in Oakland, I don't want to be surrounded by loud colleges kids. Luckily, this place is like a hidden gem. The restaurant itself is not very large, but it feels cozy and the decor is beautiful. The staff is very attentive and the food is incredible. I could literally eat pounds of just their rice! I got the chicken shish kebab and it was awesome. I will certainly be back for more!"}
{"text":"My favorite Turkish place in Pittsburgh. I've been there hundred times after the moment I found out it was reopened with the new management and new cooks. So now I finally decided to write a review because my feelings to this place can no longer stay untold.

When I dine in a Turkish restaurant, I always get lamb shish kebab, it has become a tradition to me. Having tried all the shish kebabs in Pittsburgh, I can say for sure that the best one is at Turkish Grille. Tender, soft, flavorful, outstanding (!!!). I also love their shrimp kebab which comes with a tasty sauce perfect for seafood. And most of the meals come with the side of rice and delicious fresh salad.

Have to mention brilliant deserts. My favorites are kazandibi (milk pudding) and kunefe (shredded wheat with mozzarella cheese and syrup). That feeling when you get a desert and a cup of Turkish tea... or a small espresso-like Turkish coffee. 

One more feature of this place is quick and friendly service. Very pleasant guys who make you smile and feel comfortable like you're home. :)

To sum up, I definitely recommend this place for all meat and desert lovers. Menu is very far from being pricy. Turkish Grille is absolutely worth visiting. Will come back many more times!"}
{"text":"This was pleasant surprise to arrive in Pittsburgh, PA, and to find an authentic Turkish restaurant.   The food is delicious, and the service is excellent.  Upon my way out, I let the kind man who took handed me my bill and asked if I enjoyed my meal, that they would receive the highest review on Yelp I could possibly give to them.  He was delighted, and we departed both satisfied for different reasons."}
{"text":"Great new Turkish place in North Oakland! The stuffed grape leaves are wonderful and very fresh tasting. My boyfriend and I also had the lamb gyro and chicken wings and they were both delicious. Each entree comes with either rice or Turkish spaghetti and a salad. The rice and spaghetti were both very tasty, you can't go wrong. We're excited to go back and try more of their menu!

The decor of the restaurant is also really lovely!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend on a late Friday night and the place was not busy at all. Our server was super nice, recommended multiple appetizers, entrees, and desserts for us. Definitely made our first Turkish food experience a great one! Their kazandhibi (creme brulee kinda thing) is delicious. Definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place many times and people really praised it a lot. So, yesterday, when we were nearby this restaurant, we decided to give it a shot. 

Well, this is a Turkish type of a restaurant and it is indeed the fastest food ever: we were a group of 2, we were seated on a table, we gave our orders and our orders arrived within a span of 3-4 minutes. I do not exaggerate, it is really this fast. 

As for the food, this is \"Iskender\" a Turkish speciality. They serve bread (a delicious type of bread indeed), tomato sauce, yoghurt and salad next to it. It was really good . Ambiance is just like a Mediterranean restaurant . Prices, reasonable. 

If you're around, you can try this place and it really worths a special visit."}
{"text":"Stumbled by and thought we would try it out-so glad we did!  Excellent food and friendly staff.  Had mixed grill platter and large appetizer more than enough for 3 people.  Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Quaint, small, family owned restaurant that serve up some excellent Mediterranean food. The menu is short and simple. Quality and quantity is on point, nice quiet place for a date. Its also BYOB"}
{"text":"This is an excellent, well-priced, and unassuming neighborhood restaurant serving some of the better Turkish/Middle Eastern food in the area. I've been here for both lunch and dinner and the quality of the kebabs (had both chicken and lamb) were excellent. Fresh, hot, great seasoning and marination and very good quality meat. Also, we've tried the appetizer combination and the eggplant dishes as well as the humus were both excellent. I've been to a number of similar places (including some other good ones of course) and this is one I will definitely be coming back to as possibly the best food and definitely the best value. Also, the service is quite friendly and nice. By the way, for me, four stars is a great review."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious and so charming! We got the mixed Turkish grille and every piece was scrumptious. Highly recommend, the people who run it are super nice and the restaurant is cozy and special. Zucchini pancakes also were totally worth ordering! We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant and good prices. I come here a lot especially for their lunch specials. Very friendly staff with high-end decorations and atmosphere for low prices."}
{"text":"THE PLACE for Turkish food!! The inside is so dreamy I just want to take my journal and stay there for hours writing and eating hummus. The service and food is bomb..that lamb woah baby highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Delicious food served in warm and friendly atmosphere by an attentive staff who made us feel right at home. Tasty appetizers, well-prepared main dishes and the best rice pudding I've had in a long time - I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered based on the good reviews, but won't be ordering again.

Positives:
- side salad that comes with the gyros is decent
- pita was pretty good

Negatives:
- Chicken is dark meat and white meat & skin and oily. A negative for me, but may not be for others
- gyro is fatty and not very flavorful
- hummus has a nice consistency, but is bland
- White sauce is watery and flavorless
- hot sauce is sambal oelek, an Asian chili sauce. Not what you'd expect from a Turkish restaurant

Overall: disappointed

The delivery was on time and the driver was friendly. However, a good delivery experience won't be enough for me to order from them again."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Authentic and a fabulous find! Best thing to happen to Pittsburgh!  The family owned restaurant is something I encourage everyone to get behind and support...if you have had enough chain restaurants and want the real thing - this is your place.  My family is Persian and the Kabobs here are spectacular!!!"}
{"text":"Foods are very good. Good selections of Turkish foods although some dishes are named in the way folks here can understand. Good portion and optimal service. This is a young place but I'm confident they grow well."}
{"text":"We stopped in for takeout lunch, and had the lamb and chicken gyros with a shepherd salad. Really excellent, with good rice. Not cheap, but the portions were sufficient for another meal for each of the three of us. The dining space was bigger than we had guessed from outside, it's off the beaten path, but it was bright, clean and had white table cloths. A good view of the kitchen adds to the comfort level. I'd recommend to the house to upgrade their takeout-ware, the cheap tinfoil can't be microwaved and there is much better snap-shut plastic available. Definitely on our list of local spots  for casual dining."}
{"text":"We ordered \"Turkish Mixed Grill\" from dinner menu (delivery). It came very fast which is not surprising since our home is just a few blocks far from the place. 
Food quality was good and the portion was huge. It was more than enough for two adults. It came with fresh bread and salad and also Rice. 
The price was average but it's definitely worth a try. Strongly recommended specially for people without experience in Turkish food. It will give you a good insight about what Turkish (middle eastern) foods are and how they server."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise!  I just tried this restaurant, having never heard of it before, because they left a stack of brochures today in the lobby of my building.  I was hungry, and in the mood for some kind of grilled meat because of something I smelled in the elevator on the way down to take my dog out - and there were these brochures just sitting there, so I decided to take a chance, and ordered takeout, sight unseen, and without even checking Yelp.

I ordered enough food for two people for more than two meals - 4 appetizers, one main course, and dessert, plus a drink.  I figured I'd just try it all right out of the gate - and did I mention I was really hungry? :-)

Excellent tabouli (more parsley than bulgur wheat, as many places make it), wonderfully lemony stuffed grape leaves, and babaganush to die for.  It's smoky, with nice, small, even chunks of eggplant, not pureed beyond all recognition like most places do it.  

I also ordered the spinach cigarette borek, which I've never had before.  I had expected it to be crispy since it was fried, but turned out to be more chewy instead, possibly because of sitting on top of some tomatoes and lettuce and in a box in transit before landing on my table.  The pieces were much thinner than I was expecting, too, and so had a lot more phyllo than filling, but it was still very good.  

I wanted the adana kebab for my main course, but they were out of it, so I got the izgara kofte, which is called kofte kebab elsewhere, but this was served as 5 patties of beautifully seasoned meat rather than a sausage-like kebab style item.  It was a little dry and tough, making it rather chewy, which was disappointing, but it was still absolutely delicious.  It was served on top of buttery rice that is also yum, and a side salad chock full of tomatoes with a vinaigrette that is not like that in most Mediterranean restaurants, but still very good.  

The pita is obviously freshly homemade, very light and fluffy/puffy and a bit smoky, also very unlike what is found in most places, and still soft and toasty warm by the time it got here.  With everything I ordered, I got 4 of them, and they are all absolutely huge, so that ought to keep me for quite a while.  I couldn't even eat a whole one - but then again, I had a ton of food and didn't want to fill up on the pita.

I also ordered ayran, which is a yogurt drink that is a little bitter and otherwise pretty bland.  I think I'll save my money next time, at least at home, since I think all I'd have to do is pop some Greek yogurt into some water and mix it up.  I was expecting some more flavor and seasoning, although maybe I'm thinking of another cuisine.

Baklava is, for me, a must-have at a Mediterranean restaurant.  This was good but a little odd: not as sweet as most of them are (which was actually a bit of a relief), and almost a bit chocolatey in flavor, not as intensely pistachio-like as most, and a lot dryer, without the honey usually found in baklava, and denser overall, including the phyllo.  It was still good, but didn't have me clamoring for more, and I will try other deserts next time instead.  Of course, since there were four small pieces, which translated to roughly two regular size ones, it was still quite a bargain for a desert that is usually stupidly expensive.  Chintzy this serving most definitely was not.

Overall, a pretty predictable menu virtually identical to what one finds at almost every other Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant, with all of the expected staples, much like the stereotypical tacos and burritos at Mexican restaurants, but with a lot more well-blended flavor than at many.  

I'm sure the Turks don't eat these same things every day any more than anyone in any other Middle Eastern country does, or than Mexicans usually eat most of what we get in most Mexican restaurants, but it was all still very good.  

I would love to see them branch out and offer more of what Turks really do eat, though, like Naya in Squirrel Hill hews more to *real* Syrian cuisine and away from the stereotypical and predictable same old same old Middle Eastern fare.  This chef clearly has the control over the seasonings that would make me believe that he/she could also easily turn out a more authentic menu and be successful with it. They do at least have some fish items on the menu, which I haven't seen in any other Mediterranean restaurant that I recall, which I will likely try next

They also have a deal that gives you a 10% credit towards future purchases if you order online.  I called instead, though, because it was already 9:15pm, and I didn't know if they would actually get my order in time.  They said it would take 50 minutes - but the guy showed up in a little over half an hour instead.

I see from the photos that there are stairs to get into the restaurant itself, which doesn't bode well for wheelchair accessibility, but I also don't know if they've got a rear entrance that might be accessible."}
{"text":"I have been so many different Turkish restaurants in Usa this one of my favorite one i have enjoyed a lot , service was good especially gyros was great because it was homemade chicken and lamb both of them i would highly recommended  also deserts was awesome especially kunefe"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Their lamb chop is a must-have. For kids, they offer french fries and yogurt drinks."}
