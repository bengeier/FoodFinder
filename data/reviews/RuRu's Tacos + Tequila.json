{"text":"Great experience! I ordered RuRu's through postmates and I was very impressed! Wasn't sure how good it would be having it delivered to my home vs eating it at the restaurant but hey I took a chance and won!! Very good food.....I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here hoping for a relaxing Mothers Day dinner.  The only relaxing part was being able to sit on the beautiful patio.  The staff seemed either exhausted or apathetic.  Either way, we waited to be seated for 25 minutes while tables were empty but uncleared from earlier parties.  We had 5 people with us.  One meal came out steaming hot ; the others came out cold.  It seemed as if 4 of the dishes must have sat out while the 5th was prepared.   The house margarita was ok but not great.  We will go  to our favorite southwestern restaurant in the Southpark area next time."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are awesome, service is so-so (kind of slow).  Good margaritas, but beware of the tequila prices as they are a total rip off...

Overall, a good neighborhood spot and the kitchen is open later than most places."}
{"text":"We had a group of 12 at RuRu's for dinner on a Friday night. I called the day of to make a reservation. We got there early, so we could try the cocktails. The margarita is good, but small for $9.50. Unfortunately, it was raining and the outdoor bar was not open. The outdoor space is great with heaters, TVs and a large bar.  The hostess took us to our table, which she was helping setup. The table was set for 10 people. I told her we had 12 and her response was \"ok\". She disappeared and never returned. We squeezed 12 at our table until the 2 top next to us closed out. Our waiter asked if we wanted to order appetizers but none of us had menus. It took 2 times asking and another 20 minutes to get a diet coke. The food was so-so and the service slow and confused.  But the worst part is the chips and salsa are $5. Even the beautiful outdoor space won't make me return."}
{"text":"This is such a cute restaurant. The patio is so nice, we will definitely be back when the weather is warmer (it was snowing tonight) 
Tip: park in the back off Fenton. (Much easier to find a spot) 
The Pineapple Express jalapeño & pineapple margarita is yummy. I got 3 tacos. (Shrimp, mahi mahi & the tofu) 2 would have been plenty. I was so full! Which is a good thing  You won't leave hungry. The toppings complimented the seafood perfectly. We also ordered the \"This is Sparta\" nachos. It was a very large portion...could have had a few more jalapeños, but still delicious. The cheese is very good. My friends & hubby got the fajitas & said the rice was very bland but the guacamole was good. Our waitress was very friendly also."}
{"text":"Tacos are descent. Portion size for Jasmine rice and Vegetarian black beans very disappointing because it was less than a cup portion and cost $3.50 each. Atmosphere and manager in red shirt was not welcoming or friendly. Place is not very diverse either. I will not be returning. There are far more better places to eat in Uptown."}
{"text":"this is in no way tex mex or Mexican - another Carolina attempt at ho hum Mexican food......"}
{"text":"RuRu's has awesome outdoor seating. If it's not raining, that's where I want to be seated. The whole area out there is just so pleasant, especially at night. It would be a great place to take a date. The inside seating is adequate, but go for the outdoor if given a choice.

If you like fancy drinks they have you covered. If you're a beer lover they don't really hold a candle to all of the places in Charlotte to get fine beer. One of my favorite drinks is the \"You talkin' to me?\" jalapeno margarita (better than Paco's). 

Food-wise they have a pretty nice menu, a little short on veg options but it always tastes great and that's what matters. I usually get the \"That's not snowflake\" tacos with chipotle vinaigrette instead of the chipotle sauce (the sauce has cream in it). If I'm in the mood for eating a lot of food the \"You Got No Legs, Lt. Dan\" fills the belly quite nicely. Also, to there credit, they actually know how to cook tofu, which is rare for non-Asian places.

I definitely recommend trying out RuRu's. Get a seat outdoors if you can!"}
{"text":"First of all, I want to start by saying \"good job\" with the menu. Their entrees are all named after movies. It actually made me laugh. Another thing that made me chuckle; $4.00 (or$4.25) for a single taco. Anyway, started with the chips and queso. The queso was good, but it was a bit runny. I guess I prefer mine so it actually stays on the chip. For my entree I got the \"stage 5 clinger\", the \"long duk dong\" and the \"I'll have what she's having.\"  The long duk dong, which was a Korean style steak taco, was the clear winner in the group. It had the most meat and most flavor of my trio. Now, the \"I'll have what she's having?\"  Totally underwhelming. It came with a tiny strip of dry mahi mahi that I would be embarrassed to serve. Seriously, the avocado slice was bigger than the fish. 

Between the movie references and the creative tacos, I wanted to love this place, but I feel like it just missed the mark. With a few minor tweaks, I really think I could love it. 

The server was terrific though."}
{"text":"Paying for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant is absolutely ridiculous, especially when nothing was that good. Maybe they charge because its in the heart of yuppy Myers Park. Tacos were at most ok. Margaritas were overpriced and not good. Service was ok. Don't waste your time with this place as there are way better Mexican places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Unfortunately knocking my previous four stars to one.  Good food, but service is lackluster and patrons made to feel uncomfortable. The service that I received tonight was so poor that I will not be returning. First of all, the website states that Ru Ru's does not close until 11pm and upon my arrival at 9pm, guests were still enjoying their meals inside as well as outside. We were seated \"upstairs\". Our sever came by later and orders were placed, though we were never offered chips with salsa or queso dip, which was unusual. The server seemed annoyed and hurried, and never returned to check on us after delivering our food. Roughly 25 min. into our meal, 3 or 4 servers came out to do side work next to us and worst of all one started sweeping the floors where we were sitting! The employee was not sweeping spilled food as that would be appreciated. Instead, she was clearly sweeping simply as part of her closing duties because the manager came by to inspect her work. No paying customer who is eating should have to be surrounded by things like this. I asked a random server (not ours since she was no where to be found) what time the restaurant closed since it appeared that we were in the middle of them getting ready to go home; although there was more than an hour to go before reaching 11pm. I was informed that the kitchen closes at 10pm and the bar closes at 11pm. Well, the kitchen area must be the entire interior of the restaurant because when I looked through the window to the left of our booth, I saw several other employees doing the same side work and some were even eating! I have worked in fine dining before and one of the most important rules that often gets repeated is that no employee is to eat in front of or around guests out of an effort to remain professional. I was shocked that the manager, who was present, allowed for this. Once the waitress returned, she asked my partner if he would like more tortillas, mind you his plate was clearly empty by now so she obviously just proved she wasn't paying attention to us at any given time. I asked for a to go plate for my food and upon her return I asked her why the hostess did not tell us the hours of the kitchen as it caused us to become disturbed by the work happening around us, and had we been made aware of this we would have chosen to eat outside. The waitress only gave a bogus apology so I went on to politely tell her that we had never received such subpar service and couldn't grasp any reason for animosity. She took offense and stormed off to prepare our check. As she returned she quipped \"next time feel free to sit outside anytime\".  After we left I followed up with the manager by phone to inform him of the horrible experience and his lack of concern was immediately evident as he already knew of the situation. As one would expect, he stood up for his employee as any good boss would, but unfortunately he took things too far by making excuses for others and then blaming the experience on my partner and I by stating we chose to sit in that particular area. Though it is true that we chose a booth, we are not responsible for being ignored by our server and only he is responsible for the professionalism of his employees, not I. He was equally as rude as our waitress in regards to our concerns of sweeping and said \"well no one was sweeping dirt into your food so I don't see the problem.\" He then switched gears and wished us to return as he would do anything he could to make up for our experience. I don't care to receive free food or a discount so I will not be positioned to ask for such and should I be offered anything of the sort, I would decline. My partner and I don't seek that sort of thing as we are happy to pay full price for good, quality service and the only reason I reached out to the manager is to speak to someone who would take our concerns seriously and offer a sincere apology, unlike our waitress; but like her he failed to do so and only offered sarcasm. He became upset when I told him I would be writhing a review about my experience, even though my intent is not to be malicious, he took it as such. Sincere, quality customer service is not difficult to achieve and that's what it takes to get repeated business."}
{"text":"The three cheese quesadillas are delicious! I called ahead to pick up and it was ready in 15-20 minutes! I had 5 orders. 2 shrimp and chicken, 2 chicken, and 1 just shrimp. It would be better if they labeled the boxes. But all in all so so tasty."}
{"text":"Ru Ru's is a modern twist on the everyday tacos and margs. The outside patio is huge and lively making for a great dining experience. The tacos are really good especially the \"long duck dong\" and the \"I'll have what she's having\". I personally think Paco's Taco's is a better bang for your buck (and slightly better tacos) but the atmosphere at Ru Ru's is truly hard to beat."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it 1 star because I have to. Queso is runny, chips taste like they are from yesterday, salsa is too spicy. After waiting for our tacos for an hour we asked the server to cancel the order so we could go elsewhere. So disappointing. I was looking forward to this. Cool atmosphere though. Too bad I'll never come back."}
{"text":"Delicious gourmet tacos with entertaining names. Longest list of tequila choices I have seen. Great service!  Absolutely fabulous atmosphere. Large fabulous patio as well. First stop during my first visit to Charlotte. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Service is slow at best.  Great patio but be prepared for slow and inefficient service.  However...food is very good!   Worth the poor service.  

Update - they comped an appetizer and drinks on their own accord so that was cool.  Def go check out RuRus.  Good is very good."}
{"text":"The seating outside is lovely.  It is so rare to find a pretty secluded place to sit outside in main Charlotte area.   This venue is very charming and although the restaurant sits in The Villa on Providence which is a busy road, the outdoor seating is on the back side lending itself to a serene feel.  Neighbors know to enter (walking or driving) off Fenton as parking out front can be challenging at times.  I've been there 3 times and enjoyed ordering a different item every time.   The menu is fun and the food is good.   The spirits from the bar aren't the only ones flowing - apparently the staff doesn't like to work past closing as some mysterious things have happened.   It is a beautiful home with lots of history and they'll tell you all about it if they aren't too busy.  I'm giving the food 3 1/2 stars and the bar a 5.   I'm glad Eastover finally has a good neighborhood haunt, if you'll pardon the pun."}
{"text":"Guacamole is perfection! Nice wait staff and creative menu. Music was a little loud for a seated dinner, but patio and bar area are great for drinks after work or on the weekends."}
{"text":"Best place in Charlotte. The steak burrito called The Clarence Beeks is better than any food on this planet and I will fight you if you argue with me. It's close to my house and I go about once a week. Even limped there with a broken leg a couple months ago. There will always be a loud bachelorette party or a girls' night there, but that adds to the greatness of this place. My #1 favorite restaurant, no joke."}
{"text":"16 of went to RuRu's for dinner Thursday night. The service was attentive and the food was good. The steak fajita was excellent. The meat was perfect - slight char on the outside and medium rare on the inside. 
The only note of distaste was the 23% service charge automatically added to the bill. The waitress commented that 20% was for her, which I have no problem with, and 3% was for the person who took the reservation. Since when does an employee deserve $18 for taking a 1 minute phone call for a reservation. That my friends is a ripoff."}
{"text":"My waiter was stoned (slow gait, slanty eyes, forgot an item I ordered).  Food was not spectacular."}
{"text":"After my first time here was a HUGE disappointment, I decided to give it one more try... They sat me facing the kitchen. I watched a guy in the kitchen put cheese dip in a bowl and take his bare finger to wipe the cheese off the edge of the bowl, then he put his finger in his mouth. THEN, with the same hand, pick up some peppers and garnishe the cheese. I got my food, and just like the previous time, it was cold. I sent it back and it was even colder the next time.  It's very unfortunate because it's a great atmosphere. I will say that the manager and server both times were very nice."}
{"text":"We were told there would be a 45 minute wait for dinner. We were seated 2 hours later. One of the hostesses was downright rude while one host was only a little apologetic. The food arrived cold and the skirt steak tacos I ordered were difficult to chew. Our waitress on the other hand was fantastic."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of RuRu's, but the food could have been better. Came here with a group of friends on a Thursday evening, and there was a long wait for the patio. We chose to sit inside with no wait, but since the doors were open on this beautiful evening, we got the best of both worlds. 
Thursday was half-off tequila drinks, so I had a classic margarita, which was perfectly blended. The six of us enjoyed each other's company, shared a Three amigos app of salsa, queso, and guac, and ordered some specialty tacos for dinner. 
After about 30 minutes, our food finally came out. I was disappointed to know my tacos were a little cold. They tasted good, but I wished they were a little more fresh.
My margarita was the best part about my meal, but our server did not come about asking about another round until after our food was served.
I will return soon to give it another shot because I love the location and the ambiance."}
{"text":"First time tonight.  Loved it. Good food. Had the trio dip combo with the chips. The salsa bowl was delicious as were the other two dips which were. Avocado and quesa. Good service. Nice burrito and salads. Patio is great looking , fire coming out of the pedestals was a very classy touch.  Great outdoor furniture. We ate inside. Comfortable booth, well padded. And booth area was more quiet than the bar area which was very noisy. Awesome restrooms, great decor  good service. Great parking.  Should be a big hit. Is a little expensive compared to some simple Mexican places,  they also charged $5 for a salsa refill. Which is free at most Mex places."}
{"text":"I've tried to like it. Food is boring. Went in tonight for drinks they were good bartender was really great.They opened the doors from the outside to the inside when it was 97 degrees outside we ask for them to close them but no so we moved on. We would have stayed longer if it had been cooler in the restaurant. Also noticed the grade was 91 yuck good luck!"}
{"text":"First impression: RuRu's has a beautiful location, a lovely outdoor patio, and a wonderfully unique TexMex menu. 

My husband and I walked from a nearby wine tasting Fri evening to check out RuRu's for our first time. There was a fairly long wait, but we didn't have to wait as long as expected. 

The cocktail menu looked fun and beer menu wasn't too bad - there was a small selection of local drafts...would love to see more local craft options for sure. 

For dinner, my husband opted for a burrito covered in queso and I ordered a strip steak and grilled mahi taco with a side of the creamy white beans. The food arrived quite quickly and looked great. As far as actual taste/quality/value, I was disappointed. The steak was rather tough, the tortillas were nothing unique and the contents of the tacos didn't quite fill them enough. The beans were tasty for sure and I can see why they are so popular. 

Anyways, cool place and definitely worth a visit, but I think I'll stick with Paco's Tacos for their brisket tacos and Cabo Fish Taco for their delish fish tacos."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. I love it! It has a great fun atmosphere and good consistent food. The queso royale and the long duck dong taco are my favorites! Chelsea the manager is extremely helpful and accommodating if you need anything."}
{"text":"Likes: This is not a traditional mexican restaraunt but more eclectic texmex. Good neighborhood location and fun atmosphere and decor with a variety of good margarita-inspired cocktails. Calamari is delicious and I highly recommend it! 

Gripes: The guacamole and cheese dip is mediocre at best. Honestly, it's hard to mess up fresh guacamole when fresh avocados are used (which they are here) but it tasted bland. The tacos are not consistent - some are great and some are just ok. If it were not for the location, I probably would not return."}
{"text":"Rurus is a miss for me. I've been there three times now and each time keeps getting worse. We sat on the patio all three times and have had terrible service. We've had waiters disappear, forget orders and drinks, and bring out wrong orders. The trio was meh - the salsa was way to spicy, the queso water, and the quac bland. I've had several tacos which were also sub par. This past time I had the chicken fajitas and had the most measly piece chicken served on a plate. For the prices of the drinks and food I would expect more.

If you want good tacos and margaritas, head to Bakersfield."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. And I'm going to start off by saying, never in my 28 years on this earth have I ever tasted a taco that had absolutely no flavor. Seriously. I'm going to give this place 2 stars because I ordered through post mates and delivery was pretty fast. 

But really. These tacos had absolutely no flavor, salt, seasoning, etc. The pico de gallo and pineapple salsa couldn't save these tacos. That didn't have flavor either. 

/the end."}
{"text":"I don't like to say this, especially because Charlotte is in need of good new restaurants, but it wasn't good. For starters, you have to pay $5 for chips and salsa. Not free, not $1, but $5!  Then their house margarita is $9.50. The tacos don't come with sides, no rice, no beans, nothing. You have to pay for sides. So without even getting into the flavor of the food, it's pretty clear they are nickle and diming the customers. 

That being said, I have no problem paying (or even overpaying) for good food. Unfortunately the food wasn't great. The carne asada tacos didn't have much flavor, neither did the pork carnitas tacos. Didn't even seem like they seasoned or marinated them.  Really underwhelming. The crispy chicken taco was solid. The $9.50 house margarita was average. And the $5 chips and salsa were good, but not worth the money.  On the plus side, the patio is fantastic. 

Overall there are better, and certainly much more affordable, options for Mexican food in Meyers Park and the surrounding areas."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but do so if service is stellar or dismal.  I am a former longtime Charlotte resident and have eaten at most restaurants ranging from 3 to 5 stars.  RuRu's demonstrated systemic failures on all fronts.  From the pricing, the quality of the food, the timing of the food delivery, and service -- F minus's on all fronts. 

Let's start with the food and food service, which should be the focal point.  A party of 5 seated at 8:30 we were directed to a table too small for our group next to a cold exterior wall.  Being a group too large for the size of the table provided, one member sat against the cold wall the entire time.  When I inquired about the larger open table next to it I was told it was not available because the six member party needed that table.  Once seated we should have been provided silverware prior to the food coming.  Moreover, the food should have come out warm (at least) and around the same time.  One member of our party of five waited a full 15 minutes after everyone else was served before his food arrived.  My food was cold - not warm temp but cold.  My husband's steak burrito was 90% rice.  This was how the meal ended.  

With cocktails before, we had wine, beer and martini drinkers.  When one member ordered a martini a one ounce shot glass of vodka was provided.  He indicated what he wanted was a martini.  They ultimately provided a martini in a martini glass.  A martini of the exact same size and premium choice that you would get at the Gallery Bar at the Ballantyne Hotel (5 star) or Capital Grille Uptown (equally stellar) cost twice as much at RuRu's.  Beyond NYC prices.  Four martinis cost us $90 and that was without the tip, chilled glass and garnish. The explanation provided by the manager was \"that's just the way we price it\".  Seriously??? 

Charlotte deserves better.  Living in Atlanta now we have amazing selections.  Charlotte suffers from not having more consistently good quality restaurants.  RuRu's was a severe disappointment -- far below mediocre."}
{"text":"For years, I have wanted a restaurant to move into this location, in a gorgeous 1920's Spanish villa.  I've always thought that the back patio is gorgeous and would be a fantastic spot for a restaurant; I am so glad that RuRu's decided to go into this location!

As other reviewers have said, the patio is a-mazing.  I can not wait for nicer weather.  There is an outdoor bar, tv, lots of tables / benches, and a beautiful fountain.  

We tried RuRu's on a Wednesday - we arrived around 6:30 and there were plenty of tables available.  When we left at 8, the place was pretty hopping, but I don't believe there was a wait.  

The food was good, but it's kind of a bummer that you have to pay $5 for chips and salsa (this made me give 4 stars instead of 5).  We got the chips and queso ($7) and it was delicious.  The chips are homemade and the queso was some of the best I have ever had.  We both got quesadillas for our entrees - womp womp, we are boring.  I guess we covered the melted cheese and bread options they had, though.

They have a fun drink menu and everything on the menu is named after memorable lines / nicknames from movies.  I took a pic of the menu; sorry if it is a little blurry.  I'll definitely be back and absolutely can not wait for warmer weather so we can enjoy the patio out back!"}
{"text":"I would go back to this place purely for the ambiance and beautiful patio. Sat outside on a nice summer night (that for once wasn't too hot!) They have live music on Wednesdays which was nice but got to be a little too loud if you're having conversation at your table with more than one person. 

Service was very slow, we were there for almost two hours and waited probably 15 minutes each time we ordered drinks. It seems as if they had to go inside for the drinks each time even though there's a bar outside which seemed odd. 

We got the three amigos appetizer which included salsa, guacamole, and queso. The guac and queso were great, the salsa tasted like it came from a jar. I got two tacos, and they were just OK. Nothing compared to Paco's Tacos. Would not come back for the food, but definitely for a nice night on the patio."}
{"text":"Over priced and flavorless vegan options. Is unfortunate, because the patio nice and a 5 min walk from my place. Plenty of other options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"\"Disappointed. Not as good as I had hoped.\"
Met friends for drinks and dinner. The positive: the frozen strawberry margarita was delicious!!! They have one night during the week where margaritas are $5. Had the cheese dip which was not good. Not sure how you can mess up cheese dip but they did somehow. They do have a nice patio area. We decided to go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Finally a great Mexican restaurant in Charlotte! First one, combination of awesome ambiance, delicious food with a little bit of modern and also authentic fair.

Love love- don't forget to sit outside in the awesome patio"}
{"text":"Great deck on the back of the restaurant /w a bar. On of the best patio/decks in Charlotte IMO. 

Food has always been good the dozen or so times I've been there're. It is priced reasonably and the service has been good each time we have visited."}
{"text":"You really want this place to be good. You just know you're going to like it. The atmosphere is outstanding, tucked away in a convenient location in Myers Park, 10 minutes from home.Tacos, everyone loves Tacos. A great looking place with a great looking crowd. Unfortunately the food is mediocre and the service is non existant. Queso with Chorizo is one of my favorites, their's is so runny it drips all over the table when you try to eat it. Wrong Oyster tacos had two oysters....OK. All four in my party agreed their food was kind of boring. And the service is sort of a sweaty overworked crowd that is so disorganized you want to volunteer to help. Lot of missing in action and oh I forgots.  But the place looks just great. You really want to like it because its a great concept in a wonderful location. It wasn't expensive less than $100 for four with drinks. I expected to pay twice that for such a cool looking place, but then I expected it to live up to the hype. I would rather pay double some where else. Friends said it was overrated, listen to your friends."}
{"text":"Delicious taco restaurant in Charlotte!  Usually eating indoors it can be loud but still clean and well decorated, the patio is exceptionally clean and a great place to eat.  The tacos are great and have creative names, my favorites are the \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\" which has skirt steak, and the \"Looking Good Louis\" which has shrimp.  The chips and guac/salsa/queso is super fresh and delicious, and not super filling before your meal.  Overall great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. My life is in NYC but this is my new favorite place to eat Mexican food. First, I Judge all Mexican restaurants by the salsa and it was so good here I could have just had salsa for dinner. Be warned. They don't give you chips and salsa for free. It's okay. Because they were the bomb. Guac on point.  Great food. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Overall, this place had a great atmosphere. Inside, the bar and dining area is very nice, but the outdoor patio area was even nicer. Decent amount of space heaters, outside bar, and a few TVs. I was a little disappointed with the food. Unlike most Mexican restaurants, you have to order chips and salsa. We ordered chips and queso, which was just OK. The chips were great, but the queso was luke warm at best. I also ordered the organic rice bowl, which wasn't bad, but similar to one at Chipotle ($2 less). Overall, this is a great place to hang out and have a drink with decent food."}
{"text":"RuRu's has been one of my favorites in Charlotte for quite some time. I've only been here on the weekend, but I love the ambiance - it's a young, fun and hip crowd perfect for a group dinner before heading out. I bring my friends from out of town here all the time and no one has ever left disappointed! The wait is always fairly long, but the outdoor bar and waiting area are fantastic when the weather is nice and I've never had a problem getting a drink at the indoor or outdoor bar while I wait. I highly recommend the jalapeno margarita! 

I also love the tacos - I've tried a bunch of them at this point, but my favorites are the Stage 5 Clinger and the Fat Guy in a Little Coat (also love the names!). The tacos are large with a lot of toppings and meat, so two tacos is more than enough to fill me up after some chips and guac/queso to start. The thing that I really love about RuRu's is that you order tacos individually, so you can mix and match as you please. The cost is also great - I can get two margaritas, two tacos and split an appetizer with my friends and leave with a bill under $30 (excluding tip). 

Overall, this is a great spot for a fun night out and really great food for the cost - worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. We ordered the trio both times we have gone here and it is so good. Salsa, queso, and guacamole. The chip are very good. I recommend that trio to all!!  We then ordered some tacos.  These were also so amazing. This place is good. I can't wait to come back here again."}
{"text":"We came to Ru Ru's on Sunday and left with an A-OK experience!

Absolutely love the patio here! Fortunately we were able to grab a seat on the patio. It was a bit disappointing when it started to rain and no one working there even offered to help move people. Fortunately, my husband and a nice guy sitting next to us moved some umbrellas around to cover us. In retrospect, it was actually kind of nice dining in the rain. 

Love the menu....everything is named from movie quotes, which is just so fun. I learned that my movie knowledge is very limited cause I was struggling with naming the movie!

Anywho, both my husband and I got the Noda Gordgeous.....I know it's not fall yet, but man, that drink is good!! 

This isnt one of those places that they just immediately bring you out some salsa. We decided to go with the Billy Ray Valentine, which is a chorizo queso dip. Decent size portion and pretty tasty.....that dish definitely was definitely empty by the end of the nide. We also decided to split 3 tacos: Snowflake, I'll have what she's having, and the shrimp one. They came out super super quick. The Snowflake was not my favorite....i think it may have had a little too much sauce on it cause that is all i tasted. Crazy enough, it was my husbands favorite. Agree to disagree. The shrimp was pretty good. However, the I'll Have What She's Having was rock on solid. The fruit in it made the taco!

I really hate to talk about service because I think waiters and waitresses are truly some of the hardest working people ever and get very little credit. However, service was very off. Things forgotten, wrong items brought out, super slow. Honestly, I am totally ok with off service (as we are all human and have bad days) but there wasn't even a recognition of/apology the forgotten/wrong items and slowness. Unfortunately, the couple beside us was complaining too. 

All in all, it was a pretty good experience. 

I know you guys are trying to be a \"nice\" Mexican place, but pretty pretty please get some free chips and salsa in the mix and I'll be a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Best patio in town, hands down. The atmosphere is great and you cant beat the setting/location but I like the food at other taco places better. Will definitely go back and take advantage of the outdoor bar and patio again."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to give this place a try. It's only rated at 3.5 stars here on Yelp but it's totally a 5. One of the best places I've been to since my move to the area in April. You'll want to try the long duck dong taco, it's incredible."}
{"text":"The patio here is beautiful! The food is ok I got the lettuce cup salad which was bland so I don't recommend getting that."}
{"text":"Delicious. We went here on a double date and all 4 of us loved everything we had. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Two of us had tacos, the Mahi Mahi, grilled chicken, steak and pork. Two of us had fajitas.   We loved it all!

We had guacamole as an appetizer. The serving was small, that was definitely a negative. Also our waitress although very sweet was not knowledgable when we asked questions. 

Great tequila selection! They had all of our favorites. 

They don't take reservations. We went at 8:30 and waited about 20 minutes at the bar. 

We hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"came here for lunch one day and grabbed their chorizo queso and the lunch tacos ( grilled chicken, steak, and carnitas) the server was super nice and friendly but the food was really average. the outside area has its own bar and looks super cute so we may come back for a drink one night but I dont' think we'll br coming back for the food :("}
{"text":"Yessssss! This will be my next to go to place. Came on a Monday. Rainy weather kept us from sitting on their patio, but the $5 drinks kept us warm. Love the menu item names! Lots of 80s movie themes. Drinks - that's a pretty purse is the truth!!!! Got the Lunch appetizer special. 2 dips for $8. Got queso and guacamole, very good and fresh. Had 2 servers....they were both knowledgeable, Jonathan was our main server. We had 2 tacos: I had Uncle Buck and Long Duck Dong(great sauce). He had fat guy in a little coat and looking good louis. All good choices. Will return!"}
{"text":"The patio is nice and on a pretty day I would love to sit there and enjoy a glass of wine. It was raining on the day I took my family. Not the most kid friendly place however they enjoyed the steak burrito that they split. I had two tacos and the were ok. As far as Charlotte I think Pacos Tacos sets the bar and RuRu does not meet up to the great flavors at Pacos. My wife taught her tacos were good and would defiantly be back. It was a little pricy for 4 tacos, burrito, two beers and a app for $60. For me it was ok however good atmosphere so I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I've heard some people mention this place and saw some pictures of their outdoor patio which looked awesome. We decided to check it out for a girls night. When we arrived their outside patio was very busy since it was one of the first warn evenings we've had in a while, so while waiting on the table we grabbed some drinks at the bar. The bartender was very nice and attentive, maybe that's where we should've stayed. Half an hour later we got our table under the lights. The server was nice, but ether they were very understaffed or she just didn't care, the whole evening went downhill. We ordered our drinks when server finally got to our table, 5 minutes later she came back and took out appetizer order, another 10 minutes later the apps came out, still no drinks, no water and no share plates.. After a few minutes our server showed up with drinks. I understand that she might've been busy, but she didn't even  acknowledge that it took a while. Even though salsa and queso were ordered only one small plate of stale chips was accompanying it. For dinner all the tacos that we tried were very bland. 
I'd say, have dinner elsewhere and stop by for drinks at the outside patio. Maybe in time once they sort through all the bad staff and add more flavor to food I'll return for dinner."}
{"text":"I went to have dinner with a friend. I like the outside patio in the back with its own bar. There was live music on a Wednesday. Upsetting that I can't eat most of the things on the menu because everything has cilantro in it. The proteins are all marinated in cilantro.  So if you don't like or are allergic to cilantro I do not suggest this restaurant. 
The wine slushy was interesting.  They have a daily drink special. Our server was great. 
I wish the chefs would have some protein options without cilantro. There is only 1 that is not seafood or tofu."}
{"text":"RuRu's is such a fun spot. Their patio is gorgeous - the interior is relatively average. Their drinks are STELLAR: good size, good flavor, good price. We each got two and loved them all.

The food is quite good. The guacamole was very good. They don't quite have as many vegetarian options as I was hoping, BUT the one tofu taco that they have is incredible. I could eat a whole plate of them, so I guess it's not a huge loss for the lack of variety. My dining companion had the mushroom quesadilla and really liked that as well. I got a salad to accompany my taco and it was pretty flat. Not great lettuce, not that many toppings. But I did like the honey lime dressing.

All in all, this is a great spot and I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Quick recap: this place had high praise and that gave me high hopes. While the food wasn't bad it wasn't great either. Worth checking out but keep expectations modest. Service isn't the best but the atmosphere is on point. 

Been here three times. Not a fan of the limited margarita selection. And the fact that the bartender gave me a funny look when I asked if there was a house regular margarita. 

Another time I went on a taco Tuesday (which only applies to buff chicken and ground beef tacos. Lame). Ordered a dos equis Amber with extra lime. Instead I got an old meck copper with no extra lime. 

Tacos were not bad but nothing to brag about. Most taco stands on south Blvd have better tacos for much less $$. If I want to pay 4-5 dollars for a taco I go to Bakersfield. 

I would recommend this place to see if you're a fan of trying something new.  You might get better service than I did and better food."}
{"text":"Barely even Mexican food. This place is for yuppies. 
Margaritas were $9.50 but luckily we went Monday and they were $5.00. Very weak pour.
Hostess was uninterested and sat is at a dirty table.
Charged for chips and salsa- chips were stale.
Guac was good but $9.00!!! Not worth it
Hardly any veggie options. 
Food was decent but so unauthentic. I've had PB&Js in tortillas that were more Mexican.
Service was below average. Nice waitress but seemed to be too busy.

I felt like a sucker for paying for this place. Will not be returning. $45 for two people- nope."}
{"text":"Parking was tight, no fret, they have Rear parking off Fenton.

They have nice outside seating in the back. The food was good, semi limited with veggies, but with what they had it was good! 

BEVERAGES:
·Herradura tequila - ok, Don Julio is much better!!

·Mortimer Duke Margarita- Very sweet, but good!!! I'd order it again!


MEAL:
·Chips- Really good, light not greasy. So delicious!! 
White cheese- OMG, Amazing!!!!  
Salsa- a tad hot & watery but good flavor.

·Cheese Quesadilla w/ cilantro- yummy!! 

·Salad, just romaine and ranch- good! Not many veggie options. 

·Jasmine Red Rice- Pretty good, a tad mushy.

·Fish tacos - my friend loved them! 2 was plenty, 3 was way too many with chips."}
{"text":"Great fun Mexican restaurant...lively, great outdoor patio and bar seating, I like the booths and different seating areas.  Customer service was great...our server knew the menu and could answer all our questions.  Lots of tacos options and fun to mix and match...the menu items are old movie names.  We all loved the \"Stage Five Clinger\" and tried \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\"\"Shake and Bake\" and \"You're Going the Wrong Way\" we also ordered the appetizer trio with fresh guacamole/salsa/queso . Everything was fresh and good!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Fun place to go as a group, with friends or on a date. I'm giving it two stars because of the service. First, the hostess on the phone hung up on me, but not before I heard her say something rude under her breathe. Oops. Not good. Then when we got to to the restaurant, our server was just plain confused- It was like he showed up to work at the wrong restaurant that day. Everything was strange about the people and my whole table of 7 agreed. Maybe next time I'll just go to the bar to avoid the other awkward staff."}
{"text":"Great taco with mahi mahi called I'll Have What She's Having! The other taco I tried is Long duck dong but it's Korean beef marinated & spicy goodness. I liked both & yet Sabor is my favorite taco place in the Queen City.  But then you're comparing apples & oranges cause RuRu appears to be a more restaurant experience & Sabor is a taco grill for fast casual. 
Parking is in the back and I heard it gets tough but I walked so it was easy.
They had my favorite beer on tap--Wooden Robot Good Morning Vietnam is exceptional!!"}
{"text":"Really?  Having to pay for chips and salsa at a mexican restaurant? Plus the salsa sucked. 

Also no kids menu. 

On the plus side, the burrito and quesadilla were okay."}
{"text":"What a disappointing first experience after hearing good things from others. I realize that they must have been understaffed but the lack of awareness and courtesy is astounding. 

After 10-15 minutes, we had to ask a hostess if our table had a server. Our waiter promptly came over and apologized saying he was unaware we were in his section. That's ok. We are reasonable people. 

Realizing that things around us weren't going smoothly we decided to put in our entire order (drinks, apps, and dinner) at once bc who knows how long it might take! I guess we should have specified that we wanted our chips and queso before our entree. All of that came at once. And where are our drinks??? I had to ask the hostess to check on our drink order and get us silverware before we could even eat. 

As we finished up our entree we were still enjoying queso so we asked for more chips to munch in since we also still had to finish our drinks. Our waiter came to clear some empty dishes while we were finishing up our drinks and chips and took the queso away while we were still eating it! He never asked or anything knowing we had asked for more chips moments before. When I told him what happened but told him not to bring more queso when he offered, he got pissed and asked why we even brought it up. We brought it up because we weren't done!!! 

I understand that the waiter was over booked but where was the manager to take some if the heat? Where was the apology for the shifty service?? 

P.S. To top it off, the bathroom stall I used was out of toilet paper. My husband informs me that the men's room was also out of paper towels."}
{"text":"Ruru's has a great patio, but good luck getting a seat out there. I'm not sure why this place is all the rave. The service sucked (only got to order one drink, food runner brought the silverware, had to flag the server down for the check),the food was ok (nothing to get excited about) and the other patrons were very uppity (if you live in this neighborhood you're expected to eat at this restaurant). Don't go to Rurus if you're looking for the creative crowd in CLT. If you'd like delicious tacos, fun atmosphere and a great patio go to Chuy's."}
{"text":"The outside patio of this place is awesome. If you can't get a seat outside then you will be very disappointed if you get stuck sitting inside. It is dark, extremely noisy and to make it worse the music is loud enough to wake the dead and you will never be able to converse with your party much less the servers. The food is very good although I did have a bad experience with the Uncle Buck tacos last night as the oysters were severely undercooked. Like total mush. I've gotten these several times but they were just cooked wrong last night. The drinks are seriously overpriced but they are good, just not worth $9.75 for a tiny cocktail.  Normally the service has been OK but last night we finally had to get up and ask the host to get a waitress to come over to our table after sitting there for 15 minutes with our menus. I would love to give this place five stars, and if I have a better experience when I go back next time, I will delete this review and rewrite it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here, especially the shrimp stuffed jalapeño tacos BUT HOLY COW THE SERVICE SUCKS. We will definitely think twice about returning after a 2 hour lunch today.  Terrible waiter who complained when we flagged him down because he couldn't manage his tables.  Good thing they make a tasty frozen margarita."}
{"text":"Beautiful indoor and outdoor seating space, tacos were amazing and the quesadillas are huge! Added steak to my quesadilla, best skirt steak on a taco in Charlotte. Usually other taco places lack in flavor or in tenderness when you add steak, but this skirt steak was seasoned (juicy) and cooked to perfection. I will be recommending this and making this my new lunch spot"}
{"text":"Three strikes you're out: I gave this place three chances and all three times I had the same 3 sub-par experiences. Food is just okay, food is over-priced, and service leaves much to be desired. The first time I went it was brand new, so I tried again. Second experience, still fairly new but super busy, so I thought one more time.... but this time there was no excuse, particularly for the lack of enthusiasm by the wait staff. This is beer food at champagne prices."}
{"text":"This place is hands down dripping in awesomeness. The layout is hot as well as the waitresses. The guacamole was the best I've ever had and the menu names using lines from classic comedies was excellent. References to \"Trading Places\" and \"Fletch\" were epic. The tacos, sheer amazing. Get beer, tequila, and tacos with your Bill F**king Murray shirt and life is awesome."}
{"text":"If you read my reviews you already know I'm a fan of all things Mexican. Well RuRu's fit perfectly into my obsession. 

I'd visited once before for a Yelp event and instantly became a fan of their patio and live music (that guy is awesome!). This visit was no different, I enjoyed everything! 

My friend and I stared with the Billy Ray Valentine. Nikki is absolutely right, it's queso on steroids! Trust me...if you're already a fan of the cheesy goodness, this takes it up a notch by adding chorizo, corn relish and some pico. Delish!!  I tried to get a picture, but my friend and I were finished it too fast.

I ordered two tacos:

Fat Guy in a Little Coat which is their version of a skirt steak taco with avocado aioli and queso topped with cilantro and lettuce. It was very good. The char on the steak was just right and the avocado aioli was a nice touch. 

Looking Good Louis which is their shrimp taco with chipotle aioli, lettuce and pico. The shrimp were seasoned nicely and had just the right amount of spice on them. I was a huge fan of the chipotle aioli. Yum. 

Our waitress was fun and we just had an overall good time. I will say it can get a bit loud inside once the music starts but just find you way to the patio and you'll be just fine."}
{"text":"This place only having 3.5 stars is a disservice.

Consider the atmosphere and cool location.

It's a bit pricey is it's only downfall.  But, you're off ****-ing providence for goodness sakes."}
{"text":"Hands down best margaritas in Charlotte. Go on Monday for $5 margs or Tuesday for a special taco flavor. So delicious, I love this place"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican joint in Charlotte. This is located in Myers Park around the Providence/Queens Rd area. Back side of Stagioni. The food is great, tacos come by themselves and no side. Things like fried oyster tacos are a home run. The patio is hands-down one of the coolest in town. Parking can be tough."}
{"text":"I hate to make one of my first Yelp reviews one with so few positive comments.  But I must say I am very disappointed in my RuRu experience.  I came alone on a Saturday afternoon and service was terribly slow and almost nonexistent.  The food can only be described as mediocre at best.  The queso was the best thing I had and it left much to be desired. I also had the crispy chicken tacos and the Korean steak taco. Both were bland  and the steak was tough.  

I will continue to visit Bakersfield for my taco and tequila fix."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Tucked away in Myer's Park, this place sports a fantastic patio, excellent food, unique and flavorful tacos we decided we're the best tacos ever! Our Mexican friend agrees. ;)
The beverages were equally impressive. Try the Poltergeist Mule! And ask for Logan...he was an excellent server!"}
{"text":"I am completely RuRu's obsessed. No shame. 

My favorite part about RuRu's is the amazing atmosphere. We sat on the patio a few weeks ago and it was so delightful- beautifully done. It is so unlike anywhere else that I have ever been in Charlotte. The service can be a little slow at times, but I actually prefer that over pushy waiters/waitresses. Both the guacamole and queso are delicious here- even the salsa is extra good!

I have tried every salad that they offer and they are all delicious and unique. I did not enjoy the burrito bowls as much- I would definitely not order one again. The tacos are also excellent, but very small. RuRu's also has great drinks- I LOVE that they serve frozen margaritas. Ask for the Mango, I promise you won't regret it!! 

If you can't decide about whether or not to try RuRu's, I would definitely say give it a chance. I had very positive experiences here and can't wait for more long dinners on the patio during the summer!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just happen to stop by this place as we were in the area and saw it on the map. It's alittle hard to find depending on what side you come in on. It's located in what appears to be a historic home from the outside too. The restaurant has a awesome outside patio that's lite up at night and brings in a crowd. The food has fun names such as \"Ill have what she's having\" and \"Bueller, Bueller\". We both enjoyed the meals we had and the fast service we received. They have a large drink menu and the portion of food are large. We have since been back and enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"We've only been twice (1x dining in, 1x take out)

I discovered this place via a yelp friend check-in... the creative names and pics had my attention!!!!

We drove up from Columbia specifically to eat here and were not disappointed.

We parked off providence and were a tad but confused on how to get in to the restaurant.
Once we found our way, we decided to sit outside... it was super busy on a Saturday and only one table was open (and clean) so we sat in the BLARING HOT sun... as soon as another table with an umbrella was cleared we moved!!!
Only downside - there was a wasp burrowing in the wooden bench were we sitting on (paranoia for me)!

We ordered the trio app (loved every single bit of it) and 6 tacos (see pics).
I was a fan of the uncle buck - I'd never had an oyster taco before and RuRu's did it right!
My bf enjoyed all of his choices - I also ordered the fish and tofu tacos and neither were life changing for me.
My son got a plain cheese quesadilla and enjoyed it as well.

We returned a few months later to get to-go (I only ordered the uncle buck) - I tried to order an authentic Mexican soda (I saw them on their menu via yelp), but the bartender said they only carried Mexican coke. Boo!
We also parked in the back this time and entered through the patio.

Overall good experience both times - I'd recommend this joint if you like trying creative tacos!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth trying. The food is great! Came here on a whim with friends. The chips and salsa are not complimentary (c'mon son)! Love the idea of menu items named after movies or movie characters. Ordered the \"Long Duck Dong\", \"Stage Five Clinger\" and the \"Uncle Buck\". Of those three, I can't remember which was the best...they were ALL equally delicious!! The sangria was a little watery for my taste, but others in my party enjoyed it (guess I'm the lush!) Will be returning to Terry other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Fun whimsical menu, great names!! Patio is a \"hidden gem.\" Cocktail list is thoughtful and well rounded!! Highly recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing except bar service. Our dining experience was most definitely 5 stars. Server was quick, super nice and our food came out excellent. Afterwards, we wanted to go grab a drink outside but it was too busy so we opted to sit at the indoor bar which was nice. However, after asking to have the channel changed to something other than golf... The bartender had to be asked twice...then he had to go ask the manager...and 30 minutes later the channel never was changed. Needless to say, we finished our drink and got the bill. This is only frustrating because 1) no one else was watching the tv 2) we were really enjoying our time but felt that we were more of an annoyance than appreciated customers. This would have been a 3 star if the food service wasn't as amazing as it was."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Perfect for a spring or summer night out. Amazing patio. Great food and drinks."}
{"text":"This place has great potential for fun times with a huge outdoor patio and bar. I'm already visualizing the Cinco de Mayo party. The outdoor fire  was lit up on this chilly night and as you walk in, you're greeted by the friendly staff and welcoming patio. The indoor bar area was designed very well, with high tables, low tables and a long bar running the length of the room. The restaurant has a comfortable setting throughout. The music was hit or miss...for a tequila restaurant and bar, I would expect something more upbeat than the Righteous Bros. I think they are still working out the kinks on music but I'd go with your traditional Mexican theme. We don't really need another Chuys. What I mean is...there is room for a legit Mexican restaurant in town so own it. Your space lends itself to the title. The queso and guacamole were crowd pleasers. Chips and salsa were not free. I'm from California and never have I visited a Mexican restaurant that doesn't provide free chips and salsa. Considering your $10 micro-margaritas, I think it's something you might consider. We ordered it anyway and it was average (marinara tasting) but extremely fresh tasting. In fact, everything here seemed fresh and made with care. I would go with the queso before the salsa. The chips were impressive and unique. The margaritas were delicious (legit with lime juice and tequila) but also very small (dusted in a few slurps). There was more ice in the glass than liquid. I think the idea was to let the ice melt but I was too thirsty and the 3-4 ounces were gone quick. Kudos for having local beers on taps. The tacos were in flour tortillas and served street style. Between the 4 of us, I think we tried all of them. I loved the grilled chicken but will pass on the carnitas next time. My chicken taco was hearty but the carnitas taco was quite skimpy and the biggest chunk, a piece of fat. Others confirmed the grilled chicken was good. I didn't hear any comments (good or bad) about the mahi or steak tacos on the other side of the table. The white bean side was interesting. I'm not sure if I would go that route again but I'm glad I tried it. Huge tip: Park around the back of the building. Traveling on Providence towards Uptown, pass The Villa and make your first right. Then take your second right into the clearly marked, The Villa Parking Lot. The entrance to RuRu's is actually in back so it's a win-win. Don't park in front - limited spaces and you'll have to walk around anyway. A large parking lot was a huge plus. Lastly, service was prompt and friendly. The new employees seem happy but it was also apparent that the names of the dishes (all movie lines such as my favorite \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\", was a confusing way to name dishes versus calling it, Grilled Chicken Taco. It was fun though. This is a happy addition to Charlotte and I hope they continue to improve on a great foundation. I cannot stress enough how awesome the design of the restaurant and bar are. We also liked the street style taco and small portions for good value. Even with my few not so favorable comments, it's well deserving of 4 stars after two days of being open. I'm sure it will get better and better with time. And, if you want us to buy tequila, then we want to hear some lively music at the risk of changing your Hollywood, eclectic Pandora station."}
{"text":"The place has a great setting and patio but didn't execute given the assets in place. More time should be spent adding taste to the food Instead of concocting corny names for the menu items. Chips were stale. Salsa was good, not great. Chicken for fajitas was legit but rest of items on the plate were bland. 

Service ranges from inconsistent to inattentive. But friendly. Just seemed the management and processes were lacking. 

Given the cool patio setting, it should be one of the most festive environments around but the strange house music selections made it awkward. 

Margaritas: the spicy one was too sweet. The frozen house margarita was better. 

This place could be a winner if they get it together , if not, it's just an also ran with a high rent payment."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! First off, beautiful restaurant especially the outdoor patio. Staff was very friendly. For drinks, I got the el diablo azul and it was sooo good. Great ratio of liquor to juice. We got the queso to start which did not have an awful artificial taste that often accompanies queso. Perfect way to start the meal. Then we got two burritos the death by ruru and the steak burrito. Death by ruru was very spicy but both burritos were huge and delicious. Prices were very reasonable. Definitely walked away full and happy. Did not try tacos but will def be back. 

TL;DR - lots of great food at an affordable price, come hungry"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Friday night and the food was amazing the first time! We raved about it and had some friends meet us here for a second time and it was the absolute worst!!! The rice in my burrito was very crunchy... The steak was not seasoned and the food was not hot at all! The salsa was not good like it was the first time. We never came back! Having to pay for chips and salsa major disappointment"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon RuRu's while driving through Charlotte and craving some Mexican and it was the perfect fixin'! They offer a wide variety of well made and unique taco's in addition to their more common place Tex-Mex dishes. The food was all well crafted and tasted great! I especially appreciated the outdoor patio setup, it had a cool Spanish Medeteranian feel to it with all the stone work. I went for a late lunch but with the outdoor bar I'm sure the patio is a great time in the evenings!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 2 stars because the place is beautiful and the drinks are good. The food, however, was disappointing. Everything we ordered was bland. It seems like they don't season the food correctly. The right amount of S&P goes a long way. The guac was bland, couldn't taste anything - no salt. The salsa was bland - no salt. The oyster taco was bland. The mixed fajitas we got was overcooked and bland. Oh, and the chips were overcooked. 

With a great location and vibe, I would expect the kitchen to have done a better job. Nothing that a good Chef won't fix."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! I shared Frank the Tank with my bro and it left us with such a buzz! The service was great and the food followed suit! Our server was really sweet and the burrito was super tasty! Def add the hot sauce but on the side since it is really spicy! The location and decor added to the great ambiance. We came during the week and parking was easy. Left very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Ruru's has great Mexican food, good customer service, and a tucked away intimate location. I was very impressed with our server, Rico, and their guacamole is out of this world! I got so full on guacamole that I ordered the small \"Bend and Snap\" salad and was completely satisfied. 

Ruru's supports Charlotte's local breweries and, much to my delight, serves Birdsong's Jalapeno Pale Ale which pairs masterfully with Mexican food! 

The only down side of Ruru's is that they're kind of hard to find. I was able to snag a parking spot in the front lot, but quite honestly don't have a clue how to find the secret back parking lot. I'll worry about that on another day!

Ruru's also has a fabulous patio, but it was 1,000+ degrees last night so we didn't get to sit outside. I vow to return in cooler weather to find the secret back parking lot and enjoy patio dining. 

Ruru's is quite a little gem nestled discretely in Myers Park!"}
{"text":"I ordered 3 tacos(buy 2 get 1 free Friday)....mahi mahi, pork, and chicken and all the meats were overcooked and not well seasoned....not a good look if the tacos are your specialty.  Subpar chips and salsa are $5 and extra salsa for your tacos is an extra charge.  I'll pass on this spot, there are far better taco options in the city and sadly this is not one of them."}
{"text":"4 stars because my Long Duk Dong's were banging! My fellow Yelpers didn't let me down. I also had the I'll Have What She's Having and chips and salsa. Back to the Dong, lol. The sweet and spicy skirt steak was muy delicioso. I just loved the asian and mexican fusion in that taco. Our server, Hunter, was pretty awesome as well. Big shout out to Hunter for handling a large party. 

Like many other Yelpers have posted, the parking can be a bit challenging because if you GPS the location, it takes you to the front and there's very minimal parking in the front. You have to go around the corner on Fenton Place and park in the rear. There is olenty of parking in the rear. 

My friend was celebrating her birthday, so they gave her complimentary churros, which werr quite delicious!

I absolutely love how their food and drink menu is movie themed. You could definitely make up a game of guess that movie with the one liner menu options for the food and drinks. Real quick, in what movie is there a character named Long Duk Dong? If you don't know Google it!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite spots until tonight around 8pm. Some friends and I went for cinco de mayo tonight. I walked up to the host and told her I had a party of eight. She immediately said oh we won't be able to sit. Party of eight. While I looked around an me saw other big parties waiting also. I said well how about you take my name and I will wait anyway. So she said ok and took my info. Then said let me know if you decided to leave. It was very rude and I felt discriminated against. Oh I left out the part about the guy standing
Beside her not sure who he was that said yea we probably can't seat you. They won't get my business or any of my friends around town. My husband and I own a barbershop and we will also tell all of our clients not to patronize such a place. The food is good but not good enough for me to get horrible service."}
{"text":"I've been told it's a new place with outdoor patio area.. So I decided to check it out. I love tacos and Mexican food in general..It is large and kind of authentic inside but the tacos I had, (grilled mahi mahi and the pork taco) were really bad. I couldn't even finish. The slaw was not good and the meat on top was not tasty. Also it came with flour tortillas..overall really bad. I will not come back here."}
{"text":"Good specials each day of the week! The menu names are clever and the patio rocks! Get the tacos for your food choice, I love the long duck dong tacos"}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, great little outdoor patio.  I can easily eat 4 of their tacos.  But can someone please tell me how they can charge for chips and salsa!?  I've never been to a Mexican place that does this, except for Chipotle, which doesn't really count."}
{"text":"Was excited to try a new taco Tuesday place, left slightly disappointed.
Met some friends here one Tuesday. The place was busy when i arrived and my friends already had got a table. I have no idea why this table is even an option. It directly in front of an open kitchen. It is the worst. High traffic area with lots of clutter not to mention having to heat the kitchen noise. That table shouldn't even be there!
My friends had already ordered the trio of guacamole, queso and pico. It was good and flavorful. 
Our server was very knowledgeable about he menu and drink options. We inquired about what tacos are for taco Tuesday, try only offer two. A tilapia and a buffalo chicken. Disappointed by the option, however i decided on a buffalo and their fat guy in a little coat taco.
Happy i didn't order the fish taco, it looked basic with one friendly getting a decent amount and one getting barely any.
The buffalo chicken was good, but very basic. A place this known for tacos could of added some flare to these.
The fat guy in A little coat taco could of been great but the aioli ruined it for me. I love aioli, this one came with an avacado aioli, but this one tasted like straight up mayo on my steak taco.
The food coming out the kitchen (since we had a front row seat) was looking good and I May give this place another try but for taco Tuesday lovers, this is not the place."}
{"text":"I get that I don't eat like most Yelper's.  I eat at odd hours,  usually alone, and not complicated in my requests.   So....my 3:30 pm lunch went off without a hitch.   Two tacos, a Corona draft, water, and a neat tequila since it was 1/2 priced Thursday, and I sit at the bar.   How can you screw it up?   They didn't!

Maleah, my server was friendly and talked openly about how she likes it here,  how jammed they get,  and what food she recommends.   Cool.  Tacos arrived quickly on a hot plate.  I gobbled 'em down (but nursed the booze).  So good.  I liked the oyster taco the best.  Great joint.  I'm hoping to sit on the rear patio when the weather warms."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to a scavenger hunt we were a part of. It did not disappoint. Very cool venue. Outdoor patio is shaded and super nice. DOG FRIENDLY TOO (if they behave). 

I got three tacos because they were B2G1 while we were there. Each was was roughly $4.00-$4.25. Here is what I got:

Tacos in order left to right...

Fat Guy In a Little Coat:
Marinated Steak, Lettuce, Queso Fresco, Cilantro, Avocado Aioli

Get Off My Lawn:
Jalapeño pepper stuffed with shrimp and cheese, tempura fried, pickled cabbage, salsa roja 

Long Duck Long:
Korean Style Sweet & Spicy Steak, Red Cabbage, Sesame Seeds, Cilantro, Creme"}
{"text":"Yesterday was our second visit back to this establishment and although their tacos are pretty good, their service is absolutely abysmal. First it was our drink order. I ordered a water and a sangria and my girlfriend ordered a Diet Coke along with a water. Fifteen minutes roll by and our waiter comes back with just my sangria. He then disappears for another 10 minutes. He returns with her Diet Coke so we decide to go ahead and order an appetizer along with our dinner order. Fast forward another 15 minutes and the chips and queso we ordered as our app never even show up and at this point I was so mad I didn't even want to mention it to our waiter. Nor did I even mention the beer that I ordered that never came. Finally our tacos arrive and the four that I ordered and the two that she ordered were not even plated properly. Hers were mixed with mine and mine with hers. Looking through all the reviews for this place and the root of the problem seems to be the service, which is a real bummer since their food is pretty unique and good. If service continues to be a problem all the time then I'm assuming that comes from piss poor management. It will be a while before I consider coming back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this outdoor patio, live music and creative drinks. This is an excellent place to hang out this summer and it's Mexican!! Can't wait to spend more time investigating their menu. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food, mediocre service. The tacos are excellent, as is the drinks selection. The service staff, however, left much to be desired. The server left us waiting 30+ minutes for our drinks and acted like it was an honor for us to be served. The server who delivered the food grunted in monosyllabic, caveman-like tones and shoved our food at us. Recommend the food, but suggest you go to the bar and avoid the wait staff altogether."}
{"text":"Trendy \"Mexican\" restaurant. 
Went there for a date with my husband and had a hard time talking because it was just so noisy inside. Outside was just as loud.

The server was a bit spacey and kept forgetting to check on us, bring silverware, or get our drinks. I Ordered the steak taco and the shrimp taco. The steak was a bit bland and the sauce overpowered the taco. The shrimp was flavorful. 

All in all, the food was not bad but a bit pricey; especially charging $5 for salsa!"}
{"text":"Splurging on average drinks and Mexican food in a really cool atmosphere. I wasn't wow'd, but I also didn't hate it. Beautiful outdoor seating and the inside has a nice vibe. Beware of the fried oyster taco. I would probably forego that one, the oysters seemed \"off\". The duck taco was okay, I just wish the duck meat wasn't so tough. They could easily turn it into a duck confit taco and it would be amazing. Margaritas are average and too expensive for the size glass you get. Either more tequila or a bigger glass would be fair. Salsa and guacamole were pretty good, if you're interested in paying $6 for each. 

The atmosphere and friendly staff save this place from being a 2 star. The service needs to be stepped up. It took us an hour to get 6 tacos on a mildly busy evening. I would recommend this place, however with caution and curbed expectations."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place just for that fabulous patio.  We tried 4 types of the margaritas and they all tasted off, like the lime juice had turned.  We also had the three amigos.  The queso was the best out of the three by far.  The guacamole didn't have much flavor and the salsa looked so red and fresh but I couldn't get over the one flavor that I believe was cumin.   Just not my favorite, the salsa would have been awesome without it."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving 2 stars is due to my first visit with my girlfriends one night. Our hostess was amazing and the waitress was fabulous. The food was scrumptious. I had the Shirley you're not serious. They had a drink special that was so good we ordered 3 of them. We were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday and we stopped there for dinner before heading out. Now flip that with my visit on yesterday. I wanted to take my boyfriend there for a nice and funny lunch (the menu is all movie quotes, pretty fun and one of the plus) but it was a totally different experience. The hostess was sooooo rude (yes it deserves that many o's). The waiter was fine, but the hostess put a horrible taste in my mouth. First she sees us walk in, but another waiter that was standing on the other side of the hostess stand had to say you guys will be seated in a little while. I couldn't think of the name of that wonderful drink and tried to describe it, but the bartender absolutely did not hit the mark. It just tasted like sangria. Which makes me sick.  The jasmine bowl was awful. The rice was over cooked and the chicken tasted as if they opened a bag of pre-cooked strips from the grocery store and dumped it in the bowl. I was utterly disappointed. Needless to say, we were not rushing to tell friends about this place. Ugh!  And my first experience was such the draw. And again the ONLY reason for my 2 stars was my first trip to RuRu's."}
{"text":"This place is a little oasis hidden from view by a beautiful tucked away landscape. The tacos here are specially made with a twist. The majority of the menu is only tacos and you will not be disappointed. They play live music on the weekends outside on the patio when the weather is nice. The drink menu isn't too much to look at, but if you tell the bartender what you'd like they will mix it up for you!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here to grab lunch with some colleagues and it was awesome! The patio area outdoors is just delightful and cozy and it was a perfect day to eat outside. 

I ordered the Reuben Feffer (I think) which was an organic brown rice bowl with lettuce, black beans, cheese, and steak. It was delicious... I loved it. I would definitely come back and have it again. 

Great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"I recently visited RuRus with my fiancé and I have to say i was disappointed. The good: the queso royale is seriously delicious! Hands down best queso I have ever had. The crispy chicken taco is also very tasty and reminds me of bang bang shrimp with the chipotle sauce. And the bad: the steak taco was very chewy, I ended up having to take half the steak off the taco because it was too tough to eat. The pork carnitas taco was extremely sweet and dry. I ended up sending this back to be replaced with the crispy chicken taco. The mahi mahi was VERY fishy tasting. Not sure if it was old or what but took one bite and sent it back. 

The staff was very friendly and apologetic for the issues with the food and the were more than happy to replace the tacos we didn't like with another. Not sure if I visited on an off day or what but it seems like their menu has some kinks to work out."}
{"text":"Even after reading all the bad reviews, I still wanted to check this place out. I was determined to go, and hopeful that I would have a good experience. Nope. Extremely disappointed. We were seated at a dirty table, and we had to ask 3 different people to clean it, 2 of which seemed annoyed that we were asking them to do so. When our food came, our order was incorrect (I ordered 3 tacos, how does that get messed up). And, just as previous reviews said, the food was terrible. The steak was bland. No seasoning. The chicken was practically burned. I get \"blackened\" but this was way too charred, and again, bland. Easily one of the worst meals I've had in Charlotte. Just bad. I will never go back"}
{"text":"I am going to start by reminding you that I am not a Chef. I have though, eaten in some of the best restaurants in the US. And....my mother cooks for my daughter and I, Hispanic Soul food almost every night (yes, be jealous). I went to RuRu's on a Sunday with my girls to catch up. We are a great big happy bunch. We don't look for faults we are looking for a good time being that we are all mommys and we need it!
RuRu's had an amazing selection of Tequilas (for being a little Charlotte Restaurant). Their drinks though(specifically my strawberry margarita) reminded me of a drink that I would get served in club. You know...the grown drink. That is not necessarily bad...but..who wants to be grown while drinking a Margarita?! Ok, fine. Move on to the appetizers. We ordered the Queso with Chorizo (Queso: watery with kind of a corner filled with chorizo grease). Tasty but not impressed. And the nachos with no meat. Super Duper plain. Ok fine. So I asked our server which was his favorite Taco. He said the Korean duck something. Ok, cool. Let me try it. 
This is where I have a problem. This is obviously and \"upscale\" Mexican/bar/restaurant...I asked for a corn tortilla. Obviously, these are bought at the Harris Teeter down the corner because they weren't fresh nor hand made, which is very easy to do. The duck tasted extra sweet and like marinated flank steak. Ok, fine. I asked him later to bring me the Mahi Mahi with cilantro and pineapple. I imagined a seared Mahi marinated, tangy, lime, fresh pineapple...Nope. This tasted/ look like two small pieces of fried tenders to fit in the very tasteless corn tortilla with a couple of tiny pieces of plain pineapple and a bunch of cilantro.
Common guys!!!! It's not that hard to get tacos right? A fancy name to a taco doesn't mean quality....Ok fine. I had fun with my girls..but...not coming back. I suggest you watch the Episode of a Chef's Table on Netflix featuring the Mexican Chef and his journey to make the perfect taco with original ingredients. Inspiring and NOT HARD!"}
{"text":"Great environment! Tucked and hidden away-the patio is gorgeous.  The long duck dong Taco is great. The bleek burrito was also great! I do think this place is over priced but I would go again for the environment and the creative menu. The food is good but expensive for Mexican food. Try it out if you haven't !"}
{"text":"This place was so awesome I came home tonight and immediately opened my computer to share the wealth.  I first heard about this little strangely named taco joint on Cinco de Mayo.  All the cool kids were doing it, but the wait was THREE HOURS.  Tell me, who the hell waits three hours for tacos?!  I was not about to play that game.  But a non-assuming Monday night for a friend's birthday? YEP.

I'll start by saying RuRu's needs better signage out front. The parking is a bit confusing, but just go around back (that is NOT what she said).  After you actually find the restaurant it is stunning!  A lovely patio, wooden bar, antique with a touch of modern.  Very, very cool.  While I'm talking about décor, I will also mention that the artwork (allisonsprockfineart.com) was so cool that I texted pictures of it to my friends and the music had me singing almost every tune.  Very laid-back vibe, in an upbeat way - if that makes sense?

THE FOOD
First, we got a kick out of reading the menu.  All the dishes have one-liner names.  I ordered the Alliteration something Louis, which means shrimp tacos with a side of the Tuscan white beans.

Mostly I ordered the white beans because I just worked out, was super hungry, and was afraid that two tacos wouldn't fill me up.  But let me just preach really quick - I would have eaten a serving bowl of those freaking beans.  I have no idea how the hell they did that but the beans had a creamy tomato sauce with a hint of lemon. Sounds weird, but wow wow wow.  The beans are pretty much the reason I'm even writing this review at all.

We got the three amigos (or something) appetizer, that had guac, salsa and queso and everyone was raving about how good the guac was.  It was fresh and chunky with the perfect compliment of tomato, onion and seasoning.  Plus, warm chips (shiver).

One girl got the Korean Taco, which sounded like it would be overwhelming, but it was really, really good.  I will probably get that next time.  I also heard great things about the mahi mahi.  Actually, now that I think about it, no one had a complaint the entire time.   We all agreed that RuRu's puts Cabo and Bakersfield to shame a little - sorry guys!

DRINKS
There are specials every night, and the cocktail list was impressive.  They are $9.75/each, which could get pricey.  But the specials and the beer list were on par.

SERVICE
As a waitress, there is something intimidating about seating 6 girls.  I know this because I did it for years.  Our waitress was excellent and had really hot white/purple hair (not important, but still worth noting).  She gave us all great suggestions and was nice enough to help us split the bill at the end which is always a pain.  

OVERALL
Overall RuRu's is fab!  It would be a perfect romantic date spot or girls night out.  It's fun and delicious and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The food, atmosphere and drinks are great. Their outdoor patio is so cute and the entrees have such funny names. I love their appetizer the three amigos: Salsa, queso and guacamole. It is honestly the best combination to have at a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but crappy service.  This was our first time here, so we ordered waters with a few food items to test the waters...  The bartender took our order and we never saw him again.  We couldn't even order any cocktails or more food, which is a shame because it was really tasty.  We had to suck on ice cubes to soothe or tonnes from the spicy food.  Not a good first impression for a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh RuRu's... Meh is as good as it gets. I love your space. Your patio is absolutely killer. But there is as far as my love for you will go. The food is a total let down. Bland, boring, and overpriced. It is so disappointing. I'd love to see you bump up the quality and the flavor of your food. I don't think it is going to happen because you don't need to. Your space is always overflowing with young, hip folks that don't have taste buds. Oh well... I'll take mine elsewhere."}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance of this place. Hidden in the back of the Villa off Providence it is like a little oasis with its large gorgeous patio. The inside is nice, classy, and perfect for a girl's night over frozen margaritas or first date. Parking out back is easy.

My SO and I had wings as an app. I recommend them. They are crispy and covered in a tasty sweet chili sauce but not spicy. We shared a few tacos. We loved the skirt steak, carnitas, Korean steak, and crispy chicken.. Not crazy about the tofu (not much taste) or mahi mahi. The \"famous\" creamy white beans had way too much lime but overall okay. 

Great service, our bartenders were very nice and attentive. I cannot wait for the weather to warm up to enjoy that patio! Lots of other yummy looking items I look forward to trying. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"A group of friends went to RuRus last week. From the minute I walked in until the minute I left, it was BAD!! The hostess acted like she didn't have time for me (staring out the window). She finally walked away and someone else asked if I needed help.
Next our waiter, was gone more than present. The restaurant was busy on the patio, but empty inside. Every course of our food took a VERY LONG time. So long we had to search for him to get... water refills, more drinks and our food. I can't even think about recommending this place. Oh yeah the food wasn't anything that could make up for the terrible service."}
{"text":"This is the only place in this world (literally) were I have eaten a burrito and have truly enjoyed it; but with any burrito, everything is to one side, I would suggest asking for them to mix the inside. I also love their tocos but I would always suggest getting a corn tortilla instead of a flour, it makes the taste pop even more!"}
{"text":"Good food. I wish you made homemade tortillas. Can't do more than 3 stars with Store bought tortillas. I've been eating fresh for 20 yrs. Flavor of all tacos was good. Korean was legit!
Roasted hot sauce was not good. I don't care for that flavor profile. I would like other options. Margarita was best I've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Sadly, this is one of the worst dining experiences I've had in recent memory. This was the second try at RuRu's, the first coming shortly after opening. While the first experience was just \"ok\", I figured it was just new place kinks. Unfortunately, if anything, things have gone downhill. 

It was a busy night, assuming because it was National Margarita day. We were told there'd be a wait, but it ended up being a brief one. The hostess took my cell phone # to text when the table was available. Great idea, but not particularly helpful since AT&T service doesn't exist in the restaurant. While we waited, we got drinks at the bar. The only redeeming aspect of this visit was that the margaritas were very good and hand shaken. But, the bartender soured those by just tossing the processed check back at us, rather than saying thank you, or actually handing it back. 

Once we were seated, things continued to head south. It took over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged. We ordered an app and another drink to start. The waiter forgot both and the kitchen manager (who appeared to be the only hard working person there that night) brought it out to us. The writer was reminded of the drink and eventually brought it over. We were never offered waters and had to ask for silverware. The chorizo queso was both greasy and watery. After about 20 minutes, it thickened up some. 

We then ordered the main part of dinner, a sampling of tacos. The kitchen manager brought out the tacos, again, after a fair amount of delay. The waiter must have forgotten to place the order for beans, so the kitchen manager had to go back and bring that out, too. The tacos were fine, but the tortillas definitely felt store bought; far below the quality of Paco's, Bakersfield, Cabo, Three Amigos or any other Mexican place in town. 

The waiter never came back to check on us. He seemed to be out of it...not overwhelmed, just completely checked out. I had to shout at the person who appeared to be a manager, partly due to volume, partly because instead of checking on tables or servers, he was just walking around texting on his phone or pouring himself a Coke from the bar (all easily seen from the table we were at). I asked if he was the manager, and he said \"yes.\" I told him I'd like our check, he said \"ok\" and turned around to go get it. He never asked us if everything was ok (hint: if I have to shout at you to get our check - things are not going well) and had the waiter bring the bill. 

We paid and left, amazed that a place with such poor service could survive with as much taco competition as there is in south Charlotte. My guess is the patio. The photos probably speak more than my review. Such a shame, this place has so much potential."}
{"text":"Unique Mediterranean Venue with a lot of seating inside and nice outside area. Address may lead you to the back of the building, but just follow the signs and you will find it. Tacos were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great after work ambience for craft cocktails, but I'd give this place a pass if you're looking for decent Mexican food - the meat is subpar (the beefsteak used in both the rice bowl, burrito and taco was very fatty and chewy) and the spice was lacklustre in all the dishes we tried. Hopefully the food quality improves because it's a great location and the vibe is good."}
{"text":"Very good! Place was slammed so we ended up grabbing seat at the bar. Service was still fairly quick and the bartenders were working like machines. The tacos are Delicious! Good blends of seasoning and ingredients."}
{"text":"The strawberry and blueberry mimosas were very good and only cost $4. I tried the \"I'll Have What She's Having\" and the \"Looking Good Louis\" tacos and I wasn't impressed. The tortillas tasted like they had not touched the grill and came straight out of the packaging. When I tried to lift them off the plate they stuck and broke apart. And has for the fillings inside, the fish was dry. The shrimp was juicy but not seasoned like the photos you see here. Overpriced for average cuisine. The appetizer nachos were okay but well proportioned. I asked for a side of guacamole and that helped. My fiancé tried the steak bowl and he enjoyed it. The waitress was very sweet."}
{"text":"Honestly, it was okay. We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited for our table outside and decided on chips and queso while killing time. As expected after reading the article in Charlotte agenda, the chips are absolutely not fresh fried in house. The queso did come out quickly, so not a total con, but not impressed thus far. We all ordered tacos and enjoyed said tacos very much. Nothing to write home about... Maybe upscale food truck tacos. My girlfriend's side salad was brown and in her words \"a day old salad.\" The service was average at best. In fact, my water glass was cleared before we left the table. The ambiance outdoors was wonderful and it would be a great place for drinks after work if you like the SP scene, but don't make a special trip."}
{"text":"This place is super cute! I really enjoyed the food, I can't wait to go back. I got the stage five clinger and looking good louis tacos which were really delicious. Also, the queso is sooooo good. I've been twice & they have been really busy so the wait was pretty long but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I've had worse service but can't remember when. Food was fair at best. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Overall a terribly bad and disappointing experience. We came for lunch on a Friday afternoon and though the place was almost empty, the service was poor and slow and we barely made it back to work on time. We started with chips and queso, the chips were stale and the queso was bland. We had a total of 5 tacos between the two of us and we thought the steak taco was the best while the rest were not anything impressive. The mahi mahi was way over cooked and the tortillas seemed microwaved and like something from the grocery store. The lettuce on the tacos was soggy and seemed either old or also microwaved for some reason, regardless it was not fresh.

The one star for this place is really only for the ambiance on the patio, though some of the plants looked a little rough and the inside didn't seem particularly clean. Save your money and go to Cantina 1511 down the road for better food and service, plus complimentary chips and salsa."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Charlotte lacks food venues that are well thought out and as much visually interesting as tasty.  I feel like if a restaurant is well thought out and atmospherically pleasing, the food is lacking. Ruru's has both. The atmosphere is a very cool villa that has been transformed for dining and the details down to the square hollowed out ice cubes are way cool! I had the queso, salsa, and guacamole. All a very nice way to start the meal (although everything here is a la carte so do not expect the salsa and chips off the bat) I also tasted the tofu rice bowl which was very fresh tasting. I ordered the skirt steak taco and the mahi taco. Simple and delicious. Great drink selection and clever menu... Before I go on, I must say overall we were pleased with our experience. When We arrived it was Sunday around 6:15 and we sat at the bar as it was completely empty. The bartender seemed a bit agitated and aloof that we were even there. This somewhat bothered me because I was so hungry. After several minutes, he told us he wanted to get our order because he needed to get over to a 6 person table behind us- clearly going to be a bigger tip so clearly higher priority. We got our appetizer Ina very timely manner but we decided to talk to the other bartender for the duration because of what happened next. The original bartender, a tall middle aged bald man, got pissed that the lady at the table behind us had left him a $2 tip. It wasn't enough that he told us... He had to show us the receipt, bitch to the other bartender, and the servers standing at the well. \"I've never received a worse tip\" was something he said and also called the woman a choice name. He did not know us or know that I have been a bartender for over a decade. These things happen. Thales are \"tips\" not mandatory. Also, I understand having a bad night, but I do not agree with discussing a bad tip with anyone let alone customers that you do not know! We would have stayed for many more tasty drinks but we decided to leave because of the absurdity of this situation. Also, I took my normal 30% tip to just over 18%... Which was out of courtesy for the other kind bartender."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places but last night was a complete disappointment. The beer and Jalapeño Infused Margarita were the highlights. Our Queso Dip was just warm but I decided to ignore that. We ordered the Shrimp Fajitas, maybe my expectations were too high, but no sizzling plate. There was no flavor at all to the dish. I rechecked the menu and it did say SEASONED SHRIMP.  My seven shrimp were as white as could be with no sight of seasoning anywhere. My wife couldn't eat it so she ordered the Chicken Burrito. Our daughter had ordered this before and enjoyed it so it seemed like a safe bet. WRONG! Another Luke warm flavorless dish. The ratio of chicken to rice was won by the RICE!  Out of 10......Chicken 2...Rice 8!! I told our waiter Luka who said he would tell the kitchen but I never heard anything more.  I'm sure we will be back, after a while, but it'll just be Tacos!"}
{"text":"I have become Mexican Food obsessed over night it seems like and I am all about Tacos and Tequila lately lol So RuRus has been on my \"To Eat\" list for a while!! 

On my way to Southpark Mall a friend of mine and I stop at RuRus for a late lunch and I could barely walk out because I was full and a little intoxicated ( don't judge me)!

We were very confused and lost at first because we parked in the parking lot of off Providence Rd and could not find a RuRus door with a sign. Walk around people, learn from our mistakes lol.

When we finally found the front door (back door????) we were immediately seated and we started with drinks off the bat! I ordered the Frank the Tank with raspberry and my friend ordered the Say Hello to my Little Friend. WARNING: Frank the Tank is no joke, I asked for more raspberry and still could barely drink it lol if I was going out for the night I would appreciate that drink being so strong! BUT I was going shopping afterwards and I knew it would be a struggle to shop after that drink. Over all the drink is worth the money lol

For appetizers we ordered the Billy Ray Valentine. The queso was really good but a little too runny for my liking. Now for my entrée if I could order every taco and sample them I would've but I chose 2 tacos and my friend ordered 2. For me I had \"I'll Have What She's Having\" and \"It was the Dukes\" I think I made 2 great choices! I loved the grilled Mahi Mahi! My friend had the \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\" and the \"Its Probably Not Even a Crime These Days\". She is an extremely picky eater and all of her tacos. 

After writing this review I'm ready for a taco! See you at RuRu's!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love the ambiance on the patio and the service here is always great. The food is fantastic. This is our go to when we are craving Mexican!"}
{"text":"Coming from California, we were worried about finding delicious tacos, guacamole, margaritas....  RuRu's was an incredible and wonderful surprise. The food and atmosphere were equally delightful. And the banes of the dishes and drinks are so clever I had to take photos of the menu. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Much better experience this go round. Bartender was attentive yet not hovering to much. I had one of their salads with chicken and it was good. We also had the Three Amigos appetizer-guac, salsa, cheese dip with chips. Pretty good although I wish one of them had some heat. Friend had a chicken rice bowl and said it was really good. Beers specials--$2.75 for certain bottled beer. Will return and try their tacos next time. Also seemed to have a decent selection of beers on tap (not really a beer drinker personally) and I noted a nice selection of tequila."}
{"text":"OMG good. 

I haven't had the chance to go to Ru Ru's in person but I have ordered it a few times on a food delivery app. The food quality is above par and the delicious taste is a direct reflection of the quality ingredients used during preparation. The presentation is colorful and makes a big difference in my overall experience with Ru Ru's. 
I'm from California and am pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of Mexican food in Charlotte. I highly recommend it. My favorite items are the Quesadillas."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos.. They came out pretty quick. First time here and the food was on point."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place. The food was good, but overpriced. The margaritas were good, but overpriced. The service was nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"I kept seeing RuRu's on Instagram and the food always looks appetizing so I gave it try on \"National Margarita Day.\"I would rate RuRu's a 3.If you haven't been there before the parking can be confusing as you have to turn on a side street to get to the back of the restaurant to an opened parking lot.The restaurant seems consistently crowded wherein we experienced a 30mins wait.They use a texting system to alert you when your table is ready.Once we were seated,I noticed how there are so many tables in a small area.We were tucked in a corner and really close to our neighboring table.I could hear their whole conversation.It was also extremely loud in there.I remember telling my boyfriend multiple times how loud it was.The menu has a moderate variation of choices to choose from.I ordered a taco with steak but cannot recall the name of it that costed $4,as well as chips and salsa(not complimentary).The food was good,but nothing spectacular.My boyfriend ordered a bowl and he was pleased.We also ordered drinks which were tasty on site;however,I later had a headache.In comparison to Vida Vida/Vida Cantina,I believe RuRu's has better quality ingredients and chips.However,I would probably prefer Vida because of the noise level,space,and etc."}
{"text":"I have no complaints! This place was excellent! We ordered the Three Amigos - great portion size and great taste. 

The Friend Zone margarita was excellent - did not have that fake sour mix taste. Very delicious!

I ordered the Long Duck Dong (my favorite - sweet and spicy steak), Fat Guy In A Little Coat (marinated steak), and the Stage Five Clinger (crispy chicken). I loved all three, especially the first two. The bartender, long brown hair/glasses - super friendly and attentive. 

Service & food was awesome! Will definitely be returning and recommending RuRu's for Taco Tuesday to my friends!"}
{"text":"For the autumn season they are having a drink special on Sunday's. $5 specialty cocktails. Awesome!!! Pleasant staff (even though they all seemed high) great TOFU taco. I ordered two and was satisfied with that. Also be sure to try their famous frozen margaritas. They get you where you want to go"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I went to Ru's. The first was the YELP event which was awesome! Then on a dinner with friends= service was very nice, came at the end so only had a side salad, and the place was busy.
I thought woo-hoo this place is going to become a regular place.
Then the LAST time went during 4pm or so. The place was completely empty and I stayed for 3hrs. I feel bad, the food is amazing and the drinks are too, but without ppl coming in and that the menu is expensive.....don't know if they will last.

Hope they do...."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, awesome patio.  The only thing I can say negative about this place is the parking is a little inconvenient."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere is good. Prices are fair for the area. It's the first Mexican restaurant I've been to that charges for the chips and salsa. The burrito was good but was barely warm inside. Not a place I will be running back to but worth a try."}
{"text":"This has the cutest interior and exterior decor. I had to start off on that because I just love it. The patio outside is so nice. They have a weekend special marg that is good. They don't use a super sour, sour mix which is nice. Their tacos were AMAZING!!! It is in a great location. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio and doggie friendly (they even have water bowls for their furry guests). Don't be shocked not to get free chips and salsa, but they do refill if you get it. I always tend to over eat at Mexican places but at RuRu's the a la carte menu allows me to enjoy what I want without over indulging. My favorite taco is the Korean Beef Taco (aka Long Duc Dong)."}
{"text":"(more like 3.5 stars)

Went here on a recent Saturday evening and walked away stuffed. We showed up around 7 p.m. and the parking situation was a little gnarly but, thankfully, there were spots available on the green patch of grass that's a little further down from their paved lot.

Since it was a beautiful night out, we chose to sit outside at the bar. There was no wait so we grabbed a couple of seats and were greeted promptly. We started out with a margarita (me) and beer on draft (for him). We also ordered guacamole and salsa for our appetizers. The chips are very hearty, just wish they had a little more seasoning/salt.

For our main entrees, I went with the get off my lawn taco and it's all ball bearings rice bowl. He went with the Clarence beeks steak burrito and lookin good Louis taco. My bowl was massive and I ended up having it for three more meals later on in the week (big plus!) The taco was excellent, right amount of heat and flavorful.

I think for my next visit, I'll focus more on the tacos since that's what they're known for."}
{"text":"I loves me some tacos, and a girlfriend and I decided to try out RuRu's after work one Tuesday. She was smart and parked in the back; I followed my GPS and parked in the front, which made it a little tricky to find since it's not well-marked at all from that side. If you're looking at Stagioni on the left, go to the door on the right. We got there around 4:30, and we were the first ones there, so we grabbed a seat at the bar. Unfortunately it was way too hot to sit on the patio, but it looked pretty awesome out there.

We grabbed some drinks ($5 draft for her - Tuesday special, $9 sangria for me) and started with the I Am McLovin' queso and chips. For dinner, I got a It Was the Dukes taco and a Long Duck Dong taco. All the food and my sangria were fine, but nothing was outstanding. However, the ambiance and service were stellar. It was odd to be at a fun, Mexican restaurant with movie names on the menu when the restaurant is so pretty, but we went with it!

I'd definitely come back, but I'm more likely to do it on a nice-weather Wednesday when I can sit on the patio, skip the food, and have a refreshing adult beverage."}
{"text":"Ruru's is a fun restaurant to visit. It has a Latin America decor and random names for all of their food. There's a really cool area in the back by the additional parking. I came here during lunch with a group of coworkers. Service was okay, but not above and beyond. At one point my iced tea cup sat empty for a while.

There is a deal where you buy 2 tacos and get one free so I ordered three tacos. I got the \"Fat guy in a little coat\" which was a steak taco, \"It was the Dukes\" which was a pork belly carnitas and \"Get Off my lawn\" which was a stuffed pepper with shrimp and cheese. I wasn't really amazed by any of them. The steak seemed to lack flavor, but the avocado aioli was great. The pork belly was dry and there was not enough flavor for me. The only one that I enjoyed was the stuffed jalapeno pepper with shrimp. The slaw was flavorful. And the stuffed jalapeno part was good and cheesy. It was fried and I kind of regretted it later in the sense of this is so good It's bad for me. Great atmosphere, but for me the food and service were just okay."}
{"text":"These had to be the best tacos I ever had. The was hittin like a mug! I will be back the shrimp  tacos had me coocoo  for coco puffs! I was like Good lawd these tacos are bussin"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the flavor (or lack thereof) with the food I ordered. The quesadilla was bland, as was the guacamole (which seemed to be nothing more than chopped up vegetables). I ended up taking the guac home and flavoring it myself. Their salsa and queso was decent but nothing special."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Great food & drink list!! Please update your drink menu on here! I had the \"Yes Precious\" drink & I'd love to see what's in it again!!!"}
{"text":"Margarita Monday, Taco Tuesday, Whatever Wednesday...this place is good ANY day! RuRu's sits inside what used to be the Reynolds-Gormajenko Mansion. The villa is beautiful and so is the Mexican food! The food is SO fresh. Not to mention they boast 100 flavors of tequila, so drinks are a must.

Their tacos are fantastic! They've got a nice selection on their menu, where you order them individually. The mahi taco is one of my favorites here -- it is really fresh and refreshingly zesty! I can tell that they pride themselves in using good, fresh ingredients.

There's no way you can come here without getting the guac or cheese dip appetizer. The guac is delicious and full of flavor. The chips are also really good -- not too thick and not too thin.

I also recommend the Fajitas! The steak fajita is made with quality steak and topped with a cilantro sauce, which gives it a little bit of a bite and makes it unique compared to other fajitas I have had."}
{"text":"Great outside patio area! Good margaritas, but mediocre food and very poor service from waitstaff! Drinks at the bar were great, bartender was wonderful! Once we were seated at our table it all went downhill.  Waitress was not friendly, not helpful, borderline rude...ie came and asked us if we were all done eating (our food had not even been delivered yet...she took the order...beyond odd). Several similar things happened through the the evening. Waited forever for entrees. Food was cold and bland once delivered, salad delivered without dressing. Great place to come for drinks and appetizers, but stick with the bartenders and skip the table service....and this was a week night."}
{"text":"Ruru Tacos are very bland, anticlimactic, and just flat out boring. Here's the breakdown:

Taco #1: I asked for a carnitas taco, and there was a layer of chicken on the bottom and pork on top. Who does that? 
Taco #2: The Fried chicken taco was beyond over fried, dry and the chicken pieces were obnoxiously small. It was almost as if they cleaned the bottom of the frier and gave me those pieces. 
Taco#3: I'm never one to order a steak taco, so I don't want to judge too harshly here. Nevertheless, it would have been nice not to take 1 bite and not have any steak left for the rest of the taco. The whole Korean steak idea was good, but that doesn't mean you can skimp on not seasoning your meat. 

All in all, This menu needs to step it's game up. Fall back on the slaw usage on the tacos as well - this shouldn't be the main way to spruce up poorly seasoned meat. One quick tip: if you're calling it guac, actually mix the ingredients together and BREAK DOWN the avocado so it's not technically \"avocado with a side of chopped veggies\" Also, not to mention that I don't know why a taco place doesn't even have the option for rice and beans. 

Lastly, I'm no taco snob/expert, but a side of rice and beans should be a dead given to have on the menu. I was fairly disappointed in this place but I'm sure my business will be given elsewhere. Over & out!"}
{"text":"Very poor service.  Food is too expensive for the lack of quality.  There are much better taco places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by accident when we were planning on Napa Grille. Great patio so relax and drink some wine or tequila (or both). Guac was fresh and chunky. You could tell it was made fresh with big lime flavor. Large variety of tacos to choose from so we chose 6 to share. Fried oyster, Mahi Mahi and fried chicken were our favorites. Skipped dessert and went for 2 Tequilas from the list of 50. Server recommendations were on point and knowledge was good. Music on the patio weekly is a great touch to draw the crowd. We will be back weekly!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I love the al fresco eating. Service left something to be desired. But overall I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Yeesh  I was so hoping this place would be better, but was disappointed. My husband and I took advantage of the beautiful Spring evening and sat on the patio. The atmosphere was very pleasant, but I give Mother Nature credit for most of that. We ordered queso to start with, about the same time as the table next to us. They had theirs within 5 minutes. Meanwhile, a solid 20 minutes passed before we ever saw our server again and she finally went to go check on it. The queso was just ok. We ordered 4 tacos to share - lamb, steak, Korean and pork belly. Again, I found them to be just ok. In general, everything was on the bland side - even the Long Duck Dong (Korean style) taco. Not a lot of flavor definition. Hubby wanted to give their tres leches a shot. I find that to be hit or miss at even the best restaurants, and you guessed it... it was just ok. We finally got the check and our server once again disappeared for what seemed like forever. She returned and apologized because she lost our card for awhile and was frantically searching for it.  Luckily she found it! 

Two stars for nice patio atmosphere and overall ok food. But wow, the service/kitchen needs a LOT of work. I would go back if a group of people wanted to meet up... but we won't go out of our way for another date night."}
{"text":"Returned to RuRus for a Mexican GNO! 

My girlfriends and I ordered the queso, guacamole, and salsa trio. Everything has silly names here- mostly movie inspired. It's very cheeky! 

The trio is ~$15 but seriously a large portion! Their chips are very good and you can tell they are made in house. They aren't overly salted either which is nice. 

I ordered the grilled chicken taco and the grilled mahi taco. Each taco is ~$4 give or take depending on the ingredients. 

The restaurant is beautiful and gives a sort of old world feel. The patio area outside is one of my favorites in CLT. 

Tonight we waited about 30 minutes to be seated for dinner. It was no big deal we sat outside until it started to rain. When we were finally called for our table we waited about 10 minutes before someone came to our table. Service was a little slow to start but our waitress was attentive and sweet. 

These are definitely some of my favorite tacos in CLT. Margaritas next time!"}
{"text":"First time here on a Marg. Monday. I HATE it when we get sat at a two person table in a row of two person tables that are all full even though there are other tables unoccupied all over the patio. It just makes for awkward conversation because all the other tables are right next to you. Honestly not a fan of the crazy entree names, every table around us just ordered what they actually were, but I get the quirky thing they're trying to do I guess. We got the tres amigos, the salsa is good, the queso could have been better if it was actually warm? Got a couple friend zone margs and I'd have to say that after consuming 3-4 each neither of us felt remotely intoxicated...I wonder if they're a little diluted because of the Monday deal? The chicken fajitas were nothing to write home about, super greasy. The fish tacos...the problem with using flour tortillas is that you can't skimp on your fillings otherwise they look extra sparse since the tortilla is larger, which is exactly what happened here, tiny pieces of fried mahi mahi covered in way too much aoli. Our server was great though so that definitely bumped me up stars wise. Like everyone else has said, come have some drinks and queso on the patio and not much more else."}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas, exquisite guacamole and fantastic atmosphere.  Service was great too.  Glad I tried it out and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great spot for some margaritas and tacos on the patio. The margaritas are some of the best I have had in Charlotte. The frozen margs remind me of an island oasis drink machine - very fine texture. 

Tacos are great, but I need 3 for a meal. The house beans are what really shine for me - I order them every time. 

The burritos are also good, nothing mind blowing - but tasty. 

I wish there were some combo entrees - the a la carte menu leaves me hungry or with a steep bill."}
{"text":"This was a spur of the moment lunch as my boyfriend and I just happened to be driving by, but what a great experience it was! The patio was amazing, sunny and comfortable. They had a great selection of brunch drinks and the food was delicious! I loved my tacos I got \"fat guy in a little coat\" and \"I'll have what she's having\" and my boyfriend got a chicken and white bean burrito which unfortunately I cannot remember the name of. The service was a tad slow but they seemed to be busy only on the patio which I'm sure was overwhelming. We will definitely be back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I spent waaaaaaaay too much ($11 including tip) for 2 such scarcely stuffed, mediocre tasting, non locally-sourced tacos. The ambiance and staff was great, but the food was way underwhelming and overpriced."}
{"text":"Strong 4 stars kind of spot.  The outdoor patio situation looks like it would be amazing come the summer months.  Good cocktail menu.  Their tacos are great.  I had a very good sautéed shrimp and fried oyster taco.  Very nice.  Chips and queso was on point.  I look forward to coming back here again."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday for a week!!!! So in love with the ceviche!!! Getting goose bumps just thinkin about it... I typically shy away from vegetarian choices but dared to try the Gaylord Focker taco and was blown away... This is definitely the type of taco joint where you can experiment and try different flavors and food combinations... Tacos make everything better! The empanadas names \" I'm In A Glass Case of Emotion\" taste fresh and flavorful... my favorite taco was \"Fat Guy In A Little Coat\"... #Yummy2MyTummy #JustMelApproved !!!!  i don't care if you're on the other side of town, missed your bus, have a meeting in 1 hour or only a 30-min lunch, YOU MUST GO TO RURU'S!!!!"}
{"text":"I think this place has the best drinks, queso, and outdoor patio in all of Charlotte. The menu is to die for clever with their names and the wait staff was impeccable. I will return without a doubt. 

Also they recommended the stealz app which I have never tried for and I'm now obsessed!"}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients. Had a few different tacos and they were all amazing. The queso dip is incredible- I now crave this stuff. Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"Def on my top 5 list for tacos & tequila here in Charlotte. Cool little place. Chips &salsa or queso, and sides, you pay for and are served family style. Tip: download app \"Stealz\" and get you free chips and salsa. The \"make it rain\" - saving you $5 bucks, you're welcome. Put it towards a margarita instead!  My rating is 4 stars bc there's always a wait and no reservations, small place so you pay the price there. And also bc I wish there were more options, one page menu is normal some places but I just feel like they should have more."}
{"text":"Nice menu with fun names for items. Enjoyed a business lunch there and want to come back for drinks in patio one evening"}
{"text":"Great marguerita and a friendly bar team. Tacos were on point and guacamole was good. I'd recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Over Christmas Break, four friends and I wanted to have dinner at RuRu's. Given the holidays and the size of our party, I decided to make a reservation about 2 weeks in advance.

On making a reservation: No Open Table. You need to call.

On the atmosphere: Maybe it was because of the holidays, maybe because it's a new hot spot in Myers Park - the place was packed. Good thing I made a reservation. The patio is going to be fabulous in the spring...and maybe even give Selwyn a run for it's money.

On the drinks: Three of my friends got margaritas, and they all said the margs were on the sweet side. I really enjoy the smokiness of mezcal, so I opted for the \"I Love the Smell of Napalm\". The drink was perfectly balanced - the rosemary syrup did not overpower.

On the food: Very funny dish names. We started out with \"Three Amigos\". The quest blanco was parked in front of me and I could not stop. I ordered \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\" and \"Long Duk Dong\" with a side of the white beans. Both tacos were delicious. Beans were ho hum. Next time, I'd skip the white beans and get another taco - probably \"Uncle Buck\"."}
{"text":"First time sitting down and having lunch there. I have been before for cocktails and apps at the bar. I couldn't believe they do not serve chips and salsa when you sit down, you have to pay for it. I know its \"Myers Park\" but for the price of the food that they charge they need to give you chips and salsa. I asked for salsa when they served my lunch and I was charged $1.50 for a very small bowl. I dont like to be nickled and dimed and thats what it felt like.

I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was $12.00 and no sides. Expensive for a quesadilla but i will say it was very good. I'm not sure if I will go back. There are several other mexican restaurants that are just as good more food and less expensive."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner on a Sunday night and it was still pretty busy! The patio was too full for our large party (about 10 people), so we sat inside. The doors to the patio were still open, though, so the space seemed open and inviting.  Our waiter was super nice and attentive and had great recommendations for those of us who hadn't been before. We started with the dip trio: guacamole, queso (blanco!), and salsa and all were very tasty. I had the You Talking to Me margarita which is made with jalapeno infused tequila and loved it. It had just enough kick at the end to keep you going back for more without overwhelming your palate. 

When it was time to order, I decided on a tofu taco (Thats Not a Snowflake) and a fish taco (Its Probably Not Even a Crime These Days). The tofu taco was one of the best I've had- great textures and flavors. The tofu is fried in long blocks, so the outside is crispy but the inside definitely still has a \"tofu\" texture which played nicely with the beans and grilled veggies. The fish taco was also fried and had a wonderful sauce but to be honest it wasn't that memorable for me. Everyone else at my table loved their tacos as well, especially the Fat Guy In a Little Coat. Since it was a birthday dinner we got churros and sopapillas to share for dessert. Both were gone in about 2 seconds, but I would have to say the churro wins my vote for best dessert. Our server recommended the tres leches cake as his favorite but the least shareable so I have put it on my list to try next time. 

Overall I would say this is a great place for upscale Mexican food/cocktails. The tacos are a bit expensive but on par with other similar restaurants in the area. I like that they have a lot of vegetarian options and the margarita selection is A+. I would love to come back for a leisurely dinner and some drinks on their beautiful patio this summer."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. Great food and great service. The menu items are all named after movies. Try the steak burrito! We will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend last night and she suggested this place..before meeting her I did my research on Yelp. I'm glad I did because I probably wouldn't have known where to enter. Once I sat at the bar I immediately felt comfortable. It's a very nice and cozy space. They had the game playing. I ordered 2 margaritas and 3 tacos. Everything was amazing. I will truly come back again."}
{"text":"Worst service I've experienced in Charlotte. Took more than 30 min to get wine, in fact didn't see our server for 20 min. I keep hearing that this place can't get it together and clearly after 5 months it still hasn't happened. Stay away, there's many more Mexican spots in the city with better service."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful tacos. I got the fat man taco which was wonderful. Their guacamole and salsa are also spectacular. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"RuRu's used to be my family's favorite place to get together for tacos in Charlotte, but sadly after our last visit we won't be returning for a long time. We (8 of us) came in early on a Thursday evening. It was busy, but not overly so. There was really no reason for our waiter to be so rude, but he was. It took about 20-30 minutes to get our main entrees, however we only received half of the orders. It took a full 10 minutes to get the rest. By this time, those that had already received theirs were done eating. By the time the 2nd half of our table received food the bar area was packed and it was so loud we couldn't hear each other without screaming. Needless to say, we were ready to get out of there."}
{"text":"One of the most bizarre restaurant experiences I've ever had. Tried this place out with a friend for dinner during the week after hearing a lot of good things. As everyone has mentioned the location and ambiance are great - but that's kinda canceled out when you don't get to eat. We ordered margaritas and the tres amigos appetizer. It took awhile to get drinks, but nothing too outrageous. They were alright, but nothing to really write home about. The tres amigos app was definitely the highlight of the night, everything tasted super fresh and had great flavor. Our waiter came over and took our order while we had our appetizer and we both asked for recommendations and ordered a few tacos. Then 30 minutes passed. Then an hour passed. Then without being asked how we were or if we were ready we were brought the check..... we were confused and asked if we weren't getting tacos and our waiter told us he thought we had already ate. He thought we had eaten without bringing anything, taking away anything, or seeing if we liked anything.. He then offered to get the tacos made and comp the tacos for our wait but at this point we had been in the restaurant for almost two hours and my friend needed to leave. We paid for our drinks and appetizer and went on our way. With so many other great options (and far better service) in the area I don't know how this place competes, don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here on New Years for lunch it was me and my friends first time here we had some trouble finding because of how the building is set up but once we walking in we were pleasantly surprised the atmosphere is nice the menu is unique but our waiter did i a good job of explaining it to us the food here is great I ordered three tacos they all were delicious  I will be coming back here"}
{"text":"At least we can all agree that the patio is exceptional.

I wanted to love it here -- I'm always on the lookout for bomb tacos -- but I was underwhelmed by my visit to RuRu's.

Eight of us ladies planned to have lunch at RuRu's for a going away celebration. One of my coworkers wanted to give them a heads up that we would have a group, but she was quickly rebuked with \"we don't accept reservations.\" That's fine, but a \"thanks for letting us know, we'll be ready for you\" would have been pleasant. Not a great first impression.

One of our ladies arrived first and ordered appetizers and waters for everyone. Our server came by, declined to introduce himself, and asked if anyone wanted anything else to drink. I asked, \"do you have any housemade sodas?\" The look he gave me answered my question; a glazed 'does-not-compute' face. Right on. Water's fine.

Menus were on the table. I see that other reviewers generally appreciate the movie references in the dish names, but I have to disagree, even though I'm a big fan of movies. I just feel like such a tool ordering the \"Glass Case of Emotion, One Time at Band Camp, and two Fat Guy in a Little Coat tacos, please.\" 

It's true, chips are not complementary. I've heard here on Yelp that if you order them, your server will keep refilling your chips, but I didn't see that to be true in our case. Salsa, queso, and guac will run you $5, $7, and $8.50, respectively.

Tacos come on flour tortillas by default, but I was happy to see that they can be served on corn tortillas for gluten free diners like me.

Our orders came out quickly and correctly, with most of us ordering three tacos apiece. No one told us which tacos were which, but it's probably for the best, as the names mean nothing. I started with the Lookin' Good Louis (a shrimp taco -- just call it a shrimp taco). It was head and shoulders above my other two choices, the It Was the Dukes (pork belly) taco and I'll Have What She's Having (mahi) taco. My latter tacos were sorely lacking in seasoning. I was especially disappointed by the pork belly; it had all the signature fat of the cut but without any sear or sauce. Just greasy, shredded pork.

Our check situation was a little confusing, with one person picking up all the appetizers and another paying for three people, but cards and receipts were charged and returned smoothly.

Languid service, bland proteins, and a lame menu leave me with two stars. My search for decent tacos in the Queen City continues."}
{"text":"I came here today with a friend and my son for lunch. This is a place I wanted to try out based on reviews on Yelp, so I thought I would give it a try. Parking was a little tricky at first to find but that was based on me bypassing the sign that told me where to park. There wasn't any real designated parking spaces, so thank God it was not busy because people were parking crazy lol. The outside patio was really nice, however we opted to sit inside. Our waitress was.....(I'll get on that later). We ordered the \"this is Sparta \" nachos as an appetizer which were good. I ordered the Gaylord Focker and Stay off My Lawn tacos. The Gaylord Focker although having an interesting description did not quite satisfy my taste buds. The other taco was great! My friend had the Gaylord Focker as well with the grilled mahi taco(can't remember the name). He also felt the same about the Gaylord Focker taco. It was completely vegetarian which I prefer, but the taste was weird. My son had a cheese quesadilla that he enjoyed. ***Back to the waitress*** She was very nice, but she was not attentive and very forgetful. She did not seem new so I could not excuse her. She basically caused a three star review from her lack of attentiveness. We waited 15 minute intervals in between seeing our waitress, which was annoying when we needed things. The restaurant wasn't busy either. I also provided her with a Yelp coupon for buy 2 get 1 free tacos during lunch which she said they accepted, yet I did not receive the discount. Since I knew I would probably wait 10-15 before I saw her face. I left cash and paid the amount on the receipt without the discount. I was a little disappointed in the service and food."}
{"text":"- great space...I imagine it gets pretty fun in the summer on their back patio 

- tacos are all named after movies...kind of cool 

- interesting flavor combinations, but the taste didn't knock my socks off. I thought the tacos tasted just okay 

- waiter was a little over the top/pushy. kind of a turn off 

- worth giving it another shot, despite the service that rubbed me the wrong way and the prices being a tad too high"}
{"text":"We ventured to RuRu's this evening on our way to visit the Mint Museum. I love the old Spanish style building, the stucco, red tiles, bright umbrellas on the patio...reminds me of my days in Miami in Coral Gables. The menu was simple which was nice because some Tex-Mex places go overboard with their offerings. We started with the chips and salsa. The chips were warm, salsa was chunky and flavorful. If you're dining with little people like I tend to, the salsa is kid friendly but packs a nice flavor. For dinner, my kids ordered tacos and a quesadilla which were generous in size. The kids meals include a drink...the quesadilla was $5 and the tacos were 2/$6. I ordered three tacos ($4-$4.75 each) and my husband ordered a rice bowl (about $9) My tacos could have been more flavorful and they would have tasted better on corn tortillas. The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back sans kids for a date night because the drink menu looked amazing. Next time I'll order the rice bowl (It was so good!)"}
{"text":"Dined here with my husband and daughter for a casual Saturday early dinner. We sat on the patio, which was pretty cool. Ambience was great. I'm giving 3 stars for the food, I thought it was just ok. I had the grilled mahi taco and the sautéed shrimp taco. We also ordered the white beans and rice... no flavor what so ever! We also ordered the queso and guacamole which were also just ok. I just wasn't really impressed.  I don't think I'd return ever..."}
{"text":"This wonderful Myers Park taqueria has one of the best patios in Charlotte, with a great outdoor bar and lots of natural shade. But whether you dine inside or out, you'll enjoy some outstanding Tex-Mex dishes, solid margaritas, and friendly service. 

On a recent Friday evening, we grabbed an outdoor table, ordered a couple of drinks, and settled in for a terrific meal. The chips and salsa we started with were crunchy and delicious, though a bit pricey. The margaritas were tasty, but small -- and could've used just a bit more tequila.

The taco selection is extensive, with names that will make cinemaphiles smile: 'Stage Five Clinger,' 'I'll Have What She's Having,' and 'Those Aren't Pillows'. I ordered the Korean-style 'Long Duck Dong,' which was just OK, and the steak taco 'Fat Man in a Little Skirt,' which was outstanding. My wife also really enjoyed her fried chicken taco, and the Kids Taco was tasty enough to get a few bites out of my always fussy six-year-old.

We really enjoyed our first visit to RuRu's, and will definitely be coming back again. There are better Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, but none that serve up the great outdoor dining experience you can find here."}
{"text":"Almost drove by it. Tricky to find. Nice, trendy spot, beautiful decor. Met a friend for dinner. Lots of options to choose from. I ordered the Long Duck (?), the Louisville something and the Uncle Buck. All of the tacos are named after movies? Characters? I also had 2 margaritas- Friend Zone and Magic Mike. Magic Mike was the better of the two. Our server was very flat and unenthusiastic. I especially didn't like that he started to clear our table before we were both done eating. Probably in the hopes that we would finish up and leave so he could get another table. The tacos were good tho but pricey. And, they charge you for the chips and guacamole (I understand charging for guac but chips?) My tab was $37!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place!

We went here on a whim early one Saturday night, and we weren't disappointed!  The atmosphere was really cool, and our waitress was very kind and genuine with great recommendations.

We ordered several tacos and apps, and the crispy fried chicken, shrimp, fried oyster, and carnitas tacos were our favorite.  I don't know what they put in that zesty sauce, but it's perfect! I also really liked the balance and texture of the different toppings on each taco. I'd also recommend ordering the special queso to go with the tacos, because isn't everything better with cheese sauce to dip it in?!?

Oh, and the WINGS--- you absolutely have to order the wings!! My husband and I are big foodies, and I have to say, these are the best wings we've ever had.  (I know, weird considering this is supposed to be a Mexican place lol).  The slight crispy texture, the sweet and yet spicy glaze sauce, and the horseradish crema on top were just phenomenal!

Their version of Guac was really the only thing I wasn't a fan of, but other than that, a flawless experience!"}
{"text":"Food was OK but not great. Wall to wall 20-somethings appearing to be dating and connecting with friends."}
{"text":"Our server was amazing.  The food was palatable   But i had THREE margaritas with a premium tequila.....and was not yet buzzed.   Why uber if there is no liquor in the drinks."}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced. I got two tacos, didn't like one and they didn't offer to change it or take it off my bill. Also you have to pay for chips and salsa or sign up for a stupid app and post a picture of your chips and salsa and you get it free. I've been once and won't be returning. The outside seating area looks nice and is popular but not nearly enough parking available."}
{"text":"We love RuRu's! It's our go-to. The atmosphere is great, the food is so good! I always get the rice bowl! The menu is hysterical. When it's nice out, I suggest sitting outside on the patio. It's very pretty and there's a bar outside. I'm all about their local craft beers!"}
{"text":"Food is always delish!  Service, however, has either been just okay or just awful.  The food is so good I keep going back anyway."}
{"text":"I usually avoid anything less than four stars, but my friends assured me this place was great.  The service was stellar, and my tacos were nothing short of amazing.  We practically fought over the last bit of queso.  And for the people whining about the charge for salsa, relax!  Just buy some salsa if you want salsa."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love your food.  However, today is second time your employees neglected customers on the patio.  The weather is gorgeous and there's not a single person at your inside bar so you should have your outside bar staffed!  You had a patio full of diners but no one waited on me at the bar.  I politely stop a server and say \"can you have the bartender take my order?\" Oh sure and just like last time I was neglected, again today she explains the bartender must run between outdoor and indoor bars.  Yeah ok but there's not a single person at indoor bar!!! You have 4 patrons outside - it's a beautiful Carolina day!  I wait for 10 more minutes and say screw it, I'm hungry I'll eat at indoor bar.  As I walk in bartender goes I was coming out.  Nevermind I'll eat inside.  Then he's got a chip on his shoulder the whole time.  I was polite and left a decent tip but you need your hostess and her boyfriend/ coworker to get their heads out of their butts and notice who needs service on the patio instead of cooing over one another, reading texts, and discussing their college courses.  They are oblivious!!!"}
{"text":"The location is the only special thing about this place. They have a great patio and nice interior. The drinks and food are just average, at best. Beer selection isn't great and our waitress couldn't even tell us half the draft selections. We got a, \"Uh... there's a pumpkin beer. I'm not sure where it's from.\" All the food was very bland."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the reviews. I've been here at least a dozen times and have never been disappointed. The atmosphere is just as awesome as the food. I love being able to order just one taco at a time and sampling them all! Their drinks are hands down some of the best in the area. They also offer brunch which is just as good at their regular menu!"}
{"text":"Hard to find but you'll eventually find your Waze. Loved the outdoor patio with live music on Wednesday. Great ambiance minus all the bugs flying in our face. Food on the other hand was okay. We got the Billy Ray Valentine queso which according to the description was loaded with chorizo and cilantro. It wasn't loaded especially for $9. The salted tortilla chips were good though. Ordered the Long Duck Dong (Korean style steak) and the I'll Have What She's Having (mahi mahi). The steak taco was good but the mahi mahi was way overcooked. We also got the Death by RuRu burrito (pork belly carnita). I'm not sure if it's called that because it's spicy or because if you eat too many you'll die from obesity. It was good and spicy. Wish it had some veggies in it though so I could feel like I was eating somewhat healthy."}
{"text":"Probably the best \"hidden\" patio in the Queen City, RuRu's has a lot going for it.  It's just a matter of getting there.  You can see it off the road, but the parking lot is a bit tricky as  you have to whip around the block and park.  I noticed while eating that people came in all disoriented since the host table is located at the back door where the patio is, so if you come in the front door you have to traverse the entire restaurant to see the hostess and get seated.

Food is solid... servers are friendly... however a bit slow.  It's fine if you aren't pressed for time, but when the dining room is half full and you have to flag someone down to get refills and the check, it's a bit disconcerting.

The food has some memorable names and you can tell the kitchen has some creative juices flowing back there.  The main draw would be the tacos, but they have other offerings:  quesadillas, burritos, salads, and rice bowls.  Something for everyone.

Great location in Myers Park, however you need to find it.... If you live in the neighborhood, it's probably best to walk here.  I haven't tried to ride a bike here, but then again I haven't seen any bike parking close-by."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I checked out this hidden gem this past Sunday! The patio is amazing and the umbrella's came in clutch when it started to sprinkle.  We missed the brunch menu this time so we'll have to come earlier next time but the food was still outstanding. I got a chicken quesadilla and my friend got two tacos. We also split chips n salsa & queso (which was to die for)  The drink selection is really where it's at though! With clever names inspired from cult movie classics and $5 drink specials daily, RuRu's is quickly becoming my new favorite Mexican spot! The only negative thing I have to say is that the service was a little slow --- but I also realize that we were the only table on a rainy Sunday afternoon and that we were seated out of view of the waitstaff. Regardless, I'll still be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. It's in a great neighbor hood and the outside patio with its own bar is awesome.  We came in and got one of the community tables by the bar so we could watch the game.  

I got the Feeling good Louis and the whatever the shrimp one was.  So crispy chicken and the shrimp.  Both were great.  My boyfriend had the it was the Dukes and the ill have what she's having.  We both didn't care for the Dukes because it was too crispy.  

Also had the wings as an app and they were pretty good. Service is decent.  Came at 6pm and the place was starting to fill up.  May need a reservation if coming later.  

Def will come here on a nice sunny day to sit outside."}
{"text":"I think the taco's here are very expensive.  They have good flavor, but c'mon.  They have real queso blanco here though, so I will eat more of that.

The staff is super-amazing though.  They are friendly and helpful.

The restaurant is large, so plenty of seating and good for groups.  The bar is good-sized as well.  The patio is the hip place to be in this area of Charlotte and it's a very nice patio with a separate bar.  The bar outside is covered, but the seating is not.  

Parking here is interesting.  The front lot gets filled up quickly as it is super small and large SUV's like to take up all the spots.  The parking behind the building is much easier to get in and out of but harder to find if you don't know where to look.  

Overall a decent place for drinks and some chips and queso blanco."}
{"text":"The restaurant was a little hard to find from the back but the patio has a great atmosphere and is pet friendly. The frozen margarita was extra cold and perfect for a summer night. A great spot for date night or a big group of friends."}
{"text":"My daughter did it again. She took me here b for my birthday and I was so pleased. The Margarita was to die for it was so smooth great blend of tequila and margarita mix it was just a very good margarita. The tacos that I ordered I was extremely happy with I ordered \"this isn't the Duke\" which has pork belly red cabbage and it was so good, and I ordered two \"why so serious\" which was a very good taco as well I am pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Like their top margarita drink but the problem is they serve it in a small glass which is a lot different from other margaritas you get. Food is good and porch has a nice feel."}
{"text":"Love this place! This new restaurant is set in a Spanish villa and has a fun and classy ambiance! There is a huge patio complete with small firepits and an outdoor bar.  There is plenty of parking available as well. 
The menu is Tex-Mex. There are plenty of delicious vegetarian options. Everything is reasonably priced, and the food is delicious. Would DEFINITELY recommend the Calamari as a starter. This is probably one of the best versions of calamari I have ever had. The guacamole, salsa, and cheese are pretty good, not the best. The tacos are delicious!
They serve beer, wine, and cocktails. They have a very creative and interesting cocktail list. 
Great ambiance, delicious food, great drinks, and reasonable pricing. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"LOVE the drink and taco names on the menu, they're brilliant. Additionally, the mahi tacos were very solid!"}
{"text":"Great food! Very entertaining menu, food ambience and great cocktails! A very nice evening spent here! Rey the organic brown rice bowls and taco combinations !"}
{"text":"As a native Texan when I see a spot that pops up as a Tex-Mex restaurant I get excited but I'm also very skeptical as well knowing there aren't two many good Tex-Mex spots outside of Texas. 

Parking is a bit of a pain but that's pretty much Charlotte in general. I will say the patio is very cool and would be a great happy hour spot. But let's get to the food. First of all any Tex-Mex, Mexican restaurant should always have chips and salsa for a table, which RuRu's does not. To me this is a huge no no. Also I think any dish should come with rice and beans. But the Tacos are all al a cart but if you order at least two they give you a small side with them. I order black beans and to say small side is putting it lightly. It was literally about a two bite portion. Now don't get me wrong I'm cool with the al a cart taco option but they should also have a taco plate option that comes with rice and beans. Now to the actual Tacos, I ordered a Long Duck Dong(Korean style steak) and a Fat Guy In a Little Coat(steak taco), while I loved the play on movie lines for taco names I can't say the same for the actual tacos. I thought they were pretty bland and left a lot to be desired. 

I really had high hopes but was quite disappointed. I would possible recommended going and hanging on the patio for drinks and maybe an app but as for the Tacos I'd pass."}
{"text":"Went here for a work dinner on a weeknight and the place was packed. Got some drinks at the bar and they were a little disappointing. The sangria was too syrupy and so was the margarita. Neither had much of an authentic Mexican flavor. Waited about an hour for a table. Service was really good and the food was good, too. The mahi fish tacos with chipotle aioli were stellar. Nice little kick to the sauce. The steak tacos were not as good. Really lacked flavor in the meat and the sauce. I'd eat the fish tacos again but pass on the other items I tried."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of both Tacos and Tequila so I was stoked to finally hit RuRu's for dinner!  

My bride and I went on a Thursday evening and had the Three Amigos trio (Salsa/Guacamole/Queso) and a couple margaritas for the first round.  We then dove into the 'It Was The Dukes\", \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\", \"Looking Good Louis\", and \"Long Duk Dong\".  

Overall it was pretty good but I'd say a tick expensive for what you get.  Our bill with tip was over $80.  The Three Amigos trio was wonderful but enough for 4 people.  The \"Looking Good Louis\" was our favorite taco as the others seemed to lack seasoning and depth.

I wouldn't say they are the best taco option but if you are in that area and want a wonderful vibe with a great bar, give it a shot!  The margaritas are $9.75 but quite the upgrade if you want better tequila.  The shot of Don Julio Reposado was $14 so quite steep compared to other places like ... other local taco/tequila options.  I would rate 3.5 stars so I'll round up and visit again for final thoughts."}
{"text":"Making it a personal mission to try every Taco Tuesday in the city. Stay tuned. I was impressed with how big this place was, I feel like I have only seen pictures of the patio (which must be awesome when its warm). We sat at the bar, they had some good beer specials. True to form, we came for $2 tacos and ended up getting nachos and drinks which ended up being a $40 meal. Wouldn't get the nachos again. They were fine just not amazing. But speaking of amazing, the buffalo chicken tacos were sooo good! I even ordered another after I was already full. I think they must rotate what tacos are on special every week, because it was mahi and buffalo chicken this time. The mahi were good too, just not as good as the buffalo chicken. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A carnivore, seafood lover and vegetarian walk into a taco shop...and all leave happy! This place was delicious! Loved the atmosphere although we had trouble finding the entrance haha. Our server was attentive and had great suggestions for the tacos. I went with my mom and sister and we all enjoyed our meals. We started with chips and salsa, guac and queso. All three were a hit. I think we had almost every taco on the menu except the pork and salmon? The tacos are small and only a few bucks, so it's cheap to try a variety. Two filled us up with the appetizer although I was tempted to force a third because they were so good. Jeff, the bartender is awesome, so if you wanna hang at the bar and grab a bite, ask for him!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now! 

Parking-a little confusing and can be hard to find. We pulled in the front to the villa area and had to leave to go to the back to find their actual parking area. Front of the restaurant is beautiful. Patio area is nice and would be awesome once the weather is more warm! 

When we walked in we were greeted and the hostess got two menus and stood behind us and told us we could sit wherever we want. A little strange since me and my fiancé had never been we weren't really sure where to go. You first walk by the bar area and the kitchen is exposed to the other side. We walked into the room where the stairs were and sat at a booth. Decor is nice. 

We ordered chips and salsa which were $5. The salsa was good and in a large bowl. Chips weren't that warm. They were more on the thicker side which I like but my fiancé didn't care for it since he likes thin and crispy chips. 

I got the Korean taco and it was good. Steak was tender and I love the sesame seeds in it. Shrimp taco was probably my favorite. The sauce in it was creamy and went well with the shrimp. I also got the chicken taco. It was good and safe. Nothing special about it. 

I would come here again. They are a little pricey for what it is but I do like the style and how you can pick different individual tacos."}
{"text":"Hidden little spot with great atmosphere. Only had appetizers, but awesome sauce! Queso is great, guacamole fresh as is salsa. Chips are homemade. We were there early afternoon - only patrons really. Staff was busing getting prepared so service wasn't great, but it's a spot you'd definitely return to again!"}
{"text":"This is a cute taco place! Nice up-scale Tex-Mex take on tacos. They have other items like burritos and Nachos. Unfortunately, they did not have any enchiladas. They have amazing queso and salsa. The salsa is extremely fresh and a bit spicy. They have a great selection for tacos and margaritas. I had the Magic Mike margarita (they call it their skinny margarita) and I had two tacos. I had the \"stage five clinger taco\" as well as the \"I'll have what she's having\" both were very good! Overall experience was great; however, our server could have done a better job. She was un-aware of us for the majority of the time."}
{"text":"Ruru's caught my eye in the winter of 2015. Since I had been hibernating, I didn't make it out here until the yelp event in April. On an unseasonably warm day, Yelp hosted an event on the patio. The food was good and the drinks were strong. I couldn't wait to come back. It was an all around good time.

Our second visit to Ruru's happened a couple weekends ago. The weather was starting to turn to fall and we came in to celebrate. We sat on their beautiful patio and shared a couple plates. The patio was bustling with people, lots of groups, tvs were on, seemed like a great atmosphere. Like another reviewer said - the queso is good but runny. I would order it again. I ordered 3 tacos, but only 2 arrived and I was only charged for 2 - I tried one of the steak ones (gristly) and one of the carnitas (seemed cooked, chopped, and re-fried on a flat top). I got a side of guac which was watery for some reason - maybe because of the tomatoes in it? Not a fan. Fiance got both chicken tacos and the mahi taco. He seemed to like his more than I liked mine. We each ordered a cocktail and on Sundays they are half price which was a plus. Cocktails were good and strong - no watered down drinks here just because they were running a special. Our server was very nice but we had to ask him several times for napkins which should be a default table setting at a place where you eat with your hands. And whatever happened to my third taco? 

Overall, I want to love Ruru's but I can't. The concept is cool and the patio is nice but the food could be better."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte! Always so fresh! Love the outdoor seating & patio bar."}
{"text":"How is this place only 3 stars?  Last night was definitely a five star experience all the way.

There's ample parking behind the restaurant, which takes a bit to find but it's there.  The patio is easily one of the best in Myers Par with it's tree covered canopy, outdoor bar, firepits and yard lights.  This is easily a place you could spend a few hours having drinks and enjoying the weather. 

Monday-Wednesday have drink specials so I had some strawberry and mint margarita.  It was delicious, just strong enough and only $5!!!  What????

The queso and chips were on point and so were the tacos.  Sure, some won't like that the names of the tacos are taken from movie quotes but who cares.  The Stage 5 Clinger, Looking Good Louis, I'll Have What She's Having, and the Long Duk Dong were incredible. I recommend getting a bunch and sharing as we did.    

Best of all, it wasn't a budget buster.  I've been places, paid a lot more and regretted my meal. This is one I definitely plan to frequent this summer, especially out on the patio."}
{"text":"The food and service was ok. The worst thing about the whole experience was that after waiting for a table for more than 40 mins., they sat us by the bathrooms where the smell was horrible and when asked to be seated at the empty booth across from the table we were at, the hostess said they were reserving it for a bigger party! I ordered some tacos which didn't come with any sauce so I asked for a side of salsa not knowing that it would be a $1.50 extra. I think the server should have mentioned it. We might come back to give it another shot but this place is not on the top of my list."}
{"text":"Great place for live music on a Wednesday. Enjoyed the ambience, with outdoor seating and an option to sit inside the restaurant.

We ordered the queso dip w chorizo (very small portion with not enough chorizo), death by ruru burrito (crispy pork belly carnitas), fat guy in a lil coat taco (marinated steak), and the white beans.

The server gave a disclaimer that the death by ruru is really spicy which we were excited about since we're from la and enjoy spicy Mexican food. But it wasn't spicy AT ALL. The food we had was good but not worth the price points. Was surprised with how pricey tacos and burritos are here."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad. The cocktail I got (\"You're Killing Me Smalls\") was really good and well worth the $10. The queso dip with the chorizo was really good too (they don't do complimentary chips and salsa here) I had a shrimp taco, a fried oyster taco and a Korean steak taco...all of which weren't bad....but after having the Korean BBQ pork taco from Pinky's last night for half the price, I probably would've traded that last one. 

Also coming off the heels of Pinky's, the service was pretty subpar here. The hostess wasn't particularly friendly. Our waitress (Katie) was somewhat attentive at first and then after we got our food (which someone else brought), she checked on us once and then completely disappeared for about 30 minutes...I sat with an empty water glass for the better part of my meal...and we we sat at our table for like 15 minutes after we finished , waiting for our check. 

Somehow our check was about $65 for two people and it didn't feel like anything out of the ordinary. Bottom line, if I came here again it would probably just be to have a specialty cocktail and an appetizer."}
{"text":"Really cute place!! We went for taco Tuesday, they had OK deals. Tacos were solid, not anything super special though. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite thing about this place is the menu. Every item is named after something movie related. Movie lines, characters, etc. I love it.

The location is a little confusing. It is on the back side of the building on 715 Providence. So if you park out front (where you'll see Toccare and Stagioni), walk around to the back of the building. You'll see the big patio and also a parking lot there. 

So, let's start with that big 'ole patio. I cannot wait until it warms up outside. It looks like a great place to hang out and to have drinks.

This is not one of those restaurants where you sit down and a server automatically brings you chips and salsa. If you want them, you have to order and pay for them. Instead of salsa, I order the Billy Ray Valentine. It's like cheese dip on steroids.... a queso with chorizo, corn relish and pico. I usually get two tacos and a side of the creamy white beans. Tacos range from $3.50-$4 and you can add a side for $2. So if you go the taco route, you'll spend about $10 for your meal. So far I've had: \"I'll Have What She's Having\" (grilled mahi-mahi), \"Uncle Buck\" (fried oysters) and \"Fat Guy In A Little Coat\" (grilled skirt steak). I've liked them all so far. 

I haven't had anything from the cocktail list yet. I'm excited to try their version of a spicy margarita. Last night, they had $5 white sangria on special. I'm not the biggest sangria person, but hey when in Rome right? Or should I say Mexico?

The staff have all been nice. Service has been a little hit or miss. I think they're still feeling things out since they are fairly new."}
{"text":"I recently visited RuRu's for dinner with coworkers, and I had a really enjoyable experience.

First, the atmosphere at RuRu's is awesome. It's decorated like a Latina villa inside and has a great exterior seating area that was well-heated and that had a bar. We had great service by the hostess and waiter when they accommodated special seating needs in our party.

My party shared their trio of dips with chips to start. I really liked their salsa because it had the perfect amount of authentic heat to it. The queso and guac were solid, and all the ingredients tasted very fresh.

I ordered two tacos for my main dish. The \"Get Off My Lawn,\" a shrimp stuffed jalapeno with Asian slaw, was a unique take on a taco and was nicely executed. I also ordered the \"That's Not Snowflake\" taco, which is easily the best vegetarian taco I've ever had. Instead of a sad serving of lettuce, pico, and cheese, this special snowflake brings you perfectly crisped tofu with a really divine chipotle sauce. In a world full of tacos, I really thought RuRu's stood out in this department.

Overall, the restaurant had a fantastic atmosphere and good tacos at a good price. While I didn't order a drink, it looked like they had good weekly specials and would love to come back to have a marg on the patio when the weather warms up!"}
{"text":"Nice place and awesome patio. Environment is better than the food. Drinks and staff are doing a good job but again, food is nothing better than average...,,"}
{"text":"Great food but service was very sub-par. Almost always had to ask for our waiter (Jonathan) who seemed very uninterested in his job and was extremely awkward, which made us very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The food that we ordered and actually received was wonderful, but there was large component of our meal that was never received. We didn't get our cocktails until after our meal had arrived, and our server was completely M.I.A for the majority of our dining experience. Overall we will go back to give Ru Ru's another opportunity, hopefully the service will dramatically improve!"}
{"text":"I would come here all the time, but the food inconsistencies, spotty service , and frankly the charging for chips and salsa is so deliberately hostile and offensive to patrons it is not worth it.  I'd rather go somewhere where the customer is appreciated and is a priority, not a combatant."}
{"text":"I love that the menu items are all names based from movies. Its a fun places but and the food is always great which also means that it is often quite crowded. The Fish tacos are the best and a must have! Love coming here and always eating way too much!"}
{"text":"I swore I'd never go back but a friend wanted to go for her birthday so I got sucked into the group-thing. I tried to accept with a fresh frame of mind. 
I knew better than to order a Margarita this time as orange juice margs don't do it for me, so a simple glass of wine was fine. We ordered queso for the table. Tasteless and runny. 
No one raved about their dinners and lots went back when the table was cleared. I got a taco that I ate because I was quite hungry at the end of the workday, but anything would have done the trick. Please close this place so another better restaurant can take over this great patio space."}
{"text":"This was definitely the worst burrito I have ever had.  I give them a 2 star rating because of the atmosphere and the chips and salsa (that we had to pay for...ridiculous) were okay. Now I will say this place is extremely popular so I did expect it to be pretty good.  Also, their outdoor setting is really pretty.  Service was very slow so don't expect to get your food in a decent amount of time. For an appetizer we got the three amigos. The salsa, guacamole, and queso, they were okay, nothing special.  Moving on to the food.  I got the chicken burrito and it was extremely disappointing.  If you've ever tried the lime Tostito chips with the fake overwhelming lime flavor, that is exactly what my burrito tasted like but more limey and more fake.  I think it was the rice and the beans that was soaked in fake lime.  Also, I was charged $36 for a margarita pitcher.  Even at the most expensive Tex-mex and Mexican restaurants (including in New York) I have never seen margarita pitchers priced so ridiculously.  Oh and the pitcher was probably the size of a large drink at McDonald's filled with tons and tons of ice.  It may be a good place to hang out, but I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Margaritas were good but overpriced for the serving size. Duck dong taco was fabulous as was the Greek lamb taco. Shrimp taco was lacking in shrimp. Guacamole was great"}
{"text":"Soooo we both wanted to try something new so we picked this place. Let's start with something good first...service was great! We could choose where we wanted to sit and instead of going with the main dining room we chose the seclusion of the booths upstairs. Bad choice cause it was freezing! LOL. For drinks I went with the frozen strawberry something and I could barely sip anything out of the straw. When it said Frozen it meant FROZEN!

For my entrée I went with the quesadilla's which were super boring and probably the most bland I've ever had. Get the taco's instead. Those were pretty good. For dessert we shared the tres leche cake. Totally could have done without the strawberry like frosting on top. All in all just a so so experience. To me for the quality of food we got the bill seemed a little pricey for two people. Good $5 craft cocktail specials though were a good deal."}
{"text":"First off, where are you supposed to park? We found a spot in the back in a tiny parking lot, which then put us in the back entrance of the restaurant which is set up like a long narrow house. We had a group of 7 - and they put us in what I guess would be the living room with bookshelves, a fireplace and a few small tables. Which is unique, but where are we supposed to eat? 

I ordered a $10 margarita - it was ok. A little tart for my liking. And we all shared the trio which was guac, queso & salsa. This would have been better to share if we were sitting at a table! We all ordered some tacos and honestly no one was impressed! They were fine, but Ive had better. The prices were a little on the high side so not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Our first visit tonight, on a Thursday evening. We sat outside in the beautiful courtyard and ordered a house maguerita and a draft beer. Our server was prompt and pleasant."}
{"text":"Loved the indoor and outdoor atmosphere of this place, although it's a little tricky to even know it is there and where to park. I get tired of typical mexican places and this one was definitely different to me. Had chips and queso with two fish tacos. They were great."}
{"text":"Good service. The food was ok but way over priced. Spent $12 dollars on a salad that left me wanting more. My wife got 2 tacos, fried oyster and mahi mahi. The oyster taco only came with two oysters in it and the mahi mahi taco was skimpy as well. Probably will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars because the overall atmosphere and outdoor patio are what make this restaurant great. The food, however, is not great. If you're looking for good Mexican cuisine, this is not your place. If you're looking for somewhere with a good atmosphere to go have drinks and chips with friends, then it is."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the awesome plates (literally the dishes- they are gorgeous) and the tasty queso, guac, chips and salsa. Everything else we ate last night was really mediocre at best. Unfortunately at the price point that's really unforgivable. Things that were bad: rice in rice bowls was undercooked, service was super slow from kitchen and bar (I get it, its a big and busy restaurant - so make your staffing such that people don't want 25 minutes on a margarita), speaking of margarita, our table ordered a few and they were very inconsistent and not tasty. Disappointing overall."}
{"text":"Really good place! I'm glad other people talked about the parking situation or I never would've found it.

They have different specials every night... I went last night so it was margarita Monday and the margs were four dollars off (so $5 instead of $9). We got the guacamole and it was very tasty. The \"I'll have what she's having \"tacos were very good as well."}
{"text":"This was a great brunch spot. I was with a group of five people including kids for brunch around 12 PM there were other families with kids as well about the same time. We had prompt service very good I had an appetizer including guacamole cheese and salsa. Everyone had their own dishes mostly tacos and Burritos. The drinks were good as well lots of choices for margaritas and a heavy tequila pour. I would come back to this place very cool atmosphere with a Italian style building."}
{"text":"3.5 to be exact. The first issue is getting into Ruru's. There are several business signs on the front of the building, but it's not clear where to enter. There's a random door that says \"open\". It looks like the door for a jewelry store, but you can in fact go to Ruru's through this entrance. I was seated immediately. They don't comp chips and dip, which is bad for the consumer, smart for business because we're just going to buy the chips and salsa anyway. I ordered a grilled chicken taco and a shrimp taco. Like everything on the menu, they had some sort of name that reflected Ruru's theme. I thought the menu could've stood to be more straight forward. The upside to Ruru's is that the food was really good. My drink was weak for $9. I would skip having drinks here. Service is good. Overall, decent experience and I'll be back.

My friend, who is a vegetarian, ordered a steak burrito, subbing steak for tofu and no price adjustment was made."}
{"text":"Love the food and the vibes and margaritas. Every time I've ordered a frozen strawberry margarita, I've had to send it back because it's impossible to sip through a straw. Other than that- love it here!great date night spot, too"}
{"text":"My dad and I go get tacos every weekend and when I heard about RuRu's I knew it had to be our next spot. We went on Sunday for lunch and it was the perfect time, not too crowded and attentive service.

First thing, the menu is riddled with movie quotes and characters and it took us 10 minutes just laughing at all the famous lines before we even started looking at what each one actually was. We started with the Three Amigos, salsa, guac and queso. The salsa was amazing and fire roasted but the real winner here was the guac, it had so much flavor and I couldn't get enough! We were both drawn to the Friend Zone margarita which was refreshing with the orange juice and lime juice, so  naturally we ordered two rounds. 

Finally and most importantly the tacos. The \"Long Duk Dong\" was a favorite, korean beef was tender and so flavorful. \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\" was also a great taco with the grilled skirt steak. There are so many more tacos on the menu and I want to try them all. Can't wait for my next visit to RuRu's!"}
{"text":"I've been to RuRu's twice now and really enjoyed both visits. Both the interior restaurant and the patio are just beautiful. The half price margaritas on Monday were a pleasant surprise! The queso is delicious, and the tacos may look small but are surprisingly filling and very flavorful. The service was pleasant both times, no complaints. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had a recent girls night here and I left with mixed emotions. I had never heard of this place and was excited to try it. We started with the sangrias and none of us really liked them. My friends switched to margaritas, which they said were much better. 

We shared the three amigos as an appetizer and we were underwhelmed. We liked the queso, but not the salsa (tasted store bought) or the guacamole (which was really just chopped up avocado). The chips weren't particularly good either. We didn't finish any of it. 

For the meal, I went with tacos. I ordered the stage five clinger, fat guy in a little coat, and looking good louis. When I ate these, the stars aligned and RuRus had kind of redeemed itself. I loved the tacos and would order those again. My friends got the burritos and they liked them. 

In conclusion, I will be back but only for the tacos."}
{"text":"Upon entering, the patio is incredible!  I Once the temperature warms up, that will be one serious hot spot.  It's all set in a gorgeous 1920's villa, and it visually does not disappoint.  The music was slightly a buzz kill (Shaggy, Blink 182 , Smash Mouth, and other 90's songs..) but I'm hoping they'll work out the kink on that one.  The staff was very welcoming and friendly, happy to suggest items from the menu.  The items on the menu are all named from lines from movies, which is really fun!  Food was great - Wonderful chili queso, tacos are priced between $3-$4, sides additional, and I thought $9 for a small bowl of chili was a little steep.  They offer a very eclectic cocktail menu and frozen margaritas which is also a nice addition.  Overall, great place!  I knocked off a star for the music and pricing, and the fact that chips and salsa weren't free..  Other than that, a must try."}
{"text":"Ruru's has an awesome patio, cool vibe, and yummy food. We had a GNO here and it was the perfect spot. The menu is unique with cool movie line names for all of their dishes - a fun touch!

You must try the dip trio - big portion of guac, salsa, and queso. Their chips are served warm and crispy. 

We had tacos and salads and all were tasty. The salads are large and perfect for sharing. Service was a bit slow, but it was ok because we weren't in a rush.

I do wish they took reservations, because when I'm with my significant other he never wants to eat here because we know there is always a wait!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. We met a couple of friends here tonight for dinner. The drink specials were good and the service was good but I can't say the same for the food I ordered. Add this to the long list of overpriced restaurants in the area... I got mahi tacos and fried oyster tacos with a side of white beans. Maybe they are stingy with seafood because it's more expensive than chicken but I might as well have ordered 2 tortillas with nothing but lettuce and sauce in them because that's basically what I got. There might have been an ounce of fish in each taco and that's probably me being generous when I say that. The oyster taco had two small fried oysters in it and the mahi taco had a very thin 2-inch strip of fish in it. The rest was the shell, lettuce and sauce. I was actually able to fold my taco in on both sides with no spillage. Totally not worth the $4.25 a piece we paid for them. And my side of white beans was pitifully small as well. Our friend ordered a burrito and it was huge but it appeared to be full of mostly rice. My husband looked at me and said \"next time we come here you should get a burrito\". I said \"I'm never eating here again\" and he agreed. His bend & snap salad was embarrassing too. Hardly a salad at all. It left him wanting more. We worked in the food service industry for many years so we understand plate presentation but when a nice looking plate results in hardly any substance (i.e. FOOD) then it's not worth it. We paid way too much for what little bit of food we ate tonight. This is also the only Mexican themed restaurant I've ever been to that makes you pay for chips and salsa. It's normally a free app at every table and even when it's not, I've never seen a $5 price tag for chips and salsa! Take a lesson from Cabo fish taco guys... I go there and I get FREE chips and salsa, amazing tacos and they're stuffed to the max with meat, so much so that it spills out of the taco when I pick it up. And they aren't as expensive either. Don't be stingy with your customers if you want them to return to your establishment. This is America. Most of us like hearty meals."}
{"text":"How can you call yourself a taco restaurant and charge for chips and salsa? I ordered a salad and asked to use salsa as my dressing. What do you know? They added an additional $1.50 to our bill for a small side of salsa. And to top it off...the salsa is just average and tastes store bought. Food is decent. Patio and atmosphere are great but there are other patios in Charlotte that I will be going to instead."}
{"text":"Ruru's tacos are one of my favorite in Charlotte, and the atmosphere just adds to how great this place actually is. It has been a go to for my friends and I for a while now, and the daily drink specials always have us trying something new. Unfortunately, the service the last two times I have dined at Ruru's has been an extreme damper on the night. About a month ago, I came in on a Saturday night with a group of three. We were sitting in a booth enjoying a second margarita after we had finished our tacos, and the MANAGER came over and said, \"can I clear any of these plates out of your way? We have guests who have been waiting on a table for a while\"..... This was completely unprofessional and made us feel very uncomfortable as he kept peering around the corner to see if we were getting up yet. Thursday night, I dined at Ruru's again, this time also with a group of 3. We enjoyed a beautiful night on the patio but our server seemed as if she hadn't slept in days. She didn't smile once, had zero emotion, and literally seemed as if she was moving in slow motion. She was incapable of explaining the drink special to us, and her only drink suggestion was a $16 shot of tequila. I sat and waited for a margarita as my friends drank theirs, and our waitress walked around aimlessly as if she had nothing to do. The food came out in a timely manner and as she brought it to the table, I told her I was still waiting on my drink. Her response was, \"they're making it\"... 
Sadly these last two experiences have left me feeling different about what I have always considered a wonderful restaurant. I hate to see one of my favorite places in Charlotte go downhill, but the staff needs a serious wake up call! Maybe next time I will do a take-out order so I can still enjoy the delicious tacos, but not have to worry about the staff's lack of people-skills :)"}
{"text":"I walked out of Ru Ru's the first time thinking the place had great potential. They definitely need to work on their service - it's slow and having all the staff linger around the bar, chit chat and eat there seemed a little weird/unprofessional? But whatever, place seems cool - I'd come back here with friends! The ambiance is beautiful and I was already envisioning spending many warm afternoons and evening on their patio enjoying a margarita or two. I came back a week later with some friends and this time we walked out just after a round of drinks and apps because the food was unimpressive and some aspects of the service were pretty bad too. My first time there we tried all the tacos and while the two chicken ones (fried & grilled) were really good, the others were mediocre. My second visit there we had the chips and guac, wings and calamari. The calamari was good, the guac was ok, but the wings were very gamey. What really drove us out though were the drinks. Aside from taking forever to get to us, they weren't even good. We also had a live bartending lesson going on behind our table at the bar, because of which they turned off the music. Really? 
we had to request it be turned back on (which they did eventually) because the place was really quiet and we could hear the step by step instructions on how our drinks were being prepared. Nothing wrong with that, but it was killing the vibe a bit. It's a great location, great set-up, perhaps it's still a diamond in the rough and needs a little more time?"}
{"text":"RuRu's was nothing exceptionally spectacular but nothing gut wrenchingly awful either. I will start with the positives: it is adorable, it has a nice feel inside the restaurant, a nice patio with its own bar, and plenty of seating available. Another plus... \"There's no crying in baseball\" is what one of the appetizers is named. Now, I know all of the items have movie related names but this is CLASSIC. (From one of my top 5 movies!) :)

Heads up for the chips and salsa lovers, they are not complimentary here you must purchase them. The chips were not our favorite because they did not taste fresh, but the salsa was extremely tasty--good ratio of chunky to juicy with a good spice to it.

My boyfriend ordered three tacos that afternoon (That's not a snowflake, Fat guy in a little coat, I'll have what she's having). It was nice that there was a small selection of $2 tacos for Taco Tuesday. 

Tacos were plated nicely, they are of moderate size, a la carte for the tacos. He was full eating two of them after chips and salsa. I am a vegan so I had to be a little tricky in order to eat something here. Vegetarians have a few options with ease. The waiter, who was actually the bartender, was very patient and correctly took my order. I got the \"You got no legs Lt. Dan\" (another good movie quote, by the way) with no cheese or creme, add avocado. They were very kind to take this order with ease and it came out correct as well. My only complaint about the dish was that several times throughout eating, I would get a bite of hardened rice that literally snapped/crunched. I understand food prep, but maybe being a little more mindful on keeping the food fresh would be beneficial. 

We had a margarita each, pretty classic taste, no complaints there. We did appreciate how hard the bartender was working to assist in waiting tables during the in-between lunch and dinner hours. He was also having to stock and mind to (both) the bars. He did a great job and was friendly. 

It is a restaurant close to home and they do have tofu options, so it is filed away in our places to give another try in the future."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole is this place good. Wow. First experience not one complaint. Queso. Guacamole and the chips are not just ordinary. Frozen margarita mhmmmm. Would deff go back. Exceptional service."}
{"text":"I just heard about this new addition to the area and made it in for a Friday night dinner.  While a bit tough to find from the Providence Road entrance, a subtle entry opens way to an impressively laid out restaurant.  The spacious bar and seating promotes a good atmosphere within the confines of the building but, untested is the elaborate outside bar setup which looks to be a must-go for warmer weather drinks.

The drinks were, simply, fantastic.  The food, however, was fantastically simple.  I'll lend some leniency given it's time on the scene, and give them credit for managing easy-to-miss operational issues like service quality and time.  As other reviews note, no freebees here, but the chips trio was great with very generously portioned guac/salsa/queso.  Calling it like it is, the food needs works.  The taste is short and I think the restaurant knows it as they appear to try to compensate with over serving taco-sauces (aioli, ranch-blah, etc.).  

Quite frankly, I'll be back b/c I loved the bar, loved the atmosphere and the food wasn't inedible, it just wasn't that good.  So I'll manage expectations accordingly.  I'm hoping that I can review the review upward in time to come."}
{"text":"There's a ton of hype around RuRu's, and it took me long enough, but I finally made it. I will say, their patio is really nice, but does the food live up to the hype?

I'm really glad that there's a late-night full service restaurant with this much nightlife around the Selwyn area, it's a much needed amenity. I enjoyed the environment, although the inside was LOUD! Like you couldn't hear yourself think, loud), and the service was... well, it was a little strange.

We were promptly seated (I called ahead about 30 minutes before and asked how much of a wait there would be and I got the answer \"you should be good\"), and then brought a...serving of chips and salsa? I knew these weren't complimentary here, so I told the guy that these weren't ours. Person #2 came up to our table shortly after and filled our water, and person #3 then came along and said that the chips were \"on them\" for the wait. What wait? Uh...what's going on? The chips were dense and suspiciously crispy, but I knew not to be impressed coming in. Salsa was good though!

We each got 3 tacos. We each loved one of them, and the other two were relatively plain. I enjoyed my crispy chicken and the lady enjoyed her tofu taco. 

I want to come back to hang out on the patio, and I regret that I didn't try any drinks, but it was a cool experience to check out. I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio on a beautiful Saturday for lunch. Get there a few minutes before noon because it got slammed quickly.

Parking isn't on Providence Road. It's in the back. Turn on Fenton, then look for the maroon and yellow sign. 

We ordered the Billy Ray Valentine, the queso dip with chorizo, corn relish, pico de gallo, and cilantro. It was yummy.

I ordered the Uncle Buck taco, with fried oysters. I wolfed that down with no shame. I also ordered the Bueller quesadillas, but it was pretty plain. 

I'd like to come back again on a weekend night because I'm sure it'll be fun. Nothin like a great patio and good food."}
{"text":"One of the best patios around.  They have music out on the patio on Wednesday's.  Service is always good, and the food also delicious.  The menu is a lot of fun, with menu items named after lines from movies.  Very cool vibe, great margaritas, and love the tacos.  This will be one of our regular spots with the warmer weather."}
{"text":"This place was very good . We sat outside on the very cute cozy patio. I had the RuRus burrito and it was so good , It could of used more of their hot sauce but over all it was loaded with flavor and really filled up . They accommodated the table nicely , some people had very specific orders and they did it no problem . We also had some desserts the sopapillas were not the type I'm used to but we're still good . Very sweet . We also had the tres leches but it wasn't my favorite, a little soggy for my taste . I will come back and try the tacos , they sounded and looked really good . Go here and try for yourself ."}
{"text":"Didn't live up to the hype for me. Service was sub-par, rang in a totally different meal for my friend than what she had ordered. Menu doesn't specify all of the spicy ingredients in all of the meals. Salsa and queso is overpriced. I've had better mexican food at cheaper restaurants. Best thing about this place was the back patio on a nice evening and the margaritas so I would go back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Atmosphere?  First time I've been to this part of \"The Villa\" since it was Uncle Milt's, and I have to say I think it's a shame no other restaurants have tried to make it work here since then (at least none that I can remember) as the space is awesome.  Easily the best ambiance of any of the \"taco & tequila\" places that seem to be everywhere in Charlotte lately.

Food & drink?  I started with their take on the Moscow Mule.  It had a rosemary syrup and sprig in it and was... okay.   Also payed for the free-in-most-places-like-this Chips & Salsa.  Worth the charge?  Not so much - chips were average at best, and the salsa tasted like it came from a jar.  Bummer, as that's usually my barometer for a place like this.  Oh well, on to the next course.  Had the Korean skirt steak taco, the Fried Oyster taco and a side of spicy slaw.  KB taco was pretty tasty.  Oyster taco had too much wasabi crema on it, but was otherwise okay.  Slaw was average.  My wife had the grilled Mahi taco and a side of organic jasmine brown rice.  She remarked that the taco hardly had any fish in it, and her side of rice \"angered\" her it was so bad.  She ate my slaw.  Kid had a Mexican soda and the cheese quesadilla (recco'd for kids).  We took a bite, and thought it was basic but serviceable.

Service?  Waiter was quite overwhelmed by the busy-ness of the evening - I asked to hear the RuRu's story, but he cut me off.  Barely saw him again until it was time to pay.  Fortunately he wasn't the one responsible for the delivery of the food or drinks - everything came on time.  Chips were even refreshed without asking.  

If only I had liked them enough to want more..."}
{"text":"RACIST!! I would really like to warn those trying to go visit Ruru's. Had a party of 8, everyone ordered food and we continued to drink for Cinco de mayo. Alcohol costs more than food. Our waitress was forced to cash us out and lost her section until we paid and left our table. We were not drunk, we were polite to everyone, and we were paying for our service. Unfortunately we are people of different shades of brown and it appears we were being pushed out for this reason only. There were several tables clear, and other occupied tables were sitting there and only drinking.  #Donaldtrumpcountry. Don't give them your money."}
{"text":"Really, really good. I was trolling the internet looking for good tacos in Charlotte and I found this little gem. You'd never know it was there if you weren't specifically looking for it. I drive past it every day twice on my way to work and back. $4 per taco is on par with other major cities like Austin or Dallas so it really wasn't any more expensive. Portion size is also pretty standard. I had \"You're going the wrong way\", \"Stage Five Clinger\", \"Fat Guy in a little coat\" and \"It was the dukes\". I'll be back for sure and next time I'll eat in."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere fine, but majority of food items plain and average. If the audience is one seeking non -authentic chain-quality food, this makes it (not sure if it is even part of a larger group of restaurants- but the food seems geared for a non-discriminating suburban crowd).

The menu was interesting and cute but I wish they had spent the same amount of time developing a more flavorful group of foods. One exception was the wings appetizer which I felt was excellent and might be the only reason I'd return. 

Main course of fajitas looked nice and the chicken was well-grilled but the accompanying peppers and onions seemed like they had been prepared earlier and were kept warm and soggy until time to use. This was probably the most flavorless serving of this dish I'd ever had. Needed seasoning and freshly grilled peppers and onions. No avocado provided (probably was for an extra price). Just a little grated American cheese and sour cream. Rice and beans served with this did not excite me. 

Shrimp and chicken tacos ok but lacked flavor. Quesadillas were better. 

Oh well. Try it and draw your own conclusions."}
{"text":"I just realized I never updated my review. The manager reached out to me and invited me back in for a meal on the house sans the hair. I took her up on the offer and gave RuRu's a second chance. While my meal was good and this time did not have hair it was far from on the house. I was promptly brought a tab despite mentioning the situation. Thank goodness I did bring my wallet with me. 

Ordered a burrito from Postmates and some chips w/salsa. Chips and salsa were standard but not worth $5. Went to eat pork belly burrito this morning and found a hair. It went immediately in the trash. Absolutely DISGUSTING! Won't be ordering from here again. If the prices weren't a deterrent ($11 burritos and $4 tacos) then the unsanitary hair in my food certainly is."}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that I truly enjoyed RuRu's!!  They are not your traditional Tex/Mex place but they have some great staple items along with several unique things.

I am NOT a fan of the fact that they don't offer free chips and salsa but we did order the guacamole and it was VERY good.  Small portion but done very well.

I ordered the chicken bowl and my favorite part was the cilantro queso crème thing that was drizzled on top!  It was tasty and filling and the price was right!  Husband ordered the burrito and that was HUGE but also pretty good.  

I like the atmosphere, the service was relatively friendly, the food was good, the prices are good...overall a good place!  It isn't my favorite restaurant in Charlotte but I will definitely be back.  

And PS..I agree with others...the parking is brutality at its finest!  They need to figure that stuff out asap!"}
{"text":"I want to preface this review with stating that I'm in the service industry so I like to think that I'm understanding to some of the little weird quirks of certain servers and bartenders. RuRu's has pretty decent food and amazing cocktails, so it stinks that my rating couldn't be higher, but the little blonde bartender tonight was something else. First of all we came in at 10pm, and the posted closing time is 11pm, and received huffs and puffs and eye rolls all the way to the kitchen where she  checked if we could still order food. Every item I tried to order on the menu that was smacked down in front of me, she then told me was the wrong choice and poked fun at. I asked for a to-go cup for my Diet Coke and then she charged me for 2 drinks, which is plain stupid. Lastly a friend and I just simply wanted to split our $15 dip appetizer and were told that it would be too hard for her to split the item. You're using MICROS, the same computer system 90% of the Charlotte dining scene uses, it is VERY possible and VERY easy to do. Moral of the story, homegirl just wanted to boost the price of our bill to receive a larger tip. I get it. It was a slow night. Little did she know that I make a living off bartending and tip minimum 40% short of the server cussing me out. In this case I actually left MORE than that, but I just want management to know (if you're reading this) that your food is only as good as the hands serving it!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. It can be a little pricy at times because there's generally not a really good drink special but the drinks are always good and the tacos are great. I definitely suggest the fat guy in a little coat taco."}
{"text":"Not the best! My group ordered a variety of dips, tacos and margaritas. The margaritas and guacamole were good, but the tacos weren't the greatest. I tried the pork belly, mahi mahi, and the shrimp tacos. All of which didn't have the best flavor. I would definitely recommend for guacamole and margs but not tacos!"}
{"text":"Talk about a patio at this great taco place!  So many good reasons to love this hot spot. First and foremost I find the food to be absolutely delicious and very reasonable for the quality!  I have to say I keep wanting to try something other than tacos but I like them too much!  I have had a side salad which was very well topped and prepared. 

Patio on fleek!  This place has a nice balance of shaded areas for lunch, and cool light strings across in the evening. The outdoor bar gazebo is also very large. The inside is nice as well, though the patio is where it's at if the weather is cooperative. 

The staff is always very friendly and service is pretty quick once you are seated. The drinks are also very good here I must say. And of course the names of both the drinks and the meals are very unique. 

Finally, make sure to take note of the parking lot off Fenton Place and tell your first time friends meeting you there. The address location being Providence Rd and having that small lot in the front makes it a bit tricky your first time at the Ru."}
{"text":"I live nearby so have been here at least a dozen times because it is convenient. Neither myself nor my husband has ever been blown away. And our neighbors who have been all echo the same sentiment.  I've never heard anyone in the neighborhood rave about it.

Food is usually okay, nothing special but sometimes it's pretty good. Very hit or miss. A couple of times it's been just plain bad but that's pretty rare.

Drinks are pretty tasty. They have good margarita options. But better ask for a double because they're weak.

Service has taken forever every single time we have gone (10 mins to get your drink order in, another 10-15 to actually get the drinks/ order your food, another 25-30 to get your food. And good luck finding your waiter if you want another drink).

The redeeming quality is the ambiance. Awesome outdoor area with a bar and regular tables. Inside is also very inviting.

So if you just want a nice place to sit for a (long) while and drink and eat decent food, try it out. If your looking for really good Mexican food, skip it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some great tacos, drinks and atmosphere, this is your place. This was my first time going and I will definitely be back. They have a great patio and even had live music when I was there on Wednesday. 

The tres amigos appetizer is a great started along with anyone of their craft cocktails or great selection of beers. 

Any one of their tacos are great too and definitely can't go wrong with any of the selections."}
{"text":"Ru Ru's is a great place to come and relax after a long work day!

The patio is fairly large with open seating. The food is consistent but they cocktails and specials are my favorite part. If you're looking for a good place to get together with friends ( or by yourself!) Ru Ru's is always a solid choice to go and unwind!"}
{"text":"Great options for tacos! I got the mahi mahi and slow roasted pork tacos, which were both excellent. Side chopped salad avocado cilantro dressing is my favorite and put it on the tacos too. 

Staff was friendly but slow. They had just started getting busy after we walked in though. 

Overall, loved the outdoor atmosphere and options for margaritas."}
{"text":"This place is very cool and the staff is even cooler. I attended a foodie event here with a girlfriend. They accompanied us very well and made us feel
At home - all 12 of us lol. You will notice on the menu that everything is movie related. Even down to the drinks. My favorite was the duck von dong taco and my frozen strawberry margarita. The cheese dip was good and the child were fresh. Visit on Tuesday for $2 tacos. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMY!!

This place has some of the best tacos!! The menu and taco names are hilarious - love the \"Fat Guy In A Little Coat\" taco - seriously the best one. Their salsa and guac is made in house daily so it's fresh, service is wonderful - the manager confirmed we were doing good & our server Jackie C was outstanding!!
 
Best tip about this place: there is parking on the backside, opposite of the Providence street side. We parked off of Providence, which was a bit harder to find, but once you go through the door of the shopping complex it brings you to the back of the restaurant. & the patio is awesome!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for lunch because they have an adorable patio that looked perfect for the sunny weather and we love tacos and margaritas. 

The patio did not disappoint - it's fairly large so it can accommodate a lot of people and they had heat towers too, presumably for when it starts to cool down at night.

The food was pretty average though. I will rave about the queso - they give you so much and unlike most places it doesn't congeal after 15min. The tacos on the other hand weren't that great. The flavors were okay but the steak in one of mine was very dry and the mahi mahi taco was very lack-luster. Definitely not $4-5 tacos in my opinion. The drink list is extensive, I ended up getting the Buck Rogers and thought it was very good. All in all, I would probably go back and just do apps and drinks.

Lastly, the service was oddly slow. Granted I wasn't in a huge rush I was startled by how long it took to place our lunch order and get our checks at the end of the meal. If you know you want a drink and/or app order right away instead of waiting for your server to ask."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican restaurant with great food. Creative dishes and names. 
The \"you talking to me\" margarita was great if you like spicy!
Nice atmosphere but noisy. 
Customer service was excellent, we will be back"}
{"text":"Been here twice and have not been disappointed. Take some time and really explore the menu...and the cocktail list has some hidden gems on there as well. The menu names are killer....can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I saw their post on IG about $2 Taco & $3 draft beer specials (mind you it's specific tacos). So of course, the fiancé and I were curious, as we've never been here before.

First off, if the special is only on certain tacos, you'd think the waitress would tell us which ones. Nope. She didn't even tell us the drink specials (thankfully I looked them up in advance). Connie overlooked my fiancé and I, and seemed distracted even though this place was ANYTHING but busy. 

I ordered Fat Guy in a Little Coat, Uncle Buck and I'll Have What She's Having tacos. The Fat Guy Taco's steak was well cooked, but lacked citrus. The Crispy chicken taco had dry chicken, and also lacked flavor. Uncle Buck had the most flavor out of the 3, but also seemed to lack some citrus/flavor.

My fiancé then asked our waitress (when she finally reappeared) for a few lemon wedges. 10 min later, she comes back with my fiancée beer and our lemon wedges. Weird.

So the beer was great- we ordered Legion Juicy J- but our tacos were overpriced ($4 when we thought $2) and lacked in flavor. Probably THE most disappointing Tacos we've ever had. $50? Not worth it.

You're better off going to Bakersfield East Blvd. (life changing Tacos) or spending a little more $$ and eat at Cabo Fish Taco.


Might come back here for drinks (though we've heard those are also overpriced and stingy) but this experience was extremely disappointing.


Maybe we caught Connie on a bad day but, save yourself the wasted time/money!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome.  Food was awesome.  Good beer selection and creative cocktails.   outaide patio and bar will be fun on my next visit."}
{"text":"Great hot spot. Fun and funky pop culture/movie lines-inspired dish titles on an extensive menu- for a taco place! I had and recommend the Long Duck Dong taco with Korean short rib meat and the roasted veggie taco. Guac was good and came fast. Burritos are HUGE. Very tasty fajitas too. The waiter was personable and the atmosphere was lively. Beautiful inside or on the large patio and outside bar. When we arrived we were told by the hostesses there was a 90 minute wait. The manager assured us it wouldn't be that long. We sat down within 15 minutes. That was the only negative - the hostesses should have a better grasp. But the manager handled us perfectly and we had a great night as a result."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I had a great experience. I have come here 3 times since and this will be my last time. Unfortunately, the environment inside is super noisy. The patio is the only perk of this over priced taco joint. There is a new restaurant in town called Bakersfield that has a lot better of environment and 100x better food and it's right down the street. Not to mention the sanitation rating was a 90.5 at RuRus. Plates will be taken off the table while you are still eating and you won't get out of there for one person under $20... Sorely disappointed expensive margaritas for them to be mediocre."}
{"text":"It was Taco Tuesday so I ordered a couple of tacos and they were good.  The food is Amercan/Mexican but as good if not better than the other Mexican restaurants I have been to in town. The best thing about the place is the outdoor seating and the tequila.  It is a great spot for dinner and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"TiAnna, Tara, and Rico are the best behind the bar. And Wade is the guy that will take care of you because he is the best around."}
