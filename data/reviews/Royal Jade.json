{"text":"Food tasted exceptionally great highly recommended for the hakka portion of menu. Pakoras and Manchurian chicken tasted excellent great service very nice people in general"}
{"text":"Authentic Hakka Indian food has finally arrived in the neighbourhood!  Happy with all the food ordered for takeout and can't wait to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious Hakka. Everything we tried was really delicious and I'm usually not impressed with Hakka. The service was efficient , the restaurant very clean, the food extremely reasonably priced, but most importantly, the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"A new hakka chinese restaurant in Keele and Steeles area. The place is decorated nicely and the staff are very friendly. I've tried several dishes in their menu and they are all tasty.. and on top of that the prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for lunch.  Actually surprised because the interior is quite nice and it's super clean.  I had the Manchurian chicken as well as the eggplant.  Both good choices.  I asked the owner to prepare it with less spice and he did so which was great."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, so happy to have a Halal Hakka restaurant close to home. Excellent customer service, food comes quickly and the restaurant is squeaky clean. Most importantly: large portions for low prices. After much experimentation, my go-to order for 2-3 people is:   A06: Chicken pakora ($8.99)  B05: Crispy ginger beef ($9.99) FR11: Manchurian chicken fried rice ($8.95)"}
{"text":"Went after reading reviews. Nice, open and clean establishment. Ordered takeout so dine service review will have to wait. Food was very good. Really enjoyed the taste  Lollipop chicken 5/5. It was flavourful and juicy, eat it hot.   Chicken fried wonton 3/5, lacks flavour punch but they use a good amount of stuffing.  Crispy beef, 5/5, went on recommendation of another reviewer and it did not disappoint. Was a hit with my party of 4. Especially liked the charred red chillies in the dish. Nice and smoky  Kungpao chicken 4/5, always my go to dish, so always biased, but flavor were good, and unlike most other Chinese or hakka places not loaded with green peppers or water chestnut. Also has a deep smoky flavor tone from the charred red chillies.  Nasigoreng fried rice 3. 5/5. Nice flavor but tapered down to act as a base for the curries and saucy dishes, huge quantity,  Hakka noodles 3/5 had a bit of an after taste, maybe reused oil to stir fry.  I will definitely go again.  They also have a Thai menu. Looking to order from there in my next visit.  RECOMMEND TO MANAGEMENT: switch out your oils often, especially if you are deep frying a lot. Otherwise wish you all the success in the world. Very glad you chose the neighborhood to open your establishment."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and every time was fantastic: very reasonable prices, great food and awesome friendly service from this fully family-run resto.  Our favourites are the deep-fried cauliflower and the royal jade house special soup. On the latest visit, we asked for the ginger crispy beef made instead with chicken since we had one person that couldn't eat red meat.  The chef kindly obliged and it was AWESOME!  Definitely should be added to the menu. :)"}
{"text":"Great little place nested in the Keele and Steeles area. Food is fresh and tasty. I enjoy their lunch menu almost every week as the portions and price are reasonable by today's standards. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. This area was lacking an alternative to the regular Chinese or Thai and now it has one....Royal Jade is worth the visit whether it's chilli chicken, hakka noodles or a sizzling platter. They also have a few vegetarian options as well (my favourite is the tofu and mix veg in spicy  garlic sauce on rice)"}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate dinner at this place, and it's excellent. We had the crispy ginger beef and the Manchurian chicken, per someone else's recommendation and they were both awesome. Portions are generous and the price is very reasonable. It's hard to find food nowadays that costs less than $10, but this place has it. Also, the 2 people who served our food were very nice. We are already planning our next visit here!"}
{"text":"An awesome little Hakka spot just waiting to reach stardom. Great atmosphere, clean and well kept restaurant, delicious food, and to top it all off....the world's most courteous, polite, and friendly owner (or I think he was the owner).  We ordered chicken Manchurian, and Manchurian Hakka noodles....both were delicious and worth ordering again.  We also ordered fish pakora appetizer, it was different from what we were expecting, but good in its own right. We do prefer decent sized pieces of seasoned fish cited in batter and fried, but this was a more fish Manchurian balls type of preparation."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try a random restaurant and ended up at Royal Jade. The place was nice and clean and the service was excellent. We ordered a tom yum soup, the chili chicken dish, sweet and sour shrimp and the mango shakes. The shakes were great, with a good amount of fruitiness and thickness. The shrimps in the sweet and sour dish were big and delicious, but the sauce was a little too thick (it was like a puree). I still enjoyed it though. The chili chicken was okay in my opinion - my friend liked it but I thought it was missing a sweet or spicy flavour. The soup was also great - the only downside was that the shrimps used in the soup were very small but they made up for it with the giant shrimps in the sweet and sour dish. Overall, I'd say Royal Jade is one of the better restaurants in the area and I would come back here again to try other stuff and get more of the mango shake."}
{"text":"The big led sign board outside the restautant caught our attention. Upon entering we found out that the place has been opened for 3 months only. Everything is neat and the cutulary were shinning.   We ordered the house special soup, chicken pakora, lollipop chicken, chilli chicken, green beans, butter chicken . The house special soup was nice with a little kick spicy hot from the white pepper. All the other dish were fresh and delicious.  Portion was good and the food was definitely cheap.  Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am pleased with the quality of food and service, very friendly and helpful staff.  If you are a fan of hakka then you know exactly what makes for good pakoras and the other staples we come here for."}
{"text":"Royal Jade is a new addition to the list of Hakka restaurants in the city as its been opened since November 2017. I've been to many Hakka restaurants in my time,but I must say Royal Jade is among the winner! Sorry Federick, Good Luck, Tangerine, Lin Garden but this place does it better.  Though its not close to home being located on Steeles Ave between Dufferin and Keele, it's worth the drive. The restaurant is clean, their portions are sufficient, prices are reasonable and the staff are attentive and personable.   So far this is the closest most authentic Hakka restaurant I've experienced to this day.  Unlike the other places that use a lot of corn starch in their food, Royal Jade focuses on pure, flavorful authenticity.  In terms of food we had their: Chicken Pakora Chicken Hakka chow mein Sweet Hakka chow mein Royal Jade House Soup Chili Chicken Crispy Beef Fish with red wine sauce.  All of which was an easy 5/5!! I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The place came recommended from a fellow yelper and I finally made it here. Started with the fish pakora and then the Royal Jade soup. The fish pakora was fantastic but the soup I wasn't too crazy about. Having come a ways to get here, I had to sample a bunch of dishes. Had some Chow Main, some fish fish, a rice dish and a beef and broccoli dish. All were decent, but to be fair, I missed some of the distinct flavors I have enjoyed at other places before and expected to have here.  My highlight was the fish pakora and the beef and broccoli dish.  Would I recommend this place? Absolutely."}
{"text":"I came here after reading rave reviews on the restaurant, and I always drive by here whenever I head off to work in the mornings.  I came here with my dad on a Saturday evening, and to my surprise, it was quite empty. I think it might be because it's a fairly new establishment, but I'm not complaining that I got seated quite quickly.  My dad and I ordered the Manchurian chicken, the hakka chow mein and the royal jade house special soup. We got the medium sized soup and found that it could serve both of us 2-3 bowls each. The soup has a strong spice to it, a lot more than expected. But it was still delicious!  The taste of the hakka chow mein reminds me a lot of beef ho fun. The portion was quite huge, and my dad and I had to pack it home since we could not finish.  The best dish would be the manchurian chicken. It took a while for it to come out, but after tasting the sauce I realized it was definitely worth the wait!! It goes great with steamed rice and again, portions are quite large.  The service was definitely on point, and it's a very clean establishment. I am definitely coming back here again to try out more food!"}
{"text":"Amazing Hakka food with generous portions! I loved the chicken lollipop which was hot and crispy. The Manchurian fried rice was delicious as well - not too spicy yet full of flavour.   The service is friendly and attentive.   The restaurant was not very busy on a Sunday night. While the restaurant is decently renovated, the restaurant has questionable signs to prevent theft, which makes the restaurant feel less safe."}
{"text":"My new Fav Hakka restaurant. This place is located in a plaza and has a very nice decor. Owners are super nice and welcoming. We ordered home style dumplings and fish pakora to start. Dumplings were mind blowing and Fish pakora was just fine. I wish they would have used more fish and less better and this is the only reason I gave them 4 stars. In main course we ordered Munchurian chicken, Munchurian chowmein and chilli fish. Everything was just perfect. It's a great place if you like Indian hakka, definitely try them out. I will keep coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Eh, again same food every day. I joking this is a really nice and clean place with huge variety of food. I would assume meat is pretty fresh and hopefully will stay same way over time"}
{"text":"I have to say I am quite pleasantly surprised by this place (in a good way)!  This restaurant is located around the York University (steeles and keele) area, and this is not exactly an area teeming with lots of easily accessible good eats. I would imagine you only go to this area to eat because you work in the area, or you make a special trip to a restaurant in this area which is what we did tonight.  There are not really any residential areas nearby or other places you can go to (supermarket for example), but we were in the area (Ikea) and found this place through Yelp.  We arrived around 6:30 on a Friday evening and was very pleasantly greeted. This location is nice and clean and actually REALLY easy to find.  When driving along Steeles, just look for the hugeee neon flashing sign in a plaza. Yup thats Royal Jade.  Did I mention that the people that served us was super nice? Yup just saying it again.  My wife and I ordered 3 dishes and a drink.   The Nasi Gorang was tasty and full of good stuff (lots of fried egg, shrimp and meat). They definitely did not skimp out on the \"good stuff\" in this dish, though it was not exceptional. I dont mind getting it again, but I would rather try something else on the menu next time.  What stood out more was everything else. The crispy beef was actually super tasty and the consistency was excellent. We have been to other restaurants and ordered \"crispy\" beef before and only ended up getting \"soggy\" beef. For this dish, it felt like this restaurant fried and prepared the beef first, then tossed it into the sauce and gave it a quick stir around. This allowed the beef to remain nice and crispy, but at the same time nicely coated.  Other restaurants I assume either do the same thing but cook it in the sauce too long - therefore making it soggy. Or just toss it all in together and cook it up and call it \"crispy\" beef but its not. This place is actually really \"crispy\" beef and they get it right.  The chicken pakoras were excellent here. We have been to a few Hakka style restaurants (Lin garden being the one we end up going back to the most) because they have good pakoras with lots of heat.  Royal jade makes their pakoras with lots of meat and very little breading. Basically when you bite into the pakora its crispy, yet remains very juicy with the chicken inside. Lin Garden tends to have a LOT of breading to make their pakoras \"look\" big but they arent really. And usually lin garden you can get about maybe 6 \"large\" pakoras for much more then Royal Jade. Royal jade pakoras are a better deal quantity wise, and taste wise. My wife especially enjoyed the green cilantro/parsley sauce on the side with the pakoras.  The pakoras were nice, juicy and carried a bit of heat. The contrast in flavors by dipping it in the cilantro/parsley sauce is really unique tasting and addictive we had to ask for a second helping of sauce.   I also got \"lassi\" (sweet flavored) on the side. This reminded me of sweetened kefir if you have had it before. This definitely helped me keep my food down as some of it really packed a kick of heat! Having some dairy to reduce the heat helped!  All in all, I would definitely come back again to try a few more dishes. This place is a bit out of the way and is a bit of a hike to get to, but honestly so is Lin Garden for us.   Im looking forward to my next visit and would definitely recommend this place as a worthy try."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting from Orlando and found this place thankfully. Staff was wonderful, very nice and prompt. Food was excellent. The pakora chicken was particularly delightful. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and their chilli chicken definitely differs from a lot of Hakka Chinese restaurants I've been to in terms of taste. I love their Szechuan noodles. Their service is absolutely amazing. Just friendly and accommodating staff. I would give them a 5 if it wasn't for the chilli chicken. Lol I absolutely love chilli chicken but unfortunately the one here just doesn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! A group of friends and I decided to give this place a try after church recently and was happy as we did for the nice service of the family owned restaurant matched up with the lovely food.   From everything we ordered (check out pictures!) must gets are: Deep fried Cauliflower- they were exceptionally packed with flavor and oh so crispy and was the major surprise of our whole group as we didn't think that it could be so yummy! Crispy Ginger Beef as well as the Chicken Pakora were also favorites. Along with the Garlic Sauce Eggplant if we had to choose a 4th runner up.   The Manchurian Fried Rice and Hakka Noodles were a bit of a let down for us as we expected more flavor. All in all what we learned was that we shouldn't have ordered rice or noodles as each dish you order comes with steamed rice. So it's actually better to order dishes and eat them with plain rice next time!"}
{"text":"if there was more stars i'd give it!  way better than fredericks and china cottage hands down!"}
{"text":"Came here to try their lunch specials after reading such good reviews on Yelp, and glad to say it did not disappoint! Portions were huge, taste was flavourful and service was great. I tried their Lemon Chicken and although it wasn't as crispy as other places, it was delicious! My brother had the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce which also tasted really good. Their Mango Lassi was a bit pricy but yummy. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First of all i have to say the customer service is incredible here and the staff are very friendly.  I ordered Manchurian beef fried rice and have to say looked pretty good and spicy. It was really flavorless until hot sauce and soy sauce was added. The beef was tender so though.  I recommend getting a dish that has sauce if your going to order fried rice here."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a go as it is closer than Golden Asian.  Hubby ran out to take out for us.  Manchow soup was more of an egg-drop/pea/carrot type soup with lashings of white pepper.  It was OK but not spectacular.  The Manchurian-Hakka noodles were OK, had a good bit of \"wok-hay\" but greasy as heck.  The Manchurian chicken was edible not the best I have ever had and appeared to have been breaded/deep fried.  I still prefer Bombay chicken with the wicked dry seasoning.  It seems as though they are altering the spice levels for the ... er ... local palate.  I wish the flavours had been bolder and more out there like what we've had at the other place.  Not terrible by any means, but OK."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner tonight. The crispy ginger beef and Manchurian chicken were both great. Spicy and saucy, well seasoned, just so delicious. I loved the Manchurian hakka lo mein with vegetables - a nice big pile of noodles with tons of bean sprouts and veggies. Chicken pakoras were okay but fish pakoras were light and flaky with a wonderful crispiness. The coriander sauce was terrific. The owners were also so kind and welcoming to our little one and gave her a booster seat and kids meal set."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Hakka? Being one of my favorites, I was excited to read so many positive reviews about this place.  Located in a non descript strip mall on the north side of Steeles (so technically in Vaughan), you really have to search this place out. We visited on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and were the only patrons in the restaurant....but I imagine that during the week it would be fairly busy with people from the local businesses.  We ordered:   1) Chicken Pekora - flavorful, meaty, mildly spicy....they were excellent.   2) Hakka Chow Mein - spaghetti pasta tossed in spices, with chicken and a few veggies....I thought it was flavorful. Based on other reviews I was expecting something more interesting. Don't get me wrong..I enjoyed it..but the hype wasn't lived up to.  3) Chilli Chicken (dry) - spicy. I usually order this dish in sauce, but my dining companion preferred dry..so I can't compare it to other places I've had chilli chicken. I thought it was flavorful and really enjoyed it.  Portion size for all dishes was excellent...we brought food home. Staff were friendly Restaurant was spotless Clean washrooms Decor pretty bland  I'd visit again if in the area, but wouldn't do a special drive to return."}
{"text":"Dropped into RJ's for lunch. Parking was available but limited due to the cars parked for the other businesses. Walked in, the place was bright and well decorated, clean and pleasant to sit and order.   Looked over the lunch specials and decided that it would be best to order the dinner size to share as the lunch plate looked good but I was extra hungry and wanted a larger serving. We decided on the Szechuan chicken and Hakka noodles, both showed spicy and I was looking forward to it as it, It's been a while since my last Hakka fix. Pricing was fair and plate size was perfect for 2 to 3 (on its own).  To my surprise we also received a bowl of soup, can't remember the name of it (see pic) was slightly spicy and the flavor was quite good. Once soup was done they brought us the noodles, looked great and tasted even better and the chicken followed, it was not spicy at all (for my taste) however it was very flavorful and tasty.  I can't believe I liked it without any spice....if this is an example of the type of food this place  puts out....all I can say is WOW!  I'd say this place is above average, even upscale in terms of their food and flavors. They have it all, clean, nice decor and great food. Reading previous reviews I gladly stand behind them and would definitely recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"I must admit I was a little sceptical of a 5 star for Thai place but if I could give them a 6 star I would. I ordered Manchurian and BOY IT WAS SPICY HOT! I asked the server to pack it up for my girlfriend that loves spicy food and the server said I could change it no problems. I ask what was hotter, Chile chicken or Manchurian and she said the Chili chicken was hotter...Damn that will burn you a new one for sure! Anyways she also mention that you can ask for how spicy or not do you want it. I order no spice and now coriander. Food was amazing! Excellent service too. Will be back for more!"}
