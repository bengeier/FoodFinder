{"text":"I stopped yesterday, first visit to Al Hamra. It was around 5 pm--I was only customer & ordered to go. I ordered chicken tikka Masala with potatoes (paid extra for potatoes), and samosa appetizer. I got home and the samosas were so oily and, evidently due to the container they put it in, were falling apart soft not crispy & flaky as I was hoping. They forgot to add the potatoes to the masala. The masala was very hot & in a plastic container, so it almost melted the container. Taste was nothing special and prices MUCH higher than other better Indian restaurants I have been to around Phoenix. I don't think it's a good idea to order out with this restaurant. Might have been better experience if dining in.."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a week and have not found another  Indian restaurant  that compares. The chicken  tikka Masada and chicken Miami are our favorites!"}
{"text":"North Scottsdale has needed a good Indian restaurant since I moved here twelve years ago.  My wife and I dined at Al Hamra a couple of days ago and can report that our demand has at last been met.    Seeing a vindaloo on the menu had me correctly guess that the chef had arrived in the USA via Britain, which has a long history of Indian cuisine.  We started with samosas after which I had the lamb vindaloo and my wife tried the chicken korma, all very good.  For dessert, we were presented with a complimentary rice pudding, also good.  Prices are in line with the location - expect to pay a bit more here in the pricey North Scottsdale location.  Decor was a bit nondescript - really very little Indian character and in my opinion needs a bit more attention to set the tone of the place."}
{"text":"My husband and I were leaving Taliesin West when we had a craving for Indian food. I used my smart phone to find the nearest place, which led us to this restaurant. We came in around 5 pm, and we were the only ones in the restaurant. I'm sure people usually eat later than we did. The restaurant had tablecloths, cloth napkins, glassware, hookahs as design pieces, and even the bathroom's interior was done nicely. Our waiter was very friendly and checked on us often. We ordered the Bengun Bhartha (jumbo eggplants baked in tandoor cooked with onion, ginger, vine ripened tomatoes and blend of spices) and the Chicken Karachi (chicken saut√©ed with onion, bell peppers and tomatoes in iron wok with touch of ginger). We also ordered garlic naan. Since we like our food spicy, we asked about how spicy we can have our food. We were surprised to hear a 10-point spice scale, so we decided on 6-7 spiciness. That turned out well, since it was spicy enough for us, but not too spicy. Reading the review about the person who ordered the 9-point spiciness made me realize that I'm a wimp compared to some folks in the Southwest. I once went to a chili restaurant in LA that had a 10-point scale, and I sampled the 10--El Diablo--which turned my lips numb. I kid you not! That's why I decided on 6-7 since my previous experience with 10-point scales showed me to stay south of 8 points.  Our meal was pleasant, and we were delighted to find a good Indian spot in Scottsdale. It was a little more expensive than what we usually frequent, but it is located in Scottsdale. Our meal came out to over $40 for the two of us. Another couple came in as we were finishing our meal. I am not sure how popular Indian food is in Arizona, but when we inquired at the reception desk of our resort, the woman did not know anything about ethnic foods. (She kept pushing big chain restaurants at us. Not our scene!) I would definitely return to this restaurant if I had a hankering for Indian, although I'm not sure how it compares against the other Indian restaurants in the area. I found it authentic and tasty for my first shot at Indian in this state."}
{"text":"I am always hesitant to try Indian food.  We just moved to DC Ranch. We decided to try this restaurant.  My husband picked up the food to go.  We chicken vindaloo and lamb Masala curry and Tandori chicken- plus naan and rice and samosas.  Everything was amazing.  I have never tasted better Indian food.  Love love.  Be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian Cuisine ! Ask for Mario too - he is charming knowledgeable and a delight!"}
{"text":"I could have made better Indian food--and I'm Irish!  We were the only ones in the place.  Strange decor and poor food for the money.  If you've ever been to Toronto, London or cities with a significant Indian population, you're sure to be disappointed.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"We got shrimp biryani to go.  Inside the restaurant was completely silent - definitely peaceful.  The biryani was very spicy even at a level 5.  The shrimp pieces were plentiful, and big too.   The sauce it comes with was good.  The downside was that it was a little under $20 for the one order and it was much smaller than we expected."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Al Hamra for the first time tonight and we both really enjoyed it.   We started with Samosa's.  They had good flavor and taste, not a lot of spice. The plain Naan was warm and delicious. Entree's were Chicken Tikki Masala (spicy scale =3) and Lamb Korma (spice scale = 8).  Both were flavorful and well prepared though I thought the sauce to meat ratio was a little high.   I don't tolerate spicy food and 3 was just right.  By the time I finished my mouth was pleasantly warm.  8 for my spice craving husband was perfect for him.  He was sweating under his eyes and enjoying every bite. Both entree's came with jasmine rice laced with cumin and cardamom - yum. Yes, the prices are a bit high but you pay for the location.  I think it's well with it.  Ask for Damir (not sure of the spelling) - he was genuine and attentive."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. Mario was are server did a great job and made some good suggestions. The ultimate naan was awesome, a great starter. I had the lamb vindaloo was perfect @ a 7. My wife had the shrimp tikka masala, very tasty sauce almost like a bisque. This was are first visit, we'll be back again."}
{"text":"This  is hands down one of the nicer looking Indian restaurants in the city. Located in a very upscale part of town , it keeps up by having very good ambience and very professional service. All this comes at a price. Literally. This is also one of the priciest Indian restaurants in the city. The food by that standard not the most amazing i have ever eaten. The food is satisfactory though. I had the lamb biryani and the chicken makhani which were both done good. So come here for a fancy night out when you are prepared to pay more for a decent meal.  If , however, all you are craving for is good old indian cuisine and do not want to burn a hole in your pocket, there are plenty of other alternatives in the city."}
{"text":"The food here is decent, and has been the best of the various Indian and Pakistani restaurants within a 15 mile radius. You cannot compare it to Chicago or Houston South Asian restaurants, but will satisfy your cravings especially if your palette is Delhi or Lahore cooking. My biggest complaint and the reason for not giving 4 stars is the price - definitely more expensive than the other restaurants in the area, and overpriced in general."}
{"text":"We had carry out for our family last night.  We have been eating Indian food for 20 years, including multiple trips to India.    We were very disappointed from three perspectives.   Price, portions, and quality.  Quality is subjective, but I can say that several of the dishes were definitely sub-par (Chicken Tikka was dry, Lamb Kabab was dry, etc).      The real kicker is for $19 to $20 per dish (which is at least 30% higher than any other Indian Restaurants in the area), the portions were significantly smaller than any we have EVER seen.   We had a group of 6 and our $150 carry out was not enough to feed the entire group.    I believe given the quality, portions, and price they will not be in business much longer.    I recommend before going you yelp other Indian Restaurants in the area and head there before you pay too much, and get too little!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Pretty good Indian food at north Scottsdale. Garlic naan and roti were great. Will be back to try other dishes"}
{"text":"The high quality of ingredients has already been mentioned but deserves emphasis. Having ordered lamb dishes once a week for three decades in major cities, this is the only restaurant where I have never had to deal with tough gristly meat. Flavors and breads authentic and fresh. Unfortunately a limited menu, with no Sheek kebab and all the vegetarian dishes served full size (and full price) so not practical to order a variety of veggie dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food. Great service. We had the samosa, chicken naan, and rice pudding. It was excellent. It's just beyond the Lamp restaurants in the big shopping/restaurant development where Maestro's is."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this little Indian restaraunt often.  The wait staff is always  super helpful when we want to try new items and are all very kind.  Try their Fish Coconut we can't get enough of it!!  Their Naan with chicken is also a crowd favorite."}
{"text":"Best food and decor will be back soon   Holly in San Diego  Synergy World"}
{"text":"Lamb Korma and garlic Naan were the best I have ever tried! Food has it is unique flavor and by far, the best indian food I ever had."}
{"text":"Too bad!  We had a very nice meal last summer but we were the only table there. Tonight we walked in.  There were a total of six tables which meant a mostly empty restaurant but after being seated, and waiting for 20 minutes without even having anyone ask for a drink order while the manager? Owner? Chatted at length with people at a table nearby we gave up and walked out. Oh well. Searching for our new favorite Indian place in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Superb Mughal classics, served with great style in a gentle and relaxing atmosphere.  Great wine list, too, which Indian restaurants often lack.  Prices are higher than most neighborhood curry houses, but the quality of the ingredients is definitely worth the splurge if you truly love this cuisine.  A great place!"}
{"text":"Start with the good:  Service was informative, helpful and accommodating.  Excellent.                                    Samosas and spicy sauces were very good.  OK:                           Chicken Tiki Marsala on the bland side                                 Dreadful:                   Lamb Saag barely chewable.  Chicken dish of pieces, dry; Basmati rice                                   was tasteless, no flavor  Final:                         Prices out of line with quality of food.  Will never return or recommend.                                   Dining Room was empty of customers and should have been a clue."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place, even after the mixed reviews about service and food portions.  Before going into some details, let's just say we loved it and will certainly return in the future.  Consistent with other comments, there were only 3-4 other couples eating there during our visit, but it was a Tuesday evening, and we arrived shortly after 5:30.  Our server Emma was very pleasant, helpful, and informative in discussing the menu items, their preparation, and the spice level.  We ordered an appetizer, some naan, and two main dishes - the lamb korma and the chicken coconut.  Emma specifically asked us did we want our naan with our appetizer or with our main meal.  The chicken pakora appetizer was very good and was accompanied by two nice sauces.  The two entrees were absolutely fantastic and served about five minutes after we completed our appetizer.    My only minor issue was that I ordered the lamb dish at a seven spice level, which took a bit away from the lamb flavoring.  We ordered the chicken coconut at a five spice, which was perfect for us.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entire experience and will return.  We hope to have Emma as our wonderful server for our next visit.  Leo"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  It was a Saturday night, but the place was not busy.  Probably only 4 other tables of diners, but we were seated at a ridiculously small table and not given water.  I finally got the attention of the hostess who brought us some.  Later the server came so we ordered drinks and appetizers.  Sadly, only one appetizer was delivered and the hostess (not the server) later admitted the other one we ordered had not actually been ordered.  Finally the second appetizer came out and then after what seemed like a very long time, our entrees.  By then, our naan was soggy and cold.   Never once did the server offer to re-fill our water glasses or bother to ask how our food was.  At the end of the meal, I finally flagged down the hostess carrying a water  pitcher and asked for a refill.  She re-filled my husband's glass, then ran out of water and never returned.  We finally got our bill, which was quite expensive for what it was, but the service and lack of ambiance were the main irritants.  The food was nothing special--in fact, my chicken biryani had large pieces of some spice (cinnamon, ginger or cloves?) in it that clearly had not been ground.  It was horrible to keep finding that in the food I was eating and dislodge them from my mouth because you just can't chew something that is like wood--for heaven's sake,,,grind it!!!  My husband's chicken tikka masala was average, but not memorable.  What was memorable was the worst dining experience ever and the ridiculously slow and inattentive service.  We live quite close to this restaurant, but would not recommend it, nor will we return ourselves."}
{"text":"Pathetic. The food was not good. The service was too slow and not cheering. Too expensive. Non veg has the raw smell. Would never go in my life again. Would not recommend anyone too."}
{"text":"Easily our fave Indian joint in town, deep rooted spices, never disappointed with any of the curries, samosas are divine and naan done right. A must try for all Indian cuisine lovers!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous Indian restaurant - the food is excellent.  I see some negative reviews on here about service, but I haven't experienced that.  I have usually had the same gentleman as my server who is always very attentive and friendly.  But really - go for the amazing food - everything from the naan, the sauces, the rice - it's so delicious.  I do agree that it is a bit pricey for the dishes, but then again, being in a North Scottsdale complex, the rent they need to cover is probably very high. I worry because it's never crowded when I go, and I think it's because it's not in a high traffic area.   But don't let the lack of full tables influence you - worth going if you love Indian or are even looking to try it for the first time - they have some very basic dishes and you can choose your spice level.  Great for vegetarians too!"}
{"text":"way over priced for what you get, the prawns were really small for 19.99 and the lamb chops, we order them medium rare and they came well done. waitress was overwhelmed. A waste for date night for sure, would of spent our 100.00 some where else if I would of know"}
{"text":"I have dined at Al Hamra once only, and found the food to be quite good.  Our waiter was truly knowledgable about Indian food, and was always attentive and efficient.  The naan was outstanding, and the lamb dishes were up to a pretty high standard.    I like restaurants that attempt a nice ambience, and they did achieve a step in that direction by having Indian music playing in the background at an appropriate volume.  But the dining room, other than the music, is pretty generic.  It certainly doesn't feel like an evening in Mumbai.  The chutneys I tasted were excellent, but they had no pickle, and no chili paste, so, as our meal progressed that became more and more frustrating.  Our excellent waiter stated there would be pickle coming in (from India) soon.  Of course, you can buy Indian pickle of several types in a good ethnic grocery store.  My rating of three stars is one star lower than I think the restaurant may deserve, but the atmosphere is really quite depressing.  There is a stripe around the dining room of chipped paint due to chair backs scraping the painted, plastered walls.  This could so easily be remedied by chair rail, or touch up paint.  The lighting from rafter mounted fixtures, and focused into \"hot spots\", hits the walls in every which way, and the lighting on the tables is just the little battery powered fake candles.  All of this adds up to a \"cheesy\" feeling in the dining room.    It wouldn't take much to turn Al Hamra into a truly nice place, if management should care enough to keep an eye on things."}
{"text":"We have dined here several times, but this is the first review. It would have had 4.5 stars in the past. We have never minded paying more because the quality of the food was so much better than any of the other Indian restaurants we have tried. We had chicken tikka, chicken korma, vegetable korma and a vindaloo. The chicken was over cooked and not even the sauce could disguise how dry it was. Lamb was good and the paneer naan and roti were excellent. We do not understand why we were asked how hot we wanted our meals, something never asked in a British Indian restaurant. A vindaloo is supposed to be spicy, and a korma is not. This vindaloo was not spicy at all. Service was very attentive. Because of our prior experiences, we will give it another try."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST Indian restaurant in Arizona, highly recommended, the food and service is over the top! Ask for Joe, he will take great care of you and all of your guests. I tried many Indian restaurants who asked me to right reviews for them and I didn't. However this restaurant I  decided to write a review for them because they deserve it!"}
{"text":"Waitress was very weird and pretty much unhappy for no reason? Got irritated over asking difference between two beer choices and how much rice we'd get for sharing 5 dishes as a family of 6. We were the only table there besides 1 older couple at the bar. The food was great but the waitress was just not \"with it.\""}
{"text":"Since I travel often to the Bay Area I am familiar with good Indian cuisine. In fact I consider Indian food to be amongst my favorites. Al Hambra is one of the only Indian places near us so we had to give it a whirl. Upon walking in the first thing you notice is that the place is big, clean, and lacks character.   The menu has the essentials you'd come to expect although the prices are high.  I feel each dish is $5 higher than typical, but that's why they do Groupons often.   The food took awhile to arrive, but we were in no hurry. The food was good overall although nothing stood out. We found the lamb to be dry suggesting its overcooked. The chicken tikka was just okay, but nothing I would order again.   So all and all the place is above average Indian food. Given the competition in the immediate area I am not so sure when we will return. It would definitely take another Groupon to bring us back."}
{"text":"Stoped by on Sunday night, only two tables in the place- bad sign. Harried & fustrated waitress- ordered a beer- out of stock, second choise out of stock asked for Chutney out of stock, ordered lamb kebob out of stock! I am seeing a trend here....  Had three entrees they were ok- I really wish there was a great indian place in Scottsdale- any recommendations?  give Al Ham ra a skip"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant for the food, but tonight our service was so bad that we will probably only do take-out in the future.  We had the Chicken Naan, the Chicken Tandoori, and the Lamb Masala, and everything was terrific.  I also thought the quality justified the prices.  On the downside, our waitress treated us so shabbily that it colored the entire evening.  We felt truly insulted and condescended to during the entire visit, and what started out as \"jokey\" behavior towards our table deteriorated to the point that we finally had to go to the bar just to get our checks so we could leave.  Sadly, our below average tips will probably be written off as being from \"cheap women diners\" rather than a show of our extreme dissatisfaction.  A truly disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I really wanted to rate this place higher because it is close to my house and a very clean restaurant.  I love Indian food and have eaten in many places in California.  But honestly I felt the quality of the food was not the best the food seemed heated up or warmed up again not fresh.  Yes and as the previous reviewers stated the portions are just small to medium and the prices are very high for what it offers.   I will probably frequent other restaurants in the meantime unless things change."}
{"text":"The food here is great, very authentic.  The service however is horrible.  Two of us ate here on a Saturday night, there were only two other tables and two waitresses, they both should be working somewhere else, preferably where they don't have contact with other people, their skills were really lacking for a hospitality business."}
{"text":"Best vegetable korma I have ever tasted, in any state or country. Granted, I've never eaten in India before. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"We have been to Al Hambra several times since moving to North Scottsdale.  We go about every other month for our Indian food \"fix\". Wait staff is always helpful navigating through the menu if you want to be adventurous or try something new. We usually get the chicken curry dishes or the Tiki Masala (chicken) because they are consistently very good. The sauces are very nice and creamy, wonderful to dip your naan bread in. The chicken in the sauced dishes is always tender and one serving from the menu if you have rice, an order of raita and an order of naan is plenty for two people for a lunch or average meal. The naan is alway served hot and has a nice pull texture to it. I would recommend this restaurant to those readers who enjoy Indian food. Also, be sure to let them know what spice level you want your food in case the wait staff forgets to ask.  We usually ask for a three to four there which presents itself as a nice kick to the sauce, but not overpowering so you don't enjoy all the wonderful spices and other ingredients while you have your meal. Very nice ambiance, nice cloth tablecloths, and spacing of the tables. Great place for a group of four to enjoy a nice conversation or for \"date night\". Never had a problem there with loud groups or anyone which was disrupting the meal of others. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 6:15pm.   There were a total of 3 other people inside, and this is a very large restaurant so it was odd to see that, especially in North Scottsdale on a Monday evening.  But that doesn't necessarily mean anything bad...  So we sat down, and were waited on by a young man who seemed very stiff and mechanical. He wasn't friendly and expressed no personality, again doesn't necessarily mean anything bad.   Upon taking our order at approximately 6:20, we waited. During the wait for our food the remaining patrons departed.  Sitting in the restaurant as the only guests, it seemed like we might have some good attention from the wait staff and receive our food in a relatively timely manner. We'd stopped in on a whim heading home from a meeting down town, but needed to get home to do some work before bed, so I was looking forward to our dinner.  Well, the attention and timely service certainly wasn't to be.   We waited 25 minutes for our appetizer (Indian chicken wings). Upon receiving them at 6:45, we waited another 25 minutes to receive our entrees.  When the Chicken Vindaloo and Lamb Korma arrived at 7:10pm, they were portioned into what I would estimate are 4oz shallow plates (not bowls, per se', more like deep plates).   So, the portioning for $19.99 was approximately 1/3 of what you might expect from the amazing and excellent Bombay House in Salt Lake City with prices about 30% higher.  So you get 1/3 the food, at a 30% premium over typical high-end Indian food.  OK, still not the end of the world if the food is excellent.  I'd rate the Chicken Vindaloo and Lamb Korma an 85 on a 100 point scale. Totally subjective, I get it, but it's the best way I can give you my opinion. The flavors were very good, and the textures were about what was expected, although it was considerably too salty, which may have been done on purpose so you wouldn't feel bad about eating such a small portion.  The basmati rice is served as a single 3 maybe 4 oz portion on a giant plate, further accentuating the tiny portions.  I went through 1/3 the Korma, and used up the entire portion of rice i was provided, so I looked for the server to ask for a bit more to finish my meal with.  He was watching the baseball game in the bar, with the volume up quite high so even though I was shouting at him (nicely) he didn't hear me. Eventually someone else walked in the door just to ask directions and when he turned I was able to get his attention.   He sauntered over slowly and I asked him if I could possibly get a bit more rice to finish my dish with. He said \"yeah\".  I saw him walk to the register and type something in. At that point I realized he was going to charge me for the rice. OK, I'm a believer in making a profit, but being married to a Filipina there's one thing I know and that is rice is very cheap.  The server brought another very large plate with a proportionally tiny dab of rice (about as much as you might fill into half a standard coffee cup, so not very much at all). When he dropped that off, he did not offer to clear any of the other plates that were still on our table from the appetizer or the first rice plate, which covered a large portion of the table.  When we were done eating, we waited another 15 minutes for the single server (with no other patrons in the restaurant) to come by and see if we needed anything. I asked for the check, he brought it, and of course at that point I realized he charged me another $3.50 for a single tiny portion of rice. I also asked if he would please pack my wife's remaining food portion to go.  He went and got a container, and lazily scraped it into a container, then put it in the bag. I asked if he was also going to package the remaining rice (of which there was about half the amount he'd brought to me as a second portion). He again said, oh yea, walked back and got another container as if I was unreasonable to ask (or he was not thoughtful enough to anticipate we would want to take with us). When I realized I'd been charged for the rice, it made his lack of thoughtfulness about packaging that up seem even more lazy.  In any case, we didn't complain about anything, just paid the bill, left a 20% tip (against my better judgement) and went home, figuring I'd say my piece here on Yelp since I didn't get the feeling comments face to face would have made any impact on their present or future performance.  Overall the food was \"good\" but the curries were significantly too salty, the food is definitely very overpriced per portion size, and the service was slow and lackluster in about every way it could have been.  We won't return, which is unfortunate because we love Indian food, and there are very few Indian restaurants (if any) north of Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Superb, food and service on the patio. All 4 of us enjoyed our dinner very much - lamb and chicken curries with basmati rice. Surprisingly the salads before the main course were superb and good sized."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there last week to try it for the first time. We really didn't like it and the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Great high-end indian restaurant in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area.  Expect to pay more for the location.  Order the tandoori chicken and anything vindaloo.  Dishes are pricey but good.  Service is great especially from the cute eastern european waitress (?).  Stay away if you are really hungry and on a budget."}
{"text":"Friendly service and comfortable setting.  Hasn't been crowded on any of our three visits during past month.  Consistently good food and value for the price.   We appreciate the diversity it has helped add to the Pinnacle Peak restaurant scene.  We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Al Hamra is a nice Indian food restaurant.  That sounds like a pretty basic statement but that's kind of the point.  My experience was not remotely bad nor was it remarkable.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly and I would give it four stars if it wasn't for the fact that one of the dishes we ordered was a lamb dish that was overcooked, but I took them home for leftovers and it was oddly better.    We got Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, and Lamb chops.  Chicken Tikka was exactly as I hoped and the Garlic Naan was perfect.  It was flavorful and on par with what Ive had at other establishments closer to home.   I wouldn't order the lamb chops again but id order curry dishes without any hesitation and be confident that they are good.  The lamb chops however as i said previously were overcooked.    If you are in the area than I would recommend trying it out.  Its a great looking place with great staff but unfortunately is hidden in the mastros complex so deep that its more word of mouth than anything else.  You certainly wouldn't drive by and know its there.  It is however absolutely worth trying if you have a craving for Indian food."}
{"text":"We eat here pretty regularly -- the food is consistently good and there are a good variety of options covering many regional dishes, including many great vegetarian options as you would expect for Indian fare.  I've been to India and Indian enclaves throughout Asia, and the food is consistent with the real thing.  The heat/spiciness is also consistent with how they serve it in India (i.e. hot is HOT) -- they ask for your your heat preference, so for your first visit you may want to dial it back a notch from what you might normally request locally.  The place is big and clean and bright, but as others note there's not a ton of character.  Service is friendly, and we come enough that they recognize us and welcome us back.  As some have noted it can be a bit slow at times (not always), but I think it's consistent with the food being prepped fresh to order."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! We had great service. The waiter was very helpful and friendly. He made great recommendations too. I had the lamb vindaloo and my husband had the chicken tiki masala. Both were very tasty. We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here before?  Service was friendly and attentive.  I asked for a recommendation on the level of spice and our server was spot on.  The food was absolutely fantastic!  Have the chicken tikka masala and you'll be happy, like I am."}
{"text":"I give them 5 Stars! This is real home made food. After a long day from work I enjoy ordering from Al Hamara carry out so I can enjoy this great food while I'm coming down from my long day at work. I am so blessed to have this quality Indian food. It's always fresh!!!! Hands down the best Indian restaurant in the entire State of Arizona.   I love Al Hamara!"}
{"text":"I've had better Indian food by far! Our food wasn't even that hot! This place was just OK....."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food, very fresh and subtley spiced and cooked, much better than most. Relaxed and upscale atmosphere, pretty busy on a Wed night, highly recommended"}
{"text":"This food here is very good , I live here but I've eaten Indian food in its adopted exported home ( London ) for 40 years and probably in 10 other countries too , I have always enjoyed the meals here but usually get takeout as I find the restaurant just to quiet ( you could hear a pin drop ) unless I'm bringing at least 4 people , the only other comment I have beyond enjoying the food is that it's over priced for the tiny portions but I assume their paying a lot for rent here , although the sq ft price of their rent shouldn't equate to the small portion size compared to other curry houses in Phoenix and scottsdale if they truly want to satisfy the clientelle .,  My second comment is general and not specific to this restaurant , and it's that only Indian restaurants in this country America ask you ( how many stars hot ) which I have to say I find bizzare and still laughable , they don't ask you this in a Mexican Reataurant ? vindaloo as we know is hot and Phall hotter and tikka masala is mild and you should never be asked how hot you want your curry dish as each recipe stands alone , Beyond those two comments I always enjoy the food here , pricey or not ."}
{"text":"I hadn't had Indian food in years and a group of us decided to make it our ethnic food choice for our get together.  I read the yelp reviews and we all went.  I can tell you it was all everyone said and more! The food, the friendly service and the very nice restaurant owner made our experience one to remember! The Chicken tiki masala, Samosas, lamb vindaloo and everything else was full of flavor and delicious! The Naan was to due for too. This is a place to put on your favorites list!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food! And definitely a nice change from all the Italian/American/BBQ places that otherwise dominate this area. The only drawback is slow service, so you have to come prepared for that. I think the wait is worth it. We had:  - Samosa - Tandoori Paneer - Chana Masala  - Aloo Gobhi - Paneer Tikka Masala - Garlic Naan & Roti  All were fantastic with the exception of the Tandoor Paneer, which was dry and flavorless compared to everything else. Every other dish comes bursting with authentic flavors, and everything is just so warm and satisfying for your tum.  Because everything was so good, I have a hard time imagining anyone going wrong here. I was definitely blown away by Al Hamra's food."}
{"text":"Nice people, great food.  A really nice white linen place.  Loved the chicken karachi, naan, samosas, chicken pakora.  Wife had a lovely red, I had a nice premium margarita."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now, and it does not disappoint. Everything I've had (mostly the lamb dishes) has been incredibly tasty and tender.   The staff at Al Hamra are very nice and attentive. They make good recommendations and don't hover over you as you eat. The decor is nice. Fairly standard, but not down-market by any means, after all, it is in a decent area surrounded by high-income rooftops.   The only problem I have is I wish more people would go. I've only been on weeknights so I can't speak to the (hopefully busy) weekend crowd, but this place could use a couple more people discovering it and becoming loyal customers. It is pricey, which may be a result of the location, but it's better than most other Indian places I've been.   Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were at the park behind Mastro's with the twins.  We decided to walk around this plaza to check out if there were any new places.  We saw this new Indian/Pakistani restaurant.  It looked really nice and I was not sure I wanted to subject them to my twins.  They are not bad, however they are two years old after all.  They were very nice and accommodating.  They were even gracious enough to remove the tablecloth.  My baby girl thinks she is a magician or something because she wants to pull tablecloths all the time.  We placed one order of Chicken Pakora for the twins.  I was not sure they would eat. Well, they gobbled it all up in seconds.  I couldn't believe it, so we placed a second order.  We also had the regular Naan and the Aloo Naan, both very yummy.  I had the samosas and my husband had the chicken karachi, very tasty.  We will be back it was a great experience.  I am so happy I don't have to travel miles and miles to find a great indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Indian food in North Scottsdale. Yea! Same corner as Mastro's and Walgreen's.  I'm looking to go again, and see if they rate another star, after the start up issues dissolve. I ordered Garlic Naam bread and Chicken Tika Masala. Both very good and nicely presented. Prices are reasonable, for this neighborhood. Only open for dinner, and no weekend buffet is planned yet."}
{"text":"I cannot stress enough how fantastic the food is at Al Hamra. I've been going to this place for years and it's by far my favorite Indian restaurant in AZ."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Indian restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Thus far we have been disappointed at the quality.  Al Hamra was a complete delight.  Lovely, simple, clean decor.  Polite service.  AND the food was delish.  So often I find Indian food is swimming in oil.  We had an eggplant curry and a chana massala and both were wonderful.  Their papadum and naan (especially) were wonderful.  If you are vegan or vegetarian and want a NICE meal, I would highly recommend this restaurant.  They can make your food spicey or mild.  And, if you have meat-eating friends there are many, many excellent selections.  So nice to eat in a civilized restaurant that offers tasty, well-prepared food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great food here.  I will say its a little pricey but I guess on par for the location.  I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"This is certainly the best indian fare in the area, but unfortunately they are only open for dinner. The restaurant itself is very large, well kept and clean. The atmosphere is a bit subdued and quiet and it seems as if the place is mostly almost always half empty (perhaps because its so large).  The food is quite good, I've tried many of the curries and tandoori dishes. My favorite dishes are their tikka masala and the shrimp tandoori. Take out is quick and easy. I would recommend this place to anyone that lives in the area and doesn't want to drive 30 minutes to The Dhaba (which is the best indian in Arizona in my opinion)."}
{"text":"Misleading advertising with Passport.  It is listed as a Passport member.  Management said membership expired and would not honor the discount.  Waitress was shown the Passport card before we ordered.  Very unprofessional and in my opinion shortsighted.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We had to wait 40 minutes for the waiter to acknowledge us. The food is ok"}
{"text":"have to change the rating just because I see them falling below 4 stars and they are for sure quality wise a 4-5 star place."}
{"text":"This place opened up about 2 months ago and checked it out last week for dinner.  First impressions:   - Enticing aroma of spices from the kitchen -  Clean but not much done in terms of atmosphere or decor:  a few key touches could spruce up the place.  Also, some music would help to set a relaxing setting -  Old and really old customer base -  Friendly service - Tandoori dishes were well prepared including Tikka Masala and the chutneys - Prices are high and naan is extra  Overall good place to go for Indian food in N. Scottsdale"}
{"text":"The food is consistently delicious, although high priced considering the service. Always seems like there's only 2 people working which probably suits them fine on a week night, but not a Friday. I had the shrimp tikka masala and it was spicy and delicious. It's a nice location, and a nice looking place."}
{"text":"Excellent northern Indian food.     Pricy but soooo good.   I order to take out about every two weeks.    Boti kebab, palak paneer, tandoori chicken, Chana masala, samosa..... all very solid and as good as you will find anywhere!"}
{"text":"Darn it. The food here is so good; however, tonight we had the waiter from h%##. First he told my husband that the napkin goes on his lap, next my husband asked the difference between two dishes and the waiter directed him to the descirptions on the menu, but the straw that broke the camel's back was when he told our 5 year old to have a drink and relax. Whoa, What? Never again. We did complain to the manager, Mario, he was sorry but what could he do? Fire the guy, I hope he does. I won't go back until he does."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner here.  Even though the restaurant was busy and they only had two staff on, the service was quick.  I had the chicken tikka masala, delicious.  Hubby had the lamb, very tender.  We will return again."}
{"text":"Yeah, the best Indian cuisine we have had in Arizona. When we asked for our meal to be a 9 out of 10 on the spice meter, they didn't just throw in a bunch of cayenne pepper. The flavors and textures we full and well developed. The Naan was thick and fluffy with just the right amount of char. My one criticism would be portion size. Our entrees were much more sauce than goodies but the sauces were so good we didn't complain. We will most certainly be back, oh and the service was just fine. When my husband told our server that the beer was flat \" go ahead and try it\" he commanded, the server did! What more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"Had a restaurant.com coupon and decided to try it for New Years Eve.  Food was good but at the end of the meal the server indicated that the owner would not honor the coupon.  Ironically only 3 tables were occupied but we were told it was a \"special day\" even though there was no exclusion on the coupon for certain dates.  Two of three dishes were good but pricing seems high.  Due to not honoring the coupon we will never be back.  Restaurant.com asked us to review the restaurant.  Our review is send me a coupon for somewhere else!"}
{"text":"No lack of flavors at this restaurant.  The naan was some of the best I've ever had.  Other notables were the Bhindi Masala, Palak Paneer, and Aloo Ghobi. The Tandoori meats were delicious. All items are cooked to your spice level, we chose four and that was plenty.  Halfway through dinner, I shifted into sport-eating mode and got myself one helluva tummy ache on the drive home, it was that good.  I'm paying for it today.  Well, not really.  My wife is."}
{"text":"I love this place. My sister and I frequent here when we're bored with the usual burger, sushi, blah. The wait staff is always super attentive and ready to assist with recommendations. I always get the buttery chicken at a level 3 and have enough left over for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! My fianc√© is Indian and the dishes we had tasted like his mom's cooking! Hands down best Indian food I be had at a restaurant and very nice staff& service - definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great authentic Indian food. In Arizona I'd say this place is as close as you're going to get for real Indian cuisine and it totally delivers. They have a lot of great vegetarian and vegan dishes. My personal favorite is the aloo gobi curry and the roti. My family also loves the mango chicken curry which is pretty unique. I love how you can customize the spice level to your liking usually I get mine at about 7 or 8 and it is pretty spicy. If you don't like spice I would recommend a 3. The food here also reheats really well! We usually get takeout and I rarely see people sitting down to eat but they have a nice open dinning room. I would think it might be a bit awkward if you were the only one eating since it is pretty open and very quiet so I would suggest takeout. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a bit of middle eastern inspired food."}
{"text":"My wife is Indian so we don't think this is some white guy that does not understand indian food.  Al Hamra is a little overpriced but the food is pretty good.  The service is a little slow but not too bad.  The chicken is alright but their lamb is high quality!  Any lamb dish will do but i usually get the lamb vindaloo, very delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant and I don't understand why it isn't busier. The location is great being just off of Pinnacle Peak and Pima Rd. Unlike many Indian restaurants the decor, crystal, plates, silverware are really nice and elegant. They have lovely indoor and outdoor dining options.  The cuisine is simply outstanding. The quality of the sauces, meats, vegetables is top notch. Our waitress was delightful and the owner/manager came to our table and he was very nice and knowledgeable about his cuisine and Indian cuisine in general.  This place has to catch on because I get the feeling that if it started getting packed, it would be one of the more popular restaurants in Northern Scottsdale. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I was born and raised in the sub-continent so my expectations are quite different from the average Joe who's view of authentic Mexican food isTaco Bell or of authentic Italian pizza is Pizza Hut. I provide these qualifications because my comments may be from a very different perspective. For American Indian food it's okay. For the real old country food it deserves no more than a 1 star. S that's the story."}
{"text":"I have been twice. The first time was during their pre-grand opening and the food was good. I went back again last week. The food was fantastic. I eat home cooked indian vegetarian food couple times a week so I'm picky. The vegi dishes were twice as good as any other indian place in AZ. The price is higher, but reasonable for the location. The roti and naan is also very good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for amazing Indian food, then you've come to the right place. Every single dish we've gotten here has been exquisite, and the seasonings are so interesting! Not to mention the naan is also to die for- they have so many types too!! The food may take a little longer than one is used to, but I assure you, it's well worth it! The atmosphere is quiet, relaxing, and dark- perfect for a date night!"}
{"text":"Decent Food, Nice Location and Ambiance, Good Service, Pricey...  Standard North Indian Curry Selections, nothing fancy or exotic here. However food tastes good. The Naan was really good. I will definitely go there again. It is the closest one I found to my home."}
{"text":"Came in with my girlfriend on a Friday night and the place was DEAD. We were the only two in the entire place and I don't get it, the food was fantastic. The service was pretty good too, very friendly.  The chicken in my chicken tikka masala was perfect. My only regret is not ordering a vindaloo, as it is sometimes difficult to find one hot enough, but their 7 actually cleared my sinuses out. It's out of the way, but I will definitely be back to try a vindaloo at some point."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Service is great. I love spicy food and I love how they ask you how spicy you want your food on a scale of 1-10I've eaten in and had take-out as well. The take-outs are always put together very well. The garlic naan is amazing! So is the Tawook and Scwarma!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the selection is good, the atmosphere is pleasant, and the wait staff is attentive. Enoy!"}
{"text":"We drive 30 mins for their CTM and garlic naan. It's my \"death bed\" meal. The only food that makes me soooo happy to eat. My husband had never had Indian food and probably would have never had it for the rest of his life if it wasn't for me taking him to this place. He's just as obsessed as I am."}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this Indian restaurant. The tikka masala and shrimp vindaloo are amazing. My parents get the lamb chops every single time. Make sure you select a 1-2 lower spice level than you would normally have. A 4 is perfect for me, and I like spice!"}
{"text":"Palak Paneer and Benghan Bartha were wayyy too salty for anyone's taste. Not sure if it was MSG or salt but it left us feeling a little ill after dinner and we could barely eat any of it.  The garlic naan was delicious and the rice was good. The waitress seemed hurried and not as hospitable as one would expect."}
{"text":"We had dinner here the other night and really enjoyed ourselves.  The food was very good and the service was excellent.    Have not had much luck with Indian restaurant.  This was a very welcome surprise."}
{"text":"We had a family dinner there with a one year old, a three year old and four adults.  Excellent patient service with excellent food.  A thoroughly enjoyable evening.  Update - 5/14:  In checking their menu on line it appears as if they took a sharp price increase.  SO much so it caused us to go to another Indian restaurant and get another dish or two for the same price.  I;m sure the food is still great but they've lost us as customers.  Too costly."}
{"text":"We just returned from dining at Al Hamra with friends and had to comment on the great meal and service we had.  Mario, our waiter, was knowledgeable and friendly.  Our orders came promptly and all were excellent.  We ordered the samosas and onion paneer for appetizers.  We had the shrimp vindaloo, the chicken with coconut, the chicken curry and the eggplant dish along with aloo naan and mango chutney.  All had the right amount of spice as ordered and were tender and very tasty.  It's been several years since we dined at Al Hamra but we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good food... worst service on earth.   Staff has no idea what is in their food.   Manager argued when we got bill with multiple errors.   Too bad we will never go back because of horible experience because food was pretty good.  Walked out shaking our heads at how poorly trained the staff is."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food.  This is what Scottsdale is lacking.  Slightly pricey and they charge for some of the extras you get for free at other Indian restaurants.  But overall very very good.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had the Lamb Vindaloo spice level 9 which was hot how I like it, and two Manhattans. Fantastic. Ambiance is superb."}
{"text":"Was just in AZ for vacation with my mom and went here after purchasing a restaurant.com gift certificate. We thoroughly enjoyed it.   Location seems off the beaten path-at least for us tourists staying in north phoenix. Definitely hard to find in the dark- thank God for gps!   We went on a Sunday night- place was fairly dead. I think there were only 2 other tables dining while we were there. It is a fairly large restaurant-esp for being in a shopping center.   We ordered the samosas, regular naan, chicken Lorna for me and coconut chicken for my mom. The samosas and naan were the best I had ever had. The naan was super light, fluffy and warm. The samosas had a nice crunchy outside- not soggy and chewy like at a lot of other Indian restaurants. The chicken was cooked perfectly- very tender and sauce had a lot of flavor. I've dined at several Indian restaurants (in Boston primarily) and this was my favorite. My mom had only had Indian once before (with me in Boston) and she didn't care for it so she was hesitant to try it again but she really liked it. Although neither of us were starving when we got there, I still think the portions were enough for 2 meals.   Our waitress was quiet and shy to start but warmed up after awhile. We ended up really liking her- she was quite friendly. I don't recall her name but she was from Serbia.   Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ordered on the website they link to, beyondmenu.com. I showed up after they didn't answer the phone when I called. They said they didn't get the order until just then and it would be 30 minutes. There is no manager but the chef who was too busy to listen to my complaint. There are maybe 5 full tables out of 30 on Mother's Day these guys are acting like they have never been so busy. Really disappointed nobody owned the crappy experience or even said sorry they give zero concern for customer experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food, love that it is made in olive oil. The chef customizes to your taste pallete, spice level and allergies, less oil etc. Highly recommend it as an Indian."}
{"text":"The food is simply exquisite! Everything on the menu is. delicious. The ambiance is lovely and easy to have a conversation. It is my favorite Indian food ever!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in AZ. Chicken tikka masala made with coconut milk is an absolute must."}
{"text":"Went there last night with a group. Everyone really liked the food and the service was excellent. We shared 5 different dishes. The lamb masala was particularly good, as was the tandoor chicken tikka.  This is the best Indian food we have found in the valley (our group has been to many Indian restaurants in England, Canada and elsewhere). The decor is a little plain, but is clean and new."}
{"text":"How lucky we are to have such wonderful Indian cuisine right in our neighborhood. We have eaten here several times and have yet to leave disappointed, or hungry!!!  We have eaten a wide range of dishes here, from Veg to lamb to chicken and all have been made with quality ingredients and terrific flavors.   I like spicy, and a 7 or 8 on the spicy ladder is perfect here. My wife is more inclined to go for a 2. But either way, the dishes always taste fantastic."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner here last evening. Very good service and we enjoyed the meal, although I agree with the review about heat/spiciness. We ordered at \"7\" and it might have been better at \"5\" -- we live in New Mexico!"}
{"text":"That really good Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area has eluded us - we've tried at least 10 that were supposed to be \"it\". So this time no one recommended Al Hamra - it's just been on my way home for as along as it's been open. It was worth stopping - very good lamb vindaloo (spice level 7 - packing some heat) and a variety of other dishes that we tried. My wife liked the samosa but I was thinking 'so so'. All in all the chef has a fine touch and the food is very solid and well above average, although a bit pricey (as you might expect for the location). Most of the recommendations by others seem spot on. Recommended."}
{"text":"Superb cuisine, excellent service (Thank you Radika). Had the chicken Korma and onion naan. Flavors were simply out of this world. Just surprised to walk in on a Saturday night with reservations to find a nearly empty dining room! Radika was a sweetheart and just very accommodating."}
{"text":"Oh Al Hamra, i love your chicken tikka masala and naan like no other. The service is wonderful and the decor delightful, and the wine list extensive, but please....forbthe love of god....play some music.  It is so quite in there that the other patrons discussions, clear across the room seem loud and distracting.  They need music to create ambience and privacy. Its almost akward."}
{"text":"The food is good but one thing seems to be the same. The staff seems slightly unpleasant and unfriendly ... I don't understand what kinda stick is jabbed up their butts, but the samosas are superb ... Not sure what's with the tasteless smooth jazz? It's an Indian restaurant not a hotel lobby, where are the Dhuns?!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  Unique.  Service was a bit slow and I'd say it's on the pricey side (expect $20+ entrees)."}
{"text":"Second try for AL Hamra and again we really liked it.  Great flavors, lots of spice.  I'd agree with a previous poster that there is alot of sauce for a relatively small amount of meet, but the sauce is soooo good all you need is a little more rice or naan and you are good to go!  This time tried the samoas - deep fried so not my favorite, like the m baked better.  Also the Lamb Byrini was just OK, the rice was  a little greasy for my taste.  However the chicken curry and Paneer tilkka masala were spot on and very delicious.  Plus some ofhte best garlic naan I've ever had.  We'll definately go backand it is nice to have some good ethnic alternatives in the far North Valley."}
{"text":"Amazing food !!!!!!!! Warning the service is a tad slow , or understaffed but the deliciousness of the food still keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This place is in a good location, it looks very nice inside, and I would not mind a nice celebration there.  The staff is dressed very formal, and there is an air of low tone and low lighting.  We had lamb curry, chicken curry,  and chicken coconut curry.  The favorite was the coconut curry.  I was not especially fond of the lamb curry becuase the lamb was a bit stiff and dry.  I don't think they cooked it very recently.  The portions were suprisingly small.  The pricing is quite a bit higher that I would have thought it would be when I looked through the menu, but when I saw small portions I thought this is hopefully excellent quality.  It was good, but I have to say that I have had better and we were probably paying for the staff to dress up and the very high rent... both good reasons to pay a little more for a meal, but it does not draw me back to the place.  We have numerous better options that we will probably stick with."}
{"text":"Delightful restaurant!  Had the lamb sagg (4.5 heat) and my daughter had the chicken tiki marsala (6 heat). We both enjoyed the selection and appreciated the free appetizer with sauce (7 heat) to know how to gauge the heat index. The garlic naan was outstanding! And our server was friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this restaurant! We went here because the restaurant next-door was closed. It was such a pleasant surprise. Sadly it is not usually very full, but the service is amazing and the food is to die for! We always get the Tandoori Wings and the naan (garlic and chicken and both great). I've had several dishes there and am always so pleased each time. My husband loves the curry and I usually get the Shrimp tiki masala. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nearly full restaurant on my visit.  Very polite service.  They take their heat seriously, as the mint chutney was a solid 7 on a scale of 1-10.  Saag and Chana Masala were flavorful and good portions.  Plain Naan is the winner on the bread menu, for price and taste.  Didn't care for the garlic naan so much.  Restaurant is tucked behind two other restaurants, a Lamp Pizza place and a Bistro.  Easy to miss.  Prices are insanely steep and beyond the norm for this area.  Entrees include \"premium\" rice.    Dinner only."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant and happy it was open on July 3rd, as many restaurants near it were closed.  It was quiet when we walked in, but people started coming in later and it was picking by the time we left. We were greeted right away and our service continued to be very prompt.  We started with the samosa and the garlic naan which was delicious.  Next we had the Tandoori Chicken Tikka and the Palak Aloo- both our favorites.  We also had the chicken korma and the lamb boti- also very yummy.  They offer a spice spectrum of 1-10 and we chose 3 and 4's, but next time I would go a little higher. Everything was very flavorful and fresh. My only hesitation is that their prices are a little high,  likely due to the location. Our bill for 4 people was just over $100. I will return, but not as often as I would like due to the price."}
