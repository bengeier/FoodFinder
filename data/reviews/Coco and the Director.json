{"text":"Sometimes I come here to read a book, and it's especially cozy when you get a window seat and have the sun shining on your back while it's cold outside. It's pretty quiet here during the day so I like coming when I feel like  taking a walk and a break from the office.  All their drinks are pretty overpriced, but their ambience is on point. How can I describe it? The wooden paneling give it a rustic vibe, but it kind of also has a modern vintage twist. Littered throughout the store are also offerings of vintage-type goods (they were/are selling a typewriter) as well as cards (think birthday cards) and they use barrel as display tables. The staff are really nice, and they don't kick me out if I want to just stop by and sit down to absorb the ambience.  The only menu item I've tried so far is their mint tea which they brew using tea leaves and not a tea bag. But that also justifies a price hike, about $5 for a normal cup of tea. I might as well order the leaves online. I have yet to get the expensive coffee here, but when I do, I'll give an update."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by this place for breakfast....really cool place to lounge around in, someone really thought about the interior design of this place.   Got a breakfast sandwich - chicken sausage something on a bagel, really dry, the bagel was toasted and half was super hard to the point of being inedible, not sure if they tried to toast a stale bagel back to life but something was off... Almond croissant was really good.   Coffee....I thought these guys knew what they were doing....nice machine, baristas wearing the leather aprons...its all for show though....ordered two cappuccinos, both came out very hot, one came out sour the other bitter, zero sweetness in either, milk was frothed super foamy, maybe this is their style but....I don't like it...asked to redo one of the cappuccinos, and the third one was a little less sour, but this cup had half the liquid volume but more crazy foam.... I see a lot of people raving about their pour overs, maybe this is their thing, but if you want a good cappuccino then Not Just Coffee or Central Coffee are way better."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. The ambiance... absolutely beautiful, cool snacks and odds and ends you can pick up.  The decor is awesome, the take a book leave a book rack, the projector, the spaces for group projects, all awesome points! The layout makes you never want to leave the place. I stopped in for some tea around 2pm and ONE barista was working. I ordered a hot tea and a muffin, total TWENTY TWO minutes to receive my order and I was the second in line when I came in! I found the pastries a bit over priced considering Amelies sells the exact items in a larger portion, for a cheaper price... and we all know how expensive Amelies is. I finally get my tea and I ask for my muffin and the Barista says i'll get it.... ***waits for 2 minutes** never attempts to get my muffin. I ask another girl behind the counter (who is not really helping the line which has grown since I came in) to give me the muffin she manages to give it to me. No organization, no communication, bad service... I won't be back. Too many other coffee shops with far better service in uptown."}
{"text":"Great service, great tasting Americanos. The girl barista working this afternoon by the main door was great. I didn't catch her name. Thanks for the hospitality. :) It will run you around $3 for a basic drink but it's much tastier than Starbucks."}
{"text":"Cute hangout place in uptown. It's pretty much like a Starbucks; coffee, tea and bakery items. Jaimish was really patient and friendly. This was our first time here and he took time to explain the menu and recipes which was was very welcoming! His co-worker was also kind and patient They make their own syrups which is a plus! The drinks are really tasty and without unnecessary sugar!  Had the mocha latte and you can taste the cocoa, didn't taste just like hot cocoa which was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Next level coffee shop!  Love this place!  The two-level space is amazing.  Lots of different areas to congregate and people watch along the windows on Trade St.  Unique and eclectic interior.  Kudos to the design team!  Nothing like it in Charlotte!  The intersection of Trade and Tryon looks like it will be the next hot location with Coco, Essex across the street and the new Bank of America Plaza opening next Spring.  I had a cinnamon and brown sugar latte which was amazing.  I picked out the banana bread from the bakery display.  It was delicious and totally different than the typical sliced loaf.  This was more cake-like and lighter with a crumble topping.  I saw a lot of other things I would like to try next time.  They also have some sandwiches and salads.  Prices are very reasonable.  I hate to say it but this place really puts Starbucks to shame."}
{"text":"visiting a day and found this treasure of a coffee shop.  The coffee is wonderful.   The atmosphere and decor and unique and delightful.  Would love to come back."}
{"text":"I've tried vanilla latte here three times, it tasted like shit. if you are a coffee person, don't go to this place."}
{"text":"I feel like an idiot that this place has literally been across the street from where I have worked and I have never noticed it!! Coco and the Director has been on my Charlotte Bucket List since it opened. However, I didn't ever look up where it was at. So, on Friday night, we were walking around Downtown and this place caught my eye. Since, we randomly found it, we had to stop in as it was definitely a sign!  Coco and the Director serves coffee, wine, beer, sandwiches, salads, dips, etc. Inside is very nicely decorated with lots of fun stuff for sale! Tons of different tables and chairs. On this particular occasion, we just grabbed a beer. However, I want to go back for lunch to check out some of the salads!  I absolutely loved the stadium seating inside. We enjoyed our beers while listening to a couple play music (seems like they have entertainment here alot). I noticed they had a big screen projector in front of the stadium seating and saw they showed movies here.   This place is just so unique, especially given it's location of right in the middle of Uptown. I cannot wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Unique! Love this new spot. With little signage and no outdoor seating it may not look like much from the outside, but the inside is another story. It's VERY big. There is stadium seating (a favorite for pictures) with a big screen TV, an upstairs with a few tables, a row lining the window, around the corner is another area with quieter working spaces or big group seating tables. They sell fantastic coffee and Charleston Plantation teas. They also make homemade unique sandwiches. A few pastries and sweets are in the case by the register. They also have healthy or fun prepared options like brownies or a superfood salad. I would highly recommend coming here to work on you screenplay, do some homework, or meet with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in this coffee shop. Perfect place to relax and get lost in a book. They also host a ton of fun special events (movie nights, trivia, live music, coloring, art shows and more)!"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving weekend stayed at the Marriott City Center. Coco is a great cafe and awesome alternative for anyone who loves small coffee houses and also mainstream Starbucks. I got the dirty chai latte. The chai was spicy and yummy with the caffeine kick that I desperately needed. The only downfall was that the largest size I could order was a 16 oz.  I also ordered a Kronut - croissant/donut. It had numerous layers that were flaky like a croissant, but it was much much heavier than a donut. I swear it weighed over a pound lol.I chose the pecan. It was delicious as it was flaky and soaked in a syrup, but not too sweet."}
{"text":"I discovered Coco and the Director while searching on Yelp one day for coffeehouses.  \"What's this?\" I thought.  \"A gigantic coffeehouse with stadium seating?  How did I not know of this?!?  And who are Coco and the Director?\"  So one Sunday afternoon, we decided to venture into Uptown to check it out.  First, let me preface my story by saying that I am not a football fan (yeah, sorry), so I do not keep track of game days.  Second, let me say that going on any Sunday into Uptown during football season (the fall/winter months when you most likely want hot coffee) is a crap shoot unless you know the Panthers are playing out of town.  We drove around for about 20 minutes looking for a (free) parking space.  (I wasn't going to pay $20 to park, the going rate during a game, just to get a cup of coffee.)  After circling for quite some time and going down one one-way street to the next, we finally found an available parking spot on the street.  It was about 1/2 mile away, but it felt like 2 miles after driving so long.    So now we're there.  It wasn't super busy, most likely because of the impossible parking situation.  Upon entering, you're blown away by the size of the place and the amount of detail that was put into it.  It's truly an amazing establishment.  There are rooms with comfy chairs (even a conference table) tucked behind the main room as well.    I ordered a mocha and we split a cronut.  For it not being busy, it took much longer than Starbucks to get our drinks.  And, sadly, my mocha was just tepid.  The taste was ok, but it was really lacking the warmth I was craving.  The refrigerated cronut was just ok, too.  I'm not sure if they're made on premises, but most likely they come pre-packaged.  I certainly wouldn't get it again or spend that much ($6).  It wasn't out-of-this-world, it wasn't super fresh, and it wasn't that big (did I mention it was $6?).    So while I wasn't truly impressed by the food or drink quality, I give Coco and the Director four stars for its amazing atmosphere alone.  (I knocked off that extra star because of the food and drink.)  I might come back if I happen to be Uptown in the future in the morning or afternoon, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way, especially on a game day."}
{"text":"The coffee is good depending on the barista. Some days it will be amazing and others it will be worse than Dunkin Donuts. Some don't really understand what 30 pounds means."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance and perfect location. Be warned, staff is rude every single time I have been in there. None of them seem like they want to be there. With such a warm ambiance, it's too bad their human capital makes it seem so cold."}
{"text":"Sooo, I love little coffee shops, but this one is next level. Coolest place to pop in and chill or get some work done."}
{"text":"Great place to get work done on the mezzanine, or have a chill out session on the cushioned stairs. The staff are so friendly and helpful, and the kronuts are amazing!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. It took about 20 minutes to get an iced coffee in a five person line.  Coffee is either not a good quality or it wasn't brewed correctly as it tasted both watery and bitter.  For this price you are much better off getting Not Just Coffee or Amelies' Coffee down the street."}
{"text":"Great to get away from your desk and work with a tasty cup of coffee and one of those kronuts! New flavors daily and the staff is impeccable!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot, great for studying. I had a meeting there today and it was loud enough to give you privacy but not crazy loud. They were super helpful in making sure i was happy with my drink. I would go back."}
{"text":"I try to find a new coffee shop every Sunday to sit and write. I finally made it to Coco to see what it was all about. I must say that the pictures of the \"stadium\" seating is what really had me needing to come here. I also entered with the expectation that the prime seating would likely be crowded, it was. Yet I found a cozy spot tucked away in the back at a huge table...alone!  I ordered a coffee and a matcha cronut. I was anxious to try it because well, it's a cronut! Who doesn't like croissants and donuts, and a mash-up of the two couldn't be bad. I will say that the cronut was a bit sweet for me. Specifically, the green icing on the top and then the additional icing that filled the middle. I don't think it was needed. I also felt it was a little too greasy. I don't think I'd order another cronut based on my experience with this one.   In addition, one of the reasons why it had taken me so long to visit this place is because it's in the heart of the city and I knew parking would be difficult. Well, I spent $18 on parking alone. Do they validate? I guess it's a little late for me to ask that question. That was the only thing that will make me less likely to come back, not unless I rent a scooter, bike, or public transportation.   Overall, I think Coco is a very cool place to just sit and have coffee and write. I really wish it was in a different location with private parking."}
{"text":"If I had to pick a coffee shop in Uptown, this will always be my choice. They have decent coffee, smoothies from Green Brothers, food options and just an awesome space with my favorite being their staircase seating. I love to just plop down on a couple pillows and work away. Plus they have outlets everywhere which is a definite positive! My least favorite thing is their bathroom location since they connect thru the hotel lobby but it's not the worst thing. Just feels weird if I wanted to leave my stuff there while I do my business outside of their establishment haha. Overall tho, if I lived in Uptown, I'd be here literally everyday to work."}
{"text":"By far one of the best new places in Charlotte.  Coco and the Director does not disappoint.  A unique blend of trend, community. collaboration and quality.  If you're looking for a great environment with fun and eclectic style, this is it.  If you're looking for high quality coffee, tea, and sweets, this is it.  If you're looking for a lunch menu that thinks outside the box but doesn't have you under your desk napping by three pm, this is it.  And most of all if you are looking for a great customer service experience where all are welcome and they make you feel like family, this is it.  Whether I've there to add a little noise and creative flow to my office days or stopped by for an evening out - Coco and the Director has yet to disappoint.  I'm excited to get back there again soon... and hopefully I'll meet you there!"}
{"text":"It's places like this that make me wish I worked in uptown. Coco and the Director is a trendy coffee shop that also serves some food and alcohol. While the decor screams Portland, it features a well thought out interior that has many work spaces (and outlets), huge open layout, and stadium seating for the occasional small concert. My wife and I swung in here on a whim on Friday night and were pleased to stumble upon a small concert and enjoyed a beer in the stadium seating. Overall a very enjoyable and relaxing experience. I would love to use the space during the day to get a coffee and plug into work to knock some stuff out. Overall a really cool space - especially since it is so un-charlotte and right in the middle of town. Props to the owners for having the vision and confidence to bring this neat concept to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the vibe of this place. Coffee is better at some other places, but I love to sit at Coco and enjoy a cup while catching up on some work out of the office. Their sandwich options are limited (one per day) but they're really good. As for the coffee, I think it's maybe just a lack of experience or skill that makes the other places a bit better. Pour over was cold by the time it finished. Latte was muddy. Americano was weak. Cold brew is pretty solid, but the others are a bit lacking."}
{"text":"Disappointment. I came in with high expectations after reading some of the reviews and hearing people rave about it over social media. The location is great and the interior is so unique. With elevated seats, it creates a spacious yet cozy environment that welcomes its guests to sit down and get whatever they need to get done done.   The menu is rather small. There are not many options at all. For such a creative space, I would like to see a comparably creative menu. I settled on a latte because I just love lattes. The guy who rang me up seemed like he hated his job and neither of the employees seemed like they wanted to be there. After placing my order, he forgot to write it down and then asked me to repeat it (which is okay, like no hard feelings haha). He said he had a rough morning, which I totally understand. The person who made my drink told me she tried to make my latte art into a heart, but it's more like a peach now. I kinda just shrugged it off. Now to the actual coffee: bland. There is no distinct flavor of espresso at all. The coffee is just not good in my opinion. I felt like I wasted my money on my cup.   The place is aesthetically pleasing, but not fulfilling for a coffee lover like me."}
{"text":"Incredible sandwich, brisket fried jalapenos Chipotle BBQ sauce pickles onions. Better brisket than I've had anywhere in the country. Atmosphere was great, staff were friendly, coffee legit."}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere, decor and location. Food and coffee are meh. The brewed coffee was very weak. I bought one today (3rd visit) - tasted it, discarded it, went to another coffee shop nearby and returned with a better cuppa. Good place to hang out, work and collaborate a bit - just not good coffee."}
{"text":"This place has a unique decor design. The staff was nice and they had a small but simple menu. I had a flat white  and almond croissant. The almond croissant was amazing. The flat white was good but I was disappointed in the size for the price (8 oz for around 4+ dollars).  Great atmosphere and a good place to study or relax for a short time."}
{"text":"We made a day trip up to Charlotte. As we were headed back to the car this was the only coffee shop still open. So glad we got to stop in. Wish we had more than 20 mins. The atmosphere was so inviting. We relaxed on The comfy pillows and drank some really good coffee. The barista was wonderful. She was so friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Look up dickster in Urban dictionary and you'll get the idea...waterbean is hip and nice....as opposed to Coco where the staff...or at least one of them is a d*#k!!"}
{"text":"There are only 2 things stopping me from giving 5 stars... 1)the cream container is evil. More than once it has spilled waaaaaay too much in my drink and killed it and 2) the charge hits my credit card as Marriott and it confuses me every time! But the sandwiches are awesome as are the people who work there and the coffee they make!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and kind staff. It is pricy but I like to come and study. There are tons of outlets and places to sit. The almond croissants are great!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and saw (online) that CoCo and the Director had a free art night. I was very disappointed when I arrived and only found two coloring books wth broken colored pencils and a broken pencil sharpener.   I did not try any of their food or drinks due to the disappointment in the art supplies so I am unable to comment.   The atmosphere/sitting arrangements/decor was great."}
{"text":"Loved this place, went for the first time today after work and WOW. First of all this place looks pretty unique, the interior design, furniture, wooden decks with pillows, tables on second floor, well at least Charlotte doesn't have much unique looking coffee places after Amelie's. They also serve wine and beer and they have a small selection of pastries. We tried the pumpkin croissant and it was delicious ($2 - half price pastries today yay!!) and had Dirty Chai Latte - it was alright. Nice staff, interactive and lots of people were coloring something and having wine today some kind of \"adult coloring and wine\" day I think.  Above all it's the ambience that we would want to go back again."}
{"text":"Not really the biggest fan of the espresso here. It has a very intense, almost burnt flavor. I've tried a few different variations of their latte, as well as their mocha, but none of them were that great. The atmosphere here is wonderful, however. There is tons of natural light and the set up can either function as professional or casual. They have a lot of pre-packaged drinks and snacks if you aren't a coffee fan."}
{"text":"Kronuts, kronuts, kronuts!!!!  I must admit, yeast-based baked goods are my Kryptonite. While you might not expect to find good food in a hotel lobby, Coco has a lot of great quick grabs that'll have you wanting to come back. It must be something in those dang kronuts because I swear that I'm bewitched.  Let's break down the star of the show. First of all, these kronuts aren't golden brown, they're dark brown. A lot of caramelization is happening here, and with it a lot of flavor. They've done a great job folding this dough and when you get one you can peel the layers off individually and try to make it last as long as possible. As for myself, I like to get a bunch of layers together because I love the crunchy texture outside, and flaky inside.  I've had the cold brew a couple of times as well. It's a great, low-acid option for those that need their caffeine fix pronto. The staff is such a pleasure and it's not just your usual retail chit chat, I love a team that engages with their customers.  They do seasonal specials and sandwiches for lunch and next time, really next time I promise I'll forego the sweets in favor of trying something new, maybe... but those pastries, they're calling me!  As others have said, parking is a bit difficult. If you're riding into Charlotte I suggest the Lynx light rail and just leaving your car at one of the many park & ride locations. The CTC/Uptown station is a mere two blocks away from Coco, just walk through the Epicentre corridor, down the stairs, and walk across Trade and Tryon, Coco is on the corner that the Halal cart is always at.  If you're looking for a place to bunker down with a book or laptop for an hour or so, Coco has you covered. If you just need your coffee, they're a real crowd-pleaser!"}
{"text":"Coco and the Director is my go to coffee spot with clients in Uptown. They have a great shared workspace that you can reserve in advance as well as lots of tables upstairs. In addition, the music is not blaring so you can easily have a great conversation without yelling.   The coffee is super fresh and the espresso is smooth. My go to lately has been the latte with soy milk. Super frothy and enough sweetness without adding any sugar to it.   I haven't had their food yet, but they always have a featured Sandwich of the Day for around $9-$12. Their baked good also look grand, which they mentioned they get from some local bakeries. The one that always catches my eye is the cronut. One day I will eat my guilt and order it... one day."}
{"text":"Super neat interior located in a building lobby. Barista was super nice...so nice she convinced me to get a pastry (or two).   Ordered a cappuccino with almond milk -- my first cappuccino and wasn't the largest fan, but still acquiring the taste. Everything else was great!"}
{"text":"Wow, never expected to find this gem downtown. Spacious sitting areas, ability to reserve a table for a coffee group, and great coffee!  Love the decor!"}
{"text":"I had the smoked brisket with sriracha bbq sauce, red onions and pickles. I asked for the bbq sauce on the side, cause I was unsure of the heat level.  After I placed my order I was told by the sandwich chick to go to the register, I thought to pay but no, waited for the food to be prepped over there (? What). I get back to my desk to find, sauce on the sammie, not on the side.   No biggie, I'll deal.  The meat was too greasy for my liking, with fat blobs that I'm sure some people love but not me.  The sauce I though would be hot was so very mild (not a bad thing in my book).   I had, had their porchetta before and that was super yummie the first go, the second go wasn't as good. So 3 stars for Coco and the Director."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check this coffee shop out based on raves and reviews my friends had shared. I'll start with the positives; the interior has a rustic farmhouse vibe and has an array of seating options that are really cool. There's no shortage in decor and witty sayings to keep your eyes amused. I ordered an iced cold brew coffee and my husband ordered a hot chocolate. As a coffee snob and self proclaimed expert, the brew was decent. Hot chocolate is hard to mess up, so my husband was satisfied. I would return for the coffee if I were in the area.  The negatives; our customer service was not the best. Our barista that checked us out seemed less than impressed with us and annoyed by my questions as a first timer. We also ordered two breakfast sandwiches which would've been delicious except they were cold. Not what we were looking forward to!   I wouldn't make a special trip to return here, but it was neat to check out."}
{"text":"well that was easy to rate. thanks for serving me the best coffee i've had in charlotte to date. (i have been to over 20 different businesses for coffee in town). i had a latte and my friend had a flat white. both were the best we've had in charlotte. i also had an almond croissant that was really good and went well with the latte.  the atmosphere is better than any other coffee shops. i guess i could be more detailed but it's been explained well in other reviews already."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee spots in town.Once you get past the cool/funky/hip/different layout and decor, it's actually a great space for coffee and even getting work done. God bless you if you can sit comfortably on the cushions spread out on the chairs, but I prefer the tables upstairs. I feel like the tables by the window left me a little slouched over trying to do work, but are great for conversation. Connected to the beautifully redone Marriott, it is located right in the heart of Uptown.   Staff has always been really friendly and rumor has it the macaroons are vegan and delicious."}
{"text":"I go to Coco quite often on my way into work. There is often a line of a few people but it moves pretty quickly. The decor is very modern and interesting. There's an upstairs lounge and they even serve beer in the cold case if you want to grab a drink in the afternoon.   I usually just get a drip coffee so I can't speak to their espresso drinks. The coffee is pretty good though not gourmet. I prefer it over Starbucks and many other chains in the area.  Their breakfast sandwiches are quite good. The one healthier option - the chicken sausage and egg bagel - is kind of hard to eat though. The sausage casing causes the links to pull completely out of the sandwich on the first bite. Kind of silly to point out but I don't get this one anymore because it won't stay together.   I've gotten a chicken Cesar salad before and it was decent, though not worth the price. For a coffee, yogurt, and salad I think my total came to $21.   I like the place but it's not my favorite. Definitely a convenient and decent choice around Trade and Tryon though."}
{"text":"What a nice and clean store! So many local products in one place. They sell Boone Barrs which they have stopped selling at local markets around Charlotte. They have a wide variety of coffee brewing methods. Not to mention, the whole place was clean and oh so cozy! They have pillows and seat cushions and this is a great place to work on your laptop, meet and chat with friends. They also sell food here too! Fairly priced espresso beverages, I had the iced mocha and it was absolutely perfect. Will visit again when I'm uptown."}
{"text":"Finally I have made it to Coco and the Director! I am just in love with the atmosphere, décor and feel in Coco and the Director. I came for lunch to get the sandwich of the day, which is posted on their Twitter page everyday. It was a Friday so its usually Fried Chicken Friday and the sandwich was good BUT it is a huge piece of chicken! I could only eat half of my sandwich. But what stole the show for me was the desserts! My first time having a cronut!!!! AMAZING!!! Do yourself a favor and get the pecan pie cronut, its my favorite, maybe I'm bias because its the only on I've had though lol. I have heard the maple bacon is great as well! I also tried the almond croissant, really really good! There was so much I wanted to try but my diet would not allow lol. I cant wait to come back and get cozy on a weekend or evening to do work or read in the stadium seating. Or attend an Adult coloring and wine night :) I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. The atmosphere is just productive and comfortable. Study, work, read, or just hangout. There is wifi and outlets available everywhere. Open up space and lots natural lighting.  Drink options would put 1.5 dollar signs but delicious. It is in uptown connected to the Marriot so free parking is very difficult to get or find. Due to this I put four stars. If there was parking for Coco's customers within the Marriot or around there that would be great and would put five stars. Either walking or getting dropped off would save the parking hassle. Overall awesome."}
{"text":"Best space I've seen in Charlotte that marries community, collaboration, entrepreneurial spirit, support of local coffee teas & food that I've experienced in CLT.   If you are looking for a great coffee or tea or simply in need of an easy cafe type bite while working in an open and energetically aligned space come here.   I had the Turkey BLT which was good & a Dirty Chai that's spot on!   No cons...."}
{"text":"Very cool concept...absorb the atmosphere for real though. The seating...the signs...I have travelled a hell of a lot and I never seen a coffee shop like this. They have auditorium like seating like you were in an outdoor theater, hilarious signs, random snacks/creations to stir your brains and the coffee is strong as it should be! Stop by...I would again!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place!!! If you get a chance check this place out.  At first I thought it was going to be too hipster for me, but I was pleasantly surprised. First off I wish I could remember the girls name behind the counter but she was amazing! Funny and sweet, she gave my friends and I the run down on the place. Like how they host yoga there and also a movie night. They have a section for coffee and baked goods, they also have a bar area and food. I mean what more could you ask for. Oh yeah everything is for sale,they have the cutest little trinkets that you can find. It reminds me of things found on Etsy.   I had a cronut. It was cinnamon sugar and probably one of the best experiences my tastebuds have had. I'm in love, and I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The decor and overall aesthetic of this place is very impressive...  I think it's a great idea and should be a great study spot for those looking for that.  I had the mocha and though I would choose this over Starbucks, it has competition in the vicinity that produce a superior product.  I would recommend trying it if you're not that concerned with getting the very best.  I think many will find this place attractive that features coffee that gets the job done."}
{"text":"This is the coffee shop we didn't even know we needed. A coworker and I walked over this morning, and I'm already trying to figure out how to move in my office so I can just work here full-time.  We got there around 9 a.m., and the place was pretty empty. Or maybe there were a ton of people there, but it's just so huge with a million different seating options that we didn't notice? Regardless, it was nice to be in a coffee shop and have plenty of room to breathe and sprawl - there's a bar along the window, massive stairs with comfy-looking pillows heading to an upstairs area, and tables and cozy chairs around the back. It pretty well takes up the entire space that Savannah Red used to.  My coworker and I were boring and got 16 oz coffees, and it cost $3.75 total - wha?!? A large coffee was only $1.50! And it was GOOD.   We didn't have much time to look around, but we noticed all kinds of snacks, sandwiches, sweets, and of course, drinks. There's a loyalty card, and you get a free drink after 10 purchases, which shouldn't take me too long to knock out.  I feel like I need to walk a fine line of telling everyone how awesome C&TD is so they stay in business but not telling so many people that I have to wait in line. But go there. Seriously."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place, it's my new favorite. They also carry the best peaches I've found. The lattes need some work though, I definitely judge a coffee shop by how good the mochas are and I didn't like their mocha much. The only drink I really enjoy is the caramel iced latte. Other than this problem it's a beautiful spot to hang out or work in."}
{"text":"Stop putting pink paint marker on the cups... it rubs off and gets all over my hands and clothes"}
{"text":"This place was much bigger than I realized! Great space for working or chatting. Love the decor and knick knacks to look at while you're waiting for your drink. I had an americano which wasn't bad, and a sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich which I wouldn't recommend. The sausage was very small, and it was pretty flavorless."}
{"text":"This is a unique coffee shop. I had the dirty chai tea without the dirty. Lol. Found out it was a double shot of expresso and although I needed to be awake I chose not to. The blue berry muffin was excellent. They also have sandwiches."}
{"text":"Such a great place to work! Really cool lay out with a busy, open area and a quieter more secluded work area in the back. I had a delicious dirty chai latte and once we were done with our work we went to the larger area to play board games. I wish I lived in Charlotte because I would be here every day I could."}
{"text":"Was stopped on the street this week and given a pass into the sneak peak this Wednesday, and it was quite a treat! The interior is phenomenal, I cannot wait to cozy up and hang out in this place. The set up is what Charlotte didn't know they needed. I ordered some cold brew and you could tell it was top-notch. This place boasts organic, local drinks/foods and they even have a cute gift shop, pastries, sandwiches, desserts, and much more. They also have wine and beer! I cannot wait to be an regular here, the staff was amazingly friendly and inviting. You can tell they really believe in the vision. Also can't wait to check out the Stoke bar and restaurant, really exciting things are happening in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This quaint coffee shop located in the Marriot Hotel is going to be one of my new favorite spots to visit. The design is misleading-there is a lot of space in there! Plenty of cushions to get comfortable on the stairs, and loft area that you'll miss if you aren't paying attention. The staff are friendly and prompt. The stock is greatly varied, lots of sweets and savories to choose from. I haven't had a chance to try the coffee, but the hot peach tea is exceptional . The music is also nice, not too loud. Great place to read, study, hangout, chat, etc."}
{"text":"Love it. So different from your average cafe. Great spaces to work. Plenty of seating. And TVs for Sunday football work day. Great cappuccino."}
{"text":"Hipster central. Lots of plugs. Big screen projector screen. Cute shopping section with different food options."}
{"text":"Such a neat place! Apparently they have movie nights here too so I'll have to check that out. Service was a little slow but not horrible and they were very nice. The coffee was good but the main draw is the layout of this place. So cozy and interesting. Could have stayed in there for hours. They also have a lot of interesting little knick knacks for sale."}
{"text":"Wow! This place just oozes sexy. The tiered, giant step like seating is creative genius. Modern without feeling too stark. Part deli/part coffee shop offering gourmet sandwiches, pastries, locally roasted coffees and even a gift shop. How cool is that? Pretty damn cool. I want to live here.  Communicates with the lobby of the Marriot City Center. Great pre or post dinner/event stop!"}
{"text":"My new favorite coffee shop! Love the vibe! I decided to stop in here on my way back from breakfast to grab an iced coffee. I was really surprised in how cute this place is. I was expecting it to look like your stereotypical Starbucks as it's connected to a hotel but it was the furthest thing from that.   The inside looks like an old coffee shop that you'd expect to see in a place like NYC. There's also unique local gifts to purchase along the side of the store which i enjoyed looking at waiting for my coffee. The seating was my favorite thing about the place. I'll include a picture as it's hard to explain, but basically it's multiple levels with cushions.   I ended up getting cold brew coffee that was great! Can't wait to come back and try some other drinks off the menu. This was definitely a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Walking by this beauty and had to do a double take!  Atmosphere- The stadium seating is what caught my eye and drew me into the shop! Overall, this place embodies trendy coffee shop. It boasts a huge are of industrial modern decor! They have cute things for sale aside from food and coffee, and also a great selection of cold bottled drinks lining their walls.  Staff- Fun and friendly! I loved the charismatic people I encountered! Nothing makes an area less relaxing than unfriendly staff, so I was happy to see sweet smiles!  Coffee- I drink a lot of coffee, like a lot! This place had some good stuff! My boyfriend ordered a caramel latte and loved it! I ordered a dirty chai and it was pretty good, not the most flavorful chai but hey their espresso was good! I also noticed they sell a local tea company tea which I thought was a cool touch!  Overall, a must for coffee lovers (and not, I mean they have tea and yummy looking sandwiches)! Also just a great place to go and hang out! I got a lot of work done and was reluctant to leave!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of better coffee shops in Charlotte.  The guy who took my order wasn't very friendly. I got a latte with the cinnamon sugar syrup, and it barely tastes like cinnamon. And was just warm not hot, I had to put it in the microwave. I also got a muffin, which the guy who took my order forgot to give to me and wasn't happy when I asked for it, he just kind of threw it in the bag.  Overall, I decided to give this place a second chance, but I will not be going back for a third time."}
{"text":"Hip, cozy, and quiet.  Located in Uptown Charlotte, Coco and the Director is the perfect place to settle in with a good book and sip on their smooth pour-over coffee.  - They have a wide assortment of pastries, but their Cinnamon Cronut immediately caught my eye! This croissant/ doughnut crossover was flaky like a croissant , but fried with a creamy filling like a doughnut  - perfect in every way."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried it for the first time this morning and I am amazed at how good it is. Had a latte (extra shot) and an almond croissant. Yummy :) The atmosphere pretty relaxed, plenty of seating. And can't forget the retail items, a great selection of items you wouldn't normally find anywhere else. Overall I think I just found my new coffee shop and it is in the heart of Uptown."}
{"text":"This is the cutest coffee shop in Charlotte!! The staff is uber friendly. The food is great and so are the drinks. They have the pastries delivered fresh from a local Frenchmen every morning... Delicious!!   Unlike many other shops, there is such a wide variety of seating options. There is a wide set of stairs in the front of the store adorned with bean bags and pillows for all to cozy up (Side Note: this would be a perfect location to sit and watch one of the infamous Charlotte summer time storms). They have a small meeting room area in the back that you can reserve to get some work done. And of course they have the traditional tables and chairs upstairs.   They also have a small shopping area with cute trinkets. The assortment includes perfumes, teas, greeting cards, and unique household items like plates and coasters.  To quote some of my sorority sisters, this place is \"TOTS ADORBZ\" (pronounced: toats a-door-bz meaning: totally adorable)"}
{"text":"Eating the sandwich of the day as we speak. First of all it's BIG. Second of all everything from the bread on the top to the bread on the bottom tasted fresh and had a lot of flavor. Congrats on your opening and welcome to Charlotte! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have been stalking the kronuts at this place for a while.  Seeing the sugarmans Instagram posts tagging coco's case of kronuts, they look so incredible.  For the uninitiated, a kronut is a cross between a doughnut and a croissant.  It has so many layers, fried crispy on the outside and chewy goodness on the inside.  My wife got a coffee version with icing on the top.  I got the pecan pie version.  Both were just incredibly good, right out of the case at room temp.  We visited on a Saturday, being that this is in the lobby of the uptown Mariot, we have heard it gets crazy crowded during the week.  We have not had the pleasure of visiting then, but on this Saturday, it was quiet and calm.  Perfect for enjoying a latte and kronut in the shadows of the skyscrapers of uptown Charlotte.  I really enjoyed the different spaces this place offers.  My latte was solid, nothing spectacular.  Come here for a kronut and a Center city feel."}
{"text":"a cozy place to hang out (and play guess who, or do homework if you actually try to be the studious type of college kid). i loved this place before but love it even more because one of the baristas is always so friendly and makes the best surprise drinks when i'm indecisive and not sure what to get!!"}
{"text":"4 Stars for the decor and the location. They did a nice job trying to remove themselves from the Marriot - I would've never thought this would be the type of coffee shop connected to a Marriot - it's funky, cool, very trendy.   3 stars for the service, I was confused and asked a question to who was at the register about their sizes ( low and behold they only have one) but my question was almost met with an eye roll and I felt embarrassed after for asking it, I felt a little dumb, and I think the register worker thought the same. HOWEVER, the gentleman making my coffee, and the one who handed it to me were both very sweet and made me forget about the first worker.   1.5 stars for the coffee, though not \"pricey\" per se, I felt ripped off for what I got. The one size fits all was tiny, and I was running low on fuel, I needed caffeine to give me it's helping hand :( and the child size did not do it for me. On top of that, the coffee was not good, I sipped on it for a moment and threw it out. Had to stop by elsewhere to get my fix.   Cute spot to hang out in, decent service (for the most part), not good coffee. Solid 2.5 stars overall."}
{"text":"Hello Coco, Hello the Director. It's nice to finally meet you.   I was introduced to what's now my favorite , Coco and the Director, few weeks after I moved to Charlotte. My friend knows my addiction to good coffee, and she promised me of a strong and good coffee. I was seduced, I was weak, and I kept coming back.   This café deserve your attention, here's why: - Yummy baked bites to eat. Look for the week's Sandwiches lineup announcement on social media.  - Handpicked artisan crafts and locally sourced gourmet assortment. - Free WiFi and plug-and-play tables. - Don't miss Wine & Color Wednesday. Color and unwind with $5 wine glasses and half priced pastries.    Five Yelps."}
{"text":"This is a great space to have a cup of chai tea and work. Love the decor of the place. I went to have a business meeting. I did get a chai tea to drink. Staff was great. They pretty much have all the options you get a Starbucks, but also offer local drinks. If the juice drinks they have you covered with Green Brothers juice. Really not a downside to this place. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"bright modern and cheery place. lots of modern seating on the main floor and a decent amount upstairs as well. a couple of nooks if you don't feel like gawking at the street or the patrons inside the place. several shelves of retail stuff like soaps and lotions and conversation piece housewares. thought it was a little odd, but for some reason it also works. modern piped in music that was not overly loud.   took a a few seconds to get the staff to warm up, but once they did they were friendly and accommodating. choice of 4 different beans for the pour-over. Forte Legato is their roaster.  went with the Sulawesi Toraja. it was decent.   pastry selection was a little scant and overpriced. they had a couple varieties of cronuts. none of which looked good enough to pay $6 for. went with a chocolate chip muffin. a staff member told me that the Marriott (which they are attached to) provides them. it was as good as expected. at least it was priced decently at $3.   like i said, the place is attached to the Marriott so you have to go into that portion of the building to use the gender specific bathrooms. they were fancy and clean and most were booth style where there was a nice door on them that went from ceiling to floor. love that! very cool modern music piped into it too!   good place to come back to!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Charlotte for our anniversary and stopped by Coco on a Sunday morning. Not only were we impressed with the overall vibe, decor and layout, but the employees were friendly and even a bit quirky (in a good way). We had to get going, but I could have seen us spending a couple hours there, just lounging and enjoying the ambience."}
{"text":"I'm pretty impressed with Coco and what I've seen so far.  Probably the most impactful thing they have going for them is their space.  Located right at the HEART of Charlotte, TRADE & TRYON, we are talking about prime real estate here.  I'm not sure where you would go to park, but I'm a big fan of walking around everywhere.... make a trip out of it and use the light rail, or park at your usual go-to parking deck, and stroll out uptown.  If you enter in from the street, you notice a large lounge and stairs with lots of cushions on it for laying down and relaxing.  Turn around and they've got a projector playing on the wall - great for movie night events (I think there is one coming up).  You can just relax, have your treats and work/watch tv/read...  I like the concept.  Probably the only downside is when people decided to get \"too comfortable\" here and probably aren't wearing the best clothing for said laying around.  Makes for some good people watching though!  The baristas? (I don't know what they call them here) have all been super nice and they always start a conversation with you more than the robotic, \"can I take your order\" at other places.  They know their menu too!  I've had a couple of questions - like what makes a \"dirty chai\" \"dirty\"... and they were very accommodating and knowledgeable.  Along the right side are lots of trinkets and eccentric goods you can shop (good gifts) or inspiring artwork to look at.  And if you continue on to the right, the Marriott Lobby is connected to this place along with Stoke.  There's a large table in the back and also one in front of the place for group meetings and collaborations... and with the 2nd level up top... there should be no problem finding a seat / space here - very versatile."}
{"text":"This cafe has a great, chill environment that lures you to stay around all day whether you want coffee, tea, wine, beer, cider, etc. you can either relax with friends or get some work done.   They have regular wine tastings on Thursdays, and sometimes have live music.   As a tea enthusiast, I am satisfied with their tea. Currently drinking their ice green tea and it's perfectly brewed.   The cafe also has a book sharing shelf which is great if you're looking for something to entertain you while you're here.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is out of the way for me, with that being said I would totally go back here for the ambience, coffee, house made syrups, atmosphere and just to hang out with friends. What a great place to enjoy a good read, company, date or to just chill. I have one request, can you open one closer to south charlotte????"}
{"text":"My first time visiting Coco and the Director was on a Friday night. I was disappointed to see so few people there because I really think this could be a huge competitor to Amelie's in uptown. My fiancée and I were looking for a place that served alcohol and coffee in a coffee shop setting. We tried out Coco and the Director and were not disappointed!   They have this crazy unique stadium seating facing a projector. The staff mentioned to us that they plan to show Panthers games on a big screen. Also, they said that you could buy any beer or wine at Stoke and bring it over.   We'll be back to Coco. The ONLY downside is that you have to pay for parking but there is an LAZ lot that is $5 after hours nearby on Church St.  Overall, would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love hitting up to new coffee shops, and I stumble across this place. I first saw this place on Instagram and was hoping one day I could try out this place. Although, they don't have much selection with coffee flavors, I tried their Caramel Latte and it wasn't too bad. I'm also huge tea fanatic and I had to try their Governors Grey from the Charleston Plantation and it was good. I typically put honey in my tea and I'm impress their honey was good too. (I'm really picky with my honey. Real honey over fake honey) This place has a modern look, but homey feeling. Compare with the coffee shops I've tried in Uptown, this would be my favorite. I haven't tried their food yet, but I'll save that for the next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Very good coffee (and I am a coffee snob) - fantastic breakfast sandwiches and pastries."}
{"text":"Looking for a cool spot to hang out with friends, grab coffee on a date or work? This place is it! It's located next to the Marriott uptown. They have seating for everyone from cushions on a stair step to small and large collaborative tables.  They have a nice assortment of pastries and breakfast sandwiches at a reasonable price. I opted for the banana bread. For $2, I got a generous piece! If you're a cold brew fan, it's delicious especially on a hot day.  If you're not a coffee drinker, they have tons of bottled water, tea, juice and Kombucha.   There are board games and books for you to enjoy. There are also small local items you can purchase like candles and other Knick knacks."}
{"text":"Coco and the Director has a great vibe. Definitely NOT your run-of-the-mill hotel coffee spot. Simple drink selection. Americano on point. Not a huge fan of their Costa Rican house coffee, though. A good place to meet friends or just chill out by yourself on the platform of cushions or in the loft!"}
{"text":"Great spot next to/in the Marriott that's open relatively late!  Only popped in with my friend really quickly to grab a coffee - solid regular drip, good flavor. My friend got a pour over filter drip, he enjoyed it. Friendly and helpful service, will be back whenever I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I came here after dinner with some friends. The whole setting is beautiful and interesting. There are tables to sit at as well as pillows on stairs. The service was good and the whole restaurant was clean. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit this place since I moved to CLT. Today was that day! I say \"Yes!\" to this place. I would recommend this place and I'm coming back with the cavalry!!"}
{"text":"Love Coco for meetings and co working. The atmosphere and decor is unlike any other place I have seen. I usually order a latte and a Nutella croissant. The croissants are so good I usually scarf it down while waiting for my latte to be handed to me. I would come back for the croissant alone!"}
{"text":"Easily my new favorite place to get coffee and relax. It's perfect to get work done as well. Told the employee it was my first time and gave me a free coffee and a great recommendation. Maple Latte was perfect. If you're a CPCC student and you need to study, I highly recommend taking the short trolly ride."}
{"text":"This is really incomplete as the espresso machine was down at the time I had my coffee meeting. I didn't want to move the meeting upon finding that while walking in so just had a nice brewed coffee and my guest a tea. The coffee was great and didn't need any sweetener for me. I love the layout of the place and the co-working areas. The steps looked like a fun place to hang out and do a little people watching. I look forward to coming back and trying some other drinks and I am sure this will be a 4 or 5 next time."}
{"text":"The cinnamon & brown sugar latte is the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. It is pure heaven in a cup. The baristas were very friendly and gave me great recommendations. Love it!"}
{"text":"Cutest coffee place... it's attached to the Marriott hotel so unless your staying at the hotel or work downtown parking sometimes is hard but it's totally worth the hassle.I usually get the regular coffee with almond milk with the cinnamon brown sugar syrup which is to die for. The cronuts are amazing any flavor that you get you wouldn't be disappointed with your decision.  The CoCo and the Director has the cutest environment. It has a good play on with modern and hipster vibe. Whether a coffee junkie or not it's a must try."}
{"text":"Soooooo cute!! Came here for coffee with the Hubs on Sunday.  Love love love.  Got a flat white and a reg latte and both were really really good!   I love that you can order ahead using the Cloosiv app!! Score!!  Such a great space to grab a spot towards the back during non-peak times to either get work done or read.  They sell beer and wine in a can and also Rosé Hard Cider?!? Hee hee!   Lurve it."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with some friends one evening.  I didn't have anything so this review is based off the environment and the atmosphere.  It is a nice rustic feel throughout.  The shop is cozy, well decorated, and clean.  The staff was helpful in giving my friend directions, explaining the menu, and giving menu descriptions as well.    I didn't really see a lot of pastries that looked good, but perhaps it rotates.  I would definitely come in and try the coffee sometime.  Just my quick visit kept me intrigued."}
{"text":"My visit to Coco and the Director yesterday afternoon was brief, but I do hope to get back at some point during my quick Charlotte visit, because this place is awesome! I was struck by the cool decor, and the grocery-style set-up of beverages and snacks when you first walk in. The seating areas looked really fun and the perfect place for a meeting or solo work sesh.   I ordered a cold brew, and it was absolutely delicious. The coffee had a rich, chocolatey taste that I loved. Also, the young woman working behind the counter was very nice.   Don't be turned off by the location (it's in a Marriott). This is a local biz one should not miss!"}
{"text":"I love the design, layout and retail offerings in Coco and the Director. The two stars are purely for their Cold Brew - which is anything but. I drink my coffee black with a little sweetener, today I asked for caramel. \"Cold Brew w/ Caramel please\" What I received literally looked like iced tea and tasted like water. I was with a co-worker who had the same but with cream. He took a couple of sips and threw the rest in the trash.   Skip the cold brew, try something hot and enjoy the decor."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this cafe. The ambience is great, very cozy and relaxed however it is extremely over priced. $22 dollars for a Caesar salad and two iced coffees is a little high. The selection is great but if I return I will only be ordering coffee."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere! Delicious coffee, cold brew, and house syrups! The seating is plentiful and comfy. The flat white was one of the best ice ever had and the latte was perfectly made. The service at the bar was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had the coffee both times. I would described it in two words as STRONG and GOOD. I think their prices are kinda steep ($6 for a large iced coffee with almond milk) so I wouldn't come here often but it is pretty good.   The last time I went here with a friend, he ordered the Cobb Salad. He said it was tasty. The people around us got their sandwiches and they looked good. Huge drink selection in the cooler, as well.   What makes this spot extra awesome is the decor. It is exquisitely decorated. There is a ton of seating and PLENTY of outlets (my #1 request of a coffee shop)."}
{"text":"Delicous baked goods.  Delicious coffee.  Awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"The staff here is very friendly. I like the atmosphere. Cool place to drink coffee and hang for a bit."}
{"text":"This place is great, especially for a relaxing lunch!   The vibe is very relaxing and open. There's an adorable lounge area with what I call \"gaming chairs\" where you can lay back and surf the Internet on your laptop if you bring one. There's another side of the place with a TV and lounge chairs, one area with a wide desk, and another area upstairs with seating where you can easily eat lunch!   I had the chicken Caesar salad, and it was amazing! I was apprehensive because it was a bit pricey ($13 I believe), but it was a decent size, and the chicken was GREAT quality!!   I also got a bottled Michelin Ultra (I was SO happy they had my favorite beer here) and an iced cappuccino. I normally don't like coffee that's not from Starbucks, but this drink is great!  On top of all this, the location is incredibly convenient. I happened upon this place as I was starving and looking for a different restaurant. What a great detour!  I will definitely be back next time im in Charlotte. (:"}
{"text":"Definitely the best coffee shop in town.. and probably one of the best I've ever been to! what a cool layout! There's space to sit and chit chat, there's space to lounge, there's space to sit and get work done, and there's a reserve-able space if you need a quiet area to work, or think, or just be! Did I mention there's also a little space upstairs for kiddos?  Bright, clean, lively ambiance.  Courteous and friendly staff  Good coffee Decent breakfast/food options (though, a little pricey) Great location They've got everything they need, to be a 5-star cafe in my books! :) I'm enjoying the fact that they don't get ridiculously busy right now because they're still relatively new, but I have no doubt that that's going to change very quickly once word gets out!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to hang out. I would always come here before work for my morning coffee and get a tea after work and just hang out until it gets dark. The ambiance is wonderful (the staggered stair seating is delightful), the place is clean, and they are constantly changing their menu to appease their customers.  Overall a great place to hang out or to meet someone. I also love that it's attached to the Hilton hotel! Word on the street is that Coco and the Director is the Hilton's beta test location for their chain of coffee shops. Although there aren't many people that pass through the shops, I am constantly rooting for them to pick up a customer base!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute, it has me dying to come back for another visit.   Coco and the Director is such a fun place. Someone recommended it as a place to take our engagement photos (we wound up shooting them somewhere else), we had to take a peek at the location and, of course, try their coffee.   I am so impressed with the aesthetics of this place. I was a little disappointed walking up seeing that it's in the bottom of a hotel, BUT beyond you'd have NO idea once you're inside. Coco and the Director does a great job of product placement and leaving art littered throughout the shop so you can maybe instagramable photos.   Coffee was on point. I ordered an iced mocha with almond milk. Note, non-dairy options are soy and almond, no coconut milk. I also ordered a dip hot coffee. I wanted a dark roast, but they were roasting a medium that day. The coffee was incredibly hot and the sleeve didn't help with the heat. Beyond my coffee being \"too\" hot and not offering a dark roast, I am so tickled that Coco and the Director is in my backyard. I can't wait to come back and see this team again!"}
{"text":"This place is the best hidden coffee shop! Stumbled upon it on accident, but I'm glad I did! Got a latte, and wanted syrup added, and the lady working the register at the time suggested caramel and bourbon syrup, oh man, am I glad I took her suggestion! It was amazing! The place is very unique and awesome to go chill at. They have tons of games that you can play while in the sitting area. Awesome find in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"New favorite place to work from! There are a ton of outlets, the wifi works great, coffee is reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is like no other in CLT!"}
{"text":"Charlotte is now home to a few coffeeshops with grassroots character.  I don't know that I'd call C&D grassroots, since it's heavily tied to the Marriott, but they show promise for sure.  I certainly keep them in play on my coffeehouse rotation.  The biggest thing going for them is their location.  You can't really beat the exposure offered from the Trade and Tryon intersection, and the space is massive for a coffeeshop.  They made great use of natural light via floor to ceiling storefront windows.  There is a second, loft-style, level with overlook seating, and of course, the infamous \"stadium seating.\"  The stadium seating is nothing more than stair stepped bench levels that offer a grand seating area with various coffeehouse-esk pillows and cushions strewn about.  Works for me.  The menu is limited and offers no blended type beverages, so if you're looking for a frappuccino, step on around the corner to the nearby buck stop.  They do offer some deli style sandwiches and such in their readymade cooler.  In addition you'll find quirky snacks and a variety of bottled beverages.    There is a book swapping station.  Take one, leave one if you will.  There are also a few giftable items for purchase.  If you wander around the corner towards the back of the bar area, there are larger tables for sharing that are a bit more private.  Up front there's one large community table beneath the large, suspended projection television.    I don't think the coffee is the greatest in the world, but it's not horrible either.  They offer a frequent punch card, and it's a great mobile working spot.  The Wi-Fi is one and the same as that of the Marriott, but it is free.  The backside of the space opens up directly into the Marriott lobby, and is the only outlet to a restroom, as the space does not have its own designated bathroom.  Each time I've visited, I've seen more and more people taking advantage of the space.  It's definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The space alone is worth a review. It's so different from other coffee shops in the area--especially the uptown area. For starters, you don't feel cramped. There are regular tables set out and then a HUGE area to lounge and study or catch up with a friend, pillows for comfort included. You can also rent a space in the back for meetings which is pretty nice.    I loved all the cute little gifts they had available for purchase, if you're in a bind for a quick present--this is the place to drop by.   Pricing was fine and the cold brew was great. Service was friendly and attentive, I would absolutely recommend it and can't wait to go back and try a kronut!"}
{"text":"Coco and the director was such a cool coffee shop. My husband ordered a traditional coffee and I had a tea which I asked the barista to recommend and she did but I didn't like it much! The atmosphere is so nice and the price is good + the staff is pleasant. They have a huge sitting area for lounging or you can walk upstairs for a more tradition coffee shop setting with chairs and tables. I love how the coffee shop is true to charlotte with the painting of local artist etc they also offered snacks other little bites. we were lucky on our visit and got meet a celebrity poodle (he was adorable) can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"This is a cute coffee shop that I've frequented a couple of times to do my work in. I haven't tried any of their coffee yet but the ambiance is dope. When I walked in I definitely didn't expect the layout concept that they designed...  They have a pseudo-bleacher type of structure in the lounge where there are pillows on the floor and you can chill and do your work, watch some tv or just kick back and drink your coffee. There are also numerous chairs and tables upstairs while  the lower level has stools and chairs by the windows. It's a really great use of space. The coffee shop used to be a sports bar, so it's cool to see how much they achieved with the space they were given.  I'll update my review once I've actually tried the coffee."}
{"text":"this place had great coffee, a smooth atmosphere that encourages both productivity and leisure sipping. The staff is super helpful in suggesting what to get. But. Ring in the core of uptown, parking is not convenient. Unless you will be in uptown all day and have paid for a deck you're going to drop a pretty penny."}
{"text":"Me and my friend were so excited to go and try this place but the person who took our order was extremely rude. We were taking time to decide what we wanted and this lady literally says to try and hurry up cuz it's just coffee. We also tried a dessert but it wasn't even worth it. It's a great place to go and study but please improve on customer service."}
{"text":"Yes, please!!   Yes, to the ENTIRE AMBIANCE of this place! I parked on 5th street and walked here because it's in the space that used to be Champs (I believe that's the name) attached to the Marriott. Every corner of this place will pique your interest and spark your curiosity.   Also, many of the items, if not all, that line the shelves are available for purchase. Men, they also have beer, beard oil AND all three televisions were showing ESPN or football... you're welcome!   Needless to say, I will be returning to relax with my laptop and another one of their yummy lattes."}
