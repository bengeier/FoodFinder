{"text":"Wonderful. Food that is uncompromisingly delicious Eliot Wexler has done it again.  Watch out tempe. There is a new restaurant in town and it is amazing.  You must go before the lines start forming.  Great experience"}
{"text":"Great food and service   Jeff was amazing!! Best airport restaurant  quick corrects service. I hear they are opening one in tempe. Bon appetit."}
{"text":"Horrible service. No one in line for obvious reasons. Waited while a male employee makes contact with me maybe 3 times, doesn't even say hi, I keep waiting.. Female employee comes out yay there's a cashier, oh wait no she has to fill the drinks up front in the cooler before helping Anyone.. So I wait. She says \"you want something\" I reply \"yeah, I'd like to order?\" She doesn't respond just continues filling drinks... Oh good she's done, takes my order and makes me repeat it 3 times since she couldn't hear. I see now why there again was no line! Get it together if you want ppl stopping by. All other food spots near were packed lol. Sad for them."}
{"text":"Heard some good news through the grapevine so thought I would check it out. Breakfast burrito was amazing! Service was great. Everyone loved their brunch. Definitely going to become a regular"}
{"text":"They don't use real cheese. It's called \"Chedda\" on the menu. When I asked what \"chedda\" was the woman behind the register looked very confused. I showed her the spelling on the menu and she assured me that they use real cheese and that the spelling must be a mistake. So I ordered a breakfast bagel. And it was not real cheese. It was some sort of creepy cheese like substitute. It looked like cheddar but did not taste like it."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain but in this case I feel compelled to advise others not to spend the outrageous price for the Sir Charles Roast Beef hoagie.  The sandwich meat was bland tasting and tough and the bread soggy. Was possibly the worst hoagie I've begun to eat. Could not get the second bite down.  Honestly, I do not like to write poor reviews, but, save your ten bucks for the next sandwich vendor."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service on the sandwich side. Avoid if you're even a little worried about time. I sure hope the food is good."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast there. Ordered caprese sandwich ( cheese + veggies) . Delicious and light on the stomach.   Location is alright, near ASU. Parking on the street, maybe two dollars/hour. Seatings are good and patio seatings are available. Not so great for a group of 4 and above. Staff are friendly .   Overall good place to try out."}
{"text":"I loved this place, I got the Meyer Lanksy with their triple cooked fries. It's a very flavorful, rich sandwich. All of the flavors and textures came together in a really wonderful way. Make sure to order it with gruyere, it's extra but it's worth it! The fries come with a really nice aioli, which I always prefer to ketchup. They also have a really subtle, earthy iced tea that I enjoyed. The only thing that could use some work is the presentation, the trays with wax paper feels a little cheap for the price point, but I will keep coming back if the quality of the food stays the same!"}
{"text":"It was delicious. I ordered the Caprese sandwich. I just wish they served breakfast all day, especially since they are only open until 2:30."}
{"text":"I ordered a cherry and oatmeal cookie here.   It was more like a mega cookie.   It was soft but cooked through with really good flavor.   The girls working inside were really friendly too.  It was cool they used an iPad to check out instead of an old fashioned register."}
{"text":"I heard about the hype from this place from friends who had visited previously. I work at ASU and thought I'd pop in for a quick bite.  I arrived about 10am and the place was empty. I didn't think much of it, since it's mainly a lunch spot. Upon arrival it looked like the staff was still setting up the menu which I found a bit off since it opens at 8am. I wasn't greeted by anyone, but didn't think much of it since everyone seemed preoccupied. After perusing the menu, I decided on the pastrami and egg sandwich since it seemed to be reasonably priced at $7.75. What I received was not worth the value. I asked for mine on an egg bagel, which came out hard as a rock. The filling was not much better. The eggs were overcooked and the pastrami was partially burned. The cream cheese was almost non-existent. I would have said something, but I got my order to go, and had already walked back to my office.  As for the service, it was very underwhelming. The only real thing that I heard beyond what would you like, was a cheery goodbye on the way out. They had about 3-4 people in the kitchen which would lead you to believe that they would provide prompt service. My eggs sandwich took about 15 minutes with nobody's order in front of mine. I can see why my food was overcooked. The staff seemed like they were having a good old time. Someone whom I believed to be a manager or owner was sitting at the bar working away without saying a word to staff when my food sat in the window for a couple more minutes before making it into my hands.  The location is in a fantastic spot and it seems to have been renovated nicely. I didn't get the vibe that too many people were actually able to enjoy themselves in this space, since it was unclear to me how you should place your order or where would be a good spot to sit. There was a bum camped outside the front doors who asked me for a change a second time on my way out even after I told him no the first time. Could be a great spot with better focus.  The music was way too loud for 10am. It felt like I was in a club."}
{"text":"They have high aspirations but fall shy. Two of us had lunch. She had the \"What the cluck?\", I had the \"Meyer Lansky\" (Wagyu pastrami, etc.) and we had the \"Thrice cooked fries\" for a side. Once you stop with the teenage giggling over the clever (not) name of the chicken sandwich, it was the best thing served. The pastrami sandwich might have been good if there had been enough pastrami on it to even have a taste. Two paper thin slices of meat, a wad of Cole slaw to kill the flavor and enough rye bread to be sure to bury whatever flavor was left. As for thrice cooked fries, they should have stopped at twice. Overcooked, hard, dry. Plus a really weird seasoning."}
{"text":"Fast, healthy food! Went there for lunch with the kids and they loved their sandwiches, so did I. Very fresh, good food. French fries were amazing. Desserts are delectable and paired great with the espresso."}
{"text":"So far I like it! A few vegetarian options here! Very happy with the caprese sandwich! It feels a little tight inside with not a ton of places to sit or wait for Togo orders. However,  food was ready quick and super fresh! Will be back soon. :)"}
{"text":"Terrible. $10.50 for a worse than fast food style burger with no side. Entire terminal 4, C gates needs a revamp on employee training"}
{"text":"Let's have a serious talk about airport food.    Let me start by saying--Nocawich is NOT an example of the expected lackluster airport food that we all know and love.  Their sandwiches are oh so delicious.  The staff has always been friendly enough when I've bought stuff from there.  I love the Cashew Blackberry Jelly sandwiches (CB&J) to the point where I've decided I should probably re-think my PB&Js that I eat at home.  The ham and cheese with the spicy mustard is incredible, and one of my favorite airport sandwiches ever.  So, why one star?  The freaking price of a sandwich.  Their prices are so bad, it's infuriating on principle.  There's no way that ANYONE should be giving this restaurant good reviews due to their prices.  Where the hell are we, on the moon?  You know how you can tell when your sandwiches are overpriced?  When someone walks in with an expense account, gets a 15% airport discount, and when they look at what $19 bought them, they can't believe it.  You know that you've lost your market when business travelers with expense accounts won't buy your product on principle of cost.  The CB&J sandwich that I mentioned earlier is $6.00, which is pretty outrageous, especially for the size of the sandwich that you get.  However, it's probably one of the better values on the menu.    And even the consistency of their pricing is way off!  Nocawich has two locations in PHX Terminal 4.  In their full service location, the cost of the previously referenced delicious ham and cheese sandwich is $9.99.  This is ABSURD.  The icing on the cake is this, though:  The exact same ham and cheese sandwich, with the same condiments, wrapped in the exact same wrapping, on the same bread, simply out of a different freezer about 150' away is $10.50.  So, you can save .51 for walking 150'.  I forget the exact cost of the CB&J at the Nocawich express location, but it's certainly not less.  Might as well walk the 150' for them to make you a fresh one!  The sandwiches are delicious, but I just can't recommend it, and this is frustrating because this would be one of my airport staples if only the pricing was realistic.  The PHX Skyharbor airport is LOADED with really good places to eat (And the so is the city!). There's literally no good reason to come here over another restaurant for these prices.  And I really wish I could!!"}
{"text":"Dining options in this terminal are limited, and I was looking for something easy that wouldn't cost a million dollars.  I ordered the cisco kid ($10.50): house roasted turkey, bacon, white cheddar, arugula, aioli, cranberry jam served on multi-grain bread. I threw in a bag of chips for good measure I think I paid $13-$14 for dinner.  The sandwich was surprisingly good. The bacon was crispy and the multi-grain bread held up really well. As far as airport sandwiches go, this is a pretty solid option.   They do have some prepackaged sandwiches that are relatively priced, but if you do have some extra time to spare, I would suggest ordering it from the counter."}
{"text":"Great food and pastries! Went about 1:00pm wasn't too busy and wait wasn't very long either"}
{"text":"As always at the airport you've got time to kill if you show up the 2 freakin' hours requested by the airlines these days. So what do you do? You eat/drink. So that's what we planned on. We were hoping to try the Four Peaks location however it was in another part of the airport sadly. So we tried Nocawich having never heard of it & really enjoyed the fried chicken sandwich. The sandwich was hot, the chicken crispy & the bread was fresh & toasted. The portion was large so we shared & it was plenty. They had Four Peaks Kilt Lifter so the hubs was very happy with that. My only issue was the register person was chatting up a storm with one of the other employees vs. taking my order. Now normally I would have probably let that weigh profoundly on my experience because the servers seem oblivious to the idea of um SERVICE but she was asked quietly by her supervisor to stop the chat & said I was waiting. Not only did she apologize but she meant it. Man alive that goes a long way. I appreciated that. Everyone makes a poor choice once in a while & she was obviously more interested in her co-workers tale of woe than taking my order. I probably would be too but she was sincere when she apologized & apologized again after taking my order. So I am just mentioning it as part of my experience. I'd go back if in that terminal again yum-my"}
{"text":"The Buffalo Cluck has to be the best thing I've ever had! The bun is so fresh and the slaw is so tasty,it's the perfect amount of everything! Best of all worlds delicious!! I can't wait to try the Green Chili Philly..."}
{"text":"I had the Nocawich Chop Salad and the quality was surprisingly good for airport food. I'll admit that the price was a little hefty at $13. But oftentimes, your airport choices are limited to those pre-packaged wilty iceberg salads with soggy toppings. For the C Gate sector of Terminal 4, I would say Nocawich is your best bet if you're looking for something healthy with fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"My sandwich was soggy and falling apart in the middle. The sandwich selection is also mediocre, which is irritating given that this is the only game in town for travelers on tight connections in this part of the airport."}
{"text":"So I went about a two weeks ago with my friend. We walked in and were not greeted. After deciding what we were going to get the cashier took my order. The whole time she gave us weird looks. As we sat down waiting for our food I noticed she forgot to give me my drink. I went up to her and told her that she forgot to give me my drink. She gave me a serious look along with the most fake smile and apology. She gave my drink and I told her thank you and she didn't say a thing. The whole time we were waiting for our food, me and my friend felt uncomfortable in there. I noticed we were the only people of color in there and I would see the same cashier discreetly looking over at us the whole time! She acted as if she had never seen a Mexican guy and a Black girl. It was kinda offensive. What got me so mad was that as we were eating a WHITE couple came in and her attitude changed Completely! She greeted them, was so energetic, asked them if it was their first time there, they said yes. She continued talking to them so friendly telling them what's the best on the menu. (When we walked in it was our first time there and she didn't even ask if we needed help. She just stared) I looked over as she was talking to the couple and she made eye contact with me and gave me this hateful stare and then proceeded talking with the couple. Her attitude was so friendly with everyone else that walked in except for us. I don't understand what she gained from that. I wish I got her name down. In conclusion, I have never felt so uncomfortable and discriminated. The food was really good! I got the Cisco Kid! Very fresh. Great Decor. Loud Music. But because of this experience, I am definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! It is rare to have a semi-healthy food choice in the airport. Everything we ordered was unique, healthy and tasty. I would have rated it even higher but the guys behind the counter were busy talking about getting trashed the night before and they were in absolutely no hurry to get food out to folks."}
{"text":"It took 40 minutes to order and receive two grilled cheese sandwiches and an order of fries.  Not sure why it was so slow but for the prices they charge I give a thumbs down.  I did enjoy the fries.  They were very good."}
{"text":"Airport food.   They were out of chicken sandwiches, so I got a burger and fries. Everything was pretty good except they use the tiniest little burger patties. You'd need a double stack to almost get a normal amount of beef.   The fries come out fresh. Crispy. They're French fries."}
{"text":"I was at ASU for a conference today and was pleasantly surprised to find this place conveniently located near the parking garage where I'd parked.  Got the Italian Stallion sandwich. Outdated stereotypes aside, it was very tasty. And I only had to wait a few minutes to get my order. I had went to the sandwich shop next door first, but there were 10-15 of my conference mates waiting in line like sheep (no offense to sheep), so I bailed and went to Nocawich. Very glad I did. The staff that took my order was a little curt and rude, but the staff that got my food was on her lunch break and saw my order was ready and got it for me, which I appreciated. I'd definitely eat here again when I'm in the area. Recommended."}
{"text":"Terrific food, fast friendly service, what more could you ask for?  Been there a couple times for breakfast and lunch, all of which is outstanding.  Breakfast specials are great, lunchtime sandwiches are amazing. Highly recommended.  Excellent pastries and cookies."}
{"text":"Ahh the elusive smoked Pastrami breakfast burrito...like a unicorn sighting, this version of food is very rare. It seems to be even rarer or discouraged perhaps to add pastrami to your morning burrito. The one meat that they are getting famous for (the pastrami) was not even an option to add to my breakfast creation. After a consultation with the cook, this order was allowed to proceed and it was a very memorable burrito. The pastrami was chopped, but did have a few fat chunks which may be better off saved for sandwiches, but still the powerful flavor really made this burro take off. Every bite had some pastrami, eggs, french fry style potatoes, green chimichurro sauce and cheese. The salsa that came with the order also had a deep depth of flavor. More importantly, with the pastrami add-on, this morning win was only 6 bucks and change. Will b e back."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Everything was fresh and tasty.  The Clubberlang was loaded with tender beef on a soft foccacia roll and topped with an onion marmalade and the freshest veggies. Will be back again."}
{"text":"I come here about once a month for work lunch and it's been consistently good. The clubber lang and what the cluck are both top notch IMO and reasonably priced. I usually go for the combo, their potato salad is super and they offer free refills of unsweetened tea which is good (not Asian good, but good enough).   Yeah."}
{"text":"Fried chicken special on Friday is great! Very flavorful and juicy and well priced. I would give it five stars on that alone... but I had a salad there before which was decent but way too expensive for what was on the plate."}
{"text":"I really like this place, the food is outstanding. I'm a big fan of the Aioli Fries. If I had one complaint, it's that this place isn't open often enough so I can't go very frequently.  This mall it's in is pretty cool as well!"}
{"text":"Didn't feel like having tacos and a previous bad experience with humble pie, I opted for this place.   Service: The lady at the counter was pleasant and quick. Off to a good start plus roasted veg sandwich with pesto, goat cheese and romesco sauce in a wheat toast sounds soooo good!   My food was taking a little long hmmm ok. Saw some toast sitting on the toaster and thought --- wow those looks awfully burnt.   Got my food. Fries and the sandwich -- no bag? Ok I'll ask for it. Here you go with the guy grumbling I gotta go home. A little unprofessional don't you think?   Fries are good but would've liked them more crispy. Opened up my sandwich only to find that burnt toast I was eyeing. I ended up deconstructing the sandwich bec the burn toast overpowered the taste. Got the goat cheese taste-- nothing special. The grilled veggies? No taste at all. Very bland! Yuck! Ended up throwing most of the sandwich away. Off to my connecting flight."}
{"text":"Do not go here unless your are ready to eat a lot!!  The first time I came here I made the mistake of ordering too much.  The portion of Thrice Cooked Fries are huge!  And the sandwiches are not skimpy either.  I learned to split a sandwich and fries with a friend.  We have tried everyone of the lunchtime sandwiches and they have all been delicious!    All the food is fresh so I recommend going early.  We have gone later in the day and they had run out of certain dishes.  Not a big deal for us as we had other options we wanted to try.  But if you are going because you want to try that one item on the menu, please take that into consideration."}
{"text":"At first I really liked Nocawich but now I'm very frustrated. They keep changing their hours and have completely removed their breakfast menu. For the most part their food is really good but the place itself  is so unreliable. They used to advertise a dinner menu too and now they're only open 10am to 3pm...make a decision and stick to it so you're customers don't walk over there only to have to find somewhere else to eat! Furthermore, they could really stand to lower their prices. In comparison to Panda Express, Cupz, and MyPie, Nocawich food is on the expensive side. At this point there's not a lot keeping me eating there anymore."}
{"text":"Oh how I love nocawich!  We were so disappointed when the location closed in Phoenix, but were happy to see it reopen in a flourishing area of Tempe.  We stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.  I enjoyed the What the Cluck sandwich - so tasty and addictive!  Great service and great space too."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new sandwich place with my friends and was very disappointed with our experience. It does have a cute atmosphere but we all did not enjoy our meals. I got the Meyer Lansky and felt that the pastrami was greasy and did not even taste like good pastrami normally does at all, would never go back or get the same dish again. It was also very overpriced for portion size and quality. My roommate simply got pastrami with only cheddar cheese and her total was 14$ no drink or side added. We left feeling Unsatisfied and with a gross taste in our mouths I would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I kept walking past this place on college thinking that I needed to drop in, and so far I've been three times and the food is really good.   The fried chicken sandwich, the lox and bagel, and the caprese all surpassed my expectations. Kind of pricey but so worth it!  The only thing that sucks is parking around this area, it's almost all meter parking.   If you're around asu or going to a game this place is definitely worth checking out. Oh! They also have beer on tap that I have yet to try."}
{"text":"The place was conveniently located near my gate, and that's about the only good thing about it. $6.50 for a cashew butter and jelly sandwich. The slices of bread were nice and thick but there was almost nothing on them. Way too expensive. Now I know better. Airports love to price gouge."}
{"text":"Neither here nor there but the best that we could find in the terminal.  We both decided just to build our own sandwiches. I went with the turkey meat and my husband ordered the roast beef.  The bread was very good. Thick and fluffy and really seemed like it was made with whole grains.   There wasn't a lot of turkey but enough to satisfy my appetite. I was also pleasently surprised to see the turkey coated with a nice seasoning.  There is just one table to sit at that just happened to be available for us so that was nice but plan on walking a bit and eating the food in your lap. Fortunately since it is a sandwich it will be pretty easy.  If we flew through this airport again I wouldn't avoid this place. It's a good affordable lunch for an airport."}
{"text":"Nocawich is a gem hidden among the usual college campus suspects. The sandwiches are super fresh on amazing bread. The fries are killer, although they seem to come out a little done for my personal taste. The only downside are their hours; I wish I could go here more often!"}
{"text":"I appreciated the skill it took to make my egg sandwich with the over easy egg and the runny yolk, however the second the egg started to run I was faced with e messy challenge to eat it. Also the bread was a bit sticky. For a side i tried the fries which are more than enough for 2 people, a small fries option for less than $5 would be nice.  This place is close to being great it just needs a few tweaks."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots! Nocawich is a fast and easy restaurant to stop in for lunch at work or between classes. The food is very and always fast, the staff is so friendly, efficient, and goes out of their way to accommodate any of your needs. Their sandwiches are easy to eat while maintaining quality, the salads are refreshing and filling, and the specialty sandwiches such as the What the Cluck and Patty Melt are decadent and comforting. Try the Kale Salad, the What the Cluck, Italian Stallion Sandwich, and any of the pastries."}
{"text":"Service is very slow so if you need a sandwich fast before your flight takes off, do not order from here. Also food quality is poor and quantity is lacking."}
{"text":"If you want the best pastrami, the best nova lox, the best Italian meat sandwich, the best fries  in all the land in a LOUD but casual environment that's hard to park at this is it!  The house made wagu pastrami is to die for. It flavorful and succulent it's like no other you'll find anywhere else.  The Italian Stallion is made up with the best Italian meats that you can't find anywhere else like finocchiona.  Fries were triple fried and have a shattering crisp outside and a fluffy moist  interior.  I took out a nova lox bagel to have for the next day. I read from the Phoenix New Times that the nova is from Russ and Daughters and is the best nova in the country and the bagel is from New York too. The Nova lox is truly the very best nova around as it's very silky in texture with a light briney taste like no other.   I can overlook the insanely loud music after all I do remember what college eateries are like. But it was so loud the cashier couldn't hear my very loud husband ordering. We also couldn't talk to each other because it was so loud. I can also overlook the parking after all I knew where I was going.  I can't give five stars because of the take out $14.00 Lox and Bagel. I got 1.9 oz of the best hand cut nova lox and not enough cream cheese to make it to the ends of the bagel. Anybody that sells a bagel and cream cheese anywhere makes a nicer put together sandwich and not one like I got. I also prefer regular capers over the cocktail capers as they don't taste the same.  This is a newly opened restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch. This restaurant is still working the bugs out.  THE BEST INGREDIENTS in a casual, LOUD small restaurant with a patio."}
{"text":"WOW! It pains me to give Nocawich (at the airport) two stars because the Brick and Mortar location served me really great food. According to our local newspaper and other publications the Chicken Sandwich from Nocawich is suppose to be a top sandwich of Metro Phoenix so we wanted to try it.  I received a squashed sandwich with slightly burnt chicken that was very drippy with a pool of white liquid. I bravely take a bite and it has a weird taste I can't identify. I DON'T think this sandwich was made right. Seemed like they turned up the oil really high and it didn't cook at the correct temperature. Curst is slightly burnt, not crisp..no flavors but oil and almost burnt.... The pickle seems good and the slaw seems fresh. The chicken is edible but this sandwich doesn't really taste good expect for the pickle.  They don't serve the triple cooked hand cut fries here like they did at the Tempe location. Instead they gave us Burger King like fries for the same price.  I do note the Onion Rings were Outstanding and only priced at around $3.50. They were delightfully crisp light and delicious. The onion also actually stayed in and didn't pull out when I ate them.  As great as the onion rings were they aren't enough for me to give this eatery more than two stars.  Maybe if you hit them when a better crew is on maybe the food is better."}
{"text":"If you are at PHX to fly to your cardiologist then this is the place to go. I was starving while I was here and even then it tasted bleh. The staff were super friendly and nice, clearly they were slammed but kept trucking thru. In all fairness, starve, its better than eating here. One star simply because I have to."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting... read a great review in The New Times and had to try it.  Counter service, not a sit down restaurant.  Will try again for a quick lunch instead of brunch with the girls."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing menu and an amazing location and vibe. I'm not one to get salads when I eat out, but their Asian salad was 10/10 top notch, I was very surprised, and was a great portion size too! I highly recommend also trying a pastry, like the Nutella ones, and sitting outside, the area it's in has some of the only shade I could find in Tempe."}
{"text":"This is for nocawich express. Absolutely terrible. Had to run through the airport and saw this little sandwich shop. Packaging looked clean and they had clever names for their sandwiches. I grabbed the roast beef sandwich and an orange juice, paid and ran to the gate. Then as I took a few bites, it was soggy, meat was tough (had to spit out a few bites) and the greens were completely wilted. Then I found the small date sticker on the package and they are selling sandwiches that have a date from 2 days ago for 13 bucks! Wtf?!? Why would they keep selling these? Gross"}
{"text":"We had a 4-1/2 hour flight from Phoenix airport to Baltimore on Wednesday  at 11 am. So we wanted a sandwich to take with us. We decided on the \"simple\" turkey sandwich on multi-grain bread with lettuce, tomato and aioli. Wow, what a delicious sandwich. Everything was so fresh and yummy.  Highly recommend it. Sandwich was only $8.00. I hope they open this restaurant in Baltimore and throughout the U.S. soon. I'll be the first in line!"}
{"text":"This place never ever disappoints. The sandwiches are always incredible. I've tried about 5-6 on the menu but my favorite always comes back to the fried chicken sandwich, which they'll smother with buffalo sauce and blue cheese sauce if you're interested. Their potato salad is also great. They have deals on Fridays for fried chicken as well. It's always my go-to spot for lunch meetings with coworkers."}
{"text":"The food here is AMazing! I have the perk of working nearby so I have tried many of the items and they are all so flavorful and fresh. The salads, muffins, burritos, and my favorite- the breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting the bad reviews but then again I've only tried one of their menu items. This review is based solely on the Tuscan Kale Salad. I added chicken so with a drink we're talking $18 bucks.  Anyone complaining about prices in the airport has apparently never eaten in an airport before. Of course you're being gouged. I am simply happy to find a healthy option surrounded by pizza and mexican food. I really appreciated the variety of ingredients in the salad. It was never boring and good to the last bite. The kale is the fibrous variety which I enjoyed but understand it may be too much for some so be prepared for that.  The added chicken wasn't necessarily anything special but I just wanted a bit of protein.  Highly recommend the salad and the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"They were quick and reasonably priced for food in an airport! Got the burger and it was made fresh. Tasted great with the warm buttered bun! Only reason not a 5/5 is b/c it's not the beat burger I've had, but pretty darn tasty."}
{"text":"great sandwiches. Nice people. Ingredients were fresh and healthy.             RBG"}
{"text":"This place is gonna be great once they have everything in stock plus staff understand the menu. We went here during game day and it was so filling. We both got patty melts...hmm yum want another . I couldn't  finish mine nor could she finish hers. We also got yummy french fries which can probably serve 4 folks. Definitely  would try again when they have the beer up and running."}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if possible.  Food is consistently awful. Go to the store across the hall and get a cliff bar instead. You won't regret it.  Staff reached into tip jar, then went back to making sandwiches without changing her gloves.   Just gross."}
{"text":"Came here and got the breakfast burrito and it was truly amazing! Really good food here and decently priced, although compared to some places nearby it is a little bit more ($8 burrito and adding meat is about 2). The restaurant is small but very cute and the staff was nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I was here the other day and I got a Caprese  sandwich, which normally is one of my favorite choices, although this one was very bland and flavorless. The bread was also chewy. The sandwich cost about 8 dollars without any sides and it definitely was not worth that much. I also decided on water as a drink and they serve their water warm in a metal container to serve yourself, no ice, which was weird on such a hot day. I noticed on the menu they seemed to be a more expensive option, which I would have been totally okay with if the flavor was there. The atmosphere was good, very cute decorations and set up, although the staff seemed somewhat confused about minor questions I had about the menu but definitely very friendly. It wasn't a terrible experience, but I probably will not return."}
{"text":"Rude and ignorant service by Paula B.Doesn't even know what's on their menu! Asked her for bebisas clearly mentioned on their menu board!   So rude and ignorant in behavior.Just ridiculous. She should be put away from the cash register for sure.   Food here is great though."}
{"text":"meh.... so, I should have found LGO or cartel. The ordering process was a little strange since they have 3 registers and each register is for their specific menu items posted above. The clerk made me feel a little foolish when she saw me looking at a different menu, offered to take my order, then proceeded to inform me I couldn't order from her.  My guy wasn't stoked on his burrito, I recall that much, though it has been a little bit since we were actually there. I do believe it was cold for the length of time we waiting. I know for sure that I was unimpressed by my cold, gelatinous glob of steel cut oatmeal. Though the pound of brown sugar it swam in was quite good, it was a little tough to enjoy the very very cold item I had received. The staff overall seemed pretty bummed to be there and the food, well, let's just say, when I find myself back, I won't be ordering here no matter how convenient it may seem."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite to eat before a flight.  Overly expensive, took forever, and the food tasted stale/old.  Wouldn't not recommend even if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Ordered a bagel and cream cheese here and was so shocked to here my total be 6 dollars. The employee noticed my shock and said the bagels are imported from New York and that's why they're so expensive.. I was really hungry and wanted a bagel so I went ahead and payed the 6 bucks. 15 minutes later I finally get my 6 dollar bagel (mind you I am the only customer in here so why it took 15 minutes is beyond me). Anyways I get the bagel and it's no better than an einstines bagel or a grocery store bagel. I was quite disappointed with my experience and was out six dollars for something I could have boughten for less than three"}
{"text":"Great made to order sandwiches with awesome thoughtful service. She asked me where I was going to eat,  I said on the plane,  she asked me to wait while she packed condiments to make it easier to eat on the plane!"}
{"text":"Subpar even for airport grab and go. Go next door to Humble Pie and place an order to-go for a far better sandwich or salad.   My husband got the roast beef sandwich, it was not fresh... At all, bland, soggy. Bleh!  I got the Simple Salad... You would think 6 ingredients would be easy to execute, however the carrots were slimy and mushy... Basically on the way to rotten. Everything else in the salad was fine but I opted to use the balsamic dressing from Humble Pie as the creamy white dressing included didn't look like the \"red wine vinaigrette\" that was supposed to be in the salad kit.   My son had the PB&J. Not much peanut butter but bread was decent.   Sorry, NOCAwich, I think you can do better."}
{"text":"We were at PHX first thing a.m. on the 4th of July.  The airport was busy with holiday travelers like ourselves.  We stopped at Nova for a quick bite before our 4-hour flight back to RDU.  The food we had (Cisco Kid Sandwich & Blutos Breakfast Bagel) were actually good as far as airport food goes.  The restaurant itself was filthy.  The lights overhead the menu etc were absolutely caked with dust and dirt.  Really gross."}
{"text":"Nocawich is definitely my favorite spot for a quick breakfast before class. Highly recommend the breakfast burrito with chorizo, never disappoints."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service which is so unfortunate for an airport. The C and D Gates there are no fast food options so you must stand in line forever for a breakfast bagel that really wasn't very good at all. Very mediocre coffee as well. $$$"}
{"text":"Prices are a little high but for the quality of the food, it's worth it. Their fries are award winning I swear! I've never had a bad meal from here. The employee (Meg) was really nice too and informed me of their punch cards they have. Delaney the manager was really great with getting us our food promptly and making sure I got everything I ordered. Will definitely come back and will be getting those fries every time!"}
{"text":"Great food, when and if they are actually open. I have tried several times to come on on a Saturday, but for one reason or another, there is always a sign on the door indicating that they are closed.. I drive down from North Scottsdale and at this point am over it.. Having good food is absolutely useless if you are never open to actually serve it."}
{"text":"I LOVED Noca.  Noca wich made fine food but there were two big issues.  1. The cook was rude - not to me - so rude that the manager/clerk had to ask him to tone it down.  2. The food took forever!!!! Almost missed my flight because I was told 10 min and it ended up being 25. I had to tell them to give me what they had and I just ran for the flight.   Shame, old Noca was good."}
{"text":"The food is good if overpriced for a campus eatery. The service definitely depends on who is working on the day you go in and whether the owner is there or not. Today the young woman who took my order was rude and unhelpful. No reason at all, just dismissive and bratty. They had the music so loud this time customers couldn't talk without yelling. I come weekly. I'm definitely going to take a break from this eatery."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other day. The girl who took our order was kind and helpful. We ordered the Patty Melt and the Cisco Kid. The Patty Melt was delicious -- hot and juicy, very flavorful. The Cisco Kid was also very good, although I think hot bacon might be better (; My only complaints are that the pickle were not tasty, and that the water (self-serve in a glass dispenser) had weird opaque/white flakes in it, so I did not eat pickles or drink water."}
{"text":"After a 4+ hour flight from Orlando we were starving and by the time we were off our flight we only had a little time between flights. Noca Wich promised speed and delivered. They also gave us tasty food but the price was exorbitant. I hate to point out price because if it is too much don't pay it. But in this instance I will because if you have time I would not recommend this place but if you don't and will pay the price, the sandwiches are good. We got two sandwiches, a salad and three bags of chips and two bottled drinks for $48. I got the \"Patsy\". It is a fried chicken patty, a spicy slaw and hot honey mustard on a kaiser. The cold chicken and the different notes from the slaw and the mustard were nice. The kaiser was nice and dense. It was a good sandwich and the kettle chips were from Deep River out of Connecticut and were delicious. Again, good sandwich but a high price."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is an actual restaurant or a hipster art gallery that occasionally serves food. Based on their limited hours, I'm inclined to go with the latter. How do they expect to attract customers if they're only open from 10-2 pm and 2-3 pm for \"pastry hours?\" I didn't realize this was Downton Abbey - mustn't be late for pastry hour. I went in 10 minutes before closing and they wouldn't serve me. Hate to be such a buzzkill, but c'mon - we're on a college campus where people are up at 2 am eating beer and burritos and vomiting in the streets. It wouldn't kill you to be a little flexible - My professor has better office hours."}
{"text":"Nocawich was extremely slow. The girl behind the register was slow and barely knew the system while the one cook took her good ol' time. I waited in line to order for 10 minutes and there was only 1 person in front of me! Two people dropped out of line because of the wait. The cook had an attitude but was able to talk or accept hugs from other workers who stopped by to talk. The food was not very good, although luckily it was edible. If you are in a rush to catch your flight I do not recommend coming here as you will either miss your boarding or you won't get your food! This place was also very pricey for a sandwich and burger."}
{"text":"Nocawich is excellent their Meyer Lansky is one of the best things I've ever eaten. The house made pastrami is a gift from whatever higher power you believe in. It's combination with Gruyere (for an extra $1) and slaw creates a sandwich which has so much flavor it should legally not exist. The amazing food does come at a fairly high price. (EDIT: there are great and very reasonable daily specials and the breakfast burrito is amazing and only $6!) A sandwich alone will cost around $12 but makes a good lunch if you're not particularly hungry."}
{"text":"Despite the construction, large crowd, grumpy passengers, and line the workers were fast and fairly friendly. Cisco Kid is an overpriced turkey sandwich but it's fresh and tasty. Add a drink and a bag o' chips and dig deep for 17 big ones!"}
{"text":"Have yet to try their sandwiches, but had their tomato soup and fries with lemon pepper aioli.   Both were delicious. Loved that the tomato soup was served piping hot and that the fries were made to order.   Wished they served breakfast all day since it's only open from 8 to 3."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Noca (the high end pre-cursor to Nocawich) and so I was interested in trying out this place and from a quality standpoint, I was not disappointed. Of course, had to have the sandwich with the house-made pastrami and even though it cost $12, it was delicious. I also tried the triple fried fries with the house-made aioli (think of it as a fancy mayo, sort of Euro thing to have it with frieds). The fries were $5 but well presented in a stainless steel bowl and the aioli was amazing. I rounded it out with a large ice tea, which was $3. If you did your math, with tax, close to $22 so if you are on a budget you might want to have the sandwich with a water, or you can go for a straight grilled cheese for only $6 (bacon is $2 extra, virginia ham is $3 extra). In all honesty, the fries are easily enough for two people and you could also split the sandwich and that is a pretty filling meal for two people so without a drink that is less than $10 a person.   Okay, going beyond price, great location on college avenue and you can sit facing the street and people watch, along with tables and bar seating - I mention the bar seating as they do have a number of craft brews on tap - though with the current hours till 2:30  I would imagine they are not selling all that much beer (of course, it is right off of ASU so I might be wrong).  Oh, and some nice outside seating that, as the weather cools down (where are you November!), I'm sure it will get used quite a bit.  As for the wait staff, professional and polite and all the food was served in a short period of time and everything seemed to be running smoothly, even as the place started to  get crowded (I arrived about 11:30 on a Friday and by the time I left their was a pretty good crowd). I do look forward to when they do dinner as well because I'm then, much more inclined to have an adult beverage with my meal but for now, the Desert Ice Tea is nice. I will definitely go back and think this is a great addition to the College Avenue Dining ecosystem."}
{"text":"Stay away.  Since there were limited options in the terminal, and I was looking for a quick breakfast before my flight, I asked for a simple oatmeal (noted on the menu with berries, walnuts, and brown sugar). The cashier was extremely disinterested in taking my order and yelled to the back to ask if they even had the oatmeal. Once confirmed - she turned to me and said \"we're out of the berries\". Alright - I was fine with that and proceeded with the oatmeal order. Sit down at my gate- opened my oatmeal container - to find a soupy mess of oatmeal and walnuts floating in a goopy sugar slop. I returned to the cash register to request an alternative item (trust me - not something I commonly do - avoid awkward confrontation whenever possible) - where the cashier had to get her manager to override the order in the system - as I asked for a bagel and cream cheese in place of my oatmeal slop. The replacement items were as equally unimpressive - and I wish I would have taken the time to eat a lower cost, better quality meal at home. Although I've had good experiences with airport meals in the past - this was not one of them."}
{"text":"5: Food- Tuscan Kale Salad at an airport?  I'm on board! I don't see this type of thing often... but when I do, I usually go for it.  It was almost on the verge of being too sweet, but felt like a good choice rather than a cookie or a big bag of nuts...  Tuscan kale, berries, pickled onions, shaved fennel, diced green onions and ummm.. a sweet vinaigrette hit the spot!   5: Customer Service- a few sweeties behind the counter prepping food and taking my money. What a treat. There were no kale salads in the cold case in the front, but they made one for me. Yea.   There was bit of a line around dinner time, but it worked, because Southwest gave me time to eat in between flights. Yea.   Would I return? Yep. They had a cashew butter and jam sandwich, the simple salad looked good too and hmmm...  I know there were other options I would have shoved in my mouth in a heart beat, just give me some more time and I may update this review.   K. Happy travels!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the prices, of course it's airport food prices. The Kale salad was tasty though! It was pretty small for the price I paid but quite tasty. The caper berry and pickled onions gave it such a great flavor. The service was super quick, which is great when you're trying to catch a flight."}
{"text":"Good burger and service, ESPECIALLY for the airport  Had some time before my flights and it was about lunch hour, so visited Nocawhich. I tried the burger, which was actually really good. Service people were funny and quick. And my order was with me within five minutes.   Drawbacks are that it's cramped with all the travelers and the prices. It hurts to pay so much for water!  Bottom line is it's a good option for travelers for pub food and a few healthier options."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the breakfast but I was too late ;( so I ordered the Cisco and out of everything I liked the bread the most (was missing the avocado)! For $9 I had a very small cold sandwich. Hopefully next time will be better.."}
{"text":"I wanted a breakfast burrito at the place next door, but they weren't open yet (kept telling people 15 minutes), so I opted for a breakfast bagel here. It was quite long wait to get my food. Airport restaurants never seem to have a sense of urgency. But I was able to wolf down my sandwich before having to board and it was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Terrible coffee cake. Great chicken sandwich. Very impressed with what the cluck. It has hearty seasonings which you don't expect from a deep fried chicken. A little bit of spice too! The home made pickle made it. They got the food out to me super fast. I was impressed. But to receive a 5 star rating everything has to be good. And their cake wasn't great. Also their card reader machine stopped working. So it took 5 minutes to just place an order."}
{"text":"OMG new favorite lunch spot near campus! This place is so easily missed, but man do not keep walking because their sandwiches are AMAZING. Today my friend had my try it, and after I did I am so glad she brought me here!! The reviews and photos do NOT do it justice. It's such perfect place to eat lunch and they have a hybrid indoor/outdoor setting. The staff is friendly and helpful.   I ordered the Caprese and tried their Nutella Loaf. The loaf was great!! But OMG the sandwich!! BEST CAPRESE I'VE EVER HAD! The bread was perfection and it was definitely worth the $8! Side pickle was a plus!   Besides the food, my favorite part is the setting. On a Fall afternoon it feels so relaxing to sit in a booth and enjoy a 5-star sandwich! I will definitely be returning for lunch dates with friends. Can't express enough how excited I am that I was introduced to this delicious spot!!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty but the service was not friendly. I get we all hate our jobs sometimes but at least try to be nice."}
{"text":"Fast service today. I ordered the CB&J (cashew butter and blackberry) sandwich on wheat and they used white instead. A nice snack either way! Will be back to try other options. They have a veggie sandwich named The Gwenyth I must order next time."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy. You can see them cook your eggs for the breakfast bagels. Food wasn't too greasy it was just the right amount. Had there Bluto's Breakfast Bagel and it was yummy. It had eggs, bacon, has brown, Chedda (this is how they spell it on the menu), Romesco  sauce on a toasted bagel.   It was yummy and hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing and and the portions are huge! You can add or change anything you want about an item! For example: I looove the caprese sand which but I always add chicken and avocado! They make their pastries, bacon, and bread in house... safe to say it pays off. The only downside to this place is that they close a bit early and aren't open on the weekends. 10/10 would recommend! I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"Worth the walk from another gate!! Not bad for an airport sandwich went with the cisco kid $10.50. Sandwich was large had good flavor plenty of meat and tasty multi grain bread. Better then the other choices around."}
{"text":"Limited menu but love their kale salad. It's the perfect combination of flavors and textures. I go just for this salad! I tried it for the first time at their location in the airport and crave it from time to time so I'm glad they have a Tempe location. I haven't tried their sandwiches but from what I've seen, they look fresh but a little on the smaller side, especially for the price.   Cute little spot in downtown Tempe near ASU's campus so parking can be tricky during lunch time. They have outdoor seating which is nice. Be aware of their limited hours."}
