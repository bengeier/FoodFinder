{"text":"I think the Sub I ate here was one of the best I've ever eaten, expecially having the Sub Grilled really made the difference for me."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Just ordered a Louisiana chicken wrap and the employee refused to give me the Wednesday discount, said it doesn't apply for wraps only subs."}
{"text":"I prefer Mr.Sub over Subway. This location here is quite small but has few seating. The server and service are very friendly and quick. The restaurant was clean as well. There is plenty parking.  It gets quite busy around lunch time during week days so be ready to get there a bit early."}
{"text":"Never been a fan of Mr.Sub but decided to give this one a try. On a lunch break from work I arrived before noon so it was quiet. Staff was pleasant and attentive.   Food was average for sub shop. Bread was dry and hard to bite through. Toppings were barely fresh. Meat was ok. Sauces were nasty. Sub sauce tastes like it was off and mayo had no taste. I had asked for a little bit of black pepper and instead I got enough to suffocate a horse.   Overall disappointing experience but honestly I did not really expect much better. Definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Clean, fast and professional, great staff at this location now.  Every time I visit Mr Sub I am pleased to be reminded that they are far tastier than Subway :)"}
{"text":"Great staff, quick service, very clean place. Delicious sandwiches! Panini toaster is a great thing. If you like subway, you'd love this place."}
{"text":"The staff here has been getting progressively more dire the last few times I've been here. Honestly if I did this at work I would have been fired the first week. I have been going to this location for almost 3 years now for its convenience and closeness, but the service is getting worse and worse. They usually only acknowledge you in order to take your order, don't smile and may or may not actually listen to what you are asking for. Service can be slow for such an unbusy restaurant. And today my change was placed on the counter almost behind the register instead of in my hand? I was not even offered a receipt and the employee who took my change left after placing the coins there. I always present the customer with their receipt and change into their hand, it's common courtesy that these employees cannot seem to grasp. The subway across the street is more expensive and less tasty but more worth it cause the employees are generally pretty chipper."}
{"text":"*Insert unoriginal make me a sammich joke*  I came here for a Turkey sandwich. Choices are pretty similar to Subway when it comes to bread, toppings, and sauces. I appreciate the panini toaster. Way better than Subway's toaster. Reminds me of Blimpie.  Wonderful and quick service. Clean place. If you like Subway and want to try something new yet familiar then consider checking this place out."}
{"text":"With the closure of the two Mr. Sub locations in the Church & Wellesley area of Toronto (both stores closed due to the pending demolition of the buildings they leased their space from; new high-rose condos will replace them), this is now the only Mr. Sub location located nearby. With modern decor and sizeable dining area, this is the nicest location I've been to ever. Located across the street from Toronto Police's 52nd Division, most patrons tend to be cops or health workers from nearby hospitals. Prices are a bit high for some sandwiches and coupon offers are extremely rare (unlike rival Subway), however as an American residing in Canada, I hands down prefer Mr. Sub over the competition.  Service at this location is good and never had any complaints about it. Definitely will return back in the near future."}
{"text":"I can confidently say that this Mr.Sub is the best I have been to.   The owner and the staff are always very nice and welcoming. They take their time to prepare your sandwich but are also very efficient. The establishment is always clean and well kept. Their toppings always appear fresh and neat."}
{"text":"First time to this location. Service was fast and friendly. I found them a little Stingy on the toppings. Overall I would go back."}
{"text":"If the Filipino lady serving me could have only cared more - to stop talking to her friend - while repeatedly asking me to repeat my order and listened to my while I kept correcting her while she made my order- I may have enjoyed my experience today.  Alas, she had much more important things to do, than her job!   Terrible experience.   I'll never be back to this store."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been here, so please excuse any antiquity that may surface in this review, but for someone who does not like Subway or Mr. Sub restaurants, this location is fantastic.   For starters, it's very clean. The tables are kept wiped down and free of debris, and there are newspapers to read for customers.  The chairs are also clean and fairly comfortable.   Secondly, the staff. All very friendly and the service is fast. You order and have your food in under 5 minutes, even on the busiest day. They keep the line moving, all while being very friendly and courteous.  Lastly, the bread. Actually fresh, not just called fresh.   Only minus is the mushrooms are canned and a bit mushy, but it's kind of expected given the nature of the business. That's it. All in all a fantastic business.  Worth the trip"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Canada.....I gotta have the cold cut sub with everything on it and special sauce.....and then micowave it to get it soft and melty. It is better than Subway"}
{"text":"Great service & great quality. Rather drive farther to this Mr.Sub than others. Facilities are clean. Owner of this location has done a great job!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and fast service!   I have gotten their cater platters a couple of times. They have always given us discounts($10 off was the last one). They are always on time and they carried the boxes to my car! The above and beyond part was when they called after the first time to ensure we got everything we needed.    Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This was another spot I went when I first arrived to the Meadowvale business area.  Like most fast food chains, this one looks like every other Mr. Sub I ever been to.  It was clean, with a little bit of seating, and when it comes to the lunch hour, there is ia bit of a wait.  I found this place to be a bit on the slow side but they weren't too cheap with their toppings.  During the lunch hour, it can be easily a 10 minute wait to get your sub.  Fridays are just nuts.  When I went, the girl server was nice but holy cow, was she ever slow.  She merticulously laid everything out onto the sub in a pretty way.  The guy on the other hand, was faster but its was clear he was trying to make up for his slow partner.  Veggies flew about and the sauce was landing everywhere.  You can definitely ask for more veggies than they give you and they'd oblige your request.  All in all, nothing ground shaking but nothing great about this location."}
{"text":"not a huge fan of topping placement in the subs, but the meatballs are very good tasting. they have a bouncey rubber texture to them that i like over subway's meatball's. also Subway has a weird smell to their chipotle sauce that Mr. Sub doesn't so that's another bonus."}
{"text":"I don't mean to sound unpatriotic, really. And I wouldn't even call myself an enthusiast of that *other* place. But Mr. Sub is gangly and weird and unmistakably Canadian. You almost want to apologise with every bite.  Mr. Submarine is the creation of a pair of Yorkville hippies around the centennial. I'll spare you the back story, but I'm sure it involves bellbottoms, and Trudeaumania, and weed. Some forty years later, Mr. Sub is still at it: making creepy breads in \"small\" and \"large\" and shredding lettuce so thin, it could work in Milan.   Anyway: my sandwich guru (or whatever) does get points for reaching to the fridge to get a cold beverage. That's a nice touch.  Obligatory Title Pun: Going DOWN.   Menu Readability: Blah.  Need to mention: The sandwiches here are OK.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'll do anything  for an FTR."}
