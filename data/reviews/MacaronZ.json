{"text":"It's a cute little place however I think they would have done better at Square One. The macarons are ok, I've had better. With all the hard work and headaches involved in making macarons I can see why they are $2 each. If you are looking for something sweet and special to give as a gift and are tired of giving out chocolate, this would be a nice option. They also have cupcakes which I think have a lot of sugar and egg whites in them as the texture reminds a bit of macarons. If they were closer I'd probably visit again but will not drive there just for the macrons alone. Oh, and speaking of gift giving they do have a small stand with some very simple but interesting jewelry from Paris. Again, it's a cute little place.  You must go there see for yourself."}
{"text":"Macarons were really tasty. A bit too sweet for my taste, but overall they were delicious! 
  My friend and I bought half a dozen each, but when they opened their box they saw that they were missing a macaron. We went back to the store and the staff there were very accommodating. They apologized and gave her an extra 2 macarons, free of charge. Great service!
  If I'm ever in the area, I'll definitely be stopping by here to try out some more of their flavours."}
{"text":"The macaroons are delicious here and always fresh! Highly recommend if you love them. Haven't tried their cakes though, but probably delicious as well."}
{"text":"Had some macarons yesterday and I loved them!  They tasted fresh and has a slight chewiness which I love!  When you bite into them, you can actually differentiate the different flavours and there are a good number of flavours to try.

It's a cute little shop on Queen street...its quite small so if you're not really looking for it, you might miss it when walking by.

When you walk in, it smells so delicious and the lady there is so pleasant.

Macarons aren't a cheap dessert but I'll still pay to get some!  We got six for $12.  Cash only."}
{"text":"I get so confused every time I walk in and see macarons with different colors, and different flavors. It's so hilarious because I expect a certain flavor to have a certain color so now we all know that our eyes play silly tricks on us! 

In a quaint little storefront that is easy to miss - a very small gem of a shop is located not even steps away from the Brampton Library. MacronZ is definitely a cute little place with a big heart. 

As you walk in, the whiff of fresh macarons hits you in the face, and as you stare at the board to the left of you, your heart fills with desire as you see the flavors they have in stock, as well as the seasonal ones too! 

My absolute favorite would have to be the pistachio, cookies and cream, and ube flavoured macarons! Not only did these score serious brownie points, but the designs, oh the designs were absolutely amazing! So much love and care goes into making these delectable desserts that if you were to just have one bite, you'd be hooked! 

One thing I will mention, however, is that they only take credit or cash so if you go to check them out, make sure you bring either or along with you! I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good location 

Con: hours are short and macarons are nothing special.

I usually go quite a far stretch to get a good dose of macarons . heard about it and had to try ....

Macarons were dry and hard. Flavors didn't stand out much. Disappointing"}
{"text":"I have never physically been here myself but my boyfriend got two boxes of Macarons for me in replacement for a birthday cake, since I'm not a huge fan of cakes.

The Macarons were made soft, chewy and delicious. Everyone at my birthday dinner raved about them and had to know where he had gotten them.

He found a secret gem downtown Brampton. I'm so happy there is a shop so close to home. I'll be grabbing myself more of these. I just love them so much."}
{"text":"Cute little bake shop in the heart of downtown Brampton. We have booked a Sunday High Tea session for a group of 6. Reservation is needed ahead and they have two sessions (12:45-2:45pm & 3:00-5:00pm). There are only 3 tables in there (one can accommodate a party of 6, another one for about 4 and the last one for a party of 2). The decor is really nice and the high tea experience was great. The owner greeted us and she was really nice. She offered a selection of tea from Sloane Tea (a Toronto base company). I picked the creamy black tea and it was delicious. We each got our own tea pot, and baked good tray which was very nice and pretty (picture worthy for sure, bring your camera) The menu vary but we all got the same that day. 2 mini quiches (Tomato and a Cheese & Herbs) a Cream Scone with Cream & Mrs. V's Preserves, 2 French Macaron (we got the one caramel and one chocolate dipped),  a Shortbread Cookie and a Strawberry Profiterole. We paid $20 each but I think they have just raised their prices to $25. This is a great place for a girls date. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Macarons in colour of rainbows.... Hot Pink? Turquoise? Peach? Dark Green? Deep Violet? Sexy Red?

The funny thing is some of the colors has no direct coordination to the flavours..... 

The macarons at $2 each though not the best I had but the flavours are quite intense! Love the real pieces of pistachio in the butter cream filling!

The set up though a little awkward, not too welcoming for staying in.

I would wait for my Yelp friend do a review on the $3.95 peanut butter tart... at that price, it better be good?"}
