{"text":"I had a horrible experience at this restaurant because the dish I ordered was terrible - it was one of the chicken dishes with coconut milk and basil leaves. There were so many basil leaves in the plate and it was ridiculously overwhelming. My husband's beef dish was better but nothing extraordinary. The decor is very nice but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The decoration is nice but that is where the experience stops. A little noisy like most restaurants in Laval. Doesn't do Thai food justice - somewhat bland and the curries are too liquid.  It took a very long time not only for them to take our order but also for us to get served.  We watched the tables around us and we weren't the only ones.  The table next to us complained about how slow things were.  When their food finally came out, they received everything at once rather than in separate services."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars because I love the \"rouleaux printanier\" there. I've never had an actual meal but their spring rolls as fantastic!"}
