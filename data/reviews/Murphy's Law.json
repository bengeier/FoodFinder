{"text":"In business in Chandler and stopped by here. It's not as fancy as some of the other places but wanted good food and good drinks. Was not disappointed. Sapphire was my sever (yes she said it with a straight face and I bit my tongue) but she was very cool. Worth a Friday night outing. Music not too loud either so you could chat no problem."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing. Very welcoming, there is live music and array of beer choices. The staff is fantastic and helpful. Especially Chauney the bartender! He is very polite and went out of his way, very helpful!"}
{"text":"Great wings. OK food. Horrible service. I think the bar tenders are drunk. Stumbling and acting dumb. Our server has 3 tables and we have been waiting 20 min to get a refill on our drinks. Again while 2 guys behind the bar are having a blast being loud and dumb. This will probably be my last time here.. sad cuz the wings were awesome."}
{"text":"love love love this bar. has a neighborhood dive bar feel (casual, comfy, friendly, good beer, good food) but it's still clean and classy and just an all around inviting environment. my go to bar for sure. and if Jerome or Jeffrey is your bartender there's no way you'll have a bad night!  thanks guys"}
{"text":"We love to make this one of our stops when we go downtown! I love the wacky décor and we always have good service. It's been a while since we have eaten there (not since it was Irish Republic), but the food was good. They have a large beer selection and I've tried several of the \"blended beers\" from the menu, my favorite being the white chocolate (mix of vanilla porter and chocolate beer..sounds strange, but it is delish!) They also carry my favorite blueberry beer (Big Blue Van). They make a great Moscow Mule, but beware...they take your drivers license so you won't steal the copper cup. This is a huge put off for me as I feel they are accusing their customers of stealing. I'm sure this has happened in the past, but come on...FYI Bourbon Jack's does not do this.   One improvement I have noticed since becoming Murphy's Law again is that the place no longer smells like urine. I had posted a review back when it was the Irish Republic House about the overwhelming urine smell (it was ok in the front, but the closer you would get to the bathrooms the smell became unbearable and you could not sit back there.) Something obviously got fixed and I don't think scented candles (I saw another review about to many scented candles) could have masked that retched smell.   Live music on the weekends, but we always leave before that...don't like to sit and yell my conversation, but I'm sure the bands are good!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a bar I will visit more often. The live bands and atmosphere is something not worth missing. Our server Sapphire was very attentive and had great food and drink recommendations. Love the chicken skewers. Keep up the outstanding work!"}
{"text":"Went back and was totally impressed! Shey is the BEST!! Glad I was wrong about them...the food was really good and atmosphere was comfortable. As for Shey, she was awesome!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast with our family on Sunday morning. The omelet my husband had was good, my French Toast was well prepared but tasteless. Other people in our party also stated that their food was tasteless. The Bloody Murphy was good. We were a party of 12 and when our separate bills came none of them were correct. Everything was mixed up. The service was a little slow and oneg person in our party was not served until everyone else was done eating. I think the service would have been fine if our party was 2-4 people.  The manager/owner did nothing to help our server who we found out is new and not trained to handle large parties. We are now told managements solution is to fire the server. Terribly unfair to an inexperienced worker when it is the managers fault for not stepping in and helping her and properly training her in the first place."}
{"text":"Best wings in town and a good beer selection! Plus the live band was great...dueling pianos tonight! They were awesome!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident and am so happy I did!! It's fun, friendly and busy on weekends!! Plus if you're a Seahwaks fan this is your place in AZ!! The food is good and the beer selection is solid! I recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, food plain  over 2 hours to get food and bill to pay and still was wrong. Will no and highly recommend that you don't go save your money and time. If I could have I would rate a no star."}
{"text":"Went there on the weekend during a festival on top of getting seated in the corner of outside took awhile for the server to get to us she took our order and after coming to check on us several times was unsure why food was still not ready even after people who were seated after us got there food and left. There server apologized and said would get a manager due to she felt bad when the assistant manager a blond that was hosting up front and really didn't her job she came over and didn't really apologize stated our food goes in order even though I pointed it took over 45 minutes she said I'm not going to argue with you and left, even after I told our server that a couple of our orders were wrong. Service was okay but hostess/manager was terrible and no customer service skills or couldn't even handle how to seat people or seating chart due young Hispanic girl was doing her job. Bad representation of establishment."}
{"text":"This fabulous place is NOT closed!  Sitting here enjoying a wonderful breakfast on this Sunday morning.  Corned Beef Hash is excellent.  There is nothing canned about it...homemade corned beef with bell peppers, onions and cabbage...unique and excellent.   My daughter ordered the Breakfast Sandwich, which they do in a half size for kids.  Excellent service...our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  Also let us know they are under new ownership...thus the mistakenly reported closure.  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, food is pretty solid, nice selection of beers, staff is great. Happy Hour EVERY day of the week. Stop by, say hi, they won't dissappoint."}
{"text":"Great food and bartender Zac is not only gorgeous and sexy he is one hell of a bartender!"}
{"text":"I love coming to murphys and I get excellent service every time without question.  I just recently stopped by to get my favorite Jameson wings which are by far my favorite.   I was extremely disappointed to learn my Jameson wings now only come smoked.  I've tried the smoked Jameson wings and they do not even come close to my favorite Jameson chicken wings.  Bring em back!"}
{"text":"Terrible \"Sunday Brunch\"!  They advertise \"bottomless\" champagne Mimosa's but they pour mostly oj!  They are super stingy with refills and they ran out of 1 of the only 4 items available to eat. Would not recommend, staff is pleasant enough but brunch stinks!!"}
{"text":"This place is money! Literally, it's all over the walls! If you're smart about it you can take enough off the walls to cover your tab. Just make sure to come up with a good excuse as to why you are paying with singles and you wrote all over your money. I went with \"I'm a struggling artist and I play guitar on the streets for cash.\" Clearly a lie but I tipped Sapphire really well because as Bobby G said she has beautiful eyes and gave great service even if the bartender/manager Madea  (from Tyler Perry?) was slow.  Anyway, go to Murphy's, drink some beers, eat some food and love thy neighbor, hakuna matata, eat a lot of leafy greens...that's all I got. Happy 2016."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite Sunday spot. Sapphire is the bomb.com. She's always happy and a good time. Such a great bar! Bottomless mimosas.....can't beat them!"}
{"text":"Been here for the 2nd time and holy grail! On a Monday, By far the best Irish pub you can go to in chandler. Awesome bartender J s tye deal and what started our evening. Tok care of us and our needs. Love the place, company, service, drinks, food amd environment. This is my go to spot everytime im in chandler. It's lit!"}
{"text":"I have watched the bouncer be physically violent and the staff treat its patrons like they are nuisances. This place has gone downhill because of the people who work there.  San Tan Brewery is 100 yards away. No-brainer to go there, where the food, beer and, most importantly, customer service, are top-notch. Avoid Murphy's Law. Trust me."}
{"text":"So sad.  We used to love this place and I'm still trying to like it again but the Guinness was warm when my husband finally got his pint.  I asked for a snake bite which I used to get but with harps instead of Guinness. Wrong. Waitress blamed the bartender but I could see from my seat it was the wrong combo. Redo and all cider. Irish pub nachos started ok but were burned on the bottom layer and the grease was pourable. Food took loooonnnggg to arrive. At 6:20 they cranked up the music and conversation became impossible for the dinner crowd. Saturday night and they were half empty."}
{"text":"We go here every year on the evening of the downtown tree lighting and parade.  They have wonderful service, Christmas music playing, and delicious food!  This year my daughter got one of their specials for desert, a blackberry cobbler-yum!  Our waitress was named Sapphire, and she was dressed up for the holidays with her reindeer ears, and she was very friendly.  Great experience-highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe this place is still around, the food was disgusting, burnt and had to be sent back twice, the service was even worse, I was so embarrassed taking friends there and having to order everything from the bar because our waitress took over 30min to bring the menus, forgot our drinks and said it was because the bar was backed up, really?! There was hardly anyone sitting at the bar. We will never go back to such an aweful place."}
{"text":"Worst server ever. Asked for Malibu she came back with Sky bc that's rum too. No sweetie that's vodka. Doesn't understand tall is a bigger glass, doesn't mean double. Had to track her down several times. I get it hire the cute girls but at least teach them. It was embarrassing. Then to fix our check at end of the night, still think it was way wrong!"}
{"text":"Murphy's is like the place to go when you wanna feel like you're drinking with your high school buds again! Our bartender Steve was the man! He made us every moronic drink we asked for.  Laughs all night long every time we come in. I owe these 5 stars to Steve the bartender! He always remembers our names and make sure we have the best time!"}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere is just as you'd wish.   I had 2 Guinness, poured properly.  It's a solid place to have a beer and enjoy the scenery."}
{"text":"We signed up for the dueling piano updates and got 1c drinks and a free appetizer one night! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Awesome food, service and entertainment! I recommend the peanut butter and jelly shot, bottle of champagne and Irish breakfast for Sunday brunch and the BEST wings you'll ever have on Thursdays for the dueling pianos. I love this place! Bring all of my friends from out of town here when they visit, and Murphy's NEVER disappoints!!"}
{"text":"So my wife and I walked around the area and decided to check this place out.  I am a sucker for a great Reuben and Irish food.  The atmosphere is typical pub style.  We were pretty excited that we landed there during happy hour.  For an app we ordered the pretzels.  Normally $9.95 they were around $5.95 during the happy hour.  I would only hope that they give you more than 4 pieces in a non-happy hour order for that much.  They were good just not all worth $9.95.  For lunch I had the Irish burger.  Corned Beef mixed with beef.  If not for the description I would have never guessed there was Corned beef in it.  Very overdone and it just tasted like beef.  My wife had the Sheppard's pie.  Served in an extremely awkward dish, it was pretty good.  The beef was tender and the mashed potatoes were good but there was an overpowering flavor that we could not pin point.  The service was just ok.  We asked about the happy hour and the bartender just said, \"yes\".  She never explained anything or offered anything and seemed very preoccupied with everything else.  I ordered a beer and then realized that (I thought) the beer was on the happy hour and I could have gotten the larger one. When I asked if the beer I was drinking was on the happy hour she said no.  I asked about a different beer and she said it was on the happy hour.  When the bill came, it was not. Oh well, my fault for not paying attention.  Overall, it was just ok."}
{"text":"What a ripoff.  They advertise happy hour $4.00 craft beers and when I asked the bartender Shyonia what the happy hour beer specials were she told me...Bud, Coors and Milller.....so i end up paying  $12.00 for two warm drafts. WTF ! Since when are they craft beers.....what a horrible bartender....left quickly and went down to San Tan...better beer and knowledgeable staff to boot."}
{"text":"If I could mark a negative amount of stars I would. We went into this place for lunch and ordered ice tea first. When we asked for sweetener from the bartender, he threw it at us and stated, \"We drink here. Take your sweetener and don't fucking come back.\"  This is completely unacceptable treatment even at a bar.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow, I was expecting so much less and was pleasantly surprised! What a wonderful atmosphere! Wonderful bartenders! More than all that; wonderful, spectacular wings! So tender! So filled with flavor! Smoked then fried!!  Drinks were all good, hubby had a 7&7, I had vodka cranberry...and a gin & tonic. We each had a beer...i tried the grapefruit ipa l, and hubby had the harp.   Can't wait for another datenight out to this awesome place"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was AMAZING! Tried a Reuben for the first time and it was mouth watering! Our server was very helpful and personable. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I just called Murphys Law, and it is NOT closed!!! Not sure why it says that at the top of the yelp page?!?! Great place for fish and chips!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends one night because San Tan Brewery was way too packed and we figured this would do as it's an Irish pub. Wanted a hot toddy because it was cold. Waitress had to check if they would actually make one for me. Luckily they could. However, they were out of Shepherd's Pie. WTF? What kind of Irish place runs out of Shepherd's Pie just before 7pm during the dinner rush? So I settled for the Bangers and Mash. They were good - sure. But that was not what I walked through the door hoping for. Grrr. At least the hot toddy was just the way I would make it at home. Service was adequate. Atmosphere was chaotic and noisy and most of the seating is along a long pathway that has the feel more of a busy diner than the kind of restaurant where you want to hang out and drink and chill. Rather than hanging out with friends here for hours, we opted to scarf our food and GTFO. Not sure if I'll be back again. Lots of parking in the neighborhood if you time it right and get lucky - probably better luck during the regular weekdays."}
{"text":"Another outstanding service from Murphys! I would consider buying a shirt from this place. I TOTALLY recommend this place if you're in the Chandler area!"}
{"text":"Terry was an amazing bartender. Drinks were great, conversation was great, and no matter how busy it was we had a drink. Great night!"}
{"text":"Wife and I for lunch. Pub burger and lunch special bbq chicken. Both very good and very ample quantity! Onion rings better after they cooled a bit and lost some of the \"oily\" feel. Server Shyonia very helpful and friendly. First time eating lunch here and enjoyed and would recommend it."}
{"text":"NOT CLOSED. Still open. Seems like the same staff from my last visit almost 18 months ago is still here actually. The happy hour has good food and drink specials. I tried the tumblers, which should be shared. This contained cheese, potatoes, chives and bacon deep fried and served with chipotle ranch. If you eat all eight and your over 40, heartburn will be headed your way. The corned beef is still pretty good as well. Had the reuben and the beef is still crumbly and the cheese and kraut make this a solid choice always. Only $4 for a large domestic beer. Place was somewhat crowded on a Thursday happy hour, but still an enjoyable time. They DO NOT have the baseball package, so that is one negative."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come after work or even some date nights. Live bands on Fri and Sat nights. The menu is pretty good, with some good Irish themed dishes and drinks are the typical Irish pub types, too. My husband loves it and crowds are a nice 30 something most times so we feel like we fit right in. Great casual place and always lovely in thebDC."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorites when I lived in Chandler.  We decided to go back last Saturday.  He was craving their Irish version of a French dip and I *needed* the Jameson meatballs.  We got a table quickly and the waitress handed us menus.  Uh oh.  New menus.    Come to find out, the dip and meatballs weren't even on the menu anymore.  We were so disappointed that we left.  The waitress hyped the burgers...well, there are a ton of burger joints.  We wanted pub food and it's not available here anymore. We won't be returning unless they bring back old faves."}
{"text":"GREAT food, GREAT atmosphere.  We went on an extremely busy day and we got seated immediately.  Service was promptly and friendly.  We'll be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Murphy's Law last night with some friends to see the dueling piano players. They were very fun and entertaining. I have nothing bad to say about them. At the end of the night when I was paying the bill, my husband stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. On his way back in he accidentally bumped into the bouncer and the big fat black bouncer threw my husband to the ground. He had no reason to do this. I cannot believe that this happened. It was a complete accident that he bumped into him. Is this how you run your business Murphy's Law? I cannot believe that this is okay. I quickly ran outside and asked the bouncer why he was doing this and he even told me that my husband bumped into him. Bumping into somebody...that gives you the right to throw somebody to the ground just because you're an employee? Not cool.  We will not be going back there."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, and at dinner time was a bit loud (it is a bar after all), but there was not a lot of people for it to be that loud.  They were getting ready to have karaoke night, so it got very busy very quickly.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"A small but friendly Irish bar. Fun place with standard Irish fare.  Big bar and great wait staff.  If you like Irish food this is the place in downtown Chandler.  Had the  Shepard's pie. It was great."}
{"text":"They were packed but we got seated immediately and had good service, despite how overloaded our waitress was! The food was excellent and the beer selection was amazing!"}
{"text":"Since the our first visit to Murphy's months ago, it is our go to Friday night place! We always take out of town guests there. They have the best fish and chips, pretzels and cheese and wings anywhere. The servers are fun and helpful. We enjoy the authentic atmosphere. Of course the complimentary Guiness brownie with food purchase is a bonus. On our first visit we had a large pretzel and pretzel stick combo with beer cheese. We wish that combo were available all the time because we like both types of pretzels. The craft beer selection is good. Anyhow, Murphy's is our recommendation for a fun and tasty experience!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink last night after work with a small group. My waitress Sapphire was quick to grab us drinks in a timely fashiom. She made a note to point out daily promotions so will be back to try fish and chips!!"}
{"text":"Happened to go for brunch, love there idea for their mimosa bucket. A bottle of champagne and unlimited OJ, food was great but they were really stingy with the OJ felt bad every time we asked for it..."}
{"text":"Such a great place with amazing beer selection. The Bartender Steve was so helpful and recommended we get Jameson wings. I will Definetly be back to see stee and a plus is... he is super hot"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Our waitress Molly was the best!  Fish and chips and chicken sandwich were both excellent. I highly recommend this place.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I came here to escape this creepy guy with a goatee at Bourbon Jacks and I stayed for the good music and Smithwick's.  Seriously, the band playing was amazing. There was this one guy with long luscious hair that looked like he was having intimate relations with his guitar. It brought a tear to my eye."}
{"text":"Wow! And not in a good way! I have never been treated so badly in my life! The service is absolutely abysmal, rude, and uninterested. I'm a bartender myself, and this place could be an absolute goldmine, but I have never seen a staff less interested in making money than this place. Staff also seems very pissed off at each other, which might be the problem, if I was the owner I would be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food. Horrible service. Love coming here for the food and atmosphere. But never fails, service is slow and servers are never around."}
{"text":"Ehhh......its ok. The bar seems outdated.  The dollar bills on the wall, is just lame. Beer selection was ok, staff was good. The menu to me just didn't seem inviting, I didn't order any food, after looking at it for 30 min.  Ehhh......better options within walking distance."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great service when they're busy. Bartenders are nice and fast. Great place!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love their brunch, other food has gone downhill. Make sure you sit at bar for good service, otherwise, forget it."}
{"text":"Bottomless Mimosas from 10am-12pm on Saturday's and Sunday's for $14! This restaurant is located in the heart of Downtown Chandler with cute shops and a farmers market across the street. They serve both breakfast and lunch in the morning for a decent price and a lot of food. I went during the soccer playoffs and the servers happily turned on TVs and sound for the customer's enjoyment. I had the bacon breakfast sandwich with fruit while my boyfriend had the basic breakfast with two eggs, meat and toast. We were definitely satisfied and eager to come back over the St. Patrick's holiday. Loved the décor and money walls!"}
{"text":"4 stars are only because it is very tight and hard to watch the band.  Good bar, good location, and I have not had the food yet."}
{"text":"In my experience of going to Murphy's Law Irish Pub, I had wonderful service, and food. They have a special every day of the week. Wednesday is two for one fish and chips, this is what my mother and I got. I'm usually not very big of fish, but fried fish is another story. Although I had never tried fish and chips before, and my mother had not tried them from Murphy's. This was going to be a new experience for both of us.   When we got to Murphy's there was a menu outside, my mother and I decided to look at it before we went in. Although this menu did not show the daily specials, as soon as we stopped to read it a very kind waitress walked out the door and waited politely until we were ready to walk in. She wasn't just a host, she was our waitress also. After we ordered, she was very fast to get our drinks and she was always good at noticing when my soda was getting empty. This is what I like in my waiter/waitress, because I absolutely hate when I'm sitting there with an empty drink. It took a little longer to get the food but that was because we ordered fried fish, which can take a little bit longer sometimes. The fish was very good and not too greasy, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"I have to say I do appreciate the professional and respectful way the owner responds to any less than favorable reviews, not that there have been many.  Some owners are insulting and go into attack mode.   I ate there recently for the first time on a Friday during lunch time.   I noticed that San Tan Brewing company was packed and had a waiting list.  I hate how loud the music was at San Tan Brewing company though and didn't want to wait in line. ( I have never eaten there)  Any way I was surprised that Murphy's Law was pretty dead and the people who were in there were all well over 50 years old.  Everyone had white hair.  There is nothing wrong with older people, in fact I am middle aged too.  I see why they go there instead of San Tan Brewing because the music is so loud for lunch time there and San Tan is trying so hard to be hip and trendy.   The waitress at Murphy's Law was excellent, really outstanding. I don't remember her name but she was young, fair skin and reddish hair.   The fish and chips were way over priced I thought.  They tasted ok but weren't the best I've ever had.  The glass my drink was served in had not been washed properly and I could taste the previous person's drink on the top edge of the glass.  The waitress handled this issue beautifully and professionally.   The person at the table next to me had the loaded potato soup and it looked amazing.  I wish I had ordered that.   It has potential and I hope the owner can make a go of it."}
{"text":"excellent fish and chips, burgers....wait staff alert"}
{"text":"This is less Irish Pub and more Irish Hooters. The only thing \"Irish\" about this place is the amount of liquor and Celtic fonts on the menu. The first thing we noticed was the short skirt on our waitress, paired with knee high boots - way to be subtle, Murpheys! She was nice though. Ambiance wise, they played classic rock and the Tvs were set to sports, fishing, and more sports. We ordered potato soup and chicken tenders. The soup was good but almost too rich, I could only eat half the cup. The chicken tenders wee over cooked, the batter had a rubbery texture and tasted like old fries. I also had the bread pudding, it was ok (a far superior one can be had at Mimi's Cafe). For those 3 items it came to 27$, and we had to physically go in search of our check as our waitress disappeared - there was just her and the bartender during weekday lunch. Look, this is a sports bar, geared towards men, as proven by the patrons we saw there. Want a REAL Irish pub vibe? Go to Fibber Magees."}
{"text":"Best place to come here for Brunch. $12 for bottomless mimosas including breakfast not a bad deal at all."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?? Disgusting toilet paper all over the floor. Sticky, smelly and visibly horrendous.  A great band was playing, but there was no dance floor, a bunch of tables right in the middle of the floor where obviously people are trying to dance.  So gross I lost my thirst, dare I ever eat the food.  Too bad, there is no other place for live music.   Amateur management on a Friday night.  However, our server was really nice.  Not her fault."}
{"text":"Went here one night last month while waiting for some friends and the fries were AWESOME!!! Service was great and the place was jumpin! I can't wait to go back on purpose for some of those fries!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick drink, great food, comfortable setting, etc. The pub is located in an easy to access area of old town Chandler. The service is always prompt. Last time we were there, just a few days ago, their bottled beer was a bit skunky (like it had been warm and then chilled and then gotten warm, and then they chilled it again). Other than that, the food was amazing, as always. We love bringing people here. Lots of fun things to look at on the walls. And the service is pretty standard."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for Brunch.  The patio was wonderful for people watching, the food was excellent and $9.95 bottles of Champagne definitely made for some free flowing Mimosas!"}
{"text":"Came here with my brother on Thanksgiving Eve and had a great time. Our server Erika was great. She always had a nice smile when she came by our table. The band was performing and they played a good selection of songs. All in all a great place to go."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the ambiance of Murphy's Law!  The food has been good and Irish!  It's a fun time!  They are not gluten friendly which is what I need these days.   We only go before or after peak times."}
{"text":"The best bar with entertainment in Downtown Chandler!  Chauncey, Shannon, and the boys are great! Try the Peanut Butter and Jelly shot! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"For March's International Supper Club UYE we choose Murphy's Law has the place to go to keep on with the Saint Patrick's theme.     The weather was nice so we opted for a high table out on the patio, and since we were there before 7pm we made it in time for the Happy Hour Prices, so that's win win!  After checking out the menu I went with Murphy's Loaded Fries, which was beer battered fires topped with Murphy's cheese sauce, bacon, sour cream, chipotle sauce & green onions. The chipotle sauce had a nice smoky flavor and the fries were cooked perfectly and could handle all the toppings without getting soggy.   Murphy's Law is a cool little pub in downtown Chandler, go check them out!"}
{"text":"Great food. Way better than I expected. The fish and chips were great. Service was good too. Now, if I could only convince my wife to come with me on Tuesdays for the fish and chips I'd be set."}
{"text":"We really loved this place, loved the decor, but considering the place was D.E.A.D. when we walked in... expected a little more life from the bartender. Never bought beer in a bar from a more lacking personality at an Irish bar in our lives... what happened to having a personality in the hospitality industry? Maybe they should hire someone from Ireland??   But overall, I will buy another beer from here, as will my friends, and we will tip as if we are in Ireland. 0."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for a drink and food.  The set up was fun and clean.  The food was really good.  We sat at the bar, not many others were there.  They had 3 bar tenders and several wait staff coming and going.  The bar was not that full and there was only a few other customers at the bar.  Took 10 min. Before anyone even acknowledge that we were there.  Not sure I'd go back.  Seemed like a fun place, to bad they didn't care about customers"}
{"text":"I have a special place in my heart for this place because it is where my wife and I had our first date.  Drinks and service have always been great and what I've had of the food is pretty good.  They had grilled wings on special one time and they were, to quote Will Ferrel as James Lipton, \"scrumtrulescent.\"  It has the feel of an old Irish pub which is unmatched in AZ."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick beverage and a snack. Saturday evening @6. Ordered the pretzel sticks and artichoke dip. Pub chips were served with the dip. They were amazing. Thin and crispy potato slices but so good. The cheese dipping sauce for the pretzel sticks was so good! We want to come  back for a burger and other food."}
{"text":"Nothing like a live band singing cover songs in a crowded Irish pub on a Saturday night.  Located in downtown Chandler, Murphys Law is the type of place everyone can enjoy.  There is so much going on inside: rows of empty Whiskey bottles, thousands of dollar bills personalized with a sharpy line the walls, live music, descent food, kool people of all ages, and more.  You can stand, sit, hang out at the bar, or even enjoy the weather in the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Another overhyped, overrated restaurant. Our entree order took 35 minutes to arrive. It's a corned beef sandwich and Shepherd's Pie. Actually, it wasn't a Shepherd's Pie. It was a beef pot pie with mashed potato and puff pastry topping. Authentic Shepherd's Pie does not have a pastry crust, only mashed potato. Murphy's serves a pot pie, not a Shepherd's Pie. Retrain your so-called chef to cook authentic Irish food and in timing tickets."}
{"text":"Sunday on the patio people watching.  Bottle of Champagne and OJ for $9.95.  Beats a Mimosa for $7.  Wish they had more patio seating, but we were able to grab one."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars, I would. I placed an order through door dash, and the menu was outdated, so the food I ordered was no longer available... I get that. The owner proceeded to tell the driver that was delivering my food, that he spoke with me and I was totally ok, with not getting half of my order... NOT THE CASE... He never spoke with me, and when my food arrived, I had payed a $6 delivery charge for a burger and fries. I called the location to address the issue, and the woman who answered the phone was extremely rude and seemed indifferent as to why I was upset. I asked for the manager, who told me \"a woman\" had called because the item She ordered was not on the menu and she was fine with just receiving the burger and mediocre fries. When I said that I never called about MY order, and that I was upset that HE said I had, he was completely disrespectful. Door dash resolved the problem as far as the charges but as far as the behavior of this owner... Unresolved...  Ps. My boyfriend who ordered the burger, is now sick. The worst service and apparently, food at this establishment"}
{"text":"Great place for a beer and a bite.  Our bartender Jessica was spot on in her suggestions.  I drove from Tempe and would gladly drive from Scottsdale, Tempe or Mesa to come here again."}
{"text":"This Was my first time here and will be the last time it took 30 minutes to get a table and 20 minutes to get any drinks and it was very loud and people were being rude I would not recommend to here"}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders.  The food is good and plentiful.  Try the PB&J shot you will thank me."}
{"text":"Irish Pubs are my second home, so this had a strong chance of being the best spot, but it lost a star due to how long it took to get the food order out.  The atmosphere is great, the bar is super long for plenty of space for people, and the TVs are huge, clear, and front/center. The people at the bar were also very friendly.  I ordered the Bangers and Mash, pretty simple and it turned out to be a solid meal but, it took 2 Quarters of Football to come out, and it was not busy at all.  Long time.  Otherwise the Bartenders were chill and accommodating, always refilling water, making chit chat, checking in on you, all the good things.  For watching sports, having a beer and kicken it, this is the spot. Just know if you come hungry, it might take awhile to get your food."}
{"text":"We loved the Fish & Chips with a iced tea  the serve was great really nice enjoying Downtown Chandler"}
{"text":"Returned for 3rd trip after receiving bad service on our previous visits. The Reuben quesadilla was really good and they have an excellent selection of beer on tap. Service was alot better this time. I'm really happy it worked out as all my friends love this place. Cheers"}
{"text":"My 73 year old mother ate lunch here on Saturday 4/7. She's currently in the hospital after being rushed to ER by ambulance since Sunday, extremely ill and not going home today . The lady she lunched with and split a hamburger with was in the ER last night diagnosed with salmonella. I called Mike M (manager) yesterday. His response \"how do you know it came from us?  I asked him if splitting a burger and both guests were terribly ill was a coincidence. No apology. No concern for other patrons. Beware!!"}
{"text":"Such great food! We went for the moms eat free Mother's Day special and our waitress was so very nice. Service was great and super fast. She didn't charge us for the cokes we ordered at the end which I thought was very sweet. I had the ABC burger - so so good! The fries are so crispy and crunchy I loved them so much. My only complaint would be the prices, some of the things are a little expensive but I believe you get your money's worth. The portions are great, flavors even better. 9/10 would revisit."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere here. We came on a Sunday night because the first place we wanted to drink at closed at 9. So I loved that they were open late. We sat up at the bar and had some local beers. The bar tenders were really attentive. On Sunday nights, they do karaoke. They do have specials on weekdays, just check their menu. We didn't eat so I'm not too sure what the food tastes like. This bar is located in downtown Chandler which is a really neat place to be. It's an older building that's was built in the early 1900's but still looks in great shape. This is a great bar to hang out at."}
{"text":"Hugh bar, staff very friendly, food was a little above average, beer could be colder Two entries and  4 beers $45. We liked it, plus this part of Chandler offers half dozen choices just a few minutes walking apart"}
{"text":"I'm updating this review to give them a second chance at earning my business and I'll update the review upon a return trip.  My original review was on an extremely busy day and maybe I was being unfair in my expectations for service.  Though I don't think that's the case I'm willing to give it another go at a more normal time.   I still encourage you to clarify price with the bartender's before ordering, especially if you're looking to take advantage of happy hour."}
{"text":"I have been living in Arizona now for just over 3 months and Murphy's has been mine and my family's go to, hang out spot since we found it back in February. We especially love coming in for the fish and chips on Wednesday's as well as for the live music and the upbeat vibe on the weekends. Last week was different though and we played our usual busy week down a bit and came in on Sunday instead. My husband had seen a post about a free mothers Day meal for any mother that came into Murphy's on Sunday and we decided that it would be a perfect day to bring my mother in to treat her to a nice brunch. We figured we could tackle a few hours out of the house considering it was free and it would be her last Mother's Day with us. My mother had been nearing the end of her battle with pancreatic cancer and was sent home from the Cancer Treatment Center last Wednesday to pass at home when that time decided to arrive. Little did we know that our brunch at Murphy's would be our very last meal and tine together as a family ever again . I want to thank you guys for doing this small gesture towards Mother's on this day because for me and my brother we get to keep this memory and cherish it forever! I also have to say that the two girls you had working last Sunday are few and far between. When we arrived, almost every single table was full ! There were no tables that worked to fit the wheelchair along with the 4 other people in our group but Shannon greeted us with the most energetic presence and made us feel right at home, instead of feeling like a burden. She immediately cleaned off a dirty table and came right back over to get us taken care of with drinks and anything else we needed. Sara behind the bar was just as cheerful and had such a great charisma. She was just as quick to offer a smile and a cheerful helping hand to us along with all of her other bar customers. I do not know how these two young ladies handled the amount of people at Murphy's last Sunday all on their own, but they did, and all while giving each and every table the exact same treatment and not missing a single beat when most wait staff would have surely given up. It's not often that you go out to eat these days and leave feeling like you want to cry but in a really good way. Your restaurant is extremely lucky to have those girls so do not lose them! Seeing my mother just beaming with happiness in a time of such sorrow was what that day was all about . I have been dealing with heaps of calls and texts on top of funeral arrangements this past week and keep hearing this voice inside telling me to applaud you guys for a job not just well done but for giving me the best Mother's Day to remember my mother by and giving her a day to celebrate as her last. I would like to bring Shannon and Sara a little gift and will be coming by sometime in the next week or so after family and friends head back home . In the mean time please give them a big hug for me and of course one from Maw-Maw! Thank you Murphy's Law for the free meal but most of all the best last day ever with my mom on Mothers Day! Yours Truly, Lindsey Stein"}
{"text":"Murphy's Law used to be the place to go in Downtown Chandler, but if it wasn't for all the successful businesses surrounding it, I think they would be struggling.  I like the spirit of being authentic as a pub, but authentic & rundown are different things. And don't even get me started on having live music! The size of the bar & the acoustics aren't right for loud music.  It's ruins the essence of a pub, which is a place to eat & drink & talk & linger.    We used to go there a lot back in the day (pre name change then name change back), but think there are better options now in Chandler.   I'm not slamming Murphy's Law, I'm hoping they will return to their former glory."}
{"text":"This is a great place for football Sunday! They are very accommodating on seating so you can watch your game.  If you go, make sure you ask for Sapphire! She's always so much fun and really adds to our Sunday Funday!  She's always ready with our drinks and gets our tabs right every time (even if we cant) - :)  The only reason for 4 out of 5 is I wish they had more menu options for the brunch!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. The staff was more involved with talking to each other than helping customers.  15  minutes to get a drink order another 15 to take food order. During this time the 2 waitresses couldn't stop talking to the bartender.  21 total people in the restaurant.  Not a good staff. Very poor."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the very best smoked wings I've ever had. Other food I have tried has been very good and I'm told the corned beef is excellent but others who have tried. It is a Seahawks bar during football season but thats the only negative for me."}
{"text":"Stopped here with some friends on a busy Saturday night. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the fun, lively environment. The drinks were great and we loved the live music. It was definitely crowded, but we didn't care since we weren't trying to get up and dance. Our bartender was great; very attentive to us and the other customers at the bar. And he made great drink recommendations! It was funny to witness the female bartender getting a little annoyed at how attentive he was haha. We had fun and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Took around 30 minutes or more to get our drinks every time we ordered with. zero apologies.  Pours were very very week as well.   Wasn't even crowded but they are just bush league.  Update:   There was just a crazy fight at the bar.   Glasses flying etc...   Nice !"}
{"text":"The food is always great! However the service is not quite up to par. I come in here about twice a month because the wings are great! Yesterday, my waitress delivered my meal very promptly, but that was the only time I saw her. And I was there for about 45 mins. She never once asked if I or anyone at my table needed a refill on our drinks. Once we were done eating, someone at our table had to go in the back, by the kitchen door to get our waitress. Once the waitress brought our check, it was clear that she had an attitude with us. We asked for boxes & cups to go & she hastily put them on our table. We still left her a $5 tip. But the service wasn't worth 5 cents!"}
{"text":"Great service-great drinks-amazing wings and the best food there is the \"cloudy day\" sandwich! 10/10"}
{"text":"What a fun Irish pub if you're looking to stop for a drink.  We were starving and the waits were extended downtown on a Saturday night so we decided to try the food here.  Our dishes were filling and tasted ok.  Definitely not a dinner destination place by plan however not bad."}
{"text":"I've been coming in for the last year to see my favorite server and for the amazing fish and chips. The last few weeks we haven't seen her and we even made a special trip on the weekend to see if she was working. Maybe she quit or got fired? Either way food and drinks are great but their service has gone down in the last few weeks. Hopefully she's on vacation and will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have gone to a few Irish pubs. This was a really great experience. Had an Irish Pub burger (corned beef and ground beef mixed, very good). My son had the shepherds pie, which I sampled and it was excellent. We also had the artichoke dip as an appetizer because he soup wasn't ready for the day (because it is made fresh from scratch). I will return for sure."}
{"text":"We love visiting Irish Pubs.  When we saw this place right down the road from a get together we were having at SanTan Brewing Co., we knew we had to come back. We returned at lunch the very next day.  We loved the Irish food items on the menu.  All three of us ended up with Shepherd's Pie.  It was different than the other Shepherd's Pie we had eaten but absolutely huge and delicious.  I would have loved to have tried the corned beef and cabbage sliders but that has to be another day.  This is a great place and hope to return to taste test a few more items.  Service was good"}
{"text":"I've been here many times & have always been satisfied.  The food is good & the Irish Nachos are  awesome!!   Tonight I sat at the bar as usual & had 2 beers.  My bill was $14.73.... I paid w/ a $20 bill. I got $5 back. Really??   Then I go to the restroom & come back to my beer (beer still there so they weren't sure that I was gone) but my $5 was gone. The bartender had put it in the tip jar. I let the bartender know what happened.... he said he'd get me my 27cents as he walked away. it's not about the 27 cents. Not going back."}
{"text":"This is not just a pub. This place has amazing breakfast and thier jameson smoked wings are some of the best wing ive ever had! The bartenders and servers are phenomenal. I cannot recommend this establishment enough."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here, which was good but not great. French Toast was average, my wife enjoyed her egg sandwich. Enjoyed the coffee, didn't try and alcohol on this trip."}
{"text":"The fish is outstanding, the French fries mixed (my wife thought they were tough, I was fine). The service, however, was poor. Friendly, cheerful, when they were around. But...had to get our own silverware, had to wait at the front to ask for ketchup, had to go to the desk to pay. Admittedly a Friday evening, but still."}
{"text":"I've recently moved to the area and stumbled across this pub a few weeks ago and have been back many times. I would consider myself a professional chicken strip eater having consumed 1,000's of strips and I'd put the the chicken strips at Murphy's Law at the very top."}
{"text":"I travel to Chandler once a month for a week.  I have been doing this for 3 years now.  Every time I arrive,  I come here.    Their Jamison wings are off the chart.  Their custom service is outstanding.  Their beer selection is by far the best.  Most importantly,  they WANT you to come back and, when you do, you feel it.  Great place! Great staff!  Great times!!"}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but when I step through a doorway and feel like I crossed a international border, or a dateline, or just stepped back into a pub in Dublin, I know it is going to be a good day!   A friend and I were headed to a local well-known brewery for a bite & a beer. As we started to pass Murphy's Law, she asked if I had ever been in there. My honest answer was \"no.\" So, the two of us, being adventuresome and also having been to Ireland together a few years ago (and desperately wanting to go again), made a sharp left and crossed the pond. Yes, it definitely felt as if we had stepped back into a pub that we drank in while we were in Ireland - both in Dublin & Galway.   I had a Guinness Peach (a whole new experience, but I actually like it). Being partial to  Guinness, I thought \"Ok, so here is where this AZ desert bar is going to fall off the cliff trying to pretend to be Irish.\" But no, it actually was quite good and I would drink it again. Plain old Guinness be damned!   A little touch of Dublin pubs, a little feel of Irish culture. Worth the visit, if you have shamrocks in your soul instead of scorpions!."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant and Bar with good food and great atmosphere.  The Sunday brunch is worth a visit.  Great Mamosas!  Great selection of beers both on tap and in the bottle.  The food is spectacular.  Good service as well."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place after waiting for a beer for 25 min. The server was very sweet and the only reason we waited for so long. The bartender was ditzing around and only taking care of her bar customers. I guy walked up to the bar and was served his beer within minutes while we sat and watched and waited. I approached the manager on the way out the door and let him know the wait was unacceptable. His response was oh I'm sorry. Thats it. My husband and I worked in the service industry for 6-10+ years and this was absolutely unacceptable. The bartender (short bob cut black or dark brown hair) is not a team player and should not be behind the bar. I have been to this location other times and had a great experience. This ruined it for me and is the first time we have ever walked out of a restaurant in our lives."}
{"text":"Stop in there today it was busy. Sat at a table for 15 min no one even acknowledged us moved to the bar still no service, flagged down server walking by asked for service said they would tell bartender. Finally she came down. Ordered drink and food never saw her again 45 minutes later asked different server about order told kitchen backed up . Asked for the bill they brought it. No explanation or apology. Service rated an F."}
{"text":"DO NOT SUPPORT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!  11 of my friends and family scheduled dinner at this establishment Wednesday March 9. Upon arrival and locating seating, after a few minutes Sapphire the waiter stopped and asked if we were all eating? That was a weird question to ask and should have been a sign, for what was yet to come.  She arrived with a few menus and said you will need to share, we don't have enough menus for all of you. The special on Wednesday is buy a fish and chips get one free.  In the lower right hand corner of the special along with the tv screens and the LARGE advertising board out in the sidewalk, it says \" Every Wednesday buy one order of our amazing fish & chips receive the second equal or lesser value order FREE!  We confirmed with Sapphire, that this means anything on the menu, she confirmed with her manager on duty \"Amber\" Sapphire returned to the group and said \" the manager is agreeing to allow you to buy one fish and chips, and buy anything of equal or lesser value, this one time only, and that all the cards will be pulled and reprinted, because it is for fish and chips not.  Mind you there is only 1 order of fish and chips on the menu..........We all placed our orders.  We waited for ever for our food to arrive, once the food started to arrive, everyone's meal, but my meal showed up at the table.  I waited and waited, all of a sudden I saw Sapphire speaking with a group of employees, you could tell it was a heated discussion, a few minutes later Sapphire walked over to the table and said \" The General Manager has over trumped the manager who agreed that you could order something other then fish n chips, therefore you will need to pay full price for you meals.\"   I indicated that was wrong, and also said, don't bring my meal.\" Everyone was practically done eating already, and I still had no food. Two minutes late the so called GM Scott, rolled over to the table, and started in by saying that we didn't under stand the special, as he was reading the card, he was covering up the lower right hand corner and arguing with us.  When my husband asked for the card from Scott, he reluctantly gave it to him, my husband proceeded to read once again fine print, Scott said \" You didn't understand what your readying\".  Sapphire proceeded to deliver my meal, mind you everyone else was done eating already! I told her \"I didn't want it I wasn't paying for it take it away.\"  She left it at the table and walked away. She went to the GM Scott and advised him of what I said.  He came over and said you will be paying for this meal, I said hell no, it arrived when the entire table is done eating, and instead cook me up a fish and chips meal, and add a to go box, so that we get the free meal, At which time he said \" the fish and chips is for dine in only, no  to go boxes for the meals.\"  Wow Scott your now making up things, where does it say this?   Our group was small compared to other weekly gatherings.  Murphy's Law just lost a huge repeat customer, along with all the other contacts our group has.   The best thing that Murphy's Law owner can do at this time is release the current Managment team and get some honest professional people who know what customer service is all about.    Scott should have spoken to the manager instead of making an A@@ out of himself and the establishment.   Sapphire lost out big time on receiving the tips this night, she can blame her GM!"}
{"text":"Tried this neat little spot for lunch. Really nice location and atmosphere. Had the lunch size Sheppard's pie. Have to say it was one of the best I have ever had. It had a pastry  puff baked on top. Service was excellent. Price was a bit on expensive side for lunch. But quality was outstanding. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Murphy's Law was bought in Jan 2016. They no longer honor any of the discount cards. They will be coming out with a new menu and you know what that means... higher prices.  Let's see what new ownership can do.  Hopefully service picks up. They did retain the previous chef which was a good move. They need to encourage regulars to return by providing a discount program not by cutting them out. It's a nice place hopefully they do much better than previous management that played games with advertisement and discounts.  Giving them a 3 star for starters because they retained The previous  chef and one of the better bartenders.  They continue to have excellent fish and philly cheesesteak... the chef is very good."}
{"text":"If I could give no star I would.. where do I begin... Server doesn't know what don Julio is.... Just to start... Goes even further down hill from there... Hire better train better management you fucking douche bags."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection and excellent grub. The  Jameson wings are phenomenal and Fish and chip are delicious. Staff was getting rocked but kept things moving and we're courteous and helpful."}
{"text":"There's a reason this is always one of the least populated restaurant/bars in downtown Chandler. Hideous crowd and even worse staff. They always close early. The bouncers are hyped up on machismo and arrogance. There are so many better places just steps away. Don't waste your time. Hit San Tan Brewery, Bourbon Jacks or ANYWHERE else. Trust me."}
{"text":"Been here twice,  first time I wasn't impressed with their food but decided to try one more time and it was a totally different experience. I ordered the shepherds pie and it was very tasty and different from others I have tried, it came topped with a puffed pastry with mustard butter and it was very good. My husband ordered fish and chips and he thought they were good Our server was a very nice and pleasant  This place is always busy it has live music Friday and Saturday and a Saturday and Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Real short review.  Do not under any circumstances order the \"Irish Sliders\".  It's basically chopped up corned beef with chopped up cabbage piled onto a roll.  Not tasty.  Very dry."}
{"text":"Murphy's law- food took too long to get. Drinks were sub par. Environment was cool. Love the dollar wall. Took forever to get service with like 8 empty tables. Understaffed clearly. Don't come here if you're starving. Because if there's two people here already. You're food will get to you in a couple hours.  The Shepard's pie was disappointing and the artichoke dip was OK.  The pot the pie came in was super cool. No desert menu :( lot of old school rock music, which was cool if that's your thing )"}
{"text":"Came here for a family reunion for the first time and it was a great time. Fun atmosphere, friendly staff and high energy from the band. Most notably, however, was my experience after I left.  I LOVE French bulldogs, so they just so happen to have very cool shirts with both beer AND frenchies on them. My boyfriend surprised me with a shirt later in the night. Unfortunately we didn't notice the glitter on the girls shirt til I unrolled (glitter boo hiss). The guy's shirt didn't have glitter, so we went to see if I could exchange the shirt I had for a male small. The guy that helped us was friendly and easygoing (sry I can't remember his name!). He said they didn't have any in stock, but they could mail me a small when they did. We were surprised and, honestly, a little skeptical. They're offering to mail a shirt to San Diego? Would we hear from them again or simply be out $20 bucks?  We took a chance, and left our info. About two weeks later, I got an email from the Marketing Director Kami saying I could pick up my shirt. When I explained the situation, she said she could get it in the mail right away. It turned out, however, they didn't have any smalls and weren't expecting too. I was a little bummed, but it wasn't a big deal. I asked for a size XL, figuring my dad would like the shirt.  I didn't hear back, and so I week late I checked in with Kami to see if she had got my last email. A day later, I got a package in the mail. It was TWO guy shirts- a M and XL. Shoutout to Kami and the Murphy's Law Pub Staff for being so awesome. Really appreciate the extra time and energy you guys took to send a visitor with a frenchie obsession a shirt- we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Singing Sundays is always a fun time. The bartenders take care of you, the singing is great, and everyone is having a damn good time singing along. I recommend stopping by sone time and getting your groove on."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with hubby, daughter and our best friends and their daughter.  They had a live music performer.  It was very loud but good.  It was early but crowded.  The unfortunate part is we had an incident with an overzealous inebriated individual. When we informed our waitress, Shannon, she immediately got the manager. I believe his name was Scott (and I am so sorry if it is incorrect.) Regardless the guest were asked to vacate. Again the manager was extremely helpful and apologetic.  I just wanted the staff to know that we truly appreciated their professional manner and can't thank them enough."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite bar in downtown chandler! Best environment and amazing \"Jameson wings\" which were recommended by the bartender Stee. He's the best staff member behind the bar in my opinion very knowledgeable about his craft beers and made us the best shots I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Went in for a few beers. Zac and Kristina were my bartenders, they were very friendly and made me feel welcome on a busy night. Had the pretzels, they were delicious. Lots of great beers on tap."}
{"text":"I have never had worse service in MY LIFE! we last night (wednesday) the bar was not busy. we were never offered drinks, the waitress (young blonde- was very unfriendly, unpersonable and really rude & snooty) After messing up our order, and our drinks, multiple times we were just about ready to walk out. If we were thirsty- we had to ask the poor bartender (who was helpful) the wings were soggy. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE UNLESS THEY GET ALL NEW STAFF THAT ACTUALLY WAITS ON TABLES. I WAS READY TO GO IN THE BACK & MAKE MY OWN DRINKS, THEY PROB WOULDNT HAVE EVEN NOTICED!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to go to Murphy's law for breakfast. Usually good service and breakfast. Arrived at 10:35 on a Sunday. About 5 tables of people , 12 in total.  1 server and 2 guys working the bar. Took until 10:55 to even place order. Order was coffee and American breakfast. Since I have been here I have seen customers get their coffee refilled twice and at 11:07, still have need received my first cup. WTF ! Guys at the bar are obvious talking about NASCAR and Basketball.  Just received coffee at 11:09, 34 minutes after I got here !!! Got breakfast at 11:11. Hash Browns are cold and had to ask for silverware. Sever was friendly and she did apologize, but she should have asked for help. Murphy's not high on my list anymore considering the choices available now in Downtown Chandler. Finally received bill. If I was them, I would have given me coffee for free. Tell service staff they have the power to make positive customer decisions !!"}
{"text":"Service sucked but we kind expected that.  The pretzels were yummy, the fries were pretty good, the chips and salsa sucked, I'm pretty sure they just use canned salsa but they do absolutely nothing to it, to make it better, soo not even worth the $2 on happy hour."}
{"text":"Love the new staff and possibly, unsure if mgmt changed but bar staff sure did several months ago. Very attentive,  friendly,  detail oriented and food quality has improved! One of our favorite spots within walking distance"}
{"text":"Very popular place in Chandler. We went on a Sunday night and the place was packed. Many beer choices, pub ambiance, and live band playing. We only had drinks no food. On that Saturday night, It looked like the customers where young adult just enjoying rock n roll.  If we ever go back to Chandler, we will return to this pub because it is one of a kind in this quiet town."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar so my review may be a bit biased.  Just wanted to make that clear up front... :-) I have been coming to Murphy's since Roger first opened it and it has seen some ups and downs (one time the service was so bad we left) but Roger has made a comeback with this place and has come back stronger.  The service personnel are friendly and the food is fantastic.  I highly recommend the fish and chips or the shepherds pie.  If you are willing to try something different for your fish and chips, have the Murphy's chips, they are thick cut potato chips made right there in the bar and are a delicious alternative.  The breakfast is likewise a hit, with the corned beef hash and the Irish breakfast being the stand outs. Be aware that the bar does get rowdy and loud on weekend evenings once the band fires up so if that's not your thing make sure your visit is early in the evening or for lunch.  But if a fun crowd and a great band is what you want you can't beat this place after 9 on a weekend.  And I didn't even mention the outstanding selection of draft beers with a variety of domestic, import and microbrews on tap."}
{"text":"Fish n Chips still very good. However the continued use of Yankee Candles is rough to endure while eating."}
{"text":"Someone decided it would be a good idea to light waaaaaayyyyyyy too many scented candles.  It's all you can smell and it's terrible.  Imagine trying eat/drink in a Yankee Candle shop...not something you'd do.  I can't imagine the thought process that arrived at deciding having scented candles in a bar was a good idea, but I would strongly suggest rethinking the idea is in order.  Food and beer were ok but as long as the candles are there, I won't be."}
{"text":"Wow! My husband and I went to the San tan brewery for the first time since moving here from Denver. Awesome service. Decided to check out the Irish pub on the way back to the car for a night cap... Walked in and sat down at the bar. I left to go the ladies room and as I returned I noticed nobody greeted my husband. The bar tender at the time was too busy trying to hit on a girl at the bar. 10 minutes later we walked out. At least a average Irish pub would flip you off! Not one response. Enough said!"}
