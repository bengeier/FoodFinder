{"text":"Decent place to meet up with friends to play some board games. The area is a bit eerie, with the silhouette of the cathedral at the end of a very quiet street. 

Didn't try the food, but the drinks were alright- nothing spectacular. Our friends did like the gelato! I would recommend getting a drink, because it helps you buy your way into a play all night deal. 

HEADS UP: the 10% off Yelp check in discount is no longer being accepted. 

The game selection is pretty good, and we played a few games that our friends introduced us to. We would have liked it if the person working there could suggest new games that we haven't heard of or played before."}
{"text":"Store Rep was good at recommending games, my hot beverage was good. Thought the place would be more bigger. Would go again during the day"}
{"text":"Came here on their grand opening. 

The place is in a seemingly residential neighbourhood and the other stores are not open yet.  In fact, the neighbourhood is still pretty much a construction zone.  When we went, it was the only place open actually. 

The place is quite small with a few game playing tables, a wall full of games and a small cafe area. 

There are a wide variety of caffeinated beverages, cakes and gelato.  I appreciate the fact that despite being in a highly populated Asian area, they don't serve bubble tea (like almost all drink places in the area) but it actually serves coffee and tea like the places downtown.  

Also, talking to the owner, he utilizes an Italian company midtown as the supplier for their gelato and the ingredients come direct from Italy apparently. The cakes are apparently from Dufflet. 

We tried their gelato which was delicious, hot chocolate and hot apple cider.  The drinks were good. 

In terms of the games, they have all the typical games (Settlers, Dominion, Ghost Blitz, Agricola, etc etc) and the owner is quite knowledgeable and walks around teaching customers how to play new games.  Also, what I appreciated was that they sell games there as well at the same price point as 401 Games.  

Because it was the grand opening, buying one beverage allows for unlimited play time with any board games.  I think in their first month there is a 10% off but from what I saw on their menu I think it's $8 for unlimited play and 1 free drink.  

Overall, I liked Chit Chat Play Board Game Cafe.  The place is small but cozy.   I do think that they need more variety of snacks but it was only their grand opening so perhaps there will be more. I can definitely see myself coming back to either buy new board games or trying some out."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, knowledgeable and friendly staff. Great layout, organized and tidy. The food is quite pricey. Other than that I like going there, it's quaint."}
{"text":"Chit Chat Play, referred to as CCPC by my friends and I, is a small place to meet up with friends for a boardgame (or 5...) and cafe drink/snack. I've been here a few times after work during the week, and the cafe is pretty quiet. I've also been here a couple times with larger parties (once with 13) during the weekend. 

Price:
During the weekdays, unlimited play w/ a drink (of $3.25 value) is just shy of $10 after taxes. On weekends, that price goes up by about a dollar or 2. With around 200 games available, you can definitely get your money's worth.

Service:
Jaro (the owner) and staff are friendly and knowledgeable about most of their games, and are always available for game tips/help! If there's a game you particularly liked, you can buy it right away if they have it available! If it's not available, they can order it for you. Game prices are comparable to (if not sometimes better than) Great Boardgames and Board Game Bliss. (Sometimes I wonder if BGB is actually affiliated with CCPC...hrmmm)

Menu:
There's an assortment of drinks, both caffeinated and non-caffeinated, in hot and cold forms -- teas, lattes, Italian soda, Apple cider. There's also a small section of snacks including gelato and waffles. Offering a small selection of paninis could probably help boost sales ;-)"}
{"text":"Berry waffle gelato was great. Our table was a bit wobbly and the washroom could have been cleaner. Bit pricey for weekend as there is $10 charge on top of bill, but it is the only board game cafe in the general area. Overall quaint cafe."}
{"text":"Walked in and was packed, put my name on a list and was told they weren't sure of availability. Space opened up 15 minutes later. Great host, great coffee, great selection of games, but just okay food. That's the only thing stopping it from being a complete 5 is food and space."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times. The coffee is pretty good but find the service fairly poor. 
Ive mainly been here with the kids for coffee/gelato and a bit of games but have had sub par experiences every time (been here about 5 times). One time the staff forgot about my drink and went back to playong board game with other staffers, when I asked for my drink there wasnt even an acknowledgment for forgetting. He just got up and gave me my drink as if nothing happened. We were excited at first with the prospect of a good coffee house by our place, but we left unsatisfied everytime with the service. Although this place is 5 mins away, we take the 15 min walk to starbucks now for our after meal coffee."}
{"text":"A tiny little board game store hidden in the neighbourhood. The board game selection is huge in comparison to the size of the store itself - a whole wall of games for a space with maybe 6-7 tables. 

A few tables are very nicely decorated - hand painted as the game board for ticket to ride/pandemic etc. A very nice touch! 

However, other than the great selection of games, everything else falls short of other board game places. The sitting fee alone is $10 (or more on weekends) which is the most out of any place I've been to.  It does include a drink of up to $3.25, which is barely anything on their menu.  Drinks and food are mediocre at best.

Overall, this place is good for a lazy afternoon when you don't feel like driving any further for board games, but if there's a wait it wouldn't be worth it for me."}
{"text":"The cutest place. Seriously. 

Great service, lots of games and yummy food - focusing on sweets (gelato, waffles, etc). It is a bit pricier than usual places but I think it's worth it. 

Fin."}
{"text":"I brought 8 kids here to play some board games as part of a church event. We booked a table ahead of time. 
Once we got there we got seated right away. Only 1 worker there but he was super friendly and even helped me explain some of the games to the kids.
We did not have any trouble finding any games suitable for kids under age 14. They all enjoyed their time here. 
There were non-caffeinated drink options available like smoothies and sodas. Had their passion fruit soda, it was good. They have gelato as well but no food available. They also have teas that come with a  timer for optimal steeping time which I thought was interesting... 
During the time here I saw maybe 2 other groups come in. 
Price is $12 for all you can play. Includes a drink less than $3.25. You could add extra money to get something bigger. 
I liked it here cuz it wasn't too crowded and pretty quiet."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place exists.

Reasonably priced flat rate per person for as many hours as you want. Chit-chat cafe's also got a massive collection of different board games. They've pretty much got at least one copy of every popular and popular-ish board game including many others I couldn't even at popular board game cafe's downtown such as Castle Board Game Cafe which is about 3 times the size but maybe half the selection of games Chit Chat Cafe boasts.

The coffee is surprisingly good and as well the gelato that they also had.

The staff is super friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about all the board games. 

The only negative about this place is the size. There are only a handful of tables available and my group and I have found ourselves out of luck several nights. The weekends really are a gamble. This can be seen as both a negative and positive but the tables CAN be reserved. It can be a negative because I often see the tables go empty for at least an hour before the people reserving them show up.

Overall this place is a fantastic change to all of Markham's countless bubble tea joints and is a strong competitor to board game cafes downtown (especially when Snakes is so far and always full), which is why I say I'm so glad this place exists."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the selection they have for such an intimate space! It is a bit pricey, so staying longer you can definitely get your money's worth! 

Tried their smoothies and gelato. Smoothies were alright. Like something you could make at home. Gelato was smooth but not amazing. Very average gelato.

Would come back for games! Close by, convenient, and cozy. I like how their tables aren't just regular tables and have slots for game play. 

Very pretty street but cafe is Hard to find. So drive slow! The outside of the store looks like every other store on the street. You can park right in front of it, so that's convenient. 

Make reservations in case!!"}
{"text":"A tiny little place in Cathedraltown with a decent selection of board games and selection of gelato and coffee. For board games in the Richmond Hill/Markham area, this is a go-to location for me. Unfortunately due to its size and their policy of unlimited stay, their tables can fill up and it becomes pointless to wait-be sure to call in and make a reservation! Further, make sure to clarify whether they actually have a table to reserve for you, or if they're putting you on the waitlist. If you are there with a table maximizing your unlimited play, I recommend having some common courtesy to be flexible with moving to a smaller/different table to fit other groups. If you're done playing and just want to finish up your snacks and drinks and chat, look out for waiting groups that may be eyeing your table desperately. 

I recommend the affogato, and I've seen their waffles being quite popular as well. The drink and unlimited play combo deal is a great choice to sustain you through hours of board games. 

In terms of games, I recommend asking for a recommendation that will suit your group's interests, and so you can get a quick overview of how to play the game.

They also have a variety of games available for sale at reasonable prices-convenient if you've tried something out and want to take it home right away!"}
{"text":"LOVE the fact that I no longer have to commute downtown to enjoy some games and coffee with my friends. They have an extensive coffee menu, gourmet gelatos (my friend got a tomato & basil which apparently was pretty good!), and a decent collection of board games. Staff and owner are also extremely friendly and are very well-versed in the rules of the games they offer. They're also bilingual and can help in both Cantonese and English! They also do latte art! I also a girl who got a really cute bear for her drink. (Note to self: order cappucino just for latte art)

I would recommend visiting on weekdays instead of weekends though. They were fairly full when my friends and I arrived around 9:30-10pm ish. We were lucky that there was one table left and the owner was quick to call everyone on the waitlist before letting us go in for the steal ;). 

Essentially $8 for a drink and endless laughs and fun with your friends is totally worth it in my eyes. Not to mention I'm more likely to get a seat here than Snakes and Lattes! Also don't forget to check in on Yelp! 10% off food/ drink =)"}
{"text":"Yes! Chit Chat Play! Very impressed with this place now that I finally got a table! Came for the second time as I couldn't get a table the first time, and got really lucky on a Sunday night! Seems to busy all the time, so they recommend that you call ahead to see if there's an available table. If there is, they will hold it for you for 30 min. 

Very fairly priced for unlimited play between $8-10, including a drink @ $3.25. Essentially you get a discount of $3.25 from your total bill. Don't forget to check in as you get 10% off as well!

Came from work so was quite hungry. A little disappointed that they didn't have any food, but the waffles and apply pie were AMAZING! $11.50 for the waffles and $7.50 for the pie was quite worth it as they came with gelato! They did say on their website that sandwiches were coming soon, so hopefully they get that started!

Had a fun time with the board games and the owner & staff were super nice and helpful. Very knowledgeable and friendly, they explained the board games you didn't understand, and always walked by to make sure everything was fine! The board game wall was beautifully organized and had a wide variety to choose from! Even sold new copies of games if you really enjoyed it!

An amazing little cafe that I would easily give 4.5 stars. Would get a perfect review with more food/snack options and more seats, but the smaller space and unlimited playtime makes sitting and playing games more fun!"}
{"text":"The drinks are not good and pricey...their cakes are store bought because I saw the delivery cake truck dropping by for delivery. Mostly teenagers with nowhere to go in the neighborhood so they resort to this place. Not recommended for age over 20s since it's a kiddie hangout. You see since my kids like this place I will still give it a 3 stars. Also they do make my neighborhood seem more lively but that's about it"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The owner was so helpful and sweet. It was my hubby and me with our 7 month old. We wanted to get some coffee and some fun time. We played a game of two players which was fun and quick. A place we will look forward to go in the future too. Unique concept!! And the affagato with hazelnut gelato was delicious!"}
{"text":"Loved the huge selection of games and personally found a new favourite with the anomia game. Very cozy so get here early in the night if you're coming with a big group of people. The drinks are all quite yummy, and the $8/$10 fee that includes a $3.25 drink credit is worth it I'd say if you're staying for a while."}
{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy your personal favourite games and try out new ones. The environment is really cute and cozy. There are about six tables so it'll be best to make a reservation. I thought that the noise would be distracting but once you get immersed in your own games, you can barely notice everyone else. 

The workers were very friendly and helpful to my friends and I. If you ask, they'll give recommendations for good games to play based on your group size. Don't hesitate to try out new games because you don't have to read the game rules! They are familiar with most, if not all, of the games that they have and are happy to explain the rules.

I love the concept of this cafe. Their board game selection is huge and it's awesome that they sell some of the games as well. My only complaint is the latte art that I received but other than that, great experience. I will be back for sure! 

Games that I recommend: Spyfall, Ghost Blitz, Cash N Guns"}
{"text":"Went in around 7pm on a Thursday, ordered a latte and hot chocolate along with the fee to play. Came up to 24 dollars. Only one person was working and it was only us (2 people) and another group of 3. We asked thr guy behind the counter for a good game to play, he reccomended Patch Work. We took the game and played a few hands of Monopoly Go. My hot chocolate tasted bland, like it was a powder mixed with lukewarm water. The lattee with caramel was just horrible. It took him about 30-40 minutes to make our drinks. When he came by to give us our drinks I asked him if he could explain patchwork to us, he told us he would be right back and came up to us an hour later by which we put away the game. Mind you at this point it was just us at the place. The game selection sucks, aside from on game of monopoly all other games were unheard of. The service was horrendous. Will not be going back again."}
{"text":"if you're looking to hang out and play board games in Markham this place is pretty good. They've got a good selection of games and its very cozy. However, because it is smaller it does fill up pretty quick. The sitting fee and the drinks were a bit pricey if you compare it to snakes and lattes/lagers. I would recommend you pre-book your table ahead of time, otherwise risk not getting a seat since the place seats no more than 30 people."}
{"text":"This spot was a great! Well thought out and loved. 
The owner was the Gem though, informative, and passionate about board games and he's clients."}
{"text":"4 stars for concept; 2 stars for food. 

- I like the small cozy space, large selection of board games, custom made tables
- (La Rocca) Red velvet cake was rock hard, dry and days-old stale. Maybe my fault for taking the last slice but please don't serve something that isn't fresh. 
- Flat white was strong; lacked the smooth milky layer.

Recommend to make reservations. Full house on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the game selection at Chit Chat Play, I liked how someone was there to explain the rules of each game which saves time rummaging through an instruction booklet and potentially missing a few rules. Their boardgames are also very reasonably priced to purchase compared to where I normally go. However, they don't have an online site so you would need to call them for pricing and availability. 

Oh yeah, the matcha tea latte and Gelato was great too =)"}
{"text":"Finally, I don't have to go downtown for a board game cafe anymore!

I came here with a reservation on a Saturday at 5:30pm. No trouble finding parking at the lot behind the store - plenty of spots!

Although the place was smaller than I expected, the collection of board games was impressive. Since I came on the weekend, it was $10 unlimited play with a drink included (up to $3.25). I ordered a hazelnut latte, while my friends got the apple cider, cappuccino, earl grey tea, and peach lychee tea. My latte was quite small and I finished it way too fast :( My friend's lemon and hazelnut gelato was delicious (the hazelnut one tasted exactly like Bueno bars! YUM). Not a big food selection other than gelato and waffles though so make sure to eat beforehand if you'll be spending a long time here. 

Overall, nice atmosphere, friendly staff and good service! I will be back."}
{"text":"VERY impressed with this place. The only other uptown board game cafe is 

They have an extensive menu of coffee drinks and a small selection of gelato.
Their collection of board games is MUCH bigger than Utopia but not as large as S&L (expectedly)

Staff are extremely friendly and know how to play many of the games. They also suggested new ones for us - always fun to learn new games :) They also sell a lot of board games if you happen to like the one you're playing :) 

Chit-chat has a $6 sitting fee or $8 + 1 drink - not bad considering some places are $2 per hour! 

I would recommend making a reservation if you are planning to come here in the evenings (especially weekends!). This places gets PACKED."}
{"text":"I love neighbourhood cafes. And I seriously love neighbourhood cafes that also has a wall of board games. Man, I wish I live in this hood. It's literally right in the middle of Cathedral Town. 

You walk in and the space is not very big. There's about 7 or 8 tables. You can order from a selection of teas, coffees, gelato and desserts. The selections were surprisingly plentiful for a board game cafe. I got the Earl Grey Cream and it was delicious. I can't recall the price of the tea but it was cheaper than Starbucks yet high quality. The Belgian waffle took about 20 minutes before it arrived but it was delicious and served with two scoops of gelato. Mmmmm mmmm! 

The place was busy with all the tables filled when we were there on a Friday night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. If you pay $10, you can sit and play any of the board games they have available and they sure have a LOT. All the popular ones I've heard of, plus dozens more I've never heard of were all stacked in the back wall. You can ask the staff to teach you how to play the game if you don't already know how and they really take the time to explain and demo it for you. 

By 12:30 am, we were sleepy and decided to head home. (And because I lost a game of Settlers and didn't want to risk a repeat) The place was still buzzing by the time we left. 

Overall I had a great experience. It's a great way to get social with friends, or get to know a date. It is also relatively inexpensively and highly entertaining."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the owner, Jaro, who is a genuinely nice guy. Two weeks ago, I called in asking about a board game and when I arrived, the last copy was sold. Jaro let me borrow the store copy for a couple hours, since I lived around the corner and had been by many times before. Can't help but want to support a business in our community like that!

Their gelato is also very good! My favs are the pistachio, mango and lemon."}
{"text":"The variety of game is quite standard considering the size of the place. Not really meant for large groups or a lot of people. The drinks are pretty good. Menu is quite small. And let's just say there is no room for moving around if they had a full house. Maybe around 8-10 tables at most."}
{"text":"Came here to play board games on a Sunday afternoon.  It sits on the street forested by other residential houses - if it wasn't for the sign and the windows peering the interior, I could've sworn people lived in there :P  Kinda out of a storybook, especially on the snowy day that we went.

We made a reservation just in case it would be full on a Sunday, but luckily it wasn't too packed.  What makes a board game cafe is not just the variety of games - though I did appreciate this one having had .. e.g., Chinese checkers, which the board game cafes downtown didn't have.  For these cafes, it's really the service that keep people coming; and chit-chat-play was great for this :)  

I think it was either the manager or the owner of the cafe that decided to teach us how to play one of the games that we chose, which was a really nice gesture considering we didn't even ask :)  He then brought out two more games that he thought we'd enjoy with our party size.  And so, I'll probably come back here next time I'm in the area with a group of friends :)"}
{"text":"Great service with a great selection on both drinks and board games. A little hard to find due to construction but we'll worth hunting for. The games are clean and very well cared for and you can tell the owner really enjoys the games himself. 

Will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Great little place in Richmond Hill...the Galeto is amazing.

I walk -in on a Saturday night without any reservation but the staff call other reservations and found one group that is going to cancel so we got a table. So make sure you call ahead to reserve a table. 

The games library is fairly good.  But the staff are either too busy or  don't know the games enough to teach so prepare to read rule book.  

I will definitely go back with my friends"}
{"text":"This is a really cute board game cafe in Markham. Be aware of the wait times because there are only 4-5 tables here - you can call and ask for them to reserve a table for you. It's a bit pricier than most board game places - around $10 for unlimited play and $12 with a drink (weekends). They have a pretty good selection of drinks and desserts so definitely give those a try. I usually order a green tea latte and they use real matcha powder. Last but not least, the board game selection is pretty good and they have all the essentials :) great place to chill and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Service in my opinion was slow and not helpful. Seemed like they had a lot of games over flowing in counter space and where people could be seated and couldn't find a seat."}
{"text":"Game ON!!

Chit-Chat-Play Board Game Cafe is such a welcoming addition to the Neighborhood! Opens till 2 am on weekends for your gaming pleasure.

I came here twice once to watch the World Cup and once to enjoy some fun time with other Yelpers for a few hours of game time ($8 unlimited play with a drink $3.25). 

I really have a good time as the staff here is really patient and more than happy to show us and even act as a referee while we trying to figure out the rules and so we would try to \"kill\" each other for the win. 

There are so many games here so I am planning to come back and play them all!

The drink menu though extensive with espresso drinks and brewed tea could some time be a miss. My cappuccino was a little too milky to my liking. The gelato though is delicious! 

Even if you are not into gaming, you can always come here and enjoy a cup of tea with your friends and use their wifi and hang out a little.

Ample parking at the back of the complex."}
{"text":"We made reservations for a group of 8 a week prior to when we were going ...only to find out when we got there that there was no table reserved for us. They asked if we called them back for a second confirmation. Which is unreasonable since they never asked us to call them again - and if you want a second confirmation, YOU should be calling your customer back. I'm certain that they basically forgot about our reservation and came up with that excuse to cover up the fact. If I could give this place 0/5 I would. I have zero tolerance for poor customer service especially when all you have for your customers are excuses. 

tldr; We won't be back."}
{"text":"When I visited this place with a group of 6 other friends on a Friday afternoon, the whole café was pretty packed. I was lucky that my friend made a reservation, because without it we probably wouldn't have gotten a seat. I didn't order a drink, but my friends ordered the white chocolate latte and the green tea latte, and said that they were pretty good.

The selection of board games is pretty good. They have hundreds of board games to choose from, and most of them are new and interesting games that I haven't seen before. They also have a small chalkboard beside the washroom indicating the most popular games of the week. 

Overall, this café is a good place to socialize and enjoy playing a variety of board games with friends. However, I would say that the café is fairly small and tight; the space only seats about 20 people. Also the café charges $6 except for Friday-Sunday, when the price goes up to $8. Considering the space and packed house, the price is a bit higher than it should be. For these reasons, I decided to give this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Decent place uptown to play board games but a little more pricey compared to all the options downtown if you wanted to only play for less than 2 hours. The space is akin to a small cafe and only has less than 10 tables. My boyfriend and I came Saturday late afternoon and it wasn't busy. It's $10 for unlimited play so it's probably better for mid-sized group of friends who plan to stay longer. There's a good amount of games but I've seen larger collections."}
{"text":"This cute board game cafe seemingly sprouted in the middle of nowhere (well, actually around hwy 404 and Elgin Mills). The place is small, so reservations are recommended if you want to go at busier times. You can play all day for $6, and the owner is very friendly and is always happy to make recommendations or teach a new game. They also have many board games for sale!

My only complaint is that the tables are a tad small and can hardly fit the game boards + drinks."}
