{"text":"I always was a fan of family brunch. And this place, was perfect for this. The food, is excellent, simple and have a lot of dishes to offer. For those, who have a sweet tooth in the morning you will be amazed by the choices. Don't worry, there is also salty dishes such as eggs beneticts, scrambled eggs ; etc. Sometimes, it can be pretty loud but that's basically the main down problem, which happens in a lot restaurants."}
{"text":"Le restaurant était souvent froid lors de mes visites.  Le problème pour moi, c'est le service. L'accueil se fait rapidement, mais dès que l'on s'assoit ça commence à être long.  Le pire c'est après avoir mangé. On attend notre facture encore et encore.  Payer à la caisse debout entre la cuisine et l'entrée c'est aussi étrange.  Pourquoi ne pas payer aux tables dans ce cas?"}
{"text":"Came in from the cold for some coffee and a good breakfast. Greeted by a friendly host and seated quickly. Waitress was super friendly. The food is actually quite good. My wife had the veggie omelette which she always enjoys. I had the Special Expert which is 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and enjoyed it very much.   Great breakfast place in Lasalle. Plenty of parking, and there's a Nautilus nearby if you want to burn it off lol."}
{"text":"Consistent quality, at a mid range price. The service is good and friendly.  The waffles are a must try. They use bbq seasoning on the homefries."}
{"text":"Déjeuner copieux et excellent à prix raisonnable. Les casseroles sont divines ainsi que les crêpes. Service courtois et attentionné."}
