{"text":"Raw meat inside of appetizer.  Too lemony flavor in hummus.  Too thick of a cut of gyro meat.  No blue cheese dressing for wings.  Didn't have one of the desserts we wanted, even though it was on the menu.  Yummy rice pudding though.  Sorry to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food but pricey for a lunch, no lunch specials, and the day we went, we're told they were no longer accepting Groupons, which was 3 months before expiration!  Won't bother to go back"}
{"text":"Very good service and wonderful food! All around a great restaurant. The chicken kabob was amazing & very flavorful!"}
{"text":"We just discovered this place. The meals were great. I had chicken kabob wrap and my wife had beef shawarma. The live music complemented the food to create the perfect environment. Everything was authentically Middle Eastern."}
{"text":"The BEST Lebanese/Mediterranean food in Arizona and the USA! We almost ordered everything on the menu and they were all so delicious. The quality of the food is excellent and fresh, the food was made while your waiting, and the appetizers were to die for plus the prices were decent and affordable! 5 STARS all the way.  We were treated with a white clove service from the owner Mr. Lorenzo very friendly, to the Manager Mr. Shawn hospitality, to the BEST cooks Amal, and Eileen. They all came to our table to make sure we were okay they made us feel at home.  Definitely we will be eating there every week"}
{"text":"Only did carry out. However, started out with a bad impression when someone answer the phone \"Hello?\", thought I had the wrong number.  They transferred me to somebody else willing to say more than one word and I placed my order. It was ready quickly, which I'm a fan of. As I was walking in I got a little worried, saw several people smoking cigarettes and hookah on the patio, with the doors of the dining room wide open. Sure enough, as I walk in you would have thought this was a restaurant that allowed smoking.  It was obvious that the manager knew the people, probably ownership and or friends. Huge turn off. Obviously no regard. Walk up to the bar to get my order and even though there were only three full tables. the lady working was overwhelmed, which was obvious by how many times she mentioned how overwhelmed she was. Just got my order and went home, overall a weird vibe there. Ordered the gyro and shawarma platter. I thought the gyro meat was a little dry, but the shawarma did the job. I'm a big fan of the Mediterranean food, hope this place turns around. I'll give them another chance or two, but there appears to be some competition in the neighborhood so they will not get my blind loyalty."}
{"text":"We had the chicken shawarma, lamb kebab, and roasted red pepper hummas. It was all good but the hummas really shinned. Had a great waiter, Joe, who helped us choose some great food and answered all of our questions."}
{"text":"Fresh.  Delicious.  Our waitress Greer was a pro and made us feel at home.  We found ourselves a new place to relax and be treated well."}
{"text":"Went there today (Father's Day) at 11:20 AM and the place was closed.   No one in sight.   Yelp claims they open at 10AM."}
{"text":"I am a food lover especially, Mediterranean. I was excited to see a new restaurant with such great reviews so gave it a try. Unfortunately my experience was not so great. I went there with my family and took my parents along. It was cold inside as the heater was broke and what turned us off the most was \"not so clean\" silverware. They looked like they were half cleaned eeww..  What we liked: Baba ghanoush, pita bread, baklava Not so much: Chicken shawarma was nothing to brag about and kebabs were burnt Service: average"}
{"text":"Called in to go order....told it was going to take 25 mins. Got there and place was empty; the order had not been communicated to the kitchen so had to wait 20 mins for food to be cooked.  Chicken was dry and rice too salty."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and ordered the gyro with side salad.  The food was good and wasn't too pricey.  Only complaint is the temperature inside was too hot."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Was a Sunday night. Only 2 other tables but there was a large group of maybe 17-18 having an event. We waited ONE HOUR after ordering before getting any food. 2 other tables got up and left before being served.  No one ever came out to explain or really apologize, or when food finally arrived to offer to comp something or buy a dessert or whatever.  That small gesture would've garnered my sympathy and positive feelings about the customer service so that I would've relayed that nice gesture on to friends in the form of a recommendation.  Small price to pay to get multiple new people in. NOW, without any gesture, they lose not only my business, but have incurred my wrath & advice to others to stay away unless you like twiddling your thumbs waiting on food for over an hour. A much bigger loss.  And by the way, the chicken swarma was dry and overlooked."}
{"text":"I waited for this place to open but when I went there for dinner, no one served us. No one greeted us at the door although there were only about 3 full tables. We sat down and no one came to serve us, although the server stood at the bar and looked at us for about 5 minutes. We left."}
{"text":"Terrible owner, no customer service a skills. He will yell at you and doesn't even know what he is saying. This place won't last long this summer if he treats his customers like this. Order was wrong. At Least Steve is keeping this place afloat with his customer service skills."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and really like the place. It's tucked into a corner of the shopping center next to the Wells Fargo Bank. The food is good and the service is friendly. We usually order appetizers, drinks and dinner.  They have a large menu with pictures to help you order if you're not experienced in eating Middle Eastern food.  Portions are large and one entrée could easily be shared by two. We've tried several of the appetizers including the hummus, cheese borek &  sambousek, all of them have been very good. The beef kebabs and gyro plate are particularly good. Most of the entrées come with rice and some pickled vegetables.  They have a full bar but are sometimes are out of basic liquors or drink garnishments. Unfortunately they only have a limited selection of wines. The decor is beautiful and they play middle eastern music videos which helps set the mood. On some Friday evenings they have belly dancers and Middle Eastern live music. The wait staff is very nice and attentive however somewhat inexperienced. The one downfall is the restrooms which are not very clean. Overall this is a good choice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Didn't even know this place was here. Stopped by when I noticed it. Nothing fancy, but I had a great meal. I had the filet mignon kabob. Cooked exactly how I ordered and the staff couldn't ha e been more friendly. I'll definitely be back. Also, the baklava was great."}
{"text":"Just wonderful!  Brittany was our server and she was so nice, had great suggestions and was very attentive.  The food was fabulous!  Everything was home made, hummus, banaganoush, dolmas, tatziki and omg the borek!!!!  Please give them a try, you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The first time that I went there, my gyro had old, mealy tomatoes, and I forgave them. But my second visit will be my last, as they added a new feature to the old, mealy tomatoes-- a blackened, burnt pita! And you know that they knew because it was so visibly charred. Perhaps they didn't care because my order was for carry out, so they perhaps bet on me not returning it. That's where they were right. I hope it was worth it, though; they just lost my family's business and, after you see my picture, yours."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely astonishing. As a new restaurant i was highly impressed.  The instant one walks in you cant help but feel welcome, everyone is constantly greeting you. As well the manager is very friendly making sure everything is in perfect standings. Our food took no more than 15 mins to be prepared,  well worth the wait.  The gyro i ate was incredible. Hands down one of the most unique restaurants to try. The friendly atmosphere with exquisite food only make this restaurant experience astonishing, one in a few iv had! Highly recommend to come try; bring your family, friends. Like me they will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We tried Rotana because of the Groupon deal. We found a sign on the door saying that they no longer honor Groupon or Yelp. Because we had committed to meet another couple there, we decided to stay and eat. The service was very good as was the food. But because of the duplicitous nature of them luring us there, we won't return and I can only give them one star."}
{"text":"Just tried rotana for lunch.  First of all great looking restaurant. Love the fact tbey serve a full bar . lunch special prices hands down the cheapest in moon valley.any other greek restaurant wants $10 plus for lunch.food was amazing i ate the gyro sandwich.bread was soft .vegetables were fresh.meat was flavorful.will definitely be back for hookah and dinner.cant wait to try the filet and chicken kabobs"}
{"text":"Had a delightful lunch with the combination platter and a darling attentive waitress. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Rotana.  My husband and I were very impressed with the fresh and great tasting authentic food.  The service was fabulous and the restaurant was clean and had good ambiance.   The manager came to our table and asked how everything was.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"As some reviews have mentioned, great food, but the service could be a lot better. I went in with a Groupon, a few days ago, and had called the restaurant before I bought the coupon to ensure that the type of Groupon I had would be accepted with the party I was bringing. I had advised the man who answered the phone that I was planning on spending more than the $40 the Groupon allotted and he assured me that the Groupon would be accepted. Fast forward about a week to two weeks later, I have my family with me in the restaurant for my mom's birthday. I, of course, spent more than $40 on the meal. When I presented the Groupon, the waiter(Ramin), looked at it for a second and flat out said \"we can't accept this.\" I had told him that I had called the day before I purchased the Groupon, and was assured that it would be accepted. Long story short, he pretty much called me a liar, despite me showing him when I called the restaurant to confirm that it would be OK to use this particular Groupon. After arguing with him for a minute, he called his manager who gave him the go ahead to honor the Groupon. I still tipped him although he surely didn't deserve it, since that's the kind of person I am. I called a manager(who was really nice and polite) to advise her of the situation and she advised she was going to be letting the owners know what had happened since it seems that there have been other complaints about the same waiter. They lost a customer because of this waiter's poor attitude, which is unfortunate since the food was amazing and the ambiance was something that I've never experienced at a Mediterranean restaurant,before(music videos playing, couches set up, a full bar, etc.). My suggestion is I wouldn't purchase a Yelp deal or a Groupon for this restaurant since it seems that the staff have problems honoring them. I almost felt as if it were a bait and switch, you're lied to in order to be lured in and then when you have your meal and have wracked up a hefty bill, they make up an excuse as to why they can't accept your Groupon. It looks like this restaurant has had nothing but good reviews, up until the month of December, which makes me wonder if the same waiter was the cause of this. Beware!   Note to management: I would strongly recommend getting rid of Ramin."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Was interested in trying some Mediterranean food. Go and check it out. I got the mixed sample platter and a few drinks. They have hukkah also if your interested in that."}
{"text":"The management has changed and the food was ok and it didnt even look the same as it was printed in the menu. The waiter was so rude and he denied to honor the groupon and was very very rude, they should ve stuck a flyer or informed us before dining. Also, the waiter hardly came to your table, it wasnt even busy, there were hardly couple of people dining there. Wont be going there ever and wont recommend my friends as well. The food was also undercooked and it wasn't really mediterrenean style. Hopefully groupon can refund us the money...We ended up spending way too much and it wasnt worth it... It really ruined our dinner with my friends..."}
{"text":"My Dad and I were driving around looking for a place to eat, and he saw the sign and the lights on, and asked me if I felt like Mediterranean. I said sure, so we pulled in just to take a look. We'd never seen it before and we thought it might be new.  As we walked in we saw a bunch of tables pushed together in the center, and we thought maybe it was closed for a party, and we were just going to grab a menu.   It turns out they were doing a food tasting to prep for their opening - supposed to be this week or next - and they had staff and the family of staff coming in and out to try various dishes they kept refilling the table with.  I can't speak to price, because I didn't see a menu.   I can speak to quality - and because we had almost the entire menu at our fingertips, I can speak to a lot of their dishes. The food was EXCELLENT! They said they'll be making their own Pita bread soon. My Dad LOVED the grape leaves, the Hummus was PERFECT! Not dry, not to moist, no oily or sandy texture, the Kafta was also amazing, great flavor, subtle but absolutely present, very moist. The Chicken Shawerma was Barbequed, it had an excellent marinade, but it was a little dry. The tabooli had an excellent flavor and texture, not too much lemon.   The ambiance was bright, friendly, and comfortable. There was music not so loud that we couldn't hear ourselves speak, but loud enough to enjoy. The seating was comfortable, and obviously flexible. You could have a date here, or you could have an office lunch here. Pushing the tables together is often awkward - these tables were created to be joined.   All of the food was delicious. And the company If Customer Service is as important to you as it is to me, I'm going to try to paint a good picture for you. I cannot stress how amazing this staff was - The second we poked our noses in the door someone came over and welcomed us in, invited us to the table. They said they were doing menu testing, and would be honored if we would join them. This is the sort of thing that makes me incredibly uncomfortable. A stranger among friends, and I don't make it easy on people, I'm very introverted around strangers. Two minutes in I was dining with people who could have been my family. Staff was introduced, their families were introduced. There was a constant stream of food coming in, plates going out, people coming in, people getting up, but at no point did we feel like we'd invaded their private gathering, and we always had someone to talk to. They made it a point to keep a Host or Hostess at the table, and we were always introduced. If they are going to be that welcoming to someone walking by, not paying for dinner or tipping - I can't WAIT to see these people in action. Any any attempt to pay for what we ate, or tip someone - was scoffed at. Our feedback was more important to them, not even anyone to tip! I will be returning, and I do tip on a sliding scale based on service. I plan to ALWAYS have an extra few bucks to lay down when I leave.   They have created is a small piece of Mediterranean heaven in our Sonora Desert. I hope they open soon - I'll be keeping tabs. And maybe I'll see you there!"}
{"text":"I took a couple friends for Lebanese food here recently. I am Lebanese and often extra picky about Lebanese restaurants. The food was actually pretty good. The meat dishes were a bit too greasy for my taste but overall the food was great and I would go back. The service, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired. We were not greeted when we came in at all and sat ourselves because no one acknowledged us. The waiter was lacking in customer service. He was pleasant but kind of clueless. The experience was ok, certainly not great."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was shitty. We got there and there was like no one there. The service was slow and the one waiter didn't talk much. We went to order and he told us he had to get all our drinks first before one of us ordered an appetizer. Overall disappointing"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious food - very authentic!! They fly in famous singers for live music every weekend! For all you hooka lovers they have a menu of different types of tobacco. All smoking is done outside which I love coming home with my hair still smelling beautiful. All of their hummus and baba are made daily. This is one start us restaurant that I hope to see around for a long time. If you come in the evening ask for Steven. He's the bartender and is absolutely fabulous."}
{"text":"This place was not the greatest place to eat. The service is really slow and the food seems like it was left out and reheated. The restaurant was fairly clean but my table still had some food left over from the last person who was seated there. Honestly I would just go to haji baba if you want a good meal. A lot better than rotana. They deserve this one star."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is excellent. Portions are big and it's full of flavor.  With that being said, the service there leaves something to be desired. The lady that helped me with my take out order was pleasant enough, but the gentleman that came over to help was pretty rude. I purchased a yelp voucher and my order total came out to about $3.50 more  than the voucher amount and I gave him my debit card to pay the remaining amount. He says we can't take your card for this amount, I didn't have any cash on me and since I wanted to add a tip, I said that I would add $5.00 for a tip. He reluctantly ran my card and I thanked him. The only response I got from him was, your food is over there. I may go back cause the food was good, but another experience like that, I won't be going back and I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The food was mostly OK. The chicken shwarma was delicious, the baba ganoujh is quite good though they always short you on the pita bread; you can get more if you ask but why should you have to ask? Four slices is not enough for the portion they serve. The tabbouleh salad, however, was mostly a bowl of chopped parsley with a sparse garnish of cucumber bits. Served watered-down wine. The service was completely incompetent, from being incapable of correctly splitting a check two fucking ways (even though each party wrote down its own separate order as the server requested...), to making a minimal effort to clear the table of finished plates and glasses as well as only freshening our drinks once in the two and a half hours we were there."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch today. The Hummus appetizer was delicious and came with warm pita bread. Absolutely delicious and it was very nicely presented. My husband had the Combo Kebab plate and I had the Chicken Kebab plate. Both were really good, and the grilled veggies that adorned the plate were a nice touch. Will definitely be back again I would love to try out their Hookah and cocktails. Good dining experience and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Let me begin with a simple statement! The owner and manager of this establishment feels it ok to not only disrespect their hard working only employee on the floor but do so in front of my children! I brought my wife and 2 children for lunch. The wonderful smiling server greater us as soon as possible with a smile and great ideas for our meals! Despite how busy she was Britney was her name was left by herself with no busser or real help. While the manager sat through most everything our server continued to smile and treat my wife and children wonderfully! Then comes our food! The kids were fed first perfect timing but then 20 minutes later after I have my plate and my kids are almost done my wife gets her hummus plate with 1 piece of bread! I asked Britney for more bread pita she called it and she went to get this pita! The servers have to stop everything and grill our pita where the boss comes to the kitchen to loudly and rudely tell our server no the customer pays for more bread. Wait a minute a whole plate of hummus with 1 piece of bread that's it? Britney told us that she would have to charge still smiling is that ok?  Then the boss gets angry and asks her right on the floor what did you just say to my customer? The way that he talked to her in front of all of her customers and in front of my children! Completely unacceptable. I told Britney I would be leaving this review I waited outside with the children while the wife got her nails done. Britney tried to go up to her boss sitting on the couch again with maybe a son or friend to have one manager speak with us they refused to speak with me!  As my wife was leaving from her nails we looked into the restaurant and our server was standing there close to tears from the looks surrounded by a female the old guy boss and the gentleman from the couches. The way she was treated in front of US tells what must have been going on!  My review of this setting is zero stars! Your kitchen is a mess your management is rude and your attitude towards what customers need from their visits are less than favorable."}
{"text":"This is close by to where we live so was watching for it to open.  Went in on a Saturday afternoon - place was empty and all the staff was out on the patio smoking a hookah.  Not a good first impression.  A waiter came up fairly quickly, gave us menus and then took our order.  He and what I am figuring was his mom were very friendly.  My husband ordered the chicken shwarma sandwich and I ordered the beef.  My mistake -- he loved his -- I hated mine - why - because it was basically a gristle and fat sandwich.  Ugh........  The tabouli was super good though.  If I go back I will never order the beef and I do not recommend it.  Also in my own opinion, the prices are way on the high side.  I would much rather eat at Good Fellas Grill on 19th Ave.  I do not expect this place to be open very long unless they change things via pricing and quality of food."}
{"text":"Our family group of 9 opted to try Rotana for dinner on Mothers Day.  We were anticipating a bit of a wait due to the nature of the day but even with that the wait was horrendous.    When we arrived, there were approximately 20 patrons seated over 4 tables and only 1 server working.  She did a very good job of trying to take orders, act as the bartender, bus tables and wait on patrons all while trying to keep a smile on her face.  Unfortunately she was receiving ZERO help from the owner or the guy behind the bar polishing glasses.  It took 30 minutes just to get water then an additional 30 minutes just to get our drink and food orders placed.  All this time the owner just sat around watching.   Finally after 90 minutes our food stared to arrive.  Delivery of the meal took an additional 30 minutes so by the time the first served had eaten the final entrees were hitting the table.  Several of us opted to just take it to go.  Total time for the meal was 2 1/2 hours.  I do have to say the quality of the food was great but the owner needs to get with the program or this place won't last.    Lastly, the Armenian music videos depicting dead children washing up on the beach on 6 tv's in the place is a disgusting turn off while you're trying to eat.  Server- A for effort without management support Food- A for taste and quality Experience- F.  Can't grade it any lower"}
{"text":"Got the Combo plate that is usually $22. Not worth it. The portions are half of what the menu picture shows. The meat was edible. Nothing special. The rice tasted like instant, or frozen premade stuff. Not good. I also got the hummus and the Armenian Salad. Hummus was ok. Again nothing special. The thing about the salad was, they didn't even start making it until the Combo plate was out. Who is going to eat a salad last? I was already totally underwhelmed by the food, I didn't want to wait an extra 10-15min for a salad. The service was not that great either. There was hardly any other customers there. She admitted herself she wasn't very attentive. I will say she made up for it by bringing out some fresh Baklava. It was amazing. I would never pay that kind of money for the quality of food and service. Its too bad because I really wanted to like this place! There are Gyro spots all over the valley that are half the price and much better quality."}
{"text":"I was very impressed. Service was good food was awesome atmosphere was very soothing.. very nice date place.. loved it."}
{"text":"So disappointing... We really wanted to like this place, but the food was just not good and the service was very inefficient although they were friendly. All of the meat in the sampler platter was tough except for one piece and it definitely lacked flavor. We will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, my first time. Place was empty, I should've known. Waitress came, took my order, a regular gyros. After waiting 15 min. and wasting half my lunch break, still no food. I got upset. Waitress comes in, tells me she has something \"disturbing\" to tell me. Says they are \"making the meat as we speak\"... 'Nuff said, I walked out, not going back. No wonder this place is empty...."}
{"text":"Found Rotana through Groupon.    Food Quality - 4 Star.   The hummus appetizer had more garlic than I like to the point it had a mild burn with each bite. I would not personally order that again but we did eat the whole plate.  The main course Beef Filet Kabobs was outstanding, full 5 star.  I would go back for the food and try other appetizers.    Service - 2 Star.  I think our server was new and had an off night.  Slow to fill drinks and clear dishes.  Also had a few mess ups on our order and I don't think he new the menu well. Nice guy I just think he was new.  Atmosphere - 3 star with lots of potential. I would classify the atmosphere between a place you go for lunch and and an evening style restaurant.  The lights were too bright for a true evening style restaurant.  We had linen napkins yet no table linens.  The tables each had paper napkins dispensers not removed for the evening crowd.  Kind of mix matched that could be solved easily.  They also have hookah pipes available on the outside patio.  Not really my thing but that seemed to be popular among the guests. The bar area looked high end compared to the dining area.  Dimmer lights with a few tweaks would help match the atmosphere to the high quality of the food.    I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Had a VERY helpful server telling my mother the various ingredients in dishes as it was her 1st time eating Mediterranean. We ended up with two great dinners, Lamb kabob and chicken shawarma! Used a Groupon with no problems. Missed the live entertainment but table neighbor said they come every couple of months and it is fantastic. we'll go back some weekend for sure."}
{"text":"Just had another excellent dinner at Rotana.  It is a great spot for take out as well.  If you are not sure what you want, try one of the sampler items on the menu.  I had the kabob sampler last night and all 3 meats were prepared to perfection.  Place has a great Mediterranean vibe too.  A fun little oasis in North Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The shawarma was badly burned, the flatbread tasted like something from Costco. The entire time there was a weird guy sitting in the corner taking loudly on his phone. He was obviously an employee or a family member. It was also very cold in the restaurant. The kanafe however was very tasty. The food was also very expensive, considering the poor quality. I would not return."}
{"text":"Great food. The hummus was excellent and the Kafka burger was very juicy and full of flavor. Baklava was very good too!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Rotana . The best food and service best welcome from the owner Mr. Lawrence . And also the best Arabian night club in town with a variety of singers and very class people        .    .     .   ."}
{"text":"They are Not Open. We drove by to try it out, and as of Friday,  6/25/15, the doors were chained."}
{"text":"If I lived in Arizona, I'd be spending most of my mullah here. The atmosphere is fun and lively with its middle eastern vibes. A major downfall for me tho is the hookah. I don't smoke but I wanted grape leaves so bad when I was visiting Arizona. I saw this place had dope reviews and a Yelp deal I couldn't refuse. So convinced my friend to go.   The deal stated that we had to dine in, but the the place was packed. And honestly, I didn't want to eat inside because everyone was smoking. (Clouds everwhere) Some people may love the fact that you can smoke up(sheesha not 420) and eat up. However, that's not my thing.   So I asked the owner if I could carry out and use my Yelp deal. He was so kind and cool with it. I ordered there combo and it was delicious!! Chicken is cooked to perfection and the meat is well seasoned. But be sure to ask/order sauce. Apparently you have to ask/order it cause my order didn't come with any."}
{"text":"Friendly staff however sometimes they take a while to check on you. I've been there twice. The first time the food was amazing!!! Literally mouth watering, talking about it for days amazing. The service that day was also good. We had a man server and he kept bringing us out things to try! The second time was not as impeccable. The food was good but not nearly as good as the first and some of the things we wanted to order they did not have. Our server was friendly but I felt like she kept forgetting about us which was a little off putting since we were the only table in there. My best guess is dinner food is a lot better and don't expect the same service for lunch. I would recommend this place however."}
{"text":"I'm currently in a happy food coma after some delicious gyro from Rotana, so I figured now is as good a time as any to leave a review! Ever since moving to the neighborhood this summer, we've been going to Rotana. The food is excellent!  Meat is very high quality, and they have several authentic and savory dishes. I love the gyro salad, gyro pita, and baba ghanoosh. The sample platter of meats, while pricey, is delicious. Granted, I've never eaten in the restaurant (we always order to go), but they are always friendly and accommodating. They don't seem very busy, which is a shame. They don't deserve the bad reviews I've read on here. I'm glad to have them in our \"eating out\" rotation. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"The food was great, and worth the little extra most places charge, but it's a restaurant, not a gyro n burger place. Very clean, I've never seen glasses so clean, spotless silverware. I'd definitely come back again. I wasn't a huge fan of the Pita bread, but that's my ONLY complaint"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is incredible!!! Amazing food, drinks, hookah and live entertainment on the weekends!!! I know where I will be this weekend!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have such an amazing restaurant so close to home!  It's about time someone knows how to have fresh, authentic, delicious Mediterranean cuisine!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I visited this location for the first time on Sunday night 2/28/16. Although the place was mostly empty and it was just 2 of us, we waited almost an hour for our food.  This experience was made worse by the fact that we saw a couple of employees, some dressed like they might be in management, notice us sitting there and no one ever checked on us.  I had to track down our server for a refill on water!  When we finally got our food, I had to ask if they were short staffed or something and I was told they were but again, no one bothered to let us know what was going on or offer anything for our wait or check on us at all.  The food was very good so I can see why there is a 4 star review but the service was as bad as I have experienced.  Regretted going by the time we were done and will not go back."}
{"text":"I went here last weekend and honestly I did not think the food was that great! It was quite empty in there and it took an awful long time to get our food! Also the staff was friendly but I thought that it was tacky that some of the staff sat outside and did hookah instead of managing the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Really good food. My husband and I had dinner there tonight and the food was excellent. The service was also very good. I've read some of the negative comments here and I think some folks are just whiners. I mean, leaving the door open? That's done at lots of places. I guess I feel that when a new business opens up, you have to cut them a little slack. There are always things that don't go right at the beginning. We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"New place, had the hummus app, pita was dry, hummus was standard. Both my wife and I had the chicken kabob. Chicken was very tender, the salad was fresh and the dressing was a spicy vinaigrette. I will say this place has some growing to do. They are about to obtain their liquor license and offer hookah. Our server Jocelyn was great, friendly and attentive. Try it!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We actually cam to this restaurant through yelp, unsure of what to have for dinner that night and Mediterranean sounded good. We got there and there were only 2 other groups and a lady picking up take away. First thought was should we really be eating here, it's empty. Mind you, it was a Monday night around 7:30pm. So we sat down, checked out the menu, while listening to great mediterranean music, lots to choose from and everything looked great. We got the vegetarian combo plate, amazing, fresh and delicious. It had dolmeh (hot not cold, cold are shit) humus, baba ganouj, tabouli (amazing) and falafels, then for the main we had the lamb kabob. The lamb had the best flavor but was a little over done for us, so make sure you ask for you meat cooked to your liking as we didn't ask. The rice was amazing, so much flavor. For dessert we had baklava. Now we are connoisseurs of baklava and have a very particular taste for which ones are good and which ones are not. This baklava is made in house with fresh ingredients and the most perfect baklava I have ever tasted. (I haven't been to Greece yet though) I highly recommend this restaurant, they have live music and bands and I'll def be going back for that. It may look a little dodgy and in a dog area, but it is well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Mediocre lamb/kabobs. Kabob platter had only rice. No veggies sauce or anything with it. Chicken is decent though. They are sketchy about the yelp deal. Don't get it."}
{"text":"Purchased the Groupon... bad choice. My family and i were the only people in the entire place.  The food was just so so. Almost gross imho. The groupon meal turned out to be very small.  My husband ate the entire meal by himself.  The rest of its were starving... however certainty not going to order anything rider from here. The prices were very high for the amount of food being served. Just all around a horribly idea to try this place.  Will ever go back."}
{"text":"We were on our way home from a bike ride and caught that this place was open today and had a great meal and service! Thought it was reasonable priced for the large amount of food you got!  Atmosphere was very pleasant! Trying to get the kinks out we were told before their grand opening in a couple of weeks I believe!"}
{"text":"Great food with horrible service. The manager was beyond anal. He hacked off a table of 10 sitting next to us and  she threatened to never come back again if he didn't take some hot water off her bill. We had the 15 dollar for 30 deal. After we were done eating we were told we hadn't ordered enough to use the deal. we had to go OVER 30 dollars. They were out of all the deserts but 1 . So we had to wait for a good 5 minutes at the cash register while he argued with this lady over water.  yikes."}
{"text":"The service was the redeeming quality of the restaurant. We had a great server who helped to fix our meal when a piece of chicken from our kabob was served undercooked. He brought out a completely new kabob and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  The menu was a bit outdated. Several meals were advertised as being sold with grilled vegetables. When we ordered, we found out that grilled veges were no longer served with any meals. We asked if we could order a side of some other vegetables instead and it turns out they simply don't serve vegetables... period. For whatever reason, they did have some zucchini and they offered to grill some up for us. Very kind of them.   Not all of their dessert selections were available.  This seemed like a good place for a night out with a group of adults. Loud music. Lounging areas. Bar seating. Outdoor seating.  We've eaten at other similar restaurants and felt that this placed served just as good of food, but with less quantity and at a higher price. We appreciated that our server took care of us, but we don't feel this will be a place we'll be returning to."}
{"text":"We liked Rotana.  We went for lunch on a Saturday.  The server was friendly and followed up on questions I had.  The food was really good.  I wasn't sure based on the feedback I read.  We will be returning.  Everything we ordered was really great."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with family. Rotana serves traditional Mediterranean and Arabic delicacy. They also serve hookah on patio area. Guest service was great and their manager constantly check on us and made sure everything was on point."}
{"text":"My brother and I went here after seeing the mixed review. First, the greeting. There was a little bit of awkwardness when we first got there, but someone came up after a couple minutes. We were able to seat ourselves. The waiter came along promptly and gave us menus. He was super nice and personable.   We ordered and got our food all within 20 min. The food was good, not great. The chicken was my favorite. The filet was flavorless, but it was cooked perfectly. The garlic sauce on the side was so good. The portion was smaller than anticipated. Again, nothing was wonderful - but it was good.   The true magic of the establishment was the music videos. Hypnotizing!!! The videos were so fun. One looked like a trailer for a video game.  Would I go back, maybe? The chicken was really good. I wouldn't get the filet again. The waiter was wonderful. The food was decent. The ambiance was fun due to the music videos. Maybe give it a go."}
{"text":"Loved it. Generous portions. Had a chopped salad that was prepared so well, nice cuts, nice ingredients and ingredient proportions. Basmatic rice prepared nicely and fluffy. Meats well seasoned and great portions. Loved the real deal grilling and roasting. Decor and ambiance were nice as well.  Little pricey but got the coupon on here....definetly worth the money if you have out of town guests or family.     Curious about the weekend night scene, we were told they had live entertainment and music, so we will have to return for round two of great food and get a dose of Mediterranean night life."}
{"text":"After double checking the website to make sure they were open until 9PM I purchased a Yelp deal to eat at Rotana. I called at 8:20 to place an order to be picked up and was told that the kitchen was closed. I responded that their web site said they were open until 9PM. The man responded that they were tired and wanted to go home. I hung up a little dismayed at the lack of customer service.   I called right back and asked to speak to a manager. A woman got on the phone and said she would get the manager. She returned about a minute later and  informed me that the manager had gone home. I told her what had happened and she said the kitchen closed at 8:30. I said, it's 8:23! It was 8:20 when I called the first time. Get your story straight people.  I guess I'm going another time because, well I bought the coupon. Hopefully the in house service is better than over the phone . . . sheesh.  P.S. - Yelp offered to refund my voucher and after reading all the issues others have had with service I decided to accept it."}
{"text":"It's always hit and miss with Rotana, but I love their meat so I give them 4 stars. They always have different employees but they have all been nice. There are times when it is pretty dead. I always get their kofta and their lentil soup. I like that their menu is pretty big with a variety of food from all over the Middle East. They play middle eastern music videos on their TVs which are fun to watch. All in all the place is pretty solid I just wish they were more consistent."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Service was great but they were out of several things we ordered. Hummus was less than average. Other items lacked flavor. Would not go back"}
{"text":"Rotana is a great new restaurant for this neighborhood.  I love their big wrap around patio. We had dinner there last night and we will be going back soon because we were really pleased.  Great prices for big portions of perfectmy prepared dishes.  I had the chicken shwarma plate, because I had tried the lunch chicken shwarma sandwich takeout and loved it.  The chicken is flavorful and juicy, with sauteed onions.  My co workers who were unfamiliar with Mediterranean food all loved the shwarmas and gyros.   They have many beers on draft, their own home made juices, and they serve hookah (on the patio only).   I would definitely meet friends here for dinner, good atmosphere and nice wait staff and owner.  The owner mentioned that they will have live music soon!   We didn't order the baklava, but after seeing others who did order, it will be a must next time- flaky, gooey, nutty, crunchy.. I can't wait!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Rotana tonight and WOW. First of all, the $15 for $30 deal from Yelp is awesome and worked out perfectly to feed 3 people. The food was incredible, I had a gyro wrap and the Babba Ghanouj. The gyro was LOADED with meat and very fresh even though I picked up my order at almost 9:30pm!! The Babba Ghanouj was delicious as well. Not a single complaint. The service I received upon arrival to pick up my order was friendly and efficient. Definitely going back and encourage everyone in North Phoenix looking for a good Mediterranean meal to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Some of the tastiest and best prepared Lebanese food I've had. Service was friendly - a bit inexperienced but sincere and well meaning. We'd definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! All of the food was great, especially the chicken Schwarma! Juicy and tender, and so full of flavor! Ramin, our waiter was also great and very nice. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Like most of the other reviews, I  loved this restaurant.  It was fabulous to finally have a neighborhood restaurant with really good tasting food.  Their homemade salad dressing and hummus made me and my husband coming back time and time again. Everything we had up until now was fantastic.  Unfortunately, they just hired a new chef and the food we had for lunch was just God awful.  Even the salad dressing has changed.  The chicken shawarma, which I ate on numerous occasions, was so bad I ended up throwing away my leftovers when I tried to eat them, which I never did before.  If Rotana reads this, PLEASE bring back your former chef, or send your new chef to culinary school."}
{"text":"Tried going there for lunch and the place was closed.  Did not see any hours listed anywhere to let you know what times they are open.  Apparently, not for lunch.  Will try for dinner.  But not impressed that a casual restaurant is not open for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The koftas are our favorite dish, this is not our first time as we come here at least once a week. Joe our server was incredible. This is some of the best mediterran food Ive had!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the server forgot several items on our order. The Knafeh was delicious though"}
{"text":"I'm so glad Rotana  finally opened.  We came here for lunch and shared Baba Ganouj. It had a beautiful smokey flavor. The Shawarma, and Gyro wrap  tasted fresh and delicious. We look forward to returning many times.  Good luck to Aida, our server. She was great"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 7 star review if I could  I went there one evening with my family and the food was breath taking we ordered the hummus which was breath taking I ordered the gyro place which was amazing my family was there first time trying authentic middle eastern food and they had to try the kabobs which were amazing the waiter Ramin was amazing and knew his menu they were on top of everything offered us dessert and we could not have said no from how good the food was and made us full but we wanted to experience the full deal we ordered the kenafe and some hot tea to cool our bellies down they also have hookah on the patio which I had to let my parents try that experience hookah was amazingly smooth kenafe came out and was just amazing with hookah and hot tea I will recommends this place to anyone and make sure I will go back at least once a week   Please check out the place I promise you will not regret it"}
{"text":"Still have to give them points for the food.   Amazing baked kibbee.      But sometimes you can't rely solely on the quality of the food.   I don't remember our waiters name,  maybe  Mark?  But here's a new twist for you. Interactive field trip to their bar.  He asked if we wanted drinks.   When we asked to see the wine list,  he said they are working on it.   We asked what they have and he pointed to the array of beer and wine at the bar and we had to go up and read the labels ourselves.   Let's hope it is a temporary diversion.   He never refilled our water glasses.   And we had to remind him to bring our appetizer before the main meal. My lamb was good but a tad overcooked.   I asked for medium rare.   No red or pink to be found.   My husband's gyros,  which he has had before and raved over,  was overcooked as well.   Hope they understand that they were really great.  Now let's get back to the way we were."}
{"text":"Best food! Best service !! I recommend Joe as a server!"}
{"text":"First tip: don't buy any deals or groupons if you don't want them to give you a bad attitude. After my order, when it was time to pay, I told the attendant that I got the Yelp deal, and you would have thought I told him to give me the food for free. Whole change of attitude. If they cannot do a deal due to some restrictions, that is ok... as long as you communicate them to me, but just giving me a face like if I am less customer because I got a deal, is not good. THen, I told him I would pay the gratuity as if I am dining in, and that was another problem. I was told no, until the owner saw no problem with it and allowed it. I paid the gratuitiy and then I get back to work to eat, and there is no napkins, no utensils, not even a fork in the bag. So, most likely not coming back. I liked their selection on appetizers. I can say that much, but when it came to service and flavor, I did not get the hype. But wish them good luck."}
{"text":"Authentic sophisticated flavors in every bite!!! We enjoyed our generously topped feta Greek Salad followed by a fabulous Mixed Grilled Meat platter with 3 incredible sauces: garlic, tahini, and tzatziki and Rice. We immediately began our mental list of which friends we would bring back. Yes, thats right, we are planning MANY return visits....Friendly, welcoming staff helped make our first visit extra special!!! Can't wait to go back and try the lunch specials. I'm totally hooked!! GO NOW..Go tomorrow..Go this week...SO YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've ever had. Must get the gyro plate and hummus platter!! We got a groupon for this place and they exceeded my expectations by a lot! Sooo good!!"}
{"text":"Great  place with interesting food. Very good and many appetizers. The host was very good and made sure we had a good time."}
{"text":"At the last minute, I needed help feeding 10 people on an OK budget pick up same day. I headed over to Chicago Gyro and was immediately told I couldn't be helped, so I left and headed over to Rotana. Which I should've done in the first place. I asked for some help, the gentleman made suggestions( vegetarian eaters) and was in and out in less than 10min with a pickup of 330, because they have a 100+ party later. I amazed on how willing they were to work with us on such short notice and even with a big party later. I'll never go back to Chicago Gyro......thanks Rotana!"}
{"text":"Rotana is a large Mediterranean Middle Eastern Style restaurant. They also offer an outside patio, a full bar and hookah and some weekend entertainment. They offer the largest middle eastern style menu I have ever seen. I was excited to see Muhammara (spicy red pepper walnut dip) on the menu so I had to order it. It was hard to tell what seasonings were in Rotana's version of this dip because it was a salt bomb. All I tasted was salt and I should have sent it back. It also lacked the heat it should have. Maybe someone just slipped with the salt on that batch and hopefully it's normally better.  Everything after the Muhammara was better.  We shared a Hot Appetizer Combo Plate.It was a big plate with lots of variety. Overall it was A-OK. Some things were better than other things. The falafels were different and not like what I was expecting. They were shaped like donuts and were oddly bread like.  Fortunately the best plate was the Rotana Combo Plate. We had Kefta, Chicken and Filet Mignon Kabobs with long grain rice. We both thought the chicken was the best of the three kabobs because it was nicely seasoned and moist. Steak had some tough chewy parts but was nicely flavored. Garlic sauce I thought was very harsh and concentrated with flavor.  This restaurant is clean and a grade \"A\" Maricopa Inspection Sign is posted in the window.  Service was fine.  Parking was easy."}
{"text":"I'm a long time mediterranean food lover. All my lifelong favorites are here, including kibbee naye, but only on Saturdays. I had the lamb chops and my friend had the chicken schwarma. We had hummus and tabouli as well. All were perfectly done. The waitperson was attentive and I believe overworked. However, she never complained and spent a great deal of energy dealing with multiple tables. I'm going back."}
{"text":"I've been in several times and the staff is always friendly and pleasant.   I'm a Mediterranean Food virgin and all of the recommendations from the staff are great!  Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"If I can give this place a negative star I would.  We have used their groupon/Yelp promotion twice which was awesome. Until the 3rd time and 4th I became super unhappy with their service and quality of food like seriously nothing was ever the same.  It's always so crowded when we go there's always some type of event going on.  We have not ate here except to-go every single time.  There is no consistency here at this place.  We loved their Greek salad but the flavor would always change or the ingredients.  Or one order we would get all the fixings but shortly after on the next order I would have to remind or ask if I can have pita bread and tzatziki sauce.  I'm sorry we fell in love with this place at first bite but after a few bites later I gave up, my husband loves the salad that's why he keeps going back but I won't not ever again!!!! He can go back but I won't."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekday about 2:30 with two friends. When we got there we were the only customers in the place. In spite of that, the service was pretty slow and there were problems with the order. Took a while to get them corrected. Once we got the right orders, the food was pretty good and the price was pretty reasonable. Not sure if I would come back though."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews for mediocre experiences but felt that I should give some honest feedback to balance the overall rating. Took advantage of the Yelp $15 for $30 deal.   We (fiance and I) came in around 5:30 on Sunday. There were about 14 +/- patrons, for a total of 3 parties.   Waiter was busy with the other tables while some other guy in a pink shirt yakked away on his cell phone while drying dishes, didn't seem concerned at all that his coworker was drowning with guests. He then proceeded to go on break for 20+ minutes, leaving the waiter hanging. Looks family-owned as Pink Shirt joined an older man out side on the patio to smoke hookah and a woman I presumed to be the mother was in the back cooking. I don't know what Pink Shirt's function is as an employee at this place but he didn't seem to have any value-added services.    We waited 10 minutes for just the menus, then another 10 minutes to place a drink order, and lastly an additional 10-15 minutes after that to place our food order for an accumulative total of 30+ minutes. We could tell our waiter was struggling, and we're patient people but this food better be good!   Our order arrives another 15-20 minutes later and it was decent. I ordered chicken kabobs with basmati rice and veggies with a side of dolmas. Rice was bland but the chicken and dolmas were very good. Fiancé ordered the gyro and said it was tasty as well. Fries were cooked perfectly.   It's a shame that the service facet struggled so much, this could have been a very different experience if they allocated their resources better. Waiter did try to provide good service and did apologize for the wait.   TL;DR: Decent food, nearly a 60 minute wait from being seated to receiving our meals. Slow service/poorly staffed."}
{"text":"I am so glad that Rotana is open! I love their selection of food. Not many places to get Lebanese or Armenian dishes.  The hummus with chicken shawarma is fantastic.  I love the mixed grill with lamb, chicken kabob, and kafta. The Labna dip has a hint of spice, it pairs well with any meat.  The rice is good. Comparable to most other places. It was fresh.  I ordered takeout 3 nights in a row. No complaints, my order was correct, it was a normal wait time, and each item was a good sized portion to generous. It has been remodeled inside. Only one large booth, the rest are tables. 2 patios to enjoy this gorgeous autumn weather. They have many flavors of shisha for hookah enthusiasts. There is an area for live music inside as well, ask for details.  Looks like a full bar too.  Currently offering a yelp deal.  Healthy choices for kids meals also. I'll be back many times. Happy hour- appetizers 3pm-6 or 7pm, I only glanced at the sign. To be updated."}
{"text":"We have both been to the Middle East several times, and are always happy to find a restaurant that serves authentic Middle Eastern food.  Rotana was amazing. We had hummus and kabobs.  The hummus was perfect, and came with warm pitas.  The kabobs were simply amazing. Our waiter was helpful, and the service was timely.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, and the food is always excellent - very fresh and well-prepared. Service is also good, and prices are reasonable.  My only request is that they lower the volume of the music a little - but that's just me."}
{"text":"Hubbs and I have been there several times and have to say, this place is D-lish! We've had lots of items: hummus, dolmeh (dolmades), gyro wrap, chicken shawarma, chicken kabob plate, beef filet kabob plate (which is filet mignon-yum) and many salads - ALL of which have been really good. We've become regulars!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying a new neighborhood restaurant and were disappointed.  Like others have noted, the service was extremely slow even though there were only one or two other tables taken.  The server was very sweet and likable but inexperienced.  Either of these two items would have been forgivable if we enjoyed the food.  However, the \"filet mignon\" kabob was obviously not filet . . . it was a large chunk of dry, very chewy beef, maybe chuck steak.  The lamb was dry.  Even the pita bread was crusty and dry.  These overshadowed the rice and Greek salad, which were both well-prepared.  Although it was nice not having the usual Friday night wait for a table, I would opt for an hour+ wait any evening for a reliable dinner over this restaurant's offerings."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate at Rotana last night, it was horrible! We walked in and there were two tables inside. We were greeted by one gentleman who then pawned us off to the woman behind the bar.   She asked where we wanted to be seated and my boyfriend mentioned sitting on the couches. She responded with \"that is VIP seating\" ok, so there are only two other tables In here?   The decor inside was nice and the tables looked brand new as well.   We asked about happy hour and prices on drinks... She had no idea so we waited for her to come back.....   Our server was running around like a chicken with her head cut off... We waited and we waited and we waited. She finally came over to take our order and then said oh wait I don't have a pen... I was very frustrated at this point because it was 20 minutes after we sat down..my boyfriend ordered us a bottle of wine which also took 20 more minutes. She continued to run around and then grabbed a gentleman from outside who came over to ask us which kind of wine we wanted when we had already told her.   He handed her the bottle of wine and she opened it for us. She brought the wine over to the table and said I'm not sure if I'm supposed to leave the cork inside or outside but here you go! There was a huge chunk of cork inside the wine bottle!   The food finally came and was extremely over salted.    We will not be returning to Rotana or recommending it to our friends, or family"}
{"text":"The place is clean and the servers are nice.   The food was a little lacking in flavor. We had Chicken kaabob, kefta, fries and rice. The chicken was good, needed more marination. The kefta was boring and the rice was horrible, old and dry. The garlic spread they use with the chicken is awesome and very very strong garlic.   I used the yelp deal but the meal only can to $22 so I have a yelp deal to go back. I just am not sure I will. Maybe for the live music???"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Pictures for everything so that helps if your confused on what to order! Joe our sever/ bartender was funny and a very pleasant to talk! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for a long, long time. The husband and I decided to give it a try after a movie date, and ordered takeout.   They were very kind, offering us water while we waited. The restrooms are clean, although I didn't notice any changing tables for babies.   We ordered the chicken shawarma plate, falafels and baba ganouj. The chicken was perfection, with a delicious garlic sauce (super potent! Not first date friendly, but fine for us old married people ). The falafels were donut shaped, which was new to me. They were good, but I wanted some kind of sauce with them or something. The baba ganouj was ok, it could have used maybe a tad more salt?   Food is a bit on the pricier side ($12+) for entrees, and I think $6 something for the dips. Bc of the proximity to my parents house, we will prob eat here again, but not on the regular."}
{"text":"This is our new hot spot in town my wife and I love the service and we feel like family when we go there and the food is the best Middle Eastern food we ever had before not to mention life entertainment it's the best I will definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for the time of their life"}
{"text":"We really like this restaurant. The service is fantastic and the food is really good. If you like brussel sprouts, you should definitely try Rotana's version of the side dish."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Saturday night around 8p. The atmosphere  is hip and new with middle eastern music playing softly. We were greeted immediately  and seated. The staff was very nice. They did say that they do a club like vibe w music after 10 with hookahs. 5 out of 5  We ordered drinks from the bar. The pours were good and not too heavy.    The food was amazing. We ordered and appetizer and I ordered the gyro and gf got the beef shawarna. We enjoyed them both.  We will be back. 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Great food, with an amazing selection.  Service was great also.  Look forward to taking the kids again and trying new things."}
{"text":"We had lentil soup, vegetarian platter and salmon and all was so delicious.   Joe our server was great!  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Coming from NY where Middle Eastern food is abundant and good, it takes some doing to impress me. We stopped in because I like to support neighborhood spots. Nice looking room. They have a full bar with lots of beers.  Heather was our server and she was friendly and very good at her job. The food was excellent, great fresh salad and amazing chicken grilled for kabobs very tender and flavorful. My companion had a beef Schwarma loaded with meat and pickled veggies. I will definitely come back at night for lamb or salmon and try all the other delicious Mid Eastern stuff like hummous and baba Ganoush and other more exotic dishes that are less common on the menu as well. Great find! Not expensive and big portions... love it"}
{"text":"I had purchased a Yelp deal for here. My daughter and I went for lunch on a Sunday at around 11:30. Walked in and there were no customers - we were told they had changed there Sunday hours and did not open until 1 pm! The manager said to come in and they would still serve us anyway - I thought this was very accomidating! Both the food and service were very good - more than enough food for the 2 of us to share and still have leftovers."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Love the live music. The owner does everything, he sings, smoozes the guests, keeps an eye on the place and keeps the vibe going. Even though me and my friend Stephen were the only white people here, it was so much fun!!! Best hookah bar in az by far!!!"}
{"text":"OK we purchased the Groupon drove all the way up to try this place to see if they are as good as advertised. Found out at the door they do not want to honor any Groupon's. Who puts out a coupon and then decides not to honor it anymore?  Would it have been better to just honor the coupon instead of making the customer get back online to demand a refund?"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Been a regular for 6 months . Food is always available on time. I generally do take out. Love this place. Try the special rice with the fried onions on top and the gyro anything! People are too hard on this place. I don't get it."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I stopped by here one night for dinner. I was Leary because I have never heard of this place before and I usually only eat at large chains. We were greeted at the door and seated immediately, the restaurant was completely dead except for us. Although a group came in while we were seated and it was 800 on a Thursday.  We were given drinks and menus very quickly, the waiter was very nice and patient as we had questions about the different dishes (I had never eaten Mediterranean food before). We ordered the chicken kabobs and steak kabobs, the dishes were wonderful! So delicious!! I know we will be back again for more delicious food and excellent service. I would recommend that everyone tries this restaurant as it has all you need for a romantic dinner, great food, great atmosphere and fabulous service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Fillet and lamb was amazing. Can't go wrong with the pita bread and hummus. The baklava for desert, tasted fresh not frozen. Had an amazing 3 course meal with a beer during a hookah sesh listening to good music. This is an all in one - MUST TRY - restaurant. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. The meat was nice and tender. The hummus was really good. Nice food presentation and really tasty. The service was friendly and prompt. We will go again."}
{"text":"It's mid-October 2015 and they're finally open!  Went in the other afternoon and had the chicken shwarma plate. The chicken was good, though maybe it could have used a little more spice. It came with bread and garlic butter. I would go back just for that butter! It had enough garlic to give it a bite, and it could quickly become addictive.   I'll definitely be trying them again."}
{"text":"Nice new Mediterranean place. We ordered the chicken shawarma and kebab platter for two. Fresh food. The shawarma was excellent. Kebabs were decent for Arizona. Have a full bar. We did take out. Staff was friendly. Humus was excellent"}
{"text":"We drove to Rotana Mediterranean Grill last night for dinner in great anticipation with our $20 Groupon voucher, and were informed that they do not accept any coupons -- apparently the ownership changed the day before, and declared they will not honor! We were really looking forward to dinner after reviewing their website, and it was quite a drive. We told them it was the only way we would have ever even known the restaurant existed, and were tempted to go somewhere else. Seems like they need the advertising b/c at normal dinner hour [7pm] there were only two diners when we arrived. We stayed because it was getting late, but I was disappointed and upset, and advised using these coupons is one way we discover new places that we go back to if the food is good -- but we would not be back because of the new owner's ridiculous decision, and after the meal, based on the food. Not only was the Groupon not accepted, but there were issues and we wouldn't go back even if they had honored the deal. Our server, Steve, was pleasant and did try very hard to please us, but the food was sub-par compared to the beautiful photos posted on their website. First, my glass of \"old\" wine smelled like vinegar, and he brought me another from a new bottle, which was fine. I mentioned that their photos show saffron rice on top of white rice, and was told saffron is very expensive, but that he would request half saffron rice. There was none, only thinly grated carrots on top. The grilled veggies that accompany some dishes are only tomato and onion, but he had the cook add 4 thin slices of burnt zucchini to each plate. The onion was singed on the edge, but basically raw and the tomato was black. I brought both of our onions home and cut them up to use in dinner tonight.  My grilled chicken kabob was not as pictured on the site [small succulent pieces], but huge cuts that had to be cooked too long to be done, and were totally dried out. Mike said his shrimp were okay, but they were overcooked as well, and he had the same issues about the rest of the meal. **We were hungry and looking forward to the nice warm, puffy pita bread [usually w/tzatziki] that is served before meals at any Greek or Mediterranean restaurant. We never got it, so after our meals were delivered, I asked about it, and we were brought cold, flat pitas--I also had to request the tzatziki that comes with most kabob meals. We noted that a table of new guests arrived as we were finishing and had baskets of fresh pita on their table before they even ordered.  Lastly, I was very warm and sweating seated in our corner, and noted they had fans running throughout the entire restaurant above all the empty tables, but not ours. I requested they turn the fans on above us -- said he would, but never did.  All-in-all, a very disappointing dining experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant has only been open a few weeks and I had high hopes, but after dining there one time, I can assure you I will NEVER eat there again. While the restaurant looked decent and had plenty of seating (though there were only two other parties seated during dinner time on a Friday night), and the food was actually good, the experience was a major disappointment.  I'm going to be brief and get straight to the point. Here are the problems we encountered: 1) One server. 2) The door was propped open allowing flies to enter.  3) The menu didn't describe the dishes clearly or list why there were two prices next to each entree. 4) It took ten plus minutes just to get our drinks. 5) After ordering drinks and a hummus appetizer the server came back without the drinks or appetizer and said she needed to take our order now because she needed our menus to give to another table that had just been seated. Note that this now makes four tables filled, two of which are eating. So, our three menus are the only menus they have? 6) We order our dinners and I ask if I can get bell pepper instead of tomato with my chicken kabobs (some of the others do come with bell peppers), to which she replies \"I'll have to ask, but just so you know it does come with hummus and a salad too\". What does that have to do with my request? 7) Thirty minutes later our hummus appetizer comes out. The server says the kitchen kept forgetting and she reminded them multiple times. 8) Our dinners come out the two kabob plates are missing ALL of the veggies they were supposed to come with, the salad was missing, and while my husband's kabob did in fact have the hummus side that it came with, mine had a cup of some sort of garlic spread that was so overpowering I couldn't eat it. 9) We tell her all that is missing and she says that she thought it came out already... How is that? She's the only server! Does she remember bringing it out? She then brings two salads (only one was supposed to come with salad) and a plate of \"grilled\" tomatoes and onions that were actually raw. Completely raw onion. Still no bell peppers in site and my husband's, at the very least, was supposed to come with them. 10) The bill was wrong.   I give them a month before closing the doors. Good food is not enough to make a good restaurant."}
{"text":"They recently opened around 3 months ago. Good food, lots of space. Nice outside dining"}
{"text":"I agree with Marty Z. Joe was a great server & the food is TO-DIE-FOR! Hands-down best baba ganoush ever!!! The prices are great too, especially for Happy Hour. Very nice ambiance as well. This is my new favorite local spot!!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find authentic middle eastern food in Phoenix - unless you come to Rotana. The menu is extensive with everything you could imagine. We started with a Greek salad. Vegetables were fresh, accompanied by feta, olives and fragrant herbed dressing. Next we tried a combination appetizer plate with 3 different hummus dips, baba ghanoush, yogurt, and muhammara accompanied with fresh pita bread. All delicious! The main course was a combo kebab plate with chicken, filet mignon and kafta on a bed of spiced basmati rice. Everything was perfectly marinated and grilled to perfection, each with its own distinct flavor. It was a feast for $50 and we still managed to take half of everything home. Wait staff was very attentive and helpful in ordering. Even though it wasn't busy when we arrived, our waiter said weekends can be packed, but they take reservations. Definitely looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"How do I write this review without sounding so cliche? How do I avoid using those annoying phrases like \"to die for\" and \"the best ever\"? How can I say my words without an over use of exclamation points? (My grammar teacher will snap the ruler against my knuckles!)  Well if I can't say it, give me a canvas so I can paint a picture.  You know that feeling when you have a good thing going? You want to capture THAT exactly as it is and not have one iota change. Well... I want this restaurant to stay open always.  I want that chef to be there forever. I don't want the menu to change ever.  Folks at the table were humming with joy and shimmying to the middle eastern music coming from the wide screens.   I, myself, wanted to crawl into the basket of warm pita bread and hibernate there for the winter. And let me tell you neither a beggar nor borrower I be, but for this review I'm begging you to borrow some cash and support this wonderful restaurant, Rotana. It's Located on Greenway Parkway just past 7th Street and across the drive thru of Wells Fargo.   In all honesty, this is the best Mediterranean food I've eaten. It's to die for!  Whew.  There are multiple veggie options on the menu (full color and pictorial) and although most of them are listed as appetizers, you can easily make a meal out of two items and leave satiated. The dishes we ordered were simple but deliciously filled with an abundance of incredible flavor.   Everything tasted as if it had been made-to-order. I think there was a solo operation going on in the kitchen because our plates came out one at a time. But it's all for one and one for all at our table so even though sharing the first dish was obligatory, as other plates arrived and covered the table in goodness we were all happily chomping on our own dishes and finished eating around the same time.   Here's what the vegetarians ordered:  Hummus - $5.50 Yummy, creamy. Just fancied up with a topping of whole chickpeas, olive oil, and flavor.   Baba Ghanouj - $6.50 The menu says \"smoked to perfection\" and I wholeheartedly agree. The eggplant was perfectly smooth, tasty, topped with tomato garnish, olive oil, and flavor.  M'jadara - $5.00 Lentils with rice, topped with crispy onions and flavor. Normally I would not have liked this dish because the rice was mushy combined with the texture of the lentils, but it was delicious. I actually dug in and ate a few spoonfuls.  If you like beans and rice, order it.  Roasted brussels sprouts - $5.00 Tossed with cranberries. Not crunchy, yet firm. Yeh to firm green veggies. I was impressed with the melange.   Muhammara - $5.50 My first time hearing of this dish. It's a red pepper paste mixed with walnuts. The menu claimed \"spicy red pepper\" and although one person at the table tasted some heat, all I got was a mouthful of saltiness. Too salty for my taste, but I liked it paired with the m'jadara and brussels sprouts.   Fattoush rotana salad - $7.00 Wow. This salad was the most complicated looking dish on the table. Like a kaleidoscope - purple, orange, red, all shades of greens, there may have been yellow too. Piled with several ingredients and topped with fried pita, flavorful dressing, and some delicious seasoning that I've never tasted before.  I. Wanted. To. Lick. The. Salad.  Are you hearing me? Lick. It.  Falafel - $6.00 Thankfully the fritters were not oily, but unfortunately their texture was dry and uneventful. If there exists a falafel spectrum in the universe, it must only read \"dry\" on one end and \"oily\" on the opposite end with nothing in-between because I've only had falafel either dry or oily. Haven't found a restaurant yet that has found a balance. Skip it.  Vegetarian burger - $6.00 An overgrown falafel in burger clothes. Normally that would be okay, but this falafel was dry, so unless you like it like that, skip it."}
{"text":"Won't be going back here. Sat at the bar with my son on a Sunday afternoon and ordered some simple items for lunch. It took forever to get our food and I can't figure out why as the place was empty. The person working the bar was friendly enough and regularly filled our drinks but food took forever and they forgot to bring out the salad I ordered. Next time I'm in the area I will go elsewhere. To bad as it has a nice restaurant and bar area."}
{"text":"Next time I will do carry out at this place - service is poor.  Grilled food and sides are good.  They do not have a liquor license.  Young wait staff try their best but do not have basic service skills.    I never saw them clear plates anywhere - just left dirty plates on every table :(!"}
{"text":"This place is simply a joke. They have zero knowledge of the restaurant business. Hope they turn things around by hiring the right staff. Good luck"}
{"text":"The first few times we've been here the service and food was awesome! The past two times however have been the complete opposite. The food is fantastic which is the only reason why we keep coming back. We know it's not the servers fault, but also are not fans of waiting over an hour for food when there's only 4 other tables of people in the restaurant. From now on we'll only get take out or prepare to wait awhile for food."}
{"text":"I stopped by to grab some takeout here and wished I had time for a sit down meal. Very nice decor. Friendly staff. And by the looks of the bar, I would've enjoyed a cocktail.  The kabobs (beef and lamb) were great and the rice was delicious. I especially loved the taste of the marinade on the beef. I can't wait to take my girlfriend here for a sit down meal to try some of the other dishes. I'll bet they're all good."}
{"text":"Amazing food top touch service. Very friendly. Chef Sam cooks great food.  Our server Ali took really good care of us. Will definitely recommend this restaurant to our friends."}
{"text":"OMG, I don't even know where to begin on this one.  We walked up to the door only to find a sign saying they do not accept Groupons anymore.  As Joe S. said, who does that?  If I hadn't driven out of my way, I never would have stayed.  Everyone should just walk away from a business that does not honor their commitment in the first place.  And in hindsight, I wish I would have done that, because it just gets worse from there.  So we walked in around 7pm, and there was only one other table of customers in the whole restaurant.  The place was very hot as they are probably too cheap to turn up the A/C to cool it properly.  They have extremely high ceilings, so it probably costs too much to keep it comfortable.  Not my problem.  We are served by a very nice guy, but that's the only good thing about the place.  We get our menus and we order.  I only wanted a lamb kebab pita sandwich, but they try to make you buy a whole dinner plate by not offering sandwiches in the evening.  Lucky for me our waiter was nice enough to let me have what I wanted.  We wait about 15 minutes to get our beverages.  Then another 20 or so to get our appetizer.  Keep in mind there's only 2 other customers there, so no idea what took so long.  We actually ordered chicken wings as an app, even tho we thought it was a weird item for a Mediterranean Grill, but it caught our attention.  We ordered them grilled, they came fried.  Then my lamb kebab sandwich showed up.  The meat is dry, overcooked and tasteless.  The tzatziki sauce is nowhere to be found.  The sandwich sauceless.  I asked the waiter to bring out some sauce and he was so embarrassed they had forgot one of the main ingredients of the sandwich.  I felt bad for him.  So I put it on, but it did not help.  It too was tasteless.  Their fountain sodas were also watered down and tasteless.  We suffered through it and couldn't wait to get out of there.  Then, the best thing happened.  A balloon got caught in the ceiling fan, and huge chunks of dust came dropping down on our table.  We immediately got up, asked for the bill and departed quickly.  Made a quick QT stop for some junk food, to get the taste out of our mouths.  Oh yeah, and the bathrooms are pretty terrible as well.  The toilet seat cover holders were empty, one stall was out of toilet paper and there was no hand soap, and overall, they are pretty unsightly.  Needless to say, we won't be going back and I suggest you don't either."}
{"text":"The variety of Lebanese style dishes is fantastic. I especially have been enjoying their lamb dishes. I will definitely be coming back here in the future. The service is nice and you feel like family when you are dining with them. It is also nice to see that they serve wine from Lebanon."}
{"text":"Came here with husband and our offspring. The highchair was clean, which is always a plus.  Food was ok, nothing to write home about. They may have used too many spices and onions for my taste in the kabob dish I ordered.  The place was clean, quiet and the service was friendly and professional. The atmosphere is cool, maybe I need to try another dish. Will come back and give an updated review when I do."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited after New Years. I was disappointed in the beef Kafta Kabob. The meat just did not taste fresh. The plate was served with a not so roasted tomato and a sliver of an onion and not to mention it took over 25 minutes to arrive. It was only warm. One waiter and we were  one of 3 couples. I was really disappointed especially after the great reviews on Yelp!  The entire next 20 minutes we waited for our server to check with us and complete the transaction. My suggestion is to choose Pita Jungle but if you want top quality and great food..Persian Room on Scottsdale Road is still my favorite"}
{"text":"Saw this several times on my way home. Food is Excellent overall.   My Lamb was well done. Not dry But overcooked. Surprisingly the ground lamb/beef shish kabob was outstanding. Superb seasoning over all. My wifes gyro was good a 4 star sandwich.  Service is sub par. I had to go ask for a drink refill. We were the only people in the entire store. The Lamb makes it a 4 star. the service a 2 star. The seasoned food was outstanding so I gave it a 4 in the end."}
{"text":"We got our food to go but loved every bite of it. We had three different kinds of hummus, chicken kabob and lamb kabob wrap."}
{"text":"There gyros are super good! Use Groupon to get a good deal out of them. We pay $10 for $20 deal. It's worth the money"}
{"text":"Fabulous food!  We had the combo kabobs - Meats were very flavorful. They also had great sauces (tahini & a couple of others). The service was great - Ronnie & Heather were super helpful. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"The service  was the best. The food it was so amazing.  I love  the hummus with olive oil. My friends and I enjoyed the atmosphere,  food and service. Even when we where  done we stayed  talking  for an hour and they didn't  rushed us."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food! My wife and I got the babaghanouj as an appetizer, then had the Chicken Swarma plate, and the Rotana's Mixed Kebab. Everything was delicious and the portion sizes were large. They are getting their liquor license in the next couple weeks which will be great to enjoy a beer out on the patio with a hooka. The service was great as well, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A delightful surprise, actually good mix of Armenian and Lebanese food. We went with a salad, appetizers, and a kibbeh. All were good, but they were out of Brussels sprouts, which we'll have to go back and try. The service was friendly even though it was our waitress's first night. This meant she goofed in the billin (in our favor), which meant we had a feast for the price of a groupon. She even gave us another baba, one of the beat in town. The ambience is a bit strange, part Middle Eastern, part sports bar, and part old restaurant. We will return."}
{"text":"I purchased the $15 for $30 Yelp deal last week, it was too amazing of a promotion to pass up.  To sum up my experience, the food was delicious, wholesome, and tasted homemade, but these positives were offset by the lack of customer service. Rotana might work better as a takeout joint for me.  Anyways with $30 to spend, I ordered a 3 course meal for myself:  Course 1 - Vegetarian platter It included dolmeh, babaganouj, hummus. I swapped out tabbouleh for m'jadara, which was a savory lentil rice with caramelized onions. I had it once at Ramadan iftar, and the one at Rotana tasted the same. A little chalky, savory, texture more gritty than brown rice. The babaganouj had strong roasted eggplant flavor that made it very addictive to eat and the hummus was a great creamy and tangy dip to accompany the toasted pita (which was not served cold out of a package like at fast food joints). The hummus had a heavier garlic taste than I expected, but I did not mind, it was fresh. Here, the dolmeh were served warm, kind of odd for grape leaves which were not stuffed with meat. They're still juicy and olive oil seemed to be its dominant flavor. The menu indicated the mezze should include falafels, but I did not receive any.  Course 2 - Kufta kebab Very similar taste to Persian koobideh, but thankfully not overcooked like the way Persian chefs tend to do. Unfortunately, the accompanying basmati rice was a turnoff because it reminded me too much of a Persian preparation. I was disappointed since Rotana is a Lebanese restaurant. If this restaurant is serious about serving Lebanese food, they should serve kebab dishes with a traditional vermicelli/lentil rice.  Course 3 - Rice pudding When the rice pudding was presented in a martini glass, I didn't think Rotana was serious about their desserts, but it turned out to be spectacular. It was very thick like Greek yogurt and had a lingering sweet floral flavor that tasted amazing with bitter ground pistachio.  The rice pudding even had a small crust around the edge. This dessert tasted homemade and was very similar to the Afghan sheer birenj that I had before.  The service during my visit was not very good. I came on a Sunday night and my server was inside the kitchen for most of the time. This restaurant seemed to practice the American-style of service, where each server is responsible for a set of tables, although another server was available he refused to take my order. Too bad the quality of service was not up to the American standards though. I think that servers should refill waters promptly and be readily available instead of camping inside the kitchen for whatever reason."}
{"text":"If you like Mediterranean food you have to check this place out. It's only been open for about a month. They have a great menu with a lot more items than you usually will find in a Mediterranean restaurant. Great selection of items. Another great thing about their menu is they have pictures of everything!  That always helps and of course the pictures on Yelp.  Service was great, friendly and attentive.  I went there for lunch and use the $15 for $30 Yelp coupon.  What a great deal! Recommendation of the server I got the fried cheese which was wrapped in a thin pastry. I forgot what they call it was excellent.  Crunchy on the outside and cheesy goodness on the inside.  The hummus was also excellent.  I also tried the chicken Shawarma, also good.  They let me substitute Armenian Salad instead of rice.  Brussel sprouts also were good.  They came with walnuts because they were out of cranberries.    They have a full bar and happy hour from 3 to 7pm.   Nice decor.  Last time I was in this place it was Chuy's and it is more upscale now."}
{"text":"We have gotten excellent carry out on several occasions. I recently ordered a last minute carry out order for 17 people, and the server (I think his name was Steve) really helped me decide the right amount of food. And let me tell ya, he was right on the money. The we ordered (hummus, baba gannosh, grape leaves, chicken and beef shwarma, and fattoush and Greek salad). Everything was amazing.   We grew up in Detroit eating middle eastern food, so we are picky and Rotana is the real deal."}
{"text":"It is no surprise that this place is locked and chained.  I try not to review a restaurant after one visit, but after spending $40 on my first - worst meal in Phoenix - ever; I could't bring myself to throw good money after bad.  This past week-end I needed to be in the area and so decided to give it another try, maybe just an app or two; and behold the place was vacant ; and chained from the outside.  Another tenant in the complex indicated the landlord chained the doors as the owner seems to have just abandoned the business.  On my first visit, the proprietor came by, I was the only person in the restaurant - which should have been my first clue; and asked me how everything was; I told him it was the worst meal I'd had in Phoenix; and the worst Lebanese food I had ever had, anywhere. He replied; \"yeah, we're firing the chef tomorrow; come back and give us another try.\"!!!!!  The hostess saw me photographing the food (to post);  it was literally gray in color; and asked me for my driver's license!  I hope those people who purchased Groupon and restaurant.com certificates get their money back.  Someone made a large capital investment in this place; nice looking inside, numerous wide screen TVs, big patio.  Let's hope that in its next incarnation, the food does justice to the surroundings."}
{"text":"I was heading toward a fast food restaurant's drive through when I passed this restaurant.  I did a U-turn and had lunch here instead.  The chicken shawarma wrap was so much tastier than any fast food I could have ordered.  The baba ganouj I took home was a delightful addition to dinner.   Why should I settle for mediocre fast food at lunch when I can get great food and attentive service for a very reasonable price?  I also hope to check out their live music and belly dancing in the future."}
{"text":"What great food! A great new restaurant and in my area.. Joe was the server and he did an outstanding job! Super excited about Mediterranean food in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this restaurant several times on my way home, so thought I would stop by tonight. I was greeted immediately by Ramin, who was friendly and welcoming. The interior is clean and well designed. I loved the music they played.  I ordered an iced tea - which, for me, is a test for all Arizona restaurants. It was delicious and Ramin kept my glass full throughout my meal.  I asked Ramin for a recommendation and he suggested the chicken shawarma. It was excellent and served with rice, hummus, and a salad. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice.  The food and the service have been excellent.  This version of (since they reopened under new owners) the restaurant is much better than the earlier one.  Not too busy yet but that should change soon."}
{"text":"The manager of this restaurant, \"Steven C.\", sent me a message on yelp!, calling me an \"idiot\" for the review I wrote about Rotana. The reason I know this person is the manager, is because when I called to place my order my first time ordering from them, the person who answered was a man named Steven. This was the same person that answered when I called to fix my order. I do not appreciated being called an idiot by someone that I gave money to! It is completely inappropriate an unacceptable that a manger of an establishment would call someone a name online because they didn't write a 5 star review for their restaurant. I will NEVER be back to Rotana, and maintain my original review and photos I posted.   Beware of Rotana and the manager Steven. I hope my updated review influences enough people to not support a local business that calls customers derogatory names through the very site we use to state our opinions."}
{"text":"My wife and myself stopped by yesterday evening to place a \"to go\" order.  We enjoy eating mediterranean food and wanted to give this place a try since they haven't been open very long.  When we walked into the restaurant, we were greeted by the server who directed us to the bar and gave us menus.  We placed our order for the Shwarma Beef & Chicken Entree & the Appetizer Sampler which include Falafel, Hummus, Baba ganoush, and Fatoosh.  We sat at the bar and watch the cooks prepare our food, which was cooked fresh.  While waiting for our food, the owner of the restaurant greeted us and gave us the history behind the name of the restaurant.  He also talked about the origin of some of the dishes and told us about the flat bread baking oven he had shipped from out of the country.  The owner was a very nice and engaging gentleman.  We received our order in about 20 minutes. I must say, the flavor of the food was great!  The portion sizes was enough to feed two people and we had left overs.  We will definitely return and support this new restaurant."}
{"text":"I used a spend $15 get $30 coupon and it was worth way more than $30! I definitely recommend the appetizer sampler to start."}
{"text":"Service was good Shawarma was average. I'd've had much better. The kicker was $1.50 charge for water. Seems like the ultimate cheap move to me."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is amazing! Best Mediterranean food I've EVER had in my life and I eat many places. The portions , the quality, the flavor and service were all beyond my expectations. I take my hats off to these guys for making my taste buds explodes classic dishes like gyro plates with basmati rice and chicken kabobs. Both meats were well seasoned and juicy... I'm honestly a customer for life and I will let people know to go here. Compliments to the chef and to the nice waitress expecting a child . You guys made me and my daughter's night!  Sorry about the broken glass cup my daughter dropped ! You guys handled it very professional and I respect that more than you guys know.   Go! Go! Go!"}
{"text":"Really good food, have had a gyro and schwarma now and both were delicious! Different flavoring from what I've had before and very good.   Nice people/good service too!"}
{"text":"We accidentally went here last night and ended up being there on a night where they had a special show and were totally book. Despite being booked for an event the owner got us a table and was very very kind. We ended up getting to see a really cool belly dancing/drum show that we had not even been planning on! (They do cool events every third Friday!)   Appetizers: I had the Greek salad. My partner had the baba ghanoush.The salad was huge. The baba ghanoush was super smooth and had a great smokey flavor.   Main Course: Kafta kababs and chicken kababs. Both were very good.   As we left the owner stopped us at the door to thank us for coming and asked us to come back. We had a great time. Next third Friday we will be! (We'll make a reservation next time!)"}
{"text":"This place is really good. They haven't even done a grand opening and this place is already looking good, the hookah is excellent and the food is great. Hope they keep up the good job!"}
{"text":"I had lived down the street from this place for over a year before I decided to try it. The Yelp deal got my wife and I in the door, but their food keeps us coming back at least a few times per month.   The food here is always great and reasonably priced. We're big Mediterranean food fans and this place hits the spot. The huge selections of items gives us plenty of variety (we normally just order a few shared appetizers). I also love that their menu has a good description AND picture for every item. Helpful for making a decision on something you've never heard of or tried.  Staff is always nice and friendly. Place is clean and always has had seating. I think they have live music on friday/saturday nights, which is a neat offering."}
{"text":"This place has really good quality food for a reasonable price. On top of that, the staff is super helpful and friendly. I like that the menu has pictures and good descriptions of the ingredients because a lot of the food is obscure to the majority of Americans. I mean, they say \"Meditteranean Cuisine,\" but there are other things like Armenian sausages. Hummus and Boba Ganoush were awesome. Likewise, the steak wrap I had was filled to the brim with meat and totally stuffed me for the price. Neat place. I see some people had problems with Groupons, but I had no problem with the yelp coupon I purchased a year ago."}
