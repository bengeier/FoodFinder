{"text":"I get delivery from this restaurant sometimes, but only because everywhere else is closed. 

Unless you plan on ordering three hours before you want your food, then you will be severely disappointed waiting for your food."}
{"text":"Tastes great, amazing food, quick service. But they do NOT follow their \"Open\" hours. Very inconvenient..

Just an update; they have changed titles and ownership- they now go by Chile Noodle. This review does NOT apply to the new location- I haven't been there yet."}
{"text":"Lunch may be crowded and a bit slow as they get organized, but at dinnertime last Saturday, the restaurant was empty.  I've eaten here twice now and think it's a great find.  We had the sushi boat.  There was more than enough for two and all of it was super-fresh and delicious. 
Park right around the corner on the side street.  ."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting, waited 45 mins to even get our waters,  and my pas thai tasted like it came frozen out of a carton from trader Joe's.  Not good."}
{"text":"Well I never even got my food after ordering it for delivery so if its possible i'd give them zero stars, i ended up letting eat24 so that i didn't get charged"}
{"text":"I ordered Red Curry with beef from the lunch specials.  It had lots of fresh vegetables, good quality beef, and a delicious red curry sauce that was just the right level of spicy (I ordered a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10).  My friend had chicken pad thai (spicy = 9), which she said was very good.  The space is pleasant and clean, and there are lots of booths.  My only issue is that with a fairly busy (not packed) dining room, there seemed to be only one waitress and she was quite busy.  We had a bit of a delay in getting our check.  Hopefully they will increase the staffing a bit to account for the downtown lunch rush."}
{"text":"I have had this place on my \"must try\" list for a while now and decided today was the day. When I walked through the door my first impression was \"Wow, it's a lot larger on the inside than I thought it was.\" There was a bit of a crowd and at first I was going to wait to be seated but then I noticed that there was nobody at the bar so I parked myself there. I should add right here that yes, Thai Hana does have a bar but they do not stock it with any alcohol or beer. That was fine by me since I was on my lunch break and wasn't planning on drinking anything stronger than water anyway.

I was attended to right away with a menu and a glass of water with a lemon slice. A few moments later I ordered the Chicken Pad Woon Sen. It didn't take long afterwards for a salad to be placed in front of me. The salad consisted of some lettuce, cabbage and carrot strips dressed in a flavorful, slightly spicy, slightly vinegary, pasty texture dressing. I really liked the salad, the veggies were very fresh and crisp. Included on the side of the salad was one lone crisp on the outside, warm on the inside, crab ragoon. 

I suppose it took about five or six minutes for the Pad Woon Sen to be served. It was a healthy portion that was visually appealing with a flower shaped carrot on the side. The spices, heat and flavors blended well with each other.  All said it was a very tasty lunch. 

The bill came to $9.01 including tax, minus tip. As I was walking back to the office afterwards I was trying to determine if I thought that this place was as good as Nicky's Thai a few blocks away. They are both Thai cuisine and similar in that regard, but there were subtle differences between them such as the salad dressing, the presentation of the food, the overall layout and decor of the restaurant, etc.. I'm going to call it a Thai for now and say that you'd be happy with either choice. Maybe after a few more visits to each I'll come up with a clear and defined winner."}
{"text":"good pad tai. wanton soup was relish. crab Rangoon was awesome would go back for sure."}
{"text":"This gem just opened up a month ago. Sister restaurant to the one in Oakland (I've never been). 

We both ordered Pad Thai (8 spicey) and Tom Yum Soup. FANTASTIC! Love seeing amazing food at very affordable prices, but even better to see it so close to where we live downtown. 

A few things people may have contention with: the sushi bar is currently closed (but it's a Thai restaurant sooo...who cares?) and it is BYOB, which is fine because I have plenty of B I don't mind B'ing. That was really just a PSA for those who would like to know. If it changes I will update. 

My recommendation: Don't pass this place up. It has a bit of class, and a whole lot of flavor!

(Just kidding about the \"who cares\" . Could always use another sushi bar, but it doesn't affect my score one bit!)"}
