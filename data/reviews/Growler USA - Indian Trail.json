{"text":"This is one of my wife's favorite new restaurants.  Everything we have tried from the menu has been top notch.  I have visited on multiple occasions and tried the same menu item again.  Food quality and presentation have been consistent.  Wait staff have been variable but on the good side, really depends on experience.  They are always friendly and attentive.  The Operator has been out to chat with us and other patrons; he seems genuinely interested in feedback and pleasing the customer.  On to the drink menu...it does change depending upon availability-seasonal brews, what they can get from their suppliers, and of course the popular items can sell out.  If you ask, they will tell you what has sold out.  Sometimes they have beer and ciders that are not on the menu and may offer a sample.  The beer and cider list is extensive and ever changing.  Has a spacious outdoor patio.  Good for friends and family."}
{"text":"While this pub has an outstanding beer selection and a decent menu, go for the beer not the food.  Our service was very poor, delivered by an inexperienced server who managed to slowly get more wrong than right.  When one of the owners came by to ask about our meals, we let him know both our meals were not what was ordered.  His response was, i will talk to the kitchen.  No offer to correct the problems or comp, he blamed inexperienced help at the table and the kitchen.  Save your dollars for a better meal elsewhere then stop by for a beer."}
{"text":"Turkey melt was exceptional and the bacon was like ham steak strips of perfection. Full robust flavor. Tots were perfectly light and crispy and the aioli dip was smooth heat without too much. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Still sitting here, waited 30 min to get a growler filled.  Bar tender filled 4 other drink orders, took a table of 7's order, then took an order over the phone.  My growler was sitting full, going stale on the bar the entire time.  Oh, and was overpriced."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a small bite before a movie.  We will definitely be back! Most delicious Buffalo Chicken Tenders I've had in years! Hubby had the Turkey Melt which was also phenomenal! Great service. Just needs a little more attention to cleanliness (not terrible just needs improvement)."}
{"text":"I happened to come across this Bar while catching a movie. The fries are to die for! The Kiwi Blonde Ale is one of the best beers I've tried a long time. The food is fresh, service is good. I met the owners and they are very friendly and looking to make this best beer place in town. Don't miss. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Beer in the Charlotte area. The Beer selection is good, the food is great and the service is awesome! Don't miss this place.   My recommendations - The Hummus appetizer, the Pretzel and the Kiwi Blonde Ale."}
{"text":"The service at this location is terrible.  We were seated immediately on Saturday evening as the restaurant was not busy at all - that should have been our first clue. We waited about 15 minutes or so to place drink orders and were provided a bottle of room temp water and glasses.  After waiting 30 minutes on our beers, we were thankful for the water.  Our waiter was nowhere to be found so twice went to the bar to check on 3 beers and a soda.  They finally brought the drinks to the table but one was wrong - they have over 50 beers on tap which looks impressive but they were not knowledgeable on the selections.  We never saw them ID anyone, including my daughter who just turned 21.  By this time, we had been there almost an hour and our wings never showed up.  We questioned the manager at this point and were told they were out of BBQ sauce - had they let us know 30 min earlier we would've changed sauces.  We cancelled the order. In the meantime, two other parties simply left without being served and another woman heard our complaints as she was leaving and said the same thing happened to her and told the manager she'd never be back.   The wait continued as two separate customers returned their takeout orders for being incorrect. We stood to pay for our drinks and search for dinner elsewhere just as our food arrived at our table. We had spoken with the manager multiple times by this point and he comped our food so we sat down to eat. Of course, two of four orders were wrong. My salad arrived five minutes after everyone else's - it lacked any sort of flavor but I did eat a few bites. The burgers were decent but the chicken & waffles were tasteless and the chicken was overcooked.   Two and a half hours later we left after paying for our drinks. They were not short staffed and not overwhelmed by customers (except by the multiple complaints).  This place is simply mismanaged and the staff is untrained. The restaurant itself was nicely decorated, the menu looked promising and the beer selection was impressive. Perhaps they should elect to serve beer and snacks and forget the food.  I will say the manager was very apologetic and the staff was constantly apologizing to the patrons.    There are other locations in the Charlotte area; however, after this experience, I will never be dining at any of them.   I can't imagine this place will be open much longer in Indian Trail."}
{"text":"One star would be the best I could give this place. This, by far, was the most disappointing meal I have ever had. We we're so looking forward to it and it could not have been any more of a disappointment than it was. Wife and daughter where at a play so my son and I went. Wow.  Can't believe they could possibly have any repeat customers. We seated ourselves and waited 10 minutes before a very nice, but totally clueless waitress came over. She whipped out her tablet 15 minutes after her first appearance  to take our order and had zero clue how to use it.  After i interjected to help her figure out what we actually ordered, as it was pretty intuitive, our order was taken.    15 minutes later, she passed our table and I had to ask for my beer which was ordered 15 before. 20 minutes later, no food. We ordered wings as an appie.   I ordered a cup of soup and a wrap. My son the blt.   I saw another family seated 20 minutes after we got there.  You could tell by looking at them, that they, like us were ready to walk out. Finally, about 40 minutes after we ordered they like brought the wings, my son's blt  and my wrap. What? All at once?  Yep. Then, 10 minutes later, out pops my soup.  Huh?  The guy who brought it apologized by saying \"sorry, I don't even work here.  I'm a friend of the owners\"  Yeah, well, where the hell was the owner?  Anyway, the guys said they'd take it off our bill...they didn't. About 5 minutes later, the son from the other table had to go to the bar to ask for his beer. We ate and left. 2+ hours for 2 beers, wings,  soup and sandwhiches in a very noncrowded restaurant. The other family was there for an hour when we left and had gotten 1 round of drinks.  No food or anything else. But They, like us, got a ton of apologies. Our server was very nice, just clueless and there was no manager or anyone else with any idea how to run a retail food place there.   It was flat out awful. I guess food if you have an hour to go get 1 beer. Too bad. So close to home, such a good food and beer menu. Fries are great. But there is just about no way I would go back. This place needs a new owner and someone behind the scenes who knows what they are doing. The one in Ballantyne is 100x better so this location is just dragging down the name. I would be embarrassed if I was the owner or anyone in management. Or, they should be let go."}
{"text":"Great selection and very attentive service. Everyone is friendly and knows their stuff. Food looks good too. Still waiting on specials (grand open on 29th). Hope prices go down, too. Most full pour brews are a dollar too much. Did some cross checking and Temp Mojo has them beat. Had to look hard to fine brews at 5 bucks FFP."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! Lots of beer choices and a good variety from different areas! I got a flight so I could try a few different ones! I had the buffalo dip as my meal and it was super tasty! Super excited to see there is one of these opening in Virginia because I'd definitely go again! Basic bar food but everything I saw looked as good as the buffalo dip! The bartenders were friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was great for gameday. I especially loved that the bathrooms have the TV audio on the speakers so you don't have to miss a moment of the game! Highly recommend. Will definitely go again if I'm ever back in this area and for sure going to check out the location opening on VA soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I thought we found a great place to spend our date nights. We had been to this location, 3 weeks in a row, prior to this visit. We were attracted to the Monday special of $3.50 pints. I enjoy local drafts while my wife enjoys the ciders. The past 3 Mondays we haven't had a problem, in fact our server was fantastic, even while she was training a new employee.   This visit was quite the opposite. We sat down and ordered straight away, we order a beer and cider. The server was nice but not very attenative. Once the bartender had poured our drinks, it sat on the bar for 10 minutes before they were brought to us. Our server was hanging out at the bar and interacting with other guests while our drinks were getting warm. We spent around 45 minutes in which she seldom came by to check up on us. We were wanting to order another beer but decided not to since our service was slow. I asked for the check, as she went to get it she stopped back by the table she was at previously and chatted some more, before she returned with the bill.  After reviewing the check, I noticed we had been charged full price for our drinks. I asked about it and she responded \"only certain pints are on special and ciders are not included\". That was not the case with our previous visits. She was kind enough to adjust it, but this will be our last visit. They need to make it clear what drinks are on special. It reminded me of the carnival game where you pick up the rubber ducks that are floating around and look at the bottom to see if you won a prize. It's misleading and very unproffesional."}
{"text":"The good the bad the ugly,...Good.. Steven was serving me and my wife and had good knowledge of beers on tap and great recommendations of food, and the food was pretty good. Bad..beer on tap is not very cold, cold beer sales..remember..cold beer sales..I would suggest turning down the cooler a few degrees, 35 maybe...beer is a little on the warm side of my likings..The Ugly...I'm all for introducing pet friendly patios, however the waitress serving the patio was petting and playing with a dog and serving and never once did I see her enter the restroom to wash her hands, dog even came inside the restaurant running around..NOT COOL. Health department would like to hear that either...also what appeared to be off the clock employees several at the end of the bar, watching TV, one goes back and turns up what they're watching to a point it was louder than all TV's so I really couldn't hear the dodgers astro game, and one of the kids with cornrows in his hair lying over the bar watching TV twisting his corn rows and scratching his head all over top of where someone eats..for some time...pretty nasty...kitchen help seemed to be friends with them because the kitchen help spent most of his time talking and BSn with them...a place of business isn't where I like to see a hangout for friends, not when I'm looking for a dinner...Not happy on the hygiene however Steven my server/tender was good and food was good...but none of it matters if it's not clean...this is just what I saw...wonder what I didn't see in the back??"}
{"text":"Great beer selection including local breweries like my favorite out of Monroe, Southern Range.  The Ahi Tuna is fresh as are the salads.  Gretchen, the manager is on top it it!  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot. It's the new place on the block in a very busy & established sun valley plaza. The hot wings unreal. So good they should be advertising them. I like the growler concept, kinda wish they had more beer size options that aren't growlers. 100 beers on taps, flights available."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Awesome food and a very vast selection of beer. Their beer sampler \"Flight\" is probably the best way to try as much as you want without having to fill your belly up too much."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, horrible service and so noisy I could not hear my companion speaking.  We had been wanting to try this place for a few weeks and finally got the chance. The decor is a mixture of rustic garage and airport. There are LCD screens with the beer menu on it behind the bar which is reminiscent of the flight boards you see at airports but it's helpful, a cement floor and unfinished ceiling, with a few old timey tin and wood signs here and there. The flooring and unfinished ceilings make it so loud and echoey that you cannot have a conversation with someone. It was during lunchtime and there were 8 other patrons there. Four at the bar, two at a table adjacent to us, and two at a table behind us.  It should not have made hearing what my companion was saying impossible, but it did. We ordered some samples of beer(very cool and kinda fun) and our meal. The samples seemed to take longer than it should have but at least they arrived before the food. When the food came, we asked for our beers and if we could have some utensils and napkins. We thought the waitress would bring both to us rather soon. We were wrong. When she remembered, she did apologize for not already having or beer on the table and instead of getting them right away, she went to another table and took an order from them. Now you'd think that she's gonna get our beer and utensils cause our foods going cold right? Nope. She went to another table to take their order too. We asked again for the utensils and beer. This time she went straight to the bar and ordered the beer and came back with the utensils and napkins. Whew! We can eat now!  The food was very good. I had a Reuben and my companion had a burger. We ate half the food before it went totally cold, but didn't have the beer we had ordered yet. We didn't have anything to drink at all. I spied our beer sitting on the bar. Our waitress is young. Not yet 21 she told us. Probably not very experienced and new to this waitress thing. I couldn't wait any longer. I got up, went to the bar, got the beer, and went to my table to finish my now barely warm meal.  We really enjoyed the food, but probably won't go back. I cannot describe to my satisfaction how loud it was. It was the finishing touch to an already bad experience. It was so loud and distracting that after we asked each other \"what?\" at least 20 times, we gave up and ate in silence. After 32 years a meal in silence isn't too bad, but it's not what we went there for and thinking back, we should have walked out after the samples.  This establishment has potential. But as long as you're going deaf while not being served it's not worth the time."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Waited 30min before being served after being seated. Waited another 30min for drinks order. It was a quite evening, so not super busy. We walked out after over an hour of no drinks and a terribly argumentative manager who barks at his friendly servers. This place has great potential. It's a shame really. I will never go back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out on a Sunday afternoon. We arrived and sat at the bar. There were a total of 5 other customers in the place. We waited almost 5 minutes for a 'server' to speak to us. There were 2 and they both were outside on the patio. I think we interrupted their outside time. I wanted to try some new options and got a flight. This was a huge mistake. I was handed a piece of paper and pen and told to write down what I wanted. It got worse from there. There is too much competition nowadays to treat customers like they are bothering you to be there."}
{"text":"After an hour and a half our dinner still hadn't arrived, asked for our check and left with only having a beer and apps.  It was the first week they were open and they were severely understaffed.  Place has potential, they just have to get their act together.  Figured for opening week they would have all hands on deck."}
{"text":"We tried this place when it first opened and thought it was worth checking out again months later. I'm only giving it two stars because our server was attentive and very sweet.  We ordered the ballpark pretzels & they came out hard as a rock and obviously microwaved on what you could chew. 25% off was offered because of that.  We saw two advertisements for $3.50 pint night.  One on the chalk board walking in and one on a laminated weekly special list.  When we get our bill, we were charged $7 for the pints and then find out its only a select few pints that applies to.  That was never highlighted or mentioned and a very misleading \"special\".  We paid for our bill and wont ever return."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went in about a week ago bartender with blonde hair was awful. Everytime i needed something she wasn't around. None of the servers could get me what i needed. Bartender was loud and rude to the servers when they asked for beers for customers. Food was terrible also,i assume the bald man that came from the kitchen was the chef. Will not be back unless new bartender."}
{"text":"Terrific place to sample some great local brews. Food is good and and they fill growlers. They are a little expensive but conveniently a good place to stop before or after a movie."}
{"text":"Great place! So many great craft beers to choose from. Loved the decor, and the bartender was outstanding! Very attentive! They give you a water which I really appreciated and it was always full! Think we found our \"spot\"! =)"}
{"text":"This place has a good selection of beers and the staff was friendly, but that is about all the good things I can say. The glassware was dirty and the servers were disorganized and were not knowledgeable about beer. We asked for a sample and it came out in a cracked glass. We ordered food against our best judgement because it seemed overpriced. When the side salad came out it was three tomatoes, some shredded cheese, and several pieces of lettuce were rotten. We told the server and asked them to cancel our food order. They apologized but didn't offer to comp our beers or make it right. Needless to say we will not be returning or recommending. This is sad because this area is in need of a good beer spot."}
{"text":"Why did you close at 9:30 on a Wednesday when your hours clearly state that you close at 10 pm? Glad Hickory Tavern stays open!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I have been waiting for in Sun Valley, let me explain my rating: Food 5 stars- typical bar food selection but quality over delivers.  It's not cheap but you get what you pay for. Service 1 star- unbelievably slow, every visit so far has been a challenge just to get a beer. I suggest being ready to order as soon as the server shows up because you may not see them again for 15 minutes. Even when the place is slow there is no sense of urgency in to service the guests.  It's only been open for a few weeks so I will give them a break and hope that the training gets better, the management team seems to be on the same page though as the servers. Ambiance 3 stars- exactly what you might expect, I was surprised at the level of music, very quiet inside. The outside area needs umbrellas, it is simply a patio with wired tables and chairs. Nothing special. Selection 4 stars- plenty to keep you busy, I will see how they rotate new items in"}
{"text":"Tv's , beer, and meh food. If either of the two prior to food is your goal-you win! I however wanted food with my evening and I was sorely disappointed-twice. Yea, I came here again-glutton for punishment.   Storefront in Sun Valley Mall with the movie theater on Monroe Rd. Could have been a great stop before or after a movie. It is for beer.   Casual dress, private parking lot."}
{"text":"There is a great selection but the service is AWFUL. We have been here for 30 mins...took our drink order but no drinks. There is a minor who could be serving food but instead the bartender is serving food."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with 100 taps... you are sure to find a beer you like.  You can't find this many taps in this area. They have fantastic specials. Come in on Monday for buy one get one free burgers... and get the 1 pounders... you won't be disappointed. And you will leave full."}
