{"text":"The frybread is a must try very good and really big enought for 2 people."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place.  Everything is delicious.   So much food for such a great price.  I love the enchiladas.  Even the fry bread bean and cheese taco is delicious!  Go here, it's great."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Fresh, hot and not greasy. Wide variety and reasonable prices. The people are super friendly. A new favorite for sure."}
{"text":"Five stars so it can be seen. I use to come to this place a lot even when they were at the swapmart. They had the same cooks for about 23 years. I came in here not so long ago but I noticed it a tad bit odd that the two sisters were no longer there. Without them food just isn't the same. Oddly one day as I was passing by I saw a frybread place and had to stop by. I was so shocked when I got there and saw the ANGELINA cooks! They opened up their own restaurant! Unbelievable! Perfect busy little spot. Outside seating, friendly staff, super clean, even has a drive thru window for fast on the go! Super delicious!! Super fast service!! They'll even take orders for any event! Highly recommend the cooks place, maria's frybread and mexican food located on 40st and thomas, 40 palms plaza. A bit hidden but find the yellow van and you'll know you're in the right place. Across the street from wss!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing !  Stopped by to try it out and was pleasantly surprised. Feels like I'm sitting in my own home. We will absolutely be back !"}
{"text":"The sizes are very big and the food is very tasty. Their chicken tacos are awesome and the green chili is really good. The fried bread is really really good. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Omg stopped in here tonight with pregnacy cravings(after seeing great reviews on yelp....They were beat!!! Ironically we did not get fry bread,but had ckn chimi,carne asada burro and son ate a regular ckn burro ench.style.Portions are huge!Everything was delicious.Can't wait to go again for fry bread.Keep up the good cooking and nice service."}
{"text":"Exceptionally clean. Exceptionally friendly staff. Delicious food. 
Much better than fry bread house"}
{"text":"Came by here today to try this place and they were closed 2 hours before posted time."}
{"text":"First time here with the family and we were all pleased. Great food, friendly service, awesome portions.  This will be on the list of regular regular stops, lucky for me it's close enough to both work and home"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Super clean inside.  Friendly owners and employees.  The meatiest tacos on the planet.  I love fry bread and I'm so happy that I found this place."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a little while now, but it always seemed to be on Monday when I thought about it, but I finally remember and went yesterday. I loved it, talk about huge portions my bf got the lunch special which was half a open faced with choice of a meat served with rice and a drink. This was packed full with beans and lettuce and was just delicious. His brother got the same thing and I got a red beef tamale. I wanted room for the dessert!! I got a plain fry bread and they serve it just plain and you can add all the goodies you like. Honey and extra powder sugar is my way. We got all that food for $23 that's pretty incredible to me. The staff was very helpful and friendly this being my first time they helped me out. Also I got some candy that I haven't had since I was s kid. Can't wait to come back here! What a great local establishment!!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING and your order is out so quick that by time you're done paying it's out! The only reason I gave four stars is because they are a bit over priced. But it's obviously worth it because I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This a great place! I enjoy eating here when I'm too tired to make dinner. The people that work here are always helpful. Chips and salsa are good while you wait for your order. The fry bread is great, but if you like spicy food the cheese crisp with hot green chilies has a nice nice kick to it."}
{"text":"A most tasty and mouth watering dish is awaiting you here at Angelas fry bread. They have great salsa and small, medium or large fry bread with all sorts of toppings and the price is medium but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ a week ago and had to try some authentic fry bread! This place was amazing, The decor was so kitschy but adorable! The food was off the wall amazing, it was the type of Mexican food that you wanted more of and didn't have indigestion or wicked heart burn after consuming. Loves the chicken fry bread taco and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"What a gem!  The fry bread taco with green chili beef was fabulous, equal to the friendly service.  This will be my go-to place when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had the chorizo breakfast burrito enchilada style, explosion of awesome all up in my face!"}
{"text":"It had been a while since I had some fry bread as the only place in California I knew of closed down years ago. We decided to try Angelinas out as it had some great reviews. Location is small but very welcoming. My brother and I each ordered 2 fry bread tacos with Asada and Shredded beef. The gentleman taking our order seemed surprised that we were each ordering 2 tacos.  When we received our order we knew why. The tacos were massive and we're stuffed with refried beans, meat and tons of cheese. Our table was sorrounded by these delicious creations and everyone looked at us like we were members of Man vs Food. The fry bread tacos were outstanding.  The fry bread was nice and crunchy. The beans and meat also had a great taste and the cheese topped off the deliciousness.  After 1 taco we were stuffed so we threw in the flag. The prices are great too as each taco is $6 but well worth it as portions are huge. I sure wish they had a place like this in Fullerton CA  because I would be there daily. They also have other mexican food items on the menu if fry bread is not your thing. Will have to make Angelinas one of my go to places next time I'm in Glendale. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Angelina's is sooo good!  Their fry bread tacos are phenomenal!  They have a great selection of food not just fry bread. It's a cute little restaurant with great hometown feel and they sell old time candy like candy cigarettes, wax lips and many others. You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The service was fast. The employees were nice and helpful. Clean clean and clean. My husband and I are happy we are here today what a treat. We had the fry bread taco with red sauce and I had the chimichanga with green sauce rice and beans. We ended up getting a fry bread with honey and powder sugar to go. This is the place to go! Yumm!!"}
{"text":"I'm so , how did I not know this place existed?! 
Found this little gem through yelp, and I am so glad! 
What a cute place I want to sit here all day. I'm eating delicious Indian fried bread with red chile, and a side of rice. Their rice is so flavorful. They serve you warm chips with 2 salsas, one is green and also delicious cucumber red salsa.  
I swear I feel like I'm eating at my nanas.  The food is so good! Service is good. Wow I have nothing bad to say. You can even sit outside! Just wow."}
{"text":"Awesome staff great service clean and the food was amazing! Fry Bread is huge and can be shared!! I love it we will definitely be back with the whole family!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was luck or the norm, but if you're hungry and want it fast, then this is the place to eat.  Hot, fresh and tasty sums it up pretty well.  Even my kid ate all his food, and that rarely happens.  The place is clean and modern looking, with a throw back to the past with their candy section.  The only thing that wasn't to my preference was the salsa, the heat was there but a little too tangy for me.   Had the red chili open face Navajo taco, and it was the bomb diggity!  Finished off the meal with their sopapilla, covered it with powdered sugar and honey, and it hit the spot.  We will be back for sure, might be the place to go on a Sunday after church.  It wasn't too busy on a Friday evening, which was good for us, but not for them.  They do have other things on the menu, so if you're not a fan of fry bread fan, try something else.  Give it a try, I think you'll enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wife thought it would be fun to stop in here for dessert last night and they didn't disappoint. We only got a plain fry bread and drizzled honey on it. It was fantastic. Service was good and the place was very clean. We sat on the patio. My only complaint was the smell outside, it wasn't to pleasant. The odor appeared to be coming from storm drain. Not their fault."}
{"text":"Service was awesome, really friendly/fun/attentive staff. Nice, clean little place with good food. I really enjoyed the salsas. A steady amount of take out customers circulated through within the 45 mins we were there, so it seems to be a well liked place. I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places!!! The Fry Bread is excellent, as is everything we have had there, including the best menudo I have had since my dad's."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for Fry Bread and I am an Arizona native!  First time here, very clean, very nice customer service, and the fastest fry bread I've ever gotten.  Had the open face fry bread and posole, both very good.  Will defintely be back!"}
{"text":"Good fry bread and Mexican food. Though not up to par with the Fry Bread House it's very tasty and certainly worth a stop while on the area."}
{"text":"Mm mm fry bread. This place is good. 

Have it any way you like it - meat, beans, cheese, sour cream..

The salsa is the only down fall - it's not hot just a lot of vinegar. 

My favorite part is that they have pickles..the best pickles!"}
{"text":"UGHHH SO GOOD!!! I wanted to eat here every single day while I was visiting family in Arizona. The fry bread is soooo good. I also tried the carne asada burrito, shredded beef taco, and the horchata -- all were top notch! The staff is super friendly and the inside is clean and welcoming. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"VERY good Indian Taco's here. I've eaten them my whole life, authentic ones on the reservations and all around Arizona and New Mexico so I have an extremely picky pallet for them. This place does quite well, very friendly, quick service and a great atmosphere. I wish there prices were a TAD bit cheaper but they aren't horrible. All in all great food, great service, great atmosphere. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD , GREAT SERVICE, GREAT ATMOSPHERE......love love love it!!!! If you're looking for some kickass frybread....THIS IS IT GUYS...LOOK NO FURTHER ....I savored every bite, and almost finished the salsa (red salsa) ...it was amazingly delish!!!! It's too bad it's a little out of my way so i had to drive a little further but it was so worth the drive, and very filling."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and am anxious to go back. I got the carne asada fry bread taco. First of all, it is a huge taco. Gotta love that. Tasted great too. Combining fry bread with carne asada is a win-win for me."}
{"text":"This place gas some really grwat food. Love the red chili burritos. Its great how they have the different old candies."}
{"text":"Wife wanted a cheese fry bread, it's been a really long time since we tried it.
We have always had good experiences here, always clean"}
{"text":"Wow! No really wow! I'm a green Chile aficionado and this has the best I've had in the valley. The fry bread was soft, fluffy snd fresh. My dining companions ate off the regular menu and cleaned their plates. The red enchilada sauce is bragworthy. Hearty portions and superb customer service. Worth the drive from Chandler."}
{"text":"We love to eat here! This is the only place I would consider a must go to for Indian Fry Bread! Excellent service and selection of Mexican food too! Oh and lots of candy available that I have not seen in years!! They have a little candy shop inside there too!!"}
{"text":"Fry bread was very good, soup was a huge serving size, tamales were a bit dry but not bad at all, and the horchata was some of the best I have had. We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Really good fry bread.  The roast beef topped tostada of light fry bread was really good."}
{"text":"This place was alright. I had the menudo and wasn't want i expect it. Don't like that it is counter service. If you're a restaurant then you should have a waitress or waiter."}
{"text":"Because of reviews went to try this place today! Kind of confused, no one was friendly, I might say they were polite, but not friendly! Food did come quickly! We both ordered same thing, fry bread tacos, with carnitas! One was cooked very light, one darker! Was wondering where the carnitas were, but found all on one end! Can't say I didn't like it but lacked any kind of flavor! Maybe should have tried the red or green chile one! But the kicker was NO refills on drinks, it was 113 degrees today and the food was so dry! Can't say I will return, quite a ways to drive! If I'm in the area, I may try something else so I could be a better judge of food! 

Went back today for another try, went away disappointed, the place was empty and stayed empty the whole lunch time. The food is just plain bland, needed flavor, and just dry. Won't go back again, they were not very friendly this time either more like bored!"}
{"text":"They obviously don't know what a \"Cheese Crisp\" is 
Keyword \"Crisp\"
I saw them take a floor tortilla with some cheese in it and put it in the \"microwave\"
This isn't even how you make a quesadilla.

They boxed it up and handed it to me and I told him it was a quesadilla not a cheese crisp. 
The guy behind the counter told me they were the same thing only folded. 
So I paid over $6 for a Cheese Crisp and got a $3 quesadilla.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been here several times and have found the food to be consistently delicious. I am from New Mexico, so I have really high standards for Mexican food and this place meets (maybe exceeds) my expectations. The fry bread is fresh and delicious. The red chili has good flavor and a little bit of a kick to it. The chicken tacos are excellent (freshly made shells). The chips and salsa are unique (but good). The location is a bit hard to find (it is in a shopping complex with a grocery store) and the service is mediocre, but gets the job done. I will continue to come here for excellent Mexican food when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"What an amazing little mexican restaurant spot serving the local city of glendale! 
Apparently the owner used to sell his fry bread at a different place.
Fry bread!!! Puff deliciousness!! Why would anyone want a regular tortilla after trying this?
We stopped in for lunch during the week and were ao surprised. 
Friendly staff who really do everything they can to make yoir dining experience special.
Walk up counter but they bring everything to you and clean up after you.
Lunch specials are great. Priced super reasonably.
Lots to pick from.
Tacos on fry bread. Brilliant.
They even have fry bread dessert.
They are open for dinner also.
The owner is fabulous. Preps and cooks himself as these are his family recipes.
He came out to talk with us and seems to know all the locals."}
{"text":"I called in to pick up a side of Spanish Rice and refried beans.. I was really craving it.. My rice was really dry, bland and dull in color. I am familiar with Spanish (or even Mexican) rice. And this was by far of it.  For the beans, there were multiple chunks of dry beans in the \"refried beans\" . the chunks tasted burnt.. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Didn't know there was a fry bread restaurant in the West Valley. Did 2 of the lunch specials under $20 (fry bread topped with beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and your choice of meat along with a drink, rice, and homemade chips and salsa). Delicious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Extremely friendly staff.  Quaint cafe style layout with small outdoor patio.  Had frybread taco with pork, frybread supreme with ground beef and a horchata all of which were very good.  

First time here.  We will be back!  

PS: all decked out with Christmas decorations - very festive!"}
{"text":"The place was clean and well decorated. The food came out fast, which means it was prepared in advance and it kinda tasted like it. The menu is crazy over priced for the food you get. I do not mind paying money for good food but this was bland and did not taste authentic. The fry bread was greasy and tasteless! The tables are too close together and we kept running into other customers and chairs. I bought a taco, tamale, tostada, rice and beans and one fry bread taco, add two medium drinks and we spent $28. Tasted like a $4 meal! You are better off at one of the \"bertos\"!!"}
{"text":"So Yummy! Closet I have found to my favorite Taco place back in Iowa. Fodder is delicious and people are very welcoming. Prices are good and large serving size."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at this restaurant. Food is always great and the staff is friendly. Can't beat their lunch special as well."}
{"text":"To the point and delicious it was our families first time here and everybody loves it this chips and salsa are great and everything is fresh 100%"}
{"text":"I am so impressed with the quality of this food. I don't understand why there aren't hundreds of reviews. Angelina's hands down supersedes the fry bread house that is in downtown Phoenix. Like a hundred times better. The horchata is homemade here and it is delicious. They also make there own guacamole. All the staff was friendly and the owner was also there that day and he was very nice. I will definitely be eating here a lot!!! They also have Mexican food and they bring free chips and salsa to your table. The chips are very authentic and the green salsa was my favorite."}
{"text":"Well this review is going to be done 2 ways lol. First with the 5 stair review. The service and fry bread very good, there hot sauce as well. It's very clean inside. Now we have to go the the 1 or 2 stairs. There Mexican food is very bad not a lot of flavor just not good at all. This was the 1st time having there Mexican food and will be the last. Will be back for there fry bread."}
{"text":"Only in the area to meet someone. Since they were running about an hour behind. I decided to have lunch here.
Ordered the green chili pork on fry bread with pink lemonade. 
First,
Very filling, was able to eat only have if the meal. They give you plenty of lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes. Beans and pork were not as much, still enough to enjoy. Though the fry bread might not have been cooked enough, but it might be that their bread is light, which was different but enjoyable. 
I really enjoyed my lemonade! might be more that this was the first time I had something else then water for the first time in two months? 
Overall I thought this place was great, would diffidently make a trip for another experience."}
{"text":"It was good food, very nice employees. I just feel it's overpriced for what it is. Fry bread, beans and veggies 25 bucks for lunch for two."}
{"text":"Wow what a nice surprise Angelina's was to come across! I felt like I was eating pozole at my Nana's house. Great customer service and quick fresh quality food. There were even little tea light candles on the table for a comfy environment to just devour great food. We will definitely be back for another open faced supreme. We had it with carne asada and it was so tender and flavorful!"}
{"text":"This is a really great little place to eat! The food is good and the portions are huge. You will not go hungry here. It is counter service here but the staff are super accommodating and very friendly. I had the Green Chili Pork Taco Salad and it was delicious! I can eat but I could not finish the whole thing.

The place also serves as a candy store that features all of your old favorites: Bottle Caps, Waxed Lips, Pop Rocks, Candy Necklaces, Fun Dip, Necco Waffers and many more. The menu is small but well conceived. It is located in a strip-mall on 51st Ave and Olive. Don't be scared \"East Siders\" they don't bite on the west side (or keep knives and guns strapped to there hip\". If you are heading out to Ak-Chin Pavillion for a concert, take a diversion and put on the feed bag here. I think that you will enjoy it quite a bit!

{"text":"This place is awesome. Pictures don't do justice. Portions for one could feed two or three people. Don't understand why the place is not packed!"}
{"text":"Taco Salad and the Chimichanga was huge portions. Fresh ingredients and not out of a can. Excellent food, service, place is very clean. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday and I felt like I was interrupting the staff. The food was good but as well as the service not so much when I think of fry bread again next time I will go somewhere that I feel wants me to spend my money at."}
{"text":"Some of the best fry bread in phoenix. Huge portions and great prices! When you come here be sure to bring an appetite! Can't wait to go back and try more of their other dishes"}

{"text":"How can anyone find fault with fry bread?  It's just so good. This place is clean, service is friendly and the prices are fair.  The menu has some Mexican food items if you're looking for more than fry bread."}
{"text":"I now have been back many times and my love for this Joint is steadfast... I've now ventured beyond the Fry Bread and still my 5 star rating remains... 
Please patronize Angelina's, don't let the Ma & Pa Joints we love falter...we NEED to support our favorite independent local establishments..."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall, and my first experience with frybread. I had it with beans, cheese, tomatoes, and shredded chicken. In retrospect, I may have overestimated my appetite, but it was yummy. My only real complaint was that the shredded chicken was on the dry and bland side. I was hoping for chicken that had been cooked with some sort of flavoring or salsa. It tasted great once I added some salt and a little of the salsa that was on the table though. The horchata was delicious too, and the selection of old-fashioned candy was fun to browse even though I didn't end up buying anything. Overall, I'd come back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They have a good lunch special which includes a smaller version  of the frybread, with a drink and side of Spanish rice. Their homemade salsa is also very tasty. Price and flavor is good, and they also have a tempting assortment of old time and Mexican candies as well. 

The only complaint, if you can call it that, was the guy who took our order was rather strange, and kept laughing at whatever he said."}
{"text":"I had hi hopes for this restaurant. With all the great pics and good reviews, but it was a big let down. First and foremost the only reason I gave them 2 stars  is for the restaurant's appearance. It is very clean and well dressed. They also have a very clean restroom.
Now on to the food   Like I say on the pic I posted, their shredded beef is from Smart & Final out of a can. So disappointing BC when I go to a small restaurant (mom and pop shop) I've come to expect house recipes not out of the can. So I didn't enjoy my fry bread at all. 
On to the service. We ordered 2 of the same fry breads and a cheese crisp. Then someone ordered after us. Well they bring our fry bread out and say nothing about our cheese crisp. So I go up to get onion and to ask about our cheese crisp as I'm asking about our cheese crisp they service the people that ordered after us their meal and proceeded to tell me they're still working on our cheese crisps. What the heck, that's supposed to be an appetizer not a desert. So needless to say I won't be returning. I'll just wait for the State Fair come around again to have the real stuff."}
{"text":"Angelinas fry bread is the best in the state of Arizona. The restaurant is clean, staff friendly and great food. What more to ask for??"}
{"text":"Food was bland. Ordered Carne asada taco and meat was so bland I thought it was chicken
 They argued with me and said it was Carne asada so I reluctantly ate 3 more bites and packed it up to go. Husband ordered red chilli burrito. It was just mush and mediocre flavor. Staff was awkward, not real friendly. Seemed bored to be there. Won't go back =-/"}
{"text":"Cozy place. We ordered open face supreme frybread. Huge serving size! I really think one frybread serves two. I regret that I should have shared it with my kid. If you eat in, you get free chips and salsa. The chips are amazing. I believe it's homemade and omg... I never ever wanna buy those packed chips from grocery stores. Good quality food. Everything was fresh. Frybread is very filling! One thing we do not like is we have to pay for refill... Frybread makes me very thirsty and I had to drink a lot... But 5 stars because food was good and staffs are very friendly."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I wish I lived in AZ just so I could eat here more often. My Aunt (who lives in AZ) and I recently visited this establishment and they get a A+++++++! The food was amazing, the atmosphere was so adorable, the place was clean and comfy and don't get me started on all the old school candy they sell! Had myself a Navajo taco aka fry bread taco. I went for the carnitas and my aunt had the green chili carnitas. My ittie bittie 5'0\" Aunt finished the WHOLE THING! The complimentary chips were super crispy and yummy! I will be back on my next visit to AZ no way I would miss it!"}
{"text":"Best food ever! The portions are large so make sure you are hungry. The fry bread is delicious. There is inside and outside dining. Also, the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Such a cool and fun place, the food is great too!  Both my husband and I ordered our own fry breads but we could have shared one.  The shop has all sorts of types of candy that were popular in the 80's and 90's.  A great find!"}
{"text":"Ordered green chili burrito, enchilada style. What can I say, I should have stuck with the main item in this place, fried bread, but I had a craving for green chili meat, nice and stewed. Too bad I didn't satisfy the craving here. The green chili was way too mushy (maybe too much flour in the sauce?) and it had only small pieces of meat, I had to fork around trying to find them.  My wife ordered the chicken enchiladas, she liked the red sauce, solid flavor, chicken was shredded and tasty. My aunt ordered the combo plate of green chili: she liked the refried beans and rice, huge flour tortilla, but she had the same opinion of the green chili,   mushy and not enough meat. My aunt did say she had previously tried the fried bread and thought those were great. The place itself was super clean, nicely decorated for the holidays, service was fast and friendly. Based on the cleanliness and excellent service, I'll definitely try it again for the fried bread."}
{"text":"It's definitely tasty, no arguing about that.  You will not feel good after eating fry bread though.  It just soaks up the oil and you eat it anyway because you might as well add another bad choice in your life.  Calorie counters beware."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Well worth the drive (we came from the East Valley). Clean inside and friendly staff. Big portions and super delish!  We will be back."}
{"text":"These other reviews are spot on. 

Atmosphere: Very casual and clean. 3 or 4 TV's hanging on the wall that they will change to whatever channel you are looking to watch. There is outdoor seating which is nice with this amazing AZ weather coming up. It's in a strip mall type of place so the view isn't great but they have it available at least. The capacity is 50 max so it's a small place. It has never been crowded when I've been in but I hear rush hour lunch can get a little crazy. A true bonus is their candy counter. I'm talking old school candy. Wax Lips, Wax Fangs candy necklaces, Razzles, candy cigarettes, Cherry Cocktails, Big Hunks, and loads of Mexican candies. My daughter loves this place just for the candy counter. (she loves the food too but she is a sweets phine)

Food: Their fry bread is hands down the best fry bread in AZ. Some of their toppings are green chile, red chile, beans, shredded chicken, shredded beef, cinnamon, honey, powdered sugar, etc. Absolutely delicious. If you are aren't human and fry bread isn't your thing, they also have burritos, chimis, tacos, tostadas, tamales, and menudo on the weekends. The dishes I've had have not been greasy, overcooked, or bland; which is what you find at most Mexican restaurants that attempt this type of restaurant. Their menu is simple but ample. They have horchata too! NOT the Ole' Jose crap stuff but real homemade sweet creamy horchata. Seriously, it's a little gritty which translates to amazing horchata. I have always been disappointed in Carolina's because they don't have homemade horchata but I'M SO GLAD I FOUND A PLACE THAT DOES.

Service: AWESOME. There are always two guys there; one I'm assuming is the owner if not both of them. They are incredibly friendly and by the time you are done paying with a debit card, your food is waiting in the pickup area. Oh! That reminds me...the \"pickup area\" is stocked with everything you need. Cinnamon, honey, Nutella, Sriacha, salsa, powdered sugar, and other common condiments and supplies. They will come clear your plate from your table if you are dining in and ask if you need a refill or two. They are total sweethearts. 

Support your local economy and small businesses. This place is definitely worth keeping around. Go Angelina's!"}
{"text":"Great clean place great food very generous portions,great service.  Only reason I left of 1 star was is a bit pricey.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We were on our way to a hockey game tonight, and wanted to grab a bite to eat. Using the nearby feature I found this gem. I had a ground beef street taco, and C had the carne asada. Excellent! Fry bread was flaky and crispy, meat was flavorful, and the beans were delicious. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"This is the best Frybread place I have had in a long time.  It's a bit heavy on the stomach but it is \"Fry\" bread.   I would say that though the food is good it's not the most accommodating place for kids.  The tables and their arrangement make it difficult to bring the family with you.

It's worth trying though!"}
{"text":"While I live on the east side, I have a co-worker that lives on the west side and we decided to meet here for lunch today.

I had the fry bread taco with red chili beef.  Simple, and excellent.  While they have a full service menu that all looks worth trying, my co-worker and I both stuck with the fry bread taco.

The food was presented well, arranged with care, and very prompt service.  These people have a very clean establishment, and know how to do food service by paying close attention to their customers.  Good service doesn't mean coming up to the table and interrupting the conversation to ask if everything is ok - good service is paying attention to the diners and recognizing when attention is needed.  This place does that better than any restaurant I've been in over the past few years.

If you're in the neighborhood (nw corner of 51st Ave and Olive), give them a shot, you will not be disappointed.  Proprietors that get it right are few and far between."}
{"text":"The kids say that the only thin bad about this place is that they don't serve pepsi... hahaha! We had 2 fry bread lunch specials and a plain fry bread.  The plain one has the option of adding toppings which include honey, powdered sugar, cinnamon,  cinnamon sugar, pb and j and such. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Horrible imitation fry bread food taste bland the actual bread taste old and reheated the tea I ordered was already made in pre filled cup that had a flavor of onions would not recommend and will never return to this restaurant horrible food horrible service"}
{"text":"My first time here & it couldn't have been a better experience. I haven't had fried bread in so many years! I ordered the fried bread supreme with carne asada & I was not expecting such a great plate. It was the size of my face but evenly filled with meat, beans, & the toppings. Such great & fast service & tasteful food"}
{"text":"I have only tried the fry bread (Navajo taco style) but it is delicious and has made me come back for more.  I usually do the lunch special which is plenty for me.  They have three different types of salsa that are all really good as well.  The store is clean and quaint and its interesting to be able to get some of the old type candy that is in front of the register.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Far from authentic Mexican, but what brings me here time and time again is their frybread. 
Usually you'd only be able to enjoy it at the state fair, as far as I know, but here they make an excellent frybread. 
If you're not in the mood for sweets, try their open face taco. It's a frybread with beans, cheese, tomato, and lettuce."}
{"text":"I love eating even more than I do sleeping (and MAN do I love sleeping), so of course the first thing I do when I'm traveling somewhere is see what restaurants are near my destination. I grew up in Glendale but haven't lived there in 16 years, so when I come back to visit my parents I try to eat as much Mexican food as I can before sulking back to Seattle where you just can't find anything quite as good. Recently I decided to try Angelina's Fry Bread, which I'd noticed on Yelp during previous visits.

The dining area was clean and well lit, and the staff were friendly. I was interested in fry bread but there were a lot of other options on the menu. I ordered a bean and cheese fry bread taco, and my fella ordered the ground beef version. The good: the fry bread \"taco\" (fry bread folded over and filled) was the size of my dingdang head. The beans were good, as was the green salsa I put on it. Pricing was pretty good for the amount of food we got. The bad: the fry bread itself tasted a little...off. I'm not sure if the frying oil needed to be changed or something, but it tasted kind of wonky. My fella's ground beef filling was not very good at all - overly salty, and it appeared to be the consistency of Taco Bell (aka: just-add-water) beef. At least the toppings were fresh. 

I ordered a green corn tamale to go, and that ended up being super yummers.

Overall the food was a bit of a disappointment considering the plentiful rave reviews, but perhaps the non-fry bread food items are better."}
{"text":"Super quick response from the restaurant-I stand corrected...Yelp has been slow to update their hours for them. Will post a review once we have tried Angelina's. Looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Very good and we will be returning big serving sizes are huge. Would recommend the bean and cheese folded. Had a honey and powdered sugar."}
{"text":"This place had wonderful food. We ordered the supreme fry bread and a burrito with green chili. The flavors wete perfect. We could have shared one or the other as they were huge, but nope they made great leftovers. We also had the fry bread with honey and powderd sugar. If you want fry bread, this is your place."}
{"text":"Best Fry Bread I've had in a long time! Plus the restaurant was clean and the food was delivered quick and all the staff was very friendly. I will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Nice clean place in a strip mall with quick and friendly service. I came for some fry bread and ordered the setvers favorite with beans and beef red chili. It was served in lightning speed and looked perfect with a nice topping of lettuce and cheese. Wow, was all I.could think after my first bite as it was a soggy mess and very hard to find any beef. The beans were like soup and the red chili was tasty but also like soup which in turn turned the fry bread to a sticky mush, not an appetising meal. With all the good ratings along with the flavor of the chili I will be back to try again. I hope it was just a bad day and will be great next time."}
{"text":"Huge portions! Next time we will share. Busy little place. Very clean. Tastes were ok. The fry bread needs to be thicker,  got mushy fast. Over all enjoyed our time here. Nice outside seating. Needs more umbrellas for shade."}
{"text":"My pregnancy cravings have finally kicked in and brought me here! It is so clean inside and the staff is very friendly! The chairs are really big and comfortable. Most of all the food was AMAZING! We got a fry bread with beans, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. A carne asada burrito with beans and rice. A bean and cheese burrito. And a plain fry bread. What I really like is the different salsas they give you with chips! They also have a little station where you can add whichever toppings to your plain fry bread if you would like. The portion sizes were HUGE! So you will not leave here hungry! It was also so so so delicious! I'm probably going to go back again within a few days because it was so delicious!"}
{"text":"My 30 year wait for a non-dessert Sopapilla is over! Light and fluffy to perfection fry bread buried by fresh refried beans, chicken, lettuce and cheese....Freaking Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"First off not pork it's chicken. I ordered a pork green chili fry bread taco. It came as chicken which they insisted was pork. I have worked in the industry long enough to know when I see chicken skin in it that it is not pork lol. The fry bread is very thin with no real substance to it. The chips and salsa are decent. Place is clean. Then order was wrong and had no green chili. Was nice enough to replace with shredded beef tacos. I am going to try those and finish the review in a sec. tacos are big with plenty of meat. They are just dry. If you add the salsa it is pretty good. The beef green chili fry bread is pretty good. You can get only one soda refill. Plain fry bread is pretty good just a little on the thin side."}
{"text":"Hands down best frybread I ever had! It was cooked to perfection but they also have a ton of other options to choose from like menudo on weekends, posole, chimichangas, burritos, and it's also a candy store at the register. The customer service here is what most impressed me though. It seems to be a family run place and the kids were SO respectful and hardworking (you never find that anywhere anymore) and the guy who took my order was kind as well. The setting was Adorable with real flowers as center pieces on every table. Great place, it just became my  favorite place in Arizona. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have never come across a shop like this.  Nestled in the strip mall, next to Ollie's at 51st and Olive.  You walk in to an old time candy shop, order your flatbread tacos at the window and grab a table.  All the tables have comfortable chairs and dining room is clean with TVs. 

The flatbreads are huge. I didn't have one, just watched my guys try to eat one each and they failed. The food here to too heavy for me but they really like the novelty of it and were happily filled for a day a quad riding in the desert.  We had to visit again before we left the valley - they liked them enough then. 

I will have to try a sweet flatbread option sometime. They were calling to me from the menu.  If you go, let me know what you think."}
{"text":"I looked up where to find fry bread and this place popped up. Very great place inside and out. My boyfriend and I ordered the flat fry bread with bean and cheese lettuce and sauce. The bread was tasteful but From the two big fry breads we ordered that were 8$ and some change we ONLY got 1 cup of sauce. My fault, I should have checked. I also asked for a hot pickle and bit into it in the car and it was dill ;( . Not too happy. Maybe he wasn't listening to me but he was VERY NICE ;) they also have such a big variety on their menu to choose from. Next time I might try there carne asada or ground beef flat fry bread ;) and definitely dine in for seconds lol"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and had to come check it out..pretty damn good and their red and green sauce have good flavor. The reviews were more than right. Eat your heart out Filaburtos. And they honor vets on Wed too. Major plus"}
{"text":"The service was not rude but it defiantly was not friendly. Person behind the counter didn't make any eye contact and when asked what was good just said the 'fry bread'. I ordered that to go and the meal was filling but lacked any good flavor. The chicken was bland and dry. It wasn't very expensive so that's why I didn't give it 2 stars"}
{"text":"Great food, huge proportions, amazing price, friendly service, what else is there to say!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place has been here for 9 months already! Walked in, saw an Open Faced Supreme and said, \"Wow, look at the size!\" A woman at a table said, \"...and its really good.\" She wasn't lying. I ordered it and loved it! Even tried the Horchata drink based on another reviewer's bragging. Loved it! Amazing! 
Will definitely be returning regularly."}
{"text":"Heard this place was great and went in tonight to try it out. First thing that turned me off was the charge for refills. I get that small businesses need to make money, but free refills are pretty standard fare and personally, I'd rather you charge me a bit more up front than to have to pay every time I want a refill. Also, their horchata was chalky like it was made from a powder/mix. I didn't realize how huge the fry bread tacos were and made the mistake of ordering two of them. There was no chance I could even finish one, so ordering two was completely stupid. I did taste them both (one chicken, one beef) and the chicken was definitely the better one but their fry bread was extremely oily tasting and kind of salty. It was a bit of a turn off. Same with the homemade chips. Way too much salt. The taco filling was pretty decent but overall there was nothing that would make me want to come back. Service was polite and they have a pretty good selection on their menu."}
{"text":"It has been years since I have had a fry bread taco that I have enjoyed. I thought this would be different for todays for lunch let's give it shot ..WOW am I amazed best one I've ever had. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp because my family needed a quick snack in AZ. I LOVE THIS PLACE. Omg, from the open supreme fry bread to the plain fry bread ( for dessert ) this place is amazing!! I need to find a place like this in Cali! But I doubt it!!!"}
{"text":"NOT AUTHENTIC...Growing up eating the best mexican food from home it was a  disappointment to pay 60.00 for a family of 4. Food was  okay the price just was not right. Not a dine in friendly place. Refills are not free. I live really close too this place but i will not be a regular. Go to Canasta, Carolina, garcia on McDowell  and 35th ave. Pay the same with full restaurant  service. The menudo meat is good but they use  can hominy corn i know because ive used it personally  and know the difference. DONT WASTE YOUR CASH.."}
{"text":"We had to have some frybread before we left town and we had a nice experience at Angelina's. Although the menu is fairly large with tacos, burritos, tostadas, etc., frybread is something we don't get a lot of where we're from and that was what we came for. We both enjoyed our meals but you have to make sure that the bread isn't hidden like how I ordered.

I had the open faced supreme with beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato with red sauce beef. The bread was fried perfectly with a crunchy but light exterior, yet more dense than a sopapilla. But there was an absurd amount of lettuce and cheese hiding the frybread. I think the way to go is a taco like my wife or maybe open faced with just beans and cheese. Or maybe just the plain frybread with honey, sugar, or cinnamon.

I also had a cup of the menudo. It's been a while since I've had it, but Angelina's is just as funky as I remember all menudos and tripe fans will be happy too as half of the cup was filled with the stomach tissue. I think I'll save having this soup for only when I'm hung over.

There was plenty of seating in the restaurant. Service was friendly and helpful, which continued after we received our food. $25 got us a satisfying lunch and we were pleased we didn't miss out on the frybread."}
{"text":"I had the plain fry bread with honey and sugar.  A little greasy for my taste bit it was hot and fresh.  I think I like the fry bread house better. The employees here are not very friendly."}
{"text":"I  am  40 year  Glendale  resident    This  place  is  clean, fast, reasonable  and  has  generous portions of  delicious  food      All  the  standard dishes, plus  menudo on the weekends
Plenty  of  parking in the Fry's parking lot     No paper plates, real ceramic one  with steel cutlery. A small thing, but it makes a  difference to me.   Go and  eat !!"}
{"text":"Carne asada fry bread taco is the real deal and the owner and staff are best in town. It's a must try if your around town"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since back in the day.  When was that you ask?   Well they used to be inside the indoor swap meet @  27th Ave and camelback.  Yeah I used to pay a dollar entry fee just to have the ability to order from this place!   Since they have moved there has been no change in quality of the fry bread!   It is just as good as always. Also be aware that the salsa is highly addictive!   I'm not sure what they put in it but holy goodness batman it is amaze balls"}
{"text":"The reason I read it to three-star was one the service is fast and quick friendly restaurant looks very clean; however, the food is mediocre. The menudo  is kind of plain you need to add more salt to it and lots of lemon.  The Indian fry bread if you had the meat it's terrible I ended up throwing it away and I just bought a plain bean and cheese and lettuce one. My son ended up not eating the menudo and just to be polite he just asked if I could order him Indian fry bread plain so he could add honey. And to be fair we did give it a few more tries however, food still needs some critiquing i.e. Adding flavor to the food."}
{"text":"Great Burrito Good price.  Food was very good. Service was a little slow. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great Frybread. Try the powdered sugar and honey. There's something about their honey that brings out the flavor in the frybread."}
{"text":"Open face was great. Had green chilli beef and it was so damn good. Hot sauce has a great flavor. Clean place. Staff is super friendly. Got the desert fry bread and it's bomb. Def be back. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is located in the Fry's parking lot on 51st and Olive. Don't let that fool you. We came in and it is clean and the staff welcoming. It was our first time so we took a minute to look at the menu. We ordered the open face carne asada supreme and 2 of the frybread tacos one with shredded beef and one with carne asada.  By the time we paid the food was on the counter for pickup and the dinning began. The food was excellent. The frybread did not get soggy and stayed crisp throughout. The salsa came in a squirt bottle which was perfect for squirting onto there crispy chips. The food was so much my daughter couldn't finish but that's ok since my husband was enjoying the food enough to finish hers off. I must say I was impressed and happy that yelp had not steered us wrong. We will be back."}
{"text":"Fry bread was great! First place I have gotten my food before I was finishing paying for it! Quaint authentic Family owned Mexican restaurant. We had the enchiladas and they were yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and clean.  

The staff is friendly and the kitchen is a quasi open concept  which makes it easy to see how clean it is,  and the cleanliness of the employees.  

The salsa,  on point.  The rice and beans delicious and they are priced at lunch to complete with anyberto's. (Note the staff at bertos are usually unfriendly and from a cleanliness standpoint, they remind me more of a murder scene than a resteraunt.)  

Got the lunch special, large portions with a drink under 8 bucks. 

I will definitely be back."}
