{"text":"The Yelpers have spoken and they are right: this is a must must must try. Absolutely delicious puffs of goodness in a heavenly sauce that just melts in your mouth, making you savour every single bite and wish for more.   I was also surprised at how full I was after eating just the half portion! My appetite isn't small at all and I've come to expect quality over quantity at these higher end spots downtown. Well worth the price in my opinion, especially given the exceptional execution of the dish itself.  Hoping they expand their menu in the future! I know I'll be back to try anything new this chef has to offer :)"}
{"text":"Got the cream-based, truffled mushroom gnocchi a few times, because that creamy mushroomy goodness always serves as lovely, warming comfort food in the winter.  I find the half portion is enough for a substantial lunch or dinner, although I have also managed to polish off a whole portion on my own too...what can I say, those truffle shavings just grab a hold of me!"}
{"text":"The cheeseburger and fries have been calling my name for awhile. I finally ordered it. So freaking good! The patty was a little thin though so I wish I had ordered the double patty. Either way, flavors were great and the toppings--pickles, onion, and I think some kind of special sauce--made it. The fries were good too and the portion was generous. I will say they were just a tad too salty. Not enough to keep me from finishing them though!"}
{"text":"This was probably my favorite place in Assembly Hall.  The staff is really nice and the food was amazing.  My group ended up getting the truffle fries and gnocchi.  It was richness overload but we still ended up devouring it all.  Gnocchi: 8.5/10 Truffle fries: 9/10"}
{"text":"Freaking delicious.   I swear, I'm about to gain 10 lbs from being so close to the assembly hall... I'm in Toronto for business and I happen to be staying at the Sheraton right across the street from the newly open restaurant hall.   This is very similar to Los Angeles' grand central market. Tons of food \"stations\" and hip seating area. Actually it's nicer than gran central market. It's nice and new and in the summer there will be this amazing patio.   Resto Boemo has a really awesome friendly staff. It's still new, but I'm loving their simple menu so far. The truffle gnocchi is to die for. Perfect texture and meld of flavors. You can taste the citrus and the truffle richness in each bite. I opt for the half order and it was more than enough for my big appetite. The kale salad is pretty tasty too however. I may ask for the dressing to be in the side next time. It was definitely overdressed for my liking. The almonds and dried blueberries were great at balancing the entire dish.   The guy told me I would want to come back every other day. He wasn't wrong, I totally would if eating this all the damn time wouldn't make me blow up! Haha.   Edit: made a second trip. Wed 2/7 lunch rush. Service sucked. They need to communicate better when it's busy. My pasta was left sitting cold while they were trying to get the rest of my order (side salad). Meanwhile they were serving up people who ordered after me hot pasta...still they're lucky their food taste so god damn good, but please work on this."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the line up and lives up to the hype.   The burger patty is grilled perfectly and the cheese just melts and oozes all over it.  Definitely get the seasoned fries with it to have the ultimate combo."}
{"text":"I had the truffle mushroom cream gnocchi, it was too good to describe. I ate the dish in silence until the whole (large portion) is devoured and the bottom of the plate, scraped clean!"}
{"text":"Located in the Assembly Chef's Hall, Resto Boemo offers an assortment of items ranging from burgers and fries to gnocchi. I got a half portion (160g) of the Truffle Gnocchi for around $18 plus tax (the \"full\" portion is 200 grams - $23). Overall, it was delicious - very creamy and definitely comfort food. I would say the sauce is on par with truffle gnocchi dishes I've had at other restaurant, but the texture of the gnocchi here is softer. I just wish mine had more mushrooms! My friend got the Chorizo Gnocchi, which ended up being way too salty.   We both agreed that the half portion was super small and both of us were still pretty hungry afterwards. It was pretty much an expensive snack. I don't think the \"upgrade\" to the \"full\" portion would have made much of a difference as it's only 40 grams more.  -1 full star for not accepting cash. It's a bit strange, to be honest. Even if you see nothing wrong with it because you only use cards yourself, consider places that don't accept cards and how you'd probably get annoyed too."}
{"text":"Really good gnocchi. I wish there were more mushrooms. Pricey? Yes. Portion size is also quite small. It's a sit down price for what is basically a food court setting. Though I probably won't come back, it was still one of the best gnocchi I had tasted! 3.5/5"}
{"text":"A fan of Chef Ivana and I had their pasta today and a side of pig fries.  Very yummy and the half sized pasta was just the right amount for lunch.  Will try something again next time!"}
{"text":"**~THE GOOD~**  I love gnocchi so every time it's on the menu, there's no doubt this is what I will be ordering. In Toronto, it's very rare to find a light and fluffy gnocchi.  So when I saw Resto Boemo is offering ricotta gnocchi on their menu, I knew I had to try them.  Surprisingly it's not the Gnocchi that made a lasting impression on me rather it's one of the ingredients they put on top called Peruvian Sweet Drop. It's a cross between a jalapeno pepper and tomato and tasted sweet and tart at the same time. This unique ingredient makes it one of the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. I just wished they have put more of this on the dish as I counted there were only 6 on my plate.   **~THE BAD~**  Between potato and ricotta gnocchi, I prefer the latter since they're much lighter and just melts in your mouth.  This is not the case with Resto Boemo's ricotta gnocchi. They're very dense, mushy and dull.  The chorizo red sauce is also lacking in taste due mainly to the scant quantity of the chorizo. For $17.95 +tax/tip, I really didn't enjoy this dish and I was extremely disappointed.  Also while waiting for my food, I saw one the cook grab one of the ingredients (with his bare hands) and literally put it on his mouth. I find this very unprofessional and utterly disgusting!"}
{"text":"I had several friends tell me to check out Resto Boemo, they were raving about the burger so I decided to give it a try. I've eaten here twice and both were enjoyable experiences.   The burger is delicious, the quality of meat could be a bit better but I overlooked that as the meat was juicy and there was tons of flavor. I obviously ordered a double patty and with the cheese melted in between, it was extremely greasy and satisfying. The fries were covered in Parmesan - they could have been crispier.   Moving on to the Gnocchi - I have to say I was very surprised by the Gnocchi here. It is really delicious. The Gnocchi is super light and so flavorful, the mushrooms and truffle sauce compliment the Gnocchi. I would highly recommend the Gnocchi.   Keep Eating,  Angela"}
{"text":"After looking at the offerings from all the other outlets, we kept coming back to Resto Boemo. Their display plates appealed to us, looked really good, and smelled good.  Resto Boemo is a collaboration between Chef Ivana Raca and Chopped Canada's host, Brad Smith. I've watched Chef Ivana prepare delicious looking food on TV over the years and this was a great chance to try her food. Chef Ivana was there so we knew we'd be getting the real stuff!  We ordered the Boemo Boho Gnoch, gnocchi with mushroom truffle cream sauce, and the Parm Fries.  The gnocchi was absolutely delicious, pillow-soft texture, rich creamy sauce with mushrooms and truffles. I could have had a bowl of that sauce! It was so good, we tried to get every drop of it with the fries! I'm getting my own large portion of this next time!  The seasoned thin-cut fries were crispy and delicious. Not a morsel was left behind.  I'll have to try some of their other dishes next time. If you can't decide where to go in Assembly Chef's Hall, try Resto Boemo!"}
{"text":"For some reason I had no idea this this place even existed... I guess I've been living under a rock or something.  Anyway, I stumbled across this gastro Hall, as it were, and decided to opt for the burger based on all the positive reviews. I can safely say that it is definitely a legit Burger! Patties are made from scratch and grilled fresh, served on a perfectly Toasted Bun. It's the perfect balance between a moist Patty and a crispy finish.. Burgers come with fries and you can opt for cheesy truffle fries instead. After reading all the reviews I decided to try it. In all honesty the first couple of bites were delicious, but then I found that the rest of the fries were too dry for my liking. A little disappointing, but overall I'd still give it a strong 4/5.   This Assembly Hall is a definitely legit place to check out, I can't wait to come back and try more of the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Working downtown has its perks and one of them is being walking distance to the Assembly Chef's Hall. I've tried some of the other offerings at the hall but was always intrigued to eat here. I had only sampled that truffle gnocchi they were handing out on my first visit which was very good and my coworkers raved about the chorizo gnocchi in red sauce as well.   I opted for their double B burger with parmesan truffle fries since I kept seeing pictures of it online. It did not disappoint. The burger was juicy and full of flavour and the toppings and buttery bun complimented it well. Reminded me almost of a shake shack burger. They give you a decent portion of fries and the parmesan truffle shavings on top give it a nice taste and gourmet flair. Now the double patty burger and fries came to a whopping $18.50, very expensive for a lunch but I guess it comes with the territory considering that they are situated in the downtown core. Will come back for dinner sometime to try a full serving of the gnocchi."}
{"text":"First time checking out this resto spot last Thursday and I was delighted to check out this quaint offering headlined by Owner Brad Smith and Chef Ivana Raca.    I had the pleasure of having Mr. Smith prepare from start to finish my single patty burger order.   The burger was cooked to perfection, tasted fresh, juicy and flavorful.    I loved the extra kick that the secret sauce gave to the burger and the shoestring fries were well prepared, nicely seasoned, and never skimpy.    I am definitely coming back to try more offerings, such as their gnocchi."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in 2 days. Need I say more? I opted to follow the recommendations of other reviewers and tried the Truffle Gnocchi and Parmesan Truffle Fries. Both were delicious!   The gnocchi is light as air and allows the truffle cream sauce to truly shine. Sliced mushrooms add both texture and flavor.   Portion sizes are generous. An order of fries fills up half the tray!"}
{"text":"The most incredible food that you will ever put in your mouth. HANDS DOWN. Resto Boemo oh how I love you..."}
{"text":"I would say this is definitely one of the top three place in Chefs Assembly hall. Their truffle gnocchi, made with cottage cheese so you don't feel heavy afterwards, is absolutely delicious. The truffle sauce is quite strong, but not overpowering. Given the many options you have at this food court, I would definitely recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"BELIEVE THE HYPE! Without peeking at reviews for The Assembly vendors I decided what's for lunch based on my instincts alone. After circling 3-4 times I settled with Resto Boemo's mushroom truffle gnocchi. PEOPLE, PEOPLE... That was the best gnocchi I've ever had outside fine dining. The gnocchi was soft and mesmerizing. The sauce was addictive. The gentleman who served my food had a great, hospitable personality. The dish comes in regular or large size - the large size was the perfect amount to share between 2.   It's located in The Assembly, a modern, open-concept food court with plenty of clean, table space and something for everyone and accessible through the underground PATH. Nothing short of a 5/5 experience."}
{"text":"What we got: - Double patty burger with fries - Truffle gnocchi  What's awesome: Excellent food and fast service. Ingredients are fresh. Burger cooked medium and complements bread perfectly. Really well done mushrooms and truffle sauce on the super soft gnocchi - kept dipping our fries in it!  What's meh: Overpriced as prices are same as sit down restaurant. Except you don't get the service (nor a guaranteed seat).  Tip: - No need to be greedy and get the half portion gnocchi vs full sized. A few bites and you're good to go. Unless you are sharing with another hungry friend. Which in that case, yes go get the full sized!"}
{"text":"As part of a hodgepodge potluck/tour with my friends to sample as many vendors' offerings as possible, I bought the gnocchi. This gnocchi is crack. One bite apiece, and two of my friends were compelled to get their own portions.  Freshly put together in front of my eyes, this beautiful white sauce gnocchi is extremely crave-worthy. Rich and decadent, perfect size and chew/texture on the gnocchi, and addictively fragrant, the mushroom truffle gnocchi was an extremely delectable bowl of comfort.  It's definitely on my list for when I return to Assembly Chef's Hall for round 2, with sights set on the red sauce variant and the burger. My only regret is buying only a half portion. Recommended."}
{"text":"Located in Assembly Chef Hall this was my favorite restaurant. Rich flavors and high quality ingredients. My party and I enjoyed the truffle parm fries, mushroom truffle cream gnocchi and poutine fries. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked with plenty of truffle. Poutine has plenty of cheese curds and the fries were thinly cut fried to perfection.   The staff here was very friendly and quick when making the food. The line was long, but the team got food to us fairly quickly. If you do dine here definitely get any of the pasta dishes and burgers.  I'll definitely come back for more truffle pasta and a burger!"}
{"text":"The only thing I got from Resto Boemo is their Gnoochi.  Gnoochi so good, soft as a fluffy pillow! The mushroom truffle cream here is one of the best I had! Creamy and Rich!  I always opt for the half portion ($17.95) as it can be quite filling. And maybe one day I will get the truffle shaving on top!"}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, I'd like to admit that I don't eat gnocchi often. I've really only had it a handful of times, and I've found the variations I've had to be too starchy and too dense, leaving me to conclude that I was just not a gnocchi fan. I was therefore a bit hesitant to try Resto Boemo's famous truffle gnocchi, despite reading tons of rave reviews on it. Let me just say, this was a life-changing gnocchi experience for me. The gnocchi here is made mostly of ricotta, so the texture is unlike any gnocchi I've had in the past. It is light, soft and fluffy... not starchy or chewy at all. There is really no discernable cheese flavour either, which is fine by me because the sauce was rich and full of flavour (yet not too salty). I got a half portion for lunch and was expecting to be unable to finish it, but it was actually quite the opposite - I easily could have eaten another portion. In fact, the reason I took one star off was because I left feeling slightly peckish still after paying $20 (!!!) after tax for my half portion of pasta. Definitely a pricey meal... but a treat! I still can't get over the satisfying feeling of biting into each piece ughhh."}
{"text":"For my first visit to the Chef's Assembly Hall, I decided to give Resto Boemo a try. I'd heard that the burger was really something special, and really, who can say no to an above-average burger?  I decided to go with the Double B and I upgraded my fries to Parmesan Fries.  It's fine. The griddle-cooked patty contains a nice crust and the various toppings work quite well together. But unfortunately, said patty was cooked far beyond medium rare. (This was closer to well done, ultimately, which meant it was chewier than it needed to be.) It was also way, way oversalted, which, when combined with the two slices of American cheese, meant that the pervading flavor here was just pure salt.  The fries didn't really help matters. They were McDonald's style but somehow much worse. They were dry as heck and lacking in any real potato flavor. The \"Parmesan\" aspect was pretty much a joke, as the chef sprinkled a little over top just before serving the plate to me (which would be fine if I hadn't paid an extra two bucks for the privilege).  The total cost for two Double B combos and one small sparkling water? $42. $42!  I didn't hate my meal, but for that price, I really should have enjoyed it a whole lot more."}
