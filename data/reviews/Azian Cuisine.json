{"text":"Pretty good takeout with a large selection. Not the best and inexpensive in the area though. Nice for a combination of different Asian flavours though."}
{"text":"all together - OK
we had two rolls of Sushi - a bit boring and dry, nothing great - seems like I can do the same at home ...not bad - just simple - some how I expected more, presentation was simple on round black dish 
we also had General Tzao Chicken and it was again plain and maybe less than OK, not spicy, chicken was warm not hot and moist in heavy sauce 

if you are in a need for lunch it's OK for about $7 per dish - just do not expect top dishes and sushi"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit. Previously I had come for takeout and recalled that it was decent enough here. Today I had lunch. I couldn't decide from their vast menu. Opted for the Thai combo. The pumpkin soup was absolutely Delilsh. I can't say the same for the rest though. The bar was set high with the soup. The combo included Basil chicken ( pretty tasty) pad Thai ( non greasy which is good in my books) mango salad - a bit lack luster and bland. And pineapple for dessert. Also had iced green tea with honey - pretty good. Overall pretty good service and nice decor. Would like to try their sushi and see how that fairs."}
{"text":"Ordered take out of 3 items of corn soup, fried rice and sweet n sour chicken. The soup and fried rice were overly salty, and the white rice that came with the chicken tasted a few days old. We order take out often and have noticed a decline of food quality."}
{"text":"Tried their short ribs, sushi rolls, and general tsos. I would eat the short ribs again. Their glaze is a little bit sweeter than what I have had before. General tsos were okay too."}
{"text":"Pros: place is clean and staff is well dressed. Aprons are clean which is something I always notice
Spring roll- never disappoints. Nice and crispy. Hot with a delectable dipping sauce.

Cons: They are moving over to a self serve style Feb 1. That will be a nightmare I'm sure. They will take your order- but you have to pick it up. They are having difficulty finding full-time servers.
Service is very slow. Not friendly but pleasant and present.Took at least 20 mins to place my order and coffee and place was empty. They don't seem to care if you are there or not.
Never got asked for  a refill on coffee  and had to ask for water.
All in all if you are not looking for great service but decent food. You'll be okay coming here. It's not the greatest but it'll do."}
{"text":"The place WAS good! The food, quality and quantity. The service ... Meh .. They had their days. And the decor WAAS nice. Yea, WaS! They have closed down!  Too bad :("}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and it's pretty good! 
Huge menu with a lot of variety.
The food is enjoyable, though not anything special. 
Sushi is good quality, made with good seaweed and proper rice. 
Mango salad is great! 
Yum Tum Lemon Grass Soup was tomato based and kind of gross. Chinese dishes are not so great.
If you're there and your hungry you won't be disappointed.  You'll leave happy and feeling good."}
{"text":"We were dreading being out in \"the suburbs\" for dinner.

A month of burned promises and our obligation to meet the family in their neck of the woods was suddenly being called into effect.

We pull up to the faceless souless strip mall and start planning to have a generic box-restaurant experience.

Thankfully, looks can sometimes be deceiving.

We order the Vegetarian combo.   It's awesome.   Period.

Such an unexpected surprise!    Can't wait until this chain spreads."}
{"text":"I've known about this place since it opened. I've been there a bunch of times since and it has been very consistent with the quality of food and with the service. Great food, great atmosphere, the only thing I'm not a fan of is the distance it takes to get there. Thank g-d my fiancee lives in the area"}
{"text":"Really good place. I like variety of food there and the prices. Don't go there for lunch, by some reason the quality of food is always better at dinner. Our favorite Asian place in the area."}
{"text":"If I wanted to make my wife happy, I bring home Azian! Need I say more?

But in all honesty, the sushi is always fresh, the menu is reasonably priced and the service is friendly and great.

Don't ever hesitate to eat here! And throw an invite my way too please?"}
{"text":"My brother and I had dinner at the new Maple location last night. Service was fabulous (although it was a slow night) and the ambiance was nice. Decor is cool and modern - very comfortable. The menu is varied. There are Japanese, Chinese and Thai options. We had trouble making a decision. We order salmon sashimi which was very good. I also enjoyed the Tom Yum soup with shrimp but it didn't blow me away. My favourite Tom Yum soup is still from Spring Rolls. We ordered the Sushi and Maki (set for 2) with brown rice (a nice option) for 29.99. My favourite was the spicy tuna roll. We were trying to stay away from the fried food of which there is plenty on this menu. I was dying to try and soft shell crab and the mango chicken and various other dishes including tempura (my favourite) but since I am trying to lose weight, I wisely stayed away. Will definitely come back and try some other dishes, especially their combos and chef exclusives. The waiter was lovely and knowledgeable. I would love to see this restaurant succeed so give it a try."}
{"text":"Food was decent, and service was ok.  Given the fact they serve, Thai, Chinese and Sushi though, the menu tends to be pretty big...almost too big."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprise with my lunch experience at Azian Cuisine. 

Usually I don't go to Asian restaurants that really catered to non Asians... Usually the dishes are modified and can be so \"fusion\" that they don't taste authentic. 

Azian Cuisine is one of those that serves everything 
- Chinese BBQ, dim sum, Cantonese stir fried dishes, congee 
- Japanese 
- Thai 
- Vietnamese 

There's always the problem of how can one restaurant going to make everything good? After having lunch at Azian Cuisine, I cannot really answer that question.. but the Pad Thai ($6.99) I ordered was decently good... Not excellent but surprising good since I didn't expect that much in the first place. 

I have to give extra credit that my Pad Thai used white meat, not too salty, not too oily. gave me a sense that I have a healthy lunch! :)

BTW, all the staffs are Cantonese speaking!"}
