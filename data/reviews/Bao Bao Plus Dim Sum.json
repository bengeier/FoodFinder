{"text":"Cute spot with a disappointing dearth of vegetarian options. Tried a radish dumpling and a 4 mushroom dumpling which were both tasty. I didn't see a brown sauce or soy sauce handy so I grabbed a packet of plum sauce and one if hot sauce. The hot sauce was actually hot.

The place is all take out with two small tables on the curb. Bottled teas and other drinks in self-serve fridges.

Special today was duck with rice and veggies. Didn't see any bao and the wall had about 5 menu options. Not exactly sure what is going on here. 

Owners were very nice and interested in what we thought of the food. 

If you eat meat, I'm sure it's perfectly lovely. 4 dim sum pieces for $5 or a get 6 with rice and veggies for $10."}
{"text":"I love the dim sum here!! There is always multiple choices. $10 for 8 large peices dine in special!! You can't go wrong. They even have a Groupon. 

The lady at the counter is very helpful and patient."}
{"text":"Got some dumplings and Singapore noodles for lunch.
The dumplings were rubbery and not entirely warm. The noodles were dry and also not warmed through. Not entirely sure, but I suspect the noodles were leftovers.

Staff was exceedingly nice. 

If their food quality improves, I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Bought 2 baos for $2 each.
The store felt like they are selling leftovers.
Baos were hard and not placed inside wooden steam baskets."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a dim sum place in the neighbourhood since it's getting harder and harder for me to travel out to Chinatown, Markham or Scarborough to get the good stuff.

I decided to grab something for lunch and after surveying what was available on their hot table, I ordered the lunch special - 6 pieces of dim sum, plus a spring roll and fried rice for $10.  I chose 2 each of the har gow, sui mai and chive dumplings.  

I asked about the spring roll and was told that they weren't ready yet.  I was offered a substitution of my choice but when I requested an egg tart, I was gruffly denied!  I disappointedly selected another chive dumpling.  

The dim sum itself was quite tasty.  Generous sized pieces that were fresh and not overly salty.  Fried rice was simple but fine.  

I found it a bit overpriced...I mean for $10 at a Chinese restaurant or even T&T, I could have gotten more dumplings and food.  My dad would have swatted me in the head with a rolled up Sing Tao if he knew what I paid for that lunch!

If that Nations Supermarket ever opens up in the Stockyards, I'll be heading there for my dim sum!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend their roasted duck: fresh, juicy, perfect! 
Owners are very friendly.
I will definitely re order the duck and try more items."}
{"text":"I spotted this new place driving by and decided to pop in. I was disappointed at their selection, especially the bao. The woman working was super friendly. I left with a ton of dumplings and sesame balls, which were outstanding."}
