{"text":"If your from Cali and are looking for \"King Taco\" or \"El Taurino\" for all of you that grew up on Hoover & Olympic this is the spot u want to go, to get that delicious flavor!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazingly reasonable prices for home taste food. Friendly, clean and awesome natural fruit drinks like orchata, mango, guava, naranjada. Breakfast menu is great, I've tried 4 of the burritos on the menu and they are good grubb!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food, great natural fruit drinks. Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal"}
{"text":"Tacos are always good, but I was very disappointed because they didn't had any Toriados, my husband and I love them. But they did have them.  How do they don't have Totiados?"}
{"text":"I get the carnitas tacos with a side of chips (approx $6). Load up on the free sauce and veggies, and head out. The food is always good and it tastes good too. As good as Chipolte and half the price, this is my go-to lunch spot near CSN."}
{"text":"I love their carne asada quezadilla which I drench in their green sauce. They also have a great variety of aguas frescas(I personally am a fan of their fresa agua). I have also tried the tostadas de ceviche(they make their own tostada) and tortas ahogadas. I have to say that I live close by so have come to know the owner who makes sure we get what we want and already knows the way we like our food. I try to go when I know she is working."}
{"text":"Clean, great customer service, agua fresca pretty good all natural. Prices are comparable to Roberto taco shop. I ordered Super Nachos carne asada. There's plenty of meat and beans all though I thought the portion was big enough for two it was small. The food is made to order and the kitchen seems to be clean."}
{"text":"Great customer service, and best of all, great food!!! Their \"agua frescas\" are always made daily.. I've tried em all lol very delicious. They have different flavors every day."}
{"text":"Sorry I have to update my review after last night .  I came here a little late last night about 8:30pm which is right before closing.  I understand the cook might be a little irritated but don't sit in the booths upfront and look annoyed when you are at work and actually have to get up and DO SOMETHING.  I ordered two bean and cheese burritos the cashier was short and rude.  I got home and got halfway through my burrito when I took a bite and pulled out a chili stem!!!! Ewwww. It looked like the cook took a bite abd threw it right in my burrito!!! I was soooooo mad and disgusted. Immediately lost my appetite and went back and received my refund.  Needless to say I'm sorry I WILL NOT BE BACK..."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food restaurant, excellent service, super clean, delicious food, the waters of the best and always variety of flavors ... Totally recommended I always take my friends and family to that place and then come back, I've already tried everything and it's always hard to choose because I like everything"}
{"text":"I come to this place often, is a small place but looks clean .. weekends also have menudo, authentic Mexican menudo"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best carne asada tacos in vegas"}
{"text":"great fresh fruit juice. carne asada burritos are the best. homemade fresh salsa everyday. homemade tortilla chips. can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"delicious food!  The meat is seasoned to perfection.  Broad variety of aguas frescas.  Try the tacos de asada mixed with chorizo."}
{"text":"Inexpensive great food. Awesome burritos."}
{"text":"I being coming  here since I was a kid and it was my first time coming to this location and I love it. The sauce was so good it wasn't to spicy but it had that Mexican home made touch that's rare to find. I got one taco al pastor and some Spicy shrimp and the shrimps were so juicy and big. The lady at front was so nice and sweet I asked her which sauce was spicer and she answered and was so polite doing so. I will definitely come again ."}
{"text":"Been going to this place since I move to Vegas. I can never go wrong with any of their items. Staff is nice which helps too. Cant go wrong with their drinks either. My favorite is their Melon juice or the typical Horchata. It doesnt look like I will ever stop going back for more food there."}
{"text":"Love this food !!  great Mexican food !!  good costumer services and love there fresh water !!   very clean clean place   I like all the food here !! I've been to other similar Resturant but different vibe and style but this one make you feel welcomed"}
{"text":"Best birria! I love the tacos there, their food is the bomb, except for the customer sevice.. does girls don't greet. Other than this place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to eat.  Now I'm not so sure that I want to eat here again I found a piece of meat in my veggie burrito. I know it was an accident but please if you're making a veggie burrito maybe don't wrap it near the meat."}
{"text":"This place is great,customer service friendly cashier bomb food, I had a burrito with carne asada ricr and beans and cheese ,two tacos one cabeza  (which was delish )and lengua (soft tender juicy goodness ) their salsas are awesome *my favorite the verse one* but both are really good #tacoslostoritos are life!!"}
{"text":"We're just going through town for a couple days and always want something off the beaten path, this was a great find. Really nice staff, good prices and great food!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place twice now with my family (kids as well)and the food is always great. I love the salsas not only are they hot but have flavor which is hard to find a restaurant with both. The agua frescas it taste so freshly made. Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"These are the best carne asada street tacos in all vegas #1 and believe me I know. Packed with meat and finely chopped. The best."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I walked in no greeting and no one else in line. Hispanic guy walk in right behind me and and the girl behind the counter speaks to him and just starts helping him and fixing an order for him without saying a word to me. And looked me dead in my face and still didn't say a word so I left out. Will not support this place. Appeared to me racists towards blacks as I am an African American. You've been warned. I wouldn't support this place if I was use. Plenty of other taco spots. Wish I could leave -10 star"}
{"text":"Love this place. There breakfast burritos are the best in town. I have also use them for catering. I usually get their  2 hardshell tacos with rice and beans combo. I also had there enchiladas which are very tasty. We usually get it to go but when we do decide to eat there it's always clean and service is great."}
{"text":"I came here for the first about a month ago and i was looking for tacos and i have to admit there tacos are delightful flavorful and not too pricey. But theres only one downside to this place there restaurant smells like straight bathrooms like there sewer lines are all fucked up from the time i went to open the front door to the time i left i swear the whole restaurant stinks so bad i suggest if you eat here order to go because i wouldn't want to eat in a place that smells bad"}
{"text":"Good food and a great price but definitely not a go to for me but I do stop by every often I crave tacos and their Agua Frescas are bomb!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, nothing has ever been less then amazing. Great inexpensive food and great customer service!!"}
{"text":"had carne asada burrito was not that good definitely had better customer service was shitty & wouldnt try again ."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm working on this side of town I need stop in and me some of their tacos de tripa!!! They have the BEST tripas I've ever tasted. I always ordered them extra crunchy.   They used to have a location on West Charleston and when I found out it closed I was super disappointed. I happened to be working on the East side one day and needed a Starbucks so mapped the closest one to me and as was pulling into the Starbucks entrance after passing it, out of the corner of my eyes, I see the Taco sign and my face must have lite up like a Christmas tree!! My new mission was to eat me some tacos and forgot all about my original plan for a Starbucks drink."}
{"text":"Last night driving by after a 9 hours drive i spot this place tacos  were good yes little pricy but good flavor better than el gordos  moving to Las Vegas this place will become one of my stops clean and nice service"}
{"text":"I use to like coming here but went there last night and was disappointed. The tables were dirty. And very bad customer service the cashier had a attitude when I asked her something. Won't be going back here that's for sure."}
{"text":"Toritos Burritos are good just not as good as Doritos or even Mojitos but they do a good job on their food. The carne asada fries are delicious and the quesadillas, though simple are really good also. The service is fine and they do a good job of keeping the place clean."}
{"text":"Second time here, first time I ordered the cabeza burrito. It was cook well and even though it was around 8:pm the meat tasted delicious. This time I ordered the fish filet plate. The filet was fresh and tasty. The beans and rice filled me up as well. My mom had the caldo de res. She said it was very good, this coming from a Mexican cook.  I also had the guayava water as well which was on point!!!!  I highly recommend this place, if you're in the area for lunch stop by!!"}
{"text":"Tacos Los toritos is our go to spot for fast Mexican food. I'd come here over a nasty Robertos any day! I've tried a lot of there food and for the most part it's all good. The shrimp tacos aren't all that but they're good. Today I ordered a quesadilla de asada and taco de cabeza combo. Which comes with a side of salad, beans, rice and chips. Their salsas are good and their Aguas Frescas are the bomb. Best horchata you've had! (FYI I always take my food to go. Never really sat to eat there)"}
{"text":"2 1/2  stars very mediocre Mexican food no flavor, salsa is way too mild, never thought Mexican food could be this bland.  This place closes at midnight on weekdays and 2am on weekends.  Really bad neighborhood don't go there after dark!"}
{"text":"100% Authentic Mexican Food. Fresh, delicious! Clean restaurant, with great salsa bar. Assortment of home made agua frescas. The chicken tacos are to die for, and I loved their Piña ( pineapple) agua fresca. 5/5 will return for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was five years old the food is amazing they have the best agua fresca quality of the food is consistent in their other locations"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and the same experience occurs every time. Food is good, but the employees always seem like they just don't want your business. The business hours listed online are not correct, they always close early. Forget about calling in for a pick up order. They take the phone order(which is taken by a lady that can barely speak English), but don't respect their customers enough to make the food before you get there. They don't make the food until after you pay no matter. So, calling in is pointless because you still have to wait the same amount of time when you get there. It's just a funny way they run their business. I will still continue to go here because I like their food and it's down the street from my house, but customer service is NO BUENO!"}
{"text":"this handsdown id say is the best mexican food everything is awesome. this place is well worth a visit if you love great mexican,food and the green sauce. wow amazing. id suggest shreded beef no 1 taco and burrito shredded beef with everything i guarantee it"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant but some of the light fixtures were missing their covers. Both background music and the TV we're on at the same time which made for a very noisy environment. We had burritos and tacos. I thought the burrito was heavy on the onion. Tacos were good. Flan was fair, and I like a little more syrup."}
{"text":"The amount of random taco shops in Vegas is quite daunting. Usually the shredded beef is a safe bet on an initial visit because it might not always be the best, but there is less of a chance of fatty meat appearing than say the Carne Asada. Anyway, i ordered three $1.25 tacos of that beef and this was actually really flavorful stuff loaded onto double corn tortillas and grilled with a few peppers and tomatoes (unusual). There was no sauce on top, but cilantro and chopped onions topped off the tacos. They really put alot of beef on them and three will last you awhile especially if you load up on the cold radishes (not green either) and the kinda spicy carrots. Red and green salsa were traditional. Almost five stars, but the walls were kinda dirty next to my booth. Still a great lunch for 4 bucks."}
{"text":"This is my go to Mexican restaurant.. Everything is really good and my absolute favorite is there Beria"}
{"text":"UPDATE 3/3/10:  Recently went back and tried their chicken quesadilla and ceviche tostada.  Both were excellent! Serving sizes are generous and food quality is way above average.  Still highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I loved their Agua Fresca drinks and it was close by but as I drove by today it appears they are closed.  I called the number as well and it was disconnected."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service!!! The verde salsa is so good!!! I got the carne asada and carnitas tacos meal to go. The tacos are stuffed FULL! And they are very tasty (got mine without sauce so I could add my own) The only thing I wish they would do for to-go orders is wrap the tacos in foil so the tortillas don't get wet and soggy."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my cousin. So today, I finally tried this place out. I bought the carne asada tacos (2) and my husband got the carne asada burrito. It was sooo delicious!!!! Don't know why I haven't tried this place sooner! Found my new spot... Bye bye Robertos, hello Tacos Los Toritos!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a humbug...son want tacos, he's really picky!  We went in, nice little clean place!   We ordered 3- beef tacos, and the $5.99 burrito.   My son likes burritos.  We got the order to go, and I got the flavored fruit waters.  All came to $15 and some change.  Talk about some really great food!  My son told me \"this\" is his NEW place for tacos.  My 2-tacos had so much meat on them...also has chips inside of the bag.  Great value!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly the food and service was really good. Staff was very friendly and they do not hold out when it comes to the carne asada!"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch all the time! Clean, orderly authentic restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere. Lots of room for groups and the staff is always friendly. Price is a little higher compared to other fast food style Mexican restaurants in the area (about $10/person for a full combo meal) but worth it. Carnitas is the best meat on the menu (al pastor and carne asada are sub-par)"}
{"text":"These guys have some awesome flavors with great portion sizes. I can never finish my food! I will continue to return."}
{"text":"Actually one of the best mexican restaurants on the Eastside! I love it there! Great food and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"This place is a real find. One of the best places for Mexican on the east side. Everything is fresh. The juices, the fish, the tortillas, everything. I have had the tortas, tacos, enchiladas, I'm always satisfied. The fish taco has numerous pieces of fried fish sticks that I always want to pick out of my taco and eat them plain they're so good. And something about the green salsa here gets me every time. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is cuz they are a little dirty. I've never wanted to sit and eat here. Doesn't mean I haven't but I prefer to get it Togo."}
{"text":"Love all of there food,  taste it's good,the amount is satisfying and it's made in a reasonable time!"}
{"text":"I'm a Vegetarian so I'm always happy when I see the word \"Veggie\" (in any language!) and the Vegetariano Burrito totally fit the script.  I came here after school one day with only a few dollars in my pocket hoping to find something that was a little cheaper than the $600.00 cookie they sell in the University cafeteria (I'm kidding about the price ...but seriously it's like this big *hand motion* and stupidly expensive...!)  Anyway.   I was extremely happy to find this place a few blocks away.  I used to take classes at CSN (it's right across the street) so I can't believe I never noticed it before.  So I went inside and was extremely pleased with everything.  The place is clean and the staff speak English (always a plus ...though I do speak pretty fluent spanish so I guess it really doesn't matter lol.)    The Vegetariano Burrito was extremely tasty.  It was BIG too,which I liked, especially for the price.  I'd reccomend it even for meat-eaters.  I've since come here almost weekly (or more) and they've always had my order quickly and never gotten it wrong.  Oh, and try the juices on the counter - their Horchata is very good, but I'm a big fan of the Naranjo myself!!  (They also have a TV with various Spanish soaps playing...if you want to stick around.)"}
{"text":"No thank you. I'll tell you straight out I will not be back here again. When it comes to mom and pop taco shops like these, it's all in their meat and how well they marinate it.  My boyfriend and I ordered 3 carne asada tacos and carne asada fries. The meat was tasteless...even when I drenched my taco in the red AND green sauce.  The carne asada fries was nothing worth mentioning. It was boring and tasteless."}
{"text":"Me and my family come here when we want \"real\" Mexican food. This place is the best. Food is so home feeling. They are always so nice too!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for about 2 years. I absolutely love their food. Everything is flavorful; the salsa is spicy and flavorful, the meat is well seasoned, and the agua frescas are definitely my favorite. They are made fresh, and as sweet as I like them."}
{"text":"This place is delicious   This is my second time here.  The food comes out pretry quickly. Their combo plates are super filling.  Their meets are well marinated.my favorite so far is the Buche  They have a large array of delicious juices. And they change out the flavors.   Haven't had enough space in my belly for dessert too- but they have some!   They are super friendly here.   The only down sdes are you can't order mixed meats or the cooked jalapeños and onions as a side- they do include this in their combo plates though!  They also have a pretty small salsa bar- red and green salsa, pickled onions/carrots/cauliflower, and radishes    Coming back again to try more of their options !"}
{"text":"I found this place one day by chance! And loved it! It has the best tacos in town! Luv the meat!! Everywhere i go to get tacos de asada the meat has gross fat on it that i stay chewing for hours (yuck)! The people here are friendly and its super clean. Everyone always asks me where do u eat mexican food at? I cook my own but here it is, the place I luv!  Forget tacos el gordos  that place is gross!! I have to travel but thats ok!"}
{"text":"I go to this place at least 3 times a week . They have amazing food, my current favorites are, Torta Milanesa, tacos de asada and burrito de asada. But I've tried alot of things there, and they are all really good, their Aguas are delicious as well. Just an amazing place."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall tacos where you are the only American is always a thrill for me.  Solo in MEXICO....si senor, gracias and mucho gracias.   yes, no work , gringos allowed if they are cool like me.....I loved this hometown mexican fare, they nailed it, it would get 5 stars if it was served on plates, but I get it....solid, but not a 5.....the price is a 5 for sure....easy money, easy day....fresh tacos on the way!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas, why you no have good taco shops?   Look I get it, \"craft tacos\" are super cool right now, but every now and then I want a taco made with love, lard, and a possible an old family recipe. So far, I have yet to come across this in the Valley. I had high hopes Tacos Los Toritos especially after seeing their four star rating, but alas it was just flavorless tacos, refried beans from a can, and overcooked rice. This meal could have a been a \"Taco Tuesday\", lunch special at the local junior high cafeteria.   I ordered the taco & burrito meal, with carnitas. The taco was ok, made street style with two small corn tortillas, seared onions, and carnitas. The tortilla was not house made, but it did hold together while I ate my taco. The carnitas were juicy, but lacked flavor and crunch. To my understanding carnitas are cooked until tender then seared in a hot pan to get them a little crispy. I know this sounds picky, but most taco shops get this right, but unfortunately this was not the case at Tacos Los Toritos.   The burrito was more of the same, flavorless meat and canned beans, more beans than meat by the way. The was size ok, but does that matter if the taste doesn't match the size? I did however like their green verde salsa, this was very good and I drenched most of my food in this green mixture of tamatillos, chilis and spices.   Sad to say I will not be coming back to Tacos Los Toritos. My search for a quality taco shop in Vegas continues!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. I ordered the burrito taco combo with shredded beef. The ingredients were very fresh from the salsa to the homemade drinks up front. If your getting a car wash next door it's a great place to grab a bite. Very good!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  I think I've just been spoiled by Los Tacos' carne asada.  This place wasn't bad, but I probably would choose somewhere else first.  Their burritos are full of beans and rice.  I just want the meat!"}
{"text":"For Las Vegas it's great! When I saw that there was a Los Toritos tacos here I was so happy! and sketchy because I wanted to know if they tasted as good as the one here where I used to live. I ate the food and oh man it was real good! Iv'e ate gorditas, taco de asad, buche, carnitas, tortas, burrito. Everything tastes REAL GOOD! Good location, plenty of parking. Close to my HOUSE! The retsaurant is clean and big. It came out to be a whole lot better than the one in my home town! Want to know why? Because went I went back to my home town and ate here, I loved the flavor of the other Los Torritos restaurant!     Good prices, I think it is a lot cheaper than the one in L.A. Not so sure on that, but will check it. The food comes out fast so no worries there. Alright amount of people there all the time so you know it's good. Never have gone to the bathroom tho, I avoid that... Now after living in L.A for 21 yrs and to be convinced by another restaurant in the family... Now that's a work out! Eating of course... So I aften came to place whenever I could not find any better mexican food. They place was a real life saver for me and my family lol."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't put a half a star. Ok first off I just got in town to visit family and this was the only place open. We arrived at 1130pm when they close at midnight. They were cleaning and yes establishment was clean. The lady behind the counter was nice and to be honest good service. When she asked for here or to go we said here. As the food was ready in 5 minutes she said sorry we are closing and we can't allow you to stay for security purposes. So understanding they are closing and people have families to go home too I get it. But I drove to my family's house and all that device out the window when we looked at our food. I order asada tacos and a cheese enchilada plate. First off it wasn't Asada tacos they put some meat that looked like last years thanksgiving turkey. I tried one and it tasted like salt and ass. The cheese enchilada looked like a day old left over drenched in salad water. I spent $20 there and it was the worst. We were the last customers when they can shut the doors on us and not answer phones. They may have great service in the day but this literally defined there establishment work ethic and $20 I'll never get back. I'll post pics of the tacos I have no idea what that was. No I'm curious to find out what animal that was. Don't eat here at the\"end of the day\" you won't get service and food quality a human being deserves. I'll post a pic of there version of asada tacos that was Frankensteined together."}
{"text":"The people are friendly the food is always satisfying and the agua frescas are delicious. When i'm on that side of town its the only place I go to eat at."}
{"text":"Food sometimey, one day it might be a hit one day it might be a miss, but one thing forsure it stinks like hell in this joint, somebody really needs to check on that, especially if folks are eating out of here.the one on Maryland parkway is 10 times cleaner and the food Taste a lot better"}
{"text":"Wow!! Best Mexican Food I've had in Vegas! taste is great , perfectly cooked and great presentation!!"}
{"text":"After a busy morning of plumbing problems and a trip to the library, my Mimi and I found ourselves starving on the morning of Christmas Eve. We pulled into the strip mall, caught sight of the neighboring Taco Bell, and agreed that would suffice should we not find anything else.  Well, we found Tacos Los Toritos, and it beats Taco Bell any day.   It's a lovely little shop with an extensive menu. I ordered the veggie burrito with chips and my Mimi the fish tacos and rice. We looOOOoooved the food. It was fresh, delicious, authentic--everything you want and need in a taco shop!  The staff were friendly and quick with getting the food out to us. We ended up getting a couple burritos to go for my aunt and cousin, which were met with joy and praise.   So in short, skip Taco Bell. Go to Tacos Los Toritos."}
{"text":"I love their food is one of the best Mexican cooking . Also the cashiers are always so nice. Love this place"}
{"text":"Not the best food but still pretty good and decently priced."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food.  I offer come for the fish tacos but occasionally have one of their hearty soups. I choose either Pozole or Caldo de Res . And always have one of their large drinks of horchata or cantaloupe . The food is always great and the service is friendly. The only drawback is slow service . It's mostly due to a small staff ..one counter person who has a lot to do. But that shouldn't stop you from coming here.  Reasonable prices, and plenty parking as it is next to Smiths groceries. Outdoor seating is also available ."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for about 7 years. I usually always get the carne asada quesadilla combo which comes with beans/rice and a taco or the carne asada fries with extra cheese. This place has the BEST carne asada fries in town, hands down! Their fries are well seasoned and the carne asada is delicious. The price is around $9 but it's big enough for two persons or two meals, same thing with the quesadillas. Their portions are  so big so the price is very much worth it. My husband usually gets the carne asada burrito and loves it! I don't recommend their enchiladas or menudo, they lack seasoning. The staff here is also very friendly and polite. I usually always order over the phone and come down 10 minutes later to pick it up, my meals are always made on time and I usually never have to wait for my take out."}
{"text":"I love this place and it's right down the street from my house. All of their juices are extra tasty and I normally get the carne asada tacos which are very good as well. The salsa is great, too!"}
{"text":"Their food is cheap but yet on grub hub its a $35 minimum?!?!?? There's no way 2 people can order that much as a minimum. each entree is about $8 by the time u get sides it's only $25 or so. It's unfair to those who actually want to eat your food. There's not many Mexican places that deliver  and they would corner the market."}
{"text":"I adored the fun jugs of aqua frescas along the front counter! So good.  In fact you can sample some before you decide on your favorite.  The food is really good.  In the event that you are craving some legit Mexican food this is no doubt my new fav.  I do have to say that the true test for me is the rice and beans.  AMAZING! They have some really tasty rice and beans here. I ordered the gordita combo w/ a carnita taco.  It was HUGE. The portions here are insane.  I love that.  I also was a little disappointed in the gordita because where I come from it's a homemade soft corn puff taco and this was a deep fried torta of some sort.  I was not familiar with it and it was not appetizing but the filling was great.  I just didn't eat the two deep fried saucers it came with and it was still very delish. The corn toritlla carnita taco w/ a full fix of toppings was so fat I could barely close it to eat. It was so good and filling!!!  I can't get over the value of the food here.  Its so affordable, delicious and the service is great.  The best part for me was the supersized $2 drink of aqua fresca!  The drink was supersized but called Regular and I think next time I'll get the bigger one because it was one of the best parts of the meal.  And in this desert heat you can't pass up an ultra refreshing fresa(strawberry) aqua fresca that you can enjoy long after the meal."}
{"text":"I came here recommended by some one, and I was NOT DISAPPOINTED, my husband and I loved this place, not only was the food awesome and great portion sizes, but the lovely cashier, Monica, was beyond words, she made our visit so special! What a lovely person! Monica, si algun dia lees esto, GRACIAS! Ojala hubieran mas personas como tu en Este mundo!"}
{"text":"Very very dissapointed with this place! I woke up craving Pazole & I decided to try Yelp & this is what popped up. I called around 8am & whoever answered the phone didn't understand English because she thought I ordered 2 Large Pozoles. I didn't I asked her if she had Pazole & if they were open she said \"maybe in 20 minutes\" and she asked if I wanted Pazole & what size.  So I figured they were going to get started & prepare it fresh, when we got there the Pazole was already bagged to go but I didn't ask for it to go I wanted to eat there so we finally sat asked for 2 bowls & had to pour the hot soup into the bowls. I was so dissapointed because for the price we paid for the soup it was so watery & instead of meat we mostly got bones & fat! I was upset but I ate because I didn't wanna waste the food  Oh they give you lettuce instead of cabagge for your Pazole which I thought was odd....epic fail we won't be going back ever again"}
{"text":"The smell once you walk in just screams authentic. The lime green walls and pictures of fresh meals set you up for a good vibe.   I went with the tacos de pescado. The fish was tender and well prepared. But here's the kicker, the absolute best part wad the fresh lemonade. Seriously WOW. For the price you pay, the food portions are more then fair."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to the restaurant and this place is delicious.  The al pastor tacos are some of the best I have had.  I have tried the al pastor, asada, carnitas, chicharron and pollo and all are very good.  Great little Mexican restaurant that is making authentic and tasty food."}
{"text":"This place is very clean and the food is great. In my opinion way better than the taco chain out here that has massive lines. This is definitely a well kept secret!"}
{"text":"Most disgusting food ever don't go Nast with long hairs call the fu!!ing health de apartment that Nasty gross look at my pictures f@@@ing nasty ass food with hairs most likely from a females they were long f$$$ing people don't go nasty nasty nasty beware hairs I food 3 long hairs I found"}
{"text":"There are times when I'm not going to throw down $25 for a buffet in Vegas, okay, every time.  And there are times where I'll slum it at some hole in wall, okay, most times! lol  Such was the case last week in Vegas.  I was there for the Interbike convention and the first two days where spent riding very expensive bikes in the hot hills of Boulder, after the second day I really wanted something basic...  A taco.  A plate of tacos!  So I headed south from the Sands where I dropped off a bike and departed my buddies, I remember some eat places over on Flamingo so I thought I'd find the same on Sands Blvd.  Not the case.  I passed this strip mall and saw a sign that featured tacos, I dove for the lot!  \"Tacos Los Toritos\" is a medium size place, the seating was limited to one half the place as one of the workers was scrubbing down the floor of the other half, love that Pine-Sol!!  Good size menu with lots of choices, but I knew I needed tacos pronto so I ordered up from the sweet semi-bilingual girl behind the counter.  4 carnitas tacos...  And an orange pop, Jarritos, which I love!  This plate reminded me of home near Highland Park and all the taco trucks to choose from.  Tacos hit the spot and all was had for $7 bucks...  I needed to conserve funds as I didn't fair so well at the tables, so, this place was key in more ways than one!  Well, just 2 stars because I've had tastier pork, the salsa was also more on the tame side.  If I ever stop here again I'll ask for hotter salsa.  Oh, and as I walked to my truck I caught the eye of a girl walking on the sidewalk...  HOOKER!  lol"}
{"text":"So the food is good but the consistency sucks. I am working on a house nearby and stopped in for lunch got an order of tacos, the cashier asked if I wanted cilantro and onion, i also ordered cheese on the side, all was well.  Later I went when I left my job site I stopped in the second time, they added hot sauce and salsa to my tacos, I'm allergic to tomatoes, so when I complained this cashier took my food back with much resistance and the presentation for the fixed food was less than desirable... It was basically labeled GTFO"}
{"text":"They have the best tacos & burritos ever do love mines with the ten hot sauce. The meat has such a great flavor. I eat here at least once or twice a week."}
{"text":"I have this philosophy about recipes at restaurants being uniquely their own version of dishes. I grew up on Roberto's in Las Vegas and to me that is casual Mexican food. Tacos Los Toritos is another universe for some people and I totally dig it.   The east side of Las Vegas, to me, is anywhere east of Eastern and TLT has some of my favorite street tacos on the east side. Street tacos aka just meat, onion, cilantro, and salsa-nothing fancy. My favorites are their lengua and their tripas. They give you the option of soft or crunchy and their crunchy tripas is the way to go.   Aside from tacos they have your traditional plate meals with rice and beans, your covered fries or nachos, and your hangover cures like menudo.  What stands out for me at this taco shop versus other places is there agua frescas. These are delicious, refreshing, and made in house. Their horchata isn't my favorite, but try any of their other offerings and you won't be disappointed. My favorite is the cucumber.  One thing people may have a love or hate opinion on is their pickled carrots and jalapeños. They are very mildy pickled and spicy which I happen to like. They aren't like the canned ones I'm used to.   I know this place is a staple on the east side, but even if you don you live on this side of town, they're worth a trip."}
{"text":"Great food, solid service and surprisingly clean for the neighborhood it's in. I tried the number 2 which is a taco and a Gordita. Freshly cooked great flavor."}
{"text":"Found this place on accident & it has become my regular breakfast & lunch spot while here on business ! Great breakfast burritos - great lunch options ! And the Fresh fruit juices are soooo yummy ! Every time I'm here on business I will stop here & I will recommend this place to all my friends & coworkers !!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times, both pre-carnivore and now as a pescatarian.. or whatever you want to call it. I love seafood.  The tacos are great while everything else is pretty standard fare. The al pastor and carnitas are fantastic, but the carne asada was too fine in texture for me. They chop it so it's almost like a ground beef it's so small. The fish tacos are made with tilapia which in my opinion taste kind of like dirt. The thyme in the seasoning on it didn't help with that. The beans are rice are meh.  They have a good salsa bar with fresh citrus, spicy pickled carrots and cauliflower, your standard red and green sauces. But the highlight of the place is the frescos.  The juices they have available in the glass jugs up front are fantastically fresh and cold. Yes, they are stupid sweet, but during summer.. there are few things better than these sweet icy cold fresh fruit concoctions. Come for a couple tacos and the frescos!"}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos are wonderful here, same with the tacos al pastor. Plus, at $1.35 a taco, you can't go wrong. Food is not overly greasy, which my heart can thank me later for. During my stop here, I've had the chance to try:  -Carne Asada Tacos: Carne asada is seasoned well, making it rich and flavorful. Probably some of the best I've had in town. -Tacos al Pastor:  While not as memorable as the carne asada, it's still a very solid taco. Good, but not awesome. -Carne Asada burrito: I managed to get a bite of this from whom I was eating with. It's basically what you get in a taco, in burrito form (with rice, beans, etc.). Much too heavy for me, so I'd rather stick with the tacos.  All in all, a solid trip. I would eat here again, but wouldn't go out of my way for this place.  I'd call this place radius eating: If I'm in the area, then definitely I'll make an effort to stop on by for a bite."}
{"text":"WOW! Pleasantly surprised! A nice clean restaurant, with great service, and EXCELLENT food!  We came here at the request of one of our friends. Gave it a second thought because of the surrounding area. But when we saw the clean new shopping center we were a little more comforted. Then completely surprised by the clean interior of the restaurant. We were then greeted with a smile by the friendly cashier who asked us clarifying questions (I guess it was pretty obvious I didn't speak Spanish). The food took a bit to come out, but not so long that it affected our lunch period. The food was nice, hot, and seemingly fresh! VERY GOOD! Would definitely come back and recommend!"}
{"text":"I work in this part of town and end up here on a pretty regular basis. they try to play themselves off as \"Mexican fast food\" but they are far from. their food quality surpasses anything in their category (Roberto's, don't tortaco etc.) the service is friendly and the food is priced very reasonably. their tacos are fantastic and cheap. the burritos are about the size and weight of a newborn infant. the caldo de res is always there for me to nurse my hangover. they have a large selection of agua frescas and Mexican style sodas but no fountain drinks. also their salsa bar is way spicier and more flavorful than any other taco shop. I've been there many times and will be back many more."}
{"text":"jamaica juice is so refreshing! I ordered their papas con carne, which is pretty much carne asada fries. The carne asada meat was so soft, no chewy parts at all, compared to Roberto's. You can't compare though because each it made differently. My brother ordered Chile Releno, which was served on a fancy clay plate!  We were very happy with our meals, price, and their service."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of food, very friendly service !!  I can tell this place is a lot more authentic compared to Chipotle or Robertos. They have fried fish head for crying out loud! Which is actually a popular dish at this place. It's right across from CSN Charleston campus, which is why when my friends and I are tired of Denny's or Tropical Smoothie, we go here instead. No matter what you order you HAVE TO try the different flavored juices they offer on the counter. I've tried Pineapple, Orange, and Watermelon. I stray away from Horchata since I've never really developed a liking for it :( Their watermelon was the BOMB! I kept coming back for refills! The first time I went here I got their enchiladas. The portion and sides of this dish never disappoints!   I can't believe this place isn't that well-known. But seeing  Latino families come here on a daily basis tells me this place is legit. Being open 'til midnight also helps for those hangovers I guess lol!"}
{"text":"I had the enchiladas which were absolutely disgusting. The sauce tasted like tomato paste with absolutely no flavor. The cheese was not melted on the inside and then they piled on the Oaxaca cheese which all combined was horrible. I had to go have them microwave my plate to melt it and still no good. Boyfriend ordered carnitas tacos which were ok and we ordered shredded beef taquitos which were covered in a cilantro sauce. The sauce just tasted like pulverized cilantro yuck! Will not be returning to this place again!"}
{"text":"Very small limited menu, very confusing. Took me awhile to find out they had carne asada. The Tacos aren't so bad but it definitely lacked flavor. The meat was dry but they did over stuff it with veggies but no guacamole :(   Wouldn't go back unless I was starving."}
{"text":"I had the combo #1 which is a burrito, taco, rice and chips. It comes with beans too but I never get beans. I loved the taste of the soft taco it was tasty! I wasn't a big fan of the Carne Asada burrito because it was too salty for me and they put rice in the burrito . I do LOVE their Watermelon Juice with a capital \"L\" ! It's sweet but oh so perfect on a hot Las Vegas day! I can drink my weight in it ....that's a lot of juice!"}
{"text":"Basically it's comfort food at its best for me. The prices are reasonable, the service is great and most of all the food is very good."}
{"text":"We were driving around the area saw this place decided to give it a shot. Glad we did because the food was delicious! Horchata was also  homemade. Best I ever had! We both ordered the gordita with taco plate."}
{"text":"Great spot for late night eats. The carne asada tacos were street taco size, and were filled with delicious marinated beef. They were $1.50 each. We also had some horchata, which wasn't super sweet like how other kinds can get, and was very cool and refreshing. I didn't see any hours posted on the door, but we were there on a Saturday night at 11 P.M. and they were still open."}
{"text":"This is a good lil mom and pops shop .. Tacos are tasty... And i like the fact its just right across to the gym haha i cant believe i never hit this place up sooner ... Food is cheap and tasty cant complain plus the girl at register was really nice :) will defently be back ...."}
{"text":"The food here is great. The servings are huge! Everything is good quality and you can see the food being made in front of you which (I think) is very important. Although it can get a little pricey (cost of extras), I know that I'm getting some good Mexican food every time.  Why 4 stars instead of 5? I like the original location better.. just because it's closer. :P"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some Mexican food and what better are then the east side!   This restaurant is very clean nice decor is nothing out of the normal I was extremely surprised by how neat and clean it is.  The prices are not bad at all they have a variety of combo specials that are a ton of food at most your pay 20 for a plate and this is the most expensive meal including sides.   I ordered a vegetarian burrito that included crema, cheese, avocado, beans, and more. I also had a delicious agua Fresca made out of agua vana Definitely recommend this it is amazing!!!!   Total was was not out rages, like I said if you have a craving for Mexican food and are in the area pass by here."}
{"text":"When reviewing an eatery, I always consider the overall value.  At $1.50 a taco (carne asada and al pastor), I've gotta say I've had way better for less cost.  The carne asada lacked any unique flavor.  It merely tastes like meat.  I would have appreciated a slight lime or chile flavoring of sort.  Heck, I'd take a salty peppery taste (the easiest to achieve without messing up the taco).    The al pastor had a nice sweetness to contrast the slight spiciness; however, the meat and the onion and pineapple mixture had all turned to mush.  The taco lacked the basic \"meat\" texture a taco needs to make it feel like you're eating a taco.  I also ordered a fish taco ($2.00) which was alright.  It wasn't battered and deep fried (Baja style) but grilled instead.  The fish flavor was present, but, much like the carne asada, there was no real seasoning to set this taco apart from any ol' taco place.  The tacos were standard street size (fit in the palm of your hand, double tortilla).   The place was really clean.  The green and red salsa were GREAT with the complimentary chips I received.    Overall, this place isn't terrible or anything.  It's just nothing to rave about.  If you're looking to get your taco fix, you can get it here (I just can't justify paying more than $1.00-1.25 per taco....yes, 25 cents makes a BIG difference, especially when ordering for a family)."}
{"text":"Upon entering, a nice clean environment in comparison to other taco / Mexican joints around the north/east side of town. They have a nice variety of what seemed to be fresh agua frescas, and even some rare ones like banana fresca and pepino (cucumber). I ordered 4 tacos, ($2 tacos each), and my lady ordered a burrito ($6.99 I believe). 4 stars because the burrito comes how it comes without even asking if she wanted hot sauce in it or not, and it was a little too hot for her. All in all, it was pretty good. Nothing too different tasting, but still good."}
{"text":"If you like crunchy potato wedges along with asada, cheese, guac, and sour cream all together; get their carne asada fries! Great service and clean place!"}
{"text":"Good authentic mexican food and fast service. Great stop for lunch. Eat at these places instead of McDonald's and Jack in the Box!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing try the Al Pastor...and the Agua frescas so yummy the best in town! we also used them to cater a recent event and it was such a hit! and the prices are so resonable"}
{"text":"Great food all of the time!  Just posting a review for any fellow VEGANS: Rice and beans are NOT VEGAN."}
{"text":"The Best Burritos is Las Vegas hands down!!!! Great service and great prices!!! Everything on the menu is great!!! The Carne Asada tacos are amazing too!!!! I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is authentic and oh so delicious. Their aguas frescas are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 18 years and the quality of everything on the menu has not changed, still the best tacos I've had in Vegas. The tacos de asada are the best and the aguas frescas are all delicious."}
{"text":"Big surprise here. We ducked in here on a whim and are very glad we did. First off, knowing I'd be yelping about this place I took an exterior photo of Tacos Los Toritos. As I was snapping the shot, some guys were just starting to walk out. Going for the laugh, one dude struck a pose, for the shot. We all got a real good laugh out of that. It made for a good first impression, happy, goofy customers. Loved it. Inside the place is bright and cheery, nothing fancy, but welcoming and sprinkled with art reflecting the old country. They make a nice array of fruit drinks (large $2.25), made with a base of freshly squeezed fruit-orange, watermelon, and my favorite...cantaloupe--I loved the cantaloupe. They also serve up ho-made horchata too. Free samples? No problem. For some reason fish was sounding good. I order up a ceviche tostada ($2.99). It was loaded with fish (tilapia?) and burst with a rockin' spicy, citrusy, flavor. The gal behind the counter was very helpful and mentioned the fish tacos ($1.50) as being popular. They create their own breading mix there, and the tacos came out with a delightfully light crispy crust, served with lettuce and tomato on small double wrapped corn tortillas. I prefer cabbage, but didn't miss it at all with these bad boys. Chille Relleno with rice and beans ($7.40)...also delish. A decent condiment stand tops it all off with a couple of salsas, limes, radishes, and a nice surprise of spicy hot roasted serrano chili peppers and onions. We were there during the non peak time of about 1:30 on a Sunday. They had a steady stream of customers the entire time, which is a good sign. The cutie behind the counter mentioned they have coupons on the back of the receipt next door at Smith's. So, Smith shoppers, check those receipts and swing on in for some pretty fine Mexican chow on the cheap. Thanks to the ethnic composition of this area, there are several really good choices when you're ready to get your Mexican on, Tacos Los Toritos is right up there. We really didn't walk in thinking we would like it as much as we did, pressing the Like button!"}
{"text":"This location is just as good as the other 3. Tacos de Burris is my favorite item though..all their tacos are good, their burritos, their Tortas are great, the Menudo is to die for. An acquired taste if youve never had it. But if it's cooked right, it's the bomb. And theirs is the bomb. Their tripe is cleaned right and cooked right where it melts in your mouth. Their aquas, or fresh fruit waters are made in house. Recommend this one highly."}
{"text":"Love this one first of their 4 locations, this one is excellent. Food, fast service everything. Tried their tacos de Birria, very very delicious. Their Menudo is on point. One of the best in Las Vegas. Not all are good, you have to rate this dish by the way they clean the tripe and that it's cooked untill it practically melts in your mouth, and not chewy. Their aguas, or natural fruit waters are made in house. All their tacos are very good though. Their tortas, or sandwiches are good too and their burritos too. Their beans are very good too. I recommend this chain for  Cleanliness, authenticity and like just a few Taquerias, they serve just about every meat Mexicans use in their tacos. This location was the first I tried and was sold on their product. Very good."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Order made fresh.  Beans hot and tasty.  Chicken taco moist with a kick.  Guacamole lettuce and tomato perfectly balanced the kick. The way authentic mexican food should be.  Steak Quesadilla well meaty and cheesy.  When in Vegas again its my new home town place to eat."}
{"text":"I was looking for some decent authentic Mexican off the strip while in Vegas on business. This place had good reviews on YELP so I gave it a try.  I had the chorizo tacos and a carne asada taco with a side of beans. The chorizo tacos were fantastic, fresh and nice spice. The carne asada were good as well, but the chorizo were my favorite. The beans were very tasty as were the fresh chips. I would highly recommend this spot and the staff were very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is a small hole in the wall type of place. It was clean and well kept. The prices are decent. I had the torta with everything on it and it was pretty good! Nice size, and will definitely fill you up. Plus I liked the way they made it- not sloppy at all. The guacamole was so tasty too. I had to try the horchata, but I was disappointed as it wasn't very sweet and they didn't mixed it very well, Roberto's horchata is way better. Overall, this is a good place for a quick bite :)"}
{"text":"This place isn't really a big deal other than their aguas frescas they're amazing! That's what saved them from one star the food is typical not much flavor I got some quesadillas de maiz but they weren't fully cooked :( they did fix my order but I was kinda in a rush. My dad got a menudo he enjoyed it they do charge for extra tortillas which is understandable."}
{"text":"Decent, cheap food. Like the street-style tacos.  I've found the burritos are actually better the next day after being in the fridge all night (I think it just gives them time to come together).  Are there better Mexican places in this town? Yup, but this place is an inexpensive, reliable place to grab some food, especially later in the evening after a few drinks."}
{"text":"After wanting mexican food, and wanting to try something new. I stumbled upon this place. How you know its going to be good? Well having to point at the menu or ordering by number because you dont speak spanish. I had the Combo #1. A Burrito with meat of your choice. A Taco. Chips Beans and Rice. About the burrito i got with Carne Asada. It was perfectly seasoned and bundled tight. It looks smaller than some burritos at other places but they pack it with more meat and less on the beans and rice. So its feeling as hell. And the green salsa isnt bland IT HAS A KICK TO IT. The kind of kick that opens up your sinuses. So i will try the red at some point and i can handle spicy. On to the Taco. It was packed with carne asada to. And was moist and delicious. They use fresh vegetables.   The chips were perfectly fried. The beans had bits of onions in them, and the cheese was gooey and melted on top. The rice was moist and fluffy not dry and dense with some meals at other places. I wanted a Al pastor taco but they were out. Hence the 4 stars but it was 11pm when i went in. And the tacos are only 1.35 thats a deal with how big they are too."}
{"text":"I have been to Las Vegas about 20 times for work, and I have to say that I had the best burrito of my life (and I have been to Mexico--twice) at this local place. It is on the top of my list for my next visit. I live in Manhattan, and have had burritos everywhere possible, including the Mission district in San Francisco--this burritos are AMAZING."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a \"home cooked meal\" taste this is the place you must come try! Best Mexican place around. I think I've tried about everything on the menu from tacos to chiles rellenos and there hasn't been a time where I didn't like the food. The salsas are bomb as well as the aguas frescas always fresh ! Place is always clean and staff is very friendly. You're missing out !!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to see why people like this place. Really? I got my order in Spanish and the TV had some obnoxious soap opera en Espanol so I had really high hopes for this place. Then I opened my box and was like WTF? You know it's not a good sign when you feel the grease in your mouth before you even touch your food.   I ordered a chicken quesadilla and a taco with rice and beans. The quesadilla felt like it was prepared by a 10 year old white girl who decided to use her mother's left over grease from a week ago to experiament with cooking for the first time. The taco was whatever. My Bulgarian mother has made more authentic tacos than that. The beans were good, but if they fucked those up I'd be worried. They have them premade in cans. Sure, the portions were large, but what happened to quality over quantity? I blame my negative reviews due to my travels. If I had never traveled to Mexico or didn't seek out Mexican food frequently, I probably would have loved this place.  Oh also, customer service....forget it. Nobody smiles here. They're probably pissed they have to eat their own food on their lunch break though so that's why I give this place two stars."}
{"text":"I was there for my lunch hour one day. I like that they had a \"buffet-style\" condiment cart... And that's about it. The Carne Asada tacos were so dry I began to choke on the first bite! After I literally drowned my tacos in salsa, due to how dry they were, I dumped the last taco and left. I finished off the rest of my lunch with a double cheeseburger from across the street at the McDonalds :/"}
{"text":"My wife and I are Mexican food lovers.  We came here by chance driving around Las Vegas and decided to stop.  Prices are affordable, place was busy and staff was nice.  Pineapple drink tastes like I just not directly into a yummy ripe pineapple!  Sauce is good, carne asada tacos are yummy..I got the Machaca plate and we are pleasantly surprised.  I recommend coming here for sure!"}
{"text":"I have a very bossy friend who refuses to eat at chain establishments.  She insisted I meet her there.  While she didn't remember the name, we went inside and the cashier and her clearly had a friendly relationship because my friend followed up on her Thanksgiving plans.   My friend ordered for me a chicken burrito.  I also had this crazy drink that was in large iced glass jars up front labeled by fruit names.  I got the orange, which was pretty tasty.  The burrito came with a bit of chips on the side.  I should have really just eaten half and saved the rest for later.  Instead, it was so good and we were chatting that I got 3/4 of the way through the burrito before I realized that I was too full to take another bit.  Besides chicken, the burrito had sauteed veggies, rice, and beans.  I would return and order for myself, but when someone offers to buy you lunch, you say yes.  The total bill was around $15 for two burritos and two drinks."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos are the bombbbbbbb here!!!!!  Best tacos around. Everything here is actually really good. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Great little hideaway place. Food taste great, great service. I gave this place 3 stars only because my soup had very little broth & was warm, but not hot. My hubby had the Carne Asada Tacos. The tacos $1.89ea. I'm used to paying a little less for the same type of Tacos but nevertheless they were good."}
{"text":"Just tested them out yesterday. No problems, I wish their menu was more accessible; but the food is what you would expect. The staff is friendly, speedy prep & drinks are excellent!"}
{"text":"great cheap mexican grub!  a rainbow of different colored, freshly made aguas frescas!    this is the best local taqueria i've been to in vegas.  you know you've hit upon a good taco spot when you're the only white chick in the joint and the 2 mexican guys in front of you in line are wearing cowboy hats and singing along with the awful mexican music on the jukebox.  telemundo all day long!  i love it!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at ! They have a wide selection of aguas frescas and the food and meat is delicious and well made . Hard to find a good Mexican restaurant in town, always my go-to."}
{"text":"Very good food and nice people. I had the turkey tail tacos and fish tacos, they where very good. We also had the flautas and a quesadilla, very good."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food.  Great salsa bar.  Burrito combo plate for $7.50.  Close to NELLIS AFB.  They sell old fashion coke bottles.  Their Horchata is awesome!"}
