{"text":"What a gem of a place!  It was summertime when I visited this place and they had the window wall up.  It wasn't crowded at all so we were able to get a spot close to the windows.   I love how they serve brown rice sushi here, and it's really tasty.  As everyone recommends, rock shrimp is the best!  The price was not bad for its location, although even though it wasn't very busy, service was a tad slow.   I would definitely come back for more AYCE, and this time I will bring my apetite :)"}
{"text":"Despite having many years of restaurant eating experience, this is my first review on Yelp.  My first visit to Sushi D more than four years ago was very good so I've been eating at here since 2006 on a regular basis even though it's not in my immediate neighbourhood.  I've been going to sushi restaurants for more than 10 years and I still come back here for celebrations with friends and family (all who are big experienced sushi eaters) so I can say it's my favourite and everyone pretty much leaves with a positive experience.  The Google search seems to have the address wrong and the street view is outdated (address shows 705 College but actually it's 671 College St.).  The owner knows me by face and name though I don't know hers.  Most Japanese restaurants in the GTA area are owned by Chinese or Korean and this one is Chinese.  Japanese owned restaurants are usually pricier, rarely AYCE, the quality and service is often more refined but not always better (depending on your expectations).  I'm usually  the designated person to do the ordering since I'm quite familiar with the menu so we don't waste time trying to figure out what we want (we often do 3-4 rounds as a group).  My first suggestion is go as a group of 4 or more when eating sushi if you want to try different things in AYCE places.  The service here has always been decent and they are pleasant though they do occasionally miss a dish or two when it's busy.  No big deal, order it again on the next round.  The price is reasonable and they do charge extra $2 on weekends.  Reservations are recommended if you have a group as the restaurant is not big.   The menu and sushi selection is great.  The rock shrimp here is probably the most unique item on their menu and a big hit for most of us.  It has mayo and garlic so you need to like that too before ordering it.  Fresh seaweed salad, mushroom miso soup, fried scallop, spider rolls, enoki maki (mushroom beef), california hand roll (big), tempura squid and shrimp (lightly battered so not as heavy), salmon sashimi (excellent quality) and kani sashimi (crab stick) are our menu favourites.  Don't forget to leave room for ice cream... vanilla with chocolate kahlua sauce and tempura bits is my fav but others like the green tea.  Overall, a 4.5 star rating based on value for this type of eatery and I'll post some others when I have time... enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Went to this place before and it was pretty good to decided to give it another try.. wrong idea.   We went for the AYCE dinner, ordered a few apps, they were okay but nothing special. I would agree the rock shrimp was probably the best of anything we had.   The service was terrible, no time taken to lay dishes down, they were basically just tossed on the table.   After waiting about 20 minutes we realized that they waitress probably forgot our order.. which she did (and they were doing nothing the entire time but talking to eachother). After a weak apology, when the sushi finally came it was almost inedible. the amount of rice was so enormous that it could barely fit in your mouth, and when it did it is all you can taste.  Ive eaten alot of sushi. This is hands down the worst i've tried.  The sashimi was not bad i guess but we were so frustrated at this point that we just asked for the bill in the middle of an AYCE.   When I asked to speak to the manager, it seemed that she could barely speak enough english to understand what I was telling her.    Disappointing  Will not return"}
{"text":"Rock shrimp was great, lots of choices so little room. Pretty quick service as well. Would go again"}
{"text":"D-Sushi was a good place ( probably the Best in Toronto )... not any more ! Pity ! I start eating sushi from Russia before 1970 .., then : Germany, Denmark, Ireland .. That how I found Yuki Sushi at 3295 Dufferin St ."}
{"text":"This is my first review and I hardy write a review for the restaurant/shop I visited even if I had either a  wonderful or terrible experience there. But this time, let me tell you what I felt about this restaurant.  The taste was OK and actually my partner was really satisfied with the meal. However, to me, their service was kinda unacceptable!!  When we came in, almost all staff seemed to be having lunch at far inside the table, therefore, no one did not see us coming in. That's fine 'cause I understand everyone needs break for a meal. Then, a waitress took us to a table and gave menus without any word or smile. I felt like we were not really welcomed by them since we are exactly Asian looking, as other reviewer said something about it.   Alright, I am easy-going, so never-mind. But,   this is so bad..... When the waitress served our dishes, she turned over my partner's dish(small salad bowl) on his pant, but she even did not say, sorry!! It was a salad, not soup, so he just got stains on his pant,  which would be easily gone by washing, but no apology? Hello??  I probably won't come back here again."}
{"text":"I am a simple woman, with simple needs...like, I expect sushi at SUSHI D.   Let me preface this by saying this is not my first time here. My friends and I went to UofT and have been on many occasions for some moderately-priced AYCE sushi. It's supposed to be reliable in quality.   I'll start from the very beginning. We should've clued in that shit was not going well when we first sat down and the waitress told us there were not enough glasses for us to have water. She accommodated by giving us water bottles. Cool! Great service! Oh how wrong we were.   We start to order various rolls, apps, sushi and sashimi. We were 6 people, but it wasn't too much food as we planned on ordering more afterwards. After ordering, we wait about 15 mins and get some rock shrimp. While eating this plate of rock shrimp, the waitress comes to us and says \"We do not have sushi, is that okay?\" Confused, we asked her to repeat herself several times. She seemed frustrated as we asked repeatedly...but can you fucking blame us for being confused when they tell us they don't have SUSHI AT A SUSHI RESTAURANT??? We clarified with her that they have rolls and sashimi. But just not sushi. Uh, okay. I guess we were okay with it. Huge mistake.   For some weird reason, the only thing they would serve us in a timely manner is spider rolls and salmon sashimi. We ordered like 3-4 other rolls but they didn't come for an hour so we ordered it again. Did not come. At one point, I had to ask the waitress out of curiosity if spider rolls were the only thing they had. She said yes, as a joke, but I did not know she was joking due to everything that had happened. They then brought a dragon roll which had a shit ton of cucumber and almost no unagi even though the waitress claimed cooking the unagi was what was taking 1.5 fucking hours.   I suspect Sushi D is a farm-to-table establishment. In that, they must raise the eels and tuna in the back and slaughter them to order. I don't have any other ideas as to why it'd take so long to get an unagi roll that actually had 90% cucumber only anyway.   After 2.5 hours, 6 spider rolls and about 80 pieces of anorexic salmon sashimi, we gave up. We didn't get 50% of the things we ordered. We suspect the sushi chefs did not know how to make the rolls. And we just wanted to call it a night.   The guys in our group left hungry and we vow to never return until maybe they have sushi...and food other than spider rolls."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the relatively poor reviews Sushi D has received. I'm not usually a fan of AYCE but here that's the best option so that you can experience the variety of Sushi D. Okay - some of their creations are not great (e.g. treasure island). but the Rock Shrimp are outstanding, as is the spicy tuna. The restaurant is attractive and service is friendly. This is my goto Sushi Restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to AYCE sushi places in the city. As everyone has already said, the rock shrimp are incredible. Just tried them about a week ago for the first time and have been dreaming of them ever since. I also love the Spicy Tuna Roll. The cilantro and jalapeno give it a really cool, fresh taste. Also, a decent price considering the size and quality of the menu. Service can be less than great, and you can be left waiting to order more for a very long time. But overall, pretty great place."}
{"text":"This was my first time at an AYCE in downtown Toronto (I usually eat in Sauga and have been to a couple places in Hamilton) and I chose Sushi D from comparing different reviews on different websites and it consistently came out on top :) And the reviews were all accurate! The service was the best I've ever had at any AYCE, the food was amazing, and the restaurant itself was really nice inside with interesting & funky (but fun) music. Despite being harassed by a homeless man knocking at the window and then coming INSIDE the restaurant asking us for money, our table by the window was nice and romantic :)  Since it was my first time here, I ordered mainly based on recommendations online: rock shrimp (amazing), tuna tataki, gyoza (average), summer roll, caterpillar roll, signature D roll, and a few pieces of salmon and tuna sushi, and salmon sashimi. I was really impressed that the rolls & sushi were not packed with rice, like they are at most other AYCEs, meaning I didn't have to do any dissecting. We also ordered sushi pizza....and it was horrible-probably the worst sushi pizza I've ever had, but that is my only complaint :)"}
{"text":"I've given sushi D many chances ( I was in denial that they're standards had gone down, it was in times - not too long ago, a great place).  I should've seen the red flag and left when I saw their former table server making the sushi.  I will never come here again. They even managed to mess up the best thing they have on the menu : rock shrimp. Truly a saddening disappointment. From the waitress who looks like she hates her job and never smiles, to the quality of te food that had depreciated, I just don't know how they're still in business. I'd rather go to Akita sushi, where the food is fresher an tastes better.  Farewell Sushi D, wish I could say it's been a slice, but..."}
{"text":"Most people go here for the rock shrimp, which I completely support. However, I feel the portions have gotten smaller over the past few visits..with most of their items. I don't know much about authentic sushi but I know what tastes good and this place has yet to disappoint as far as flavour and variety goes."}
{"text":"I liked Sushi D, but I didn't fall in love.  The sushi and maki rolls were disappointing.  The rice was sticky and they put way too much for my taste.  Your probably better off, ordering sashimi with a side order of rice so you can achieve the best rice to fish ratio.  Oh, and they put cream cheese in some sushi rolls which grosses me out.  I recommend trying some other non-sushi items from the menu.   The Spicy Tuna Tataki is awesome (its seasonal, but they say you are limited to one order per table.)  Try the rock shrimp, beef teriyaki, tempura shrimp, and the Korean Bbq ribs.  They were out of Soft Shell Crab, Fried Oyster, and some other stuff when I went.  So that took away from the experience.  The quality is just ok, its what you expect from an all-you can eat place.  I've eaten at better all you can eat places though."}
{"text":"Food guaranteed to make you sick. Their Sashimi tasted rancid like garbage and the service was horrible. Don't go here if you have any dignity at all. I grabbed a couple of friends and we decided to venture out of our Annex Sushi eats and try something different. We wound up at Sushi D. This was the worst dining experience I've had in Toronto. The rolls (we had the caterpillar and spicy tuna though they gave us salmon) were chocked full of filler and light on taste. The worst was the Sashimi we ordered, the plate was filled with rancid, garbage-smelling fish bits that were discoloured and slimy. It is unfathomable that this would be served in a first world country. We ate none of it. They asked if everything was alright. We said it tasted like garbage. They didn't take it off the bill. Which was fine. Instead, they let it sit in front of us like steaming hot garbage, the smell wafting over the entire restaurant, while they removed all of our plates and soy sauce. The waitress assured us it was 'fresh'. The thought of it makes me ill. Further, they 'accidentally' brought us a role and said it was on the house and then charged us for it. The bill took 20 minutes to arrive at the table and had to be asked for multiple times. This is Toronto's worst restaurant. Don't go here. Go to Next Generation or Sushi on Bloor. This place will just waste your money, your time and make you sick."}
{"text":"Pros: -Tuna Tataki is amazing, not sure if it's limited to 1 per table though. -Rock shrimp is also amazing, it's lightly battered fried shrimp with a sweet and salty garlic sauce -Other cooked dishes were also properly done, although the tempura were a bit too greasy and left me feeling a bit queasy afterwards -Sashimi is fresh and they have Tuna sashimi for dinner -Attentive staff, great service  Cons: -This is the deal breaker for me: the rice they used for sushi was barely seasoned, it was bland and ruined the taste of every maki we tried. The ingredients they used for the sushi were great, all fresh fish and properly prepared eel/shrimp etc but without properly prepared and seasoned rice, it just tastes like seaweed, fish & soy sauce. -Stay away from the Philadelphia roll. They make it by using a huge chunk of regular salmon + a thin sliver of smoked salmon + a chunk of cream cheese. The sliver of smoked salmon was literally half a CM wide. Anyone who has had proper Philly roll knows that there shouldn't be anything other than smoked salmon + cream cheese, they were obviously trying to cut corners since smoked salmon costs more than fresh.  Overall, a pretty disappointing experience considering all the positive reviews here. I've tried over 10 AYCE sushi places in Toronto and this ranks in the bottom 3. It really is a shame because if only they would take the time to prepare the sushi rice properly, then I'm sure this would be the best AYCE I've ever had since almost everything else was there.   Personally, I think I know why the rice is so bland, not only does it save time and sushi vinegar, but when we dined there, I noticed that we were the only Asian customers in the restaurant. Everyone else was Caucasian. I'm not being racist here, but maybe Caucasians prefer sushi rice to be more bland? I also noticed that all the maki were rolled inside out (rice on the outside, seaweed inside) which was invented because Caucasians didn't like the look of seaweed on the outside. Most other sushi restaurants don't bother doing this because it takes more time to prepare the rolls, so I think Sushi D does this intentionally to cater to the Caucasian clientele which is perfectly fine because they seem to be doing quite well. Just not recommended for Asian taste buds maybe :)  Bottom line: Go here if you like cooked japanese food + fresh sashimi, stay away if you like sushi or maki or anything that contains sushi rice."}
{"text":"Sushi D has never let me down.  The waiters always seem to know exactly what goes into everything, so if you don't know, ask.  Challenge yourself to try some of the more complex creations, they are always surprising.  Any roll is available w/ white or brown rice (no extra charge) but of course brown rice will fill you up quicker (not ideal!).  Go on a weeknight; they'll charge $2 extra on weekends and I'd say it's already on the pricier side for AYCE.  My Must-Orders: - rock shrimp (garlicky goodness) - treasure island (a mountain of chopped mixed fish mixed in spicy sauce) - volcano (spicy salmon w/ a hit of sriracha on top) - spicy white tuna (an actual slice of jalapeno on top) - green tea ice cream for dessert"}
{"text":"I read a bunch of bad reviews but decided to give it a shot anyways.   I'm not really sure weather there are new owners or what, because my sushi was delicious and quick, and every time I walk by here it is PACKED; like, you couldn't find a seat if you tried.   I think $20 for all you can eat is a bit expensive, but I guess that's just Toronto."}
{"text":"I went to Sushi D for my birthday this past weekend and noticed they cleaned the light switch that I mentioned in my previous review so the operators of Sushi D must be keeping an eye out on the reviews on Yelp. Table was also cleaner (no more bad smell) but still a little grimy. Sishi D tip: use a little bit of white vinegar and water at the end of the day to clean your tables. It will cut the grime and grease off the table and neutralize odours. The vinegar smell will be gone by morning.  Anyways, service was better than usual. Waitress was a little more attentive but still not that great in terms of service. The man who brought out some of our orders and cleared some dishes was a little more talkative and polite. An improvement... but still needs some work.   Food quality was still consistently good and tasty. Portions were generous for things like the rock shrimp and orders came out fast. Well done.  Sushi D has improved a bit since my last review. I hope they continue improving their service and maintain their food quality."}
{"text":"This is a good place. Four of us went last night and were seated after a 5 min wait.  The $20 AYCE sushi is well worth the price.  We ended up getting a lot of food.  Some of the dishes that stood out was the treasure island, 'd' roll, volcano, enoki maki, rock shrimp.  There were other more normal fare sushi/sashimi.  The food was good and fresh, obviously one of the more important factors.  Even though my manager picked up the bill, I thought the beer was pricey.  As everyone mentioned, the variety is fantastic, and I always enjoy finishing off with some green tea ice cream.  This is a place I'd go back to if I were in the mood for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time when i lived in Toronto. I figured i'd write something about it because i'm a bit home sick.  I have to say out of most of the AYCE places in Toronto this one is always the same. The fish is pretty fresh and the have a pretty big menu. You have to make sure everyone gets the full AYCE menu otherwise you all get charged for full menu. They are pretty strict on this rule.   The tuna is nice and fresh. My favorit is the deep fried softshell crab which is on and off the menu. Its always on the menu but sometimes you can't get that AYCE.   Great place, bit small."}
{"text":"Great food, especially for $19.99 all you can eat. Unfortunately, the service is \"lacking\". Will definitely go back Love the Ice Cream"}
{"text":"The sushi was super fresh and the service was great!  This is definitely my top five sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect here but I walked into a really nicely decorated restaurant and exactly 2 min after we ordered, the food started coming out :) The treasure island was delicious albeit small so we ordered more :) The rolls are quite creative, the rock shrimp is good, actually many of the cooked items were all really good.  I wasn't that impressed with the sashimi...but all the other items were really good.  For $22 on Friday night, it was a great deal with a lot of selection, fast service and tasty food. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The bf and I did some research and Sushi D kept popping up as a great AYCE sushi. So we gave it a try. My first impression was that it had a nice patio,and it was very busy, so it must be good! Wrong.  Things started well, we were seated within seconds of arriving and handed our menus. The AYCE menu is huge and had lots of variety, so I was impressed thus far. We ordered, the rock shrimp, chicken and beef gyoza, and sushi pizza as starters. We also got an assortment of rolls, including Dynamite,spicy salmon, green dragon, rainbow, and the salmon and cream cheese roll. We also got some sashimi. I was excited!   I love sushi pizza....LOVE,LOVE,LOVE. This was awful. The salmon on top was mush. My bf pointed out that it looked like all the scraps were gathered and placed on top. It had no flavour, no tobiko (horror!). Just plain terrible, No yummy mayo sauce.  We were waiting for about ten mins, when we saw the waitress come out with a tray full of rolls. We thought \"great! there's our food!\" But then she placed it on the table next to us, where a confused looking couple said \"we didn't oreder this\" She then gave it to us. It looked like what we ordered, so we dug in.... Ummm I thought spicy salmon rolls were suppossed to be spicy. I flagged the waitress and asked her if in fact this was a spicy salmon roll. She looked at me like I was stupid and said \" Uh ya!\" It wasn't spicy. It had no flavour at all. And again the salmon looked like mush and left over scraps.  The rest of the meal went pretty much the same. All the rolls were mediocre at best. AND...the gyoza never made it to our table. When were done eating we asked the waitress about our gyoza and she  said she'd go see what happened. She returned 15min later and told us it was given to another table. Seriously?! So we placed another order. It took another 20min for that to make its way to our table. The gyoza were ok. Not worth the hassle. And a very flustered man came to our table to bring the gyoza out and apologize. He went to refill my glass and poured water all over my phone. Nice.  On a positive note the sashimi was good and fresh and the rock shrimp was yummy.  So that's what gets them these 2 stars. Im still on my search for a decent AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"Des sushi à volonté pour un prix fixe, c'est parfait ! Très bon service, excellente qualité des plats, grande diversité au menu et une décoration sobre en sus d'une belle terrasse."}
{"text":"We decided to visit Sushi D as a late bday dinner with a few friends.  Several people I know always compliment their food and had good things to say so we decided to give it a shot.  Great price for AYCE on a Friday/Saturday night, 21.99 per adult.  2 words Rock Shrimp - I could eat this for the rest of my life, there are no words to describe  how incredibly amazing it is!  We hadn't ordered it but the waitress suggested it.  I did however see it on 4 other tables and was going to ask what it was.  The way the maki was cut the pieces were sort of large, but still really good.  They also had a really good selection of rolls on their AYCE menu, even some of the fancier ones on the menu which isn't always common.  Sashimi was fresh and really good.  We had great, prompt, friendly service from more than one server.  We will be back for sure, and will drag more friends along!"}
{"text":"Was a customer from their Markham location. Food there was superb as was the service.  Somehow these attributes did not travel to their College St. location.  Have not been there for several years but the current reviews remind me of why I would not ever give them my business again.  Noticed that service is still surly and indifferent towards customers.  What turned me off was the fact that one of our party wanted  the lower priced sushi buffet offering because he is vegetarian while the other three of us wanted the higher priced buffet.  We were accused of trying to cheat them by possibly sneaking the higher priced sushi to our friend.  I spoke to the manager who  agreed to serve us as we requested but there was NO apology or improvement in the servers' attitude.  With such a condescending staff how they remain in business is beyond me.  It appears that the requirements to work there remain the same.... Rudeness an absolute asset.  Good luck future diners, get ready to be ignored and abused for your patronage."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years now. I don't know that many AYCE sushi places but I like this place because of their own recipes. Sure it's not real Japanese stuff, but for AYCE you have access to various items on the menu including all their rolls, sushi, sashimi, appetizers, dessert etc. I like it because there are various tastes and styles. Each of their rolls have a visual name (like the ones with bug names), so it's fun to try out. What I don't like too much is that when I get my rolls I'm never sure if it was exactly what I expected (by the way it looks or tastes, because they MAY get their orders confused), but for the price and the choice it's definitely solid. The Rock Shrimp is another one of my favorites. Very addictive, people. The restaurant has their own special little recipes and that's why I like this place. Don't expect Japanese dishes, but expect to be as full as you want."}
{"text":"Sushi D? More like, Sushi A+!!  High-fives all around for that one.  I used to doff my cap to Aji Sai on Queen West as the best AYCE sushi place in the west end, but I have to change my tune.  First, some prosaic issues - this is a wonderful place with a nice patio and great service. Not unlike Aji Sai, it's a darker, not atypical Japanese decor, but rather than Top 40, they played classic rock throughout our dinner. But here's the kicker, at the same price (if not two bucks cheaper) you can walk right in at anytime and find a great table without any wait. Take THAT Aji 'Wait Forever' Sai. So right off the bat, I'm in a better mood.  What can I really say about the food. I'm a squat white guy, so I just like to cram my face as fast and as messily as possible. I'll leave the proper critiques to more advanced sushi-ites. However, all of our food was amazing. Great dumplings for apps - we ordered three more servings. Great sashimi. The salmon was an absolute treat, as was the white tuna. But the real toast of the night was the spicy salmon role which blew my mind to the extent that my GF had to tell me to stop talking about it on the walk home. I was so enamored I totally forgot to pick up dry cleaning. The two of us ate a great meal, and by avoiding drinks (we had a glass of wine at home before walking over) the tab came to less than $50 for an hour of wonderful eating.  All in all this is an absolutely great place and now stands tall as my favorite sushi spot in the city."}
{"text":"What a great AYCE sushi join in little Italy.   The restaurant itself is very nice. Exposed brick and a nice patio - you don't see that in sushi joints.   The fish was so fresh and yummy. The salmon and white tuna sashimi and sushi was like butter and the dynamite rolls were fantastic.   Try the mushroom miso soup for a little earthy twist to your standard miso soup.  #sushid #yummy"}
{"text":"The service was OK and I thought the food was good until a few hours later I started to feel sick.  If you are running a restaurant  than it is your responsibility  to make sure everything is up to standards and high quality so your customers won't get food poisoning. If I could rate this place 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"I still love Sushi D.  I still obsess about the Rock Shrimp.  But I'm doing my due diligence to advise my fellow Yelpers that...  (a) The seaweed salad went from regular seaweed to an electric green chewier variety.  End Result?  Tastes the same, sort of.  Odd to look at.  (b) Treasure Island no longer comes with avocado.  The salmon and tuna was served on four strings of daikon and the portion is smaller  End Result? You will need to order more to satisfy your craving.  You will need to forget about the avocado.  This update is based on my last two visits in the last two months.  It's okay to cut corners if you need to.  I'm not sure why Sushi D needs to.  It's always busy?!?"}
{"text":"I must say this used to be my favourite AYCE for the past two years but after not visiting in a few months until last night I was MAJORLY disappointed. I used to crave this place...sad to say it's gone way downhill.  As other reviews suggested, service was awful- rude, slow, they plopped dishes on the table and hurried away, brought the wrong item twice, ignored our quantity requests and halved it (ie: my partner,a hungry man, asked for 25 pieces of tuna and white fish sashimi and was first served 10 pieces of salmon THEN when we told them again what we wanted they took it back and gave us 7 each of what we ordered???!! Math skills or money saving technique- disappointing). The sushi was mashed up and there were a lot of rolls that had 'filler' of tempura bits.  Poor quality. Bad service. Not going back. For $22 per person, not worth it.  Save yourself the money and time, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"May I start off by saying you serve the thing I would choose as a last meal or something to eat for the rest of my life is  the Pepper Tuna Tataki. Holy smokes you guys it's seriously OUT OF CONTROL.  I am really happy I live walking distance to my fave AYCE sushi place. I've been going to this spot for 4 years or so. I love pretty much everything on the menu. Their rock shrimp is amazing and make sure you save room for the french vanilla banana tempura ice cream. You can also ask for extra banana tempura bits in the ice cream too. That is clutch."}
{"text":"Spicy seafood soup, eel pancake, black sesame ice cream... Sushi D's menu is a little more adventurous than the other College Street sushi joints. Don't fret! The usual array of California rolls and tempura appetizers is available, too.  I used to be a die-hard for Sushi Island but I'm re-thinking my allegiances."}
{"text":"Sushi D is automatically on my good list because they have \"fancy schmancy\" rolls on their all-you-can-eat menu. Usually all-you-can-eat Japanese is filled with the fairly boring typically standard Japanese food items. At Sushi D, pretty much everything on their ala carte menu is available for all-you-can-eat. SCORE!   You must try the spicy scallop roll especially on a hot humid day. It somehow has a refreshing cool taste. You're probably thinking I'm speaking crazy, but you'll know exactly what I mean when you have this roll.   We also tried an \"interesting\" roll -  it consisted of mango, cream cheese, cucumber and salmon. And this invention would have be great, if the cream cheese chunk was smaller in proportion.  One of the other items I thoroughly enjoyed, but don't think my friends shared the same sentiment was the rock shrimp. It was deep fried to a perfect crispy and tossed in some kind of garlic sauce. Deep fried and garlic are also known as my lovers. Hence why, I devoured the cute shrimp without taking a breath of air.  The staff was friendly and helpful - they made suggestions when we were in a stump. The decor is cute, but classy. The restaurant is intimate. And the food is creatively tasty.  Sushi D is definitely a joint I'll be checking out again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I chose this resaurant from a blog posting on Toronto.com ( http://m.toronto.com/articles/best-all-you-can-eat-sushi-in-toronto/ ) we've been to quite a few AYCE restaurants over the last year, and I can honestly say that the woman who wrote that should stop reviewing sushi ASAP.                           First thing we noticed was the 1.5hr time limit and any uneaten food will be charged full price for, which is typical.  We sat down and were not offered any water or tea, which every other restaurant we've been to has had. We both ordered a pop which came in the form of an unopened can with a straw tucked under the tab ($2 each-we found out later) we still found it rather odd they did not offer water, it was even +30c out with the patio window wide open.  We ordered a Philadelphia/spicy salmon/green dragon roll to start, the rolls had so much rice we could barely fit them in our mouths. The fish/rice ratio was so off that we figured this was their way of filling you up so you order less. We also ordered the Rock Shrimp which we had heard was good, and it was..(woo)        When we wanted to place our next order neither of the two disinterested waitresses were around, one in the kitchen and one sitting at the back on the phone. Our final order was Unagi/fire/volcano roll and fried scallops...as soon as this was set in front of us we were so put off by the huge amount of rice on the rolls we just wanted to leave. We asked for some water, and two glasses of lukewarm tap water were plopped down in front of us without a word, the only time they offered a refill was when we asked for the bill. Needless to say we did not add a tip.    - Poor service- disinterested waitresses  - Poor quality- found salmon fat in roll, rice ratio off  - Ridiculous drink price  - Price isn't worth it...no price is worth it.    I am literally writing this as my bf lays in bed with stomach pains. This place has completely turned us off of sushi for a while.   I recommend Sushi Kiku at hwy 7/leslie ."}
{"text":"Came here because of the many great reviews decided to make reservation before i went with my family.  It was not  that busy when we arrived. We ordered the rock shrimp and it was really good. The sushi was fresh. Service was okay..The manger was eyeing us the whole time which made my family and I  very uncomfortable maybe because we ordered a lot and stayed for an 1 hr, but no reason to eye us down like that and make us feel uncomfortable. Like a pervious reviewer said we were the only Asian customers there. Why the two star then? As we were getting ready to leave my sister heard the owner ask the waiter how much i tipped her and then she mad a disgusted face. I wont be going there again."}
{"text":"Sushi D... #1 sushi all-you-can eat place by far. their staff is fast, prices are great (if you come on weekdays).  A must to try menu:  - Treasure island 3 orders - Spicy salmon maki 24pc - eel maki 12pc - Teriyaki beef stuffed with Japanese mushrooms.  I guess this place is for people that don't understand Sushi Island on College (like me)  Great competitor for Sushi Island."}
{"text":"Terrible.  I would never go again - no excuses. The server put down napkins and chopsticks in one pile.  He didn't bring dishes for soy sauce which I had to fetch myself as he wasn't around.  For 2 people he gave one menu even though there was a pile of them by the cash.  He did give 2 all-you-can-eat menus and a drinks menu though.  I should have known that if they served all-you-can-eat, the quality would suffer for it... I ordered a dragon roll (unagi, cucumber, avocado).  There was almost no unagi and the little that was there was not fresh.  The dragon roll was mostly cucumber and rice.  I spoke to the fellow who makes the rolls showing him there was almost no unagi and he said \"that is standard\".  He told me he used \"three pieces\".  The pieces must have been about the size of postage stamps or smaller, and two of them were only bits of skin.   Not \"standard\" in any other Japanese restaurant I have ever eaten in. My friend had chicken teriyaki and was (after a long wait) brought a rectangular plate with strips of chicken in sauce on it.  Nothing else.  She asked if it came with anything else like rice.  The server enquired in the kitchen and eventually brought a bowl of rice.  Nothing else was included for $11. - not a vegetable, a green leaf, nothing. For an order of a dragon roll with almost no unagi, a small plate of chicken strips, bowl of rice and order of gyoza we were billed $27. When I objected to the lack of quality, and the lack of unagi the fellow shrugged and said \"this is how we do it - this is standard\".  Not even an apology.  Not even any concern... There are LOTS of Japanese restaurants in Toronto.  I recommend walking past this one or going across the street and trying something worth paying for.  What a waste of money!!!"}
{"text":"I never thought that on my list of Favourite Incarnations of Things Called \"Treasure Island\", anything could possibly bump the cinematic Muppet masterpiece from its #1 spot held since 1996.  But something did, and that thing (a dish of cubed raw fish doused in \"house sauces\") can be found at Sushi D.  Unfortunately, some other things cannot be found at Sushi D, namely efficient service and smiles of any size, shape or form. Though I tried my best to disarm her, our waitress came to take our order like she was going to the dentist. Another waiter returned our cheery thanks with stony silence on the way out.  I would dock points for weird portion sizes, but with AYCE I guess it doesn't really matter. However, sashimi is inexplicably sliced to the size of Pink Pearl erasers, so order double the number of pieces you want.  In summation: slow to take orders, unfriendly staff, decent food. But a few delicious stand-out dishes and a nice patio make it sufficiently worthwhile. The $22 weekend price is pushing it but I'd return on a Tuesday. Try the mango maki, fire dragon rolls (eel with jalapeno on top), seaweed salad and pepper tuna tataki."}
{"text":"Terrible Japanese food. They offer a AYCE menu as well, which should have been a red flag to get the hell out. The only reason we came here was because it was during the World Cup and all other places were full.   The only reason I'm giving two stars and not one is there is one guy server (perhaps the manager) who does go above and beyond. He was very friendly and helped us get a table during the busy period.   The other two ladies who were serving were terrible. Granted, it was busy, but that was no excuse for indifferent, sullen, service. Plates were dropped off at our table with no comment, and I had to get up to go get our own cutlery because they tried their best to ignore us.   The yakiudon was the worst yakiudon we've ever had. Very bland, it just tasted like a bunch of noodles with a bit of soy sauce added in.  The rolls fell apart easily, and instead of crisp seaweed it was very chewy. The rolls didn't taste like something you would want to pay money for...  Our mistake was to come here and actually eat the food."}
{"text":"Another AYCE sushi on College. I tried this on a late Friday night. I enjoyed the patio very much, as this is probably the only place where I can have my sushi outside, and it made me happy.  The service was the best I have ever had at an AYCE sushi. The selection is great and the sushi is fresh."}
{"text":"The night I went they were seriously short-staffed.  We spent much of the time desperately trying to get the attention of one of two servers. Once we finally did my request for cold sake was clearly forgotten.  My friends, regulars of the place, assured me this never happens here so I can kind of forgive it.  As an all-you-can-eat joint keep in mind your dinner's timed.  You've got an hour and half.  Good thing we wrapped up after two rounds of sashimi and rolls with still one minute to spare.    I liked the rolls we tried.  We asked for all with brown rice which was a bit of a treat to have as an option. They came out room-temp and crispy.  Loved the spice.  However, my fav thing to get is maguro (tuna) sashimi and that came out in bizarre chunks that looked like it had been cut while frozen and tasted like it wasn't super fresh.  The white fish sashimi my friend ordered didn't suffer from the same symptoms.  Overall the place is okay, decent music, interesting takes on the regular Japanese dishes.  I might try it again but steer clear of sashimi and stick to the rolls."}
{"text":"A group of us hit up sushi D for my birthday on a Wednesday night. We have had takeout from there before and loved the Rock Shrimp. On this trip we did all you can eat and it was really good! The orders came to the size relative to our group, the sushi chef prepared us a special avocado and salmon dish that was not on the menu and provided as a token of there appreciation.  Service was great!, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi? For $20 a person?  Say no more.  Little casual joint in Toronto's Little Italy.  Like other restaurants in this area, there's sizeable outdoor sidewalk seating that gives directly into an airy narrow indoor dining room.  Affable, fast service and at the ready with great suggestions.    You would think an all you can eat sushi place would skimp on variety, but Sushi D delivers with a great selection of specialty rolls, sashimi (as other reviews mention, the portion and cuts leave something to be desired) sushi, tempura, and a wide splendor of Japanese hot dishes.  Not surprisingly, they are heavy-handed with the rice - so keep that in mind when ordering regular sushi.    Be sure to order doubles of the japanese eggplant and the rock shrimp- the preparation is delish!  Wear loose pants and get ready to gorge. Just short of four stars..."}
{"text":"Best AYCES I have found. Fast service, good portions, good price, large selection. Will definitely be back. My favourites: Spider Roll, Mango Roll, and Rock Shrimp (I think that is what it was called--it's in the appetizers section)."}
{"text":"I'll keep it appropriately short, to honour the equivalent shortness the waitstaff graced us with:  Food good. Ate All I Could. Pepper Tuna and Treasure Island Highlights. Prices fine. Service was present."}
{"text":"This place was referred to me by someone who swore it to be the best in the city. I have my favourites which I prefer, but based on the high recommendation, my friend and I tried it. We got the garlic rock shrimp, tasty but nothing I couldn't make at home. spider roll, awful spicy salmon handroll, mushy, seaweed was soggy and nothing spicy about it tempura, stodgy fried noodle, vinegary sushi was fishy, which means not fresh. This is the first time I have ever walked out of a sushi place with food left on my plate and a lot of food at that. House wine my friend ordered was \"not good\" Best thing about the meal was sake and leaving  do not recommend at all"}
{"text":"I've tried many AYCE sushi restaurants, what makes me come back to Sushi D is the rock shrimp! It's lightly battered and tossed in a tangy sauce. Perfect crunch!  For $22, you can get AYCE sushi. There are many house maki rolls but I always go for the dragon rolls and lots of sashimi...  I do have to say that sometimes the service isn't as consistent as other times but I can understand if it's a busy day."}
{"text":"Okay I am not going to lie, this place gets ONE extra star for existing in a neighbourhood  where there is slim picking when it comes to sushi. Having said that, I HAVE returned to this spot multiple times to enjoy their food and rather quick service.  One beef I usually have with all-you-can-eat is that they clear away everything even if you're not done and they are skimpy on the service; not here.We were very well attended and by someone who is not only fluent in English but also friendly (a rare find these days, particularly in Asian restaurants I find).  Another wonderful thing; the proportions are NOT ridiculous....I may be alone in this but most places are generous in their serving - some places are so generous that they will charge you for left over food *Ahem Aji Sai\" - which I find bizarre. I mean just reduce your proportions! but I digress. So I really appreciate the serving size here; I'm here to enjoy variety of dishes as much as I can - not pig out (although that's inevitable in my case). The sashimi, which I measure every Japanese restaurant by - was actually VERY good; this is an added plus for me because I find that although many excel in making sushi, not all excel in sashimi which require freshest bits of meat.  Now that I've raved - here is my ONE beef and this is SO minor that I feel like I'm big a bag of tighty-whities...but, they serve  JASMINE SCENTED GINGER here. I AM not  a fan of ginger but after having some raw fish, I like to cleanse my palette and sense of smell  with some marinated ginger or radish if offered. But NOTHING cleanses like  ginger- unless the ginger is jasmine scented. Seriously, if I wanted to have strange sensation of having inhaled jasmine air freshener, I would have sprayed some Fabreeze in my mouth. TOTALLY RUINED. As I said, some people just don't care about that minor detail - it's the anal-asian-foodie in me that won't let me accept and let go of this flaw.  However I recommend it highly : their Rock shrimp is to DIE for...and unlike the chesse wonton you won't get sick of it after the 4th round."}
{"text":"After switching owners the new owners have finally perfected the rock shrimp!! Yes!  I will be back!! :) me thinks they need a little touch up in decor and a good steam clean on the upholstery, will def bring new life to this place."}
{"text":"Simple review. Food fantastic. Service terrible. Slow or order doesn't come at all. Ruined my b day plans w a table of hungry ppl and late for our after plans. They're busy bc theyre food is good so to the owners pls if you want to keep your clientele put more staff on! One waiter one cook is not enough!!!"}
{"text":"Quick service and the best AYCE menu in the city. The sushi/rolls and extensive appetizer/main/dessert menu always have me craving my Sushi D fix.   I've never had to wait for a table and the service is always quick.   MUST TRY: D Roll, Spider Roll and Rock Shrimp. The Rock Shrimp is literally addicting. Try and tell me otherwise.  AYCE: $22 (fri-sun) and $20 (mon-thurs) but it is SO worth it."}
{"text":"We've tried many all you can eat sushi joints in the city and this is by the far the best we've found. For about $25 you get sashimi, sushi, maki, noodles, rice, appys, dessert and whole lot inbetween.  Favourites include : rock shrimp, treasure island, D roll, tuna & salmon sashimi, spicy tuna roll, red dragon roll, sea weed salad, miso soup, shrimp tempura and for dessert the green tea ice cream fried with the Kahlua sauce!"}
{"text":"Okay food, too much rice, weird music.  Came here for AYCE sushi dinner in the spring. Food was not bad, rolls were well composed and tasty enough. The rock shrimp was probably the best part. Kinda crispy, kind chewy, covered in a garlicky sweet and sour sauce. Kinda weird but totally yummy. The sushi and the rolls had way too much rice, but I guess that's how it is for a lot of cheap AYCE places these days. The fish, however, was great and fresh. Very good. When we arrived, there was just one server attending to a bunch of different tables all over the place so service was slow until someone else showed up. The owner/chef was really nice and made sure everything was alright during our meal.   The weirdest part of the night was after about 15 or 20 minutes, my friend and I started to notice that they were playing the same song over and over again. It wasn't a bad song or anything, but so weird that it was playing on a loop. It was a very generic sort of mellow moody pop song. We tried to Shazam it multiple times with no success, even when it was quiet.   I don't think I would come back, but it would do in a pinch. I half hope they play that song again."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant off of Yelp and was excited to try it out as it was a AYCA sushi place. Upon arrival there was two servers and one person making the sushi. One server appeared to be new as she was delivering food to the wrong tables and being told by the main server to clear tables. The restaurant was in no way full and the staff had a hard time keeping up with the incoming orders.  When ordering, the server wrote down your order on a pad and did not offer anything for you to write your own orders down. We didn't receive several of the items we wanted and ordered. We knew this as we kept a note open on our phone.   The food was okay but the service was so slow. We waited about 10 minutes for each item to be delivered to our table. We also ordered veggie tempura and had to ask for it 4 times before they delivered it to us at the very end of our meal. The tempura was very low quality and a very small portion. It almost seemed like they didn't really care about the presentation.  The main server appeared very tired, not sociable and seemed to be angry when asking questions about the sushi.  I'm not a picky person but this had to be the worst sushi experience I've ever had. I go to Spring sushi from now on for AYCE due to the disappointing food, long wait times and not receiving the proper order.   Save your money."}
{"text":"Okay so normally were not big AYCE people. We prefer sushi outings that involve us selecting a few quality rolls and unfortunatelly resultign in us spending around 60-70.00 after all is said and done.  On this particular night... we were HANGRY and we wanted copious amounts of sushi and sashimi and noodles and appetizers and everything. So we googled and googled and came across this gem. The menu soudned expansive and full of variety. The reviews mentioned a few gems like Rock Shrimp and Treasure Island. Intruiged off we went in search.   First of all. The reviews do not lie. Service is atrocious. The servers have no interest in exchanging common politeness - like hello or thank you or your welcome or anything more than \"okay\". The tea was COLD. how can green tea be cold? Regardless, we ordered...  The rock shrimp was essentially battered shrimp covered in a honey sauce. Meh. The treasure island was a mess of sashimi heavily loaded with sauces. and more honey. the gyoza was a disgrace. slimy and barely filled. The 5 rolls were ordered were unimaginative and lacking in flavious. All of them also tasted like HONEY. What is up with all the honey?   The salmon sashimi was not fresh at all. so thats where we stopped ordering sashimi.  One of the items was FOUL. We ordered spicy white tuna roll and the fish actually tasted off. we left the entire roll and proceed to ask for the bill as we had a feelign we were going to get very sick.  My most favorite item... the green tea icecream. cause seriously...how can you mess that up? Ohh i forgot by giving me a plastic wet spoon. kinda gross.  Dinner on a sunday ngiht was 19.00 (they dropped the price from 21). Total after everythign was 50.00. We both ended up with horrible tummy aches all night and 50.00 poorer for no damn good reason.   Honestly... maybe were nto AYCE people... but this stuff was bad."}
{"text":"I was looking for a Sushi place downtown/West that was opened late and stumbled on this place. Open until 11:30pm on a Thursday and still serving their all-you can eat menu for $20, I was generally happy with what I got.  I gave this place 3 stars because although I agree with Maureen that the all-you-can eat menu is pretty varied as it offers the \"specialty rolls\" the quality was just ok. I had Sashimi which is a great was to test the quality of the sushi and I was rather disappointed with both the size and cut of my salmon.  Unless I was looking for an all-you can eat in that area or late night sushi... I would probably pass on this place and venture to Queen West or the Annex for some better sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi D is probably my number two when I consider the sushi joints along College. I'm still 100% loyal to Sushi Island, but lately I've been questioning whether or not I always want my maki to have grapes in them. The answer is obviously yes, but sometimes I long for different options.  Sushi D has the standard Japanese fare, but they do have so many options it doesn't make sense. Especially on their all-you-can-eat menu. That menu works with the same denominations as every other place -- around $14-15 for maki only, closer to $20 for the whole menu. $2 more on weekends and holidays. I had the whole menu AYCE once and we got great service and I ate until I had to unbutton my jeans.  The interior is gorgeous and staff are generally OK. They could take some tips from Sushi Island and give a few more tea and water refills, but besides that, this place is worth checking out if you're in Little Italy and craving some Japanese food."}
{"text":"Great quality, appetizers come fast, hot things take longer.  tasty: treasure island (fun little sphere of sashimi with tasty sauces) fried cheese wonton(light and crispy with delightfully soft cheese) rock shrimp (a light crunch within a sauce covered shrimp makes this dish stand out) shrimp tempura (always nice) tempura ice cream with khalua(i believe this is a fine matcha ice cream, and the tempura pieces and kahlua is a nice touch but not overpowering) spider maki(soft-shell crab...absolutely delicious) green dragon roll (pretty basic tempura shrimp & avocado, but nice large serving if you feel like you can eat more and am reaching the 1.5hr limit)"}
{"text":"As a longtime customer, I've finally had it with this place.   When we started going there, the food was wonderful, the service quick and thoughtful, the overall experience was great.  However, they seem to be more focused on making a quick buck than taking care of regular customers and looking at the long term.  Which is why we won't be back.  The last three times, we've noticed several issues that I can no longer accept. Regardless of pricepoint, certain things are just not acceptable.  1) Food quality  Everyone loves the Treasure Island, hands down. But in the last four orders, every single one I've had has become increasingly messy, slapdashed and FROZEN. I can't begin to tell you how unappetizing it is to have a meal that's frozen in the middle. It's sloppy, and I'm not entirely sure it's foodsafe to defrost something right before you serve it. In order to do that, they can't be doing it in accordance to Health standards.  Plus, the rice was overcooked and the sushi fell apart on contact with our chopsticks.   2) Portion  The portions these days are much smaller and inconsistent than they used to be. Yeah, I understand they are trying to increase profit, but if I order four pieces of sashimi, I expect them to be all the same, not four different sizes. And this is across the board - apps, maki, sashimi. Colour me unimpressed.   3) Ridiculously poor front of house management  This was really what set me off. We went earlier this week, we made sure to notify the manager of my allergies. I told her exactly what products I can't have, but she made no effort to let me know which plates had allergens in it. I couldn't eat half of the plates we ordered, which was frustrating. if I'd had a more serious allergy, I could have landed in hospital.   The second issue we had was woefully inconsistent service. We'd be ignored for 10 minutes, and then three servers would come by within 3 minutes to take our orders, when they had clearly been taken. It didn't seem to register when we told them that, either. There was no communication between the manager and the servers or bussers, let alone them and the kitchen.  But the biggest peeve I have was the fact they would purposefully forget our orders. We ordered 4 pieces of Inari and some sashimi, which never came. We asked the manager and two servers several times, but at no point did anyone go to the kitchen and ask about our order - they just went back to cleaning.  And it's not like the kitchen was busy - we could clearly see three of them standing around and talking. Again, this has happened before.   So in short, don't bother. I certainly won't ever again."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome. Not anymore. Awful slow service, messed up orders, and leaving without even getting half of what we ordered. Don't go there."}
{"text":"When my usual AYCE joints nearby had no available space, I came to SushiD, where there were several tables open.  The sushi was AWFUL, the rice was too sweet and chewy, and the rolls had very thick rice layers.  I couldn't finish them.  The teriyaki beef was very fatty.  Service was good.  Food was terrible."}
{"text":"Went last week for AYCE with my girlfriend who was a fan of the place. What we got was the worst service I have ever experienced. The food was not the greatest but getting the order wrong and throwing the dishes at us were a bit offside."}
