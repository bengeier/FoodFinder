{"text":"This place's food is horrible. I definitely would not recommend it. The food isn't cooked properly and tastes poor in quality."}
{"text":"A tiny Carribean jerk chicken joint located in a gas station parking lot that does take-out and catering?! You don't really go into this place with high expectations.  Surprise surprise though, it actually serves some pretty fresh tasty food.  They have a $5.99 lunch special Monday to Friday. All of their dishes come in two sizes (small or large) but the small is more than enough to fill you up.  Here's the drill, you choose a meat (jerk chicken, jerk pork, curry pork, oxtail, goat, stew, etc.) and it is served with a side of rice and peas. You can also go the roti route for a little extra money. (Check out their website for pictures of the food and a full menu).  I still haven't gotten around to trying their porridge...but I really need to. It's suppose to be pretty great!  This take-out restaurant is small (just a counter), authentic and independently owned so worth checking for that reason. You should definitely stop by if you're in the area (*ahem* Centennial students)."}

{"text":"I am sooo mad I went to this place!! the food is not good at all!! the curry was extremely watery like if it was a soup and taste really bad. My wife ordered the chicken stew and it was disgusting.... I went back straight up and told the owner that for $30 dollars this was real bad Caribbean food. He didn't offer any help and kick me out of the store by saying that his policy was not refound!! but it get worse!!! I left the food on the counter but as soon as I got back to the car my wife asked me to go back and throw the food on the garbage, I went back inside and what I saw I couldn't believe!!! this dirty A-Hole was putting the chicken back in the tray!!! this is horrible!!!"}
