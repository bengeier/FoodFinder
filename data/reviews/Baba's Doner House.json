{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place at all. Doner sandwich is great, but Baba's famous dinner is the go-to. Solid portion for a great price, both beef and chicken are great. Generous amount of rice, not many potatoes but you honestly won't want more of them once you get halfway through the dish. I've Ritualed here more than a handful of times and I've never not enjoyed it. Always quick service and the dudes working there are always grateful that you have decided to eat their food."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try Baba's when they opened in my hood over a month ago and boy was the wait worth it! Tender beef doner over a bed of fluffy rice drizzled with garlic sauce and hot sauce served with fresh garlic pita and salad... Im getting hungry just thinking about it. So delicious and big portions will definitely get you stuffed and satisfied. And the best part is there is an actual \"Baba\" who is the dude in the logo making your food. You can't get more authentic than that! Service is friendly and fast as well. Will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Great location and great food. Best doner I've had after Germany. Service is great; very helpful. They care a lot when they prepare your food and they are happy to add extra ingredients even if they are not on the list. It is a very small shop so it's good if you're looking to have a quick lunch. Sandwiches are a tiny bit pricey."}
{"text":"So good. One of the best shawarma places I've ever been to. Service was very good. Food was excellent. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I don't usually expect much from a Foodora order no matter the reputation of the restaurant I'm ordering from but holy crap was the food good!  We got two dinners, a chicken and tofu one, both with rice and potatoes.  I'm usually not big on Mediterranean because almost every time I get is either too dry or too greasy - however, Baba's was just perfect.  Full of flavour and a generous portion for the price. I absolutely recommend Baba's Doner House if you're in the mood for a good hearty meal made with care."}
{"text":"Stopped off today for a quick lunch. There were some people before us but they were helped in quick succession. We were pretty hungry so we ordered 4 dishes of the beef dinner for a party of 5 (my parents shared). The beef had great flavor and was good quality. The garlic sauce was bomb. We got more of that soon after we started eating. Dishes were polished off in about 10 minutes flat. So good.  The owner was super nice, and informed us that it was his mom's recipe. My brother thought it was better than the Halal Guys which has opened up shop in several locations in southern California recently (the famous Halal cart in NYC formed a franchise to open brick and mortar stores). He really liked the rice and bread as well.   Would definitely come here again if I were to be in town. Didn't get to try their \"pizza\" but it looked amazing when we saw another customer pick up theirs.  Give this a try if you are in the area! Yum."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from this place and I can't wait to go to the restaurant and try a full dinner in the future.  We got two beef doners and a lachauman to share and they were all great. The meat was tender and perfectly seasoned, the vegtables were nice and fresh and the bread was a big step up from the standard pita wrap.  We also got a garlic sauce and a doner sauce on the side and both were excellent."}
{"text":"Baba has great service! But what's better is the chicken or beef plates! Go for the regular size to get all 3 sides of rice potatos and salads because it is definitely worth the $3! Everything goes so well together and if you're missing one item it won't be as good! The chicken and beef was seasoned and cooked so well and the portion is very generous! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars for sure!  Such a friendly staff. So welcoming. Clean establishment. I think they must had been busy as the beef was sold out. I got the chicken instead.  But I will be back again to try the beef!!  Great addition to the neighborhood.  Prices are reasonable for this area and nice to know that the place is family owned.    Only have a few pics as the review before me did a great job!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot here, but man is it ever expensive.   Got a good dose of sticker shock when the small chicken plate is a whopping $14.99 and portion size was tiny.  Lose those double compartment plastic containers, they're a real ripoff"}
{"text":"Best place for doner in Toronto. Made fresh. Sometimes they sell out so go early. Owners are super friendly as well.    5/5 *"}
{"text":"Baba's Doner House opened recently in our 'hood.  Gord and I both ordered small chicken dinners and took them home to eat.  I got mine with potatoes and rice and Gord got his with rice and salad.  Ali, the owner, put the three sauces on my dinner ... doner sauce, garlic sauce and hot sauce.  Gord got his doner sauce and garlic sauce on the side (he's not a big sauce guy).  I've never had a doner dinner before and it was really good.  The rice was nice and fluffy.  The potatoes had a tasty sauce.  The meat was good (Ali gave us chicken and beef so we could try them both ... thanks, Ali!).  The three sauces were good mixed in with the dinner.  I'd go back!  I'm glad I got an extra dinner for my lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This pace was great! We were visiting Toronto from for the weekend and stumbled into Baba's Doner. Not only was the food phenomenal and service was amazing. We ended up rerunning to Baba's multiple times during our four day stay and left with joy every time. He type of joy you get from listening to Bethoven or watching the sun set from the top of a mountain surrounded by trees in the fall."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stumbbled upon Baba's when out looking for dinner, and we were pleasantly suprised by the friendly staff! We were visiting from Los Angeles and were super unprepared for our first night in Toronto. We hadn't gotten anything set up with debit cards or getting Canadian cash, and the staff were so accommodating in letting us pay with US cash and giving us tips for seeing Toronto. They were super friendly and chatted with us about their experiences in LA and gave a great restaurant recommendation for New York when we told them we were going there next.   The food was fantastic also, we both got the chicken plate with rice and salad. They put on all 3 sauces and they were delicious. I especially liked the seasoning on the rice. Portion size was also very generous, especially for the price. Overall, you can't go wrong with this place. Will definitely try to come back if we ever return to Toronto!"}
{"text":"My name is Evelyn and I have a serious delivery addiction.   I'm fairly certain my family ate out 5/6 last nights. But hey, we switched it up and my daughter ate her vegetables. Best of all, I got to try some great new places, like Baba's. My husband and I split a chicken and a beer doner and we loved them both. The way the bread soaks up the delicious flavours makes it much more whimsical than your average middle-Eastern inspired wrap.   I'll be back, Baba boo."}
{"text":"Awesome doner sandwich. Bread was warm light and crispy. The meat actually tastes great and toppings were fresh."}
