{"text":"Do you need something sweet and delicious? Chocolates? Candy? Cupcakes? Popcorn in a ton of crazy flavors? They have it. I especially love the fun popcorn flavors and the cupcakes. This place just recently opened and is run by the same people who have the stands at the West Side Market. Don't park in the lot across the street; I think it's easiest to park on a side street & walk around the block. Just a heads up: I found their dark chocolate treats to taste more like milk chocolate and the milk tasted like white chocolate to me."}
{"text":"i have been to cleveland three times and each time I have been to Campbell's.  i can't decide which i like better - the popcorn or the cupcakes.  The new white cheddar dichotomy popcorn is heavenly.   My last trip I had a turtle cupcake and buckeye - so good I could not stop.  The service is great - I go to West Side Market.  There is always a crowd but I have never felt rushed.  delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Campbell's and their sweets shops!  Try the Red Velvet Cupcakes! AMAZING! 

Support this amazing family and their venture to \"bring the sweet back to Cleveland\"! 

It's worth the extra mile run :)"}
{"text":"This is the best popcorn ever! So many flavors to choose from. Try the dicotomy."}
{"text":"The dichotomy popcorn - cheese and caramel - is entirely overrated.  However, the cheddar cheese jalapeno popcorn is to die for.  The cupcake truffles - especially the wedding cake, the M&Ms, and the buckeyes - are great, and not too bad on your wallet at less than a dollar each.  I look forward to trying the millions of other flavors listed on their website.

For those who don't know, Grandma Campbell's cupcakes are the same as Grandma Frieda's in the West Side Market.  Apparently the owners are doing some rebranding for consistency."}
{"text":"We didn't think the popcorn was that great, but the popcorn ball was delicious that we got there! Also, we got a toffee nut cookie, which was good. The best thing though was the German Chocolate cupcake. It was really good!!"}
{"text":"BEWARE: MOLDED CAKE BALLS. 
Ordered cake balls from Ohio City location on 01/09/18. Bite, chewed, and swallowed half of the cake ball before realizing the taste was revolting. Looked underneath the chocolate coating to find white fuzzy mold. Hours later and still sick to my stomach. If you like moldy cake balls I strongly recommend. Otherwise, check your balls first or steer clear altogether!

Update: I contacted the business- they were very apologetic and worked hard to resolve the problem in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I am giving a five star review because I have been to their popcorn and cupcake stands quite a few times in past couple of years. Recently, they opened a store in Lakewood, right next to Melt."}
{"text":"Great value for updates modern bakery- not nearly as pricey as others but same high end quality."}
{"text":"The dichotomy is to die for!!! Campbell's is amazing! I've been to the Lakewood location, the westside market and I've been happy with them all. I still want to try more flavors, I've sampled them all but I definitely want a bag to go home! I'm an avid popcorn lover."}
{"text":"A great addition to Lakewood! Stopped by for some unique cupcakes for my Mom on her birthday. Lots of delicious choices. I loved the buckeye and red velvet especially. They also carry complimentary coffee for patrons from a local roasting company.

I will be back for popcorn next time!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan, and a converted popcorn lover.  Before encountering Campbell's at a Yelp event, I thought I didn't like popcorn.  As I came to learn on Campbell's factory tour (which was awesome!), the reason I like Campbell's and not other popcorns is because of the type of corn kernel they use.  Apparently the kind they use has less of the kernel shell that gets stuck in your teeth, which was the whole reason I always hated popcorn.  Obviously, the tour was very informative.  It was also fun.  We made chocolate dipped caramel corn balls, and the tour price included a voucher to spend in the gift shop!  I am so addicted to their treats now that I keep trying to come up with reasons to buy bags of popcorn as gifts for people so I have an excuse to visit the store."}
{"text":"Best popcorn in Cleveland.  It's addicting!  Good flavor choices.

The parking around the West Side Market and 25th Street can be difficult, but it is worth it for the popcorn and treats."}
{"text":"Campbell's Popcorn Shop is the latest food destination I'm recommending to people. Usually it goes \"OMG. I wish I had some Dichotomy Mix right now!\" It doesn't matter the time of day, or if I'm hungry. I just love the cheddar/caramel corn mix. People usually say \"Wutch you talkin' bout, Willis?\" and then I tell them all about Campbell's. I like that I can try any flavors from a neat little vending sample machine from the counter. There are also chocolate creations like turtles and peanut butter cups. You may purchase your popcorn by regular or large bags, or tins! I made a special trip on Saturday to Ohio City just to stop and get a couple of bags of the Dichotomy for double booked Saturday parties. I love it when you introduce people to a superior food product and you can literally see the moment while they're taking their first bites and they realize it is superior. I had several of those moments on Saturday night. So far, no matter how good the other flavors are, and they are all good, I have only bought dichotomy. When you've found the best, can you really deviate? Don't Deviate from Dichotomy is my slogan for 2012. Dig it?"}
{"text":"Very cool store right near the West Side Market. Its a little bit off the path but worth the block or so walk. Very interesting selection in a very \"sweet\" old building. I enjoyed looking around and would recommend it for a nice break from Ohio City."}
{"text":"So so good.  They have about 5 samples a day of popcorn you can try out of the over 20 flavors they sell.  I haven't bought the same kind yet, always buying something I've sampled.  Their buckeye caramel covered apples are to die for.  I've tried 5 of their cupcakes, still not thrilled with them.  They have a case of chocolates too that is very good. The staff is very friendly.   They have a very, VERY, narrow ramp into the building for wheelchairs, if not caught just right, its possible to miss it with a wide wheel chair.  Usually a staff member runs to the door and has to help me push the chair into the building. They do have two stands in the west side market.  One with the popcorn and chocolates and the other with their cupcakes in 2 different locations."}
{"text":"One word...CUPCAKES! We were out of town and it was my son's birthday. Well you can't have a birthday without cake! So we Yelped bakeries and this place came up! The cupcakes are delicious and come in a variety of flavors. They have candy too; chocolate covered pretzels, caramel cups, peanut butter cups, turtle candy and on on! Great staff, too!"}
{"text":"One of the most unique candy stores around!  An assortment of popcorn, taffy, cupcakes!  this place is Sweet Tooth Heaven!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and free samples. The popcorn flavors are various and scrumptious.  The Carmel apple is a must have. Dichotomy is my fav. Fair prices for all their items.  I am addicted."}
{"text":"I love the different varieties of chocolate covered pretzels they have.  The chocolate to pretzel ratio is what it like lol (if that makes sense).  It's not too much chocolate coated on the pretzel.  They have this Turtle Pretzel that is sooo freakin' yummy.  They only thing I craved today was pretzels lol and I ran there to pick up a few...it was hard to leave the place because everything look so dee-lish.  The popcorn they have can be a little daring.   I tried I think some kind of Jalapeno popcorn and even though I love hot and spicy stuff...that left me in tears lol really!  But the carmel corn, when it's warm, is really good!"}
{"text":"Oh my the sweet smells! We walked in the door and the aromas of caramel and popcorn made you immediately want to eat everything in sight - or at least try it! And try them we did! I sampled Root Beer Float Popcorn, White. Cheddar and Kettle Corn Dichotomy, Kettle Corn and several I have forgotten. When I snapped a pic of the room and sent it to my 15 year old she texted back \"BUY ALL THE POPCORN!\" So we bought four bags!!! Lol! 
Said 15 year old wanted Bacon Cheese Popcorn and the White Cheddar Dichotomy. We also took home Root Beer Float and Kettle Corn. The only bag that wasn't devoured was the Dichotomy. And it still got eaten... just not as quickly. 
But back to the shop itself. It's so bright and cheery. I loved taking a break from walking in the heat. We grabbed ice cold waters there and sat and nibbled before heading into our next find. I also took the time to find out about he tours they offer! Groups of eight for just $5 each and you get a voucher to use before you leave! We're planning to get a group together and go soon. 
I did not sample any of he candies this trip but I plan to next time for sure! Thanks Campbell's for a great first visit we will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Saaaaaaweeeeeeeeeeeeeet...

...get your popcorn on.  They have so many crazy types of flavored popcorn.  The best is the classic caramel.  And I'm not talking about your old school overly sweet, stale Cracker Jack .. this is some high quality stuff.

 And if you can't make up your mind they have tasters for each.  It's like magic in your mouth!  

I went home with a bag of caramel and a caramel apple.  mmm mmm mmm."}
{"text":"I wandered in here by chance one day while visiting Cleveland. By \"wandered in\" I mean, I saw the sign and ordered my friend to park the car immediately. I had a terrible sweet tooth, the kind where you can't be held responsible for your actions. Anyway, I walked (power walked/awkward-walk-where-you-are-holding-back-running'ed) in and gazed upon a most plentiful clinic for my sweet tooth! Chocolate covered popcorn, along with everything else you could possibly dip in chocolate! Yummy! I quickly gathered together my chocolate covered cure and feasted in the car on my way back to Cincinnati! I hope they open up a shop near me soon!"}
{"text":"Popcorn has always kind of been an unremarkable snack to me, but then again, put some butter, salt, and or chocolate on anything and chances are it's edible. 

BUT, thanks to an aimless afternoon at the west side market, I probably will never be without a bag or 3 stashed away somewhere. You will never buy microwaved popcorn again! I know I won't. All those wasted years... I highly recommend their cherry cola popcorn! Yes people of yelp, cherry cola flavored popcorn. That alone is worth a visit. If you are looking for some traditional sweet treats, their caramel corn is always fresh, made right in front of you! 

A really great value is one of their large gift tins, 2 or three of their fresh and unique flavors and you are set for 3 movie nights to come! 

PRO TIP: While they have a stall in west side market, they have a store right across the street. That way, you can skip some of the ridiculous lines."}
{"text":"I randomly stumbled upon this location while walking to the rapid and man I'm glad I did! It's a little further down west 25th but it's easily accessible. The workers are fast and friendly, and when you walk in you get a burst of sweet heaven. Popcorn in practically every flavor you could think of, beautifully made cupcakes, coffee..etc. I recommend the cheese popcorn, simple yet scrumptious. You won't find better hand made sweets for the price."}
{"text":"Went to the Lakewood location after passing by it numerous times. We were waited on almost immediately even though it was busy. The cotton candy tree is magical, & some of the best I've ever had. The strawberry cupcakes took me back to childhood. For everything we bought, I thought it would be more expensive. Truly a pleasureable experience, & great quality candy, popcorn & bakery for what they charge. We will definitely be back, especially after being disappointed by many bakery cupcakes in the past. Highly recommend. :-)"}
{"text":"I feel slightly terrible because when I went in here I ordered a cupcake (from Grandma Freda's!) and then proceeded to nosh on free popcorn samples for 15 minutes.  It's free popcorn...don't judge me!  

I have zero complaints about Campbell's.  Every flavor I tried, which was EVERY flavor, was delicious.  The staff here is really helpful too.  Favorite flavors include vanilla butternut and the dichotomy.  Everything else is good, but not as good as these two."}
{"text":"I stopped by their stand in the West Side Market for a cupcake, and later came here to get popcorn and buckeyes. The cupcake was amazing--key lime. I'm not usually a fan of dense cupcakes, but this one was moist and tasted great. The frosting was sweet but a little tangy. The popcorn (I tried fruity and got dichotomy) was soooo good. The buckeyes were just so so in my book. (My sister makes better ones!) Overall, definitely worth a stop. :)"}
{"text":"Dichotomy Popcorn is the only thing you need to know. The chocolates and cupcakes re delicious as well, but the dichotomy popcorn is the thing that will keep me loving Campbell's forever. 

And I totally Agree with the person who said that legalization of cannabis in Ohio should be followed closely by the opening of several Campbell's stores around the city."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!.   Everything is always fresh and delicious.  I am a home baker and definitely a cupcake snob.  The cupcakes here are delicious.  There are 8 varieties offered during the week and additional flavors offered on weekends.   My absolute favorite is the lemon flavor, which is only offered on weekends.  I've tried the strawberry, red velvet, salted caramel, wedding cake white and the list goes on and on.  If I go to lunch on West 25th, I always stop her on my way back to work.  I pick up cupcakes for home and usually bring back a few for my co-workers.  The price is right, more bang for your buck than other establishments at $2.50 for an oversized cupcake.   I also enjoy the Dichotomy popcorn which is caramel corn and cheese corn mix.   It's not Garrett's in Chicago, but pretty darn close.  There are multiple varieties of popcorn (free samples), chocolates and other goodies.  This place is definitely worth a field trip.   They also participate in PayCloud.  Once you sign up and after you spend $60, you save $8.00 on a return visit.  I earned my return visit today:-)"}
{"text":"Caramel Apple, Nacho Cheese, Dichotomy, Cocoa, Banana Split all delicious treats in and of themselves but when they come in popcorn form it just makes it extra delicious!

Consistency of flavor is what makes all these treats so good. They are true to their inspiration and make you wanna slap your mamma. Love, love, love them! Plus you can sample to your little hearts content. Honestly what more can you want from a store?

They also offer local coffee beans, cupcakes and chocolate treats that I did not try. My obsession with Campbells is based on the popcorn alone."}
{"text":"When you open the door's of Campbell's the dense aromas of butter, sugar and popcorn waft out, wrap their arms around you and pull you inside. This is the kind of smell that Yankee Candle's R&D department would kill for and fortunately all you have to do is head over to Ohio City.

If you need a cupcake fix you need look no further than Campbell's. They've got dozens of flavors to choose from (their store selection rotates so keep an eye out for your favorites) all made fresh daily and they all look amazing. My favorites are red velvet, Samoa (think the Girls Scout cookie), and sea salt and caramel. They nail the frosting, creamy, just the right amount of sweetness and always in the right proportion to the cake. Speaking of which, the cake is wonderfully moist, buttery and airy. I can honestly say they are the best I've ever had at a cupcake shop.

If flavored popcorn is more your thing you can't find any better. With savory and sweet options you can find your match with flavors like beer & cheddar, dill pickle, cajun, strawberries and cream, caramel apple and pina colada. And with samples always available you can try before you buy.

Don't think they stop at cupcakes and popcorn, either. They've also got goodies like caramel and candy apples, cake pops, chocolate covered Oreos and chili peppers and plenty of other tooth tingling treats. The bottom line, head over to Campbell's for the cupcakes and corn and while you're there take a look around; you never know what you'll find."}
{"text":"Aaand... I'm dead. I must be. I've died and gone to fat kid heaven. Popcorn, pretzels and cupcakes oh my. And free samples of every flavor of popcorn. They have mastered the art of salty sweet with there delectable puffed kernels of goodness. The best by far is dichotomy, it has the richness of Carmel and the savorieness of cheese. It sounds weird but most amazing things do."}
{"text":"We visited Campbell's at the Westside Market for the first time this past weekend.  Their cupcakes are amazing!!  There are a ton of cupcake places around these days, but the five of us decided these cupcakes might just be the best we've ever had.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"They just make em like this any more.  I'll bet anyone they can't stop in here and NOT buy something.  From sweet to salty they have an amazing selection of items at fair drives - especially compared to tourists trap places that you usually find these goodies.   Try ordering online and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"We've already established that in my eyes, popcorn is a sign from god that he loves us and wants us to be happy. 

If that's true, then Campbell's Sweets Factory's plethora of popcorn flavors (*ahem* white cheddar....) is like god giving me a high five, plus a fist bump. 

Seriously, how could you not love a shop full of free popcorn samples? I mean, there are at least 20 different flavors lined up on the counter to taste. Oh, and did I mention fresh, decadent cupcakes and chocolate covered goodies? Oreos, gummy worms, you name it--it's covered in chocolate. Talk about a kid in a candy store...

And everything is made in house. Don't believe me? You can actually watch them make everything in front of you. Heck, you can watch them churn out batches of homemade caramel corn and popcorn balls from the sidewalk. (And you can smell it, too) *Queue drooling now*

Beyond the delicious treats and great gift ideas (hint, hint: Yelp Shops Local Pledge), what really makes me feel warm and fuzzy about Campbell's is that it's a family run business. No, really. It's a whole family operation--and a great one at that. The Campbells have to the the nicest folks I have ever met. 

They have reasonable prices, hours and there's no reason for you to not stop by when you're in the Ohio City/ SoLo neighborhood. 

Oh, and street parking is available, just not during the hours of 4-6pm (I think.) And as mentioned before, don't park across the street in the ghetto shopping plaza. They're mean and will tow you. BOOOOO!"}
{"text":"Dichotomy popcorn - that's all you need to know.  You now have a choice between white cheddar/caramel or cheddar cheese/caramel (the former being my favorite), but gourmet popcorn doesn't get better than this!

Campbell's also has yummy cupcakes, buckeyes, chocolate dipped pretzels, etc.  

The other varieties of popcorn are also yummy - some savory, some sweet. My other favorite is the kettle corn.  Some are almost too sweet, but I enjoy the different colors or how there is usually something new.  They also have some flavors out to sample - yum!

I recently bought a bunch of the dichotomy popcorn and gave the popcorn as favors for a baby shower.  Thank goodness I had an extra bag since people were asking me for more!

Definitely stop in to grab some sweets next time you're in Ohio City and don't forget to check in!"}
{"text":"With my friend at the West Side Market and we decided to get a snack. This place was great - the dozens of popcorn flavors were great! They have testing bins up front and all kinds of chocolates and other things. Got a cookie and also bought some mint chocolate popcorn. At the Market, they had all their stuff and even more samples. It was great!"}
{"text":"I was here the other day. I found their prices to be very good. I got a 1 gallon bag of popcorn for 6 bucks. It was the carmel dipped in cheese kind. I like the idea of the popcorn but after awhile I was just hoping for just a piee of carmel or just a piece of cheese. I give the popcorn 4 stars. 

I got a red velvet cupcake. I make my own cakes and I find my red velvet to be the best. This was pretty good, not amazing but good. The price I found to be lower than what I expected. It was $2.50 for a huge cupcake. I give the cupcake 3.5 stars

Then I got a cake pop. I recently started making my own cake pops and they have turned out incredible so I wanted to try others. You get one pop for $1.50. I tried the wedding cake flavor. It was mediocre at best. It kinda felt like there was too much frosting added to the cake making it appear to be raw. And then I found a hair in my cake pop. So the cake pops gets a very low score for me. 

Overall, it was cheap, I would get popcorn again and maybe a cupcake if I was really craving it."}
{"text":"Have not had the pleasure of visiting the store, but we have tried Dichotomy thanks to a thoughtful group that sent us some, as a gift. Dichotomy is not ordinary cheese corn on any level-it is addicting sweet-savory goodness that's a challenge to pass up in the grocery aisle. 
Giant Eagle Legacy Village stocks a veritable wall of Campbell's popcorn. I have a love-hate relationship (true dichotomy) with that wall *blushes* !!
Campbell's popcorn is a true, local, high-quality indulgence-having the luxury of time to watch a great movie with a bag of this popcorn in hand is my simple wish."}
{"text":"Great popcorn! Dichotomy was the best. Chocolate covered gummy worms are great. They also carry honey hut ice cream. Strawberry is amazing. Maybe crumble some of the chocolate on top? I love doing that! Choc pretzels with M&Ms are a fave of mine too :)"}
{"text":"Love this place so much.  The cupcake variety is good. And they are aka ways moist.  I love the popcorn. My favorites are diconomy and cinnamon. The people are always cheery.  I go as often as I can.  I recently had the dark chocolate Buckeyes. Yum."}
{"text":"Cupcakes you could eat with a fork.

Perhaps the most dense, moist, and filling cupcakes I've ever had.  the buckeye has some sort of delicious peanut butter blend that gives you a lovely peanut butter compliment to the moist chocolate cake, but doesn't have your tongue sticking to the roof of your mouth."}
{"text":"I could not check in here because my phone ran out of batteries, but I had to write a review... This place was AWESOME! So many different varieties of popcorn flavors to choose from. Plus you get a chance to sample a few different flavors too. Always a good thing!!

They also have many other sweets like chocolate covered oreos, etc. In addition to buying popcorn, my wife and I also picked up a cupcake. It was very good!!

I'm thinking ... Christmas gifts for my neices and nephews!!"}
{"text":"The most wondrous cupcakes ever await you here. With flavors too amazing to wrap your mind around. They have the best Red Velvet.....ever!"}
{"text":"Campbell's is a Cleveland institution everyone should try once. While you'll find super yummy selections of cupcakes, chocolates, caramel apples and other goodies, for me, its all about the popcorn. Especially at this location, located just a few doors down from the West Side Market.

Campbell's is iconically known for its popcorn selection. They're always adding new and seasonal flavors and have tasting dispensers for nearly every popcorn. Kids (or, errr, adults) will love turning the knob wheels and sample all types of flavors. I love this because it encourages me to try new things! My favorite popcorns are the Pizza and the White Cheddar. Legit, that Pizza popcorn is so on-point it's almost shocking. The Dichotomy popcorn is their most notable flavor, but I've also tried some crazy stuff here, like French Toast and Ranch.

They also do online ordering, and the last I checked, I *think* if you re-use your popcorn tin, you get a discount on future popcorn. I never considered myself a person who loves popcorn, but if I'm anywhere near West 25 and have a decent parking spot, you best believe I find my way inside to Campbell's for some goodies. Also, you can't beat Campbell's as the ultimate, versatile Cleveland-esque gift! It's always a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"Havnt had too many of their chocolate confections but I will slap my Grandma for a bag of their Dichotomy popcorn!  Its cheese dusted with caramel maybe?  Cheese and kinda sweet.  Holy hell is it good.  They have so many flavors its hard to choose.  Service can be a bit slow..especially if they are busy packing up or taking an order on the phone.  Popcorn seems somewhat fresh and once I had a great coupon..buy one bag, get one free.  Thats what Im talkin 'bout Willis.."}
{"text":"If you love gourmet popcorn then you will love this store! They offer free samples that will blow you away and the prices are extremely  fair. The workers are very nice and it is a great place for families. You can watch the workers make the wide selection of popcorn behind the counter which is a great experience  for children young and old. 

I walked out with pomegranate and basic caramel popcorn, a Minion made out of marshmallows and dipped in white chocolate  and a delicious  cup of coffee that they make in house. 

Everyone should visit Campbell's!"}
{"text":"Friendly folks and great cupcakes (I cannot stop thinking about the m&m's cupcake). Parking can be a hassle depending on time of day (no street parking from 4PM-6:30PM). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm hooked on Campbell's popcorn! 

I've driven by this place several times and figured it was time for a visit since the peanut gallery (my co-food experts: my children) were in tow.  There's a sign in the front advertising free samples so why the heck would we ever pass that up;)  We tried several varieties of popcorn but went home with Cotton Candy, Caramel Apple, Jalapeño Cheddar, and Garlic.  The popcorn here is absolutely perfect! This beats movie theater popcorn by a 1000%.  There's also a big variety or chocolate covered everything: pretzels, cookies, strawberries and jalapeños. They also have some pretty big cupcakes, caramel and candy apples.  We did not indulge further because we did not want to spoil our lunch but will be going back to try all of their extra goodies:) If you're in the area pay them a visit, you won't be disappointed if you do:)

Update:  I visited Campbell's again today (1/20/14) and purchased half a dozen cupcakes.  These were by far the worst cupcakes I've ever had.  We were not able to eat them because they were too sweet.  My kids took sips of milk in between bites but they were not able to finish them.  If three young teenagers aren't able to eat them, then you know there's a problem.   

I'm still giving them five stars because their popcorn is worthy of this rating.  To the management:  please stick to the popcorn and leave the cupcakes alone."}
{"text":"I think I would set up camp in their store if I could. If you like their stand at the West Side Market, do yourself a favor and go a few blocks down W 25th to their store. It smells absolutely amazing between the popcorn, baked goods, and chocolates. I took my mom, aunt, and cousin, and between the four of us, we walked out with just about one of everything. I paired a bag of their dill pickle popcorn, my personal favorite, with a chocolate-covered Oreo in a cute ladybug design. Salty and sweet goodness. Mom got a chocolate turtle and was not disappointed. We also sampled the cupcake truffles, bite-size nuggets of happiness. I took pity on my husband and brought him a buckeye cupcake, which I was more than happy to help him with later. 

Good thing they don't have wifi and tables. I may never leave."}
{"text":"I recently popped into this shop to see what they had in the way of unique gifts for my customers.  Fell in love!  So many different flavors of popcorn to choose from and special items during each holiday!  I ordered the Green Beer Popcorn for my St. Patty's Day deliveries this week!  They have a website and will ship!"}
{"text":"Dichotomy

What?!? What is that?  How do you pronounce it?  I don't know, but what I do know is that this was my favorite out of all the flavors they had out (for sample)  I tried a couple and I was wowwed.   It was sweet and had a hint of saltiness.  I thought I wasn't a big fan of mixing sweet and salty but I guess I was wrong.

They have a whole variety full of flavors but that one was the one that stuck with me.

I live in NYC (I was in Cleveland for a friend's wedding last weekend)  I wished I could have gotten more bags of popcorn but thank goodness to technology, I can order bags of popcorn from their website.   My only question is, how big are the bags.  They have a 12ct bag box for $33.

I guess I'll order it and update the size one day."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of caramel or savory popcorn you've got to stop by Campbell's in the West Side Market.  If you don't know what you want you've at least got to stop by and try the numerous samples - though chances are once you try a handful you get hooked. The dill pickle, smoky hot, and vanilla butter not are three of my favorites. The dichotomy popcorn, a mixture of carmel corn and cheese popcorn, is something you've got to try.There's a ton of candy here too including chocolate covered jalapeños. That's a painful experience, trust me."}
{"text":"puffy clouds of corn
 extreme dichotomy blend
hot sweet and crunchy

When they legalize weed in Ohio, they should open a shop on every corner.

Carry on..."}
{"text":"We all know that popcorn is good for you.  Now thanks to Campbell's, it is as \"Mmmm-Mmmm Good!\" as other things with the name Campbell's :)

I was lucky enough to have my first taste of Campbell's last night at a Yelp event, and man was it awesome!  I downed an entire bag of cheddar bacon last night and just polished off White Cheddar Jalapeno Popcorn today.  Like I said, Mmm-mmm good!  

There are also sweet flavors of popcorn for people who want a little something to balance out the savory.  I'm a fan of cheesy/savory anything, and if it's added to something healthy, that just means it's delicious and healthy!  

Definitely a must-visit destination no matter your craving!"}
{"text":"This place does deserve a five star. But my mind is saying give it 4. I love buying my sweets from the stands at West Side Market and I find the environment at the WSM much better. I do have to give them this though, I love both the popcorn and the cupcakes and it has better hours then WSM. Also, the interior is beautiful and really well done. I so hope that they will expand more as they definitely have a market in both Cleveland Heights and probably Westlake."}
{"text":"Is it weird to say that this is the best smelling store and I wish I could bottle their scent and make it into a lotion? 

Probably, but I don't care. This place is where dreams are made. 

Walking in is total adhd overload. Look at the popcorn! And the candy! Oooh cupcakes (everyone knows I have a soft spot for cupcakes, given my tattoo and employment)! 

Everyone is cheerful, I mean... how could you not be, working in a popcorn shop as beautiful as this?! While  I've always loved their stand in the market, Campbell's is a welcome storefront on up-and-coming w.25th .  I was shocked at their extremely reasonable prices. My friend filled up a large box for ten bucks. 

The popcorn, as always, is wonderful. You've got to try the Dichotomy, cheesy, caramelly, wonderfulness. I could totally fill up on all the samples and they'd have to wheel me outta there. Dill pickle, strawberry shortcake, fruity pebbles... all of the flavors were spot on. 

Its really a good thing I got a gym membership a few months ago because damn, those chocolates look good. They even have chocolate covered jalapeños (which I am dying to try...)! I previously stated something about making everyone's gifts this year but I think I might just cheat and buy a lot of Campbell's. J"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by the staff. When I went to the shop, there was one other person in the shop. I knew exactly what I wanted and stood at the cash register for over 5 minutes while the three staff members stood around having a discussion or playing on their phones before they acknowledged me. Not exactly professional.

The treats I had were delicious but the entire experience was brought down by the staff who couldn't even describe what flavors they had of truffles. When asked it was simple, \"I don't know these (with a point at where they were located).\" The point of me asking was that some of them were not labeled."}
{"text":"I was assaulted by the aroma of sweetness when I walked in the door. I stopped in after noticing a sandwich board on the corner of w.25th and Lorain. Such a nice addition to the neighborhood. I have a big time sweet tooth so I'm happy to see more and more sweet shops opening these days.  I stopped in to check it out, I was pretty full at the time having just come from lunch, but I ordered a couple decorative oreos to take back to work. They were decorated darling and tasted great! The service was very welcoming and friendly. 

Looking forward to going back. Next time I'd like to try the popcorn or a cupcake!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this store! 

The way this store smells will haunt your days and nights for all eternity. (A good thing).

It is so fun to watch the employees make the popcorn! 

The chewy pecan and caramel cookie from Campbell's = literally the best cookie I've ever had. 

The individual cupcake boxes are adorable, and perfect for a birthday treat for a coworker. 

This store is so fun! I can't wait to be able to bring my niece and nephew here. They will freak out over the Ninja Turtle and other character cookies."}
{"text":"Love this place!! If I could I would purchase the entire stock of chocolate drizzled popcorn!!!! Everything they make is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Best cupcake ever! I got the red velvet and it was everything I dreamed of in a cupcake. It's super moist and legit cream cheese icing. It's a pretty decent size for $2.50 a pop. I'll definitely try out the other flavours!"}

Get ready for that to be the new hit catch phrase once people start checking out Campbell's like they should be...

Campbells Popcorn has a wide selection of sweets and savories.  I'm not a chocolate fan myself so I went straight to the multiple options of popcorn.  Their flavors were diverse and exciting.  I was torn between the Southwestern Hot and the Jalepeno then what happens but one of the Campbells ladies tells me I just have to try their White Cheddar Jalepeno.  Yum!

For $3.50 a bag, these are a deal!  So super delicious and a great potluck snack in a hurry!"}
