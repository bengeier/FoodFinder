{"text":"Came back with my family and they loved it. Definitely worth a try, as every item I've tried I really enjoyed. We even had the Sand√≠a Tropical"}
{"text":"Drove all the way here to find some elote to fulfill some late night munchies and was so disappointed!   Environment- To begin with, Antojitos was located in a sketchy neighborhood that was not lit at all with some children still on their scooters in the dark. I thought surely my google maps led me to the wrong place because my end destination was some sort of convenience store, but lo and behold Antojitos was right next door.   Service- There was only one worker who couldn't speak English, until one of the male teens in the store translated for me. I was the only customer in the store, and then there was the one worker and two other males teen/young adult who were just chilling there by the register.   Food- Finally I get my elote-in-a-cup which looks nothing what I had expected it to. It was not fresh and resembled a pile of mush. I finally tried a bite and it is the worst thing I have ever tasted!  Price- There was an extra charge for using my debit card too so about $5."}
{"text":"Tried to go here. Place was in a very dark neighborhood. Very sketchy and when i went to call them and no answer. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Before finding this place we had to drive all the way to phoenix and some times I would rather not go at all. Their menu is very varied. We tried Tostitos locos, coco con chile, coctel, pepihuates and agua de frutas. Portions are big at a low price and give 5 stars on taste and price. Will definitely become a regular"}
{"text":"The Elote  was really good! The Nachos were Great as well! We usually drive all the way to Phoenix to get corn. But now we just have to go around the corner! Definitely will be spreading the word about this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! the ice cream, the street style corn and fresh cut fruit! EVERYTHING is amazing!! The ladies that work there are very kind and sweet. I've been going there for over a year now and have NEVER been disappointed."}
{"text":"I love their elotes (with everything on it) and bolis! A plus is that the staff is always very friendly. I highly recommend stopping by if you're craving a quick snack."}
