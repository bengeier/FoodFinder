{"text":"Visited for a Sunday evening dinner having turned up on a previous Saturday without a reservation and being told the restaurant was full - which I only mention as a good thing showing how popular the restaurant is.   There was a fixed price menu available but I went for the a la carte. I had arancini starter which was super tasty and a fabulous creamy pasta with spicy sausage main and was then too full for dessert. Staff were really friendly also.   Great addition to the local dining options and would definitely recommend."}
