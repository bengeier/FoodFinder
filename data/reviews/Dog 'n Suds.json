{"text":"The root beer floats are good but wasn't expecting a rib quick patty on my rib sandwich that I payed $7 for a combo. My husband got the pizza steak sandwich which was also a tiny burger that was missing the main ingredient ( pizza sauce). So in combination with the half filled fries in both our bags I felt pretty ripped off of the $20 I spent here.  A happy meal has more food in it. The meals are just way over priced."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Dog 'n Suds... I've been coming here for over 30 years now and it's always a good time. The food okay but the fact that you can still get service at your car is just fun for the kids and the kids at heart alike. The root beer is of course one of the major draws to the restaurant for us and still the best around. 
The only drawback is that it's only open for such a short time each year."}
{"text":"Hot dogs and root beer!! The BEST root beer around!!!! Love they still have these drive up food hops!!!"}
{"text":"Wow is this place overpriced!!  I had a foot long coney dog with a side of onion rings. Cost me $6.75. I'd rather go to Applebee's and get a salad with Curbside service pickup for just a couple bucks more. I waited a looooong time to get my food. It would have been even longer if I hadn't gone up to their shack to order, not knowing they come to your car. I'm giving them a 2 rating instead of a 1 because my server was very nice. They were super super busy since it was a Sunday early evening with beautiful weather. They just seem understaffed so the servers were bravely working their tails off. To sum it up, ain't never going back now, ya' hear."}
{"text":"Not coming here anymore.. the prices keep going up  and the food is like something I can get at a little league game for cheaper and be better quality example.. for fried bredded mushrooms $3.50 for 5 tiny mushrooms is ridiculous! I ordered a mushroom, bacon, Swiss burger and my wife ordered the triple Texas burger and her burger was cheaper and double the size of mine..  and we ordered mini cheese burgers for the kids and asked for only pickles and they told us it's a $1 extra for pickles!?!? That's insane


Only thing that this place has that is it's only redeeming quality is the root beer.. anything else skip all together in my opinion"}
{"text":"Dog N Suds been around for years. Got allot of great memories here mostly family and a friend once and awhile. Hope to bring my nieces here and someday maybe kids of my own?"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. The food was all American, classic and good. I got a coney dog, onion rings and a root beer. By the way the root ever is homemade and awesome, I definitely recommend it as it was recommended to me. From my understanding Dog n Suds is an Elyria and will surely be back to visit any time I have a hankering for a hotdog or some old fashioned car hop food!"}
{"text":"The Coney dogs and the root beer are awesome. My wife and I come here during the summer all the time. The prices are a little high for hotdogs but they are tasty so I will spend the extra. The fries are just okay so I skip them usually. The burgers not that great so stick with the dog and the home made root beer and you will be satisfied. It's old school with the trays on the car like old school car hops."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. We pulled up, they came and took our l order right in our car, brought it out to us and took the trash and cups. We never had to leave the car. Food was amazing and the waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"The food is okay (better then Micky D's). But you don't really come here for the food. No, you come here for the 1950's car hop experience and root beer. I've been to \"car hop's\" but they were not the real thing. I believe Dog N' Suds are the only real car hop experience out there. They have the classic trays that attach to the windows of your car, just like in the classic movies. They also, give you root beer in a classic frosted mug. It's so cool to be sitting in your car with a frosted mug and NOT a plastic or paper cup! You feel like you are you a movie from the 1950's. The only thing missing is handsome Jean Dean as your date.

There is a famous story about a dog I had 4 years ago, when I lived in the state. My father put his mug of root beer float in the cup holder and the dog stuck his nose in it. He sucked it down in less the 10 seconds. Then had a taste for root beer like zombies do for brains. It's funny how would get excited when we pull into Dog 'N Suds. He knew, he could possibly sneak a taste. He would hop around and whine! I remember, when we told the car hop gal the story, she laughed. She remembered him when we visited another time that season too. She even asked us if she could give him a little bit of root beer! Which we let her. 

The root beer is amazing. The best around. I honestly came here, just for root beer and the car hop experience. I believe they make their own root beer? It has to be? My grandparents made their own root beer when I was growing up. Their root beer tastes just like my grandparents did. I really dislike most root beers from Coke or Pepsi. I can only really enjoy real homemade stuff without all the chemicals. I believe they use real sugar and not the yucky corn syrup stuff in most pop. At least I remember it tasting like that.

I live out of state and this is one of my favorite places to visit, if I am around. Last time, I visited I didn't get a chance. It was February and I knew they closed during the winters. But if you are local hit this place up! Forgot national chain restaurants. This place has cheap food and the food is way better then Micky D's or BK! You can't even get good root beer at the yucky fast food restaurants.

One last thing, this is real! It's not the fake lame-o 1950's kitsch. It's the real car hop experience and it's just really fun!"}
{"text":"I passed by a few weeks ago. A coworker told me that the place used to be an A&W, so I decided to go back by and try it. I had high hopes because I love A&W, especially the one in Ravenna. I'm sorry to say that I was highly disappointed. I ordered two coney dogs. One with mustard and one with mustard and onions. With the first bite I tasted an overly sweet coney sauce. It tastes like a mixture of BBQ sauce, meat and several cups of sugar. The bun was cold and slightly hard. And the hot dog itself was cold. Overall, very poor."}
{"text":"This place takes me back in time. I anxiously await for it to reopen each year and make a 45 min drive to visit. It's a classic drive in with plenty of 50's authentic charm. Few Dog n' Suds remain across the US and I feel lucky to live by this one, complete with it's original Rover signage waving you in.  Root beer, fried mushrooms, and classic coney dogs."}
{"text":"The root beer is awesome. but charging 5Bucks for a bar s hot dog is outrageous. the food reminds me of the food at a concession stand at a little league game. not how i remember it as a kid. 
   keep driving by. please dont waste your money"}
{"text":"I have come here of and on for 20 years.  The food is great and the prices are right. The servers are friendly and fast.  It's a great place to go in the summer especially in the evenings. There are picnic tables to eat at if you don't want to eat in your car. The root beer is there signature item so try a float!!"}
{"text":"Hey daddy-o.  The food may not be anything special.  The dogs are, in fact, pretty weak.  Who cares?   This place is so much Fonzielicious fun.  Between the cute little car hops in the short, short skirts and the frosty mugs of insanely yummy root beer and the whole 1950s vibe, there is something for everyone to like.

My daughter thought the window trays and car hops were great.  She loooved the fries and the frosty glass mugs of  root beer.  I really liked the friendly, fast service and the completely retro-fabulousness of the place.  What's more-- apparently it's all real.  No pre-fab Friday's fake memorabilia here!

So put on your wiggle dress, roll up your t-shirt sleeves and get your t-bird a spot out front."}
