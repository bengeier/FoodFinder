{"text":"First time here, new place in town and I came in to get takeout on New Years Eve.   The app Fort Mill Location isn't available so I drove in. I have a shellfish allergy so I wanted to ask questions. -1 Star for the location being unavailable in the app.   I was greeted near immediately at the front and was brought to the bar to put in my order. The waitress was polite and brought a glass of water and a snack while waiting.   We ordered 3 dishes:  1. Chili Chicken (spicy) 2. Tandoori Chicken (medium level spice)  3. Chicken Biryani Boneless (mild level spice)   The snack was little fried crisps with 3 dipping items: something sweet, something with mint and then a tomato/cilantro type salsa. The tomato/cilantro was killer and had a nice little bite. Really good for being a simple ingredient item.   The restaurant itself was clean since it's brand new. The layout is odd since this place wasn't a restaurant before, high ceilings and a fair bit of empty space. My guess is you could fit 60 in here. Basic decor, a few TVs here and there, nothing remarkable.   It was pretty steady in terms of foot traffic and phone orders, everyone seemed to be taken care of well considering it's a new place - a good sign for me. Additionally they did a good job explaining on the phone what is or isn't spicy and gave good wait times on takeout orders.   I spoke to one of the owners who offered some Mango Lassi while waiting. He was very polite and explained some of the growing pains - new staff, wrong orders and crazy wait times since there have been 2 news articles on this location.   Onto the food!  Chili Chicken - 4/5 - great flavors and cooked well. Had just enough spice to get you sniffing but everyone has different tolerances. I really enjoyed it and the portion size was good for 2.   Tandoori Chicken - 3/5 - a touch on the dry side but the flavor was great. I got 2 legs, scored to cook faster I'd imagine. Unfortunately I didn't realize it comes with nothing so the value for me wasn't there. Spice in terms of heat wasn't bad at all, maybe a 3/10 - it was like a hot sauce type profile.   Chicken Biryani Boneless- 4.5/5 - to me this was the star of the show. The chicken was great, definitely a bite to it. The rice was perfectly done and had a really nice texture. The seasonings in general were balanced and not too much cilantro. I'd get this dish again.   Overall I would give this place another shot but in person. The value for take out wasn't there for me - $43.xx for 3 dishes. It fed 2 people but we won't have leftovers - which I'd expect at this price point.   My final word: give it a shot and experiment the menu! It seems this place is worthwhile and can offer some good cuisine."}
{"text":"Worst tandoori chicken ever had....went with high expectations but turned down drastically. Ordered tandoori chicken ,instead got old fried chicken,need butcher knife to cut and eat... Guys if ur chef don't know  how to cook something don't keep it on ur menu pls."}
{"text":"Have eaten there 3 times now, first time just two of us sitting at the bar, 2nd time take out and most recently last night, 9 of us at a table. Each time ordered a mix of vege and non-vege dishes and excellent quality every time, very intense flavors on all.  The restaurant was almost full last night (Sat evening) by the time our families arrived and yet the food came out quickly and was all at the right temp. They ran out of the particular white wine after our 1st glasses and the lady managing the bar came out and made a special effort to find an equivalent replacement and discounted this bottle as well. Really nice touch. Our families are originally from Melbourne, Australia where we have a very large Indian population and great Indian dining options and this place is just as good as anything we had there and anything else we've found so far in the local area since moving here. Obviously would highly recommend for either dine in or takeout, it's our family's local Ft. Mill favorite now."}
{"text":"Very excited to for this restaurant in Fort Mill.  I have eaten here twice this week and will come back on a regular bases.  Everything we have eaten is great. Amazing flavors with many different options for vegan and meat dishes.  This is not a fast food restaurant so be prepared to wait for made to order dishes.   I absolutely recommend ordering multiple dishes to share along with a side of naan bread. Prices are very responsible."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! Some of the best Indian we've had in this area.  It's pricey, but worth it.  The wait staff needs a little work, our table was never cleared.  But they were very kind and brought the food in good time.  Highly recommend - even tho they loved it, next time we'll leave the kids home and spend a little extra on ourselves!  Great for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Two stars only for one reason price to portion size is severely skewed in the wrong direction. Flavor an quality wise it's fantastic.  13 bucks for 3 small Kofta meat balls or 3 small stuffed eggplants as a min course isn't enough."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian restaurant in the Charlotte area. I come here often, it's very consistent and always great! I will say anything over mild is really spicy, I've learned to stick with mild only. But the food was still great as always. Always great service whenever I don't get take out."}
{"text":"Today I got a takeout of Chicken Manchurian and when I was eating I got a piece of  Scotch-Brite Stainless Steel Scrubber inside the chicken. I am not going to try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Love this new place in Fort Mill!  I was here on business and we went for a group lunch - service was wonderful and the restaurant is very clean and modern.  I had goat curry and butter naan - they got the spice level just as I had specified and the naan was piping hot.  The other dishes looked amazing."}
{"text":"We have been to the Fort Mill location several times, tried several dishes, and highly recommend it. The staff is friendly and welcoming. We have tried the following dishes (always with a side of garlic naan):  Chicken Tikka Masala Palak Paneer Butter Chicken Chicken Korma Navratan Korma   The best dish by far is the Chicken Tikka Masala. The Butter Chicken is very similar in flavor, but I would recommend sticking with the Tikka Masala sauce. Both dishes include white meat chicken cooked in a tandoor clay oven. If you prefer dark meat, you may want to try something else. We have tried many Indian restaurants over the years. The Tikka Masala here is one of the best.  If you prefer vegetarian, I would recommend the Palak Paneer. The main ingredients are pureed spinach, cottage cheese, and traditional herbs and spices. Not many Americans think of spinach as delicious, but trust me ...this is not your average spinach dish! It's very flavorful and not what you would expect of a spinach dish.  The Korma sauce is so-so here. I have had better at other restaurants. We always end the meal with my favorite Indian dessert- rasmalai. It includes milk, cardamom, and rose water. My husband says it tastes the way shampoo smells. I love it, definitely a must-try!  The only constructive criticism I have to offer is regarding the spice level of dishes. There is no consistency at most Indian restaurants. Some servers here have asked if we want mild, medium, or hot dishes....others have asked us to pick a number 1-5 for how spicy we want it, others have offered a 1-10 scale. The spice level is never consistent.   Recently, we ordered two dishes with the same spice level (medium), but while one dish was mildly spicy, the other was extremely spicy. It would be nice if there was one spice scale and the measurement of spice added to the dish was consistent based on that scale. This would ensure that every time I order a dish, I can expect consistency.    Overall 5 stars, highly recommend. We will back to try the Biryani and Tandoori dishes...(I also hope they add Bhindi Masala to the menu at some point!)"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great meal! I had Goat Curry (don't mind the bones!) and my wife had Plak Paneer. We also had chili garlic naan and traditional tandoori bread. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am not big fan of Ballantyne and Uptown Persis. But, this is Persis stand apart in terms of service and food quality. I did 3 take outs here till now and was welcomed with a big smile every time I walked in. Malai Kofta is so delicious. Chicken Biriyani was yummy too. But, Biriyani tasted little different all the 3 times. I hope the service and taste doesn't die down over time. Areas of improvement: 1. They need to pick up the phone. Getting them on phone in a busy hour is a pain 2. They missed the sides for my Biriyani in my last order. Maybe an one time mistake. Not a biggie but little disappointing."}
{"text":"Yummy food close to home. Nice Change of pace from the usual. We shared a number of dishes all pretty scrumptious."}
{"text":"The WORST Indian food I have ever had. I was so excited for an Indian restaurant in Fort Mill...I could've dealt with mediocre, but this is well below mediocre. It is just nasty. The eggplant dish we ordered was not edible. We threw the entire thing in the trash. And I'm not sure how you can make bad Tikka Masala, but they do. Absolutely no spice in \"medium\". It was an hour wait for takeout. Do yourself a favor and go to Chaupatti or Saffron. You can drive there and back quicker than waiting for your food here, and it will be 1000 times better!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the fort mill area. I had the chicken biryani and my husband had the chicken kadhai. It was delicious but the biryani is enough for 2 people. We were going to order the chicken vindaloo but our server informed us that it was spicier than the menu indicated due to a misprint. We also had the garlic naan and it was good. They also give you complimentary chips and dips. The service was good and our server was definitely on point. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"First off, I love indian food and was thus very excited for this place to open. I have now visited several times including on opening day. My comments: food is delicious/really good with a very dynamic spice profile. I recommend Chicken 65 app, Tikka Masala app, chicken vindaloo entree and chicken biryani. Their biryani is very nice and includes an egg. My only concerns with this place are the usual growing pains with a new restaurant so I am not reducing my stars at this point - namely, service is very slow and disorganized, staff is untrained and a bit rough around the edges. Also, prices are on the high end and there is no lunch menu at this point. To summarize: 1) great food; 2) higher prices; and, 3) slow and confused service..I will be back because the #1 is the most important for me."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service was enthusiastic to say the least.  Three different servers dropped in to check and make sure we were well taken care of.  If you like spicy foods I highly recommend the chicken vindaloo.  It's just spicy enough without being overwhelming."}
{"text":"Food very good and Kumar and the waitress went  above and beyond to make our experience wonderful.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So delicious. My fiancé and I split the chicken vindaloo and it was plenty for both of us. It was hot, but so yummy! The service was friendly, quick without feeling rushed and the restaurant had a good atmosphere. I would definitely recommended this place to people in the area that enjoy Indian food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Clean place, nice restrooms, fast service, and the food was amazing for the speed and price. Easy off of i77."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch time.. If you're looking for a quick in and out meal., This is not your place to go. We made it there at 12:30pm and didn't get our food till 1:11pm. And have to leave by 1:45pm.  I ordered :  Fish bites: small pieces of fish fried. The smell didn't sit well with nor, nor taste wasn't very pleasing. Very strong fish smell. I barely took a bite and couldn't even finish that.  The chicken Tikka Marsala. A must have in many Indian restaurants. However, it's sweeter than my memory of it. It's no longer savory for me. The color of the curry was off. Maybe it's a different version than I'm usual. Didn't care for that either.  Naan is on point. Came out warm and it's cool perfectly..  our server: Brooke is ok. She seem over whelmed so we have to get her attention, like water need to be fill.   Overall I'm not impressed.. Service was too slow for lunch time. Seem to be understaffed and food is mediocre!"}
{"text":"WOOOHOOOOOO!! Alright, FINALLY the wish for my most favorite cuisine in my own area has been blessed and Persis FortMill ROCKS!! Now Persis is the only Indian restaurant in the whole FortMill area.  Having moved to the area not very long ago, I was worried not to have a place for Indian food near by and normally we would drive all the way to Ballantyne or Pineville to calm the nerves.  Me and my lady  personally cannot be more happier !! Unique - Yes, the owners of this location has made it a point that their restaurant shouldn't look like just another Indian restaurant and they scored it big time.  Amazing contemporary interior design, with India's TajMahal mural on the right side wall of the restaurant (giving an feel of India) and an amazing brick panel walls and semi rustic wood shelves and trim in the bar area on the left side of the restaurant.  They have this beautiful mini wine cellar, which I have not seen before in any non-luxury Indian restaurants.  Tall ceilings, spacious area, plenty seating - booths, tables/chairs, plenty bar stools around the bar, etc., The bar looks sassy and I love that bar.  Have not had any drinks in the bar though so not sure how the bartender is but the look of that bar is amazing and hey they have this BlueMoon beer light sign (so I was sold instantly).  The rustic looking wooden shelves on the walls having various wine and liquor bottles gives that warmth to the bar and make it look more lively. FOOD - I found my new favorite now.  Its Cut Mirchi (chili pepper and chickpea batter deep fried).  Never knew Cut Mirchi and beer would go so well together.  Its a simple vegetarian appetizer.  if you like spicy bites, go for it.  It comes with a side of tangy mint chutney that is just damn awesome. Egg Curry - Simple yet so decadent.  Mildly spiced, with a touch of tangy flavor, lots of eggs cut in halves, and plenty portion.  Two of us couldn't finish it and had to pack to go. Loved the flavors and taste.   Chicken Biryani - I wouldn't say it was out-of-the-world taste but still delicious.  Aroma was great, chicken was perfectly cooked, long grained basmati rice sure had the quality, mildly spiced and good portion for two to share.  Egg curry and the biryani together was the bomb. Complimentary - Fryums(that's what I call them) and Chutneys was good and the chutneys was tasting so good along with pickled onions. Service - was good too, the owners themselves were running most of the show.  They welcomed all the guests, periodically visited the tables to make sure the guests were doing fine, asked if the food was tasting good, etc.,  for a restaurant this young (5 weeks old) they are doing a good job.  I am sure they would need a lot more support and hands once this runs full house every night. Had a chance to talk to the owners, they seemed really down to earth and taking this business very seriously.  I also talked about having a Yelp event to bring in more traffic and get this place the ultimate fame it deserves."}
{"text":"My family and I loved the food. We've been twice and each time had a great experience. Glad to have some variety in the Fort Mill area."}
{"text":"I tried Persis again today. The garlic Naan bread was absolutely tasty just like it was when I had it before. I had the exact same experience as last time regarding the Butter Chicken. The sauce was sooooo good but the chicken was dry. Chef - please stop overcooking the chicken. It should be succulent."}
{"text":"So my job took me to South Carolina this time, and as always I had to find a Indian restaurant. I came across this particular one due to yelps \"hot and new\" badge. I read some of the reviews and was a bit skeptical, but decided to go anyway. Soon as I walked in I was greeted by a server, and sat at the bar. Bartender took care of me as soon as my butt touched the seat. Corona was nice and cold, and limes were cut thick enough to get some juice out of them. I was presented with a small appetizer to enjoy while I waited for my meal. I ordered the chicken tikka masala, with garlic naan. Food arrived fairly quickly and I got down to it and enjoyed it. Overall, the food is good, the vibe is dope and service was excellent in my opinion.   The only downsides were:  *spicy food level felt like mild. Needs to be hotter. *did not like that the chicken tikka masala was cooked with green bell peppers, never had it. Prefer that they keep it original.  Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the spicy level and the bell peppers. Still, if you like Indian, I'd recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"One of our all time favorite restaurants.  Consistently great food and great service.  We live in Matthews and come here all the time."}
{"text":"My family ate there two days ago. We really enjoyed the food and had EXCELLENT service! I hope people understand that opening a new restaurant, things aren't going to be perfect from the start. There are bound to be growing pains. THAT being said, Philip was our server and he was SO helpful!  He was able to tell us the most popular dishes on the menu and explain their ingredients and flavors. Our entire family enjoyed everything we ordered, specifically because of his help. He was friendly and attentive. If you like Indian food, or if it's new to you and you are up for an adventure with new flavors, definitely try this place! My entire family agrees...even the 15 and 12 year old!"}
{"text":"So very thankful for something other than the dog food served around Fort Mill.  Very good food. If you are coming anytime soon, be patient with the timing, they are new and getting kinks worked out. Excellent food though and worth the wait. Do yourself a favor and eat here. If you're sick of wings, crappy pizza, overpriced \"gourmet\" hamburgers and yogurt, come here and enjoy something you can usually only get in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Amazing! First time here and we will be back!  Ordered cut mirchi and goat pepper fry(very spicy) for apps.  We had lamb korma (yellow) and chicken tikka masala (red) for entrees with butter naan!! Delicious!!!! Must try this place"}
{"text":"Great Indian food, a welcome addition to the rest of Fort Mill's many taverns/bars.  The service was good and the quality of the food is great. It takes a little longer for the food to come out, but it is worth the wait. The kids meals are big enough for our three kids to share one."}
{"text":"Very bad quality food and worst service. Wait time was long. Missing the authentic touch."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I heard a Persis was opening in Fort Mill because I LOVE the one in Ballantyne. The restaurant is nice and the waitress was great. The Naan is really wonderful, especially the Garlic Naan. The methi chicken, however, was a disappointment.  It smelled wonderful, but it lacked the cream in the sauce. It was also spicier than I would have liked. I will certainly be back, but I wont order the methi chicken here again. I'll go to Ballantyne for that."}
{"text":"We went as a party of 6, day after Christmas.....we were sat promptly, orders taken, (owner/ manager brought us several samplers to help pick), was very happy with everything we tried, butter chicken was absolutely fabulous as were most of the dishes, service was good, few minor kinks standard with a new place and new employees.....would highly reccomend, our only negative keeping it from 5 stars, was variety of drinks....no tea, no soda....and it was a bit chilly inside., definitely will return."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food, good service and nice atmosphere.  My husband and I tried new dishes and we were very happy with the choices. Our waiter was very helpful making suggestions and he may have lead me to a new favorite. Who knew cottage cheese could be sooo good."}
{"text":"Authentic, excellent Indian food with traditional spices and sauces . Extensive menu, friendly people and atmosphere.   Biryani is amazing (we ordered the Lamb Biryani and the paneer and mushroom Biryani. Both were extremely good. We also had the Tikki Masala which was also delicious.   The portions are large so be prepared to take home leftovers!"}
{"text":"I have only eaten there once and had the hottest meal, but, I still enjoyed it.  Indian and Thai food is where I go when I really want spicy.  I will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"To be honest, Persis have really bad reputation and quality in Charlotte. I was hesitating to try this location. However, the food was amazing. So far the best restaurant in Charlotte and nearby area. Owners were really friendly and felt like they wanted to serve us. We tried Methi Chicken, Chicken Kadai, Biryani, Bhel, Samosa Chat, chili Naan, Garlic Naan. There wasnt a single item where I could complaint. Food came on time. I would recommend everyone to try."}
{"text":"This is a new spot and as any place they were still learning some stuff. The service was a little slow just because they did not seem to have enough waiters, but we were patient because we understood this was a new business. But the food did not disappoint at all!!!! I being Indian have obviously tried almost all the Indian restraunts around Charlotte, and this place def is one of my favorites. They have a mix of all type software Indian food, North and South Indian which I loved. They had chaat which is my favorite. We got veg Manchurian and several puri for appetizers and these were great! My husband and I both Loved the Manchurian, some of the beat we have had. The entrees were huge. They were delicious as well, just enough spice. The flavors were great. The garlic Naan was a little too garlic for me but it was still fresh and food. We will def be going back here again so glad they finally got an Indian place in Fort mill!!"}
{"text":"4th time here, 3rd time was told kitchen closes at 9:40. Was running late this last time and arrived at 9:20pm however was instructed that the kitchen was closed at 9:30 today. Was denied service since she said they stated cleaning the kitchen on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Horrible. Slow. Dirty. Low quality. Flavors are just not good at all. That said, we loved the idea of an Indian restaurant coming to Fort Mill. We read some of the reviews which generally said it was great but that they were working out the kinks from just opening. WOW, what a huge understatement. This place is a joke at best.  We called the restaurant to order carry out but no answer. After a few attempts I just drove there to order. They were about 1/3 full of customers but I stood at the hostess desk for about 5 minutes before I could catch anyone to place an order. I finally got a guys attention (manager/owner maybe) and he had me go to sit at the bar for takeout. I thought he was going to take my order. Nope. I waited another 3-4 minutes before I could place my order. As I waited at the bar for for another 45 minutes, not one person asked if I wanted anything to drink or updated me that the order was going to be another 15 minutes. And even the people to my left waited 15 minutes just to get the extra refill they asked for. So, 80 minutes after we tried to call and 60 minutes after I ordered we finally got our meal. Ugh, it was sooo bad. Such a waste of my life. This place had messed up Tikka Masala, the naan was so bad and their eggplant dish was like vomit. It did not even have the coconut and peanut flavors it described. It's was like they found someone in the street to cook from a bad recipe off the internet.  My wife makes better Tikka and naan than this place. Seriously, if you have patience and want to waste a ton of time and see what I'm talking about, just go there and see for yourself. It would've been quicker for us to drive into Charlotte for some good Indian than waste it on this place. So disappointing.  They may be better off closing their doors and stop shaming quality Indian food and hospitality."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Really enjoyed it and will be back.  My son eats here at least 2x week. Butter chicken, curry chicken... all great"}
{"text":"If you wanted to have Egg/Chicken/Goat biryani , better look for other Indian restaurants. In this restaurant,they are always out of Biryani. This is my third time here and they don't have biryani ."}
{"text":"While I do enjoy the food at Persis I question some of the decisions they make.   They finally have lunch combos BUT you are limited to the items on the menu for that day. I was dying for some Chicken Vindaloo but it wasn't on the lunch menu that day so I couldn't order it. I was also told that because Chicken Vindaloo is too spicy for most people, it will not be part of their lunch menu. That's an interesting strategy - limiting the menu to a point where you will lose business. Today they lost my business along with that of the four other people that I was going to order takeout for.   I do like the food here but I'll find another restaurant to satisfy my craving for Indian. Just too frustrating to give Persis my business."}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant wonderful service right in Fort Mill!  Highly recommend!  Food is awesome and atmosphere airy and bright. Good place for family or a date night:)."}
{"text":"Our new favorite! The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was helpful and prompt."}
{"text":"I REALLY want to like this place, because I've waited a long time for Indian food in Fort Mill. But to be honest, it was a REALLY bad experience, due to a very unprepared staff. Here's why:  1. Our waiter was totally inept. We knew right away things were going to be rough when we asked for a glass of Merlot, and he asked us \"is that some sort of champagne or something?\" He was very unfamiliar with the menu, and forgot to put in multiple things we asked for. Bread never came, some drinks never came. He looked very confused, and his hands were even shaking at one point. I don't blame him. He was trying his best, but he clearly wasn't trained well.  2. It took over an hour to get our food after we ordered it. There must have been some mixup because after the manager realized we had been sitting so long, it came out promptly.  3. When our entrees finally did come, they came out before the rice and naan. Indian food is all sauce and therefore must be eaten with rice or bread. They brought our entrees with neither. When rice did come it was one small single serving for our entire table of 5. We split that between our two kids (who were starving by this point) and the rest of us sat their for about 15 more minutes waiting for more rice, while our entrees got cold. By the time another tiny bowl of rice came, our kids had finished and wanted seconds. So we waited again for more rice. The bread we ordered never came until we were done eating.  4. The bartender was rude, and likely over worked. She was mean, and it looked like it was because she had way more than she could handle.  The food was pretty good once it came. Not the best I've had, but definitely not bad either. Portions were VERY small, however that seems to be typical at some Indian restaurants. I definitely recommend ordering naan to help fill you up, because there's only about 4 or 5 pieces of meat in it.  The manager did realize things were going poorly, and gave a bunch of tables free deserts, which was nice. But that's not enough to give me confidence in returning. My impression is that they are nice people, and just need more time to figure things out. So I will wait a month or so and try again, and update my review if things have improved."}
{"text":"So glad to have an Indian restaurant closer...and it's really good!! It's super clean and nicely decorated, the staff was really nice and the menu is great! I ordered the Chana masala and my husband had chicken vindaloo...be careful because I love super spicy hot, but the hot here is truly sweating hot! It's still super good and we loved it!! Would definitely recommend and we will be back again for sure!! Was hoping the manager had come around so that we could have told him how good the food was that we ordered!"}
{"text":"Granted they haven't been open long and haven't worked out all the kinks.  I will go back and try them again, but my first impression of the food is that it lacks flavor. Everything we had, from the samosa, korma and vindaloo was on the bland side. It would be ok for someone first trying Indian cuisine, but it could be kicked up a notch. The presentation is great and the atmosphere is nice, I like how you are not sitting at the table next to you.  There is plenty of open space to maneuver."}
{"text":"New place . Good Indian food in Fort Mill area . Waiting time is little more and menu options are still limited . Loved the dal tadka cooked in desi ghee . No buffet yet ."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, however because the restaurant is so new I don't think the wait staff was very organized yet. So we did wait almost an hour for our food, but the staff were extremely nice and the food was comforting as well ad delicious."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere. Great service. Asked for recommendations from the server Landon. His recommendations were great. We will be back. You should try it!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Food is very authentic and plentiful. Owners are extremely helpful and welcoming. My favorites are the chicken tikka masala, TANDOORI CHICKEN which comes out the clay oven. Yum yum yum! Jeers rice mixed with cilantro and herbs AMAZING! Lunch combos during the week oh yeah the lamb was perfect. They also offer vegetarian options which is good. Full service bar and servers are always friendly and helpful. Definitely one of my favorite places to go . Prices are good and they offer drink specials everyday as well. The decor is nice and owner says he plans on putting up outdoor seating which I'm looking forward to!"}
{"text":"I really love this place  They food snd service was on time and amazingly. Highly recommend this place, best indian food ever."}
{"text":"As always they had the best tasting food. Tried their Salmon tikka and Lamb Chops. Love the food but service was a bit off this Sunday and table was not very clean. The waiter probably should have made some space by clearing empty dishes before shoving the check at the end of the table, forcing me to rest my hands on the folder with the check. The front desk mgr was also a bit preoccupied."}
{"text":"awesome awesome food, friendly staff and the vibe was cool and relaxed. the only ding I have is that it took forever to get our drink order!"}
{"text":"Good tasting food, still need to work out some kinks in kitchen.  Ordered Lamb Vindaloo and Methi Chicken (like a chicken curry).  Vindaloo was supposed to be very spicy and was not, Methi was supposed to be medium and was spicier than Vindaloo.  Naan was a little overcooked, did not have the fluffy inside that I remember from some other great Indian restaurants.  Overall we will definitely return as I could tell the owners are invested in improving upon their customer experience.  Still working through growing pains but a great addition to the bland Fort Mill area dining scene."}
{"text":"Curry was absolutely amazing. Service was excellent. The place was very nice and clean. We will definitely be back."}
