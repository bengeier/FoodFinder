{"text":"AMAZING!!!  authentic, fresh, delicious and wonderful service.  Was looking for good Lebanese food in Calgary. So glad we chose this place. The owner greeted us warmly and gave us fresh fatayer once we entered the place. We got chicken shawarma and donair pocket both which were incredibly fresh and made with fresh dough right in front of us.  Took some fatayer home too including zaater, spinach and cheese and meat. All phenomenal!  Owner also gave us some free sweets after lunch.  Such a wonderful place!!  Can't recommend this place enough! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the mini pies from the Beirut Bakery. Delicious. And the people that run the place and wonderful. You must try their roasted chicken mini pockets.   And they wished me a Merry Christmas too. What a Wonderful World."}
{"text":"Delicious food and the woman working was wonderful. She was so nice and helpful. The prices were great, we ended up with a ton of food for way less than expected. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Had the Spinach meat pies; been sick for days . Without getting into details went to the clinic and was told I have symptoms of food poisoning. Good food just the people working there not clean"}
{"text":"This place is more of a 3.5. When I ordered my wraps, I received a free chicken fatayar. The fatayar is like a cross between a meat pie and a pizza bundle. I would come just for that - not greasy, light pastry filled with well-seasoned chicken. Great to bring to  a party. I think it was basically a buck or just under a dollar each, depending on how many you get.    The regular size chicken wrap was yummy and filling. The beef wasn't as good as the chicken, as the meat was microwaved and a bit dry. It tasted like cinnamon was added to the seasoning. Great alternative to Little Lebannon and without the line-up."}
{"text":"Not bad. Prices are good and the owner was super nice. Gave us a free spinach fatayer. The zaatar pie was a bit mild tasting and had bad quality zaatar. Probably purchased from Superstore the ARZ brand. Lack of flavor. For 3 bucks it's a cheaper and the loaded is well priced. I think I will continue to go to little Lebanon across the street. Even though it is priced more."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Amazingly warm service, great prices, authentic menu and even the occasional sample snack when visiting. The best baklava in town!. I rarely give five stars, but this place has nothing to improve on. It's coming up on one year old and I hope it's here to stay for many more. Do yourself a favor and stop by this place."}
{"text":"Hands down the best falafel I have ever tried. Absolutely huge portions and chalked full of flavour. The chicken Schwarma had the equivalent of half a roasted chicken in it. Go for the small unless you're extremely hungry. They give you a piece of baklava to enjoy after your sandwich and its damn good to! I took a spinach feta pie to go and can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"I lived in Lebanon and can attest to the amazing authentic Lebanese food here. The owners are also incredibly friendly people."}
