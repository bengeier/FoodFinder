{"text":"It was exceptional!!! They have a wide variety of sushi dishes. Order the surf clams!!!"}
{"text":"Poor service. They can't keep up with the all you can eat demand because they are concentrating on take out service. By the time your dishes come you are defeated and tired and ready to go. The menu choices for all you can eat - they admit that they don't bring the same items as described on the menu - on no we don't make it like that on the all you can eat menu (but the only description is on the full menu and its wrong!). The Thai food is not good. They add pre-cooked dried up chicken to the dishes that you select chicken in, the dishes are too saucy. Overall my daughter (age 6) told me she never 
wanted to go back several times during our meal."}
{"text":"I work around the area and come here for lunch at least once a week. The take out menu has a good selection at very reasonable prices. The quality is decent; it's not 5-star quality but you can't complain for the price you pay. They also give you a 10% discount if you pay by cash. The servers are always friendly and usually include complementary spring rolls with my orders."}
{"text":"Went there for a late night dinner, and had a terrible experience. We ordered the 30 pc sushi boat, Spider Roll and spicy salmon roll. Server made us order right away due to the time, however, the restaurant indicated that it closes at 10 but we got there at 930 but still rush us to order. The service was fast, food was out within 5 minutes unfortunately the food was awful.  The spicy salmon was SPOILED!!  We immediately notified the waiter of the salmon and he took it from us.  He comes back with the same Roll and gives us an option to keep it or take it off the bill, but they cannot make us a new one. Keep in mind at this time its only 945 and they just literally brought us out our food. How fast do they close down a ktichen especially a sushi table .

Also, many items on our 30 pc boat was not fresh and just the entire experience was awful. 

We did not get an apology for the spoiled food!!!! IF YOU'RE SERVING RAW DISHES MAKE SURE THE FOOD IS FRESH!!!"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST sushi place in town.  They are unbelievably consistent.  Every time we go, the service is good (without being in-your-face... if you like extra attention, you may not get it, but the orders are always accurate) and the food comes out fast.  The rolls are stunning, large portions, and presented beautifully.  The taste of their sushi is mind-blowing.  I've brought multiple family, friends, and business colleagues here and they all leave smiling, every time.  Definately a must-try if you like sushi! 

FYI - I've taken a lot of ppl here who have never tried sushi b4... as a first time sushi experience, this place is a great way to get somebody interested in the cuisine.

Can't say enough good things... never had even the smallest problem here."}
{"text":"Fantastic service with good quality food, ample portion size.  Received free gigantic fried ice cream for birthday! Very impressed & definitely returning soon!"}
{"text":"My kids' restaurant of choice! Much better than other sushi places in the area, but their thai dishes leave something to be desired. Stick with the sushi and you'll be happy!
The last couple times we ate in, parts of our order were forgotten and it was difficult to get the server's attention. We were charged twice for an order of edamame that was requested again when it wasn't received by the end of the meal - but this was quickly remedied. They sometimes mess up the take-out orders but the food is reliably good so we forgive them! This is a very busy place and with reason."}
{"text":"Servers are cute and friendly. Food came out quickly and tasted great. BUTT how bout this........ There was a cockroach in the washroom. My fianc√© took a picture but I refuse to look it and therefore I will not be posting photographic evidence of our findings. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"Good sushi if you're in a hurry. Nice atmosphere but service and quality is not always the best."}
{"text":"OK food but it took a whole afternoon.  It was well over two and a half  hours from the time we ordered to the time we paid.  Several of the dishes we ordered never did arrive.  The kids were going insane by the time we finally got our bill (which was a LONG time after we stopped eating and asked for it.)  I could have eaten a lot more, but did't have a few more hours to spend waiting...."}
{"text":"You would figure with all the competition in the neighbourhood, Ginza Sushi would try to excel in customer service. However, our experience last night once again proves that they have no interest in maintaining loyal clientele.
 
This used to be our go to place for so many years and for the third time, the service on October 1st was horrendous. Three of us went to the restaurant, two of us ordered sushi combos and one ordered a Bento box. The sushi platters came out relatively quickly, however after waiting an additional 20 minutes the Bento box still never came. Calling over the manager and owner repeatedly, he said it was in process and did nothing to either expedite the delivery of the Bento box or offer something while the Bento box was being prepared.
 
Never have we had to wait 20 minutes for a Bento box anywhere while the rest of our party ate their food. 
 
As we asked for the bill, our server and asked if we wanted anything else. I quickly responded \"how about the rest of our food\". She just walked away.
 
We paid the bill and walked out. This is the third time we've had an issue with service at what used to be one of our favourite restaurants for the past 20 years. I can truly say this visit was definitely the last. With all the other options for Sushi in the neighbourhood, I would not recommend going to a place where of the food quality is only ok and the service non-existent."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend on Saturday. My sashimi was ok (not super fresh), my friend liked her salmon teriyaki better. What I didn't like was the service, it was very slow and unfriendly. When we asked our waiter about one of the rolls in the menu, he either didn't understand or could not explain due to bad English, so the guy just said something in Chinese (or Korean) and walked away... We were puzzled but two minutes later came his supervisor, who was able to answer our question.  
There was also a lot of noise, they have low partitions and \"excellent acoustics\" you could hear people talking at the other end of the restaurant. My friend who lives in the area tells me that they are much better on weekdays (less crowded), hence I rate it 3 stars rather than 2."}
{"text":"Food is great. Server was awfully puzzled when I asked for a glass of water. But I guess that wasn't as bad as when I asked for a bottle of wine and she told me to relax."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Ginza for years with my parents and we absolutely LOVE this place!! I can't get enough of their food, I actually crave them specifically once a week. Mai is amazing to us (one of the owners) and always takes care of us as long-time regulars! I've been to many sushi places around North America, but nothing has compared to Ginza, both food quality and price wise!"}
{"text":"Came for my first  all you can eat sushi for $13 lunch. Sushi is very low quality but I guess thats what u get for the price. Their rolls are tasty when your very hungry and i order from them all the time while at work,it is good for takeout and delivery but all you can eat i do not recommend."}
{"text":"A lot of problems with this place.
1. I felt the waitress was being racist. She was super kind and attentive to the white customers, but was rude to the others including us. She seemed like she was too busy for non-white customers.
2. The service was terrible. It took 10 minutes after we were sat down that we could grab the waitress's attention to ask for something to drink. She more or less tossed the cups on the table.
3. Food was mediocre at best. Nothing stood out. I didn't like the appetizers. The sushi wasn't that good either. We had a couple of sushi left (because it wasn't good and we didn't want to stay in the place any longer), and when the waitress billed us, she said she was making a \"deal\" for us, and would charge us only $5 for the leftover sushi, only if we took them; otherwise, she would charge per sushi. I thought that was ridiculous; if I'm paying $5 extra for the extra food I ordered, I shouldn't have to take them with me. I threw them out at the garbage right outside the door.

There are a lot of sushi place around here. I would never return to this place, and I recommend that you go to a different place as well!"}
{"text":"They have 2 sashimi's for lunch AYCE. Thats about the only good thing i can say about this place. I hate that they have too much rice on their sushi and roll that it actually felt like I have been ripped off. It's not a bad place but there are other much better places. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"It seems as though quality of sushi varies each time you go. I've been here several times because of its decently priced AYCE lunch menu and its close proximity to my home.

- More than a few times, they would use warm rice when making the sushi rolls (gross)
- Another time their spicy salmon maki roll was falling apart and it seemed like a 10 year old kid made it

Their salmon does taste fresh though but everything else is just 'OK' at most."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a ton of AYCE sushi and other sushi places in the city and I'm unimpressed. I had heard good things about it, a couple years ago, but since... a lot of radio silence.

We finally tried it the other day for lunch, one of my friends and I did an AYCE option and the other friend ordered chicken and rice. Although a the chicken and rice was a simple order, it was on their lunch entree menu and so she figured it'd have some flavor. It was completely bland, and even worse the chicken was dried out she had never tried such awful chicken.

The AYCE sushi was even less thrilling. It took forever for even the simplest item to come, the fish didn't taste fresh, the rolls were pretty awful, the service even worse.

Not recommended. The place has a very nice setup and a nice atmosphere but the food is awful and the service, lackluster."}
{"text":"Great place, prices are reasonable and the food is consistently high quality.  Highly recommend!

I usually get the dinner for two for my husband and I which is more than enough food for 2 ppl.  Cost is $28 and comes with a Dragon Roll, assorted Sashimi, fried rice, miso, salad, chicken teryiaki, and shrimp/veg tempura,and ice cream.  Sushi portions are generous.  For take out, pay cash and get 10% off."}
{"text":"Ginza gives you a huge variety for AYCE sushi in a low price of $12.99 for their lunch buffet. The service was awesome and fast and we got all of our dishes in a very short amount of time. The $12.99 price for their  lunch buffet even applies to weekends! I will definitely be returning to Ginza soon"}
{"text":"This is a nice little place. There is plenty of seating and two rooms, the decor is also somewhat pleasant. I've been here a few times and have never had a bad experience. I'm always quickly seated and the food is good.

One thing I like about this place is that, unlike some other all you can eat places in the area, the servers are very fast. After I send me sheet in, the food comes out pretty quickly, and they come around to refill water/ tea pretty regularly.

The food is good. It's not the very best sushi I've had, but it is good and seems fresh. They have some of the standard rolls on there, so you won't be lost if you don't have sushi often, and they also have some different options if you want to be a little adventurous. 

It's not my favourite sushi place, but it's a good option."}
{"text":"We have never eaten in the restaurant so this is a review of their take out service. 

First off it's great cause they give discounts when you take out and pay cash. It's noted on their menu. 
The food is decent for an average sushi joint. Nothing spectacular but satisfies our craving at a great price."}
{"text":"We came here during the lunch special and I ordered the eel & avocado roll and the spicy salmon roll. The eel & avocado roll is fantastic but I could hardly taste the spiciness in the spicy salmon roll. The portions are pretty big and pretty filling. Service is mediocre."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a friend, they have several locations, which I have been to this particular one and the one located on Finch. A very good sushi restaurant where two people can have a great dinner for under $50. Besides good food which is absolutely a must, I love love the design of this place, it's so pretty, like sitting inside a cherry blossom! It's no surprise they have many locations."}
{"text":"They have pretty good sushi! I love their Spider Roll. The sashimi is pretty fresh however, the quality is not the high-end japanese raw fish! In considering the price that they charge you though, it's pretty descent! The reason why I eat at this restaurant is because it's close by. I think that Japanese restaurant owned by Chinese people is still missing some sort of traditional Japanese entrees."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and dinner a few times and service has varied each time but it's never been bad. I always get the all you can eat and find the quality is worth my money as the rolls were giant and filling. The chicken wings and tempura veg are also one of my favourites as they always come out hot and crispy! Will defiantly be coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"Cheapest sushi place! Where else can you find a dinner bento box for less than $13?? Prices and food are both great. I definitely recommend getting something from their Ginza's favourites. Their bento boxes also come with a scoop of ice cream! 
 
Service is good, I've been coming here for a while and I've never had a negative experience. 

follow my food ig for more reviews: @gta.eatss"}
{"text":"I never really write reviews but this one got me needing to.  

The service was atrocious...1/5
The selection was acceptable at best... 2/5
The food was average for an all you can eat... 3/5
The cleanliness was ... 2/5

First let me say this was the first time I went there and arrived at 9pm when the closed at 10pm.  

Upon seating it smelled fine but by the end of my meal the dirty dishrag smell was overwhelming.

As for the service...the soup came after some of my sushi.  The first plate came about 20 minutes after ordering (only 5 other tables were filled...so not busy).  Not once did I get a refill of tea without me having to get their attention.  I had a discount of save HST coupon which was not honored although no where on it does it say it would not be accepted for ayce.  I placed it on the table before ordering and until the very end when he brought the bill did he say that it would not be accepted.  I have since contacted VennGo to remove them from their list.

As for the food.  The a la carte menu was quite extensive serving both Thai and Japanese but the ayce menu was very limited.  Because they said they were Thai as well I tried their Tom Yum soup which was okay but too many raw onions.  I also tried their Pad Thai which was so saucy and no hints of tamarind or lime.  It for sure was a prebought mix.  As for the sushi, the fish was fresh, just very limited in selection.

With or without the coupon, I would not return.  They are WAY BETTER choices out there."}
{"text":"I gave 4 stars because the price for lunch cannot be beat. It worked out to 15$ per person before tip. The lunch menu included a fair variety of sushi considering the price, and they definitely do not cheap out on the portions. Everything is very fresh there as they are usually pretty busy. The service is similar to all AYCE sushi restaurants, and the interior is nicely decorated. One thing to note is the bathroom is very dimly lit. Overall a great place for the money."}
{"text":"First time trying out AYCE Japanese in Vaughan, everything was better than expected!

Sashimi was fresh but lacked variety. 

Specialty Rolls were A-OK. They change the name of the roll when only one ingredient is different, so many rolls tasted very similar. There were many options with cream cheese and mango, which is a favorite for some. 

Tempura was fresh and crunchy! Cooked food like terriyaki beef, was tough and too salty. The chicken karage was served as tiny pieces of fried chicken that was mostly just fried batter. 

Service was great. The whole wait staff looked like they were under 30 - all of them were friendly and made sure we were happy campers. 

I liked that the portions are small, and that they don't try and stuff you up with large amounts of rice in the sushi. We got to try almost all the rolls because of this! 

Overall, I would return because of the service, and besides, I'm content with just munching on tempura and sashimi all day."}
{"text":"In my opinion, best all you can eat sushi in Vaughan. Reasonably priced, fish is usually very fresh. Try the spicy miso soup if you want something different. It definitely packs a kick. Not on the ayce menu though"}
{"text":"You can't name a restaurant Ginza and serve AYCE sushi man, it's like calling your restaurant Peking Duck when all you're selling is roast duck. There are expectation to live up to!

Ginza is a somewhat of a boutique city in Japan, but leave it to the disregard of North Americans to name a sushi restaurant after the city--a shabby one at best. 
What is with that anyway? What if I started naming restaurants after other cities and having food only slightly relevant to the location? I mean, how is that okay?
Montreal Smoked Meats; and all I sell is smoked salmon.
Rome Delights; nothing but tomato.
Bombay; ....oh wait that one's already taken.  Damn really?

There is no WIFI, bullshit. I know there is WIFI, they just didn't name it after the restaurant so that they don't have to offer it to me. I see them boys on the computer, can't tell me they're working off of cable.

Small space with an almost private-ish section for parties up to eight, for people who would come to such a place when in a group. The chefs here casually adorn whatever smells clean as there is no such thing as uniforms in this restaurant. It is only an assumption that this is their process of getting dressed, but I'm a guy, and I know how guys get dressed when there are no uniforms. 
Fifteen dollars for AYCE sushi, whether if I may order only once or not is unclear as it not indicated anywhere. The tempura shrimp is exactly as indicated: shrimp in size. Very shrimp in size. I got four different types of rolls, and they were alright. It exceeded by non-expectations. It's not amazingly fresh, but I wouldn't expect that from this place anyway. The sashimi slices we on the chinsey size, but towards the generous end of the chinsey side. Overall, a complete misrepresentation of the incredible city of Ginza.

The delivery truck came with a box right through the restaurant, no rear entry I guess. A trendy group of young Chinese adults ran the place, the Matre'D being the least intimidating. There is actually effort in the presentation of some dishes.
Watch out for certain items though. There is a $1 charge for each piece of unfinished food, and items like the Edamame beans come in ridiculously large portions. 

They gave me the bill and 'forgot' my dessert orders of deep fried cheese cake and ice cream. GUY, no WIFI but I got my iPad still, I know what I ordered son.

I won't admit on saying this, so don't quote me. But I really hate what the Chinese is doing to Japanese cuisine here in Canada. Ginza sushi & THAI?
Since WHEN?!"}
{"text":"I had this one young lady server who was PERFECT! Came around at the perfect times, not too much, not too little, was observant and polite and so sweet and smiley. I would go back for her alone but hey, good news, food is great and reasonably priced too! Safe to say I was impressed and will return soon."}
{"text":"Service is good. No long waits of orders.  Less expensive than makimono but they don't offer drink refills which is a bummer. Food in general is good. The spicy squid tho is hard and chewy. Beef short ribs are tasty."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this place for many years, this is one of my favorite sushi places in  GTA,  SInce I visited  Japan several times, I know how real sushi should taste like and Ginza sushi comes as close as it gets. I tried other Ginza locations too but this location seems to be the best. I think they also have the best value from the takeout perspective, their party trays represent great value. I have not tried their Thai food so cannot comment about it.
Salmon Sushi/Sashimi  are the best, white tuna is also very good."}
{"text":"This was my first sushi experience, so I don't have much basis for comparison, foodwise.  

But, loved this place--it was quiet, soothing, and very uncrowded when we were here for a late lunch on a wintry-mixy Saturday. 

We got a two-person combo, which got us a TON of sushi, miso soup, and an unexpectedly delicious salad for less than $30.  

The servers were attentive, our tea was hot and bottomless, the clean, minimalistic decor and quiet atmosphere was lovely---all in all a great first foray into sushidom for both of us."}
{"text":"Took forever. Lousy service.  The food has gone downhill and we sat for almost 2 hours while they continually messed up our order. I've been eating here for 5 years, and I'm done."}
{"text":"Stirfry was absolutely delicious (I highly recommend the mango chicken, basil chicken was lovely as well,only $9 for a large serving) but the sushi looked quite rushed, not quite round or fully stuck/pressed together.

Restaurant is very attractive but most of the seating you sit very, very close to other tables, very NYC like.

Lastly, it's too rushed. The wait staff, sits around a lot since the chefs are doing all the work and they never even try to up sell you on dessert. They have a very get in get out mentality.

I had a 50% off Deal Find certificate and will go back with my second certificate just for the stir-fry but the atmosphere was too rushed for me to go back at regular price. 

** Please note they did not know I had a certificate until I went to pay therefore the service/food I received was not low quality b/c of my discount."}
{"text":"I usually come here to buy salmon sashimi take out, you can buy by the lb and have them cut into regular sashimi pieces for you, pay cash and get 10% off?, 1.5 lbs comes to aboit $22 all in which is pretty good pricing, most importantly is that their salmon sashimi is really fresh"}
{"text":"Nothing mind blowing, but a very solid sushi place nonetheless. The servers are prompt and polite. The food portions are very generous and well prepared. Sashimi slices are just humongous, and even my female friend had a difficult time fitting a whole piece of their signature roll into her mouth (and believe me, she has a _big_ mouth ;). I especially enjoyed their Eel Dragon roll with avocado, but then again I've always been a sucker for eel... Anywho, really nothing to complain about. The place even has a nice ambience to it if you get seated deeper and along the right wall (there's some funky red lighting there that I liked)."}
{"text":"They'll give you a 15% discount if you pay cash. The food was alright, except for the octopus which didn't taste fresh. The other fish (salmon, white tuna, etc) were as decent for AYCE. The beef-wrapped enoki mushroom appetizer was good. My favorite desert is the mango pudding.

But honestly if you're looking for quality sushi, don't do AYCE. You can only get mediocre at best with AYCE sushi in Toronto. We only come when in a group because our friends all eat A LOT, and it makes it easier to split the bill."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday around noon and the place was fairly empty which was nice. 

Pros 
- Clean 
- Good Service 
- Good price for ll you can eat! ($14/person) 

Cons
- Less options on their menu compared to other Ginza restaurants."}
{"text":"Weekend night, the place was packed. Serving AYCE or √† la carte, Ginza has been around for years now and appears to be a favourite for the neighbourhood. My family asked, we go to HUB Sushi up the street often enough, why not Ginza? I mean, look the place is packed it must be good, and prices look to be more affordable for the same thing.

At $14 for a bento box the menu seemed too good to be true. The menu features a good selection of sushi, sashimi, maki rolls, and a little section at the back for Thai items too! The price point was definitely comparable if not lower than neighboring sushi locations.

While we waited for food to arrive, the problems began. It was stuffy, there were flies that wouldn't leave us alone, and it was hot in there! It must've been something to do with the low ceiling, the layout blocking off ventilation, and the semi-open concept bar/kitchen. Eventually the food showed up, so we briefly forgot about our dismay and dug in.

First, too much rice. Too much rice with the bento, too much rice on my sushi, too much rice! The sashimi piece sitting atop my sushi was disproportionately thin, and there was definitely more rice than proper ratio.

Second, my specialty Atlantic Roll was weird. I rarely see a roll presented where each piece is laid out like cookies on a baking tray, never mind that the grilled scallop was lukewarm and apparently cooked with rock-solid garlic slices. Were these garlic slices dried? Fried? Am I supposed to eat them? My teeth said no, but it was hard to differentiate from my scallop bits.

The tempura was okay - not okay. I don't have much else to say.

The chicken cutlet don was dry.

The one redeeming item was the grilled salmon head (warning: if you're not a huge fish fan, avoid! You're served the whole head, skin and all, and it is definitely fishy!). It was grilled to perfection and meaty, and just the right amount of salt to bring out the flavour. It was also a sizable portion that we almost thought was too much!"}
{"text":"I went with a party of 3. Two cooked orders were served and 2 sushi orders were not served. We waited 30 minutes by which time those who were served ate their meal. The staff had the audacity to ask us if we wanted to take it to go. Others around us were served and it was clear they were overwhelmed. 
Totally disappointed with lack of service."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because I wanted sushi and my daughter wanted Thai. Unfortunately, the Thai food was disgusting. Everything coated in this weird ketchup sauce. Totally gross. I've had thai food at many different places and this was by far the worst imaginable. Won ton soup was basically hot water with a dumpling. Sushi pizza covered in that same horrible ketchup. Coconut shrimp was rubbery and dry. Dessert took 40 minutes and numerous requests to come, with no apology or comment. Staff was all cold and unfriendly except the one lady who finally brought our ice cream. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good food! Tasty rolls and really fresh sashimi! Bad service though!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing an updated review because the last party tray that I purchased was a big disappointment. I have purchased it before and it used to be scrumptious. Most recently, it was very bland. The rolls tasted as if they were missing something. It seemed they were missing the scrumptious flavours they used to come with. I believe this might be because they now serve AYCE sushi at Ginza and perhaps the chefs have omitted ingredients to make it more economical for them. I wasn't impressed. I might give Ginza another chance but I don't plan on buying another party tray from them as it was a pure disappointment.  I might consider buying a gourmet roll to see if the quality is still up to par but that's about it...

I would give my most recent party tray 2.5/2.6 stars."}
{"text":"Decent local sushi spot but nothing to write home about. It really is the best place within a 5 min drive of Promenade mall and you can call ahead for pick ups. They also have 10% off if you pay cash (pick up only).

The owner has a great memory and is always super welcoming, but we HAVE lived in the area for 10 years + and used to order once out a week. 

Now the sushi, the fish is fresh but the rolls are a bit small. They also changed their rice to vinegar ratio at some point and it is a lot more granular and less sticky than other sushi places.. Not overcooked, so that's a plus. It is decently priced (soup, salad and 3 rolls for $13) but the flavour is lacking. Also, there idea of spicy salmon is a piece of salmon w spicy Mayo...NOT minced with tempura pieces and green onion."}
{"text":"I'd give this sushi place a zero if I could. One of the worst places I've ever been too. Two things made this my first and last experience just gross.

Food: I'm a pretty big sushi fan and I like to eat almost everything. But here, I can tell nothing was fresh, soggy, tasteless and warmer than it should be. I normally get spicy salmon roll and handrolls as the first rolls to eat. Let me tell you, I wanted to spit it out and puke. The sushi was so warm, like it's been sitting near an oven. The rice was so mushy and way too sweet. The salmon tasted almost like jelly and the color of it was a so pale and white! The handrolls made me want to gag more. The Nori seaweed was so droopy and not crisp. The roll was already falling apart on my plate when it was set down by the server, and it was 95% rice with 1 or 2 fish mini fish cubes inside. After eating those two items, I dreaded for the rest of the food to come. 

I got shrimp tempura and when I bit into it there was still raw tempura flour inside! Raw flour! I told the server and she didn't understand what I was saying so she brushed it off and left and never came back until we paid. I ended up not being able to eat it because of how unappetizing everything was. 

Service: when I walked it, 12:30pm, lunch time, about an hour or so after opening and it was dead. I could hear crickets. I was seated until about 10 minutes when a worker was mopping the floors and told someone to seat me. Server didn't ask me anything, just put the menus down and left. I had to constantly try to get her attention for water, which the cups were so dirty and food was floating in my water! She seem very distracted and didn't want to work. 

Overall, I know lots of people like this place, but it's a huge no-no for me. If you don't care about the service and food you give to people, don't be in the food or customer service industry. Zero stars if I could've."}
{"text":"Third time going there. So obviously I like the place. But it had been a while. Nice roomy place. And food is pretty good. Their lunch menu is very limiting. I don't remember being charged for sashimi before but now they do. Staff is very helpful. Special items available for additional charge.  Would I go back again-likely."}
{"text":"Very delicious and fresh sushi and excellent grilled teriyaki items.  Lots of choice on the all you cat eat menu.  We had a great meal here, everything was super fresh and tasty. Service was fast and friendly.  I wish it was closer to where I lived, so I could visit more often!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this is probably one of the worst sushi restaurants in Woodbridge. I get that this place is super cheap and I shouldn't have high expectations but damn.. at least make the food decent enough to eat. The quality of the fish was abysmal. It was warm and mushy like it had been marinating under the hot sun for a week. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The service is good, but the food just can not meet the bar."}
{"text":"nothing great about this place.  Had the salmon teriyaki bento box.  The salmon was thin, tasteless and DRY.  I didn't even finish it because it was legit like a piece of dry and hard sandpaper at the end and I ALWAYS finish my food.  Their California rolls are standard.  My table also got some sashimi to start.  I don't eat raw fish but it looked pretty fresh and the pieces were cut quite thick, so that's one plus."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp. So went to ginza sushi for ayce lunch. First of all service is below average. 

Got the paper for ayce and I tick what I wanted to order. Ordered a wonton soup which didn't get the soup. The general Tao chicken is not crispy and not great sauce. Tom yum is too watery. Fry rice is just average fry rice that could be better. This is most of the Thai food. For the sushi part it was ok I mean below ok. 

Not a great place for ayce for sure not sure how this place would survive in this business for so long. Anyway everyone have different taste maybe others like it. 

Could improve more. Thanks"}
{"text":"Their new sushi rolls just got out. Good food, good price. Love going there! Usually very busy during weekend nights. Better call ahead to make reservation."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great. 

We came for dinner and one thing that really caught my eye was a $8 bento box. Whaaat?! The quantity was a lot, especially for the price. The quality was okay. Nothing to write home about. The salmon teriyaki was a bit dry, but the sushi was good."}
{"text":"Eh wasnt blown away by their food
Food is neither too bad nor too good 
Service seemed pretty okay to me idk why other people are talking so badly about the service"}
{"text":"All you can eat lunch menu is pretty limited but if you are a basic sushi lover you'll for sure love this place. 13.99 on weekdays is great as most other places are 16.99 just for lunch, ginza sushi is extremely clean which is what I love. The washrooms are extremely well cleaned and well organized and designed. What I also like about ginza is that you truly are not extremely close to the people beside you which I absolutely hate, so it's actually nice being spaced out. The negatives though, the salmon they gave was literally just a huge clump of it, not really broken up. Overall would recommend!"}
{"text":"Typically come here for take out. Great value for the price! Nothing too jaw-dropping but still satisfies my sushi cravings. The fish is quite fresh and the sushi portions large. 

Take-out service is great. One time I got there and realized they messed up my order over the phone,  however, they threw in two new orders for free plus the mistaken order! I also appreciate how they always throw in free spring rolls with your order!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi restaurants in Woodbridge. They have an AYCE menu that keeps expanding and their take-out a la carte options have me hooked on Udon. The service is quick and the give you free spring rolls with your orders."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite sushi place, but I don't think I am willing to return. It is a pretty place, one of three locations in the GTA. The three stars reflect that the food has always been pretty good, sometimes great, but the past few visits have been frustrating and disappointing in terms of service. Sometimes it's difficult to get someone to even take our orders, or the miso soups arrive after the sushi, or they forgot our drinks ... or one of our dishes. The last few times, it's been like pulling teeth to get the bill ... and to get the credit card processed. 

If you decide to brave this place, I do like the miso soup, seaweed salad, spider roll, deep fried sweet potato roll, spicy tuna roll, and the sushi pizzas. (I haven't tried many of their Thai offerings.) But I'll try one of the other Thornhill sushi places next time I'm craving sushi."}
{"text":"Excellent 12+/10 service. Staff always friendly and quick and efficient service. Whether you come for lunch with coworkers or out for romantic diner with your loved one you will NOT be disappointed. Good quality sushi, very thin layer of rice with lots of sashimi. This is a top favourite place for sushi. Would recommended +++"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Ginza in awhile but I was in the area and just popped in. I've always loved this place. There's that feeling of quality food with that sense of home to it. 

They have a new extended menu. Sometimes I think it's a little too broad since I have a hard time navigating my order. 

I had the Tom Yom soup with shrimp... I think I prefer their hot and sour better. The Tom Yom wasn't spicy enough.

Their green dragon was fresh and fantastic. I love eel so I ordered the black pearl... Wasn't crazy about it. It had a lot of eel and caviar but I found it a little bit tasteless. It needed a kick. Maybe some spicy mayo?

Love their sushi pizzas but today that was more than enough food for me.

Till next time, I hope your bellies are full and taste buds are satisfied."}
{"text":"OMG!!! The wasabi taste like mould. The sashimi is like reserved for a month.  Worst place ever:("}
{"text":"When I heard it was $13 for all you can eat sushi, I was all in. The service is either slow (for absolutely no reason at all), or timely. The food is really good. I was a fan of the sushi pizza; it was worth the wait. My experience with the staff was very nice, and I always leave with a food baby. 

Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Best AYCE in the GTA! Trusttt I've tried all of them. Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"We were craving sushi but were too lazy to travel to our usual restaurant. We decided to give this restaurant a try since it is only a couple blocks from where we were at, and it received decent reviews. As you can see from our rating of this restaurant, it was a pretty disappointing experience. 

We were seated quickly once we stepped into the restaurant, the staff were friendly and smiled. The waitress led us to our table and explained that they have an all you can eat menu and told us of their soft drink promotion. We intended to get a party tray for $30, but decided to do the $15.99 AYCE instead since the cost is around the same and we can actually order what we want to eat (we can be picky) and it also included sashimi, although there were only 3 fish choices. 

The waitress left and we realized we were not served any tea. It wasn't until they came to pick up our order sheet that they poured us hot tea, really hot tea actually.  Before the food came, we took our time to observe the interior a little. It was relatively modern looking and fairly clean...until I noticed cob webs at the corner and oil splatters on the wall. 

The sushi in general had a lot of rice, and the maki rolls were poorly made. The sashimi pieces were also cut into varying thickness...some were big chunks and others were thin. They were breaking apart on their own and did not melt in our mouths. But then again, we chose the AYCE option, we already lost our right to complain about having too much rice in our sushi and unappealing food presentation. But wait, there is a little more:

- The fried salt & pepper calamari were way too salty. It was also missing pepper. So it was more like \"salted fried calamari\" rather than salt & pepper.
-  The philadelphia roll was made with cooked salmon...the same kind of boiled salmon that I ate in my congee the day before.
- The red dragon roll was topped with smoked salmon. It honestly wouldn't be all that bad if they didn't add this salad dressing in the red dragon roll. The tangy salad dressing did not mix with the smoked salmon taste very well. The shrimp tempura in the roll was also obviously old and re-fried as it was very hard and looked extremely stale. 
- and finally, the spicy salmon roll. They use a brand of chinese hot sauce to make it spicy...it is the same chinese hot sauce my family uses for our dumplings. 

We did not receive everything we ordered, which typically happens in AYCE restaurants, except this time we were missing almost half of what we ordered. It took a couple minutes before I successfully caught our waitress' attention as she was too busy chatting with the sushi chefs and we promptly got the rest of our order. Our food came and we soon started wishing we hadn't asked for them as they were just as bad as what we already ate. Everything was extremely disappointing and we were confused how it even got 4 stars on yelp. 

We ate the last bit of food we had and the waitress came and collected all our plates and eating utensils. She then asked us how many scoops of ice cream we wanted. We love green tea ice cream so we asked for 3 scoops each. One of us told her \"3 scoops please\" and the other said \"For me too.\" The waitress returned with 3 scoops of ice cream in one bowl, and 2 scoops of ice cream in another bowl. She handed us 2 plastic spoons, smiled and left. We stared at the 2 scoops of ice cream in the one bowl and just started laughing our head off. At that point we were no longer preoccupied with feeling upset and disappointed; we were plain amused by the fact that \"for me too\" was misinterpreted as \"For me, 2.\" One of the plastic spoons is also chipped off at the front, which we also laughed at.

So good luck. Maybe if you opt for the normal menu the food would be better. But we definitely do not recommend eating AYCE at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Are you ready to order? That question came up 3 times within 10 minutes of being seated at Ginza. Why is our waiter hounding us? Does he not realize that we need a few minutes to figure out our order? Our dinner at Ginza got off to a shaky start and sadly never recovered. 

Ginza specializes in Japanese and Thai food. I recently came here on a Saturday night and was pretty disappointed. I ordered the spicy chicken bento box ($12) which came with spicy chicken, sticky rice, 2 fried dumplings (gyoza), 3 pcs of California roll, 5pcs sushi (2 shrimp 3 salmon) , miso soup and ice cream. For $12 dollars this is definitely a lot of food, sadly quantity has trumped quality at Ginza. The spicy chicken was laughable, dried up pieces of chicken breast served with a red sauce that was more sweet than spicy and tasted a bit like ketchup. The California rolls were tiny and reminiscent of supermarket sushi. The sushi was ok, but the salmon could have been sliced a bit thicker. The gyoza was crispy but once again nothing special. Lastly the miso soup was run of the mill; you can get that quality of miso soup at any Japanese restaurant around. My mango ice cream may have been the best part of the meal. 

My sister ordered a salmon tempura roll in addition to her bento box. The roll was small, didn't have too much going on in the way of flavour and like the California roll can be compared with supermarket quality sushi. 

The restaurant itself was very busy on a Saturday night and I even had to wait a bit for a table. Despite the aggressive start to our service, in the end it was actually quite attentive. Despite the nice service and the decent looking restaurant I will likely not be returning to Ginza since I can probably get an AYCE sushi lunch for the same price without sacrificing much in the way of quality."}
{"text":"We order from this location regularly, for take out! But rarely do we sit and eat inn!
The staff is kind and the women  Who runs here is amazing! ('may')
The prices are very competitive and the food quality is good.fast service.
But I was completely turned off and disappointed with the interior, the seating mostly,  this place is nice and fairly large otherwise. Really starting to show its age. 
My husband really insisted on the all you can eat , they were very accommodating with my 'gluten free sensitivity ' and we're happy to offer options. 
Again, the food tastes good and the quality is good, the service is great. Just the interior is a bit of a  turn off!
And other then then some of our orders being mixed up time to time, we still enjoy returning and dining."}
{"text":"A very affordable AYCE sushi option in the Woodbridge area.  The fish is very fresh and the rolls are quite good.  The ordering system is the old-school paper menu and pencil, but the service is a bit better than some of their nearby competition.  I'd like to see some more creativity in the rolls, however; the red dragon and green dragon rolls are somewhat pedestrian.  All in all I'd go back, but it does make me miss K&B in Oakville."}
{"text":"Good service. Food is above average. Nice restaurant interior. Good take out and lunchtime deals. By far my favourite salmon sushi pizza is from this place!"}
{"text":"So the first thing I noticed when I first walked in was the smell of the place...it had this bleachy smell though my hubby said he couldn't really smell it.  The d√©cor of the place was nice. It was spacious and the booth chairs were comfy.  I applaud  their courage to offer both Japanese and Thai, however I don't think they did a good job at either cuisine, and here's why:

- the pork cutlet with curry sauce Bento ($9.95), with the choice of dynamite roll. The sushi was not crafted with care, I dare say I can make better looking sushi than theirs and I'm not even good at that 
- the pad thai with satay beef - it was the most orangey (colour-wise; see picture) pad thai I have ever seen.  It was way too sweet, and the texture of the noodles was not good. The satay beef was fine though. 
- the mango ice cream that came with the meal was subpar -- we didn't finish it

The redeeming point from this place is their customer service, the 2-3 waitresses who helped us were all courteous and helpful. I don't think I will be coming back to this place.  So one star for the food, and the other star for the service."}
{"text":"I've generally never been disappointed with this place but my last experience has me questioning if I would go back (refer to final paragraph).

I came on a Sunday prior to opening. They were closed and all of the employees were having a smoke break just before they opened the doors.

Once the doors opened, I sat down and was handed their AYCE menu.

I gave them some time to set up and they came by to take my order when they were ready.

The food items for lunch AYCE was pretty decent and it good but nothing that stood out.

It wasn't until I ordered round two that I became concerned.

One of the waiters rolled out an anti-slip mat leading from the kitchen to part of the dining area onto the floor. Right after he finished, he reappeared with a couple of plates of my food. I still ate the food but had I been smarter, I would have asked him to get me a new one and made sure that he washed his hands. It's based on this experience that will likely prevent me from going back."}
{"text":"Sushi tasted delicious and was really well made compared to other sushi restaurants. Very modern decor and relaxing ambiance. Service was accommodating."}
{"text":"I'm happy for Ginza to be my 100th review! 

This is my favourite sushi place! The service is excellent - very attentive and quick. The sushi rolls have a perfect balance of rice and filling; they don't put excessive rice like many other places do. Their salmon sashimi is delicious! Be sure to ask for a side of spicy mayo for dipping (everything) in! 

Go-to items:
- Salmon sashimi
- Salmon rose
- Spicy salmon pizza
- Spicy California roll
- Spicy salmon roll
- Squid tempura

$24.99 for weekday dinner, $26.99 for weekend/holiday dinner."}
{"text":"The food is affordable and delicious, fast-served. If you are there, you should try Beef short ribs and Eel Dragon roll. Staff is friendly and can offer ice cream for free. Benta box is nice choice for lunch and will cost no more than 15$. Decor is nice and calm color-choice  makes it even better. Great place to have all-you-can eat dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Ordered for pick up and was told 20 minutes, ended up waiting taking more than 50 minutes. The staff were so rude and looked at the customers like they were in the wrong. If you're busy, you're busy but you as a restaurant/business knows that, set realistic expectations for them. If we were told 40 minutes we would have either ordered somewhere else or taken our time and not have to stand, waiting around for more than half an hour. Unacceptable and completely unprofessional. Food was mediocre that it made the wait even more infuriating. Because it was so busy, that could have been reflected in the food quality or either that, it just wasn't good to begin with. Would not return and definitely would not recommend at all. Even people eating in the restaurant looked pissed off and unimpressed, and they got their food in a somewhat timely manner! Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 2.5 stars.
The food was really good and the service was also good. There were some things however, about the dining experience that definitely rubbed me the wrong way.
When we sat down, some of our dishes were dirty. They were quickly replaced upon letting our server know, so that wasn't a big deal.
When our crab sashimi came, there were bits of plastic packaging on it! I'm pretty sure I injested some and so did my friend (I felt like it was karma because fish injest plastic all the time in our polluted oceans lol, how unpleasant!).
Another thing which REALLY irked me was when I ordered a beer, she poured it in the glass by basically tipping it vertically upside down. There was so much head in my beer and it was flat by the time it settled! DO NOT LET THEM POUR YOUR BEER!
Those were my issues with this place.
It was $19 for all you can eat and when you pay cash (which I did), there is a 15% discount.
The food was good but I'm not eager to go back here. Stay away from the crab sashimi and don't let them pour your beer."}
{"text":"They are no longer a Sushi bar... Just order by menu. That said, the renovation has made the place look amazing, and the sushi chef is the same. FRESH sushi for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I must say i do like the food a lot. I always get the spicy tuna roll in every sushi restaurant that i go and Ginza's is my favorite. Their sushi pizzas are also my favorite. The service is not the best however. We constantly have to look for the waiters to order, get things and pay and so on. I also find the prices very reasonable. 

Food: 4.5/5
Service: 3/5
Price: 4.5/5
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Tempura had obviously been sitting out, \"BBQ eel\" made in a toaster oven, and overcooked sour rice. I used to come to Ginza often because it had impressive, fresh sushi. Tonight I went for the first time in a month or two and it was so utterly disappointing I left early from my dinner  and don't intend on ever going back. Total degenerate of a restaurant. 

The food was not fresh and the rice was so sub standard. Luckily our waiter was attentive, but when we mentioned that the meal was disappointing he said he would send the manager who never showed up and continued on making spicy mayo in the back. Cowardly management who knows better but is clearly greedy and unconcerned for the people paying his bills. Thanks Ginza. You used to be a great place. Tonight I finished my meal at the sushi restaurant across the street which actually impressed me and was worthwhile."}
{"text":"The sushi here is amazing, I've been a regular customer and the sushi always seems to amaze me. The crab salad rice rolls are to die for and the kitchen food are amazing and fresh. The staff are also friendly and understanding."}
{"text":"I am a huge sushi lover and Ginza is my local sushi stop when I am craving my spicy tuna and red dragon rolls but do not wish to travel across the city.

This restaurant offers a large menu with tons of sushi, great appetizers and various bento box options.

And the green tea is delicious and unlimited, so enjoy drinking a ton as you eat.

Here are my favourites at this place:

- Shrimp Tempura (HUGE Shrimps with a nice crispy finish)
- Red Dragon (This roll is wrapped up in delicious smoked salmon)
- Green Dragon (a delicious combo of shrimp, crab and veggies wrapped up in fresh green avocado)
- Golden California Rolls (Not as healthy but it is fried to perfection and melts in your mouth)
- Chicken Teriyaki bento box (tons of food! Chicken, veggies, rice, 6 pieces of sushi, and dessert)


Overall, Ginza is cheap, yummy and close to anyone who lives far north in Toronto.

As well, they have a location at Yonge and Clark in Thornhill."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, which is the only time they have AYCE... come on guys, you know this. I don't mess with a la carte and a la carte don't mess with me. They had a very small selection but the pluses were:

- very little rice in the maki - yum
- dynamite rolls sooo fweeesh
- coconut shrimp GET IN MY BELLY
- deep fried squid, you sexy beast.
- spicy salmon maki with sauce SQUISHED in between two salmons INSIDE the maki. !?!?!?
- pop included in price
- fast service, nice service

would defo come back!"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning last time we ordered sushi. That's a shame because it's been one of my favourite places for such a long time, but the quality of their food seems to have gone downhill."}
{"text":"Never tried AYCE but tried their lunch menu. Sushi always taste fresh and service and fast and courteous. Great prices during lunch hours as well as you can get the whole meal for under $10.
They have delivery and takeout options as well"}
{"text":"Hmmm...I had different experience as to the lunch and dinner.

I tried the dinner first 3 months ago.  The place was so packed even on a weeknight but the service was still fast and attentive.  The toro sashimi was good, but honestly I am so missing those fresh toro I ate in Japan!!

Yesterday, I went back and tried their lunch with my family at around 1:30pm.  Food is still up to standard but the service was horribly slow.  Totally different senario!

Yet I gave 4 stars to the dinner but 3 starts to the lunch!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Ginza Finch and Ginza Thornhill for the past 12 years at least.  This place has never let me down when it comes to sushi or non sushi items.  The quality is fresh, the rolls are innovative.  The product is not too overpriced and now due to their resounding success, the owners have renovated both locations and opened a third at Bay and Bloor and made all the spaces super funky and modern with fusica and white.  

While you should go for the sushi, the ramen or soba noodle soups are great too."}
{"text":"This place is pretty spacious and has been updated with a modern interior. They offer a lunch special menu with smaller lunches starting at $7 going up to about $11 for the black cod bento box. They also have a decent AYCE selection for $14. Oddly enough, although advertised as a Japanese restaurant this place is going through somewhat of an identity crisis. A smiling buddha greets you at the front with the usual arsenal of waving Asian cats. They offer dim sum and Thai dishes? 

The service was very friendly but BOY they were s.l.o.w... Miso soup arrived hot coupled by a respectable salad. A nice sized udon arrived shortly after with nice chewy noodles, a sweet broth, and a side plate of crispy (2 shrimp, 4 veg) tempura. Good value for $7.

2 Salmon bento boxes ($10 each) arrived next, each with salad, and steamed rice...ok I don't eat plain rice but still. Each box came with your choice of one 6pc roll. We had the dynamite roll (which was pathetic) but although nearly pureed at least the avocado was ripe and the tiny shrimp tempura in the center was still crunchy. The other roll was their version of the spicy salmon which was ok because of an unexpected touch of garlic but overall not great...perhaps they had an amateur sushi chef today? The teriyaki salmon was large but I found it bland and a bit dry as it was served nearly teriyaki free, and didn't come with any steamed or stir fried veg :(

As a testament to their service issues, the hwae dop bop arrived last. Sashimi is supposed to be the appetizer. The slices were decent in size and moderately fresh cuts (3 salmon, 2 tuna, 2 butterfish). 

Everything came to ~$38 + tip. I saw an older sushi chef behind the bar so I'm guessing he is the one that made the special rolls that I saw which looked big and badass. The young guy may as well have been blind.

Maybe their Thai food is made well? I don't really care to find out though, this experience was just ok."}
{"text":"Just edible.
The salmon in my roll was tough and oddly cut.
The other rolls were just decent.
The salad was horrible (gross oily dressing)
The House Udon was like a mismash of kitchen scraps sauteed with noodles."}
{"text":"Have only tried takeout from here, but I like it! Look forward to trying the all you can eat menu one day. Love salmon sashimi! Yum!"}
{"text":"We have now visited Ginza on several occasions. I, therefore, have the benefit of multiple meals to compare. Their price, $28.95 on weekends, is not a bargain so weigh carefully as to how much you're going to eat. Keeping in mind that if one person chooses \"all you can eat\" the whole table must do so. On the other hand, if you have a growing teenager whose adopted middle name is hangry then \"all you can eat\" makes perfect economical sense. 
Like any other establishment, there are strong and weak points to their menu. Japanese staples like Miso and Seaweed salad are solid. Whereas more exotic items like; Saba (Mackerel) and butterfish aren't consistently fresh. Other strengths include their torched Salmon and Snapper.  The slight heating on the edge of each piece of Sashimi adds a hint of BBQ flavour while still maintaining Sushi's expected texture. 
Unlike some other \"all you can eat\" Sushi restaurants, service here is warm and attentive. With both our water glasses and tea mugs replenished regularly. As well as accommodating our request to have only sweet potato in our tempura order. Like other establishments, Ginza's\"all you can eat\"  menu warns of a $1 charge for any leftover food. So order accordingly or in stages to prevent that from happening.    
You and your guests will be presented with the A la Carte Menu upon your arrival. As not all items in the a la carte menu are available if you choose the \"all you can eat \" option ask for the latter menu. Compare and decide which option you are going ahead with. Then enjoy a competently prepared meal in a pleasant milieu."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had. First the food quality was mediocre at best. But worst was the service. As an all u can eat meal, you place your order on a 'sushi menu.'  We did. There were 6 of us, including 3 kids. The we waited, and waited and waited. Food begin to trickle in from the order. The kids were hungry and naturally impatient. It never all came, so we reordered and waited and waited. 2 hrs later we had enough - of waiting that is. Maybe half the food we'd expected had come. We complained and the \"comped\" is one adult meal. We complained and they comped us one kids meal. Enough. Let's get out- and we did. Never, ever to return. I'll have to say, the folks adjacent to us, with 2 kids, had a marginally better experience - but told us about much better sushi options in the neighborhood. 

Prospective customers - be warned."}
{"text":"Overall, the food there is below average, even worse than sushi and hot dishes that you can buy take out from those Asian grocery stores. 

I ordered a bento box at dinner including sushi and rolls, miso soup and salad with a choice of hot dish-I tried the spicy chicken thought it shouldn't be a problem as it's quite a normal easiest dish. 

Food came out quickly but I realized the spicy chicken was not I expected. It's just boiled chicken, no marinade, I mean... boiled tasteless chicken?! To my surprise, they put hot sauce on top and that was it.... this is no skill at all! Kids can even cook better than this to be honest. Boiled chicken + hot sauce.... well there was also a little bit of black pepper... so you think this was marinaded?? Why would I pay $15 for a tasteless dish? No wonder the food came out very quickly!!!

Told one of the waitresses about this issue and got this funny reply: don't treat this as an authentic Japanese food as we mainly target to those 'whites' (gwai lo - Cantonese meaning of white people). And she told me to 1. Pack this home 2. Marinade 3. Cook your own 4. Use teriyaki sauce to serve given by her

I have never encountered this type of customer service. And she was very honest about the quality of food at this restaurant."}
{"text":"It used to be an ok place, but now it became a decent place for people looking for all u can eat cheap sushi.
Service is horrible. You feel like they're doing you a favour. When you order a la carte sushi you get small pieces like the ones you get at all you can eat.
I give 2 stars only because they do have a few dishes that are really good. 
Overall it's ok for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"when we used to live in north york we came here quite a lot. services are ok, i am really expecting super great services as long as they are not rude i am fine with it.
food came out fast, rolls are good. selection are fine. i like all their rolls. 
if u paid cash you get 15% off.
if i was still living close there that will be my spot. only i wish them have a lit more special rolls."}
{"text":"Grabbing a quick lunch on the go today for me. Ginza service is inconsistent, but I like that most of their food is properly bite sized and that you can get raw scallop here. Takeout is generally fast.  

Multiple washrooms make this a decent spot for a family meal."}
{"text":"I didn't see much in terms of variety in this place, so I ordered with what I saw.

I went for the lunch specials, and I must say they're not that bad. The miso soup was a bit salty though, and my grandparents did complain about that.
The sashimi was quite fresh, I admit. Wish the pieces were bigger though, it isn't exactly worth the $15+ I spent."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We came in on a Friday night and there were two tables open. We waited for four  minutes before a server could acknowledge us and when she did, she said she would look for a table and never came back. One minute later another person came and did the same thing. Then another couple walked in and they were seated right away. When they did finally seat us they did not serve us for another five minutes then moved us to another table. When we finally did get a table and food they gave us sushi that looked a day old. Not to mention, when we ordered our sushi they missed half our order and we had to place another order. They have no kind of system in place and the servers are scattered and know nothing about good customer service. Do not come here, you're better off making the drive elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here this past weekend. The inside of the restaurant is very clean and inviting.  We had the sushi combo for 2. A good amount of food and the sashimi slices were a fair size. The dragon rolls were huge; I would suggest downsizing on the amount of cucumber and rice to make the rolls more manageable :) Raw fish items tasted fresh and our dragon roll was great (other than the massive size). We ended our meal with tempura sesame ice cream, which was more than enough for two people to share. Our server was prompt but not very friendly. I would come back here again for the food."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vaughan!! Always come here for their AYCE menu for lunch and dinner. Their lunch prices are $13 and dinner is around $19. Worth it though because of their great service and fresh sushi."}
{"text":"All I can say about it \"It's OKay\".. nothing special. Price is actually cheap for sushi..Love the Idea of giving you a can Pop as refill \"at least you know its really lol nothing add to it\" .."}
{"text":"I came here in group of 5 or 6 for a coupon deal that I got. The coupon told us to make reservations before going which we did. When we got to the restaurant we had to wait for an incredibly long time before we got a seat.

Was the long wait worth it? Well, the food was good but it's not amazingly better than other a la carte or AYCE sushi places that I've been to. The service was great though but I got a feeling it was to compensate for the long wait we had to get a seat even with reservations.

If you live near a Ginza, go check it out, just not during dinner rush hour!"}
{"text":"Despite the name, does both Japanese and Thai food, and well.
Sushi is of decent quality- both the fish and the rice- and is comparatively reasonable.
Pad Thai didn't quite taste right, but has been the only thing on the menu that wasn't excellent. Entree servings are on the larger side and definitely reasonably priced.

Service is average, both in attentiveness and speed. Wait staff is impersonal but effective. Can have a line up at peak times (lunch and dinner on weekends) which can be problematic and make the space seem crowded - I don't know many people who enjoy being stood over and stared at while eating - without a proper place to wait. Otherwise, the space is comfortable and frequently noisy."}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday lunch with a couple of friends and I have to say that it's pretty good overall though I didn't order the AYCE aspect of it but just simply a la carte.

Service:
It's a touch above average.  They're pretty attentive and they go around to ensure that your order has been taken, and while they come a bit like they're in a rush, they do their job decently.  Even when one of my friends ordered something and while everyone else had their food, the head waitress came by to tell my friend that his food was coming real soon, and it did (no more than 3 minutes).

Environment:
Area's pretty clean and I just personally love the contemporary feel that Japanese restaurants are becoming.  

Food:
So I ordered the Chirashi-Don and it costed $10 and I feel that it's very reasonably priced.  Portion-wise, it's pretty big, and a nice amount of Sashimi ranging from mackerel, to salmon, to tamago (Japanese Egg).  Overall, the sashimi is fresh and the cuts are pretty beautiful.  Also, the rice has a slight tartness from the sushi vinegar, which is very reassuring because normally a lot places just plop rice in a bowl and serve sashimi on top of it.  Overall, it's a well-put together dish.

My friend ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, and that dish I have to admit from what I tasted was somewhat disappointing.  My friend counted at most 5-6 little pieces of chicken in the dish while it was predominantly just the noodles, with a few pieces of vegetables.  Visually, it look very saucy and wet and when I tasted it, it didn't have a whole lot of intensity (in other words, borderline bland).  Just not a good dish, and my friend was visibly not enjoying his dish.

Overall, it's a nice place to go but I would just be cautious with their Thai dishes."}

{"text":"I've been to a variety of sushi places across Toronto and none of them have been as consistent as the quality of food at Ginza (especially at to Yonge and Clark location).

I used to go to the All-You-Can-Eat sushi locations nearby (Hockey Sushi and Sushi Fun), but I've gotten sick on numerous occasions and refuse to go to both again. 

The service isn't always there but the quality for sure is. I tend to expand what I eat there. I highly recommend the Cod Fish Bento Box and the Golden California Roll.

My fiancee and I have locked that place down as a staple when we don't know where to eat (which is often) because It's great food with a great atmosphere and definitely worth a look at."}
{"text":"Food is always great. Customer Service is meh. The restaurant itself is awesome. 
Delivery tho? The food swear it has come from somewhere else. Wouldnt doubt if this food was frozen off to the side waiting to be delivered. The woman who takes the order hardly speaks English. I get it, its your culture and all. But if your going to speak to those who only understand English you'd at the least try to improve how you speak. 

Giving it 3 for the food, and the restaurant itself. All else fails"}
{"text":"I occasionally order sushi here for dinner (takeout). I've always ordred the GS5 which consists of 18 rolls (u will be STUFFED)  & comes with soup/salad. Today I decided to be adventurous & ordered the philadelphia roll, kamakachi roll, Ginza roll (came to about $22.10 after 10% discount cuz i paid in cash). I enjoyed the philly rolls the best. The others were a bit messy although still alright ... though I first questioned the freshness of the Kamakachi. Ginza rolls were HUGE & they kinda ruined it by squishing 2/8 rolls down (did I mention they were pretty expensive? about $12?) & putting in the wasabi & ginger crap on top of my rolls (please see pic)... Should've told them to omit it. Perhaps next time...Oh.. & I found a short piece of hair on one of my rolls (praying it's not pubic hair)....@@ 

They've renovated the place & it looks very chic mod now. But perhaps the experience would be better had I eaten there at the restaurant instead of takeout. Prices have gone up ... but still frugalish. Not too impressed this time..."}
{"text":"This place used to have a decent sushi AYCE. However, I came here for lunch and there was way too much rice on the sushi with very little fillings. For whatever odd reason, all of them tasted so sweet, most likely from the seaweed. I'm assuming that the sushi was not fresh at all. 
The service was slow, waited for about 20 minutes for the first round and it wasn't even busy. We were not even offered wasabi and ginger. The waiters were friendly though, so I appreciate that. Overall, the best thing I had from here was the canned root beer...add ice for an extra kick."}
{"text":"I take all my compliments back today!! 2.5 stars for the same portion size and sashimi quality.

Their fried ice-cream and coconut pudding were bad! Especially the pudding, it tastes bland. I couldn't finish it after the first spoon.

The service was terrible. First, please smile when I, or any other customers, said \"Thank you\" to you when you served us food. We are your customers and we pay for the food, not like we begged you for free food and service!

Yes, we got 15% off paying by cash. My sister was going thru her waller for more change for tips. The waitress was waiting at the table, and my sister felt awkward so she asked asked the waitress to take the money we put on the tray first ($2 extra was on the tray). The waitress literally counted the money right in front of us which was really rude. Then she required us to put down at least 10% tips, which was even ruder, and after that she walked away. My sister was so mad, so instead of putting down another $5 for tips she left on the bill tray, she left on table only $2 more (the bill was $70 and I think it was very generous to give her $4 tips with such attitude). Did I mention that she constantly looked back at us after she left to see if we would give her more tips?

We swore we will never to go back here again with such attitude from the waitress. This is not how you do customer service okay? You could have asked \"is there something wrong with our service?\" or \"how do you like our service?\" 

It wasn't because we were cheap that we didn't want to give you the tips, it was your attitude. 

Just very rude!"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that I live about a five minute walk from this place, and used to go here all the time. By all the time, I mean at least once a week. I used to love this place, the service, the food, met the owner a few times. This all changed when I got served a little extra with my meal. As the server put down the platter of sushi on our table, a half living cockroach was dropped onto our table next to it. It fell from the bottom of the plate right onto the table. We were completely horrified and revolted (as you could imagine). Not only was I disturbed that the cockroach was still alive (pointing to the fact that there must be many more), but when we let our server know, his reaction was underwhelming. He came and swiped the roach with his towel, laughed about it, and began to walk away. I let him know I cannot eat the food that was a served with the roach and would just like to leave, he offered me a 10% discount instead. Yes, I would love cockroach infested sushi for a 10% discount please. The reaction of the server is what tells me there are many of these little guys roaming in the back of house. I wonder when they had their last inspection. Now I keep away at all costs."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to update my review for this restaurant for a little while. Now although I haven't eaten inside the restaurant in forever, I've ordered take-out quite a bit from here since my first review. 

They have really good combination platters that you can order for takeout (not sure if they're available for ordering inside the restaurant). The options are big and affordable. Though I have fallen in love with other sushi restaurants, my mom absolutely loves ordering sushi from Ginza. Great thing about them is that they deliver. I remember calling numerous places later in the evening and they wouldn't deliver, whereas Ginza always seems to come through."}
{"text":"The service here is fantastic!

The place is designed with pink detailings which is perfect for ladies night out. The location is the only downside as it is in a dingy looking plaza at Bayview and Finch with not much to offer.

I always order the Moscow roll. Very good. Fried goodness on the outside with a mix of raw fish in the roll topped with spicy sauce. 

They now also serve AYCE menu which I have yet to try, but their welcoming service always make me feel at home even if I just order take-out. They really are more into quality than quantity, as the rolls are on the pricier side.
I`m not to sure if their AYCE menu will be served under the same standard though."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ginza for years now. Initially we started going there because of it's close proximity to my parents' place, but we keep going back because the food never disappoints! 

The restaurant is clean and well maintained (they renovated it about a year ago and it looks great!). The staff are also very friendly and informative. 

I often go and order food for takeout, but they are still very hospitable. They always offer us a table and serve us green tea while we wait for our order to be ready. 

They have several innovative types of sushi rolls that will ensure you'll never tire of the selection. The fish is always fresh and delicious! I especially love their miso soup in comparison to other sushi restaurants. It's not overly salty and has lots of tofu and seaweed. 

I also appreciate that their edamame is reasonably priced. I've been outraged that other establishments are charging upwards of $4 for edamame. Ginza's is only $2.95 and they give you quite a fair bit. 

This location is my favourite, but I've been to the one on Bay a few times as well. It's good, but doesn't have the same feel as well as the North York one."}
{"text":"Me and my friends have spent many days at Ginza in Woodbridge over the past few years. For the price and amount of food you can consume, along with the great quality of food and service, it's a no brainer for any time of the week...or weekend. 

My personal favourites what i would recommend trying are the Cocount Shrimp, Spicy Salmon Rolls, Chicken Cutlet, and you can't go wrong with anything Tempura. 

All in all a great place for lunch or dinner. Lunch will run you about $15, and Dinner about $25. 

Actually i'll be going back again this weekend for the 100th time. If your in the Vaughan area and looking for a new place to try for a great meal, stop in you won't regret it.

I would give dinner a try first before lunch for your first time as there are a lot more menu items"}
{"text":"Service (1/5): We didn't have a reservation, and we were seated right away, which was nice, but we were seated by the window, which got colder and colder every time someone opened the door. We ordered from the AYCE menu and 50% of the things we ordered didn't come. We inquired about this, and were instructed by our server to re-order the food that we didn't receive. We asked her what happened and she said she didn't know. Clearly there is a communication barrier with some of the staff, but this varies server to server. Also we waited around 40 mins in between when the sushi was served to when the cooked foods arrived. Also, I had to ask several times before receiving the bill. 

Food (3/5): Most of the food was lovely. The sushi was delicate, and rolled tight. I like the size of the rolled sushi. Smaller than the average sushi restaurant, making it easier to handle and eat. The beef teriyaki was dry and chewy. There was a hair in the green tea ice cream. 

Ambiance (3/5): The actual restaurant looks beautiful. Very modern feel with dark woods and bamboo accents. There is a peaceful sound of a rock waterfall as you enter the restaurant. The bathroom was atrocious. Very small, smelled of urine, and not well kept. I felt dirtier leaving the bathroom than entering.

Overall (2/5): I've been to this place several times because the lack of service I can usually accept for fantastic food, but given the previously mentioned points, I will not return when Kyoto 88 is right down the street."}
{"text":"I have to feel as though the people that complain about this place are uptight horrible people. 

I like it very much.  I think their rolls are very good. Theres some stuff thats very miss, like their Salmon Rose looks like it was put together by a 2 year old. But other than that, I think its a good option with lots of space to sit."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer here for years, before it renovated and became a chain, and I can honestly say that it's still my favourite Japanese restaurant. The interior is absolutely beautiful, with classy lighting and decor. This place has a really nice cozy, upscale ambience without having to resort to high prices. The servers are very attentive and friendly (+1 for speaking fluent Cantonese and English!).

The best part, though, is the food! Although some people might have reservations about eating raw fish (sashimi), there's nothing to worry about here; the sashimi is consistently very high quality and impeccably cleaned. I'd say that most of the Japanese items on their menu are pretty much safe choices -- you'll want to try their udon and sashimi. I've only tried a couple of Thai dishes from their menu, and though they aren't as good as their Japanese ones, they are still above average and worth trying."}
{"text":"I haven't done the AYCE but I frequent the take out.
15 minutes, and I have my 3 Ginza Specials
Price is a small percentage cheaper vs the other guys.
But what I love about Ginza is they put the salad sauce/dressing on the side.
The rice in its own bowl.
Everything stays fresh, not soggy and doesn't lose its flavour.
And they always toss in a freebie edamame(sp) , spring rolls, never done $100 order but that must get you something super nice. 
Only place a pinch better for take out would be sushi on bloor and only because their prices are ridiculously low!
Ciao for now"}
{"text":"I am new to the area and some friend dragged me hear and I must say what I had was super.  They have a nice variety of take out food and a nice all you can eat menu that makes me drool just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!!! Worst sushi I have had in years. Was sick all day afterwards. Selection is also terrible for the price you pay. No tempura and limited sushi rolls. I know quality isn't what you look for in all you can eat but this was just awful. Most of the rolls smelled rotten."}
{"text":"The reviews are mixed but in my opinion the place is nice . All you can eat dinner Is 25.99 . Tataki are good! Deep fried cheese cake is amazing. Philadelphia roll has smoked Salmon - it is wrong :)"}
{"text":"Love this place, always come here. It's personally my favourite place in Woodbridge! Food is fresh and service is great!"}
{"text":"All you can eat for $14 lunch. Good portions an surprisingly fresh. Nice to see they include salmon sashimi on their all you can eat menu. Service was great."}
{"text":"Sushi is pretty good and the service is great, much better than other sushi places I have been to in the area. Also very affordable and the quality makes it worth every penny."}
{"text":"My favorite ever! 
I had my first sushi here, have my favorite dish here (Salmon sushi pizza) and always visit here at lease twice when in town. I'm shocked to see people reviewing this place poorly... I remember the service being decent, the fish always being very fresh and the rolls being DELICIOUS. The friends I bring here always impressed as well. This place has grown so much the last 10 or so years... I can't wait to swing by and try it again!

I'd say try their sushi pizzas. I have never had a place cook them better... and I've tried a lot of sushi pizzas! Also -- go for the eel eggrolls! :)"}
{"text":"I remember coming here in 2009 and liking the place. So, I decided to come back again after many years and was a bit disappointed.
 The service is alright, but the food did not meet my expectations of a good sushi. I would rate this place as below average.
The AYCE menu is very limited. There are only about 10 rolls listen and there's no Shrimp Tempura. If you want variety, this is not a good place for AYCE options. The Philadelphia roll was very odd. The rolls are not well prepared and they don't appeal much. 
The only positives I can comment on are the cleanliness of the place and that's about it."}
{"text":"This place use to be so much better, I dunno what happened, maybe new management. the sushi here is still very good but the last 3 times I've been here they didn't even serve most the stuff i ordered, we even ask if we had any more coming and they said yea but even after waiting 15 minutes it never came so we jus asked for the bill and left. I don't think I will be coming back, there are much better sushi places in the area"}
{"text":"I'm having a lot of sushi experiences since I came to Toronto, cause some of my friends just love it, and fortunately I'm having a good time always and Ginza Sushi wasn't different.

The place is really pretty and clean, the girls were talking a lot about the table that we got, that had a nice style, and one funny detail was the background music playing everything, even Brazilian songs hehe (just an info I'm Brazilian...). The down part is the washroom which is so small.

The menu had a lot of options, nothing special or different from regular sushi places, and the price of it was the good part. The daily specials are a good and cheap choice. I had a Bento box with shrimp & vegetables tempura, for $6.99 + tax & tip.

They don't offer a all-you-can-eat, so if your looking for a place to get reeeeally satisfied I wouldn't go there, but there is a good quality if that's what your looking for.

Cheers and have fun!

{"text":"In high school, this was my favourite sushi place.  Their salmon sushi pizza was one of my go to dishes.  Now, they have expanded their menu and offer Thai food as well.  Over the years, I've started to go to the more all you can eat place.  But for a la carte sushi, it's pretty good and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"An okay sushi restaurant. The service is typical of sushi restaurants - the standard give your order, get the order and some water refills. Our waitress was really nice though. We ordered too much and agreed to take the extra charge to take the remaining sushi home and she charged us pretty little despite the quantity we had left. I would stay away from the deep fried foods - the tempura batter is quite thick so it fills you up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"My favourite, go-to sushi place in Woodbridge. Great service and friendly staff. The restaurant and facilities are clean and well-maintained. They offer take-out and delivery service within the area as well.

I frequent this place during lunch hours for either their bento boxes or all-you-can-eat lunch menu. Large portion sizes for their bento boxes. Good variety of items for their all-you-can eat.

During their dinner hours, they have an amazing selection of sashimi in addition to their regular dinner menu items. They also have bento box combos for dinner."}
{"text":"Not bad, but there's definitely better sushi in Toronto.  The convenience of this location is good if you live in Thornhill, and the service is friendly and fast.  The sushi was average at best..."}
{"text":"If I pay $6.95 for a Chirashi with miso soup, I should just shut up and eat?

Salmon, Tuna, White Fish, Crab, Surf Clam sounded OK?

Shari Rice was poorly done but $7??

Services was decent, food came fast.. and they accept AMEX too?

Ginza Sushi is decently good for that price... and I am not complaining... of course there are other options..but if you are looking for a good, cheap lunch special when you have craving for sushi like me.. then just enjoy!

BTW, seems like no one is ordering any of their Thai food item all these time I was there...I guess it is safe to stick with their Japanese selections.

A lot of female eating alone during lunch hour... including me! :P"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last 30 days, once for lunch and once for dinner. 
Both visits were flawless. We were seated right away and offered something to drink. Our orders were taken in a timely manner and the food was brought very quick. Everything was very tasty and fresh. And it is very reasonably priced. I fell in love with the General Tao Chicken - the sauce on the chicken was really good. Their maki rolls were well made and fresh. And the deep fried banana was very tasty. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A great sushi place!
I managed to gorge myself on sushi and the final tab was not much at all.

The wait staff was very polite and attentive, and the food came to the table in no time.
The place gets really busy after 7pm, so it's a good idea to get reservations or get there a little early."}
{"text":"A local spot for me.  Always consistent with the food and good value and quality.  The all you can eat has a pretty big selection.  There is a lunch special menu with a good variety to choose from with very reasonable prices.  Take out is available and very quickly made.  The atmosphere is casual and always a seat even when busy...I've never had to wait."}
{"text":"I ordered handroll set and foods are okay while I was eating. Hand roll set has three hand rolls. First one has avocado, second one has tempura and the third one has salmon with the sauce in it. Tempura was pretty dry and the sauce with salmon was so creamy. It literally tastes like dairy cream with spicy pepper.... Once I finished the dish, I had nausea.... I always had nausea whenever I eat too creamy or too greasy foods.. 

I payed 10$ for this dish and I didn't enjoy the meal... some people are saying it is a cheap place well I don't think so... I doesn't worth the money



Also, the another problem of this place is staffs are not nice. Two people were approaching to us alternatively and both of them were asking whether you r ready or not.. and then one staff came she said\" r u okay\" so I said yes and she tries to get the order so I said \"we need few minutes\" and she was laughing and said \"you said u r ready\" so I was very confused Also I've never seen the staff who takes my dishes right after I finished it... it was very uncomfortable for me.. While we are eating, they kept staring at us to see when they should take dishes... Also, the other staff didn't even say anything and just smiling and walked away.

I wouldn't come back to this place NOT GOOD FOOD AND WEIRD SERVICE"}
{"text":"AYCE buffet that really knows how to give their customer the AYCE experience. I went here last week with a girl friend of mine who has been raving about this place since the day i met her. We love our sushi (Canadian Style) and when we have a craving we always know to ask one another. The other day we decided to hit up this place for some dinner. We ordered a tone of food and enjoyed everything we ordered. I really liked the chicken sushi pizza, the kung pow chicken, The coconut shrimp and of course the actual sushi roles. The roles were a great size and filled with tones of filling. The food came out at a pretty decent speed and at one point we started to fall behind. I really liked the lay out of the dishes as they came to our table. The didn't look as if they were just thrown on a plate. 

The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming. We got a booth in the room off of the main room and it was nice to be in our own little world. Couldn't really hear any of the other tables and it was nice to have some girl to girl catch up time without the feeling of someone listening in. The service was quick and effective. We asked for some spicy mayo and hot sauce and it was nice to have it arrive right away rather then having to ask a bunch of times. I always order water with lemon and it was nice they got this right without me having to ask a second time. Usually places forget to give the lemon. My friend also saved money because she paid with cash, they discount the order when you pay cash where as i paid debit. It still was considerable cheap without the discount. 

All in all excellent experience and I will definitely make the trip up here with my girls the next time we all want to go for sushi."}
{"text":"My favourite AYCE sushi restaurant and that's saying a lot since I eat a lot of sushi, errwhere. They've recently added items to their AYCE menu that expand past sushi and teriyaki dishes. I say at $25 a person (taxes + tip included/weekday) is a pretty decent for the quality of food. Sashimi is always fresh. Service is mediocre but I've had way worst at other Chinese owned restaurants. 

Tip: Pay cash and you got 10% off the bill."}
{"text":"Literally been going to this place every week since I was 8 years old (I'm 16 now). Either way, while the food may not be what you expect it to be in regards to quality, it actually tasted amazing and never ceased to keep me coming back for more. This restaurant has had its ups and downs, but I tell you, right now is as good as ever to go here, definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"I remember coming here a lot in 2002-2010. The sushi was always fresh and yummy. The sushi isn't the same now. I called to place a pick up order and was told it would be ready in 15. When I came to pick it up, they had me pay and the chef hasn't even started to make my order. He was making  other orders, while I glanced at him and kept waiting. I found that annoying. They could have told me to come and pick up my order in 40 minutes. Moreover, the staff constantly talks in their own language, which is thought was a bit rude in front of customers. 
Finally, when I came home, I was excited to try the sushi, which I found to be kinda meh. The avocado in the sushi wasn't cut evenly and one piece was mostly avocado with rice. It showed that it was made in a hurry to get it to me and for me to leave. Plus, I asked for spicy mayo and didn't get any but soy sauce. Don't see myself coming back to Ginza in the future. Not worth the $!! There are others lots of great sushi places to choose from around!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this but I had to lower my rating. I came here yesterday with a friend for lunch. As I mentioned before the GS5 is my favourite combo because it's 3 rolls and they're all delicious- California, dynamite and kamakazi (salmon) I noticed yesterday how tiny these rolls are. The dynamite was especially disappointing because they're small rolls and dynamite rolls are typically a little bigger. There also was barely any shrimp. Also with the California rolls, barely any crab!

Also on a side note our waitress was so dull and unfriendly. Didn't smile once and rushed through our order.

Although it's very tasty still I just found I didn't get my money's worth! If you want a better bang for your buck with some non all you can eat sushi Id suggest Ari Ake near peomenade or sushi bong just a little south of yonge and finch!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Dynamite Roll ever, at the best sushi spot in Vaughan! I've done AYCE here a couple of times - quality of food is great, atmosphere is classy, and there's good service. I've also ordered takeout multiple times too - I order ahead of time and it's always ready by the time I arrive. During lunch hours, when I order a sushi roll, i get complimentary miso soup, spring rolls and green salad! 

P.S. you get 15% off takeout if you pay by cash!"}
{"text":"Great place, I really like a lot of their dishes/rolls.   Been going here for a number of years before the other locations, and when they had only storefront.   Going to AYEC might have reduced quality a little to be honest.   I miss their shrimp sashimi special (1 lb for $7 when you order a minimum $ order)

I would say though their dynamite/tempura shrimp rolls are below par.   It is as if they prepare the shrimp in the morning and store it in the fridge and use it throughout the day.   It's never crispy...

I would still go here for a quick meal, but not for amazing sushi.

Great service though!"}
