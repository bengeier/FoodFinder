{"text":"REAL NAAN HERE. Not that grocery store plastic bag naan you get at some places. Cheaper than other Indian Thali joints of similar style, importantly they have better quality food. Tastes great, always hot and fresh. perfect for lunch or easy fast dinner."}
{"text":"Consistently good! I have only ordered delivery so I can't speak to a dining in experience but every delivery I've gotten is fantastic. The veggie korma is the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"Fantastic - EXCELLENT food. Was able to order online and add some changes, and the order was exactly correct.
Order was confirmed in a minute or so, and at the door within 30. Price changed by about a dollar from what it showed me online (but probably because of my requested changes in the comments) - didn't realize till after, so driver accidentally got slightly smaller tip than intended (sorry driver!)

Really REALLY good.
Perfect. :)"}
{"text":"So cute family run restaurant. Delicious and fresh Indian food for amazing price. Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely place, really welcoming staff and the food is delicious. I recommend going there with a few friends and eating in as it is a good experience. 
The real quality of the restaurant is the food though. Cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"Great prices and food, spiced really well and gives a real authentic Indian taste. Feels weird being served the food in what looks like a school dinner tray but don't let that deter you, great place and will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Very tasty, fast, and great value.  They are also so welcoming and helpful.  We eat here about once a week, and they have welcomed our baby since she was a newborn - the owner even offered to hold her once when she was fussy and we were trying to eat!  We need more of these kind of friendly, family-run businesses on The Main!"}
{"text":"Best Indian Food on the Plateau. Very Affordable, too!

Try the Dosas or the Thali. Both are a great value, and as tasty as Indian good gets.

The Plateau is challenged for Indian food. There are some really decent places if you want to sit down for a family or date meal, but very little that's quick and affordable. Curry Mahal is both of these things.

Whether you're veggie or omnivore, they have plenty of great option. If you haven't had a Dosa (hard to find in Montreal), I'd urge you to try these first. However, if you're looking for something that you're more familiar with, give the thalis a try. And, of course, if you want to go a-la-carte, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Really friendly service from the manager. There's a lot to choose from on the menu and the quality is very good. Will return."}
{"text":"A great little South Indian place specializing in dosa. The dosa was the best I've had in a long while; both the flavor and texture were perfect. The accompanying chutneys and sambar were exquisite. The meal made me nostalgic for when I lived in Karnataka for a short while, and the owners/staff were really nice. Definitely a gem to my taste!"}
{"text":"This is hands down so good i thought i died and went to curry heaving. so amazing!! I got the butter chicken, garlic naan, and lamb vindaloo. all i can say is-- WOW!!! flavor is both unique and authentic, definitely made with love! Incredibly flavorful, and run by a very sweet couple."}
{"text":"Awesome service- and such a great home cooked food! Highly recommend this place.
This location is conveniently located in downtown- and parking is off the street. 

The Indian chai is a pure Delish!"}
{"text":"Picked up paneer tikka masala with naan and a samosa. Food was ready fast and reasonably priced. The food was delicious, the curry was creamy, flavorful, and spicy. They gave plenty of paneer pieces. The naan was real tandoori cooked naan. And the samosa was crispy and had the right amount of breading. Great place for pickup!"}
{"text":"I came here all the time with my boyfriend when he worked on St. Laurent. Wonderful restaurant with the friendliest people. We've spoken with the owners every time we have come and they truly care about their business. We always get the vegetarian thali and it is delicious. Good sized portions and you always leave satiated. But, you should still take a samosa to go."}
{"text":"Très bonne surprise, naan fait en direct, super frais, je vous recommande vivement les sandwichs!"}
{"text":"Dee
Lish!!

I tried my hand at Curry Mahal while trying one of those Foodora coupons they've been tossing around the city. I'm not sure if this is due to the restaurant or the courier or the service itself but it was lightening fast! In about 25-30 minutes I had this delicious array of Indian delightful-ness at my door.

I ordered the vegetarian for 1.
I knew it came with a few things but I was surprised at how much food actually came. 

- veggie korma 
- 3 pakora 
- lentil soup
- palak paneer
- rice 
- naan

Thank God the BF was home because I could not have eaten it all. Their veggie korma is delicious, samosas are big and filling, and even their rice is cooked perfectly. They sell this all for $16.99 at the restaurant. Everything was flavourful, seasoned, and delicious."}
{"text":"I have been away from home for two months and have been missing my favorite Indian restaurant. The family that owns this place is so nice and sweet! The food was so yummy and the spices were amazing. 

My favorite part is that you can tell this place is family owned and operated. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was incredibley authentic, the woman who helped us (who is almost certainly the owner of this little family establishment) was wonderfully friendly and kind, and the prices were very reasonable. Moreover, their selection includes a very well made dosa and several imported Indian sodas. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was talking about Indian food in Charleston (where I live with my friends) recently, and we were comparing our favorite spots. I had this amazing flavor memory burning strong in my mind I wanted to tell them about, and could not place where in Charleston I'd had it...and then realized (sadly), it's because it was at Curry Mahal!  

Curry Mahal kicks the butt of all the Indian places I have in my town combined. It was so flavorful, fresh, and seemingly authentic. I've never been to India so I can't say for sure...but it seemed really legit.

The service was friendly and the price can't be beat.  I would've eaten there again the next day for lunch and dinner if they'd been open."}
{"text":"I'm relieved to find an indian place in my new city that doesn't drown everything in too much ghee. The spices are on point and meat is cut thoughtfully and is tender, and the veggies are plentiful.

Best indian food I think I've ever had, actually."}
{"text":"One of the best curry house's I've been to. We eat here a lot and never have a bad word to say of the place. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Ordered the thali with chickpeas and lamb curry. Price is right, but portions were very modest. Flavour is good, but the meal wasn't terribly satisfying. Could have used a little something extra; some sort of pickle or chutney, a touch of raita, or maybe a dessert à la Pushap. Bread was not as fresh as it could have been.

All in all, cheap, but not as cheap as Chef Guru. Good, but not as good as Darbar."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite to eat on a Saturday night. Food was fresh, fast, affordable, and perfectly spiced. Excellent service, they made us fresh naan bread! A great spot for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to have lunch or dinner. It's a small family owned restaurant and the woman who owns it is just great. We were here on vacation, we love Indian food but don't have much of it back home. The owner was incredibly helpful with ordering and helping us pick food that we would enjoy. You can tell she truly cares. The food was phenomenal and the whole place smelled amazing. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was really great! The pakoras and dhaniya chutney are to die for. We also loved the veg biryani, malai kofta, and the soft, airy naan. We'd definitely recommend trying this place if you're missing home-cooked desi food. The owners are really sweet, as well :) great find"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant based on Yelp's reviews and I was actually pretty disappointed. I love Indian food and savor all the variety and spices. Unfortunately, I didn't find much of that here. The naan and soup were good but otherwise the veggie korma was bland and the chicken tikka was dry and lacking in the soaked-through flavor that I love about the dish. I'm stunned by the overwhelmingly positive reviews. It was passable but only just."}
{"text":"I decided to give it a shot on lunch time as I was craving for Indian food. I chose the thaali vegetarian with 3 curries. They were so good!!! Loved the fact that it's like a mini canteen where you're served by the lady who's friendly. The food was good for the price I paid. The place itself is not too bad but just a place to sit but you're coming for the food not for the decor. I left full and happy for my tummy."}
{"text":"Just got done having the delivery from Curry Mahal, and definitely felt the need to sing its praises immediately. First of all, cheers to the 45 minute delivery after being told it would probably be an hour. Also, the delivery man didn't wait at the front entrance, he came all the way to the apartment.

To the important things... The food was great. I lived in India for 3 months and this was some of the best Indian food I've had since I've been back. I love Chana masala and I thought this one was very good. Most of the other dishes were not necessarily my favorite I've ever had (for instance I know a place with better tikka masala in my opinion), but every dish was very good. I was a big fan of the rice, and I was glad they gave us a lot.

Finally I found all the prices to be VERY reasonable. Two good sized samosas for $3. Most of the dishes were less than $12. (It seemed especially cheap to me given I'm an American and the exchange rate is so good, but still.... I felt like it was a steal.)"}
{"text":"Paneer aux épinards: très ordinaire.
Lamb vindaloo: très épicé. Pas assez tomaté. OK
Butter chicken: celui de Ricardo est meilleur! (Et ce n'est pas la vrai recette...)"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best Indian food I've ever... No, this is the absolute best food! I've ever had. The flavors are incredible, and the smells are to die for. 

The owner is like the mother you wish you had. She genuinely cares about you, and what you'll like. We went in having no idea what to order, she patiently walked us through ordering and checked on us multiple times to make sure everything was great. It was better than great, it was perfect."}
{"text":"This is one of the best quality food Indian restaurants I have ever been to..  This was my first time here today and I ordered Shahi Paneer and Chole Samosa..  Both of them were REALLY awesome!  I would definitely recommend this place to any Indian food lover!"}
{"text":"Come for the thali and the friendly service. I've been here either two or three times, all in the winter and each time was worth parallel parking in the snow. Samosa, naan, rice and veggie korma were all out of the park good. You can get your lassi or thumbs from the fridge. The duo behind the counter are super nice and patient. I will say it's chilly because of the direct line of air from the front door, and navigating the bathroom is a bit of a chore...so, wear a sweater and hit the head before you leave the house."}
{"text":"Merci Yelp de m'avoir fait découvrir cet endroit! La nourriture est simplement delicieuse et les portions vachement généreuses.
Je ne crois pas avoir déjà mangé un meilleur poulet au beurre. Explosion de saveurs en bouche!
Le service est rapide, la nourriture est fraîche. 
Je vais clairement y retourner!"}
{"text":"Ever since the nice lady left somewhere on a trip, the food has taken a serious turn for the worse. While all the dishes look the same, there is less flavour in them and you can tell they taste cheaper. Sad because I loved this place. Your loyal customers can tell when you change the food!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, filling, and delicious. Under $10 for an enormous meal. The butter chicken is very sweet and so is the vegetable korma so I would recommend getting something else (such as vegetables or just other curries) if you prefer a more balanced palette(?). I crave this from time to time and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Surprized at the high reviews. Went here for dinner with a bunch of friends on a Tuesday night. There was no one there at about 8pm. So maybe it's busy at lunch time?

Food was already prepared in a counter (cafeteria style). Seemed like it had been sitting there for a while. 

The server / person behind counter was very rude. Instead of us sampling multiple things and 3-4 of us ordering, we were so put off by the rudeness. 

Food was mediocre at best. 

Never again.."}
{"text":"Our visit for dinner was absolutely wonderful. It's a small restaurant with just a few tables; it looked like most people came in for take-out, but there was also a party of maybe 10 people in the corner as well, so they are very accommodating with the space.

My BF and I got the non-vegetarian combo for two, and they were kind enough to point out that the additional chicken samosas we had ordered might not be necessary because the combo comes with 2 veggie samosas; they substituted them for us at a charge less than the order of chicken samosas. 

Everything was amazing. Absolutely amazing. The crust of the samosas was delectable, the butter chicken was so rich, the cauliflower dish melted in your mouth. The combo came with gulab jaman for dessert and we have plenty of food left over to have lunch for the two of us tomorrow. 

The atmosphere and treatment by the owners/managers was so warm, attentive, and loving, the fact that the food was phenomenal as well just seemed to complete the package. 

I don't live in Montreal, but this is definitely my most favourite place EVER to get some wonderful Indian food cooked and served by some of the most beautiful and loving people."}
{"text":"Came here because of the review when we saw it was a curry stand and not a sit down restaurant, we opted out. My girlfriend had to use the bathroom, I was reprimanded because we decided on a sit down rather than an \"after bar\" place but used the bathroom. When she returned she mentioned the bathroom was very dirty, and we would have left anyway had we sat down. A bathroom is an indicator of a commitment to hygiene. We left and ate the next place west up the street at a place that had an Indian type logo rather than a word two blocks west, it was fantastic and close to the same price Don't go here, go there instead!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place after seeing all the good reviews and it did not disappoint. It is a small restaurant with a few tables and chairs if you wish to sit down and eat or they also offer take-out/delivery if you live near the area. Very friendly staff ! I tried the vegetarian thali, I loved their naan bread and the vegetarian sauces. My favorite was the vegetable korma, I also enjoyed the zucchini & mixed vegetables. Flavorful with a hint of spicy. On the other hand, the pakora was a bit cold and not the best I tasted, way too thick/too much flour and the rice was bland. The portion of the thali was a bit small so I suggest getting bigger portions if you know what you want to eat. It's definitely worth taking a look."}
{"text":"YUM! My husband and I were craving indian food and this hit the spot. It's listed as a $$ but it's really more of a $ in my opinion. I'm new to the area so I'm not super familiar with the pricing yet, but everything seemed pretty cheap. I guess if you got multiple things it would be $$ though. The restaurant is definitely geared towards takeout so the ambiance is very takeout casual, but I don't really care that much as long as the food is good. 

We got the non-vegetarian combo for two and it was a ton of food! The lentil soup was AMAZING! I've had a lot of indian lentil soups before and this is probably the best I've ever had. It was a little sour and spicy and sweet all at the same time. The samosa was also solid and came with the standard sauces. Even the papadum was slightly more tasty than normal papadum.

The main course was butter chicken (also had the choice of korma), lamb curry (also had the choice of chicken) and a vegetable dish with cauliflower and rice. The butter chicken was super different from any of the other butter chickens I've had. It was pretty sweet - I heard someone at a table next to us describe is as being like maple chicken - but even still I thought it was tasty just different. The lamb curry was standard but also good and the veggie dish was great! We got four pieces (large halves) of naan and it was fresh and warm and very soft. Delicious! 

Dessert was gulab jamun served warm and tasty. I was so full but luckily it was just one so I'm glad I was able to fit it into my stomach. Mango lassi also good. 

The people working there were super nice and attentive and I will definitely come back here! They had a lot on their menu and we really love indian food. 

The only slightly off thing was the combination of sounds that seemed to be going on in the restaurant. My husband described it as \"the soundtrack that you play for someone you're trying to slowly torture.\" There was a low indian vocal soundtrack with some sort of 8-bit game music (there were some children in the back playing a game) and then also a ton of frequent cat meows (might have been the game? Couldn't tell.) I didn't notice it at first and it was mostly just really funny to me."}
{"text":"The Curry Mahal combo is a great choice for a quick and filling lunch. The curry here is great! My favourite is the butter chicken, rich with aroma and flavour. :)"}
{"text":"I used to live near the provigo street, I tried this restaurant like two months ago, and I went there for lunch or dinner under -30 weather. Their butter chicken and naan are the best I've ever seen. Especially the naan bread, perfect thickness and flavor.(I tried 20+ Indian restaurants last year in downtown)

AMAZING FOOD, UNBELIEVABLE LOW PRICE, NICE STAFF, RUN THERE!"}
{"text":"I got delivery from here, but everything was kinda flavourless and it seemed like t was all bulked out with peas. I like peas but I don't want THAT many peas in my rice. I just want rice.

The poppadoms also come rolled up which makes them look nice but they're REALLY hard to eat like that.

I just didn't really enjoy any of the food here."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and got the veggie Thali, it came out to roughly 12$ with tip/tax.

The service was good, the guy who served me was nice and attentive.

The food was delicious! good naan, butter chicken, etc."}
{"text":"This place is unreal.  My wife and I go two or three times a week. If there's an indian restaurant in town with cheaper, more flavourful food, I've yet to find it.

We usually take the Thali, and we're consistently impressed with the quality of the vegetarian curries that go in it. On top of this, their naan is usually made fresh to order, and, well, you can't beat fresh naan!

Go. Just go. It'll be the best decision you made all day."}
{"text":"I have a mad crush on Curry Mahal and the adorable couple who run it. Today is the third time I have picked up takeout from them in two weeks, and as a rule I usually only eat takeout once a month. It's THAT good.

I am slowly working my way through the menu, but it's really hard because I like everything I've tasted so much and I just want it again. Like the crispy onion bhajis bursting with flavour... I can't NOT order them. I do not have that kind of willpower. And chana samosa... Do yourself a favour and eat it. The lamb, whatever sauce you choose, is so tender. The naan is epic. The mattar paneer converted my mattar paneer-hating husband into a lover of it, and we both get seriously possessive of leftovers. 

This food is so good that if you eat it alone you will find yourself speaking aloud, to the food, about how good it is. And asking it questions like, \"How? Why? What is happening in my mouth?\" 

Don't forget to order raita - you're gonna need it. I feel like the price is reasonable but I always order everything I want and then just eat leftovers for days so I'm not a great source. 

Shoutout to the super nice owners who are on the ball when it comes to allergies, special requests, and customer service."}
{"text":"This place is great for fast, cheap and very delicious indian food! I took one of their thalis and a potato filled samosa and they were both fantastic! They have a variety of curries to choose from and i took the lentil curry and butter chicken. Alongside the curries, there was a small salad and some naan. Everything was delicious--the naan was warm and soft, the curries were perfectly spiced and the samosa was crispy but I do wish they had given the samosa with some chutney. Aside from that, the meal was still very good and pretty cheap as well!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a small quiet restaurant. A little bit run-down on the inside. It's not a sit-down restaurant where you can order from a menu. Instead, you order at the counter and it's given to you on a tray.

FOOD: The butter chicken was absolutely delicious! Surprisingly, although the chicken pieces seem big, making you believe that it may be dry, that wasn't the case at all. The meat was tender and full of flavor. The curry itself was very creamy, smooth and flavorful as well. The veggie korma wasn't the BEST in my opinion but it was still good. Unfortunately the naan was a little bit burnt but that wasn't too big of a deal. Also, I expected the food to have more spices, especially for an authentic Indian restaurant but it was still good.

PRICE: For the area, it's very affordable. Prices range from 1$ (appetizers) to 12$. Definitely worth it.

SERVICE: Although it's not your classic waiter service, the worker that prepared the food was very friendly and took the time to explain the different options that were offered."}
{"text":"Very casual place , tasty flavour if you like spice of course but the chicken samosa and there sauces are yummy ."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal and decided to try this place out. The food was really very good, and it tasted very homemade Indian. Everything from the chicken to the lamb to the thali everything spot on. We decided to do 2 nights in a row eating at this place. The family that runs the place is just awesome and friendly and they gave my kid a toy to take away. A++"}
