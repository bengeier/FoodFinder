{"text":"Great pizza. They make it fresh and it comes out perfect. I live the fact that they have 3 sizes. I find the snack size works well for me. Interior is really comfortable and attractive."}
{"text":"They have a few set pizzas you can choose, or build your own, plus some very good salad options.  I've been a few times, and it's always good food and good service.  I've been with lactose-free, gluten-free, and vegan friends before, and they could always find things on the menu they liked.    Atmosphere is pretty cool- friendly staff, good music, not too bright.  And they're licensed if you want to enjoy wine/beer with your meal.  I've been here a dozen times or more, and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"The interior decor is quite nice for a casual pizza place. It definitely a photo-worthy place with pink and turquoise colour accent throughout the restaurant and marble tables. I was definitely reluctant to try this place since I have heard about it all over a certain social media app. I honestly had wondered if it actually lived up to the hype of being more than a photogenic restaurant and it did! More than just being a mediocre slice of pizza, it honestly lived up to the hype. The staff that worked there were friendly and was helpful with helping us decide on a size.   My friend and I got two small size pizzas to share- we went with their version of the Hawaiian called \"Aloha Smoke\" and \"Hunt & Peck\" with a delicious twist on pizza toppings- topping the pizza with eggs with runny yolks. You order it at the front, it is made to order. The pizza arrived pipping hot and crispy. Their pizza crusts were thin style but provided a good base for the pizza. The pizza were flavourful, crust included. Out of the two, my friend and I agree that \"Aloha Smoke\" was our favourite as it had a bit of heat to it.  I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Cute place with made to order pizzas. They shape their dough into long rectangles which remind me of beaver tails lol. Great concept and best yet, you get unlimited toppings!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, friendly staff, beautiful restaurant and great atmosphere.   Went with some friends and shared the super fresh and delicious pizza. It was fun to see the pizza getting prepared and baked right behind the counter.   The only downside was the pretty high prices."}
{"text":"Don't. Do. It.   On a positive: the people working were nice but the \"pizza\"? Yuck. The dough was cardboard, flavourless. And more of a (really) flatbread. Toppings were minimal. There was supposed to be meat (we got the Hunt & Peck) but it was hardly noticeable. No salt, hot oil, chilies or seasonings could help. We ate 1 piece each, closed the box, and then went to The Burger's Priest (and bought dinner for the second time...)."}
{"text":"Light, good flavour, and fresh. These three words describes the pizza I had at True True.  I've had True True before at the Union Summer market a couple years ago and when it opened up here on Queen. I had to go back and try something new on their complete menu. Upon entering, the menus are located on the right of the cashier, on the wall. Then I decided to try the Date night pizza in the personal size. (They have small, personal or large). The total came out to be $15.80 for the personal size of my pizza.  It took around 5-10 minutes for them to make and bake the pizza. It came out hot and the taste was great. The dough had great taste and texture while the overall ingredients gave my pizza a savory feel to it. It is definitely different from the average pizza places as I find this place a bit more gourmet.   Overall, it's definitely worth a trip to visit True True at least once."}
{"text":"My husband, sister and I really love this place. This location has the same food quality and service as the original location on King. We came here on a normal day first (i.e. not the super busy free-pizza day that everyone came for) and had a medium custom pizza for $21, and it fed 3 people (though we weren't super hungry, so if you're starving I recommend the largest size).  I used to think that pizza could not be good unless baked in a brick oven, but here they have like a conveyor belt type of toaster oven. Don't knock it 'till you try it! They're super fast too.   So for those who came here during the free pizza day and only tried the pepperoni pizza, I strongly recommend you come back and try the Aristocrat or do a custom one!"}
{"text":"Just a quickie for ya! I'm sure I will be back here again but for now a three star meaning A-OK, but did not overwhelm me. I like the spot, clean lines, as in chic Italian interior with a gorgeous tin ceiling and well-thought out layout inside. I ordered a medium pizza, tomato sauce with bacon and pineapple thinking a small would be too small for me and I always like a couple leftovers the next day.  The pizza came out of the oven delivered to my table by the friendly staff, nice and hot, and tasted delicious, and so delicious that I devoured it in just a few minutes. The taste was there, with a nice balance of tang and sweetness to the sauce, and tasty toppings scattered on top, but it lacked the substance that made me feel satisfied after eating a greasy slag (cheese?). It could use more sauce or whatever that gives a pizza body. In fact, this za would be a great appetizer! The crust is thin, Italian style and made for nice little crunchy bites rather than big mouth-filling chunky ones. If you are a fan of these pizzas, you will probably like them here. But still, not quite on par with Kensignton's Pizzeria Via Mercanti or possibly Maker Pizza up and around the corner from True True on Cameron. Nice to see the competition for tasty slices heat up! Pizza is a personal thing for people. Everyone has their cravings for a slice of slag and mine still is Fresca Pizza on College and Robert Street. Something about dumping more of their greasy mess of oil mixed with basil that turns me on. But, if you haven't tried True True, go and try something and let's hear more opinions!"}
{"text":"Fabulous shop n tasty salad . I ate it out so fast that I didn't even take a picture. Me and my friend got a free cookie accidentally. True True made my day. Thank you (????)"}
{"text":"The decor is amazing and the food is even better. You can pick whatever toppings you want and it's baked to perfection."}
{"text":"True True Pizza offers a variety of specialty pizzas, gourmet salads, and sandwiches.  Their pizzas are made to order with fresh ingredients and and baked in just two minutes.  You can choose from their signature pizzas or create your own customized one.  Their pizzas are uniquely shaped in a long oblong shape.  They also offer a choice of gluten free dough!  I really enjoyed my half-half pizza!  The Blue Sally included a classic tomato sauce, fior di latte, blue cheese, napoli salami, pickled red onions, and fresh parmesan.  With three types of cheese, my pizza was exactly what I wanted with lots of cheese.  I really loved the thin crust.  The crust wasn't too crispy either (I've had a pizza recently where the crust was so crispy that it tasted like I was eating a cracker).  This pizza was very good.  The three types of cheese blended together to create the perfect strong taste of cheese-- the blue cheese was the winner here.  The classic tomato sauce was a great pairing too.  The napoli salami was very thin and thus made it easy to eat with the rest of the pizza.   The Hunt & Peck included a spicy tomato sauce, fior di latte, spinach, chorizo sausage, farm eggs, fresh parmesan, chili oil, and cracked black pepper.  I really liked the look of this pizza.  The farm egg was my favourite part of this pizza and was baked to a warm yolk that wasn't runny (I like it that way).  The combination of the spicy tomato sauce, chorizo sausage, and cracked black pepper gave the pizza a really spicy kick!  If you want a spicy pizza, this is it.  By way of comparison, this pizza was much saucier and spicier than the Blue Sally.  \"The Honeymoon\" Pressed Sandwich consisted of grilled chicken, marinated kale, smoked bacon, parmesan cheese, with a lemon garlic dressing on their signature focaccia bread.  This was pressed in their panini grill upon ordering for about 3 to 4 minutes.  Mmm, this was such a big portion!  I really liked the lemon garlic dressing.  I think that anything chicken and bacon makes for a great sandwich and indeed this sandwich was a winner too.   The \"Heartbeet\" salad had green kale, red & white quinoa, beets, pecans, dried cherries, sliced orange, and dressed in a creamy maple balsamic.  The creamy maple balsamic really made the salad a good one by combining all of the fresh ingredients together.  Their cookies are baked fresh in-house daily.  I really liked how chunky and chocolaty the cookie was."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! When I went, it was completely empty which was surprising considering how amazing this place is! I had the \"into the wild\" pizza with mushrooms, blue cheese, and truffle oil. The crust was really thin and it wasn't too heavy which was good. Price was also pretty good for the portion I got. They offer 3 different prices depending on the portion you want (so there are lots of options). I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I went to their grand opening party with some other fellow yelpers an hour before it was open to the public. True True was giving away whole pizzas so people can try them out. They offered a meat and veggie version given the number of people that they were expecting. When I arrived, the staff had already prepared the toppings for many pizzas and then started to place them in the oven when people arrived.  It was like a well oil machine churning out pizzas.  The welcome staff were great and quickly got the VIPs in before letting everyone else at 6 pm. Too bad it was raining which may have dampened the mood. The place is caters to takeout as the place is quite small with only 10 tables. It was also good that they put a paper lining at the bottom of the box to soak up the grease which was minimal. The boxes should be recyclable.   I will come back to try their regular selection of pizzas. Overall, the pizza was thin crust and very filling."}
{"text":"Just had my last pizza here. Been coming since it used to be called One Pizza and up until recently the allure of this place was that you pay one price and can choose whatever toppings you like! With each visit the toppings seemed to decrease and the staff's level of attitude increased. Found out tonight that each topping is now a separate charge. When I expressed my disappointment the staff said their new system is much better for their business model. Thanks True True, not sure if alienating your current customers is also part of this great new model? You've lost our group, best of luck to you."}
{"text":"Definitely better Margherita pizza available nearby.  I like the small sized option. Music was way too loud.  Just annoying, nothing more than an example of one hipster assuming everyone wants to hear her crappy blaring music.. Move the tables, then the super loud music can be danced to.."}
{"text":"TRUE to their word, the pizza comes out quick in this small pizza joint. You can build your own pizza or order one of the signatures.  I got the Hunt & Peck. The crust/base is very light and crispy and the ingredients do look nice and fresh. Taste was good. Even though there was a small line, it still got made quickly and they brought it out to me. The personal size is plenty."}
{"text":"Been to the King East location before, visited this one. I love True True- it's my go-to pizza place. The personal size pizza makes it cute and a perfect casual date spot. Love the decor too. Staff is friendly and outgoing."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Toronto so far. A lil but on the pricier side but worth it. I tried the custom pizza option."}
{"text":"So overrated. Sure, there are a few interesting ingredients- but they are skimpy with the toppings, and the dough/crust is nothing to write home about. The staff is REALLY Lovely, but doesn't make up for the very mediocre pizza. This hipster joint just doesn't deliver the substance for me to return."}
{"text":"I came here for the promotional event, where they were giving away free pizza.  They only had two options: Vegetarian or meat, I chose the meat.   Food (4 stars): Looking at the menu, it would have cost around $14 for the pizza, (8 slices).  The pizza was pretty good, thin crust, the one thing that set it apart from other pizza places is the cheese they put on top of the pizza - delicious.    Atmosphere: (3 stars) Has enough tables to fit around 20 people, but not a place I would chose to dine in.   Very simple layout.  Overall:  for $14 I do not think it is worth the price, especially since the place does not look that comfortable.  If you want to try it I would recommend takeout."}
{"text":"Fresh, flavourful, Instagrammable, and quick to make! One of my favourite pizza-making restaurants in Toronto (next is Pi Co)! Just as good as the TrueTrue on King but the location is much more convenient for me.  A tip if you're new to making your own pizza. If you want to add spinach to it, ask for it first before they put on the cheese and the rest of the toppings, otherwise the spinach will burn. They typically don't tell you this at the beginning."}
{"text":"If pizza is one of your TRUE loves, you don't want to miss this place!   True True is a cute, open-concept restaurant, offering gourmet pizza (and salads and sandwiches) without the long wait.   Their decor reminds me more of a trendy nail salon than a pizza place! Granite tables, gorgeous ceilings and minimalistic decor.   What I loved most about this restaurant is that all the pizzas are made right in front of you, allowing you to customize it on the spot. I chose the \"Into the Wild\" Pizza and substituted the blue cheese with ricotta.   ... And all ready in a matter of minutes!   It was truly delicious! If you're a mushroom/truffle oil fan, this is definitely the pizza for you!"}
{"text":"The good: Stylish pizza, with a dash of truth to their traditional roots and a dash of true craft (reasoning behind their name). The pizza was delicious, I ordered the Johny Power, personal pizza. The stylish pizza is supposed to be ready quick, in 5 mins.   The size is generous, enough for even two small people! The decor is also lovely, perfect for a date. The staff are friendly too.  The bad: A little on the higher end for a pizza, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"While I'm typically a fan of the build-your-own pizza places, this one just didn't hit home with me. Being my first time there, the staff was very friendly and helpful, but I just didn't enjoy the final product. The crust was not very consistent, and the toppings were not evenly cooked. I can see that they are trying to go with some sort of hipster-chic theme, but that didn't connect with me at all, and the flow of counter has been done better by the competition. No soda fountain, having to pay for parking at the lot around the corner, and having the building shake like a mini-earthquake every time the TTC train went by are just some of the other minor gripes that combined to make my whole experience disappointing."}
{"text":"We spent a fun evening here with a few other Yelpers and had some really good pizza!   We tried the Johnny Power (sausage, leeks, spinach, mushrooms,squash & Parmesan on a sesame crust) and the Aristocrat (Tomato, Mozzarella, Garlic, Pesto, Arugula, Olive Oil & Parmesan) We met a new friend (Tracy) who shared some of her gluten free pizza with us as well - I believe it was the 1/2 Aristocrat and 1/2 into the wild - Check out Tracy M's review for more information on that! Check out my photos for more on prices of the pizza and their menu.  The Johnny Power is only on the Summer menu so please get in here and get it while you can.   I have to say, I absolutely AM more of a pizza traditionalist and the sesame crust threw me off and so did the oven but after we got our pizzas, they were DELICIOUS! It was about 7 minutes from order get our pizza and it was definitely the way we like pizza. The crust was thin and well done, the topping were all really flavourful and there is even some chilli oil on the side that you absolutely must have on your pizza. The selection of toppings were really fresh and that is a major plus in my books! The staff was friendly and the service was great.   Side note: if you like trufle oil, the 'Into the Wild' Is a must have.   We had a chance to meet one of the owners, Tim who went on to explain where the name of the restaurant came from - being True to the pizza but conversely being true to yourself by letting you go crazy and letting you top it with whatever the hell you want!!! I guess the customer IS always right :)    We asked about the tomatoes and we were told that they ar Stanislaus tomatoes which is an A+ in my books. Frank Pinello and all the other pizza greats of New York rave about these tomatoes.  Crust 4/5 - Thin crust and crispy bottom, delicious and flavourful airy base. outer crunch inner mmmm.  Toppings: 4.5/5 Really fresh and all soooo tasty.  Speed: 5/5 Service 5/5   We will definitely be back to True True. Thanks for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"What to try??  Their wonderful gourmet pizzas!   I truly enjoyed my royal treatment at true true on Tuesday night. Thanks for hosting the yelp elites Tim.   I thought the pizzas were cooked to my satisfaction and I enjoyed the company of fellow elites as well! Thanks also to Evelyn for organizing the event for the Yelp elites.   I was able to customize my own pizza. I ordered the into the wild pizza but substituted the blue cheese with daiya mozzarella, added a protein - chorizo sausage and a veggie - spinach. I enjoyed seeing my pizza being made fresh as I walked down the restaurant to see toppings added to my pizza like I was at subway seeing my sub being made! The ingredients tasted really fresh and I got to try other pizzas too from other fellow elite members.   It really didn't take a long time for the restaurant to prepare my pizza. Tim mentioned that they are different because they use fresh ingredients and they do personalized pizza very fast. I didn't have to wait long before I got my pizza and when it was served, the pizza was still hot. I liked the thin crust of the pizza and it's a pretty big portion for the price you're paying. I wish the crust was a bit crispier though and if there was more seasoning on the crust edges, I think the pizza experience will be even better. Usually crusts are the last part anyone wants to eat, but if it was done in a way that makes the customer want to get the crust, customers will remember your pizza!   Last tip?   If you like your pizza hot, I suggest the devil in disguise - got a nice kick. If you like your pizza different, maybe try the pizza with beet pesto or béchamel."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Really well done. I had the Aristocrat pizza and it was delicious. The crust is perfectly chewy without being heavy, and the tomato sauce tastes like TOMATO... Very good tomato. I was impressed, and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. Crust is amazing- especially the sesame crust - so flavorful -Kinda remind me of a bagel. Toppings are great, you can even build your own pizza"}
{"text":"Not as good as I expected.  I preordered Donnie Brasco it's a meat pizza which consist  of Classic Tomato, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Fennel Sausage, Chorizo Sausage, Pepperoni, Pickled Red Onions, Fresh Parmesan, Oregano for pick up In 20 mins. Arrived exactly in 20 mins to pick it up . The box was cold when I picked up the pizza.  As expected when i opened the box,  the pizza was also cold .  It was cold and also dry.  No flavour at all. Hence why the business didn't last.  It was only open for 6 months than closed down. No business ? You can see why ."}
