{"text":"We had lunch at the Red Bird Cafe on Friday, June 12. This was the first
day they opened. We had excellent coffee and I had a Turkey Gratitude
wrap.  Wow - what a tasty treat. I also enjoyed a \"Chomeur\" muffin -
this could be a favourite.  My wife had the Tam - Tams wrap and a
Strawberry Rhubarb muffin - she raved about them both.

Somehow we found ourselves back for lunch on Sunday.  I could not help
myself  - Turkey Gratitude again!  I ended with perhaps the best Carrot
cake I ever had.

The staff and owner are all friendly and helpful.  

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"To be exact (3.5). Their coffee selection was pretty limited. I went in wanting a cold refreshing iced latte but it seems that they don't have anything iced as of the moment. However I did see a wide selection of baked goods, salads, and sandwiches. It might be a good idea to pop in here for a quick lunch some time.

I ended up getting a chai latte and their sweet potato muffin. Not a bad combo! I'm definitely no connoisseur of chai lattes but I liked how the spices weren't too pungent. Paired with the fluffy sweet potato muffin with sunflower seeds and raisins, you definitely get the epitome of fall flavours in your mouth. 

The decor at this place was pretty simple. Freshly painted white walls and mostly wooden accents. I do think they could use a bit more seating around the place though."}
{"text":"Nouveau café/boulangerie sur le boulevard St-Laurent sur le Plateau. Ils ont des salades bio, sandwichs santés et soupes. Mon sandwich ''Tam-Tams'' 8.35$ était bon mais sans plus. D'ailleurs, on nous propose de faire un combo sandwich & soupe/salade & café pour 13,74$ plutôt que de choisir à l'unité. Ils ont aussi bien sûr des cafés/expressos/lattés & desserts/pâtisseries. L'endroit est calme pour lire/travailler, presque pas de clients lors de mon passage en après-midi. Déco simple avec des cadres sur les murs. Endroit propre. Le commis au comptoir était sympa. Ils ont une petite terrasse avant. Wifi gratuit.

J'y retournerai peut-être un jour pour essayer leurs salades.
