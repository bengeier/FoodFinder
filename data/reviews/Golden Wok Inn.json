{"text":"I don't know what these other people are talking about with their review, but this place is TERRIBLE!.  Growing up in and still living in Bethel Park, I have tried this place several times over the past 20 years and it always disappoints.  The last time I was there, I got the \"Pineapple chicken\" special.  It was repulsive and I couldn't even eat it.  It consisted of rubbery chicken and canned pineapple chunks in a ton of MAYONNAISE!  Totally disgusting.  The service is awful and the food and atmosphere is even worse.  This restaurant is disgusting, dark and dingy.  Seriously, go anywhere else.  There are plenty of other Chinese restaurants very close by."}
{"text":"I had the Sesame chicken lunch portion and it was great. The chicken was quality white meat and the rice was perfect. I took a chance on this place and I'm glad I did. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been to the Golden Wok Inn a few times in the past. I haven't been there in a few years. I was in the area and had a craving for chinese and figured I'd order from Golden Wok Inn. I knew I liked it in the past so I was excited to get from there again. The 2 workers I encountered were very friendly and both thanked us for our business. The food did not take long at all to make, about 20 min. I ordered a chicken lo mein, general tsos, and 2 egg rolls. All 3 of the items were delicious. I haven't had luck with other chinese food restaurants other times I ordered from them. Golden Wok Inn is where I will order chinese food from now on!"}
{"text":"I have several reasons for giving this the outlier review (I'm giving it a full 5 stars versus everyone else's 1-2 stars).  First of all, I don't go there for the ambiance, and as such, in this yelp, ambiance doesn't even count for 10% of my opinion for a Chinese (in this case, Hong Kong regional) restaurant.  The reason for this is simple:  I have never (NEVER) been to a super clean and trendy upscale Chinese restaurant in this country that has had food even CLOSE to the quality of a hole-in-the-wall restaurant that serves up family recipes.  I lived for four years in Manhattan and had a lovely sampling of Chinese food, but the highest quality authentic food came from Chinatown, which in NYC is dirty... the restaurants included.  In San Francisco, I had great Chinese food at a similarly dingy and dimly lit place.  So to be fair, I am overlooking the atmosphere of Golden Wok and focusing instead on its food and waitstaff.  The husband and wife team with their children are usually very pleasant and happy to see patrons.  I am a regular patron (my whole family is), as well as our neighbors. It is kid friendly.  The egg rolls are good. I'm not an egg roll person myself, but I'll eat them from this place. However, I did notice that recently the order size has diminished to one egg roll per order instead of two.  If you like General Tso's Chicken (like what, 80% of people who go to Chinese restaurants), then I would highly recommend ordering it with white meat only and extra spicy.  As-is, the dish is on the sweet side.  Ordering it with the extra spice gives it the burn you're looking for.  Ordering it with white meat only lets you bypass that whole \"mystery meat\" that many Americans swear is cat meat.  The quality of the white meat is very good. I've ordered this exact dish for about five years from Golden Wok and have never once been disappointed. When done really well, it is better than PF Chang's Chang's Chicken, and when done regularly, it's still a good rival in taste but with more chicken than PF Chang's gives you, and without the wait that you always experience at PFCB.  I'm not sure what the yelper A.R. was thinking when he called the General Tso's bland, because I've yet to find a General Tso's Chicken at a restaurant in the Greater Pittsburgh area that even comes close to the flavor here.  There's a place in Scott Township, and then there's PF Chang's, but it's hands-down more flavorful than the General from  Sesame Inn, Panda Express, Panda Garden, and all of the places in the malls or which have all-you-can-eat buffets.  The other clear-cut winning dish that we've discovered is the chicken Mai Fun noodles. These are thin noodles.  Their woks are seasoned well, and when they cook this dish you get a nice smoky flavor thrown in. The noodles are a favorite with my whole family.  The vegetables are nice, but the white meat chicken (not special order, this is standard) is thinly sliced and palatable.  My neighbor and I bring guests to Golden Wok to help ensure that it stays in business because it's close to our home and has the de-facto best Chinese food in the South Hills when it comes to flavor.  If I had to pick a second it would be Mark Pi's China Gate, but I would pick Golden Wok 9/10 times over that as well."}
{"text":"I am picky about my Chinese food. I love that you can request white meat only for some of their dishes and a lot of the stir fried dishes come with thinly sliced white meat anyway. Golden Wok has homemade egg rolls. I have watched the grandmother roll these and make the won tons while we have eaten there. This is not a place you go to for ambiance, but rather, a place you go to for good, quality Chinese food (and they adequately address requests to make things extra spicy) with typically quick service and pleasant staff. Over the years the owners have grown to recognize us and even remember our usual orders. Their kiddos are often around and this place if very family-friendly. I think this place gets most of their business as take out, but if you get take out, just go pick it up if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Chinese is usually pretty sketchy.. But we seem to really like this place! Haven't had a bad experience yet. I'm a picky eater and I love this place. We always go with the general tsos and the orange chicken both not spicy and the fried rice. Best fried rice ever. The portions are large, one order feeds 2-3 people easily."}
{"text":"Great tasting, quality Chinese at an inexpensive price! My boyfriend and I order from here often for take out and have never had any complaints. Family owned, very sweet people."}
{"text":"Ugh. This place is nice inside, but the food sucks! I found an eggshell in my chicken dish, the service was bad, and the dumplings hardly had any meat in them. I wouldn't go back or recommend it."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a second-rate strip mall.  It is old and dated, not particularly comfortable or attractive.  The middle aged lady who greeted us and began serving us was pleasant and smiling.  She provided one water refill.  She left the restaurant not long after taking our orders and we were then served, in a way, by a teenage girl who was doing paperwork and disinterested in service.  I ordered chicken egg roll, tofu with mixed vegetables soup, and tofu with mixed vegetables.  As minute after minute passed with no food, I figured we would not be receiving one course at a time and I was right.  The egg roll and the soup came together after fifteen minutes and the entrees followed within five minutes.  My entree came to the table first, then within a minute, my lady's entree was delivered. The egg roll was tasty, but small.  The soup had many good things in it, but hardly any taste.  The tofu was surprising excellent: a good portion served in a rich sauce, but there were only a few snow peas and slivers of carrot in it.  No one performed a quality check.  The restaurant is only slightly less expensive than my favorite, Red Tea House in Mount Lebanon: a beautiful, attractive restaurant with ambience, where the diner immediately receives the best crispy fried noodles and refills (complimentary) to keep them happily munching as they wait for their food.  I would dine at Golden Wok Inn again only for convenience as it is closer to my home than some of the fine Chinese restaurants.  I can do better."}
{"text":"The restaurant has been here for years.  Consistently good and friendly service!   My favorite is General Tso with white meat.  Don't pay attention to the bad reviews.  They are probably tough to please."}
{"text":"Kay and I came here the other evening for dinner after having caught sight of it a few times in our travels. Golden Wok Inn sits in a little-known South Hills shopping plaza, and compared to the other businesses nearby, its exterior is reasonably striking.   The insides are rather quaint and stylish as well, and we did not find GWI to be at all \"disgusting, dark, and dingy\" as one vengeful Yelper put it.   That's not to say that our dining experience was flaming pineapples in bourbon, though. Putrid? No.  Dull, inept? Yeah.   The service, while not atrocious, was certainly below par, and aside from a quite tasty wonton soup, we didn't find anything exceptional about our meal.  Ooops. Wait.  Kay did find something in her Orange Chicken. An egg shell to be exact. So, I'm forced to dock another star for that. GWI coulda been a 3...  The rest of the meal consisted of steamed dumplings that were filled by a miser (where's the pork?) and on my end, an order of Kung Pao Scallops that were skimpy on the seafood and loaded with everything else, including vegetables and peanuts.   When you see GWI, I'd advise yas to just keep drivin'."}
{"text":"The place had an odor and my food was not spicy enough. (Asked for very spicy dragon phoenix.) Not coming back."}
{"text":"we've been going here for several years now. it's where we go for chinese food. they do a big take-out service, but we could never understand why it's usually not busier. your loss!  they've become a byob place, so a pot of tea & a bottle of red, we were ready to begin!  we started with a pu pu platter. it's a mix of appetizers-fried chicken, egg rolls, marinated beef on a skewer, wontons, etc. it's huge & definitely enough to fill most people! not us! we next had shrimp fried rice & a hunan shrimp dinner. after the pu pu platter, we shared the dinner & rice! they did the hunan shrimp at a medium heat, good thing since tom can't handle heat like he used to! eat in, take out. either way, go! worth the trip!"}
{"text":"One word: DISGUSTING I just moved to the area and I was looking for a Chinese restaurant that would provide good food that I used to get back near my old place.  This place is in desperate need of some deep cleaning! I was a little weary of the condition of the restaurant being an indication of how my take out order would taste once I got it home. Boy was I right! The food was bland, not at all how general taos should taste. I was extremely disappointed but grateful I didn't end up sick, which is what I was expecting once I saw how neglectful of their cleaning regimens they have obviously been. There are much better places in the area. If I could give this place zero stars, I would have."}
