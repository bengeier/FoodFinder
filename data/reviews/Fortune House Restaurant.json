{"text":"This is a small restaurant but the food is amazing. Price is also amazing. Since there isn't as many tables if you dine in either come at an earlier time or make reservations, otherwise expect to wait awhile to get a table. But once seated they are super fast at getting the dishes out.  **They have the best sweet and sour pork I've ever tried!! Yumm"}
{"text":"My parents love this restaurant so even though it is a bit of a distance from our house (about 30 min drive) they still come here once a week. Once in a while we join them for seafood dinners, their lobsters crabs and fish are quite fresh, prices are reasonable. My favourite is their house specialty chicken, I order it every time! Even their plain white rice is better than most other restaurants. Their non-seafood dishes are also up to standard and most of the things we've tried have not disappointed. Service is prompt, they know my parents well so we get pretty good service and perks like special desserts, etc. The place is clean. It's not upscale in its decor, but in my opinion it doesn't need to be. The food (esp. seafood) is the focus here and they do it well. Seafood dinner for five people usually comes to about $80-$90, and we leave full, happy, and satisfied every time. It looks unassuming from the outside, but it's a hidden gem and has a group of loyal customers. Would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Came here at 10am for dim sum on a Friday morning. Full of seniors from the residence nearby who were regulars so me and my boyfriend got lower priority. They have the usual dim sum collection and was inexpensive. Have no complaints on the food. Service was handled by one waiter and the owners wife so it was very hard to get their attention... And they always kept their head down!"}
{"text":"Absolutely filthy restaurant which is uninviting in every way possible.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Great value. Delicious food. Really fresh seafood at great price. I always order their famous sweet sour pork, fresh steamed clams with garlic and vermicelli, free range chicken (house specialty), and large lobster stir fry with green onion and ginger.  This is a family style restaurant, not for romantic dates. You're here purely for the food. Service is ok, sometimes can be rude like any other Chinese restaurant. Crazy, bustling environment, waiters shouting and running around. You get the idea.  Tip: Make reservations!"}
{"text":"My grandpa loves this place - it's like \"Cheers\" for him where everyone there knows his name! I went last night with my extended family (10 of us) and didn't have a reservation - and my grandpa wasn't there yet. I didn't think to make a reso (my bad) and when I asked for a table of 10, they kind of looked at me funny but then quickly made up a table for us! Also, they serve the best Chinese style lobster in the city! Unfortunately, they overcharged us - billed us for something they ran out of, but my gramps caught that right away and had them correct it.  It's not a fancy place by any sort, but it certainly hits the spot when you're hungry."}
{"text":"The only reason why I end up in this place is because my parents knows the owner and because it's the closest Chinese restaurant in my area. To be honest, I don't like Chinese food - give me a burger and I'll be the happiest clam in the ocean but unfortunately, I'm forced to come here. It's seriously your typical Chinese restaurant with a huge selection of food which you can pick from those signs plastered all over their walls. I suppose it's decent for what you pay for but sometimes I have the urge to run over next door to grab come Mexican or Jerk Chicken..   I would come back here because... I don't have a choice."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant I have ever been to. The food is wonderful, great portion size, inexpensive and great quality. I have been going there for a couple of years even though it is about 45 minutes drive from my home. The staff are great and very attentive. You MUST try it."}
{"text":"I said it once and I'll say it again. One of the best Chinese restaurants there is. Only my 3rd yelp review and 2nd post just on this restaurant alone. Yes prices went up a bit since years past. Yes it's not as extravagant or the decor aren't fancy as like other pretentious places. But quality and taste are consistent and probably better than these fancier and more expensive establishments. Also low on the MSG scale for Chinese restaurant standards. Warning, if you're expecting first class service or pretty decoration then this isn't your place. But if you're looking for good tasting, fairly priced Chinese food and don't care much for the ambiance then this is your place. And the food comes out faster than waiting for your order at any Macdonald's near you..."}
{"text":"Solid, amazing value Chinese food.  Typical of Cantonese cuisine, there's a lot of variety, grease galore and flavours that dance on your tongue and that also leaves your mouth begging for copious amounts of tea to quench the subsequent thirst associated with the consumption of salt and spices.    It seems to be the local neighbourhood Chinese family dining hangout located in a suburban plaza.  Come prime meal times, the place is packed and the waiting crowd spills out the door.  Service is fast, and because we're there so much the waiters know us by now.  Make reservations if you've got a group coming, otherwise, it's quite the wait.  This type of Chinese food is like restaurant comfort food for me.  I leave with my fat cells well greased with deliciousness."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly fairly good! My family doesn't frequent sit-down Chinese restaurants because we find more value from food court prices/meals, especially when we're just eating alone. But for some reason, we ended up here a few nights ago and well, I was honestly pretty satisfied with my experience.  All of the dishes that we ordered were flavourful and really captured the \"stir-fry wok\" aroma. The textures were all as they should be and everything came pipping hot! Service was good and we really didn't come across any problems throughout our time here. Notably, I was really surprised that they gave us black sesame soup for dessert. That's usually a more expensive/classy dessert than the standard red bean soup so I was really happy about that. It tasted great too!   The prices, which I had already anticipated would be more expensive than regular, weren't too outrageous. I wouldn't come back on a regular basis, since that's just not how my family rolls, but I would definitely be back for when I'm with larger parties and looking for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Very busy during special dates in the Chinese culture, so make sure to book reservations in advance! Waiting times are normally long but trust me, it is worth because the food is amazing.   This is the regular Chinese restaurant my family goes since it's just a couple blocks away. It is nice and small and each dish is filled with mouth watering taste. Not to mention, their amazing price and cheap alcohol. Good place to go late at night with your best friend and have some nice Chinese food and a beer.   Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"I, personally, like coming to this restaurant because I like their food. Although my parents say they're slightly overpriced, but I like the ambience of this place. We come here quite a bit as well, so my parents know the menu and some of the workers here :) . However, try not to sit near the door if it's winter because the cold seeps in quite easily.  As usual, we get started off with a complimentary Chinese soup. The soup consists of carrots, herbs, and meat which were chewy and easily shredded from the bone. It was warm and yummy to start off our meal!"}
{"text":"Typical Hong Kong style Chinese restaurant. The outside looks a bit run down but when you walk into the place, it looks much nicer. Food is good and on a par with other Cantonese restaurants. Their specialty is seafood just like Maple Yip on Sheppard Ave.  Service: they gave the two of us one set of menus. It seemed a lot of restaurants do this, even when it's not busy with customers. I just don't understand why... It was difficult to get the servers' attention as well.  I can take the ambivalent service but here is the huge turnoff: they do NOT indicate what dishes are spicy on their subsidiary menu (not the main one). We unfortunately ordered one of the spicy dishes (fried udon with chicken). Wow it was HOT and I am not a fan of spicy food (almost a dealbreaker for me). Bad thing was we were not able to tell that by reading the dish name (either in Chinese or English). Why not be a bit more considerate and mark a little chili sign beside all your spicy dishes on the menu?  I may go back as I really don't dislike this place. However I hope they will pay attention to these details, even though they seem to have quite a few regulars already.  Debit is accepted."}
{"text":"When I got in and sat down, I actually felt as if I went back to Southern China eating at an old-school restaurant.  The place was full but not line-up full even on a Holiday.  We got there early waiting for a couple friends which is normal.  The waitress looked anxious and IMPATIENT for us to make our order which is normal attitude expected elsewhere but not normal in Toronto and nowadays not even acceptable in Southern China.  By the time other friends joined us, we were SWEATING up a storm and notified the staff who seemed to quickly agree and moved on.  Super heated that when we finish our meal, going outside to the 25 degree weather outdoors seemed like NORTH POLE.  Another resemblance to Chinese Old-School is that we saw FLIES doing there usual rounds near the windows while the Fruit Flies preferred the Tea Cups.  Last but not least, the Food was amazingly INEXPENSIVE as we ordered from a decent-sized Special Menu with pricing from $5.99 and $6.99 while the regular menu had a bit higher prices but still very reasonable.  Some of the factors definitely make it hard for me to be a REPEAT customer even when the VALUE of the food is so good.  I mean it's by no means the only Chinese restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"The food was quite standard for a Chinese restaurant. I'm really not sure what more I can say.  We ordered:  Steamed rice with pork ribs - came with small chunks of sweet potato, if I'm not mistaken.  Steamed rice with chicken and mushrooms - did not try.  Stir fried snow pea shoots with garlic - good portion, and the snow pea shoots were fresh and not stringy.   2 orders of steamed shrimp - I think they were $3.99 a plate, and there were at least 10 shrimp on each plate. Steamed without seasoning, these still have their heads on and their shells on. The best part is the head. You take it off the shrimp and suck the insides out. It's lovely and shrimpy. The shrimp were fresh and quite sweet.  Shredded pork chow mein - Decent. Had some crispy pieces. Good portion.  Preserved meat stir fried glutinous rice - if I didn't know this was glutinous rice, I would have never guessed. Not brown enough, not sticky enough, and not enough preserved meat to give it flavor.  Sweet and sour pork - decent amount of pork to veggies. Pork was done right. Outside was crispy. Inside wasn't dry. Sauce was the right balance of sweet to sour.  My one complaint was that it was freezing cold inside the restaurant yesterday. There's a problem if it's like 3-4 degrees Celsius outside and it's warmer outside than it is inside. I didn't want to take off my coat.   On the upside, they were open for Good Friday (Happy Easter, everyone! Jesus loves you!) and they let our party of 12 walk in."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night. Not as busy and no line up! I don't live in the area anymore, but there would always be lineups! The restaurant is quite small, and the decor is your typical Chinese restaurant, but the food is always consistent. My favourite here is the Sweet and Sour Pork. Unlike other Chinese restaurants that mostly serve bits of meat and batter, the pieces are big here and the flavour is really good. There portions are bigger here too, and although service may be a hit or a miss sometimes, the food and price makes up for it."}
{"text":"Compare happy time restaurant on old kenndy, this place is sooo much better. First of all msg is much much lower then common Chinese food restaurant. Quality of food is decide . I would recommend this place.  Purchasing of the restaurant was pretty reasonable. Only loss with the star rating as we discovered a hair in the stirfry vegetables there for the waiter was informed and they apologized and replace the dish. When replacement came the portion in the dish is less then the original"}
{"text":"I dined at Fortune House many times before my Yelp time.  I liked it previously because of the wok air and the low prices.  A friend of mine called it his \"canteen\".  I would have rated it 4 stars before.  I revisited lately.  Food tasted good.  You won't be disappointed with any dish you order.  The wok air was the same.  The combo still represented good value, but a la carte didn't.  The prices had been increased quite a bit.  I can't call it an economical meal anymore, despite the venue looking that way.  Services remained the same, too.  Fortune House is now a 3 to 3.5 stars on my book (I can't decide which way)."}
{"text":"I went in late afternoon on a weekend, about 3pm, when the lunch crowd was gone and the staff was about to eat their own lunch meals. I couldn't really read the extensive Chinese menu so we picked from the limited English menu.   We got the satay chicken with rice noodles and the beef brisket noodle soup. Both came within 5 minutes. The satay chicken plate was HUGE. But it was really oily and didn't have much flavour. The beef noodle soup also had tons of oil rings circling on top and of the 4 pieces of beef, 2 were really hard to chew.   The service was super fast but the servers were unfriendly and didn't really care about us. The food was mediocre and wasn't really good. Now that I'm reading the other reviews, it seems like the Chinese menu that we couldn't read offers the good food. If I ever go back, I'm bringing someone who can read Chinese."}
{"text":"Pros: Food comes out lightning quick Fairly good prices  Cons: Lots of menu items only in Chinese  I enjoy coming to these little unassuming Chinese restaurants.  It's a great choice for family dinners over the weekends.  Fortune House fits the bill for your standard Chinese restaurant: Good food at a fairly good price.  Like most Chinese restaurants, this place is busy on a Sunday night.  We came in to a full house but the turnover is rather quick so we were seated in less than 10 minutes.  The restaurant is not overly large, but they manage to fit a good amount of tables inside.    So there are 3 menus available here.  There's a paper one with English names on the dishes.  There's a laminated one with only Chinese.  Finally, the walls area lined with coloured paper with dishes (a Chinese restaurant standard) again, only in Chinese. I'm always going to be against Chinese only menus here in Canada.  I understand the items on the wall, but a good amount of dishes here are only listed in Chinese.  Having said all that, we ordered 4 dishes because we wanted to take some for lunch the next day.  The food comes out ultra lighting fast.  It was the fastest I think I've ever experienced.  Within 5 minutes of ordering, we had all our dishes.  It almost makes you feel like something is wrong. This has to be the main reason for the quick turnover they have. The food though was very good and alleviated any uneasy feelings I had immediately.  Orders come with free soup and dessert as well which is nice.  I like this place.  I tend to like these types of Chinese restaurants over the larger chains.  I definitely see myself coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced, reasonable portions and they serve complimentary soup and complimentary dessert :)  Really like their yellow chicken and the better melon dish.. The sweet and sour pork tastes a bit off from what I enjoy.   Service is good but I went when there weren't many people so I don't know what it's like during peak times. On the same note the food came very very quick like within 5-10 minutes all the dishes were on the table"}
{"text":"This is definitely an old-school place for Chinese family dinners and banquets. The food is cheap, the portions are large, the service is fast, and the flavours are all there. The older Asians who love this place are not here for a \"dining experience\" or for exquisite food. They're simply here to enjoy traditional delicious Cantonese dishes stir-fried in a highly heated wok for a good price - including seafood, like lobsters and fish.   You can be here with 14 people and 10 courses and LITERALLY be in and out under 30 minutes (although I think you need to call them ahead of time to let them know what you want).  This is a traditional Cantonese cheap eats family restaurants for hanging out with large group of friends or families you rarely see. To be fair, there are a large number of these types of restaurants all across toronto, but out of the few I have tried, this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"I don't know what's with some of the negative reviews.  Was this restaurant the greatest chinese restuaurant ever?  No.  There are tons of restaurants in the area.  But Fortune House is pretty good.  The prices are reasonable, they give complimentary soup and I liked their food.  The portions were pretty good also.  I came here with my folks and whole bunch of my dad's brothers and sisters.  Lots of older chinese people who know good chinese food.  Everyone seemed to enjoy and it was affordable for such a large group.  I think Fortune House is a pretty good place and will come back again."}
{"text":"If you're nearby: 4 If you're not: 3 Overall: 3.5  I've been eating here for years so I'm a bit biased. This place is good value for the money, but don't let that scare you: I think the food is pretty good too. It's Cantonese style food with tons of extra menu items on the walls (all in Chinese though). I'm not too sure about ordering any fresh seafood because those tanks look pretty dirty. Decor and service are meh, but that's to be expected from a hole-in-the-wall place at this price. Other than the food, I like how close this is to me (so you may not necessarily value that as much) and how fast the food is (because the last thing I want to do is go to a nearby restaurant just to wait forever to eat). Overall I'd recommend it to locals only for those reasons."}
{"text":"The decor is pretty old school so i was thrown off when my food arrived....it was pretty good! Really good value for money as well.  also, my kids absolutely loved the shanghai fried noodles (good wok air as mentioned in other reviews) and the portions were big enough the three of us shared two dishes over lunch and was unable to finish all the food.    i'd come back if i wanted a quick simple canto meal at a really good price."}
{"text":"i never seen food come out so fast in my life... we made orders and it seemed almost premade... i came on the chinese new year day and it was quite packed.    ordered 4-5 dishes and they all came out faster than mcdonalds.  It was crazy.  i will garantee you if you go at dinner.. you will see a roundish bald headed dude wearing a light blue dress shirt tucked in...  please observe and post your pics next time."}
