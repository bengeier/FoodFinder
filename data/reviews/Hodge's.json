{"text":"It's not too often that you order a burger and end up with a three course meal.  It's even less often that all three of those courses turn out to be good!

On a course-by-course basis;

The tater tots were tasty; light, fluffy, and delicious with the accompanying aioli.

The signature Hodge Burger was good, but not great.  The ingredients went well together, but the overall experience wasn't one that has stuck with me.  It was certainly well above average, but not outstanding, and not something I would go out of my way to sample.  The kitchen did cook the meat perfectly, which was a plus.

The cornbread was INCREDIBLE.  I don't particularly like cornbread; it's never been my thing.  I generally avoid it if I can.  But the cornbread at Hodge's- it's to die for, especially with the maple bourbon butter.  OH MY GOD.

I would bring a companion here just so I could watch their face as they have the joy of sampling the cornbread for the first time."}
{"text":"Started with an excellent cocktail recommendation -the Creole- and just got better. Pork cutlet on pappardelle alfredo was perfect, with asparagus grilled just right.  The skillet cornbread is among the best I've eve had. Partner's ravioli was just ok.  Thoughtful, easy-going service.   Decent wine list.  A throughly enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"One word - Fantastic
O.K, two - Absolutely Fantastic.
I first met Chris a couple years ago sitting next to me at the Winking Lizard - he was just about to launch the Dim and Den Sum truck at the time.  Our conversation led me to almost instantly recognize that I was sitting with a truly passionate professional and that his star would be one to follow.  To the truck I did and it was Great; now, Hodges is phenomenal.
On a brief visit last evening the Swedish Meatball app was silky, perfectly textured and seasoned - a treat.  The pork chop was in the class of one of  'the best foods I  have ever eaten'. 
The staff is truly professional - it was nice to see a friendly face behind the bar - Juan (Snowballito).
On the downside - the sparkling bathroom is remote, but again the staff makes up for it - and almost holds your hand to make sure you find the circuitous path there and back.  Regulars will adjust.  
Congratulations Chris - see you soon."}
{"text":"Food has always been very good, but disappointed that the cornbread is not available for lunch. I've ordered it during lunch in prior visits, so not sure why it's no longer being offered. I would have been happy to even pay extra for an order."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight for my mom's birthday and it was delicious. The meal started with complimentary tater tots with a malt vinegar aioli. They were crisp with creamy centers. These are not Ore  Ida! The malt vinegar  aioli was to die for. I would love that for fish.

We followed that with the goat cheese and leek tart. Yummy. It was served with sweet onion jam. I could have eaten a trough of that and the tart was tangy and rich. Really wonderful.

Next came the complimentary cornbread with maple bourbon butter. I am not a fan of cornbread but this is by far the best cornbread I have ever had and the butter was great.

I had the hanger steak. The salsa verde was really nice and meat was cooked to perfection. I ordered medium rare and it came out with a great char and a red center. Perfect and delish. It came with green beans dressed with a tomato vinaigrette. They were a bit crisp. I am a fan of tender crisp veggies, but these could have been a tad more tender. The dressing was really good. The fingerling potatoes were okay, but nothing special. Could have used a bit more seasoning.

My mother had the Ham Shank with a root beer glaze. OMG! I highly recommend this dish. The glaze is sooo good and the ham falls off the bone. It's a big portion and she took half home.

My sister had the short ribs with potato puree. I didn't taste hers, but she said they were very good and she loved the potato puree.

The atmosphere is really warm and inviting. We had terrific service. Thanks Robin!"}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere, but the food is not up to par with the other big name chefs in the city. My wife ordered the burger (medium) it came extra we'll done, not even edible. I had the skirt steak and it want anything special. We really liked the atmosphere, just wish we liked the food. Won't be back anytime soon.."}
{"text":"Food was average at best and definitely over priced. Menu is very limited and it seems that they are trying too hard to be a high end restaurant when they might be a better fit as a pup style restaurant. Service was also very poor."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  The food took over 30 mins to come out and that was at lunch.  The patio only had 3 other tables seated.  We work downtown and didn't really plan on 1.5 hour lunch.  Food was served without utensils (after our long wait) and the salads had no dressing.  The $14 shrimp and grits was flavorless and had THREE small shrimp.  Seriously?  I finished the tiny portion in about 2 minutes.   They were also out of the salmon, which 3 people planned to order.  The manager was non-chalant when we complained about the poor service.  The bill was adjusted (slightly) but he never came back to apologize.  Just seemed very indifferent.  6 of us went...none of us will return."}
{"text":"Went to Hodge's this past weekend when I was in Cleveland visiting friends. Overall, I really enjoyed the restaurant. My husband and I split the devils on horseback and hushpuppies for appetizers and both were delicious! I had the fried chicken sandwich and he had the CAB burger and I enjoyed both quite a bit (he was not a fan of the onion jam on the burger, but I thought it was good!). The location is a bit odd as it appears to be in some kind of mixed-use space, but I would visit again."}
{"text":"We were walking down Euclid Ave. on a warm November day and stumbled upon Hodges.  It is tucked back in the corner of an apartment building right before you get to East 4th St.  The day was going well, we hiked through the Cuyahoga Valley in the morning. Had a wonderful brunch with friends and family.  Enjoyed the Steelers beating up on the Browns and we still had tickets to the Broadway Musical, A gentlemen's guide to love and murder.  We had just enough time for a drink and some appetizers.  I think I have digressed,  back to Hodges, we walked in and  were greeted by a friendly hostess who gave us our choice of seating.  We chose the bar and had a window view.  Our bartender/waitress, Breanna, immediately said hello and was perfect with her recommendations, the wife had red wine and I had a Moscow mule.  We decided on the blue crab hush puppies, Swedish chicken balls and potstickers.  Everything was perfect.  Whoever put the menu together is a culinary genius!  I have a feeling that everything on the menu is just as amazing as what we had.  They have all day happy hour, which made us pretty happy.  Breanna was awesome and we will be back in two weeks when we return to playhouse square........"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We went with a group of 4 people for lunch and none of us were pleased. I got the salmon and the portion size was laughable, especially for the price. The flavor was good and it was cooked well but I needed to eat immediately after. Some appetizers have good flavor as well but again, way too small. By no means was it the worst meal I have ever eaten but I definitely will not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I went to this place based on the reviews. Well, they no longer give out the cornbread. It's on the menu for $5. I didn't try it. They also no longer have the brown butter fettuccine. I asked the waitress and she didn't know what I was talking about. I ordered the tortellini alfredo. It was ok. About on par with the Olive Garden. I also ordered a side of baby carrots. They were the biggest baby carrots I've ever seen and were not seasoned at all. They were just boiled and didn't even have butter on them. As someone else said, with Lola around the corner, there's no reason to go here."}
{"text":"Went here with 8 coworkers. Got seating within 15 minutes. The waiter was excellent his recommendations were spotted on. Excellent food. A little pricey but given the service and quality of the meal it was well worth it."}
{"text":"The food was good but service needs help. I never had a server before tell me that an item on the menu was not very good, and when we tried to get coffee he advised the place around the corner saying the coffee at the restaurant was terrible. On second thought maybe i should thank him for his honesty."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for our entrees on Saturday night. We arrived at 5:45 and ordered within 5 minutes. Our appetisers and drinks came 45 minutes later. Entrees came 35 minutes later. When we asked where our food was, they replied sorry everyone came at the same time. Sorry but it's called dinner time. Food was alright. Would not come back due to service issues. They need to learn how to deal with dinner rush on the night of a Cavs game."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the experience and would go back.

The menu is creative and in addition taste good. My relish under my rib appetizer was a nice blend of cabbage and raisins. The wine list was a good match for the food. The surrounding are noisy but acceptable. We sat in a rooms separated from the bar. The service was slow but the restuarant ahd only been open a few weeks."}
{"text":"Easily the best Resturant in Cleveland. The food is unbelievable. Also, the price is just right. Many of the other restaurant within walking distance are nice but lacks one thing or another. Hodges is the total package. Try the mussels as an appetizer. The burgers have been perfect each time!   You will be pleased, trust me ;)"}
{"text":"I went during lunch so the menu was limited but the cabb burger that I ordered was cooked as I requested, tots and the spicy aioli was the best. Definitely will return for dinner."}
{"text":"We went to Hodges a few weeks ago.  I was really looking forward to it because I had heard a lot of good things.  We sat at the bar and the service was not good.  There were two bartenders on duty, it was early, @ 5:00 on a Saturday.  Took our drink orders right away, we asked for menus to order some appetizers and it took an extremely long time for the bartender to return to take our order. The menu listed tater tots animal style, so we asked for those and the hanky pankies.  He brought us plain tater tots, we were not aware we were ordering something different from on the menu.  Disappointing that he didn't clarify.  They were fine and the hanky pankies were good.  Also took an extremely long time to get our check.  The bartenders weren't busy with customers, just busy talking.  Another friend had gone in shortly before that and sat at the bar, ended up leaving because they wouldn't wait on her.  She had to holler from across the bar to the server to get his attention, and he was not very pleasant.  
I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Great food. Retro bar very good service. Took scans fe of the Tuesday. 2 for $40. Shrimp and grits. Very creamy and good. Oh my Mac n cheese was the b e s t. My husband had the chicken which was very moist and literally fell off the bone. Very good waiter. Great food and service"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 and we all ordered a different dish so we could share. Everything was excellent. My favorite was the chicken. Even their desserts were terrific."}
{"text":"I had the rock shrimp Po boy and it was was pretty good, nothing spectacular but I enjoyed it. Unfortunately, two of my party had to send back their plates back and staff seemed pretty annoyed that their food was not to their expectations even after they explained their problem (flat bread was not crisp and tasted doughy). Great atmosphere however, the restaurant appeared very short staffed for Friday night and staff was kind of annoyed and flustered trying to keep up. After all the great reviews I read and I chose this restaurant for a dinner night out with the girls, I felt kind of let down by Hodges."}
{"text":"Amazing cornbread!! Perfect burger and tots! Sat outside and was great weather! Great wait staff. Would eat their again."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit Hodge's for some time now, and it did live up to my expectations. Really awesome atmosphere, I really like the red color scheme, and the chairs are super comfy!

For an appetizer we ordered the Canadian Tots. They came in quite a surprisingly large portion-a very welcome surprise, they were awesome! Cheese curds, and bacon, and pork gravy, mmmm! Really delicious.

They have a great deal at lunch called the Lunchbox for just $13 bucks! You get your choice of soup, salad, and half a sandwich! I pay close to this price at Panera for just half a sandwich and half a salad of much lesser quality!

I had the beer cheese soup-excellent! The Caesar salad-pretty good! I even ate the anchovies, something I've never done. And the PBLT (pulled pork, bacon, lettuce and tomato)-pretty good! I wish this was a little saucier, but was great when I dipped it in my soup.

The bill came in a little red envelope that read, \"The Damage.\" Really nice, original touch!

Overall, a great lunch spot Downtown. I look forward to trying dinner here!"}
{"text":"First time in...

The good:  The food is better than expected.  We did \"heavy apps\"  prior to a night out... the \"Swedish Meatballs\" hit the spot with their rich sauce.

The Huh?:  No cornbread for my table... I guess my group wasn't hipster enough or something.  A bit spendy for what is was... food seemed to be priced OK, but drinks must have been priced a buck or two above market.

I enjoyed the visit and would return if someone requested it, but there are walking-distance alternatives that offer better (Chinato, Greenhouse, Pura Vida)."}
{"text":"Tl/dr: for the price I expect much better, also they charge $2 for ice.

Hodges is the kind of place I really want to love but just can't bring myself to do so. The place itself is very cozy, staff is generally friendly and location is great. 

However, the food is lackluster and somewhat confusing. The deviled eggs taste strongly of vinegar. The Mac and cheese is bizarrely sweet. The meatballs were decent, but tepid... and the list goes on. I've never had anything to eat that was overtly offensive but everything I have had was no more than mediocre, especially given the price point.

The kicker for me was an un-advertised $2 up-charge on every drink for ice. So yeah, your $7 bullet is magically $9 if you order it \"on the rocks.\" Is that even a thing? Add in the waitress being extra rude when I asked about it, and I see no reason to ever return."}
{"text":"I have to share my terrible experience with Hodge's tonight. We ordered two burgers, beer cheddar soup, brussel sprouts, and a side of macaroni and cheese to go. The person who took the order did not inform me that the half price burger special only applied when dining in the restaurant, nor does it mention this in the daily specials section of the site. When we opened our order at home, we were very disappointed to realize that there were a meager 5 sprouts in the container, half a portion of soup and no accompanying pretzels. I called the restaurant to tell them about this. The young lady who took my call put me on hold and finally returned 10 minutes later to tell me that I had been credited for these two items. I mentioned that the buns were supposed to be pretzel buns for the burgers. I told her that I saw this on their Open Table menu and she said it was changed, she mentioned the credit and basically hung up on me. Okay...so I am finally sitting down at this point to eat my now cold dinner and bite into what can only be described as a raw burger, not medium as I ordered. My husband's burger was supposed to be well done and his was equally as pink. We had to MICROWAVE them to finish cooking them to make them even edible. Finally after finishing this lousy burger, I heat up the cold cheddar soup. It tasted so bad that I could not even eat it. Tonight was my birthday and I chose to get take out from Hodge's as my dinner. It was a lousy, terrible dinner. I am very disappointed by all of this and plan to make sure that family and friends know of my lousy meal and experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Nice and cozy place. Overpriced beers (not disclosed before the check)... More than $10 for a small local IPA! Service ok. I guess I got disappointed with lack of information on some prices."}
{"text":"On a random Saturday a girlfriend and I decided to see what Hodge's was all about. We had an average length wait, and were seated beside an intensely rowdy table (a 21st birthday, it seemed). The table was obnoxious and we were looking for something more lowkey. We asked our server to relocate us and without any fuss or fanfare, we were moved to a more quiet area and the manager came over to apologize. Completely unnecessary but genuinely thoughtful and appreciated. The staff was wonderful! It speaks to the restaurant's customer service training that a manager would go out of his way to come speak to us over something so small; we just wanted a more quiet area- not a big deal at all.

The cornbread was the best cornbread I've ever eaten, and that includes Paula Dean's in Savannah, Georgia. I can't explain it other than it's the most delicious and perfect bread I've ever consumed. The macaroni and cheese couldn't be more rich and amazing. The pork cutlet was delicate, juicy, and filled with flavor. Everything was well crafted and delicious and I'll definitely be back. 

The only odd thing is that you have to exit the restaurant to use the restroom, and sort of trek through an apartment complex. It's a small price to pay for a great restaurant though."}
{"text":"Cool place for happy hour.  Bar food was OK.  Pork skins were disappointing.  Seemed pulled from the snack aisle.  Not fresh.  Overall cool vibe."}
{"text":"Hodge's is awesome. The food is very unique and is so, so, so delicious. The cocktail list was more than I could have dreamed! Honey + whiskey + elderflower liquor shaken up in a mason jar at the table? Little cast iron skillets of fresh cornbread with whipped maple-bourbon butter? A great playlist packed with the black keys, the shins and mgmt? Yes, please. 
My fiance and I were there on opening night - so it was fairly busy, but the service was great.  Knowledgeable, friendly staff.
It's a little expensive for the college student budget but totally worth it - especially for a special occasion. I'm looking forward to warmer weather so we can enjoy the patio. 
Bottom line: Get to Hodge's as soon as you can."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a 5-star person... BUT this place was perfect for my moment. We wanted a delicious 2-drink lunch on a Thursday and this did it!!! My food was so on-point I gave a thumbs-up to the kitchen staff on my way out!"}
{"text":"went here yesterday (a tuesday) thinking we'd take advantage of the restaurant week special (3 course meal for $30 each with the option of adding a 3 oz sample of a different wine per course for an additional $15).  then we realized that the \"2 for $40\" deal that hodge's regularly offers each tuesday was a MUCH better deal!  you choose one appetizer to share, two entrees, and one bottle of wine for $40.  we each had a cup of the beer & tillamook cheddar cheese soup topped w/ sourdough croutons- really really good!  but it's hard to mess up beer cheese soup.  then our waitress brought us a complimentary corn bread skillet with maple butter that was amazing.  then i had the skirt steak with polenta and my s.o. had the salmon.  we chose a bottle of pinot grigio (your wine options are limited- i think you could have a cab, a pinot grigio, or a chardonnay).  the wine was okay but nothing incredible.  i think the label said vista point.  it gave us both a little acid reflux after dinner as we power walked back to our car in the snow.  overall really happy we came in, and will do a 2 for $40 tuesday dinner here again.  will prob get the cab next time."}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time for their happy hour.

I ended up having three drinks, an app and a small plate. My bill was $30 including a healthy tip.  I'm a fan.

Not only was it cheap, it was actually delicious. For a drink I had the rum punch which was really delightful and not too sweet, although I did have 3 and didn't feel a buzz. For an app I had their tots and aioli, which was seasoned nicely. The real treat for the night was the duck confit flatbread. The flatbread had more duck meat on it than I expected which was nice and the flavors of the fig and cheese accompanied it nicely. I'm not a huge fan of crust on pizza or flatbreads, but I ate it and loved it!"}
{"text":"Cool place with very friendly staff. Food was amazing. I had the scallops risotto and hubby had the chicken schnitzel both dishes were very tasty. We also had the devil eggs and liver pate, excellent as well. 
You are also given skillet corn bread to start. Yummmmy"}
{"text":"Wowza, this place is fantastic. First of all let me just say it is the mortar and brick sister to it's two food trucks Hodge Podge and Dim and Dem Sum... which are hugely popular in the Cleveland area, and the restaurant I feel is also just as good.  It's a tad off the beaten path, luckily there's a larger sign by the road and side walk otherwise it could be very easily missed.

Went on Twofer Tuesday (special 1 ap, 2 entrees and a bottle of wine for 40), which we took advantage of. The app we chose was Korean Fried chicken (so so yum) and had complimentary sweet potato tat or tots from the EXCELLENT chef. Let me say now, the corn bread.... if I could chose to eat only one thing for the rest of my life I really think it would be that fantastic corn bread. The food that we chose was great as well (6 Veg and Salmon).  My husband would like to add his \"mmmmmmmmmm\" in description.

Worth a try if you're downtown and on Euclid looking for a place to eat."}
{"text":"My friends and I were extremely excited to try Hodge's because it was a place none of us had been to. We had heard great things about the chef and figured it would be nice place for a birthday gathering. Unfortunately, the customer service of not only the hostesses and the wait staff made for a poor atmosphere.

The hostesses argued with me about my reservation of more than 10 people claiming the time was wrong and that they had seated another party. It was not until someone who I assume was a manager walked over that they offered to set another table for our party. It felt like they were turning us away instead of trying to be accommodating. Our waiter was also extremely unattentive and seemed almost annoyed that he had such a large party to deal with. I could understand if the restaurant was very busy, but on a Saturday night with open tables the server could have done a better job.

As for the food, the Korean fried chicken was delicious as well as the sweet potato tater tots and the cornbread. My entree was the scallops which were cooked perfectly beside the fact that they were super salty. The rest of the party enjoyed their meals (Hodge burger, chicken, stuffed banana peppers, Hodge ceasar salad). The birthday dessert was phenomenal as well. Dark chocolate over a hot brownie. AMAZING. 

Unfortunately, the service and the attitude of the staff really deterred from an otherwise pleasant meal. It would not be on the top of my list for places to visit again. No matter how excellent the food is, if you don't feel welcome coming in the door you are not going to return."}
{"text":"We went last night for restaurant week, and I found this place to be just above average. 

THE LOCATION AND DECOR (ONE STAR): From the pictures I'd seen online, I was expecting more of a sports bar. The decor is attempting a more rustic interior, but everything looks too manufactured to be authentic. The layout is nice, but there is this odd extra room in the back, I assume to expand the amount of seating, but we were sitting near the entrance to it and it was out of place. I think the room is there and everything seems so fake because the location is TERRIBLE. It's in the back of the first floor of one of those \"luxury\" apartment buildings where everything is immaculate but it makes you feel really unsettled. One member of our party also stepped in the poop of one of the spoiled, sorority-sweatshirt-wearing resident's fake dogs on the way out. So that was awesome...

THE FOOD (FOUR STARS): So, I'm from out of town and not familiar with the food trucks other reviewers mentioned. What struck me as soon as we walked in was all the advertisements for all the other restaurants in the chain. There were multiple advertisements for their \"passport\" and all the other restaurants you should go to. Tacky. I wanted to eat the food here, not wonder if the chef/owner/whatever sold out (now I'm rethinking the decor...). Anyway. The food was really good. It was four stars, maybe five, but the rest of the elements of the restaurant bring it down. My boyfriend ordered off the menu, the rest of us had restaurant week meals. The restaurant week meals were fantastic. My boyfriend was disappointed by his short ribs. The tater tots and sauce were great. The cornbread was really cakey. Like, really cakey. I wouldn't be surprised if the cornbread was actually made with a box of yellow cake mix and a box of that cornbread Jiffy mix. The drinks were great, I love the consideration of using a giant ice cube so it doesn't water down the drink. 

THE SERVICE (TWO STARS): There was a ten-minute wait despite a reservation. The hostess seemed a little confused overall. A couple of us went to the bar after a couple minutes to order a drink and the bartenders (yes, more than one) practically ignored us. We waited for almost five minutes and didn't order a drink. At that point the hostess walked over and stared at us until we got up and followed her to our table. The whole thing was awkward. The bar wasn't busy, so I was pretty unimpressed before we even sat down to eat. Our waiter was really good. He was there when needed, but didn't interrupt the flow of the meal. There were a couple off moments where the service kind of fell apart, like, our table didn't have pepper, and he didn't offer us pepper for our salads (does the chef have something against pepper?). He wasn't on the ball with refills, etc. Nothing major.

OVERALL: I would love to eat that food again, but I'm not really interested in spending time, and a bunch of money, at a place that seems so corporate. If I liked that kind of vibe, I'd save a ton of money and just go to Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"I visited Hodge's last Tuesday for the 2 for $40 and am so happy I did! We were heading to a concert at HOB afterwards, and the restaurant had a good vibe for us beforehand. There were tons of seating and not a large dinner crowd, so we definitely did not need the reservations we made.

For the 2 for $40, you get an appetizer, 2 entrees, a tasty bottle of wine PLUS their complimentary corn bread. It was a crazy cheap price for the quality of the food! We were even able to take our unfinished bottle home, which I have def never done elsewhere.

Our waitress Robin was extremely friendly, interested, and professional. She folded my friend's napkin when he went to the bathroom, offered to keep the food under the lamp in the kitchen when one of my friends stepped out for a minute, and was all together a very attentive server. She definitely contributed to our positive experience there!

I looked around at the other restaurants in the area before booking our reservations here, and I am so happy with my decision. I'd def recommend Hodges to anyone, especially for the Tuesday night special!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Had drinks and apps at the bar last night -- we loved the food and the atmosphere! I definitely want to go back to experience the patio."}
{"text":"Crazy tasty appetizers, ordered devils on horseback, hanky-pankies, and goat cheese tart, all awesome.  Decent draught selection, cozy bar.  A good stop."}
{"text":"We had a 6pm reservation giving us an hour and 10 min to eat before out theater event.
We ordered within 5 min of sitting down. My friends soup arrived a half hour later followed by her appetizer...strange. 
We asked about our meals at 10 till 7 and we're told \"oh they are coming soon\" we let our server know we needed to go soon and could he please bring the check. 
We got our food and anticipated eating fast and leaving. I got the shrimp and grits...better sounding than reality. The grits were not seasoned, very bland and lumpy while the shrimp was over cooked. 
My friend order the Ohio Chicken...completely raw inside! We have both worked in restaurants and understand being busy...however a little planning and better chefs might help this place."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Lunch box special was great, the tomato bisque was excellent! The salad that comes with the lunch special is smaller than the average side salad but tasty, There was a lot of light and no wait time for a table for lunch."}
{"text":"The food was good but it was very strong flavors and had more of an acquired taste. The server was nice and pretty attentive, also I was in a big group and they did not add a gratuity and were able to split up our checks onto separate checks which was nice. The portions were small and overpriced in my opinion but overall the food was good."}
{"text":"The one star is for the Tatar tots, but how can you screw those up?! 

I got the burger, medium well. I received it about 40 minutes after ordering it was on game 6 of the World Series however my son and I were there at 4pm and one of the only diners inside. Back to the burger...I cut it in half, it was raw. I sent it back and got a very burnt burger. We were going to the Cavs game and by that time it was eat it or eat at the Q. I wouldn't go back for the burger, tots were good. 

My son got the chicken tenders and tots. The tenders came out w/ nearly blackened breading and his tots were good. 

I will say the unsweetened ice tea was amazing! 

I spent $36 w tip, the server was very nice and attentive however I wouldn't go back due to the quality of the food. They just couldn't seem to get it right tonight."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.

One of the best new fooderies in downtown Cleveland. We started with tuna poppers...can't resist the new takes on old themes...terrific flavor and crispiness.  Subtle complexities of flavor in the scallop entre, while options for larger portion in the pork chop offering.  Good use of seasonal vegies.  We had a lovely unoaked chardonney to accompany, and couldn't help but sample dessert, a lovely strawberry-basil crisp topped with local Mitchell's ice cream.   Great value for such innovative, delicious food!"}
{"text":"The food is quite good, especially the cornbread and burger.  If this review was solely based on that, it would be a solid 4 stars. Unfortunately, I have to downgrade because they served my husband the lobster whipped potatoes with his salmon even though we informed our waiter that he is allergic to shellfish. Our waiter write down regular mashed potatoes, but the kitchen apparently didn't read the order carefully. My husband broke out in a rash as soon as we got home. Thankfully, my husband's allergic reaction is limited to rashes only, but that is not the case for many people with food allergies.  Perhaps it's because they just opened and are still ironing out the wrinkles, but that is really no excuse for serving people food they are allergic to after being informed of those allergies."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week. Three courses for $30 along with a wine pairing for an additional $15. Service was ok, they were pretty busy. I'd skip the pairing but only because I wasn't a fan of the pino noir, not very complex for my palate. Cornbread was burnt on one side but what we salvaged was tasty! Started with the mushroom gnocchi which was amazing. Tasted the hanky panky from the trio which was tasty. Second course was the hanger steak which I ordered medium rare, which was a little too rare for me but I ate the more cooked part which was really good. Actually was better that way for leftovers. Dessert course I had the lemon tart with blueberry consommé. I'm not really big on sweets so it's probably not good for me to review them. I ate about a fourth of it, as it was too sweet for me. After dinner we went to the bar and it was under happy hour from 10 o'clock to 11 so we both ordered five dollar Moscow mules! on Tuesdays it looks like they have a special, two for $40 which includes one appetizer, an entrée, and a bottle wine to share. I will definitely be coming back for this special and happy hours in the future. All in all a great dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been to Hodge's three times now, and I would say it's hit or miss.  Sitting at the bar (once inside, once outside), the service has been slow.  The first time I was there, it was pretty busy, but regardless, it took more than 10 minutes for me to get a drink.  I was also never offered another drink.  When I sat outside, my friends were the only people at the bar.  It seemed that the bartender was more concerned with cleaning and getting ready for closing than with serving us.

When I sat at a table, service was better.  I had their burger which was very good, though overcooked from what I ordered.  I also think that pretty much everything here is overpriced.  Pricing should match either the fanciness/expense of the food, or the ambiance.  It doesn't match either here.  The decor of Hodge's is laid back, not somewhere you would bring a date after the theater, but those are the prices they charge.

Nothing terrible about this place, but nothing great either."}
{"text":"My short review is that Hodge's is my favorite place to eat in Cleveland. 

Initially, I came for more of the cuisine I've come to expect of anything Chris Hodgson is a part of. I've come back time and time again because the service ALWAYS goes above and beyond my expectations. Just when I think I've had everything on the menu, new seasonal items crop up that aren't to be missed. My review doesn't include one specific meal because there are week's where I've eaten there 3 or 4 times. That is about as high an enforcement as I can give."}
{"text":"I sure wish that 3rd time was the charm but it was not. After 2 prior sub par visits over the past couple years I tried again Sunday 7/2/17 with some out of town guests because it was a beautiful evening and Hodges has a beautiful patio. UGH!  Big mistake. Super embarrassed because I had bragged about the CLE food scene. 
There were only 2 other tables in the entire restaurant/patio. That's it 2 other tables!  It took a VERY LONG time to get our dinner and my arugula salad, a regular menu item was made with romain because they ran it of arugula!  How do you run out of the main ingredient of a menu item on a day when you have very few customers. The piece of salmon on my salad was over cooked and dry. My prior 2 visits were equally disappointing and both had poor kitchen service and underwhelming food."}
{"text":"We came to hodges at about 9pm on Saturday night. It was moderately busy and we were seated right away. Our waiter arrived within a minute or so & went over  the cocktail menu with us. For my first drink, I tried the prosecco spritz. It had a strong Meyer lemon flavor, but was just right. 

We ordered the fried oysters & deviled eggs as an appetizer. Let me preface this by saying that I hate seafood... Those oysters are one of my new favorite things! They had a sweet relish & a nice mustard sauce with them. Perfectly crunchy with they oyster still nice & juicy on the inside & not at all greasy. The deviled eggs were made with bacon aioli, sriacha, & chives. They were the perfect bite. After our apps, our waiter brought out the cutest skillet of cornbread with maple butter. We could have ended our meal there & been happy. 

For my second drink, I ordered the hodges punch. It was sweet, but had a fun fruity watermelon flavor & came in an adorable mason jar style glass. For dinner I had the hangar steak with creamed corn & fried onions. It was cooked perfectly & I was able to cut it with a butter knife. My fiancée had the salmon with fried rice & a pineapple habanero salsa. Both were fantastic. My fiancée said the salmon was some of the best he's ever had. The skin was still on & it was a nice sized filet. All of the flavors in the bowl worked together perfectly.  

For dessert we split the banana cream pie in a jar. It was worth leaving overstuffed! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Very tasty.  Get the loaded tots.  You will not be disappointed.  Had the lunchbox lunch with tomato bisque, Caesar salad and the crispy chicken salad.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"The patio is great...nice atmosphere.  I went for an early happy hour.  Got drinks with a couple of friends and some appetizers.  The bill came and nothing was \"happy hour\" price.  I had to request that my wings and calamari be discounted.  I asked for Bud Light which was to be $2 at HH and the server told me they only have Miller Lite.  He brought that, but failed to tell me it was $3.50 and in a large can...not $2.  I don't mind the extra cost, but don't try to pull it off as a $2 beer when it's not.  I was also charged for a round of drinks I never had.  That's $7 extra for a draft Troeggs and $3.50 for a Miller Lite.  Needless to say, the bill was completely wrong.  I was in a hurry to meet some other friends and when the bill came back the second time incorrect (the round of drinks was never taken off, but the two apps were adjusted), I just paid and left.  I called the restaurant the next day and spoke to a manager.  He was very apologetic and said he would credit my credit card or give me a credit for my next visit.  I gave him my check number and asked that he credited my account.  I trusted he would do so.  He said, \"We want to make things right.  I'll take care of you.\"  It's been a month and my credit card has never been credited.  Why should I have to ask for HH pricing when it's on the menu?  Why are you charging me for beers I did not have?  I had the feeling our server did not think we'd notice, which felt very dishonest to me.  I won't be back...too many other restaurants around.  If you go...watch your bill!"}
{"text":"Terrible service - waited 15 minutes for a server and 30 minutes for a drink - apps came out before the drink and were cold and gross!  Do not recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent. We are from out of town. It is nice to see such dedication to details. The food,
From the bread item, to the quality of the beverages were impressive."}
{"text":"Went here with another couple for dinner. We loved the \"snacks\" and tried the deviled eggs and hanky panky's, they were delicious. I got the beer cheese soup which was the best I have had and a Caesar salad with salmon. He got the salmon and our friends got the pork and hangar steak. Everyone had a clean plate except for me, and that was because I inhaled the soup. We only had two minor complaints, the first that it was extremely hot upstairs, we were fine as diners but I felt awful for the staff. Our other complaint was that they wanted $19 for a neat woodford reserve, that's insane! We will definitely be back for the food and the service but we will stick with the beer."}
{"text":"A large space with two levels, a full bar, and a fun, albeit schizophrenic feel to it. Sorta like a trendy gastropub set up inside a fireman's carnival. 

It was the fun stuff on the menu like lobster corn dogs that drew me to choose the place but in the end, I got a totally adult entree of duck breast, brussel sprouts, and \"black risotto.\" Very good all around. Friends with burgers were equally pleased as was the weirdo with the salad. 

Amuse bouche of bacon and cheese-sprinkled tater tots was appreciated for both flavor and irony."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for dinner when we were in Cleveland for a night on a trip cross country. First, the restaurant and bar have a great atmosphere. It was clean, very well done, hip and comfortable. It was a great place to duck into and get out if the hell hole streets of Cleveland. 

The general manager was awesome. He found us seats at the bar, introduced himself, and told us the cool story on how Hodges came to be. The menu was fun and inspiring. We immediately wanted to taste one of everything. We decided to try a few appetizers instead of ordering entrees. 

The bar was a fun place to hang, comfortable, great wine and beer menu, and they had the hockey game on. That said, the bar was overstaffed and confusing. There were 4 people waiting on us and all asking us if we were ready to order, even though we already had! We ordered the wedge salad, which was delicious, but one of the many bartenders served it to the people next to us! They didn't correct the error either. Those people asked us if the salad actually belonged to us and handed it over. Not that big of a deal, but it would've been nice if the bartender acknowledged the error and apologized...which he (or they) didn't! Also, it seemed everyone who was eating was served corn bread in a cute lodge pan, but this was not offered to us.

The menu has some interesting choices but each one we tried seemed to be missing a little something. We had the lobster corn dog dippers, which were a great idea but tasted a bit gritty and lackluster. The Swedish meatballs also were missing something. They were supposed to be served au poivre, but we just didn't taste it. The manager did say the head chef was off that evening, so maybe that would explain it.  We also tried the brussel sprouts, which were good and the bacon and \"baked beans\" where pine nuts were used in place of the traditional beans. My husband really liked that and thought it was tasty and interesting. 

We did really like the vibe and interesting menu and would definitely give the food another try. Unfortunately though, we will not be back to Cleveland anytime soon...another story but the city is a scary place! Perhaps Hodges would consider a move to Boston?"}
{"text":"Just in town for to catch an Indian's game. It was close to the hotel and definitely worth the walk. If I lived in Cleveland I would be a regular. I had the C. A. B. Braised Beef and my partner had the Shrimp and Grits, neither of us were left disappointed with our chooses."}
{"text":"The restaurant had only been open for two weeks so we had lowered expectations, and I am happy to say that there was no need for this. The food was, for the most part, fantastic. The warm cornbread with whipped bourbon butter is offered as the house bread, and is fantastic. Oh, and the tater tots, mmmm. Our rather large group ordered practically everything off the menu and highlights of the small bites were the chicken liver toast, two small toast halves slathered with very robust and flavorful chopped spread (must love chicken livers though); the house pickled vegetables (Very light and tangy), the goat cheese tart (so goat cheesy, flaky crust, and perfect greens on the side). The boiled peanuts with Korean spice were just OK. Gnudi small plate was quite good, with cheese stuffed Gnudi and fried artichokes on top, as were the corn dogs, made up of a trio of lobster, lamb, and duck. For the main courses, the hamburger absolutely blew the minds of everyone at the table-- it was so flavorful and juicy. Scallops were also a hit, as was the unfried chicken. For dessert, the fluffy nutter, bread slathered with peanut butter and then deep-fried and served with banana ice cream on the side, was good but not awesome, as the batter on it was a bit too thick. The Hodges ice cream, a Mitchell's made coffee ice cream with chocolate covered chex mix, was really good. The food was overall, rather salty, and I was feeling the effects of dehydration the next day, but was well worth it."}
{"text":"So i've been on a review hiatus and i'm back! 

I came here the first time for restaurant week and was pretty impressed with the Happy Hour,although the entree I ate later in the night left alot to be desired, but management was welcoming and turned a so so dinner around.

I came again for happy hour a few days ago and sure enough management recognized my guest and I and the Happy Hour food and drinks were great again.The duck confit flatbread with the jam and goat cheese is a combination I never thought I would have loved so much. The tator tots were perfectly cooked and the aoli sauce was a perfect!I also had the  wings,which had a great hot sauce taste, but would have been better if the would fry them a little crispier. It was a little too soft for my liking. I tried the macaroni as well, and I loved the figs on top which gave it a sweet salty taste, but it was very soupy,which I wish they would change, because their on to something, but macaroni should never be runny.

I'm definitely a fan of this downtown Happy Hour, I wont be dining in for an entree anytime soon,but I will be making my way back for some reasonably priced food and drinks after work!"}
{"text":"Hodges is a beautiful restaurant / bar. They definitely need a better / brighter street sign so more people know about it when walking by."}
{"text":"Found this on yelp and thought I'd give it a try. I was not disappointed! I was looking for a light lunch and this place hit the spot. The service was a bit slow in the beginning.  He eventually noticed me. A nice woodsy feel when you walk in with very low lighting. I sat by a window cause I wanted to read. 

I ordered deviled eggs as an appetizer and a salad for lunch. Everything was great! The deviled eggs were served on a wooden block. Nice size bits of hickory smoked bacon inside. A piece on top with a dash of hot sauce. Soooo delicious! I had a salad that was made of lettuce, beets, carrots, root veggies, boiled egg. Sorry forgot the name. Everything was chopped small bit size and tossed in a vingearette. I enjoyed it but thought it could've used a bit more lettuce. 

I would come back. This spot was behind a building which makes me think it's more for the office crowd."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of coworkers when we were in Cleveland. It was fairly empty on a Monday night, but our service was great and I loved the potstickers (I had that as my main meal). I would go back if I go to Ohio again. My colleague had a lot of good things to say about his burger. 

PS the exterior of Hodge's is in the Katherine Heigl movie \"Jenny's Wedding,\" which is a fun fact to me!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food and definitely the best staff in CLE.
Came in for my 19th birthday after being turned away from 2 restaurants on east 6th.
Wasn't expecting much considering how close it was to the parking but I was consistently surprised.
They were understaffed hat night but managed to keep attentiveness on our table.
The food was fantastic, the best cornbread and grits I've had north of Nashville.
Would recommend."}
{"text":"Seriously, from the first moment, this was a great dinner experience!  The Greek Salad to start was exceptional & only got me more excited about my dinner! Then our handsome server, Justin, brought out the heavenly cornbread!  It was so good we're taking what we didn't finish back to the hotel with us! The Walleye dish was really perfect too!  Glad we read all the previous reviews & chose to have dinner here. Even with high expectations, we were not disappointed!  If I lived near here, thus would be a favorite for special nights!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for what was supposed to be a leisurely lunch on a week day.  The patio was excellent, but that was probably the best part.  We had some cocktails, crab cakes, mac and cheese, and shrimp and grits.  The cocktails were good, but too expensive.  The crab cakes and grits dish were both delicious, but the mac and cheese was bland and boring.  The service was not great.  Both our appetizer and our entrees came out before our drinks, which was annoying.  Everyone else was clearly there on their lunch break from work, but we obviously were not.  Even so, our server treated us like we were in a huge rush to leave.  I wouldn't refuse to come back, but I also wouldn't feel disappointed if I never do."}
{"text":"If you're in the Cleveland area, stop into Hodge's, you won't be disappointed! My friend and I came in on a Sunday evening for dinner. We were a little thrown off upon arriving as it is located inside of what seems to be a hotel. Not that we cared, just weren't expecting it. The bar area up front was decently big along with the dining area. There are wood beams in the ceiling which gave for a nice rustic feel and every table has large red chairs..so comfy. I guess I would describe the menu as comfort food? There's a little bit of everything here. Pasta, burgers, steak, chicken, and a ton of eclectic appetizers. 

Our waitress was very friendly and brought over their famous skillet corn bread, hot out of the oven. It comes with maple butter and it is to die for. I can't believe they give it out complimentary My friend and I both ordered the burger. It came with bacon, bib lettuce, dill Havarti cheese (I thought this was an excellent choice), and bacon-onion jam all on top of a warm buttery brioche bun. The burger came with a side of tater tots and aioli for dipping, yum. Although the flavors on the burger sound weird, they all went together perfectly. It was cooked perfectly and was so juicy and flavorful. Love, love, loved all of the different flavors!

Some of the items on the menu were a bit pricey (just like any other restaurant), but our bill was cheap because of what we ordered. I would definitely stop back in here next time I'm in town, even if it's just for the cornbread :) PS. happy hour specials only apply at the bar, for food and drink."}
{"text":"I made a point of not reviewing until I came here twice. First time was for lunch last week, and the second time was last night for dinner. Both times, we had reservations, and were checked on a lot to make sure we were taken care of. 

Last night, that attention to detail was especially nice, because we had theater tickets and they were aware of the fact that we needed a slight rush on things. But I still did not feel rushed in any way by our server.

The drinks were great. I tried a seasonal margarita with cucumber and cilantro. It was waaaaay too smooth, if you know what I mean, and I found myself ordering my next drink quickly. I switched to a gin-based drink with grapefruit juice and simple syrup. I liked this one too, but not as much as the margarita.

Food was okay. The standout \"dish\" was the skillet of complimentary cornbread with maple butter. OMG. We were even offered more but we declined (I can't remember why -- we probably just didn't want to ruin our appetites).

Both times I came here, I had salads. Boring, I know. The first salad (chopped, with chicken) was excellent, while last night's (caesar, with salmon) was not the greatest. Cornbread croutons sounded like a good idea on the menu, but came off as way too sweet in this otherwise salty plate. I did try anchovies for the first time last night, and I was pleasantly surprised. I still can't look at them, but the texture was far better than I had ever imagined. The salad was kind of heavily dressed and the salmon was okay, but I've had much better versions of this dish before.

All in all, I had a very good time. I especially loved the look of the place, and the chairs are my top 5 chairs of any restaurant ever. It was just missing that extra \"oomph\" to bring it up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place for Happy Hour! I was downtown recently waiting to meet some friends for dinner and was looking for a place to grab a drink beforehand. I realized that I could not find very many happy hour places near Public Square and then Hodge's popped up on my search. 

I am so happy they have an oasis of a patio in the middle of downtown! It's chic and casual at the same time. The bartender was very nice and gave me the happy hour menu right away. This place has an amazing HH menu! They have so many drink options for $5 or less and the food is so cheap but so delicious! I ordered a Sierra Nevada for $3 and the appetizer Trio for $3 which includes a deviled egg, devil on horseback and a hank panky. I was so excited about the hanky panky and rightfully so when I tasted it- it has some sort of jam on it that makes it stellar. You can also get 4 potstickers for $2! What?!!! That's insane right? But those are so good too!

I find it refreshing to be able to get an affordable HH in the middle of downtown!"}
{"text":"Just a quick lunch at the bar. Bartender was very personable and got everything out on time. Had the salmon which was cooked perfectly and I enjoyed everything that came on the dish. Also had the lobster flatbread which was great. Priced very reasonably for the portion sizes. Would like to return for dinner"}
{"text":"Service needs improvement. It could be so much better. Food is hit or miss probably depending on cooks. Waist of a good location if you ask me. Management needs to tighten up."}
{"text":"Great find for lunch! Pumpkin bisque was sweet & savory DELISH! 
Have to ask for free cornbread at lunch, worth having it as dessert...sweet maple butter.
The lunch plate is a good deal, cup of soup, 1/2 sandwich, and small salad, loved getting taste all the items."}
{"text":"Started with deviled eggs and pot stickers which were great (5/5). Then complimentary corn bread was delivered which was also excellent (5/5). I had a tasty burger (4/5) and my wife had the braised beef which was very good (5/5). The burger was heavy on the marinade and toppings which made it a little messier and more complex than it needed to be since the beef patty was so good. Solid beer and wine selection with wide ranging choices from different regions."}
{"text":"Had a really nice Happy Hour meal here before a recent event at The Q.  We sat at the bar and took advantage of both drink and food specials.

Drinks were well crafted and tasty (I had the Moscow Mule).  We shared a number of appetizer selections including wings (a bit sweet and sticky), deviled eggs, hanky-panky and a bacon-wrapped date.  Their tots with garlic aioli dipping sauce were fantastic.  We finished the meal each ordering our own dish...my friend ordered a wedge salad and i had a bowl of Beer Cheese soup.  The soup was on the thin side for this kind of recipe, but the flavor was spot-on.  Great for a cold night!

Will return, when I have the chance."}
{"text":"I ate here on a business trip.  the food was excellent - I had a steak which was great, and my guests also greatly enjoyed the food.  Good service as well.  An excellent spot for taking business clients, a touch noisy but the place has a sense of upscale casual local flair."}
{"text":"Great place with an awesome patio.  Friendly staff and excellent food.  If you think the food is overpriced, Applebees and TGI Fridays might be better choices for you.  You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Hodge ' s came well recommended. Ordered scallops and risotto.  Scallops were slightly rubbery. Risotto was not true risotto. It tasted more like rice with a sauce stirred in. I frankly can make better at home cThere are so many good alternatives in the neighborhood, I probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome complimentary cornbread, tasty Hanky Pankies, Devils on Horseback and Goat Cheese Tart appetizers. Very good Bay of Fundy Salmon and Cheeseburger. Very good service. Good experience all around!"}
{"text":"Food is always good here.  Blue crab hushpuppies are killer good.  And their burger is easily in top 3 in Cleveland.  Service was attentive on a Friday night.  Valet your car out front for $8.  Just know that the valet leaves at 11pm so tell them to drive your car out of the garage and leave it out front so it doesn't get locked in the garage."}
{"text":"This place is just a great place let me tell you. I thoroughly enjoy my visits here. It is in the Residences at 668 Buildings, not my first place to live but to be close to Hodge's may make it worth it let me tell you. I have not eaten an entree here as of yet, however I come for EtOH and bread pudding. I have gotten the break pudding twice and it is a stellar break pudding. The first time I felt it was plain bread pudding and I had to get without nuts and they did not ignore my plea and it was nut free but still really good. That night I tried their barrel Manhattan which was very nice. I also had a long island which was good in terms of a long island iced tea. Then I got a older bourbon to try it with a big ole' piece of ice. It was not bad at all, I like the ice since it watered it down a bit and it was like two different drinks. Usually I chug my drinks down but luckily I was talking up something vast. So a week later we visited again and I got the bread pudding again but this time it was blueberry and just as good. no nuts! I wanted to try a scotch this time so I got the cheapest one they offered which was 12 years old. Considering that I am 23, let me tell you, that is something to drink something that has been becoming prime as I have. Something wicked I tell you. I also got a amaretto sour which was very good. 

It is not the cheapest place by god, but it is good and that is sometimes worth it in itself. The bartenders are really good and if you choose to park your mode of transport; the garage is very tall."}
{"text":"So, disclosure first. I was lucky enough to get invited to a preview dinner for this place last night. Which, ya know, means I got fed for free. And the service was impeccable, because frankly if your service can't be impeccable during a small closed service when you're trying to impress people, then you should fire them all and start from scratch, right? Keeping this in mind, I'm going to offer you no insight as to what the crowds might be like, or the service on a busy night. I liked all the staff I talked to, but that's hardly objective. 

Hodges is in the old Zinc spot on Euclid, and I'm a bit sad to see Zinc go, because they had that one cherry drink that took like ten minutes to make and then they set it on fire, and there's pretty much no better patio downtown to sit on a warm night and drink something that was very recently on fire. Recommendation to Hodges: make some sort of flaming drink please. Regardless, it's the same patio, and I love that patio. It's back from the street, it's surrounded by towering buildings, and it was smart of Hodges to take that space because when summer comes, you are all going to want to hang out there. Fire pit! Inside the restaurant is very cozy and non-threatening, which is always a consideration for me when going downtown. While I'm sure it will be full of young professionals after work, it's got the same chill casual vibe as Noodlecat going, where if I show up all punked out for a show or grungy from a day at the library, I'd feel just as comfortable hanging out in the bar as going there fancied up for a date. 

While we were waiting to be seated, I got a Buckeye Cleveland IPA from the bar, and the bartender was nice enough to keep the huge bottle behind the bar for me, so I didn't have to walk around two fisting my glass and the bottle. I'm not a regular beer drinker, but they had a pretty decent selection, and more importantly, enough different things that I was curious to try. It was a nice medium sized list. The cocktails list seemed very creative, I appreciate complicated combinations. The few that my friends ordered were a little sweeter than I prefer, but they were all girly girls :) And they like them just fine.. I know mason jars are trendy now, but as someone who has been known to topple a martini glass or two with her clumsiness, I have no complaints. We did get to sample two cocktails, and I wish I could remember what they were, cause the drink menu isn't on the website. One I know was a manhattan with peppercorns in it, and that was fantastic. When I go back after opening, that's probably what I would order again. Point is, the bar had it's shit together, and someone gave a lot of thought into their creations, there was a lot of originality. 

We were started off with bacon sprinkled tater tots, served with a sour cream sauce. Happy Dog has gotten me a little bored with tater tots, but they were good. The sauce was really the star. Next came cornbread with maple butter, and frankly when does anyone ever go wrong with cornbread? If there's anything I'm happy about with this whole trend towards upscale comfort food, it's the reemergence of cornbread. Cornbread forever. 

There were two memorable spots on the tasting menu for me: the pine nut \"baked beans\" and the potato shards and beans that came with the hangar steak. The pine nuts were amazing. Apparently they are only on the starters menu, but I wish they were the star of a whole entree. I am immediately going to start trying to braise pine nuts on my own, and that's the kind of inspiration I really want to walk away with from a restaurant. The second dish, (potato shards, beans and hangar steak) really hit it out of the park with the beans and potatoes. The heirloom beans were coated in this creamy almost mustardy sauce I loved. The potato shards were like hash browns, only lighter and fluffier, and if I could get all my hash browns cooked that way, I might finally understand their dominance on breakfast menus everywhere. The steak itself was very well cooked, but it's just very hard to impress me with meat anymore. When you do cool things to vegetables, I'm far more excited. 

One thing that being included at preview tastings has taught me is how to eat fish without complaining, because I don't normally eat fish or seafood, but you can't really be that awful person who refuses to try it. The tuna poppers we had were okay, but raw tuna is absolutely not my thing. The scallop dish though was very pretty, graceful even, and the scallop's sweetness went perfectly with the grapefruit segment. No seafood girl ate the whole thing. 

Dessert  was a miniature fried apple pie, which was cute, but not exactly impressive. The sauce that came with it was fantastic. Seriously, that kitchen is great at sauces.

In conclusion, I would definitely come back here and pay for a meal. I'm not the kind of girl who goes out downtown very often, so coming from me, that's saying something."}
{"text":"In town for a show at the Palace and wandered in.  Glad we did.  

The chef is creative with things everyone has had in the past.  Noir comfort food.  Anthony Bourdain would be at home here.  The servers are knowledgeable and know when to stay away.  Good beer selections.  Great deserts.  We came.  We ate.  We conquered.  We left; for  our 7:00 show.  

We'll be back when we come in for a game."}
{"text":"Had dinner there this evening. Ordered crab hush puppies & shrimp and grits. Let me tell you about these hush puppies...crunchy on the outside and soft, full of sweet crab on the inside. Highly recommend them and I may go back for some tomorrow...the shrimp and grits were not to my liking(notw a fan of the beer cheese blanc I think it was) but my sweet server immediately took them back and replaced them with a scallops and risotto dish. Scallops were perfection.  Service was impeccable."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously over-priced!  Had lunch there with 3 other friends from the office.  Two ordered an item that would have benefited to have a piece of bread with it (full salad for one and crab cake entree for the other).  They would not give them a piece of bread!!!  Said they'd have to charge $2.50 for focaccia bread and $2.00 for an order of corn bread.  This, after spending $13 for the crab cake and $10 for the salad.  Two of us had chicken salad sandwiches, which were good, but certainly not worth $12.  Seriously??  $12 for a chicken salad sandwich?  It came with tater tots but let's face the fact that this is not the best economy right now.  May be why the place was not packed at 12:00 on a Friday afternoon!!  Will not go back."}
{"text":"7 tables open and turning people away because they had a party coming in at 7:00. 4 hours could have generated a nice amount of revenue. Turning away people visiting the city for Nationals was not a good idea. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here a while ago after a Monsters game, which just happened to be a night when a big Indians game was just getting out as well. I had called ahead about 2 hours in advance to make a reservation, and luckily was able to get in. We arrived and were seated within a few minutes. Our server was prompt and service overall was very fast. Given that it was unusually hectic (considering all the traffic from people eating following both games) I was surprised they seemed to continue running smoothly. We received an appetizer (the cornbread is to die for!) along with an apology from both the waitstaff in management for the delay. 

I was blown away, because service certainly seemed speedy to me! As we ate someone - whether the hostess, server, or managers - checked on us periodically. We never had to flag anyone down for anything and I loved seeing the teamwork between servers and managers helping each other out! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better restaurants in Cleveland.  The location is downtown but slightly off the beaten path and the decor is unique but nice, kind of retro, and comfortable.  The food is excellent but not generally cutting edge, think locally sourced upscale comfort food executed extremely well.  Complimentary corn bread and tater tots seem to be served to every table - the corn bread is fine but nothing to write home about and the tater tots were very crispy and tasted good especially served with a nice slightly spicy mayo-based sauce.  Other than that the Swedish meatball starter and mac & cheese side dish are very good, and a dish called \"pish sticks\" are somehow very good - they're house made pulled pork formed into long \"fish stick\" shapes and coated with a really crisp mixture on the outside.  The burger is also really good (again served with tater tots) and everything on the menu is good for what it is and executed perfectly every night.

In addition to good food and service, the beverage options are outstanding and Hodge's has one of the best cocktail programs I've seen (including living in New Orleans, Portland, and Chicago and working in places like San Francisco and New York).  Excellent cocktails, and a nicely chosen if slightly small wine list.  If you're downtown in Cleveland, it's hard to go wrong with Hodge's - unless you're on a diet of course...   :)"}
{"text":"I scoped out Hodges weeks before our trip to Cleveland. I was dead set on getting the scallops, but when we got there we decided to get take out. No way was I getting scallops for take out, so I will have to wait until we visit again (which we totally will). 

Instead we got a couple of apps and the CAB burger. The CAB burger was cooked to perfection. The havarti dill is an awesome element to the burger. 

We settled in the mushroom gnocchi and blue crab hush puppies for apps. The gnocchi was really good. I liked the sauce and the mushrooms. The actually gnocchi could have been a little more seasoned, but it was cooked perfectly. Not mushy at all. The hush puppies were good. Especially with the old bay'onaise and cucumber accompaniments. 

And the cornbread...ahhhhhh, the cornbread. Amazing. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! The menu is limited but that is because it is seasonal, fresh, and local ingredients. Reasonable price for excellent presentation and gourmet food. Drinks are nice and stiff.

Met the owner and will definitely check out his other establishments."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we will definitely be back!!!  The food and service were amazing.  We had the tater tots for an appetizer, which were a great combination of cheesy and crunchy.  I had the Ohio chicken with cheesy potatoes and beans.  The combination was amazing and delicious.  Oh, and I can't forget to mention the incredible cornbread.  It melts in your mouth and was as good as dessert!!! We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Alright.

Weirdly empty on a Thursday night, but the atmosphere was nice. The service was ok - but they were out of about half the drinks I ordered!

Food was ok, but the shrimp and grits were too rich. The burger was super!

Would loved to have seen charles ramsey."}
{"text":"I went here for a nice dinner with my boyfriend. Our waiter, Steve, was phenomenal. He was attentive, offered many sincere suggestions, and made our dining experience one of the best I've had in a long time. The food was delicious, priced well for the portion size, and came out pretty quickly! I love that you can make reservations online here as well."}
{"text":"Hodges did it.
See I love the concept, and the two trucks are good.  In fact, they served food at my sisters wedding, which was cool.

The place is hipster swanky.  Waiters walk around in 'spendies and bright red chucks.  Old souly barmy mix type feel, loungey.  For some reason the place reminds me a lot of Stueben's in Denver, which also sprang from a food truck, serves soul food, has a dark loungy type feel, and a cult following.  But in a younger city.  I won't compare the two beyond that.

I ate there last night, super pleasant."}
{"text":"Hodge's is one of my favorites in Cleveland. Conveniently located in Downtown on Euclid. It's a small space, but they have a dope bar area which all of the restaurant surrounds. And I really love the space above the kitchen.

It's the little details like how the wait staff wears red chucks or getting your bill in an envelope that says \"damage\". Every time I been to Hodge's, the service has been exceptional, whether I'm sitting at the bar watching the game or trying to grab a seat on a busy night. It's always a personable experience.

There isn't a lot on the menu I haven't tried. The entrées alone, you can't really go wrong with any of the dinner items. I personally like the pork, short ribs, and walleye. Every meal comes with complementary corn bread on the house. CORN BREAD !! And a side of sweet potato tots. Who does that ?!"}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland in Feb. We went on a Saturday night:

The Good:
Hangar steak was really good and I don't even like steak. I saw some other reviews for it and decided to give it a whirl - sauce was really good.

Bacon wrapped dates were excellent too. They were stuffed with chorizo which wasn't bad but I prefer to have them stuffed with bleu cheese.

Cocktails were excellent. We had some ginger beer concoction and the other was a fizz something or other. 

Service was EXCELLENT. attentive w/o being in your face.

Atmosphere was quiet and the seating didn't feel like you were dining with the couple next to you

Location convenient to Tower City/Gateway/Playhouse

The Bad:
N/A

Somewhere in Between:

{"text":"Excellent food!! The BLTsalad was so yummy and the truffle ravioli was exploding with flavor. Super friendly staff and great atmosphere; love the outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a Friday conference and extended my stay so my boyfriend could fly in and we could check out the city over the weekend. Unfortunately, the bf didn't make it onto his standby flight, so I was stuck getting dinner on my own. I was staying at a hotel downtown, so walked the short distance to Hodge's, which seemed like a solid choice based on previous Yelp reviews. It was around 8:30 on Friday and the place was pretty dead. I sat at the bar and was the only new customer. The other parties had already paid their tabs and left shortly after I sat down, so I found myself alone despite there being two bartenders on duty. I had to wait to be acknowledged and receive menus. I had to wait longer to order drinks. I then had to wait even longer to order my food, and had to stop the bartender from leaving the bar when he popped in by asking him if I could order, as if I was bothering him. Why was service so inattentive and essentially nonexistent? I was literally the only person sitting at the bar. Was it because I was alone? Was it because I am a female? Did the two bartenders have too much sidework to catch up on during their shift? Maybe I should have just sat at a table instead of the bar? Yes, the free cornbread and the burger that the food runner dropped were good, but there was no bartender in sight until I was halfway done with my food. The cocktail I ordered was also a glorified mixed drink that was off balance and overpriced. In sum, I wouldn't come back here even if did live in Cleveland. I'd give two stars for a \"meh\" rating, but the food bumps up Hodges to \"ok.\""}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, and nice outdoor location. We loved the Monday night trivia game. Food was mediocre: lots of vegetarian options on the online menu, but very little when we were there. Food was heavy, heavily fried, overdressed."}
{"text":"I just got home from a great Guy's Weekend in Cleveland which included two visits to Hodge's! We found Hodge's through Yelp as a great place for a group and then after dinner on Friday with a need for a private room on Saturday they accommodated us last minute. Great beer selection and great food. Two meals gave us a chance to try quite a bit. I highly recommend the hanky panky, scallops, chicken tortilla soup, loaded tots and the burger. Thanks to Jenny and her staff for a tremendous experience."}
{"text":"I went on Monday night for half off on burgers and free corn bread.  The Burger was very good specially considering i paid half. Unfortunately,  they have no option chicken options on their menu"}
{"text":"Unique, creative hearty food with huge portions. Started with complimentary freshly made cornbread with maple bourbon butter. Duck wings were crispy and had a spicy, tangy sauce. Braised beef flatbread was fantastic and was dripping with garlicky flavor. Shrimp poboy and tater tots were excellent. Fried pork cutlet was huge and came with large portion of papardelle alfredo with big chunks of pancetta bacon.

Very friendly waiters. They gave us an extra cornbread for free as we left."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this is not a bad restaurant it was just was not so great when we were there.  The staff was really friendly and attentive and the restaurant looks great. Now the not so great things. There were about 20 nats buzzing the side lights at our table that attacked us when we started to eat, our really nice waitress forgot I asked for an appetizer (not a big issue, it happens), my hanger steak was burnt  (I asked for just before well done) med-well. My wife who is really picky didn't enjoy her meal of Ohio Chicken but she doesn't like anything so let's just say the food looked great to me. I'm not a really picky person so I ate my burnt steak with the really great tasting mashed potatoes and asparagus. Can't say I'll be back but I am pretty sure that I caught the restaurant at a bad time."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my FAVORITE places to eat in downtown Cleveland.  Whenever I come back into town, I always try to make time to eat here.  The tots are to die for; the lunchbox offerings are always amazing.  The indoor decor is wonderful; I have dined on the patio and loved it, too.  The only complaint is that the service is not consistent; they often seem understaffed or the staff don't seem to care very much the customers even when you tell them you've flown 700 miles to eat there.  I personally love this place much more than the Greenhouse Tavern over on East 4th Street."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Hodge's with another couple for restaurant week.  We didn't end up dining off the restaurant week menu because of their special menu for Tuesday where you get 1 appetizer, 2 entrees plus a bottle of wine for only $40...WHAT?!?  It was a better deal than restaurant week and the appetizer was certainly large enough to share.  You could choose from six appetizers and nine entrees.  We got the goat cheese tart to start and it was delicious and I wish I had it all for myself.  Yum!  My husband had the hangar steak and enjoyed it and I ordered the mac & cheese.  Overall I thought it lacked flavor if you didn't have a bite with a date in it.  We certainly plan on returning...on a Tuesday!  Service was great and instead of pointing out that meals were coming out slowly he brought us some cornbread which was much appreciated.  I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"I've been to Hodges a handful of times for both lunch, dinner and take-out now, and I echo what most reviewers have noted, that I find it can be somewhat hit-or-miss on food.  Service has been consistently good, but never outstanding.  I've seen the patio packed on several occasions, but I've yet to see a large wait typical of some of the better known establishments in the area.    

Several of their offerings have been great. The trout soup and pan seared salmon are definite standouts.  On the other side of the spectrum, the salads are overly dressed and the portion feels light and ratios of ingredients off. The spicy fried chicken sandwich falls squarely in the middle, not spicy enough for my taste but it did have good texture and was cooked well.

I would rate the restaurant 3 stars, but I really like that the food is somewhat different, and the unique, experimental-feeling spin convinced me to take my rating up to 4 stars.  Hopefully they continue to experiment with the menu and retain the standouts, while dropping or modifying the less spectacular fare."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for years and finally got the chance.  Unfortunately, we came before the Indians home opener so it was packed and we had to sit in the atrium.  My dad didn't mind, but I did miss not being in the ambiance of the main dining area.  I had a chicken sandwich and it was amazing.  Beer list was solid too.  Our server was very nice.  I would def want to go back for the full menu/full dining area experience."}
{"text":"I will not come back here....very disappointing to read all the great reviews. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the patio atmosphere was lovely and the deviled egged and cornbread were very good. The service was poor....it took almost an hour for our food and the scallops were over cooked (very chewy) and for the price, they could have given me at least 4 scallops. It was 3 plus a spoon full of risotto that was not done.  Very mediocre food for the money spent."}
{"text":"I dined there for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the meatballs for lunch which were delicious. They were the perfect density, size, and were cooked just right. They came in a Au poive -sp sauce with wild mushrooms, I would definitely order again. I got a Caesar salad, but didn't realize it had bacon it it. It was very very salty to the point where my lips were starting to get raw. It cam with huge croutons, and the dressing was very very good and tasted homemade. My boyfriend got a turkey sandwich that was delightful. Brioche bread, thinly sliced turkey and thick bacon. It was served with tater tots which were just OK. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First time I went here this place packed, hence I think it was still within the first two weeks of its grand opening. Food was amazing, fun environment, decent wine menu and beer selection and lots of free apps courtesy of the chef. So, just last night I ventured back there again. Pretty empty for a Friday night. Maybe it was the inconsistent weather?!? Minus my glass of water never being re-filled until I payed my bill, the appetizer...pish something was \"eh\" and my salmon was waaaay over cooked. Such a bummer. And the free snacks from the check were okay at best. The cornbread was dry and burnt. $100 something dollars later, I wish the food was consistent from my first visit and worth the cost. Tentative if I'll return again."}
{"text":"I really like this place. We had an appetizer called \"the Hanky Panky\" an awesome spin on a classic appetizer! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Hodge's is a fantastic addition to the Gateway area, and especially to the 668 building where Zinc was simply an embarrassment.  The way the space has been redone, with the addition of TVs and excellent music makes it much more casual, upbeat, and bar-friendly.  A far, far cry from the dark, dreary decor and terrible service at Zinc!  I must admit that I liked it so much that I have been twice in the past week - and it only opened last Thursday!  

The happy hour drinks in the bar area are available until 8pm, and the food is excellent.  Although one reviewer complained that the food is not inventive, I would a) disagree, and b) assert that the flavors are wonderfully inspired.  So far, I have tried the mussels (which cooked to perfection and served in a delicious, curry-like sauce with toasted baguette); hodges honey ribs (falling off the bone and slathered in a light honey mustard); the big dipper (a must if you like corndogs - lobster? lamb? duck? delicious!); and the french onion ravioli (a really unique take on french onion soup!).  In addition, we received 2 free amuse bouche tasters - the tater tots and cornbread.  I also had several of their cocktails, which were delicious, strong and fun - one came in a mason jar and was shaken and served table-side.

The service was excellent, prompt and friendly. I fully intend to take advantage of the extended happy hour hours when the weather gets warmer and they open up the patio.  It's already on its way to becoming a downtown staple in my mind."}
{"text":"2 for $40 on Wednesday nights! 1 bottle of wine, 1 app and 2 entrees for $40. Are you flipping serious? I feel like most nice places that advertise a great deal like this might only offer you skimped out versions of their dishes - this is totally not the case at Hodge's. Everything was great."}
{"text":"We had tickets Saturday night to the Last Call Cleveland show  at Playhouse Square but no dinner reservations. And when we are in that situation anywhere around E. 6th St., then our go-to place is Hodge's.
Of the mid-level restaurants along Euclid Ave./E. 4th St., I would say it has arguably the best food plus there's the added benefit of having a large bar area so you can almost always get a seat (even easier in the summer when their humongous patio is open).
On this night our drinks were the Old O' Old-Fashioned (I just love the single giant ice cube -- cools the drink without quickly watering it down) while Jeannene went with the gin-based Beehive.
Our appetizer is usually the blue crab hushpuppies ($12.50) with a sumptious \"old bay'onaise\" but this time we went with a lighter choice -- Peaches + Ginger Toast. The five two-bite toasts had a soft peach that sat on a small mound of goat cheese with balsamic vinegar drizzled over them. It was not too peachy and the goat cheese was whipped giving at an lighter texture (this is the 2nd Cleveland restaurant that I've seen this technique at so hopefully it is becoming a trend). Overall, a perfect light appetizer, especially considering they serve you get hot, sweet cornbread with every meal. 
For main course, I went the opposite of light -- crispy pork cutlet and fettuccine ($18.50). It seems at Hodge's that at least one thing we order has a unique spin to it (perhap's Chris Hodge's food truck influence?) and in this case it was the pork. Normally this would be breaded but this version had a very light batter which seemed to have been flash-fried, hence the \"crispy.\" The dish came with tomato jam which the server warned had a kick to it, but that's what was needed when dealing with a hunk of pork and luscious fettucine alfredo.
Jeannene had the Bay of Fundy Salmon ($25) which came on a bed of fried rice and topped with a pineapple-habanero salso. Again, the touch of uniqueness -- you can find a salmon dish that includes rice, but fried rice? Needless to say, both dishes worked.
One thing about the atmosphere -- the large space coupled with the \"Hodge's\" sign above the bar spelled out in light bulbs reminds me of an old-time saloon and it is as loud as one (or so I've seen in Hollywood movies). But I think that just adds to the playfulness of the menu,"}
{"text":"It was good! The tater tots with toppings and egg was the standout, but how could that possibly be bad? I had a ceasar salad, which was pretty run of the mill and some wings that had a very interesting rub on them. Not my favorite, but that's what makes a horse race. I was satisfied, but when in town again I would not return. The staff were great."}
{"text":"This is a Happy Hour worth visiting.  I sat at the outside bar area which is a nice hidden away area.  The beer deals range $2-$4  and wine or cocktails for $5.  I got a whole plate of delicious pot stickers for $2!  Inexpensive and tasty is my kind of happy hour."}
{"text":"What a great place. This was my first time, but it won't be my last. I met some people for lunch and we all had the lunchbox. There is a choice between 2 soups, plus a choice between two salads, plus a choice between 3 sandwich halves. I went with the root vegetable salad, tomato bisque, and grilled cheese. Perfect portion for a great lunch. Very complimentary elements and beautifully presented. The service is excellent and I loved the round red chairs for seating. Very fun and funky. Plus, what great glasses for the water and soft drinks. I know that seems like a simple thing, but it is a nice touch. There were many holiday celebrations going on all around us so it's definitely good for gatherings as well. 
I look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Had this place recommended to us by a few locals. It was awful. This is a small restaurant that 4 servers should have been able to cover. No one greeted us at the door. Had to flag someone down to be seated. At a dirty table. 

We were there 45 mins before getting waters. Got a few small plates delivered to the table. An hour after arriving we still didn't have the rest of our food. No one asked if we wanted a second cocktail. They just gave excuses as to why the service was so bad. 

Horrible. Will not come back. If you are visiting Cleveland, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We always enjoy going to Hodge's, and the new fall menu did not disappoint. The steak tartare appetizer was excellent -- one of the best I've ever had. Nice salty sesame crisps to go with the steak, which had sour pickles incorporated throughout. My husband had the mussels, as he always does at Hodge's -- the latest version includes korean sausage, which was delicious. Trout was great, creamy polenta was perfect, and the apple hand pie with Mitchell's salted caramel ice cream was excellent! Not to mention the cornbread with maple bourbon butter and the tater tot amuse. Sigh. I always eat too much when I go to Hodge's, but I can't help it! Also have to give a shout out to our server, Patrick. We bonded over our love of steak tartare. : )"}
{"text":"Meh, that about sums it up! Service was super friendly and quick but I can't say I expect any less because there was literally one other table in the whole place during our dining. The food just didn't wow me on any level, and trust me, I am the comfort food queen. Mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, cornbread are all great friends of mine and I finished the meal with a \"humph\". I do plan on relaxing on their patio this summer with a refreshing drink to soak up the short Cleveland summer and maybe I'll order something to nosh on then. If so, I'll report back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is always well prepared, and the staff is really friendly.  The patio is a fantastic place to relax after a long day at the office, or before heading out to a nearby event.

Great lunch option for those who work downtown!"}
{"text":"Had a tasting here for Driftwood Catering, which will be catering a really important personal event coming up. It was...delicious. 5 star all the way.

Here's what we tried:

Baby kale and smoked mozzarella: 5
My favorite salad ever! Loved the crispy shallots and roasted apples. It had a really nice sweet, smoky flavor. 

Mackenzie Salad: 4
Goat cheese and salad - huge chunks of fresh local goat cheese and good greens. I enjoyed this one, especially because I like goat cheese, but I think the flavor was a little strong. I enjoyed the baby kale one more.

Chris Hodgson's gnocchi: 5
It was yum. Just yum. Not too dense, perfect consistency, and good flavor. 

Shrimp and grits: 5
This is my favorite shrimp and grits ever! The beer blanc just makes it interesting. The grits are creamy and the cheese isn't overpowering. The shrimp is huge and very fresh + flavorful.

Not on menu: oxtail ragu and pierogies: 5
So yummy. The oxtail ragu is superb. Get anything with oxtail in it!

6 veg: 3.5
Our vegetarian option. The veggies they picked were fresh and amazing, but the combination kept me wanting. I think it's because they're separate veggies on a plate - wish there was more sauce or something to make it feel less like a side.

Pan-seared scallops over risotto: 4
Really delicious! Great scallops, and the risotto is addictive. I would keep eating it all day if possible.

Short ribs: 4.5
I didn't try this one, but my beau loved them! Definitely try this dish.

There you have it. Yum."}
{"text":"First let me say that the ambiance of this place is cool and easy going. Not pretentious. It has an amazing outdoor eating area and bar that are worth a visit.

The beer list is limited but fantastic.

Unfortunate, the food leaves a lot to be desired. I had the wings which were breaded (why!!!) and weirdly sweet. I will never understand why bread something that fries so perfectly!?

The chopped salad was unimpressive.

The appetizer trio was blah.

So, come here to drink and find gastropu fare elsewhere."}
{"text":"The pros?  The food. A good number of vegetarian/vegan options that are quite tasty.  The must haves are the mushroom gnocchi, the (complementary) tater tots, the amazing potato stack, the cornbread and the brownie sundae.  The baby kale/smoked mozzarella salad was mushy by the time I mixed in the dressing and apple, and the mozzarella was dry and flavorless.

The cons?  The service was ridiculous.  Our waitress smiled maybe once.  I had to ask her several times what she was putting down before she walked away (what kind of butter is it? what kind of dipping sauce is it? what kind of ice cream comes with the brownie?) Also, the kitchen refused to do a vegetarian version of the Sunday dinner chef's whim, even though the menu is very vegetarian friendly and the place was maybe 1/3 full.  That's lazy. 

Finally, the parking situation is confusing.  If you self park the cost is $30, but valet is $7.  Be sure to let the valet know you parked self parked there before you leave, otherwise you'll be stuck paying $30. When I asked the hostess about this she said it's been a problem for a long time.  A solution isn't that difficult. One sign, or a helpful hostess, will do."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great appetizer menu. Regular menu was somewhat limited.
Recommended for sure!"}
{"text":"Pros: nice looking place, they accommodated our larger group in a private room. Staff very courteous. Good drinks list.

Cons: while I understand that it is harder to serve a party of ten than a party of two, we ordered dinner at approximately 8:30 and it arrived at approximately 9:40. No bread was served in the interim, so it was puzzling that they brought several pans of cornbread simultaneously with the meal (which, incidentally, is above average for restaurant bread, though nowhere near as good as the free cornbread at Cleveland Chop, or the a la carte cornbread at House of Blues).  The only people at the table who were particularly happy with their meals were those who ordered the burgers.

Scallops were cooked very nicely, though risotto was average at best and portion size (even for a scallop dish) was quite small for the price. Ordered a side of asparagus, about 2/3 of which was so thoroughly blackened that I left it untouched (the waitress nicely offered to bring a new order or to take it off the bill.)

Overall, a disappointing experience. Really wanted to like it, expected more based upon chef/owner's recent accolades, but with the drastically superior alternatives available in what has become a top-notch restaurant city, will not be back."}
{"text":"Very nice inside, service was good, and we ordered the burgers (half-off) which came with tater tots and dipping sauce.  We were all surprised at the flavorfulness of the burger (I mean come on its a burger right?) and tater tots and especially the dipping sauce which I and most of my party could not get enough of...Only problem is place is overall very expensive and at least for my party and I would not be affordable if not for the sales they had that night..."}
{"text":"GO NOW! try their brown butter fettuccine this is an order! but okay seriously this is a great lunch spot if you're in town. their menu seems to have a southern feed, shrimp and grits, mac and cheese, duck tacos. Its unique for sure.

The inside is nicely decorated, leads to a nice dining experience. The tomato bisque is some of the best ever, the animal tots melt in your mouth. You get a great portion of food for your money, and will definitely leave satisfied.

My only gripe is the service, it was on the slower side, granted it was the lunch rush, or maybe perhaps our waitress was having an off day as she needed to keep being reminded of our order and drinks. 

Its definitely not kid friendly, the menu was not desirable at all for a child, so keep the kids home and have a date night !"}
{"text":"The environment is really cool and the food is pretty delicious. That being said, I haven't had service this bad in a long time. Showed up at 8:15 for our 8:15 reservation, but weren't seated until 8:30 (not a problem). We had drinks from the bar, so we just ordered water. Eventually, she came back to take our food order. The food took forever and as we were waiting, we still didn't have our water and our drinks were empty. We ordered a second drink, our food came, and still no drink. They comp'd the drinks but then ended up overcharging us on our salads. We were there for over 2 hours and only ordered 2 salads and an app."}
{"text":"My Wife and I were in Cleveland on a Tuesday and chose Hodge's for dinner because it was within walking distance of our hotel and I saw the good reviews here on yelp.  We chose to sit outside in the courtyard and my Wife noticed the two for $40 Tuesday deal which includes a bottle of house wine (the white is pinot grigio which is what my Wife enjoys) a choice of one of six appetizers and two choices of seven entrees.  We chose the blue crab hushpuppies for our app, my Wife chose the crispy pork cutlet and I chose the braised beef.  The hushpuppies were very good.  Our waitress who I deeply regret not remembering her name was beyond excellent.  When she brought out our entrees I noticed the pork cutlet looked a little dark as opposed to golden brown.  I asked if it always came out that dark and the waitress apologized for even bringing it out because in the light of outside (as opposed to the much darker light of inside the restaurant) she said that it was darker than normal and would replace it immediately.  Five minutes later it was replaced with a golden brown cutlet.  My braised beef was very good and my Wife enjoyed the cutlet.  We were not the least bit upset especially due to the amazing two for $40 deal but the waitress insisted on buying my Wife a dessert.  She chose the caramel apple crisp which was also very good.  I don't think I have ever had a better value at a restaurant.  When you add the top notch service of our waitress, the overall experience was amazing and I have told anyone I know who is going to Cleveland about our experience."}
{"text":"We got here on a Saturday and would have been seated right away except we insisted on sitting outside. So while we waited we sat at the bar outside which was very nice, good drinks and some tvs. Then we were seated and had the complementary cornbread which is so good and the tater tots. Then we ordered the french onion ravioli and the lamb loin. Neither one of these dishes would we get again. They were good but not as good as we were hoping. But the atmosphere and location is so great and the menu looks so promising I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! My parents and went here tonight to celebrate my birthday, and I couldn't have picked a better restaurant.  Walking in, I knew it was going to be good... The red chairs and lights gave it a cool vibe.  Our waiter, Lance, was super friendly and made us feel very welcome.  We started out with the animal style tater tots-absolutely amazing! The tots were crunchy on the outside and had a nice salty flavor. They were covered with pulled pork, bacon, cheese, and a big fried egg. Every single bite was melt in your mouth delicious. I would go again just for that appetizer (although the hostess told us that they're reinventing the dish in a poutine style with gravy and cheese curds in the near future which also sounds delicious).  I had a prosecco spritz and liked it so much that I ordered another (my mom did the same). It was light and bubbly with a hint of sweet and muddled fruit, yum! For my entree I had the burger which was cooked to perfection. It was juicy and the thousand island dressing on it added the perfect flavor. It was served with (more) tater tots that came with a seracha dipping sauce that I could have eaten with a spoon. What a yummy meal!  My dad got the steak with polenta which he thought was perfectly cooked and delicious.  Then, since it was my birthday, they surprised me with an orange creme brûlée... I really liked the added orange flavor and my dad practically licked the plate clean.  I am already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"You HAVE to stop here if you're in Cleveland. Atmosphere is really cool. Casual, with music and a few tvs. Staff is friendly. You get corn bread while you wait that is really good. The chicken sandwich was awesome and they give you a ton of tater tots. Definitely going back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Hodge's is now one of my new favorite restaurants. 

I feel like I need to comment on the staff first because they provided the first impression and what a first impression that was! They were wonderful! Everyone was so pleasant, informative, and accommodating. They didn't even care when Fake Boyfriend asked to switch tables -- because he can't EVER just sit where we are originally seated. It's like a nervous tick or something. MUST.ASK.TO.CHANGE.SEATS.OR.WILL.SELF.DESTRUCT. Our server, Amanda, laughed it off and just put us in a new spot like it was no big deal at all. 

We immediately ordered drinks. An IPA for FB and a Beehive for me. I loved that cocktail so hard. And they had plenty of interesting cocktails on the menu. 

Soon after, we were served an amuse bouche (sorry, I know that sounds pretentious) of tater tots with a really good southwest-ish dipping sauce. Then skillet cornbread with maple bourbon butter. All complimentary. OMG .... that cornbread and butter were totally bomba$$. I actually ate some of that butter with a spoon. 

Appetizer: We ordered the ribs. Easily some of the best ribs ever. House-smoked. Very flavorful.

Dinner: I ordered the scallops. EXCELLENT. Perfectly cooked with a sweet corn risotto. I ate every last bite.
FB ordered the burger. It was easily one of the best burgers in CLE. 

Another thing that I want to mention, and most people won't really care about this at all.... but I LOVE how all of the staff is allowed to be themselves at this restaurant. Bright orange hair, visible tattoos, whatever. You can tell that they all love their jobs and maybe one of the reasons for that is because they are allowed to express themselves. Sure, they were all wearing basically the same uniform, including red chucks (which I thought were adorable). And obviously, Hodge's is not the first/only restaurant to allow their staff to show off their ink or colorful hair. I just wonder when the rest of America will get with it? 

But anyway, I loved Hodge's. My only regrets were NOT ordering the lobster corn dogs and the \"fluffer nutter\" dessert. Next time!"}
{"text":"Chris Hodgson has hit a home run.  Great atmosphere to start with .. very lively.  Service was prompt and excellent.  The server was fun and got it all right.  The food is very inventive and very, very good.  The Hanger Steak some of the tenderest I have ever had with a salsa on top (looked like chimichurri, but was not ... slight hint of Rosemary and very tasty).  The potato shards were both very crispy, yet very light and fluffy.  Love a place that can impart strong flavor profile and still keep it nice and light.  All the veggies were fresh and the green beans were wonderful.  The Unfried Chicken was excellent ... again flavorful, but not heavy at all and the Salmon was excellent as well.  They serve Mitchell's ice cream (a Cleves favorite) and even the dessert menu was inventive.  Best new place to open in a long time and congrats and a big thank you to Chris, who was in the kitchen working away.  An instant favorite and we will be back often.  BTW they serve you a very nice corn bread and some tater tots to start with ... great touch."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved it here. It was packed because there was a game going on, but we still got seated in 5 minutes. 
We started off with the animal tator tots- so delicious 
The cornbread that came with dinner was moist and just the perfect amount of sweet.
I ordered the shrimp and grits ( I've never had the dish before) and I was blown away! Usually I'm not a fan of thick creamy dishes, but this didn't feel too heavy. I ended up taking half as leftovers and it was SO GOOD the next day too!  The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because my husbands dish was just ok- the Ohio chicken with gnocchi and carrots and gravy. It was more on the bland side; he was choosing between that and crispy pork dish or the burger, and I think those might've been better options."}
{"text":"House provided starter with cornbread and maple butter is excellent.   

Hanky pany's (2) very tasty - are not too large to eat on your own and are a perfect app to share.   Didn't order the tots this time but they are always good too.

The scallops (3 large) were cooked perfectly and placed on a bed or corn risotto.  The fresh cilantro added to the taste of the risotto nicely.  

The seasoned shrimp and cheesy grits were nicely cooked - and rich.  The added chorizo sausage pieces added to the available combination of tastes.

The service was friendly, informative, and very prompt.  courses were nicely timed to not overlap and without huge time gaps between.  a few timely quality checks (no issues), water glasses filled, table cleared at each course.  Bill (The Damage) and payment processing was nice and quick.

Overall a great place for casual or a special evening out.  I can't believe patio season is over with :-(  looking forward to next spring !!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say this is one of the better restaurants I have been to in Cleveland.  The location is wonderful.  The physical space of the restaurant is great and the outdoor patio is tremendous.  As soon as you walk up to the patio, it's so inviting.  It's pretty much begging you to just take a seat and chill.  All this in downtown Cleveland...pretty amazing stuff.

First thing is first, everything about this place is high-quality.  Lazy Susan on the patio tables...nice.  Of course with high-quality dining comes high prices, though I would have to say that I got what I paid for.

The meal started off with tater-tots and cornbread appetizers which are both complimentary.  Both were absolutely delicious.  The cornbread was cooked nicely: crisp on the bottom and otherwise fluffy throughout.  The tater-tots were just about perfect as they were fried just right, had the right amount of salt, and came with a pretty solid sauce...don't know what was in it, but it's good.  Do note that the tater tots have bacon bits on top of them that can be brushed off.  If this is an issue for you, just ask your waiter to get you tater-tots without bacon.  

I ordered the french onion ravioli which was the weirdest thing I've ever seen.  It's like french-onion soup lightly poured over cheese ravioli.  One word: tremendous.  

For desert I had the brownie ice-cream.  The serving size was huge, as was the taste.  I could tell the brownie was fresh out the oven.  

Was this a pricey meal?  I'd be lying if I told you it wasn't.  But wow was it good.  The food is this weird American-fusion type cuisine that is definitely different, yet shows the creativity of the chef and his staff.  The execution is just about perfect.  

The service was okay.  I think minor lapses in service was due to the fact that we made a reservation for a party of 6, yet 1 didn't show, so that perhaps confused the waiters at first resulting in somewhat slow service.  The service did later step up to desired pace.  

Check this place out if you're looking to spend a bit more than usual on a nice meal."}
{"text":"I went to Hodge's when I was town for work as a solo traveler trying to find somewhere open in Cleveland on a Sunday night!  I got the lobster mashed potatoes and thought they were pretty delicious and I also got the cobb salad.  I liked the salad, but thought it was a bit over priced for dinner when it said on the menu it was $8 and then they charged me $11.50 for a \"large\" cobb salad that I didn't realize I had ordered so that wasn't very cool.  Overall good experience though and the staff was quick and good."}
{"text":"NICE PLACE

Six of us had dinner here and had a lovely meal. I had the Hanger Steak with Creamed Corn and Crispy Onions on top. The creamed corn was fabulous; the crispy onions were OK, if sparse; and the steak itself was good although I ordered it medium and it came out definitely medium rare. I ate it, but was a little disappointed.

Before the meal, they brought out a small cornbread for the table, just enough for one small piece for each person. In the center of the table there were 2 wooden plates on which to put two dishes of cornbread for a table of six, but the server never brought a second one, and we didn't want to be obnoxious and request it. The cornbread we had, by the way, was delicious.

{"text":"Fantastic food and a great atmosphere. The cornbread, wings, and tots are all amazing."}
{"text":"The food here was AWESOME! We shared the deviled eggs, Cleveland smorgasbord, sweet corn bisque, race letter animal tots, blue crab hush puppies, fried oysters, and cheesy grits. I think the oysters, grits, and smorgasbord were my favorites, ESPECIALLY the grits! The FIANCÉ, as of yesterday :) ,had the mean green to drink. I tried it and it was very good and refreshing, and I'm usually not a fan of brown liquor. We will definitely be back next time we're in Cleveland for dinner instead of a bunch of appetizers!"}
{"text":"My first time at Hodges.  I stopped for Happy Hour on a Friday afternoon at 5:00ish.  Nice after work crowd.  Happy Hour menu promotes several wines for $5.  I opted for the Pinot Grigio, which was just ok and Appetizers are $2.00 off.  I ordered the goat cheese tart.   The manager appeared shortly thereafter stating the the tarts would not be ready for another 30 minutes.  There was nothing else on the appetizer menu that I really had a taste for.   The bartender suggested the winter greens salad.  I responded that I was looking something just a little more substantial.  She offered an order of the house cornbread to accompany the salad.   I placed the order.  The salad arrived and I was a bit underwhelmed.  Don't get me wrong, it was well made but just a bit disappointing since I was looking forward to the goat cheese tart.  The salad serving was small for $8.  There was a small handful of various lettuces along with a few walnuts, bleu cheese crumbles and very thinly sliced apples. The addition of more lettuce would have left me a little more satisfied.  The cornbread with the accompanying maple butter was just ok as well.   Overall, I left hungry.   The staff was great, and eager to please.  I will definitely return, just not for Happy Hour:-("}
{"text":"Eight of us went on a Saturday night. Service was not too bad, but not great by any means.  Two out of eight meals were undercooked.  One of them was the Salmon, and the other was Chicken.  The chicken was completely red when cut into which was alarming.  Overall I do not believe any of us left unhappy, but really not much reason to return soon."}
{"text":"just finished lunch with friends.
food was so so but very disturbed
at the female manager who was loudly berating 
someone on the phone. owner needs to provide
counseling & improve her communication & interpersonal
skills which she has (none). due to this outburst which many
patrons heard.     we will \"not\" be back. !!
maybe she is better suited in the fast food industry.??"}
{"text":"Salmon and risotto is great and they have great salads for lunch. Cool place, clean, great staff. Menu changes so if you visit often, you don't get bored!"}
{"text":"I loved Hodges!!! I kept hearing my co workers talk about it so decided I had to give it a try. I don't even know where to begin.

The corn bread... Oh wow the corn bread. It melted in my mouth and was hands down the best bread of any kind I have ever tasted. I would go back just for that corn bread.

My boyfriend and I shared the tots which were anything but healthy but also anything but ordinary. We then split the shrimp and grits which were divine. The best Southern comfort food ever!!!! 

Definitely not a cheap meal-- but you get what you pay for. I will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"The beautiful patio was a perfect place to enjoy the absolutely incredible duck Mac n cheese. Spacious, good service, and a fantastic drink menu all made for a fantastic evening. 
The cornbread was also to die for. We were pleasantly surprised at finding this place."}
{"text":"Overall a little above average experience (3.5 stars). Service was good, although the bread was late on delivery. Cesar salad was good. Mac and cheese also good. Scallops with risotto tasted good. Taste was all there; plating was sloppy and scallops looked like they were cooked by a rookie. Cocktails were delicious. Menu speaks to upscaled food, but delivery of this was not executed."}
{"text":"The cornbread is a little piece of heaven served in cast iron that is hot as hell.

Great atmosphere with possibly the most comfortable dining chairs in northeast Ohio. This is a great place for large groups and couples alike.

With a menu that will make you question whether you are on the Gulf Coast or the Lake Erie Coast (while the skylights remind you that you are, in fact, in Cleveland), the portion sizes and prices are set properly to allow you to enjoy several courses without breaking your belt or bank account.

The food is great but had a couple of misses on the night we dined. The kitchen continues to perform strongly and I will definitely be back with the hopes that a 5 star review is within grasp."}
{"text":"Wow. I was looking for something incredible after eating at Tremont Taphouse last night (also 5 stars) and this place is different but equally worthy of 5 stars. First of all Wednesdays are 1/2 price bottles of wine so that drew us in. Then we had the animal tots. Tater tots that will kick your ass they're so good. And the cornbread is the best cornbread I've ever had. Hands down. 
I ordered the wedge salad which was just ok. But my husband ordered the Mac n cheese which was amazing and the wings which were a sweet and spicy combo. Also amazing. Great patio too."}
{"text":"We came in for their happy hour on a Saturday evening. I would definitely recommend! They have great deals on appetizers, and drinks with everything being about half their normal price. We couldn't believe the total bill for all the drinks, and food we got! They were also very fast to get our food out once we ordered.

Both the drinks, and food were very good. We ordered the potstickers (our favorite), the duck confit flatbread, and the snack trio (deviled egg, hanky panky, and devils on horseback). We also ordered all three of the happy hour special drinks, and I would recommend all of them!

Great happy hour spot before heading to The Q, for sure!"}
{"text":"Went with a party of 4 for restaurant week. The food was delicious and what a great deal $40 for an appetizer, 2 meals, and a bottle of wine (which they offer every Tuesday). Our waitress was great, very knowledgeable on the menu and suggested the shrimp and grits which were awesome! The only downfall were the hostess. We made a reservation and they seated us at stable right by the door which we kindly asked if there was another table available. After it seemed like a major hassle we were told everything was book for people who made reservations; again which we did. After brushing it off we notice during our entire meal there were 2 tables available the whole time. We even offered to wait but they made it seem impossible. The server and the meal made up for it though because I would definitely visit again but they should have kinder hostess considering they are the first impression"}
{"text":"It's possible that I could be a little biased, but this place has the best burgers in Cleveland!
The atmosphere is great and its super chill inside! Outside is another story....UHM HELLO? They have a fire piton the patio! What could be better then sitting around a fire pit in the evening having your delicious drinks brought right to you? 
The location is a little hidden, but once you find it you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location. Great patio!!! But the food and service lacked. I was the only one there, and asked a manager if they were open/serving. I waited a good ten minutes before the server came over to take my order (including drinks.) I ordered the lobster roll. Eh. The meat tasted still frozen and watery. The tater tots were good though. Bartender never came back out to check on me or my food. I must say I probably won't come back for the food, but I will come back for the patio."}
{"text":"First off, the food was on-point.  The BLT salad with ranch was legit.  The CAB burger was stellar.  The beef stroganoff was perfect.  And to top it off, our waiter, Steven, was amazing.  He really took care of my allergy issues, and I appreciated that the most.  Top notch service."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp and grits here because I saw quite a few people recommended it. I've had plenty of shrimp and grits before from different restaurants in San Francisco and LA but I've never had anything as salty as this one. It was so salty that it was almost inedible and I love salt to begin with. I always put more salt on my food but I could not for the life of me handle this amount of salt they put in their shrimp and grits. I really do hope it was just a one time off where the cook had a bad day but I'm beginning to notice a pattern in a lot of restaurants in Cleveland where the chefs just use too much salt in their dishes that it overwhelms other flavors. Please consider toning down the salt and I'm sure the dish would turn out wonderful!"}
{"text":"A hostess can ruin the night.  

We had reservations for 8 pm on a saturday night.  We arrived and, although we requested the patio, they seat FCFS on the patio and reservations are for the inside (???) which did not make sense.  The inside was empty.  Anyhow the hostess was a crotch us us.  Just not nice. She gave us crap for wanting to sit outside vs. taking a reservation for 6 INside.  Who wants to sit inside on a 80 degree night?  We don't get very many nice days in the CLE.

So after a 20 minute wait, we had some drinks at the bar.  The drinks, although delish, were unnecessarily overpriced.  Some of the drinks were upwards of $15 per. I just can't understand the pricing structure unless the market supports it and downtown, it appears that it does. 

We were finally sat at a round table that was, at the most, for four.  Six was CRAMPED and our hostess with the mostess was flagged down, and with some snark and an eyeroll, said she'd TRY to find a table for us.  Why the hell would you sit us at a table that would not accommodate plates and drinks for 6?

The server was prompt and nice, knew the menu.  Had us sold on the peanut butter and jelly dessert that they were sold out of...how do you run out of PB&J?  They are also known for their tots..of which they ran out?  Really?  how do you run out of tots? Was Sysco sold out?  

Drinks were on time, food was prompt and hot.  

Three stars for missing menu items, hostess bitchiness issues and lack of managerial oversight.  It was an okay dinner, but if you ask me if I want to go to Hodge's for dinner?  Its not on my top ten list that's for sure."}
{"text":"We arrived for our reservations around 6:30 on a Sunday. The place was practically empty save for a few souls at the bar. There were a number of couples seated on the patio enjoying the relatively warm July weather, but we opted to sit inside to get the full experience of the place. 

For starters, this place is huge. According to their website it's 4,400 square feet and seats 240 guests. Damn. Not bad for a guy who got his start working a food truck. Anyway, the décor. I'm no design expert but if I had to paint a picture I'd say upscale barn. The place is loaded with country kitsch, raw wood covered walls, metal tables and, wait for it, red leather. Other Yelpers have been a bit hard on the interior. I think it works, just not sure why. 

The service was pretty good. Our server was very nervous for some reason and attempted to fill every single moment with awkward chit chat. I'm all for friendly, but this was just over the top. He proceeded to stop back at our table every five minutes to ask how everything was. Don't get me wrong, he was nice enough, just way too much. Maybe it was because we were his only table.

The beer list isn't all that impressive. If memory serves, there were a handful of bottles and maybe half a dozen taps. I managed to find Bell's Lager of the Lakes on tap. A rather crisp Pilsener style beer that I thought was light and refreshing. Another shortcoming of our server was that he was clearly not educated when it came to beer. I had to ask several times exactly what beer I was being served before he finally asked the bartender for me. Telling me it's a lager doesn't give me much to go on. A minor annoyance, I know.

The food. After all, that's why we're here, right? If I had to peg the style I'd say it's somewhere between Southern comfort food and new American. Our experience started off right with two free munchies - tots and cornbread. Both were tasty, unexpected diversions. The tots were crispy, fried perfectly and paired with a red pepper aioli while the cornbread, served in a mini cast iron skillet, was mildly sweet and served with plenty of butter. Here's the rest of the meal:

Deviled eggs - a single egg split and deviled with pickled beet and horseradish garnish. I didn't think this dish was anything special. The filling was creamy and smooth but a tad underseasoned for my taste.

Pish sticks - four rectangles of juicy house-smoked pulled pork coated in seasoned bread crumbs and black and white sesame seeds and fried crispy golden. Served with a nice helping of cilantro, sesame mayo dip.  I could have made a meal out of these alone.

Some sort of salad - I don't remember if this was on the menu or if it was a special; red and green leaf lettuce, cornbread croutons, goat cheese, dried cranberries and strawberry vinaigrette. There was supposed to be candied pistachios - we had to dig to find one. Not a bad salad, but the ratios were off.

House-brined pork chop -- The chop, nicely marked and cooked a perfect medium, was set atop a bed of whipped potatoes and braised greens, topped with a veal demi glace. Overall, not a bad dish. I thought the greens were a touch too acidic and I didn't get the garbanzo beans. The smoked apple relish was also left off the dish.

Hodge's honey ribs -- House-smoked ribs lightly coated in a honey mustard sauce and served atop a cold sherry slaw. Not a bad offering. I normally expect my ribs to be falling off the bone and these required more tooth work. The meat was tasty and I liked the honey mustard sauce but the underdressed slaw didn't add all that much.

I really liked the overall look and feel of Hodge's and I wholly support their \"source local\" mantra. The menu is full of interesting dishes that are sure to provide years worth of patients to the Cleveland Clinic's cardiologists (did I see whipped lard as an app?). For me, they just fell a bit short on the execution. Maybe this will come in time."}
{"text":"Why'd I wait so long to go to Hodge's? I loved it so much, I went twice in one week!

Lunch: enjoyed the crispy chicken sandwich with tots. To.Die.For

Happy Hour/Dinner: imbibed on a $5 Moscow Mule (holla!) and had the scrumptious mac 'n' cheese. How about that cornbread, though? Dang.

I loved the big patio and the service was on point."}
{"text":"On a visit from DC, my boyfriend and I went here for dinner based on the great yelp reviews. They had a generous happy hour (5-7 Monday-Friday with specials on wine, beer, liquor, and appetizers. Their happy hour drinks were great. My boyfriend had their beer of the week and I had a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. We shared an appetizer of tater tots with pickled onion and cucumber, cheese, and kielbasa topped with a fried egg. It was a little under seasoned but I was impressed with the creativity of the dish. 

My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits as his main course which was phenomenal. Again, I felt it was under seasoned, but the grits were luscious and delicious and the shrimp was well cooked. I ordered the street corn risotto. It was somewhat cold when it got to the table and it needed some serious seasoning, but the flavors were good and the portion was generous. 

The decor is fantastic. It's very modern and trendy inside. The service was also great. Our waitress was very attentive and engaging. Overall, I was pleased with our dinner."}
{"text":"Burger just so so, not a lot of flavor for sixteen dollars.  Wife had Pork cutlet, also lacking in flavor.  First time in Cleveland and disappointed that this is listed as best burger in downtown.  In western Kentucky you could not stay in business serving this food."}
{"text":"Visually, the new place looks great. Warm, inviting, lively. Food was just OK for the money. Group had a wealth of their top appetizers, and 4 entrees. Was late, and definitely felt rushed by servers. To the point they cleared my $10 drink that was only 1/2 gone.  Trip to bathroom revealed two staff members in an apparent drug deal.  Not cool."}
{"text":"I wasn't happy with our table. We were next to an aisle with an almost constant stream of people going past us BUT I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I had salmon which was cooked perfectly. Usually when I order salmon it ends up being over cooked, but this was not. The accompanying orzo had a pretty good balance of the 5 tastes (sweet, bitter, salty, sour and umami) just a little too much sweet and too much horseradish but still pretty good.  My daughter had the pork cutlet with fettuccine alfredo which was very flavorful with a nicely breaded, crispy cutlet. We will definitely be back and I will request a better table next time."}
{"text":"Really interesting,  good food.  Great great service.  Fun cocktails.  Clean,  well done. ..just an all around first rate experience"}
{"text":"Big disappointment after all the hype.  If heavy very average pedestrian food is your thing, then this is your place!  highlight was the free tater tots and cornbread--got charged 2 bucks for a 2nd cornbread..come on, who ever heard of charging for what is essentially the only available house bread??  scallops were dry and portion small ( three).  Pork chop was dry and meally, covered in what seemed like the same unappetizing sauce you get at Rascal house with mozzarella sticks. ( now if you want a really good pork chop go to Mike Ditka's in Chicago)  French onion Ravioli were served floating in Campbell's onion soup.  Service was attentive, in fact over attentive--wait staff wouldn't leave us alone-- in fact they fought within earshot over who would serve our table.  The Mulled Manhatttan (11 bucks-major ripoff, read on) was interesting and tasty, but was the smallest drink I've ever been served:  about two tablespoons of cocktail in a Manhattan glass with a GIANT square ice cube occupying the space where my beverage should have been. 
My advice--take a pass and go around the corner to Lola, or Morton's, or Hyde Park, or Greenhouse, or, well, almost anywhere but Hodges!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about how great this place is!! The BF and I were in town for the weekend and we used yelp to find good seafood. Yelp led us here!! It was walking distance from the hotel, and they were busy but not \"crap, let's go somewhere else\" busy. We ordered a pineapple express (stronnnng) and an amaretto sour with cherries (yummy). The drinks were awesome and our waiter was very nice and friendly. 

BF ordered the scallops and I got the shrimp and grits.  Now, I know you might be thinking \"shrimp and grits? In Cleveland?\" but I am so serious, this dish was amazing!!! If I wasnt worried about funny looks I would've licked the damn bowl clean, I swear! BF loved his scallop dish and we were both in the clean plate club!! 

I highly highly recommend coming here if you're downtown!!! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Cornbread here is the best in the city! Super sweet and has a sweet butter to go with it. Everything I've tried here on the menu has been very delicious. The service is also great! They have a huge patio which is perfect for the sunny days in Cleveland. Heard about some happy hour specials that I definitely want to check out!"}
{"text":"Wow what a chicken sandwich! So I went here for lunch since I am withing walking distance. Seriously why did I wait to try this place out! Chris's menu is innovative while still sticking to some traditional comforts. I decided to try the friend chicken sandwich and it came with tots and aioli. The sandwich was juicy and cooked to perfection. Had a little spicy to it with the jalapeno slaw but it was just the right amount of spice. The tots were crispy and the aioli was also made to perfection. I highly recommend if your looking for a low key joint downtown for lunch Chris Hodgson knows how to make some damn good food!"}
{"text":"Very subpar food. Service was great, drinks were good and the cornbread was amazing but our entrees were ok at best."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped in for dinner on a Sunday night on our road trip back from Christmas. The place was a little empty (we were the last to be seated that night), but we were warmly welcomed. The wine and beer list was great - they had a delicious local beer of the month for only $4 which was a good steal. 

We ordered a bunch of appetizers since we couldn't settle on one thing. The duck and squash flatbread was my favorite thing, along with the house made cornbread that comes served in a skillet. We also had the goat cheese tarte, which was tasty too. I wasn't a huge fan of the deviled eggs - they were a little bland for my taste. 

Overall a really enjoyable experience - would definitely go again next time I find myself in Cleveland."}
{"text":"the dining room and bar were filled last night. the server was very attentive, almost too push though to get our orders in ASAP.  I wish servers could cue in when people want to talk for awhile them order.  Food & drinks: First of all I am a true believer that a moscow mule should always be served in a copper cup- it's just how I learned to drink them.  I was not crazy about the rox glass.the cornbread and maple butter were very good.  i didn't try the tater tot amuse-bouche.  We had the mussels and artichoke for an appetizer that was good.  We ordered 2 entree's, the french onion ravioli which was OK- but not that unique.  The duck dish was great, nice portion size.  The strawberry basil cobbler was a kinda runny.  i wish there were more chocolate selections."}
{"text":"Just when we thought there was no good food to be had in Ohio....this place was amazing! After getting in pretty late, we stopped in for a late-ish dinner and to decompress from a long driving day. We ordered the burbon flight, the tater tots, mussels, and soup. 

My husband was excited to try the burbon flight. It was a nice variety of liquor that we haven't tried. He loved the beer and cheese soup. It was perfect for a cold day and very satisfying. I completely fell in love with the mussels. The curry, korean sausage and cilantro worked perfectly together. I could have eaten giant bowls of that stuff. I even ordered extra bread to soak up all the curry goodness. The 2 pieces of extra bread were $2. We shared the tater tots, and yes, get them. Don't think, just order. 

The restaurant was in a nice area that looks like there are a bunch of bars and clubs around. I would stop here for an early dinner before going out for a night on the town!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good food and service. Nice place to visit when you are in downtown."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Hodge's on MLK day just before the Cavs game.  We had a reservation and were promptly seated.  The entire front of house staff wore Cleveland gear, which was a really great show of support for the city.  

I started with a Mean Green, which was a really great drink.  Crisp, refreshing, and just flat out tasty.  It would be, (and will be), even better in the summer. Appetizers followed suite with great flavors.  The Hanky Pankies have an amazing jam on top. My wife also had the Broccoli Cheese Soup, which was INCREDIBLE.  Such a great choice on a cold Cleveland winter day.  The extra zip of the korean chili flakes really make the dish special. 

Entrees were also excellent. The Salmon was served on a bed of really fantastic fried rice that mixed perfectly with the fruit salsa on the fish.  It was cooked to a perfect medium and was really great.  We also had the mac and cheese, which deserves to be called something higher than mac and cheese.  It was familiar and comfortable but with a huge amount of additional flavors.  It was well balanced and amazingly good.

We finished the meal with the cookie sundae.  If there's Mitchell's Ice Cream involved, I'm in. This was one of the most satisfying desserts I've had at a downtown restaurant in quite some time.  I'm not big on sweets, but this sundae makes me think I could learn.  

This review is actually more of a 4.5 / 5 instead of just a 4.  I'd give higher marks, but I've had better service at other places.  Service wasn't bad, but there were instances when we waited just a little too long to be asked for our order.  We also weren't asked if we wanted dessert.  But, this is nitpicking on my part.  

All in all, a great meal and a great experience.  I'm excited for a second visit and to try many more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I work across the street from Hodge's, yet it has taken me months to finally go there for dinner. There has been a lot of publicity lately since Chef Hodge was on the Food Network so I figured it was definitely worth trying. They brought us a small treat of tater tots and aioli mayonnaise to begin with. I always think it's a nice gesture when a restaurant gives you a free treat to begin with. We tried the pierogi's as our appetizer. I have since this time been back to Hodge's twice just to eat the pierogi's. They are one of the tastiest things I've eaten in my life!! They are served with roasted shallots, green onions and some type of foam on top. There are only two, but they are plenty filling. For my main dish, I had the walleye over a bed of sweet potato puree and succotash. The fish was cooked perfectly and paired very well with the succotash. As for drinks, they have a great beer selection, good wine list and very fun cocktails to try, like the Moscow Mule served in a copper cup."}
{"text":"I am in from California for the weekend and have never been to Cleveland before. I wasn't sure what I was in the mood for but I found this place on yelp and since it was close by I thought I would give it a try. Going in with the intent of ordering a burger I was pretty sure my choosing process would go quickly. But as of yesterday, they added a new menu. Being from California, I love chorizo and two of the \"snacks\" had chorizo in them. I can't remember their names but I know that one of them was bacon wrapped dates that were stuffed with chorizo-absolutely delicious! The other was chorizo with melted cheese on a crostini, this one was my favorite out of the two. The date taste with the meat combination was a little too sweet for my taste, and the crostini snack was more savory. I really thought I was sold on a burger until I looked over the menu where the wild mushroom gnocchi just made my mouth water. The service was really fast and the waiter very attentive. My meal came out and tasted just as good as it sounded. I was very pleased. It seemed like a popular place but not anything too crowded. I went in at around 630-700pm on a friday. I didn't feel it was that expensive, roughly ten for the two snacks and then i think 11 bucks or so for the gnocchi dish. They have a very cute way of giving you your bill. They give you your bill underneath an envelope that reads DAMAGE. I got out of there with my \"damage\" at only about $23, having eaten much more than I needed too. Which, to me is a decent price for the amount of food I ate."}
{"text":"Was visiting Cleveland for a conference and came here with a friend. I ordered the fried chicken, which came with grits, cornbread, hot sauce, and jalapeno slaw. The chicken was pretty good - not the best I've ever had but decent. The hot sauce really complemented it. The grits were yummy. I do not always enjoy grits but I thought these were flavorful. The cornbread was tasty, very sweet but I did not mind that. Unfortunately the jalapeno slaw was disappointing. The flavors did not meld well I thought.

While I visited, the place was not busy at all (we came for an early dinner before 6pm). The service was good and I enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great menu!   Flavorful, diverse and great presentation.  Good vibe in the dining room and bartender engaging.  Has outdoor patio as well!  Goat cheese tart excellent though it will cost you an extra 10 minutes at the gym."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner. It was an OK experience. I was fairly disappointed with the back room area, where we sat. The front space is really charming and warm; the back space is somewhat austere, cold and bland. I also had a LOT of difficulty finding the venue, which apparently all the locals experienced as well. Maybe some street-side signage would help, since the entrance is tucked away on the side? 

Beer selection deserves 4 stars- I was very impressed with the local beers on offer -I would have appreciated a handwritten list, but our server was very helpful in providing some suggestions. 

Food was OK but not stellar. The shrimp and grits were apparently an exception (according to a fellow diner), but it looked too heavy/creamy for my taste. I had the Bay of Fundy Salmon, which was OK but frankly, pretty bland. I enjoyed the appetizers more, which included the Pot Stickers (unique), Deviled Eggs, and Duck Confit Flatbread. Net result of the meal was a bit of an upset stomach all day the next day, which speaks to the heaviness of the food. 

Probably won't be going back, but it might be a better experience if I were to go for a personal (vs business) reason and sat at the bar."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with our dinner at Hodge's on the Saturday before Valentine's Day. They were able to accommodate our last minute reservation and that was just the start of their great service. Our waitress was attentive and patient and made great recommendations.

We had Hodge's Punch cocktails which were fruity and tasty. The cornbread was a delightful surprise instead of bread and it came with sweet butter (I think it's made with maple syrup). Definitely one of the most delicious cornbreads I've ever tasted!

We started with the succatash salad (arugula, beets, pickled cauliflower, corn, and other goodies in a white balsamic dressing. It was light and refreshing and soooo good!

For entrees, I had the shrimp and grits (smooth, creamy, rich) - the tomatoes were a great touch! My friend had the pork cutlet which was crispy and surprisingly spicy. The accompanying pasta was very lemony and cheesy; the asparagus was perfectly cooked. 

We were too full for dessert, sadly!

Hodge's was a little difficult to find because there's not really a sign on Euclid. It's posted above what appears to be a parking garage, but at night it's not visible. The address is posted out front (the sign reads: six six eight) and that's how we found it. All in, we spent about $100 and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.

I would love to go during their happy hour to check that out, too!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Everyone raves about Hodge's happy hour and it definitely lives up to the hype! 
HH is M-Sat 4-630, ALL DAY Sunday! They also have specialty nights like trivia on Mondays. HH includes $5 cocktails, $2-3 beers and $5 wines along with a bunch of appetizers. We ordered drinks, snack trio, hodge's wings and the cab burger ($7). The snack trio is very small and is best for one. The cab burger on the other hand was basically a full sized burger with tater tots for $7! Great deal and very delicious. 
The ambiance is trendy and not overly fancy. Outside area is really nice- plenty of seating, separate bar and even a fire pit."}
{"text":"I was surprised how good the food was. I expected a burger and bbq joint for some reason. Boy was it so much more. The deviled eggs and hanky pankies are very tasty. I've wanted to try the steak, but wasn't too inspired from the menu description. For some reason, steak dishes seem to be the neglected dish of the restaurant world. I sat outside all 3 times I've been here, so I can't speak of the atmosphere inside. I do love the patio. Hodge's is in a perfect location in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"literally the most amazing food ever! everything i got was delicious! very experimental in the food combinations but every single one they've come up with is awesome!

try the mac and cheese! i know that the dates sound weird but it's amazing!"}
{"text":"First day of lunch service for Hodge's, and I came away impressed.  The restaurant retains much of the structure of Zinc, though thankfully absent are the much-too-cramped 2 person tables near the bar in favor of counter seating facing the open kitchen.  Zinc's curved booths just past the bar area (on the left) were replaced with more traditional banquette seating flush against the wall.  The long bar and patio area remain, leaving the prospect of it being an excellent happy hour spot once the weather warms up.  Service was friendly and efficient--I clocked 44 minutes, 50 seconds from the time I walked into the door to the time my credit card came back.

Started with the Chicken Liver Toast ($3) as an appetizer.  This is two pieces of toast covered in a heavy spread of chicken liver pâté and a little bit of olive oil.  Small bits of onions and herbs were added to provide a little extra flavoring, but given the rather large amounts already spread on the toast, this isn't an appetizer for those who might be slightly squeamish about chicken liver.

Table service also includes a 6\" skillet of cornbread with maple-bourbon butter.  Truthfully, if I knew this were coming, I would have passed on the Chicken Liver Toast.  The cornbread is pretty fluffy, and I love that they serve it piping hot.  It's also nice to see the cornbread served complementary when there is a trend of some restaurants charging for bread amidst the small plates phenomenon.  The maple-bourbon butter is also very good, relying more on the subtle maple taste instead of being too sweet.

The Le Cordon Blue Sandwich ($10) was excellent and worthy of a blue ribbon itself.  The dark meat cut of breaded chicken pairs perfectly with the relatively thick slices of bacon (which isn't fried to a crisp and retains a little bit of fat) and a not-overpowering amount of blue cheese.  The bun is an ordinary cafeteria-style sandwich bun (which I suppose is evocative of the restaurant's food truck roots) but toasted on the inside.  A rosemary parmesan aioli is provided on the side.  The sandwich comes with a side of tater tots served in a metal cup (like Lola Fries at B Spot).  The tots were too much on the oily and salty side.

The chef also randomly made a special lemongrass iced tea for lunch ($2.50).  With just a little bit of sweetness, this was a refreshing change from the usual lunchtime iced tea, but my understanding is that this was at the chef's whim and not necessarily a regular part of the menu.

I took a look at the wine list for good measure:  Most of the bottles were around the $30 level and topping out at just under $100 with a few exceptions.  The 2010 Cakebread Chardonnay at $77 but Yellow Label Veuve Clicquot at $110--both are about $45 at a retail store.  They also provided 9 whites, 12 reds, and 3 sparkling wines by the glass.

More so than any review, positive or negative, the true test will be whether Hodge's will be able to survive in that seemingly cursed space at 668 Euclid, despite (or because of) its proximity to the bustle of East Fourth.  I would proffer the next time you're thinking of Corner Alley, Zocolo, or Chocolate Bar for lunch, considering taking a few steps further down Euclid to Hodge's."}
{"text":"First start out by saying, I would go back again. Tator tots alone would be worth going back! The wedge salad was good, mushrooms great, mac & cheese was almost perfect, a tad bit salty. Wings were very good and the duck breast with hoisin sauce and fried rice was outstanding."}
{"text":"Warning: If you live in 668, this place is dangerous.  I've already been at least one a week since it opened - it's wonderful! 

Hodges is a fantastic addition to the East 4th Neighborhood.  The atmosphere is rustic and warm, the food is delicious (yet not pretentious), and the service and staff are wonderful! 

They do a great job of providing you with time to gaze over the menu full of many unique and interesting options as you sip on your cocktails.  To make that time even more enjoyable, they bring the table some complimentary tots and cornbread with a maple walnut butter that is just ... yum! 

I've vowed to not repeat an order here yet (so I can try all that this place has to offer) - but it's hard when I start craving some of their offerings! 

1) Burger - WOW, this is a burger.  It's so unique and delicious - a must try. 
2) The Chopped Wedge, add Salmon.  This is fresh, crisp and the Salmon was cooked beautifully. 
3) Brussels Sprouts and Asparagus - both of these veggie sides are great..  I've been known to just get these paired with a small plate or either the meatballs or the ribs.  

The patio just opened, which means my visits to Hodges may even start to increase - if that's possible :)"}
{"text":"round 2. so like, \"someone\" mustn't be in the kitchen anymore. loved the wings but everything was even one step down from our first experience there. why change that cornbread that was perfection? I mean, no bad food here, just a bit uninspired. and I'm not a fan of the room. not cool or pretty. BUT they do have a lovely patio where one can sit around a fire pit. good to know. chicken wings around a fire pit. life could be worse..."}
{"text":"So it's Restaurant Week and that just gives me another excuse to meet up with my foodie friends and grab a bite to eat. A fellow Yelper had never been to Hodge's before so we decided to meet up here since you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $30 during RW. We showed up early so we could sit at the bar and check out their happy hour menu and started out with some $3 beers and $5 specialty cocktails then added a couple $3-$6 small plates:

-Duck Confit Flatbread: OMG DELICIOUS! I didn't want to share, but I did. One slice.
-Snack Trio: You get one deviled egg which was nothing special, one hankie pankie which is this yummy meat and cheese concoction spread on a crostini, and one devil on horseback which is a bacon wrapped stuffed date which was okay.
-Side of Mac & Cheese: My friend got this and really enjoyed how the figs added a nice touch of sweetness to the dish.  

Later on after we closed out our bar tab we were seated upstairs for dinner. The upstairs is small intimate space overlooking the restaurant below. They have cool artwork on the walls of dictionary pages with screen prints of animals on them. It was 78 degrees up there per the thermostat though, so wear layers you can take off unless you're like my friend who loves it that toasty. Now for the food:

-Cup of Creamy Beer Cheese Soup: Missing the chives, but very good. Perfect balance of beer and cheese that I think would go great over a baked potato or even as a sauce for a pasta dish. 
-Cornbread: Yum! Buttery and slightly sweet with the perfect texture. You could eat it with or without butter or crumble it into your soup. 
-Ohio Chicken: This was my friend's dish, but I tasted it as well and we were both disappointed. The portion was huge, but everything was without flavor and they didn't even eat it. I think it would have been better if they had seasoned the chicken and had a gravy with it instead of the broth it came in. 
-Bay of Fundy Salmon: Looked great, but unfortunately this dish was also disappointing. The fried rice was good, but the salmon was plain and dry. I asked for a side of sauce, but that didn't work either and the dish went uneaten. 
-Chocolate Chip Skillet Cookie: The crust on this was great, nice and crispy. The inside was warm and gooey, but very loaded with chocolate, like a little too much even for me. Cookie went well with the Mitchell's ice cream though and the couple bites I had I enjoyed. Probably would have been better to share unless you're into diabetic comas. 

Management noticed we didn't enjoy our entrees and listened to our remarks when they asked us about our meal. I really appreciate a business that takes the time to see how their guests are enjoying their experience and does what they can to make that experience as best as it can be. They ended up taking financial responsibility for our dinner which was completely unexpected, but such a customer service friendly move that there is no way I can give this place low stars. 

All in all, my friend and I both agreed that we would definitely come back to Hodge's since the small plates and appetizers were great, we'll just stay at the bar next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here before going to Book of Mormon at Palace Theater.  It was amazing.  First off, we got free hash browns and corn bread then we ordered the hanky pankys that were delicious and classy at the same time they don't compare to my cheez whiz and Bob Evans sausage, but they were good.  The burgers were WONDERFUL!!  We left happy and full!"}
{"text":"It's unbelievable that this place has a 4 star average. Don't get me wrong, they have good food. But I've never been to a place with such consistently bad service. Servers taking forever to even show up and great you. Meals that take 2 hours when the restaurant is near empty. Several menu items out of stock. I'm sitting here in the restaurant waiting for a dessert I ordered half an hour ago after they told us that 2 of the five desserts on the menu were out of stock. 

Seriously, with better service, this place could be 5 stars. But I always leave mad about some aspect of the experience."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Hodge's. Had friends in from Germany and wanted to show them creative American style food.  The service was great and the food was better! Chris actually introduced himself to the table and chatted with us for a bit. Cleveland is fortunate to have a restaurant of this caliber."}
{"text":"I went to Hodge's this past weekend when I was visiting a friend in Cleveland. We went for dinner around 5:30 and it wasn't that crowded, especially for a Saturday. Our waitress was very good and the manager checked with us to see how everything was. The food came out fairly fast and was pretty good. She had the salmon and I had a chicken caesar salad. Overall, I would recommend it, especially during summer when the patio is open."}
{"text":"Truly a 3.5 star experience, but being a bit critical, I'll round down since it fell a bit short on the southern fare homage.  I had the deviled eggs and chorizo stuffed dates starters, and shrimp & grits for the entree. Cornbread was also served.  The deviled eggs had too much mayo in them, but the dates were delicious. The shrimp & grits were good this far north, but not memorable. The cornbread missed too with a taste that was a cross between cornbread and a sugar cookie."}
{"text":"Meh. 

I'm in Cleveland for a conference and we wanted to eat at a restaurant near our hotel and this place had a solid rating. 

We didn't get appetizers or alcohol because of sheer exhaustion, so this review will be short! I ordered the shrimp & grits with chorizo and I left a bit disappointed. The grits were wonderful & creamy and the shrimp were cooked pretty much perfectly. The dish just had noooooo seasoning. I expected a really complex flavor profile and I got nothing. It was a beautiful looking dish - it just fell flat. 

The service was decent and the decor in the restaurant was ok. They have incredibly comfortable chairs and after a day of emails, meetings, and a 3 hour drive, those chairs felt great!  

I will add that my colleague got the Caesar salad with crispy bacon, however, she described it as thick and rubbery. 

The end."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner before attending a concert downtown. It was a Saturday night and we had made reservations (highly recommended). We were able to be seated right away when the wait was a half hour. I know they were crazy but the downside to the visit was the service. The waitress seemed bothered and didn't stay around our table for a long time. The positive was the food. My friend and I split 2 apps- The Blue Crab Hushpuppies and Devils on Horseback. So good! We wanted to eat something filling so we wouldn't be hungry during the concert so I got the Braised CAB Beef, which is essentially a pot roast. It was extremely filling. I wish I would've ordered something a little lighter but it was very good. I would recommend this restaurant. They have a really nice patio for the summer months and it looks like they have good happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Went to hodges on a friend recommendation tonight. Drinks were really good and appetizers were very developed in flavor (gnocchi and crab hush puppies). Had the Hodge burger and OMG it was out if this world!!! Everything from the pretzel bun to the salty bacon to the dill spread was  delectable! Can't wait to go back and have another..., pretty sure ill be dreaming of that burger in my sleep. Tater tots were also a fun throwback side dish. Service and management were friendly  and abundant, constantly checking in and walking about. Will definitely return. :)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic to grab a bite before a night on East 4th or--my personal favorite--before seeing a show in Playhouse Square! The happy hour menu is great! My friend and I got some apps to share, and really enjoyed all of them! We got the chicken wings confit, each got a trio (great call!), and a mushroom and braised beef flatbread! We really enjoyed all of them and the Happy Hour prices are reasonable. We may have just found our new pre-show spot!"}
{"text":"I visited here for lunch before a Cleveland Indians game.  Interesting location, a little hard to find, back from the sidewalk on Euclid.  Once inside, it is a busy, bustling bar/diner motif.  Lunch menu was nice, good selection of appetizers and entrees.  Beer cheese soup was awesome.  Crab hushpuppies are great.  The lobster roll was among the best I have ever had.  They also have a lunch box special, which includes soup, salad and half sandwich.  Beer and wine selections were a little limited but good.  Service was friendly and spot on.  This is a place I would like to go back to again, probably for dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered the burger. It was pretty mediocre. I finished it, but I wasn't really pleased. The sauce on the burger may have just been mayonnaise. It came with some reasonably good tater tots -- nice and crispy, albeit a little greasy. I'm not one for tater tots anyway, so they did not rescue the meal for me.

The bartender told me some interesting new things about alligators though, so that was a plus."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 3 stars because you can't break the rating down between service and food. One was supreme; the other lacked greatly. 

We waited a lengthy time for drinks when we were first sat and it took so long that two servers that were not ours asked us if anyone had even helped us. I asked two people for water and never got any. We were told our complimentary tots would be out in a few seconds and they never arrived, despite the fact that the two tables that were sad after us received theirs immediately. Our drinks arrived literally minutes before our entrees and appetizer arrived approximately 30 seconds after our entrees. Huh? We asked twice for silverware and finally had to find another server to get us some so we could actually eat. We requested water twice again and my husband literally had to get up and stand in front of our server to stop him and look him in the face and say the word water - again. I asked for a second glass of wine and at the 15 minute wait mark my husband got up to get the manager. The excuse was there were two large parties and the bar was backed up, so he paid for the wine and removed the appetizer that was ice cold. A few of the people from tables close to ours actually joked with us and told us they were happy to share their server with us. It was that obvious to other diners that our service was that poor. That's where Hodge's loses stars. 

Their only redemption was the food. We ate at a more popular and well-known Cleveland restaurant the prior evening and it was pretty standard fare, nothing exceptional. At Hodge's, I had the seared scallops with a New England clam chowder risotto and it was unquestionably one of the best meals I have had in a very long time. It's hard to find a place so far from the coast that can perfectly sear a scallop and it was absolutely perfect. My husband had the duck mac & cheese and was also incredibly happy with his meal. Next time we pass through Cleveland, we will definitely stop again."}
{"text":"Love one of the latest additions to the downtown landscape of restaurants.  Food is fresh and delicious. Service has been top-notch and the price is right considering the quality."}
{"text":"Hodge's is undoubtably a fantastic restaurant and the food is outstanding. However, I had to voice my disappointment in our last visit there for lunch. My crispy chicken sandwich was fantastic! However, my wife was not happy with her romaine lettuce wedge, which was just that ... a lettuce wedge with some skimpy toppings. It was pretty much like eating a salad of lettuce alone... for $11! In addition, the service was almost non-existent. I voiced my disappointment through the website, but haven't heard a word. I wasn't looking for retribution, just an apology and maybe a promise to try for improvement. Thus, the 3-star rating."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We went in predisposed to liking Hodges but our server soon took care of that. It was some of the worst service I have ever experienced. It took forever (over 20 minutes) to get our initial drink order 25 feet from the bar to our table. Then he was visibly upset that we wanted to actually sit and enjoy our drinks for a minute before rushing into dinner. From that point on he was MIA. We had to get up and go grab him from another table in order to get a second round of drinks. Then do the same to order our meals. Let me say that all of the food actually tasted good. However, 3 of our 4 entrees arrived cold, 2 of our 3 appetizers were badly overcooked and, again, we couldn't find him to be able to tell him that. We had another group of friends dining there that same night (9/15) and all of their meals had to be comped as well. Judging from the other reviews they must be capable of having good nights and good service but we sure didn't experience that. Not in a big rush to return."}
{"text":"OH! My! Goodness!!!!!  This place right here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My friend and I went here for dinner right before attending Trap Karaoke at the House of Blues.  And I fell in love!!!!  I have been bragging about this place to everyone.

First off, I want to give a shoutout to our amazing waitress Julia!!!!!  She was definitely on top of her game that evening.  She was patient, helpful, quick, and sweet!  Julia you are THE best!

I swear everything we ordered at this restaurant was delicious!  Two things.... 1. they have a drink called the bee hive!!!  So you know I had to order it since I am apart of Beyoncé's Bee Hive.  It was good!  2. their table bread was cornbread!!!!!!!!!!!!  Let me repeat that one more time for the folks in the back.... Their table bread is CORNBREAD!  Honey, child!!!!  It was one of the best cornbread I have ever tasted!!!! I am getting hungry right now just thinking about it!

For our appetizers we ordered veggie pot stickers and I was basically licking the plate clean!  I had to order two because I ate most of the first order without sharing with my friend.  For our main entrée we ordered the mushroom ravioli!!!  And that was good!

A few of our friends met us a little later and they ordered the chicken nachos that looked good.  

It was by chance that we tried this place out but I am thanking the heavens that we did!  I will for sure be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, outdoor sitting available with fireplace.  Service is great. Server, Faydra, suggested a dish off the menu, (pasta with mushrooms) which was delicious    

The food was exceptional. We had tomato bisque soup, the pasta dish and the hanger steak. The food was tasteful and not overcooked. Spiced just right. 

I asked to try the Malbec and Faydra was very accommodating. Good wine selections and a full bar. 

If we were locals, we'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is racist towards Arabic people Specially hijab they asked me to go to anther place they were rude with me and kept serving other people and  ignore me."}
{"text":"Although the server was probably new - I would say that she was not well trained.  We had some issues and asked to talk with the manager who never came over?  Kind of embarrassing since we made these reservations and invited friends to join us.  So of course it was our friend that had the issue.

I will cut them some slack since it appeared they were not ready for the Maroon 5 concert crowd. But... really?

Food seemed to either be very good or lacking in quality. So consistency was a big issue."}
{"text":"My mom and I came to Hodge's for dinner on a Thursday night while I was in Cleveland for a wedding. We sat outside on the patio since there was a nice breeze and it wasn't too humid. Our waitress was phenomenal, extremely attentive and very engaging. We started with a glass of red wine to chat and catch up as well as an order of the potstickers.

The wine and the potstickers came out quickly and both were delicious. For our main course, I ordered the salmon with the couscous salad. My mom ordered a steak that was supposed to be a very tender cut of beef from the shoulder of the animal.

My salmon was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. But the couscous salad was really the winner of my dish. Mixed in with the couscous were sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, arugula, and some type of sweet potato. The entire salad had a wonderfully balanced creamy dressing. I inhaled the entire thing. I highly recommend this dish to anyone eating at Hodge's. 

I also tried a bite of my mom's steak and it was so tender and juicy that it melted in your mouth. Her dish was served with asparagus and mashed potatoes. We both left the meal satisfied with the food, the wine, and each other's company."}
{"text":"Hodges, one of our favorite restaurants hands down.  We went with another couple who says the same thing, last night!  But woah on the sodium!  Everything we ate (entire party agreed) was overly salted.  We had the animal style tater tots, market salad (also salty), and I personally had the pumpkin soup, also very salty.  Friends had the meatloaf and a burger.  The food was barely tolerable, to be honest.  Salt sits on the table for a reason so please, less salt!  We love you, Hodges."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late dinner. They have a beautiful patio that is huge with fireplaces. Interesting \"tapas\" menu. Seems more like a list of apps and regular dinners. The burger was good, the tater tots were better. Duck wings were delicious, rich dark meat with a delicious spicy sauce. An extra star for the great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first experience at this restaurant was when it first opened and like most restaurants, they were working out the kinks. However, 2 years later, they still have the same kinks. We sat out on the patio bar on a Friday night before a show at Hilarities. We got drink and food menus right away, but then the service went downhill from there. My boyfriend ordered a manhattan and after his first was finished, prior to getting our dinner, he was not offered another drink, nor was I. I have had hit-or-miss food here, and this night was a miss. I ordered the charcuterie board and all the bread on this was stale. The boyfriend ordered the burger which seems to be the only dish they can't mess up. I will say that one redeeming aspect of this restaurant is the cornbread -it is excellent. But I'm not about to try this place again just for a piece of bread. They really need to step up their service and food quality game here. Otherwise it's going to be a patio for the birds."}
{"text":"We picked Hodge's because of Yelp's reviews and location. Good choice! My husband had steak with lobster sauce and he raved about it all through the meal. I had a shrimp po'boy and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The best was the cornbread. Warm sweet and delicious. We ate on the patio and enjoyed a nice warm evening. Our server was so attentive to us and was very friendly. I'm sorry I forgot her name, but she said she had worked there for 5 years. People like that are hard to find. Thanks for listening to our stories. Also I would like to thank the ones that prepared our food. Outstanding job! We planned on taking 1/2 the cornbread to have in the morning, but on the way back to our hotel we saw a man eating out of a garbage can. It was a hard choice, but we are pleased we could share it with him. I guess we will just have to go back to Hodge's tomorrow and get more cornbread for us."}
{"text":"Went there for girls night out...I knew about the comp apps but it was a nice surprise getting the tater tots and corn bread...the corn bread is to die for...so good. Portion sizes are great and the food was delicious! The location is a bonus...walking distance to E. 4th and the casino. Would go again."}
{"text":"We went on Valentine's Day. They had really good food and wonderful service. The hostess was really friendly and assume. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Located in an alley. 
Friendly staff. Neat place.  Nice patio.  
Awesome food!
Here's the food low down: for starters,
The chicken mayo deviled eggs - Devine!
I did not notice any chicken in there, but the taste made me say who cares! 
Goat cheese tart- DE-LISH! 
The cornbread skillet they serve everyone w/a maple butter- gimme more!
Entrees- mushroom stuffed chicken- very good!
Ribeye with blue cheese and fingerling potatoes- good 
Scallops with potato gnocchi and beef cheek and carrots- yes, yes, yes!
We were in a slight hurry, we didn't have drinks or dessert, but what we did have will definitely bring us back for more!

Came back for dinner again- roasted chicken is soooooo yummy especially with the pesto on the side.  Shrimp & grits w/chorizo also excellent!  I'm pretty sure anything in the menu will be good!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Cesar salad, fried chicken sliders, and C.A.B. burger. The Caesar salad was alright. It wasn't bad, but I have had better Caesar salad. The fried chicken sliders were pretty good, but the fried chicken weren't the type of fried chicken I was expecting. I thought it would be the typical crunchy fried chicken, but it was actually more like the bbq chicken than fried. The C.A.B. burger was good too. But it wasn't anything incredible like you have to try it. Overall, I enjoyed my food but I wouldn't purposely go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Still my favorite hidden gem in Cleveland.  I say \"hidden\" because it's not on E. 4th, but that's why I like it.  It's super approachable, unpretentious, and everything from soup to nuts is great.

The lunchbox is an awesome deal for those looking for a midday variety.  It's not a substitute for a $5 lunch, but is what your looking for if you want soup, salad, AND some sandwich - all always good (the pork, bacon, lettuce, tomato is a fav sandwich) - and $13.50 isn't a big deal.  Worth it.

The tots and cornbread before dinner are an amazing touch.  Makes you feel at home with some comfort starters, gratis.

When you are debating about entrees, I will tell you one thing: they all feel like a home cooked meal.  As crazy or global as some of these dishes may look (menu changes by season) you won't be put off by flavors you don't already love.  Chef Hodgson is a real great dude, too.  So stop by and show some love for one of Cleveland's best gems for food fare."}
{"text":"When we stayed in Cleveland, after looking at the Yelp app we realized there are so many restaurants in the downtown Cleveland area. We contemplated hitting up 4th street, however a ton of the restaurants were closed on Sundays and we were in a pinch. We looked up the Hodge's menu and decided to give it a try!

The atmosphere inside is really cool- the reviews are right, the giant red chairs are uber comfy and the corn bread is delicious. For the first time in years, I ordered a burger. It was pretty good! Nothing to write home about, the dill cheese that was served on it was interesting. Their tots are cooked to perfection. 

My only complaint is the happy hour/drink deal. Happy hour is only served at the bar... And since we got a table and no one told us that we kind of missed out. Also- the drinks are VERY expensive. It was 13$ for a traditional margarita in a lowball glass. It was good, don't get me wrong. But I couldn't taste the difference between that an a 6$ one from a Mexican place back home."}
{"text":"Six stars!  We walked across the street to this place from the Holiday Inn Express on Euclid - getting a table for two on a Sunday night was no problem - at least with no NFL, NBA, or MLB games going on.  The usual hipster decor, but comfortable.  Good wine and beer list, attentive service, and a very interesting menu.  Bay of Fundy salmon and pork cutlet were excellent entrees.

The cornbread with maple butter was exceptional - but light enough not to fill you up.  Served in a hot iron skillet.

Cleveland has some very nice things going on.  This restaurant is one of them."}
{"text":"If you're looking for decadent food with layers of flavoring, this is your place!  We were seated upstairs. It was too hot, so they moved us downstairs. Much better air flow. I let them know I had a garlic allergy and they were very accommodating. I had the Chilean sea bass with lobster mashed potatoes. It was so flavorful. My husband got the artichoke and ricotta ravioli, also delicious! He also loved the salad with arugula, couscous, vegetables etcetera. We were full, but they had homemade   Strawberry shortcake. It was an excellent meal, and Fay (Faydra) was so kind and professional. Will definitely add this to our favorite when we return to Cleveland."}
{"text":"A group of nine of us went to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Before we went up to Ohio, my boyfriend and I were tasked with finding somewhere to eat after our trip to the Hall of Fame. My boyfriend and I both decided to each pick five places based on Yelp searches and reviews. Hodge's was on his list. We decided on this place based on reviews, menu items, price range and proximity to the Hall of Fame. If you don't mind a little hike by foot a few blocks, this place wasn't bad to trek to.

We did not have to wait to be sat despite being a group, the fact that it was around five o'clock p.m. on the Friday before Memorial Day and both the Indians and Cavs were playing. In fact, the restaurant never got that busy. 

The menu is apparently the chef's unique spin on comfort food. The cornbread for the table was delicious and sweet, but not too sweet. The mac and cheese is apparently the signature dish. Of our group of nine, one person got it. He didn't seem overly impressed.

For an appetizer we got sweet and sour chicken meatballs which were neither overly sweet nor sour. Very delicious. 

I got the hanger steak cooked medium rare with truffle-whipped potatoes and asparagus. I could not have been more pleased with my meal. The steak was cooked perfectly and practically melted in my mouth and the potatoes were wonderfully flavored. No complaints at all.

I tried my boyfriend's pork cutlet which was also good and breaded perfectly with just the right amount of crunch. 

I am very pleased with this place, though I think it should maybe have three dollar signs rather than two. Having said that, you do get what you pay for, and that's good. 

Speaking of money, the bill comes in a red envelope that has, \"The Damage\" printed on it. We all thought that was very cute."}
{"text":"I made reservations at Hodge's for a pre-Playhouse Square dinner adventure and enjoyed the experience very much.  We arrived a bit late for our reservation but the hostess was kind and there was plenty of room in the dining area. It was a tad chilly so we opted out of the patio although the back doors were open and some folks were seated out there. (Maybe another time, patio!)

Being a little short for time we opted for a couple beers and entrees. I like that they have a decent micro-brew selection including local breweries. The cornbread skillet came out quickly and it was oh so good! In my family, sweet cornbread is king and Hodge's was sweet, moist, and fall-apart perfection with crispy edges and made even better with the maple syrup infused butter. 

For entrees we ordered the hanger steak and Ohio chicken.  I thought both dishes were good - the hanger steak was crisped outside and moist inside and it was offset with roasted asparagus and lovely garlic (heavy, heavy on the garlic!) truffle mashed potatoes that seemed a bit strong (but still delicious) on their own and absolutely heavenly when paired with the steak.

The Ohio chicken was cooked well and perfectly moist, the gnocchi was divine and the brussel sprouts, mushrooms, and carrots great accompaniments but something with the broth was a bit \"off\" to my taste-buds.  It seemed very strong on vinegar which was a bit disappointing since if the vinegar had been dialed back even a tad, I think my palette would have found it much improved. 

All said, we were in and out in an hour - just in time for a pleasant walk back to the theater for our show.  I'll definitely return again!"}
{"text":"My boss and I are in town for work and this was near our hotel. All I can say is that this place is AMAZING! The food, ambiance and service was spectacular! Our server, Stephanie was great! Best service I've had in a while! Highly recommend for a delicious dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Love it! The staff is super friendly and helpful. Definitely will be back. Great atmosphere and the chicken sliders were delicious."}
{"text":"This place was pretty spectacular. I like the classy yet Motown kind of feel first of all, the friendly helpful staff second of all, and the food most of all.  I am hesitant to give 5 stars as I got the special and I don't know how their normal menu is, but the foie gras torchon appetizer was one of the best things I've put in my mouth. 

The goose liver came out cold and creamy as a perfect rich butter substitute for a maple infused crunchy warm French toast slice of equal size to the foie gras. It was the texture of warm butter, but richer and more exotic. Delish.  For an entree the steak I had was perfectly cooked, and the sweet potato tots on the side were the essence of the classy yet down to earth environment this place is all about. Tots must be eaten with your hands, but they were sophisticated in the freshness, sweet potato mixup, and house sauce with a touch of cinnamon.

I'm going back in the next two weeks to find out if their regular menu is as good. Here is hoping!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Sunday late afternoon and had yummy drinks (the Moscow Mule rocks!) as well as some seriously good food!  The crab hushpuppy appetizer was very tasty and both the pork osso bucco and the hanger steak were very well prepared. The cast iron cornbread was wonderful!  Service was super. Will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Great drinks! I love the simple menu too everything sounds great but it's not overwhelming to read! The service was good and parking was easy"}
{"text":"Straight up my salmon ceaser salad had SUGAR on the croutons. This ain't no Cinnabon like that's gross plz stop. Also had two massive chunks of parm like they got to the end of shredding the block and threw in the waxy ass. Yeah I came in at the end of the night but that's nasty. I would give u 2 stars but I'm hoping I caught u on a bad night ew"}
{"text":"I was eating alone, I bellied up to the bar and was promptly served my beer.  I had time to look over the menu and I read such wonderful things about the cornbread I ordered that, along with a burger.  The cornbread was over rated, the burger was amazing.  Otherwise a great location and good food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and delicious menu. Steven G provided excellent service and didn't steer us wrong w menu selections."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in CLE. We went for drinks and dinner before a show, ended up completely blown away by the food and service. 
The shrimp and grits was perfect, the risotto and scallops was delectable."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Got the chicken and dumpling soup and stuffed peppers as an app. Chicken and dumpling soup just tasted like straight salt and the stuffed peppers were tiny with hardly any taste."}
{"text":"The food was not worth my money. I really did not like my dish. The chicken was over cooked. I order fried chicken and I wasn't impressed. However, the wine was tasty and the server was nice."}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences at Hodge's. My first time, I had a great meal and great service. However, I'm starting to think that was because it was a weekday and not super packed.
My next experience was on a Friday evening and I wasn't impressed with any of it. It wasn't bad but wasn't anything spectacular either. Additionally for what you're getting I didn't necessarily think it was worth the price. 

If friends wanted to go back to this place, I'd join them but probably keep my eating to a minimum."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dinner here. The cornbread came out in a cast iron skillet and was still warm. I ate the entire thing myself and thoroughly enjoyed it. As my main meal I got the large chopped salad with Bay of Fundi salmon on top with a side of brussels sprouts. The staff was very friendly and though the restaurant decor wasn't especially exciting, the food more than made up for it. 

I went on a Thursday night around 8 pm and had no trouble getting a table, so reservations are most likely not needed!"}
{"text":"The cornbread is amazing. The food and service were great. It seemed to have a local flair. It has a great location, close to stadiums and the casino."}
{"text":"Dropped in last night to grab a drink or two and some grub before going to a concert at the HOB. Things seem to have changed since my last visit. 

My beloved Moscow Mule was still on the menu. And I still got a piping hot skillet of sugary sweet cornbread with my meal, but...my food was a little underwhelming. Or actually overwhelming, because it was hella salty. I'm a girl who puts salt on everything and could eat cubes of salt if they were available, but...this was a little too much for me.

Since it was happy hour, we got some of the signature tots for $5. They came with three dipping sauces - ketchup, honey mustard, and something else that was ranchy or onion-y. Although the menu promised sweet potato tots, we got regular ones. That was kind of a bummer.

For my meal, I got the 6 veg plate. Hello, salty veggies! Gone were the best Brussels sprouts I'd ever eaten (which I got on the veg plate last time) and they were replaced with green beans. Siiigh. It was a super salty plate of veggies that I'm not even going to bother describing. It was that underwhelming.

My boyfriend's mushroom gnocchi, though? THAT was some good stuff. I really wish I'd gotten that because it was cheaper and tastier!

We happened to be eating at the bar and could sense there was some tension among the staff. It was also kind of funny to me that servers kept coming behind the bar to chug red bull. Maybe we caught them on an off night, but no one seemed overly enthused to be working there. Weep womp.

I'm not giving up on Hodge's! Despite my salty meal and slightly salty service, I will go back! Maybe once it's nicer out and I can sit on the patio..."}
{"text":"I would come back here just for the cornbread.

Nice and warm in your own personal skillet, crispy on the edges, soft in the center, with a tinge of sweetness and a huge helping of deliciousness.  Probably the best complimentary bread I've ever had in any restaurant.  Oh gosh, just writing about it is making me crave it.

Also, the tater tots - crisp and salted perfectly - very addictive.

We came for lunch, during which the menu is more reminiscent of the fare they serve on the trucks - mac 'n cheese, honey ribs, sandwiches and such.  I had the PBLT, which was HUGE and dripping with juice.  The pulled pork was a tad too spicy on its own but worked well as part of a sandwich.  The bacon didn't add too much to the flavor, though I guess it contributed to the dripping.  My girlfriend had the honey ribs, and she felt that the sauce tasted a bit confusing to her, though she liked it overall.

We were on the second floor of the restaurant, and we felt a little bad for the one waitress taking care of the seven tables or so up there.  The service was sluggish, but who can you really blame if the one waitress is hurrying up and down and up and down that flight of stairs trying to keep up with the lunchtime rush.  Props to her.

Anyways.  Go here and eat the cornbread.  And then bring some back for me."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here after seeing the new public square. It had a good reviews and seem to have a casual atmosphere so we gave it a try. This place is awesome! Our server was great! Very attentive and helpful. Our water glasses were always full, which is great on a hot summer day. 

The complimentary cornbread was delicious and so was my burger. One of the best burgers I ever had and the tatertots were yummy too. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place 3 stars... but I liked the wait staff and the atmosphere so I decided to bump it up a notch.

Came in here with a group from work. There were 7 of us and we all enjoyed our meals - although no one said their food was outstanding. I had the \"lunch box\" which included their PBLT - always delicious and very similar to their food truck. I will say the pulled pork was a bit dry in it - but no worries I just dipped a bit into the corn bisque, which was REALLY good! The lunch box also came with a minuscule salad. The salad was really good too... I just wish there was more of it. 

Their is a smoky flavor to just about everything, it seems. We sat inside in a back room (the place was packed) but no one was outside, which looks like a super cool place to spend the happy hour after work. Great outdoor bar area, of which there are very few (if any?) in downtown CLE. 

I'd go again. Appertizers and beers on the patio for me next time!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give 1.5 but that's not allowed, so I am giving Hodge's the benefit of the doubt.

We had a reservation for 730, having not been able to get anything earlier, even on a Sunday.  Turns out with Neil Diamond in town, it was a hopping joint.  Couldn't tell when we walked in though - the place was slow and emptying fast.  Was all the food gone?  Umm...

After a moment to check if an empty table was set up, we were sat by a lovely hostess who made some recommendations that were consistent with others we had read - lobster corn dogs (more on that later), mac and cheese and the french onion ravioli.  It's nice that she had an opinion to share - because our waiter sure didnt.  When we asked what we should try - it was like a blank look.  Nothing.  No recommendation.  Kind of sad.

The aforementioned tater tots (pleasantly crispy, yummy sour creamy sauce) arrived, as well as the cornbread with maple bourbon butter.  Not so impressed by the cornbread...just didnt taste great.  It wasn't fluffy - just corny.

We got the lobster corn dog (aka the Big Dipper) appetizer.  Meh.  Ew.  I dont know...just wasnt really feeling the mushed up lobster.  Maybe it's my Boston roots, but that was a waste of perfectly good seafood.  #fail 1.

I had the burger...good.  Greasy/juicy, decent flavor.  A little past medium, but good flavor.  Not sure I'd order again, becase the bibb lettuce it had was a miss...I would use something spicier, like arugula...but I'm a Father's Office (LA) fan.  And again, pleasantly crispy tater tots.  Prob a 3.5.

Mom ordered the wedge salad...which looked like it may have been the last wedge of the night.  The iceberg was rusty.  Perhaps the remnants of the Neil Diamond fans?  #fail 2.

Dad had the duck.  The side dishes were UNREAL, and by far the best thing any of us ate.  A pearl barley risotto with roasted brussel sprouts and golden raisins.  if I ever had to eat at Hodge's again, I'd ask for that.  With no meat.  The duck...meh.  The fatty skin hadn't been rendered AT ALL and was thus inedible.  Dad had to cut it off.  The meat was done well, pink in the middle, juicy and tasty.  But that damn skin, which should be so good...well.... #fail 3.

Then the piece de resistence. We ordered the seasonal (peach rhubarb crisp).  It came out ICE COLD...like refrigerator cold.  With not a bit of goldenness to the topping.  I asked the waiter if that's intentional and he took it back to the kitchen to have them fire it again.  And so it returned.  Soft ice cream (hadn't been refrozen) on the side.  And still cool in the middle, still no golden topping, bubbling at the edges a la microwave oven.  So we sent it back yet again, and had it taken off the bill, to which the manager added my beer.  #fail 4

Add to all of this add the cute little gnats and fruit flies that appear to plague Cleveland restaurants with their summer open doors... #fail 5.

So...all in all.  Meh.  Maybe.  The only reason for 2 stars...the manager came over and apologized.  Too little too late, but salvaged a star. :)"}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight - a Tuesday night. I'm here by myself for a conference. I started with some Hodge Punch, which was a perfect summer cool down drink. The cornbread is out of this world. I got the CAB burger and tater tots - perfectly cooked and seasoned. All around great meal - thanks!!"}
{"text":"We originally planned to go here for lunch after the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a bit of a joke, as my bf's last name is Hodges. Little did we know it would be great!
We both ordered the \"lunchbox\", which is a choice of half sandwich, plus a small salad and cup of soup, both of which were the daily special/ chef's choice. The only real snafu happened here- our waiter told us the soup was beer cheese, and it was most definitely not. It was, to my guess, a smooth gazpacho. It was great, but not what we were expecting, and my bf was disappointed. The salad was unique- mixed greens with feta, mango, and a few other things, dressed with champagne vinigarette. Yum. I chose the chicken salad, which was good, if a bit standard. The price was right and it was a fun lunch choice.
The ambiance and environment was very cool! We went when it was very slow, but it was nice to have the quiet. The place is big but not overwhelming- there are two separate bars plus a large patio with its own bar. The decor was cute and classy. I enjoyed it and would definitely go again, not even just for the same-name photo op!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit Hodge's for over a year now! Sadly I was disappointed by both the service and the food. I was so excited that they had vegetarian and vegan options. Unfortunately the potstickers that I ordered were fried? They tasted like charcoal. I couldn't taste anything except for the fact that they were overdone. Also the other person at my table ordered deviled eggs. They were sour and he was hesitant to continue eating them. The table next to us also didn't like their eggs.... When my meal came the entree was bigger than expected. About 1/4 into my meal I could not eat another bite.  On top of that we had an uneaten side salad that was as big as an entree. The waiter took away my food (commented that people often can not finish)and I did not have the option to take it home. Our total bill for two people was over $100. Maybe it's not classy to take home leftovers, but I should have been given that option. I feel like we threw our money away!!! On top of it all there were fruit flies everywhere, even landing in my food. Plus they were playing Christmas music on Valentine's weekend! I wanted to love it but instead I won't be going back.:("}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The staff is awesome, place is always clean, fluffy people friendly seating, and price is great as well. I've been here twice. The first time I came I had the crispy chicken sandwich. It was great. The chicken was juicy, and Hodges hot sauce is great. Jalapeño coleslaw... 100%! Tatertots instead of fries!! So good!! The 2nd time I came was with a group of people from work. We had an hour for lunch. We were back at work in that hour. Our waitress Liz was fantastic. She didn't mess up any orders or receipts or cards! She was on the ball. I had the Cesar salad with chicken. Omg.... this thing was huge! I didn't even finish it all because it was so big. The check was fantastic. The croutons were like thin slices and there were huge thin slices of cheese. There were sun dried tomatoes in there for a nice added touch. The dressing was just the right amount and the lettuce didn't get soggy. I was craving this salad all week since having it. The price was totally worth it because the amount I got. Huge!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating away from the bustle of east 4th but just around the corner."}
{"text":"Stopped here to celebrate valentine's day a few days late. Happened to be a Tuesday where they had half price wine. Boyfriend and I decided to order a bunch of appetizers. 

Deviled eggs are a must have. So yummy.
Cornbread was amazing, perfect dessert! 
Blue crab hush puppies were delicious, big fan! 
Finally, the animal tots were crazy good! Highly recommend. 
Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Went in and ordered lunch today with a friend: The Shrimp & Grits, Lunch Combo(tomato bisque, grilled cheese on ciabata with cesar salad) , The Crunchy Chicken Sandwich & the Cornbread. All were delicious. I'm impressed for our first time visiting & will definitely return. Alysia was our server and she was real chill & helpful!"}
{"text":"Having watched the rise and fall of the very mediocre Zinc, which occupied this space previously, I was so pleased to see Hodge's sign go up. I've long been a fan of his food truck fare, and I had high hopes that he could translate that into his brick-and-mortar venture. I went for lunch with a sizeable group- two tables of 6 of us- and we tried a good portion of the menu. The \"lunchbox\" was quite popular; you can choose from the PBLT, turkey club, or grilled cheese half sandwich, and that is accompanied by a soup and your choice of three salads. Not a bad deal at $11.50. Today's soup was a spring pea bisque, and it was fabulous. However, I am going to ding them for not having the asparagus soup, which is a permanent menu item. Also on our table were the burger and the mac & cheese, both of which were roundly praised. Someone else next door- the pickiest guy I know- had the ribs and loved them. In short, the food exceeded expectations. There was clearly a lot of thought put into the menu. Service was a little slow, but we were a large group, and this was their third lunch service, so I'll chalk it up to newness. I'm looking forward to coming back for dinner and happy hours on the fabulous patio, and making this a regular haunt."}
{"text":"Came here before a show in Playhouse Square a few months back. From the reviews ive read im guessing we came on an off night. But for what we paid we left disappointed. I had the pork cutlet which was cooked a little too much and my fiance had the mac and cheese which was very bland for the cheese that was in it. priceing was what you expect downtown. the food was not"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the food at Hodge's. I went to Hodges's for the first time on a Tuesday and got the 2 for $40 deal which came with two entrees, a bottle of wine, and an appetizer to share. This was an amazing value and both entrees were really great! We got the tortellini alfredo and the shrimp and grits and I highly suggest both of those dishes. We got the crab hush puppies for an appetizer which were pretty good but nothing exceptional. Overall this is a great restaurant in downtown Cleveland with friendly service, quality food, and good prices."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot walking distance from the downtown hotels."}
{"text":"It only gets 2 stars for service and display. The food was not great and over seasoned"}
{"text":"I found my way here during the Polar Vortex of January 2014. Part of me only stopped here to stop from a slow miserable death outside, but the rest of me is glad I decided to go here. The food was good, and the bartender was extremely nice. I would go here again, Polar Vortex or not anytime."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials if you sit at the bar! All day (4-9pm) on Sundays and from 4-6 and after 9pm on weekdays. We came in on a Sunday and sat at the bar inside because it was melting outside - but the outdoor patio area looked nice. Their C.A.B. Burger ($6) is crazy delicious and comes with tater tots and House aioli. Not a healthy burger by any means but it was so satisfying (drool). The tater tots were surprisingly really good too!

Also got a Great Lakes beer on draft for $3 and a tasty gin and tonic for $6. I'll have to come back soon and try all the other options on the HH menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, drinks, service.   Went before and after cavaliers game.  Got a little crowded pregame but wasn't overly crowded after. 

Valet parking is nice but we were staying hotel next door (Marriott) so only friends used. 

I didn't find one bad thing in the menu.  The small plate appetizers were all good and we had about all of them. 

I had the scallops and it was terrific. 

Can't say enough good things about this place.  Looks like would be fun In summer when outside patio and bar is open.  

I'm not from Cleveland so don't know a lot about the chef but he supposedly won food network food truck competition and competed late into food network starts competition.  I'm sure others from Cleveland can tell you more."}
{"text":"Delicious food, awful martini, okay service. We went here for dinner while visiting Cleveland for Cowboys game and my fiance's birthday. We had the crab flatbread - so flavorful, light, and perfectly crispy - and deviled eggs - sooo good but sooo salty - for appetizers. He ordered a dirty martini and thought it came back with vermouth so sent it back (first time I've ever seen him send something back, seriously!) but the second one was equally as bad. Our waitress seemed new and nervous but was nice. Fiancé had crispy chicken sandwich but with grilled chicken and he LOVED IT. I had burger and also loved it. Also, restaurant had a cool vibe - upscale bar but not stuffy."}
{"text":"We like coming here to grab a drink or two....or three...well, likely just two. They can be a bit on the pricey side if I am being honest. Likely why its never all that busy except for happy hour. That said, the service is always really great. Bartenders really know their stuff, make good recommendations, ect. The food is also very good. We have only delved into small plates and apps so far (during those happy hours)."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I had lunch here today and the food was really bad. I had the pork cutlet and he the crispy chicken sandwich. I was in a hurry or I would have sent mine back because the bun was like a rock, it felt like it had been sitting uncovered for a day or three. The pork was greasy and lacked flavor as well. His chicken sandwich looked odd and he said it tasted \"off' as well. The tater tots were good as was the service but the food was really poor."}
{"text":"Decent service, but horrible food. The best way to describe what my party ate was \"cruise\" food, but worse. Would not suggest it."}
{"text":"Had the spicy chicken sandwich and the jerk chicken nachos!! Delicious! Fast, friendly service! New favorite restaurant...for the price point, you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"What a super cute place! Very festive decorations for the holidays with enjoyable, but not annoying, holiday music.  I was in town for work eating solo, so I ate in the bar area. The bar tender provided excellent service. I ordered the Caesar salad with salmon, tomato bisque, and tater tots. The salad was great - not too much dressing - but a little heavy handed on the sundries tomatoes. The salmon was cooked well but needed a tad more seasoning. The croutons were amazing. I want a bag of them to eat as chips! The tomato bisque was the best I can recall ever having. The tater tots were just normal but the house aioli was a little spicy and a nice pairing. I'm not in Cleveland often, but I would definitely return here!"}
{"text":"So I'm practically a Mac & Cheese expert and the Mac & Cheese I ate here was some of the most interesting and inspired that I've ever encountered. There was a slight sweetness thanks to dates, mascarpone, and goat cheese... counterbalanced by a little kick from poblano pepper. It's everything I love in life on one plate and it was absolutely delicioso!  

I visited for lunch, so thankfully I was able to take advantage of the less expensive lunch pricing. Dinner Mac & Cheese will set you back $18 (and an additional $5 if you want to add duck). The lunch portion is $12.50. 

Service was excellent. The staff was attentive and everyone we encountered was very nice. I love the decor and the seating was extremely comfortable. 

Only issue was a minor fruit fly problem. There were three circling our table and we were getting dive-bombed by the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Wow, what a letdown. I'd have given 2-1/2 stars, but the excellent service deserves positive recognition. 

Now to the food...The warm cornbread was overly dense, buttery and sweet, like a cornmeal shortbread cookie.  We ordered the pork cutlet, shrimp and grits, and several draft beers.  The pork cutlet had a well-seasoned crust, but the cutlet was thinner than the crust.  And the cutler was so tough and dry that we had difficulty cutting it.  The shrimp and grits were ok.  The grits and the blanc sauce had good texture but had mild flavor, and the dish didn't justify the $25 cost.  The final affront was $8.50 for each draft of the locally brewed GLB beer."}
{"text":"Tried Hodge's tonight during a visit to Cleveland. We were excited to try it after reading the excellent reviews, but did not have as great as an experience. The food was delicious - Swedish meatballs, potstickers, and the CAB burger with bacon were all fantastic. However, with the prices and small portions, the service and atmosphere need to be superb and they were not. Upon arrival, we waited longer than expected without anyone to greet us. When we were finally helped, it was directly next to (and I mean shoulder-to-shoulder) the only other table in the area at the time. I get how sections work for servers, and they should be in the same area for efficiency, but the closeness was awkward and uncomfortable. The booth was ripped and dirty. Saw our server 3x - once to get our drink orders (3 soft drinks should not take 7 minutes to come out), once to get our food order, and once at the end of the meal to drop off our check. We actually had to ask a nearby bus boy to remove our dirty plates when our server made no attempt to. Our server also never explained desserts to us, even though she gave great suggestions to the table next to us without being prompted. Not sure if they still do the complimentary cornbread, but we weren't offered that either. In conclusion, the food tastes great but I would rather spend my money at a restaurant with staff who put in time and effort to ensure a great experience."}
{"text":"I honestly feel stupid coming here with Lola just around the corner.  Ingredients were fresh, but the combinations chosen were awful.  Crab hush puppies, lackluster, $12.  Scallops had a heavy cheesy risotto with them that totally smothered their flavor.  People were nice and all, but with Lola around the corner, I know I won't be back."}
{"text":"What a fantastic, overall experience! We came out for a nice dinner and made reservations expecting a bustling evening. But when we arrived, empty. The wait staff and greeters were on the ball and were friendly the whole evening. From spot on drink recommendations to help with the dinner choices, the staff knows what they are talking about. 

On to the food... Very hard to narrow down the tight choice because it all looks great! The mac and cheese was fantastic, the pork cutlet was superb, but the star of the night was the burger and the service that comes with it. I ordered a medium rare burger and the first one that came out was dry and more on the medium well side. Both the waitress and the manager both came to our table yo ask if they can make another. I can tell you that both were very persistent, haha. After offering multiple things off my bill, I broke down and ordered a remake. PERFECT! 

The drinks were delicious, the food to die for, and the service exceptional. I will be back and so should you!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Hodges twice and my experience was solid both times.  What's not to like with Americana style comfort foods?

Visit 1: before a Cavs playoff game.  Not as crowded as East 4th restaurants, nice combo meal option of 2/$40 with soup, bottle of wine and 2 entrees.  Waitress was super nice, fun and friendly.

Visit 2: ate outside, group of 6.  A nice ambiance, not super beautiful since you clearly see Euclid Ave and the parking garage entrance, but they tried to make it nice.  Very spacious.  Everyone was happy with the appetizers and entrees - both the variety in selection and taste.  

Food is solid and consistent in quality, but not amazing.  Slightly high priced but that's what you get for the location, reasonable and competitive with the area.

Bathrooms: a bit hard to find but incredibly well appointed and clean."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment! My husband and I are huge fans of both trucks (Hodge Podge and D&DS) so we were really looking forward to trying Hodges. Finally made it in one Tuesday night last month and really were not impressed overall. 

Service: A-ok

Atmosphere: strange for me. Lounge-y seating and lighting but with barn wood walls? But let's judge the restaurant by the food, shall we?

The food: Turned out to be a prix fixe menu night (app, 2 entrees, and bottle of wine for 40 bucks). We elected to go with this option and selected the 'pickle jar' for the appetizer. I won't comment on the wine as it was fine, and you can't expect anything amazing when it comes included. The pickle jar was ok. My grandma makes pickled veggies too. Not bad, but nothing special. 

The mains were decent. I would say average for the price. If not for the dessert, this would be a 3-star review.

Even now, I just cannot believe what was served us as 'peach crisp' for dessert. The operative word here is 'crisp'. We got some warm fruit with some sugary floury topping sprinkled on top. There was nothing crisp about it. I actually laughed when I saw it.

Now,  I'm not trying to pick on the new kid in town here, people. We were really pulling for this place.  I'm sorry but when I go to a highly-billed restaurant with a well-respected owner, is it too much to ask for the crisp to be crispy? Honeslty, forget the chef and owner, I'd be embarrassed as a server to bring that to somebody! Unbelievable.

We REALLY wanted to love this place but man, it  just was not a great experience. Can't say we'll be back anytime soon, but I could see having a couple drinks on that awesome patio. But remember, the sweet patio wasn't enough to keep Zinc going when all was said and done."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. We had the hanger steak and the shrimp and grits and ate the whole thing. Each of us mind you, but I would have made a valiant effort. Atmosphere was perfect and the staff was attentive. It was a perfect dinner before a hockey game."}
{"text":"The food is incredible, the wait staff is attentive but not smothering, and if you go on a Tuesday night there is a (fairly generous) prix fixe menu featuring a shared appetizer, two entrees, and a bottle of wine all for $40. 

The first time we went, my boyfriend got some sort of steak (which he raved about) and I got the 6 veg. Both excellent. The second time he ordered the fish and chips and I got the salmon and lobster mashed potatoes. Even better! It would be a fantastic meal any time, but Tuesday is just an incredible deal! I recommend it whenever I get a chance."}
{"text":"Great hamburger and salmon, clean place, very peaceful and the service was nice and warm."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! I went to Hodge's with the Cleveland Supper Club. It was a six course meal! amazing! I am still thinking about the arugula/cherry/sweet cornbread crouton salad and the corn crème brulee days later. The only disappointing dish was the smoked tofu, there was not a lot favor. Go, enjoy the food!!"}
{"text":"Modern twists on old classics. Loved the free appetizer sampler and fantastic cornbread. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. 

Service was impeccable and the atmosphere was clean and modern.

Loved the quirky \"The Damage\" envelope that the bill came in too, nice touch.

Wasn't too busy when we were there, but if our experience is the norm, I'd expect this place to be packed soon."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check out Hodge's for a long time now and just never got around to it. But I'm so glad I finally did! We went to last night for happy hour before The Price is Right Live at Palace Theater, it was the perfect walking distance.

They have wine and beer specials along with $2 off all appetizers. I was surprised by the atmosphere, I thought the inside would be much bigger. It was a very long thin restaurant, but with a cool ambiance.

We tried the calamari and chicken wings, and I know that these are hard to mess up but they were both great. The chicken wings were probably some of the best I have EVER had and the calamari wasn't soggy despite all of the garnish with it (which is a big no-no to me). So all in all, Hodge's passed the test.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre restaurant featuring traditional American food. Seafood salad is the healthiest dish I can find on the menu."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food but the service slacked some. First we were seated without a drink list then it took half hour to get our drinks. Our appetizers were even served before our drinks. We were told that the bar was slammed but there was barely anyone in there. We were only checked on once and it took a while to get the checj. The food overall was great. The cornbread is amazing!! We devoured it within seconds."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here, it's not remarkable either way... The patio is cool when the weather is nice and they have music from time-to-time, but it's not anything special, and if you're visiting the area, and have limited time, pass on this one for another great local gem."}
{"text":"Excellent food and on Tuesdays the have a dinner for two with app and bottle of wine for $40 you can't beat it.  Don't fall for their Parking when my wife and I left we found out it was $30 to park yes $30 so much for that great deal..."}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown, open late on Sundays, with two levels of seating. Happy hour is at the bar only, but the prices are still reasonable when not happy hour too. We hit here for dinner on Sunday night. The football game had let out a couple hours earlier and drunk fans were still scattered about but thankfully, management had their eyes peeled and were on the ball for any rowdiness. Fun to watch from the second floor though. 

We order two of the daily specials and shared a dessert. Food was good but not memorable. Hit the spot of a good meal before turning in for the night. Staff was attentive. The decor was great. Very fun atmosphere that is good for two or to meet a group of people. The noise level can get up there, but not too bad. Best part was the cornbread and sweet butter that is brought to your table. Really dense, moist and filling, so be careful, or you won't be able to eat your food. That happened to me. 

I can't speak to parking, as we valeted at the hotel, but worth the trek to find this place, I think. Especially for happy hour, if you can find a seat in the bar."}
{"text":"I'd rather give this place a 4.5 of 5 but I'll explain. 

We went Monday evening, and they advertized their \"happy hour\", starting at 6PM, which was a decent deal. They also had their house burger half off, so I couldn't resist such a deal myself. Our servers were pleasant and upbeat, and we had a lovely taller lady with great black eyeliner and dark hair, she was courteous to our table of 4 and was there to refresh beverages and be of assistance.

The restaurant is SUPER cute, somewhat dimly lit but I can see how this place thrives on the big crowd Cleveland culture. We tried lots of different menu options amongst our party: appetizers including deviled eggs, chorizo sausage wrapped with bacon, and this SUPERB pizza with a savory jam on top with duck and goat cheese (this was my favorite & you MUST order!) We also got two burger plates that come with \"animal tots\" which were delicious and these would be the other item you must try from their menu. My friend ordered the peanut butter port house beer with a shot of vanilla vodka and said he loved it.

As for dessert, we all shared three different skillets which were a lemon tart, a chocolate-chip cookie sundae, and an apple pie topped with salted caramel soft serve. The lemon tart was much too bitter and too runny, in my opinion. The apple pie was more or less a crumble with ice cream on top and the salted caramel was very good. The chocolatecookie sundae was something I could've made myself at home. So thus my 4 stars instead of 5. The desserts are a huge letdown and not very large at all. 

Otherwise, we greatly enjoyed our supper here.

{"text":"I was very disappointed in both the quality and quantity of food for the price. I ordered the large Cesar salad which was $13 and added grilled chicken for an additional $5. The large was what I would consider a regular sized salad and there was about 4 small strips of chicken on top. There was very little dressing and a couple small croutons. I worked four years at a Country Club and I know what nice dinner salads should look like. For $18 I would have expected much more lettuce and more dressing with a generous amount of homemade croutons and a lot more chicken. My partner got a cheeseburger medium well and the center part of the burger (about half of the meat) was still red. The server also did not write down the Order and forgot to remove onions and got our side completely wrong. When my partner did not eat the red part of his burger, the server then decided to lecture him on his misconceptions about not eating the red part of the burger. Our meal costs us $35 and I was pained to have to give our rude and flawed server at least a $5 tip for the basic service. The only redeeming part of the meal was the \"complementary\" corn bread. After paying almost $40 for our disappointing meal And negative service I feel like that cornbread was everything but complementary."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place based off the reviews but we were very displeased with the service and food. The food was overpriced and subpar. The shrimp and grits was delicious, don't get me wrong, but the rest of our party's meals were not. This place should not have 4 stars. Not to mention our server was trying to be sarcastic but it came off as rude. Not a nice way to start our night in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner before a show and I am so glad we did.  Started with the crab hushpuppies and deviled eggs.  I swear those hushpuppies are probably the best I have ever had - they are crisp on the outside, moist on the inside, tons of flavor.  Deviled eggs were also great.  Then the server brought out the FREE cornbread and maple butter - delicious and not just because it was free.  I was already full, but had already ordered my entree - the braised beef and mashed potatoes.  Those potatoes were so creamy and the meat just melted in my mouth.  Seriously good food - great location.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My colleague and I were looking for something downtown before a meeting. We tried this at an off time, and the restaurant wasn't busy. That always worries me, because I think most restaraunts are better when they are busy.  I have to say, this was delicious. I had the salmon with couscous and pickled vegetables. I would go back today and have that again, and there are so many other things I want to try as well.

 I highly recommend Hodge's, don't miss this restuarant."}
{"text":"What else can I say about how amazing the food and the staff are at Hodges.  I've never had a disappointing experience here and each time I'm surprised at the consistency of my meal.  
Our meal started with fantastic drinks made by Jeff, whom I absolutely love!!  A perfectly made Dark and Stormy and some Hendricks on the rocks.   Delish!!  We ordered the mussels as an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised when the chef brought out a dish of tater tots with a delicious dipping sauce on the side.  My main dish was the salmon and OMG was it to die for.  Paired accordingly with brussel sprouts and a garlic sauce I could have easily licked the dish clean.  
Attentive service and detail to each part of my meal made this Hodges experience another one for the books :)"}
{"text":"I have always liked Hodge's and recently visited. With the holidays, all lunch locations are packed as was Hodge's. I was slightly disappointed that they didn't have the upstairs open though as people could have been seated more quickly. I recently started to have disarray restrictions and asked the server for some recommendations of what I could order that was low fat. I asked about their salads, dressings, etc. and he seemed somewhat clueless. After speaking to the restaurant's expediter, he came back and informed me that they would do the shrimp and grits with shrimp, plain grits and asparagus and that it would be low fat. I asked that they use as little butter/oil as possible. When the entree came out, I had 6 shrimp and 6 asparagus and an otherwise naked plate except for a lot of butter/oil. Everything tasted great, but I was hoping for just a little more substance and a little less oil."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat lunch on a warm, sunny day. The food was absolutely outstanding and the service was right on target. Usually, when I go to a restaurant, I can expect one or two things that I wish I could change, but honestly my meal was flawless. Everything was cooked perfectly, the bartender was attentive and friendly and the atmosphere was casual and relaxing. This is by far the gem I wanted it to be. It makes me excited for all of the other new restaurants I'll be trying now that I'm back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious lunch! 

Talk about a popular patio for lunch! The patio looked very clean, cozy and every table was taken. We decided to sit inside to see the decor. I was definitely impressed the decor, I love the big red leather chairs.

Our server was great, she greeted us right away and got our waters quickly. Once our glasses were empty, it did take her a few minutes to get to us but it was pretty busy so we couldn't fault her for it. 

I love their Lunchbox idea, you get a little bit of everything. I ordered the tomato soup (delicious), the root stock salad (different but great) and half of the grilled cheese (I am still daydreaming about it). Once I was done eating, all of the plates were empty. Clearly that's a safe indication that the food was delicious. 

All in all, I would definitely return for lunch. I would also like to try the 2 for $40 on Tuesdays and the Happy Hour! Keep up the great work Hodge's!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were really craving burgers so we decided to try the ones here. We were not disappointed. But what really sticks out in my memory is the cornbread. We had ordered some for the table because it was listed under \"sides\" on the menu. We didn't realize it was complimentary until we got the bill! So good. Sweet, salty, buttery perfection. We also got a side of grits. Also delicious. The burgers themselves were good. The brioche bun was a nice touch. There wasn't anything too special about them though. The tater tots were served with a delicious sriracha ailoli. Divine. It seemed like the sides were the favorite part of my experience. They have a wonderful deal on Tuesdays for 2: app, bottle of wine, and 2 entrees for $40! I'm definitely going to come back and try some of the other options on the menu!"}
{"text":"My Mom was in Cleveland for a conference and wanted to meet up for dinner. I wanted to do some exploring downtown, so I grabbed a few names with good reviews and we started walking around. We ran into Hodge's first and it's definitely a good looking place to be. It's right by Playhouse Square, and the outdoor sitting takes up space where an entire building would be. It's great to sit outside on the patio with a few drinks and a meal. I didn't go inside except to go to the restroom, but the place looks nice and classy.

They bring out cornbread for an appetizer and it is one of the most wonderful things at this place. It comes with some real tasty butter and we couldn't stop eating! Barely realized we finished the whole pan. I just really like that they do something a little different. The meals were good, but it's been a while so I can't remember exactly what I had. 

The check comes in a cute little red envelope with \"The Damage\" on it. Clever... I picked up the check and damn near made my Mom cry by paying for dinner. It was well worth the cost of the meal to see her reaction. I would say come here for summertime dinner and drinks for the best experience. I know I'll be back. I could see it being a great date night."}
{"text":"We were really hungry and not familiar with the area and found Hodge's.  What luck.

There is a lovely outdoor seating area and two rooms indoors.  We were warmly welcomed, quickly waited on, and had our food in short order.  I LOVED that our entrees came with tater tots and NOT french fries.  We split a burger and the turkey club and I can't honestly say one was any better than the other ~ they were both delicious and generous in size.  Perfect for 2 very hungry out-of-towners.

Our server was very friendly and recommended some local places we might enjoy on our first visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"The service was really good but the salads are over priced for the quality. $17 for a chicken Caesar salad is a joke. The lettuce alone is 13 and it's 4 bucks to add chicken. My boyfriend got a burger and tots and that was cheaper. I nibbled on some of his tots and they were good."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while in CLE for work. The Dunk Confit Tacos were delicious. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here based off of the great yelp reviews, we were pretty disappointed with the food.  My wife got the steak and it was chewy and had no taste, I ordered the shrimp po boy, which was soggy and I got the tater tots that everyone raved about, they were no better than the frozen ones I buy for my kids.  The service was fair for as slow as they were.  We were not impressed, also a very limited menu"}
{"text":"4 stars based on their Tuesday $40 deal - One bottle of wine, one appetizer and 2 entrees. AND IT WASN'T BUSY! We were pleased with dinner.

I came here for Sunday dinner with friends, sat outside... service wasn't great, seemed a little disorganized, and food took a while... to the point where we had to complain to a manager... did he do anything? NO! but the food was good when we eventually were served

Another peeve: cocktails are a little too pricey... this is CLE! And last time I checked they weren't serving velvet tango room caliber

Advice: Go for the Tuesday $40 dinner deal, happy hour and beer!"}
{"text":"Hodge's is good. And cool. And good.

I've never tried the Dim and Den Sum truck (although I've heard plenty about it). I haven't even tried the Hodge Podge Truck (dang it, I wish they came to the Clinic). But after watching the Great Food Truck race and cheering this Clevelander on, and then finding out he opened a RESTAURANT....why of course, I wanted to try it!

We wandered in at about 5:30pm on Friday, and the place was pretty full. I had liked the layout of Zinc, so I knew I had already liked the atmosphere of the restaurant! They made it a lot more warmer feeling? than Zinc, so it's definitely a cool vibe when you entered in.

Unfortunately, we didn't have a reservation, but we were able to find seats near the bar, where they gave us full service. As we were trying to order, they seemed to be out of quite a few stuff- two of the beers he wanted to try, the mussels, and the beef carpaccio. Huh? On a Friday night? I felt like a little kid denied his cookies. Sad! The waitress explained that they had just changed their menu.. so ok, I let it slide, and gave it a chance. 

On the meantime, we ordered...and then, compliments of the chef, we got tater tots! And man, they were good. Really good. Super crispy, flavorful, with some type of a aioli sauce... he couldn't stop raving how good it was. haha. And then, we got cornbread too! What! I quickly forgot they were out of items. haha. That butter on the cornbread (the maple bourbon?), whatever it was, it was good. Mmm. 

On to what we actually ordered:
- Alps to Amsterdam: I'm a huge fan of St. Germaine, so when I saw there was elderflower liqueur in it, I said, hey, why not? Great mix- elderflower liquer, silver gin, lemon, and club soda. Not heavy at all..and quite refreshing.

- Boiled peanuts: It tasted super peanut-buttery. It was boiled peanuts.. with some type of spice on it. I'm not sure if ti's really \"Korean spiced\", but nonetheless, it was good. A little messy, as it comes in a jar full of what it was boiled in, but it was quite flavorful.

- Gnudi: I had heard of this dish, but had never tried it. It's like a cheesy gnocchi...like literally. It's bigger than gnocchi, but it's not filled with potatoes, but with soft yummy cheese...and not as heavy as a gnocchi as well. Drenched in an incredible sauce- oh yes, I liked it. I liked it a lot. 

- Big Dipper: Although I loved the gnudi, the big dipper, hands down, won my heart. What...a lobster in corn dog fashion? Oh yes, I want! I exclaimed. I had been fed corn dogs quite a bit when I was small (yes, odd, I know), but I do enjoy them. The dish came out rather cute- the wooden block had three tiny holes to place the corn dogs heads up, with three different sauces- a banana ketchup, some type of apple sauce, and the aioli sauce. Once I bit into it, boy, was I surprised. I was expecting all breading..and found a big lobster ball (like... the deep fried lobster balls in dim sum), in my corn dog. \"OH WHAT!!\" I exclaimed. Love love. I happily dipped my lobster corndog into the sauces, happy with the sauces. All I could say was \"mmmmmMMMMM!\". haha.

And that's all we had. We had both only wanted appetizers to begin with..and we were about to order more, but by the time we finished all of that..we were quite full. haha. I really want to go back and try the entrees though...but man, if the appetizers are that good.... the entrees have to be even better! My expectations are high for later on!

But definitely check this place out. I think it's going to be one of those staples to Cleveland. (you know, one of those must try places?). 

Mmmm. I heart you Hodges. It was good."}
{"text":"Came here for the Tuesday 2 for $40 special. Not very busy on a Tuesday evening at 8pm. Started off with complimentary corn bread, which was pretty tasty with the house butter. Also had the house wine (red). Ordered blue crap hushpuppies for the shared app - mmm so tasty. This was the star of the meal. Fiance had the cab braised beef and I had the shrimp and grits. Both proteins were very tasty but the grits that accompanied it... a bit on the drier side. Also wish there was more protein to carb balance. For my shrimp and grits, there were about 4-5 shrimps with a whole ton of grits. Wish they also gave more sauce for the grits. Nonetheless, all very delectable, just not 5 star delectable. Good deal though. Wouldn't mind going again; this time, I want to try dessert!"}
{"text":"Bravo on the atmosphere, the building and patio are beautiful, but the praise stops there. Staff was non existent, never asked how the food was, left drinks empty, and seemed so careless we wondered if they knew we existed. Came with coworkers and they said their burgers and soup were decent (though cooked incorrectly), but my food was TERRIBLE. Got the chicken parm sandwich and hated EVERY bite. The bun was burnt, the breading was far too thick, the marinara was bland and under salted, and the chicken was HORRID!!! Ive NEVER been served such low quality food. It was chewier than taffy and drier than a desert, not to mention had so little flavor that I dare to say McDonalds can do better. 

Not impressed at all, likely never to return. Would suggest avoiding this place at the risk of playing a flavorless roulette with your food."}
{"text":"Crazy good happy hour deals on a Sunday. We each had a craft beer and split more food than we could finish and our bill was under $50. They have a $7 burger with tater tots during HH that would be twice that price anywhere else."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for years. Did not disappoint!! Amazing ! Wings were fantastic! Caesar salad was great! The tomato soup was fantastic and the Tater tots were off the charts! Finished with the chocolate chip with ice cream. It was all awesome and our server Q was perfect!"}
{"text":"Great great appetizers! Bacon wrapped dates, eggs, and animal tots are delicious. Also love their spicy chicken sandwich and friend pork sandwich"}
{"text":"I've been there twice now, once for dinner and once for lunch.  Both times my meal was FANTSTIC.  I had the Ham shank for dinner and it practically melted in my mouth.  Then the complimentary tater tots and cornbread were also very good, and a nice surprise.  The lunch Mac & Cheese is amazing.  

Service at dinner was very slow, but we planned on a laid back evening out, so we didn't mind it too much.  The lunch speed was normal for downtown, but you don't get any of the extras at lunch like you do at dinner.  I haven't gotten to sit on the patio yet, but am looking forward to spending an evening out there sometime.  Based on my experiences and others, I'd say don't plan on this being a quick meal.  

Bottom line: if you like trying new and interesting foods definitely check it out.  There's nothing \"normal\" about their menu, which is probably the best part of going there.  Have an open mind and time to kill and you'll leave satisfied.  :)"}
{"text":"Save your money and go somewhere else. Average food for inflated prices...cant understand how they are still in business. Everyone in my party was not impressed with their food and surprised at how expensive they were for average food. Too many good restaurants to waste your time and money here.  On the plus side, service was good and they have a great patio."}
{"text":"Even though I LOVE Dim and Den Sum, I had some reservations about Hodge's because the other guy was from Melange (WORSE BRUNCH EVER!). I came here for lunch on Opening Day and was surprised by how smooth the service was and how great the place looked. So A+ for decor and service.

Now onto the food. As another reviewer mentioned their menu was meh, both in the fact that there wasn't really anything special on it and the price is kind of steep. The food was alright...nothing wowed me like their food from their trucks, but I can't really fault them since restaurant /= food truck. I miss their innovative use of crazy ingredients though (fried piggy ears, anyone?)! 

Also where was my cornbread and maple-bourbon butter? The tables next to us got some, but not us? Boo!!!

I guess I will be back for happy hour though since the patio (inherited from Zinc) is awesome. Their cocktail menu looks AMAZING. And I also want to try the Big Dipper (A gourmet corndog? Now THAT sounds more like the food they should be serving.)."}
{"text":"We were really impressed!

Everyone always says to give new restaurants some time - let them work out the problems.  Well, I don't think Hodge's has any problems to work out.  No, it's not the food truck anymore. Anyone expecting the same food should take a look at the menu before you go in and decide if it's right for you. Easy enough, right? 

The service was great - friendly, prompt, not overbearing. They made some excellent choices there.  The drink list is outstanding - lots of original creations!  And if anyone pays attention to my reviews - that is a quick way to this girl's heart. Try the T is for Tomorrow cocktail - bourbon, earl grey tea, cherry liqueur - so good!  

The corn dog appetizer is interesting - lobster, turkey and lamb corn dogs - all with their own dipping sauces.  It was really tasty and I would definitely order it again.  The hanger steak, though.  Oh man.  So good.  

I think they've hit the mark with this one.  I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Hodges. The food is always, without exception, excellent. It's a team favorite for lunch, especially the lunchbox which includes a cup of soup, half a sandwich, and a small salad for only $13.50. It's the perfect choice for someone who can't choose! The service and atmosphere have always been good as well!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were very happy with our meals. I had the arugula salad (due to my obsession with goat cheese) and the mac and cheese. They were both perfectly delicious. During the meal there were a few rain drops and within a minute our waiter came over and put and umbrella on our table. Overall, the food and service were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Came here on a visit from NY and it was such a good time. I ate in their beautiful outside area before heading the a Cavs game across the street.

 I had the $5 Happy Hour Rum Punch and duck wings to start. The wings were phenomenal, crispy on the outside juicy on the inside, not too heavy or greasy. The rum punch was good but realllly weak. Kinda taste like a caprisun. 

For an entree I had the fried chicken with cheesy grits and corn bread. The sides were good the chicken was a lil disappointing. It wasnt overcooked but the crust was a lil burnt (oil was probably too hot). 

Overall id highly recommend it if youre in the area. It can also accommodate large groups really well since the place is HUGE."}
{"text":"a good place if you a classy hoe. the overall issue with this restaurant is that they try wayyyyyy too hard, extra af. Also i literally got 5 raviolis. wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"During my 1 visit - unmatched service.  They brought out tater tots just to hold me over...and the food was still pretty quick.  Also, best patio I have seen in downtown Cleveland (with an outdoor bar).  This kind of real estate is tough to find in many cities.  Food is great, maybe not Greenhouse Tavern quality, but certainly above average."}
{"text":"I visited Hodges on St. Stephen's Day (26 December) for dinner.  I'm in Cleveland visiting family for the holidays, and an old friend is assigned to the Cathedral nearby.  This place was his pick.

Mind you, I come from the culinary capital of the country, Chicago, but I'm a proud Clevelander, having been raised on the West Side.  I am impressed with the selection of restaurants that have popped up in my old hometown.  Hodges is certainly one of them.  

We had a series of \"small plates\" between the two of us.  The goat cheese tart we had was very good, it was a warm, extremely buttery crust and tasty, it did lack that little \"zing\" of the goat cheese.  I think it could have gone that \"extra mile\" and could have been fabulous if they had mixed the greens with it a bit better.  Somehow everything on the platter came together, but not as it could have given my experience with warm cheese tarts I've had elsewhere.  It was good, but with slightly more effort, it could have been better.  Nonetheless, an excellent effort.  

The \"Devils on Horseback\" dates were very good.  Perhaps my prejudice is the marjool dates I get at Avec in Chicago, but I would order these again.  They were flavorful and balanced.  It's easy to over-do it with chorizo because it's such a strong sausage. 

The \"Hanky Pankies\" were good.  It's a classic appetizer recipe from the 80's with a little more imagination.  I think it needs a bit more imagination!  There was a spot of \"fig jam\" on top one could barely taste.  Putting more jam on there would have gone a long way.  The menu mentions crostini. I didn't see any bread on the plate.  Not sure if it was forgotten or not. 

The Blue Crab Hushpuppies: I liked them, but didn't taste any blue crab.  They were good as far as hushpuppies go, however they were a bit bland.

I'll say the highlight for me was the truffle mashed potatoes.  They had a healthy infusion of truffle oil, the potatoes were creamy good.  

Finally, I should say that the ambience was excellent, a warm and cozy place.  The service was exceptional. Our server was the always present but never doting.  The wine list is devoid of any pretense, and served an excellent selection.  I enjoyed a nice glass of Malbec for less than $9.  

I would return.  

For Clevelanders who don't know my reviews, I don't inflate my ratings.  Few experiences are worth 5 stars.  Four is extremely exceptional.  3 is very good.  Two/One stars...well....it's obvious!

Way to go Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Tuesdays are 2 for Tuesdays, and it is worth every penny. I'd heard about Hodge's from a friend, and so I decided to stop up for the Tuesday special. For $40, you get two entrees, an appetizer, and a bottle of wine. Obviously, it's not going to be the best wine you've ever had, but it was good enough for me. They also have plenty of other specials on other days of the week to entice any discount queens like myself.

Even without considering the price, the experience was an all around 4 stars. I didn't think that the food was the best I've ever had, but it was very tasty. The service was one of the most efficient and quickest experiences I've ever had. We were wined and dined in 20 minutes, tops. My water was constantly full, and the waiter kept stopping by to top off my glass of wine. It was an entirely effortless dinner; I didn't have to want or wait for anything.

We started with the goat cheese tart which was sub-par. It wasn't as crispy and fresh as I had anticipated. The crust had a stale, reheated taste. My boyfriend and I both ordered the c.a.b. braised beef which was the star of the show.  The beef was so tender the entire structure fell apart when I poked it with my fork. We were incredibly full from the food and delicious corn bread, so we decided to skip dessert. I'm hoping I can come back sometime and eat the brownie sundae; it sounded fabulous. I will definitely be back to try some of their other entrees."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had our first \"dinner date\" here so I really really really want to love Hodge's.  We came late last summer and they had an awesome patio with a fire pit so it was pretty nice and a great place for a first date.  Being a girl on a first date, I didn't really realize everything (the food, the service, or the cost of the bill at the end of the night) because I was too interested in the boy.  The atmosphere was on point that night though and I left more smitten than the night before.  I definitely recommend sitting outside in the patio area in the summertime.  

Fast forward a several months during a trip downtown looking at apartments and it's cold and raining.  We decide to stop in for a drink and I absolutely fall in love the place again.  There is a marquee sign reading \"Hodges\" lit up above the bar and there are big red bar seats around a dark wood bar.  The atmosphere is once again my favorite part about it which is partially why I'm only giving it 3 stars.  

Let me just spare you the details of every other trip we've made to Hodge's and talk about the food.  Everything we've had has been good but  nothing over the top.  But, the prices are really high.  We came for two for $40 which they do on Tuesdays and we felt like we finally got what we paid for.  From now on, we'll probably only have dinner there on Tuesdays.  We'll still come for the drinks and the ambiance (obviously), I just think the prices are too steep!!"}
{"text":"I've been there for dinner twice, and both times were fabulous. I would always agree to go back. The complimentary tator tots and cornbread are a total win. (The corn bread especially - I could eat the entire thing myself.)

I've tried the steak, veal short ribs, burger, and salmon, and liked all of them a lot. The tuna popper was good, but tasted a little fishy. 

The staff, however, is hit or miss. I've had great service, and other times the waiter was nowhere to be found - this is something I've heard from others as well. Unfortunately - but the food still makes up for any negatives there, at this point."}
{"text":"Just got back from lunch at Hodges and it was AMAZING! The service was great too! Definitely a new Cleveland favorite!"}
{"text":"As someone who has lived in Cleveland for almost three years, I thought it was finally time to go to a place that was CLE famous, especially after seeing the owner featured so much on the Food Network. 

Overall, I LOVED the environment of Hodges. Located downtown on Euclid and right by East 4th, it has the Cleveland environment I was looking for on my Saturday night. We started out with drinks and they were both great. I ordered the Hodge's Punch and it was the perfect fruity drink. My boyfriend went with the draft of the week which he was a fan of after a good sell by our waiter.

We decided to do a taste of each of the areas of the menu (snacks, appetizer and entree) to get a full view of what kind of food they had to offer. The snacks and the appetizers were without a doubt the best. We chose duck confit flatbread and the blue crab hushpuppies and both were great. The personal size pizza was really the size to be a small entree and was my favorite dishes of the night. My boyfriend was a big fan of the hush puppies and thought the sauce was a good mix of flavor without being too overwhelming, and I agree.

We split an entree and the restaurant was nice enough to separate it on two plates for us, so for that service I gave an extra star for sure. We chose the crispy pork cutlet at my boyfriends request and he was a big fan. I, personally, do not love breaded anything but the pork was good in its own sense. The fettuccine it was topped with was really the star of the dish and the big portion size was a bonus. There was definitely enough for us to split and both be full. 

Overall, I would recommend going to Hodge's at least once if you are a Clevelander. The environment alone is top notch (your bill comes in an envelope with \"The Damage\" written on it). I will probably be back but need to explore some more tastes that are right for me. Make sure you read what is part of the dish on the menu!"}
{"text":"The interior is really cool. I love the decor and the heavy red chairs are really comfy. 

Service was good - our waitress Julie was casual but attentive at the same time. 

The food is the reason for the the star rating mostly. Everything I ordered seemed to just slightly miss the mark. Dinner started off strong but became more disappointing as the meal went on. Nothing at all was went wrong or was bad; most things though could have just used a tweak here or there to become something that would make me look forward to coming here again or ordering what I did again if I returned here. 

The cornbread was good - great consistency. I also liked the appetizer of Pot Stickers. I'm not sure what was in them, the menu didn't even say, but the dough was thin and the flavor (and smell) zesty. 

My chicken entree was the most disappointing. I think the menu could have been a lot more descriptive. I got one chicken leg and one other piece of chicken. Had I known this was the type of chicken served in the dish I wouldn't have ordered it. The onion gravy was good, but covered more of the broccoli than it did the chicken unfortunately. And the broccoli cheddar bake didn't have much of any broccoli in it. It was a creamy, cheesy grain-based bake with toasted breading on top. 

All in all nothing I ate will cause me to crave Hodge's. Even the corn bread that I liked...Urban Farmer does better."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times.  The food is consistently good but the service is consistently poor. Recently, we had to ask for appetizer plates after our appetizers were served and ask for plates to be cleared after more food arrived. The waiter was not friendly or attentive. Unfortunately, this was not an isolated experience."}
{"text":"A little mixed on this place.  It is very expensive and I do not feel like it was worth the money.  It is a nicely designed restaurant and feels upscale.  

We got the Risotto and it didn't taste like much at all.  I loved their cornbread, which happened to be the highlight of the meal.

The worst part of the meal:  We sat on the patio and there were fruit flies and other flies that were eating us alive!!! They need to spray for bugs or get some citronella lanterns for outside seating.  We also had 3-4 different servers throughout the meal. 
We were also told they couldn't fit us in for dinner so we started at the bar.  We ate our food, drank our drinks, and by the time we left, half the restaurant was still empty (which is was before we got there as well)."}
{"text":"First time for dinner, had only been here for lunch.  They have a special 2 for $40 on Tuesdays with a bottle of wine, appetizer, and two entrees can't beat it!"}
{"text":"This place has quickly become my Cleveland favorite.  You know when you get tater tots instead of bread it's going to be good.  I love the gnocchi appetizer and the hangar steak was to die for.  The atmosphere is great and the outside patio in the summer is awesome! I definitely recommend. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Hodge's after a job interview. They have a nice bar and seating area outside. It was a rare sunny day in Cleveland so I sat outside of course. I sat at the bar and was greeted by a nice bartender. They have a good selection of beers both on tap and by the bottle. I ordered a pilsner and the cab burger. The burger comes on a nice pretzel bun and is a good size. The burger was cooked perfectly as I ordered it and the beef was juicy and flavorful. The onions and cheese paired well. I liked the tots which were crispy and came with a slightly spicy but good dipping sauce (looked like an aioli). The burger was worth the $13 price. I only wish it came with more of the dipping sauce than a tiny dollop. I had a very good impression during my first visit and will be back in the future, especially if I get the job which is right around the corner."}
{"text":"We like Hodges. Often we go before an event at the Q. Parking is right there. This time we sat at the bar. A patron handed us the Happy Hour menu. Nice. From 4-6 every day or later depending on the night. We ordered three plates. The Trio, the meatballs, the duck confit flatbread. (See my photos.). All were delicious. Select beers and wines were also reduced. I know where we'll sit from now on, except February's Restaurant Week, when entrees are reduced."}
{"text":"Location is a little weird and hard to spot if you're not looking. It's a bit recessed from the street so you're really looking for a parking garage with a Hodge's sign next to it. Food quality is excellent and the dishes are inventive. 

Started with the Korean Chicken appetizer and the complementary cornbread (cute, served in it's own skillet), moved onto the braised veal shirt rib and the night's special, scallops and beef short rib. The veal short rib was really fatty (we were pre-warned) but otherwise i'd order the meal again."}
{"text":"Tuesdays are a good deal, otherwise I don't know if it'd be worth the price.

For $40, we got a bottle of wine (cheap, but what do you expect?), an appetizer and two entrees.  In addition, the wait staff brought out additional \"compliments of the chef\" food, which included tater tots and cornbread.  

I left full, and fairly satisfied.  We got the Pish Sticks, which were good, though not as good as the tater tots, to be honest.  The salmon was perfectly cooked but it was on a lobster mashed potato pile which was utterly disappointing.  The lobster was obviously frozen and there was NO cream in the potatoes...so honestly, it just tasted like boring dry potatoes and it masked the lobster flavor.  If there were creme, it would have been amazing!

We also got the french onion ravioli.  It was good, but if we'd paid the actual menu price, I think we would have been very disappointed.  I also was able to use the french onion sauce on the potatoes...which helped.

overall, for $40, it was a real deal.  We left full and pretty happy.  The service was spectacular too - there was never a wait."}
{"text":"Everything was great. Tater tots, GREAT chicken wings,  complimentary Skillet baked Corn Bread and Shrimp and Grits entree. Service was good."}
{"text":"One word...SALTY! Literally everything I had last night was so salty. I ordered the tator tots appetizer and it was too salty to even enjoy after a few bites. My entree was the burger with a side of their brussel sprouts and that was very salty too! I came with 2 friends and even they said the same thing. I liked the atmosphere and the complimentary cornbread (the only thing that wasn't salty) but I would like it more if they cut way back on the salt! Service was nice, it was pretty dead when we went. Might give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"Very good bacon wrapped dates--slight overpriced though!

A few coworkers and I went for lunch and everyone really enjoyed their food!

I highly recommend the crispy chicken sandwich. The Caesar salad was good too but not a fan of the anchovy on top--I know that's protocol for good Caesar's BUT it caught me off guard. 

Ah!"}
{"text":"I took the steak special challenge. Finished it! Almost! :) it was great. The corn bread with the maple bourbon butter is the best corn bread I've ever had. Great food and a nice place."}
{"text":"First off, we came here on a Saturday night at about 11. Didn't realize they are only open to 11 but they didn't turn us away and they served us drinks at the bar which was nice. When we realized they were closing when we walked in we felt like jerks, but they were really nice about it. 

The four of us each had a drink
Beehive (came in a mason jar), Moscow Mule, & Blueberry something- all awesome. Almost reminded me of VTR. Almost. 

The last drink we ordered was recommended by the bartender as something
\"Sweet and hides the alcohol taste\" which is what my friend recommended. I swear it was not me, I had the Beehive. Her drink was pink and tasted like cough syrup... but I can't fault them for that because that's sorta what she asked for.

Overall, for drinks I give them 5 stars, they were courteous and the drinks were good (mostly). I can't wait to go back and try some of the food!"}
{"text":"Very low quality. The beef flatbread only had a smelly cheese and some braised beef hidden, hard to even taste it..."}
{"text":"I had an extraordinarily good experience here on Tuesday night. I was driving back to New York from Tennessee and staying overnight in Cleveland. My trip was pretty hairy...dodged a few tornadoes and went through some terrifying weather over my 12 hours in the car (solo)...and this came up in conversation with the hostess and bartender.

I decided to sit at the bar and not take up a table even though it wasn't overly busy. There were some large tables with groups towards the back and a few high tops in the front that were occupied. The bar was quiet, so I saddled up to the corner seat since it gave a great view of this very cool, cavernous restaurant.

So why was this so extraordinarly good? It started with the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. Everyone had a smile, was welcoming and helped me pick my beverage (local double IPA - Great Lakes) and meal (Lobster Sliders). Food arrived fast and fresh....kudos to the kitchen staff.

The IPA was delicious and strong....perfect for my eventual short walk across the street to my hotel. Before the sliders arrived, I was given a complimentary skillet of cornbread served with maple-burboun butter. Absolutely delicious and addictive....I probably inhaled at least 3/4 of that skillet. I couldn't stop myself. Wasn't counting calories on Tuesday....!!

The lobster sliders are served on hawaiian bread - so the rolls add a sweetness to the already sweet, fresh lobster. There was a generous amount of lobster on each of the 3 sliders and I happily inhaled all of them. The side of tater tots was also generous - delicious, crispy potato-ey nuggets with 2 different dipping sauces - catsup and some kind of spicy chipotle mayo situation. Soooooo good.

I would be a regular at Hodge's if this was in my neighborhood. I will definitely go back if/when I'm in downtown Cleveland.

Go. Here. Now."}
{"text":"Came in at around 8 on a Sunday, and the place was pretty deserted - save for a few people having some drinks. I had bookmarked this place before coming to Cleveland and I was Yelping some food spots. They seemed to have pretty good happy hour specials but we were too late. So instead, we ordered the Animal tots that everyone seemed to be raving about. This had goat cheese-leek fondue, pancetta, cheddar, pickles, and was topped with fried egg. The first few tots were pretty good, but when I got to my fourth or fifth tot, it was pretty nauseating. Everything was just too heavy and it had a weird old bad cheese taste to it.

Luckily, Hodge's redeemed themselves with the Romaine wedge salad. This had fried onion, pancetta, hard boiled egg, Babylon heirloom tomato, white French, with added herb-brined chicken. I guess my eyes glazed over the wedge part because I was pretty surprised when it showed up. I like my salads chopped but this one was still pretty good, despite that.

Overall, it seems like a cool place to grab a few beers and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I wil be going back to Hodge's.  We sat in the cozy upstairs seating.  The decor is interesting and the server was awesome.
     They give you complimentary sweet potato tater tots with a rosemary aioli!  
     My girlfriend and I had their signature burger.  It was delicious and creative.  Came with a caramelized onion jam and was so much more than your everyday burger with lettuce and tomato.
     My mother had their vegetarian dish and she said it was the best vegetarian dish she's ever had.  My step-dad had the shrimp and grits which was perfect.  
     Well done! I will be going back to try more of their entrees.  
     The place was clean and played good music."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are decent.  Patio is looking worn. Pallets stored in the corners, looks unfinished.  Patio needs to be power washed."}
{"text":"Definitely a place you have to search for, and there's no parking. The atmosphere is great and I love the outdoor section they have with a big screen, a bar, and a couple fire pits. I waited twenty minutes before they took our drink orders, and the drink menu isn't as diverse as you would expect for a sports bar. Same thing with the food. My friend and I both ordered the lobster Mac n cheese. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not a hugeeee fan of lobster, but I am of mac n cheese, and this wasn't the greatest. My friend and I had called ahead of time to ask if they were staying open later for the game and they said yes, but they said they were closing up at normal time and we were brought the check before we could order another round of drinks. Very disappointed because I saw good reviews for this place."}
{"text":"Sorry about the rant but the only way to justify the 1 star is for you to know the whole story. I'll start from the beginning. Friends and I from out of town came here before the Cavs game based on Yelp reviews. We were excited when we got there because it looked like an upscale bar with good comfort food. The place was half empty and we told the hostess we would like a table for four.

Hostess (indignantly): You don't have a reservation?
Us: Nope.
Hostess: Well, I can find a spot for you but you have to be out of here by 7:45. 
(that was over two hours for us to eat what is self described as comfort food)
Us: Perfect, we are trying to get to the Cavs game by 7:30 anyways.

After dismissing the rude hostess, we sat down. Setting was nice, very clean, nice decor. Menu looked nice. But then no one came to help us. After a short while we waved someone down. \"Has anyone come by to help you yet?\" Nope. Do they not have a system? Is it just a free-for-all for the servers? 

The man was friendly enough. We put in our order. We put our appetizers and entrees with our drinks, thinking we were being helpful, since a. we wanted to keep dinner under an 1 hour 45 and b. they demanded we keep it under 2 hours. Twenty minutes later only half of our drinks had arrived though this was quickly remedied when we reminded them. 

While we waited the table to our right was receiving entrees without sides. \"Sorry but we are making the 'tots' now.\" Seemed weird to bring out an entree without the side. Seemed weird that they didn't have tots when they are involved in a lot of menu items. Seemed weird that they didn't have tots when it takes all of 5 minutes to fry a ton of them. 

Meanwhile, we notice our food hasn't come yet. At 45 minutes our crab hushpuppies came. They were good. Points for that. The server placed them in front of one of our group without asking. Theres a wooden thing in the middle to place shareable foods that he could have put it on but our menus were there (we put them there because no one took our menus). However, our waiter came shortly and took the menus and put the food where it belongs.

We asked when the entrees were coming. \"Shortly.\" Next they brought out skillet cornbread for free. It was great.

A short while later, our other dining neighbors asked us if we had gotten our food yet and what we order. They were much more upset than we were (we are pretty chill group). The first table decided to just pay and leave, even though they never got their tots! :(

We asked our waiter again. \"Oh you are up next.\" He only checked in on us when we waived him down... Then a few minutes later the manager (possibly?) came out an apologized for our wait. \"I'm sorry but everyone showed up at once so we are backed up.\" Yes... everyone came at once... at 5:45 on a Saturday night before a basketball game. Thats what people do here... The restaurant isn't that big and the food isn't that complex (we ordered 2 burgers, mac and cheese, and a fried pork cutlet)... 

I think the biggest problem though, worse than the wait, is that we were treated rudely and told we could only have a space (again at a half empty restaurant) if we were out in 2 hours. Then our entrees came an HOUR AND HALF later. What did they want us to do? Power down our food? No time for desert?!? The apology was there but trying to justify the service. And it would have been nice to have something removed from the bill? Offered a free something (though we had no time to wait)? Or anything... oh well.

The sad thing is the food was actually really good. But the service was HORRIBLE. Sucky service ruins everything. Maybe it was a one time thing but at least three tables were not happy... Sorry about the rant again."}
