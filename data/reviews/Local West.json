{"text":"Fantastic food - fresh as it gets.  The burger was right off the farm! Very cool, hip atmosphere...comfortable and will be one of my staples.  The wine is by the bottle, but they cork it to take with you. - And they deliver!  So if you can't get to them, they will get to you!!!  This is one of those places that makes Cleveland cool!"}
{"text":"Went to Local West for the first time on Friday night. Everything we ordered was delicious. The UB40 Poutine was outstanding. Tasted as good as some of the poutine I've had in Quebec. Will be visiting this place frequently."}
{"text":"Delicious! The chalkboard menu is fun and the food was outstanding! We had the Italian Beef sandwich ($10 including side of your choosing) with au jus served on a baguette (the meat tender, the bread awesome), and the The Murv burger ($13 with a side of your choosing) which was equally great.  The side of sweet potato fries were fresh cut and cooked to perfection and the lemon chicken rice soup was seasoned well and a must order!
I really love that this place is in my neighborhood and plan on being a regular, especially when their patio opens! I hope this business succeeds, we need more like it! Great Job!"}
{"text":"Hands down best burger we've tasted in Cleveland! I got the Mac and Cheese burger and my wife got the 50 shades of spice. Both burgers were delicious.They had the perfect toasted bun, thick cut bacon that tasted so good, great fresh toppings and good tasting meat. The only negative thing I have to say, and this comes from someone that is a professional cook, is that their fresh cut fries were just OK. I'm pretty sure they don't blanch them which makes for a not crunchy fry, instead you get a kind of mushy texture. Overall, we liked the atmosphere and we'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Preface: I'm a resident of Gordon Square and want this place to be a success.

Sadly, I did not have the great experience I was hoping for at Local West today. The cashier wasn't able to answer my basic questions about the menu without referring to a cook, who then had to seek confirmation from a 2nd cook on what actually goes on a particular sandwich. Not exactly confidence inspiring. However, the cashier was very quick to point out the $2 up-charge for a side of mac 'n' cheese...

The article in the Cleveland Scene quoted the owners as saying they're shooting for a 5-10 minute wait time. My wait time? - 22 minutes for one of their signature sandwiches and fries. This is simply unacceptable for the lunchtime business crowd, and other diners obviously shared my frustration. Fortunately, despite placing a dine-in order, the cook boxed my order to go. UNfortunately what I found waiting for me in my to-go box were soggy fries and a very soggy, under-seasoned sandwich (see pictures). And, lest any Yelpers think I'm simply being a negative Nancy, my dining partner commented that her cajun chicken sandwich was lacking both cajun flavor and basic S&P seasoning, while the coleslaw topping \"tasted like something from KFC...but the bun was good.\"

I hope this place gets it together quickly, because there are well-known and superior lunch options within walking distance. I'll try again in a few months and update this review accordingly. Approach with caution when you're not in a hurry!"}
{"text":"So, I'm hungry and see this little place.  Pull in walk in and see they have an amazing menu, clean and the employee s are really focused on what I want and getting it to me the way I want it.  What's going on here? A FRESH salmon burger? a m a z I n g Go here."}
{"text":"The food was great!  Whoever cooked our mac and cheese burger did an incredible job. The mac and cheese was creamy and falling off the sides of the burger.  The burger itself was the perfect medium rare.  The service was friendly and helpful.  It was a clean place and so was the restroom.  Sorry I haven't been there sooner."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I decided to try this new place today since it is just down the road. We got there at 12:20, ordered our food inline for dine-in. There were four people waiting in front of us to get their food. The kitchen looked busy and all the guys were working on some delivery orders???? Aren't they supposed to cook the dine-in orders first? Well a lady ahead of us waited for almost 30 minutes for her to-go order. Until 12:55, our orders were still in line not prepared at all. Unfortunately we had to ask them to deliver our food later to our work place because we had to get back to work on time. Finally around 1:30, the food had arrived and they messed up with my order!!!!!! I ordered gyro but instead they gave me a burger with some soggy fries. The burger even had some weird orange cheese on it. Ew!!!!! I am not complaining about the extra tip I paid for dine-in. If the restaurant really wants to win some business, they have to really improve themselves. And the food is just soso. Don't understand why the business was so slow at rush hour. Personally I won't go there in future."}
{"text":"Amazing burger and salmon BLT!!! I went with my boyfriend and another couple. We all agreed we had an enjoyable experience and will be there again and again. The only thing I would suggest is if you are a picky burger eater, like me, order rare if you like med-rare and med-rare if you like medium and so on. If you like rare you might want to stress to them how red and bloody you like it. Service was great and food was excellent."}
{"text":"Really good, not pretentious food with friendly service and great beer/wine selection. I love the transformation of this spot from a former fast food (I think?) place--they did a great job on the interior and exterior vibes. The speciality here is delicious sandwiches, but their sides are not to be underestimated. Lots of vegetarian options, and a handful of vegan options too."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for comfort food then this is your spot. The burgers are juicy but I really love the chicken sandwiches like the Voodoo chicken. The fries are always salty but I like that so if you don't want lots of salt on your fries you can ask. They also have sweet potato fries that are way too thick for me but maybe you like that. 

The people are nice and service is pretty fast. I love that you can see them cook your food in front of you. Plus they are always pushing the limit and trying new things so be sure to look on the chalk board to see what's cooking."}
{"text":"This place is consistently great! They have great quality food and very fair prices. Additionally, the staff are always very pleasant and the service is quick. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Oh my. I can't believe that I have forgotten to talk about Local West. I have to admit that my experiences here are limited to the first menu item that I have ordered. It was so good that I have only chanced my side dish. The Vodoo Chicken sandwich is the bomb for anyone that enjoys spicey chicken (done with spice, not hot sauces). This beauty arrives on a brioche bun, the midevil spiced chicken breast topped with sauteed onions and peppers smoothered in melty cheese. My usual side is the lemon roasted potatoes, but I opted for their fresh cut fries after seeing my co-worker's from the last visit.

She, my co-worker, seems to be stuck on the Mac n Cheese Burger. I have to admit that it looks phenominal with the burger topped with a mac n cheese patty. Seems like the staff has no problems hitting the correct doneness on their burgers (three times and three direct hits). My co-worker is always happy."}
{"text":"My first visit of two was NOT favorable. The cashier was pleasant, as was the grill cook, just not sure what purpose the...I assume day manager?...served. I'll get to that later. Ordered the Old McDonald, and the Telly Melt  BOTH MEDIUM. Clearly marked and reflected on the receipt. Also got the fresh cut fries and a side of the mac and cheese.

The wait, with 2 people ordering ahead of us took 23 minutes. I didnt mind, because I expected the food to be good based on the majority of reviews. Once arrived, after having cut in half the meat was well done. Absolutely no pink or any trace of medium whatsoever. We chose not to bring it to there attention because 6 more people had already walked in, and I didn't feel like waiting 30 more minutes. I can kind of handle a well done burger, so I ate it, begrudgingly. The burger was just a huge, dry mess and hard to swallow. 

The fries were decent, not at all crispy. Mac and cheese was ok, although I question how it was prepared to serve in terms of heating it up. It was barely warm, and it tasted like it had been microwaved. Wasnt bad, just could have been much better.

Now in terms of the \"front of house manager lady\" who goes around and asks how the food is and engages in awkward conversation. Yeah, that one. While nice, she seemed more engaged to sitting down with her friend and chatting while eating a cheese sandwich. When needed she would get up and do what she feels she needs to do. Like disrupting the QUIET atmosphere to turn on ridiculously loud music. It was not a full dining room, music is just not needed at all especially when you have to talk over it.

She finally came over and asked how our food was, so I bluntly told her. I showed her the receipt which said medium, then showed her what was left of what I had, and noted that it wasnt that much of an issue as I can eat well done burgers for the most part, as well as expecting what i request. Her reaction was NOT appropriate. It's the kind of reaction where if you ask a question, you expect to hear a certain positive answer, and if you don't hear what you WANT instead of what you NEED then its a big issue. She apologized, said something I couldn't understand, and left. That was it. Whether she told the cook, I don't know...and whether he cared, I don't know. I wasn't an ass about it. She asked me how it was, and I politely told her. Didnt see or hear from her after that, nor was there any effort to make anything right.

I will give it one one more chance, as there were other items other than a horribly cooked burger I would like to try. Still not off to a good start. I included a picture of said burger next to said receipt."}
{"text":"This place gets a 4 star rating. I'm a fan. If you follow my reviews I don't give too many 4 star ratings. Their food is great. I had their Murv (burger) and the roman (sandwich) both were really good. They also have vegetarian options as well. They have an interesting take too their food and each sandwich is different. They have a big, nice open kitchen where you can see them making your food. I've never had one bad thing from this place. If you go there ask to try a sample of their seasonal soups!

They have a parking lot and take credit too."}
{"text":"We thought the food was wonderful! The hamburger was awesome and might've been the best hamburger I've ever had! The sweet potato fries wern't as good as I had hoped, I'll def go with the regular fries next time! We plan on going back and ordering out from Local West!"}
{"text":"Delivery in less than 30 mins! The driver was professional and kind & the burgers were fresh. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"NOT A GASTROPUB. Been in 3 times, won't be a fourth.. I'd give 2.5 stars if there was a half. Nice option in this area, but everything on the menu should be at least $2 cheaper. I've only gotten takeout, and I'm waiting 15 min++ for a walk in. The last visit was 20+ for a grilled chix sandwich and grilled cheese.. Nice people, average product, incredibly slow."}
{"text":"I've been to Local West three times: once to dine in, once to carry out, and another call in order. The dine-in order (a burger and lemon potatoes) was very good and brought out with surprising speed. After such a great experience, I returned and ordered the Cajun sandwich to go: it was pretty solid, thought the fries were indeed soggy. Giving them another shot, I placed an order for pick-up over the phone for the Upstream. What happened next was beyond explanation.

I was quoted a \"ready\" time of 15-20 minutes, which seemed reasonable. I drove over a bit early, as I wanted to make sure I got it fresh as possible for the 5 minute jaunt home. I then proceeded to wait... and wait... and wait. The very skilled cook/co-owner had my sandwich ready as I showed up- producing an impressed \"wow\" from me. The girl working the register was very pleasant; I paid and expected my food shortly as the place was almost empty except one couple waiting, another group on their way out, and the OTHER owner with what I assume was his family. 20+ minutes went by, on top of my drive/order time (totaling over 35 minutes!) My order just sat there, ready to go, behind the counter as the non-cook co-owner futzed with his family, and attempted to put together the waiting couple's order. The key word here is \"attempted.\" Eventually he seemed to realize \"hey, the only other person here seems to be waiting for something, and hey, there's an order right here!\" Given the wait time due to lack of communication and basic awareness on the part of the staff, my sandwich proved soggy. It's a shame, because if fresh I'm sure it would have been excellent- the bacon was perfect, the salmon was perfect, the nine-grain bread was thick-cut.

Get it together, Local West!  I will be back, as it's just too convenient to pass up, and the food has been tasty when they've gotten it right. I'll update this review as soon I do return, and hope to have better things to say."}
{"text":"I am surprised by myself that it took me this long to try this place because besides pierogi's, sandwiches are my absolute favorite thing to eat! This place has a pretty big menu and the sandwiches are a good size. They sell bottled beer here too ( I had no idea they had any alcohol).

We ordered our food to go and it probably took around 10-15 minutes because of prior people ordering but we didn't mind because the staff here were super nice. They were telling us about all the ingredients they use and all about the restaurant and concept. I ordered the Cuban special which was made with pork loin (yum!!) and for my side I ordered the sweet potato fries. The fries tasted so incredibly fresh!"}
{"text":"So I agree with most that this place has potential and hope they work out the kinks to get everything running smoothly. I live in the neighborhood so would really like to see it succeed. 

I got take out and ordered at the counter. They were very busy and seemed hectic but got to me within minutes. I ordered the Groovy and sweet potato fries which was ready in about 15-20 mins which they told me ahead of time it would be that long. The sandwich was really good and flavorful even without any meat but the sweet potato fries were not done all the way and a bit hard. I believe they bake then or grill them and not fry them which is great but need to be cooked longer. 

I will be going back but may wait a bit to see if they can get everything worked out. Hope to make this place a fast casual regular for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The menu offers a wide variety of great tasting food. In our party of 5 we all ordered something different and each and everyone of us was blown away by the taste, freshness and size of it all! This is a place that you need to come back time and time again to get the full experience. Not to mention the friendliness of the staff and the quickness in which the food was prepared. Along with the food they also have a wide variety of beer to perfectly pair with your meal (and they don't silently judge you for getting a beer with your early lunch!)."}
{"text":"The best damn sandwich in town. The fonz, groovy portobello, bobba feta all are worth your time and money. But nothing beats their side of mac n cheese. Its a must have!!"}
{"text":"Cute little gastropub style spot, built into an old drive-thru restaurant.  Everything appears to be scratch-made including a variety of sandwiches, burgers, salads and pizza...they also have a decent amount of vegetarian options as well!

On this day, I tried one of their signature burgers.  The Murv burger was tasty with bacon, ham, cheese and a fried egg...but it was literally too big to fit in my mouth (due to the patty's thickness) and with all the delicious juices flowing out of it the bun began to disintegrate.  This was my only qualm with the burger as the flavor was spot on.  The fresh-cut fries were very tasty with just the right amount of seasoning.

Will soon be a resident of this neighborhood, will most certainly be back to try other goodies."}
{"text":"I have been to Local West twice. On the first visit, I ordered a Blacon Burger (medium). The burger was delicious -- cooked wonderfully, well seasoned, and all of the ingredients seemed to be of great quality. On the second visit, I ordered the Jalapeno version. Same comments -- nicely cooked, good quality ingredients and great flavor. On both visits I got the mac and cheese as a side. The flavor of the mac and cheese is great, and you know they are starting with a homemade bechamel (complete with nutmeg) and building their cheese sauce from there. If I had to lobby a complaint, it would be that it was a bit oily both times as the sauce had clearly broken (but since i have this same issue half the time I try to make mac and cheese at home, I won't hold it against them). Also, just for the record, I wouldn't hate them if they tried to make some of that bechamel into a pastitsio. 

Anyway, the food was great; the dining room was a little chilly by the window; the prices were fair for the quality if not a little on the high side for a casual place ($14.04 for the Blacon and mac and cheese [which has an up charge]); I didn't wait too long for my food (and even if I did, they just opened -- come on); and the staff was friendly (one of them helped me push my car, which got stuck in the parking lot).

I will be back many many times because I can't think of a better place to get a better tasting or quality fast casual burger."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this place and it was a nice surprise! Looks like they took an old drive thru restaurant and transformed the interior into something fresh, with dangling Edison lights and all! The concept is part fast food, part restaurant. You order in the front and then your food is brought to you and you're waited on from there. The selection is pretty extensive, makes actually picking something somewhat of a challenge. I got The Murv (minus the ham - ended up being a breakfast burger) with sweet potato fries. Feeling accomplished, I then had to pick a beverage and was delighted by their craft beer offering. I then sat down and watched the show, the chef went to town preparing the meal on a small cooking area and voila, masterpiece! The burger was atop a fresh artisanal bun, the bacon was thick and flavorful and the egg was cooked lightly to maintain its runniness. The sweet potato fries were bare bones, cut a sweet potato into wedges and fry. I appreciated its simplicity. The beer was ok, I honestly forgot what I got.

I planned on eating half a burger to maintain my girlish figure and I ended up failing miserably. It was worth it though!"}
{"text":"Great variety of burgers, sandwiches, sides, etc.  Burger was seasoned perfectly and cooked as ordered.  One of the best tasting burgers ever and huge.   Friendly staff and great service."}
{"text":"I got a burger and boyfriend got salmon burger. Both were very high quality and big!  The French fries are really good too.  Can't wait to go back - go to try pizza next time. Only reason I didn't get 5 stars is the price. I get that the products are high quality but I think most people will be shocked at cost."}
{"text":"Best grilled chicken sandwich ever! Tender juicy chicken with a flavorful rub, the slaw they put in it is good & not too heavy or creamy. Friendly staff & reasonable prices! Plus they deliver food & alcohol!!"}
{"text":"I always give a new place two chances, and I hate to say, it has blown the first chance.  

When you go in, the place is nice and clean (a bit small, too).  There are many meal choices that have a bit of a greek flair.  My boyfriend and I went for lunch on a weekday afternoon.  We were able to order pretty quickly, he ordered the old McDonald and I had the Telly Melt, both with fries and we split an order of mac and cheese.  We wanted the burgers to be cooked medium.

I read somewhere that they were aiming for about a 10 minute wait from order to meal presentation.  We didn't think we would wait long as there were only two people ahead of us.  I was wrong, we waited almost 25 minutes. 

We were hoping that the food would be excellent due to the amount of time we waited.  Also wrong.  As I cut into the sandwich, it was not a medium burger that I had hoped for...it was well done and then some.  It was very dry and chewy...it tasted fine, but it would have been so much better if it had been cooked the way I wanted it.  The fries?  Meh, I've had much better.  They were limp and soft.  I like a crunch on my fries and the crunch was definitely missing.  The mac and cheese was cold and disgusting, I could swear it was heated in a microwave.

There was this lady there (a manager, perhaps?) that just kind of roamed around the store.  She would walk around, talk to a customer, sit down to eat, go in back, go outside, come back in, sit and eat some more.  I was kind of upset that she went to turn on this obnoxious music while we were there, the noise level was ridiculous.  If this \"manager\" would have focused more on quality control than stuffing her face and schmoozing with people that are trying to enjoy their food, I don't think there would have been as many issues that there was.

I do plan on coming back to try again, I just hope that they have gotten their shit together in the mean time."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Steak sandwich and portobello sandwich were both delicious, fries were fresh cut and perfectly crisp, microbrew bottle selection was solid, and decor was all well done. 

Service was solid as well - friendly though not gregarious, pretty prompt getting the food out, and asked us how everything was when we were done. Generally everything was great!

Only points for improvement were: the menu/ ordering process could use some fine tuning and they need to work on explaining their sourcing. As others mention, the menu is a happy-dog style pad-n-golf pencil. That works at a bar where you are hanging out having a few beers while you order, but felt like an unnecessary obstacle to the order process when standing at a lunch counter while the staff watches you fill it out. 

Regarding sourcing, we try not to eat meat unless reasonably confident it comes from humane/ non-factory farm sources. We asked the origin of their meats and they told us it was from a butcher in northeast Ohio. That's great and satisfies the local part of the name as to the butcher. But it doesn't address the farm, and even if the meat is from Ohio, there are lots of factory farms here. For a $10 sandy (borderline NY and Boston prices), I want to know my cows and chickens had all the grass time and good feed they wanted and a humane trip to my plate. Maybe that is the case here, but that info has to be on the tip of all staff's tongue or at least on the website/ store materials when someone inquires. 

These are very fixable tweaks, and I'd go from an occasional to a regular if they get those two things right."}
{"text":"Well executed and quick food that fits perfectly in an up and coming neighborhood.  It provides the basics, executed with some creativity (just enough to not be hyper annoying) with solid ingredients, with care for the presentation.  Ordered six items to-go which always takes something away from it's original state-this was not the case here.  Everything was fresh and picture perfect."}
{"text":"Ok found a sandwich I like...the other were good but not yk my \"go to\". 

I like the roman. Very good, bigger in size than I was expecting. I will still try a new one every time I go bc they all look so good. 

They will have desserts in a basket on the counter, they're always fresh and very tasty. 

I got the fries, seasoned well and crispy, and a side of beets. Omg were those yummy!!! They had garlic on them, and I think that was it, but that was all it needed. They should add that to one of the salads, maybe with feta. 

They have craft beer on the board and to the right on the counter there's bottles and cans of other stuff they have. They also carry Ohio City soda. 

There's also like seasonal sandwiches and soups listed on the chalk board. You have to wait a little while for the food but it's like going to Mr Hero you want to wait bc that means it's freshly made. That's a good thing. 

The service...I've never had bad service here. They're always friendly. The person making the sandwiches greets you as you walk in. 

It's always clean and well lit too, just a very attractive space."}
{"text":"Our first visit won't be our last. The Veggie Burger made with black bean and carrot, served on a buttery toasted bun with mixed greens, thin sliced red onion, and tomato was tasty! The Jalapeño Slaw wasn't too wet or too spicy - refreshing. 
My companion devoured his Cow Tipper and Fries, which he described as juicy and delicious. The fries were nicely salted. 
You order and pay at the counter, but they bring your food to the table and bus when you're done. Good selection of bottled beer and nonalcoholic beverages. Very friendly staff. 
We shall return!"}
{"text":"Just ate there this evening.  I was not expecting it to be almost cafeteria style with diners ordering at the counter and then your food being delivered to your table.  Other than that minor surprise, I was completely happy with my meal (Italian Beef sandwich), and my partners Margarita pizza was just right as well.  The staff was very attentive, and unlike some of the other reviewers we did not have to wait long at all for our meals.  Cute place, very moderately priced wine selection ($15 bottles), good food, and plenty of parking.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Healthy, delicious food and vegetarian/vegan friendly (meat options too). Great beer list, wine. Reasonable prices. Friendly people. Patio. Score! Check it out."}
{"text":"Always love grabbing a quick lunch here in Gordon Square! It's delicious and healthy.  Soups, salad, sandwiches  and all the good stuff!"}
{"text":"Lots of interesting veg options. The Very Vegan sandwich was big but the thick slice of soft eggplant had very little flavor and was really mushy. The Mac and cheese was rich and subtly sweet. The fries were nice and crisp and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland and our son had not tried this place yet - so we thought today would be a good day to try it 

They have a number of signature sandwiches my wife and I shared the Italian Beef there are a number of sides we chose fries.  Very good taste enough for two. 

They also sell wine and beer we purchased a bottle of 19 Crimes Red Blend at $18. 

Our son had Cajun chicken with Mac n cheese. 

Total cost with tip $54.87"}
{"text":"I love it!  The place is so cute and I love the wine and beer selection.  I had the salmon burger and lemon potatoes and they were perfect!  I know some reviews  have said something's are off but give it some time.  For being open less than a week I'm sure they will work it out.  

I know the owner sources a lot locally and provides a more than fair price for my meal and I'm not mad a a good bottle of ten dollar red!  Plus. Deliver?!  Sold!  Welcome to the hood!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. The menu is what drew us in it sounded amazing. We ordered the salmon burger with three bean salad. The salmon was ground fresh the only thing is it was lacking in flavor. The Italian Beef was huge, seasoned well but the meat was very dry. We were excited to order the octopus salad, the octopus was cooked perfectly the only problem the cucumbers were seasoned with hair. Not cool. Not a great first experience. Hopefully it will be better next time."}
{"text":"All in all, solid addition to the area. Some thoughts on what I've ordered here so far:

Italian beef - pretty good, but not as good as Chicago Italian beef. The jus could come in a bigger/wider bowl to make dipping easier. The hot peppers were also not really hot. Again, take note of giardiniera from Chicago.

Mac and cheese - disappointing. I found it to be very bland and very mushy. Kind of reminiscent of baby food.

Fries - solid, but a little soggy. I wish they had some house ketchup or sauces for dipping.

Voodoo chicken - very good. The size of the chicken breast is perfect, well worth the price. However, it could be more flavourful, and I was looking for some more heat. I was expecting a real spicy taste and didn't get it.

UB40 poutine - the Kevin Love of poutine: not bad, but not the superstar I was hoping for. Again, this wasn't as flavourful as I'd like. The fries themselves were good. The braised beef was a little tough and chewy. If the beef were more tender and if the sauce had some more kick, this could be Kyrie Irving.

Jalapeno coleslaw - blech. It was like KFC coleslaw, add a couple bits of diced jalapeno."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get food at a reasonable price. The service is great, the food is fast but farm to table. This is a great spot for a quick bite or to hang out with friends and chat. It's casual."}
{"text":"The good- nice menu, enjoy the options and specials. Staff was friendly. Good fries, good flavors  on the burger and it's plenty of food
The meh- the burgers I ordered medium and came out well done with no medium leaning what so ever. Maybe under order and hope for the best
The Mac and cheese did not do anything for me a bit dry. 
Being in the neighborhood I'll give them another chance, but I've had better success with burgers at Hex."}
{"text":"Service has improved dramatically and I remain addicted to the Italian Beef Sandwich. They did a great job cleaning up and decorating the patio - which is now a great place to watch all kinds of neighborhood happenings. 

I've heard from people who know that they have a great burger - so that's next on my list."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this establishment but I will DEFINITELY be back. The food was awesome and they have wine!! It's not extremely big but there is seating and the place was spotless. I didn't have to think twice about dining in. I had the chicken sandwich and fresh cut fries and my lunch date had the Cajun chicken over slaw with the Mac n cheese. It all looked so good that we shared! The staff was friendly and the place is up on modern technology. I was able yo pay and tip via their tablet type register. My receipt was even emailed! I would recommend this place for an awesomely fresh and quick meal."}
{"text":"We decided to give the delivery a try. The food was excellent!  The customer service  (person on the phone and the driver) was friendly and quick! We will definitely be ordering here again!"}
{"text":"Great food, not so great service. Good drinks and sandwiches and great sides. Took me 20 minutes to get my good though, it want even busy, it is a very small resrurant with only afew people in it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!! Best lunch I've had in recent memory! Burger was huge, fries were cooked perfectly, ingredients were fresh. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Take a slightly confusing concept, add an unnecessarily long wait time, sprinkle on some high prices and throw in some just OK food and you've got the recipe for a big loaf of letdown. For me, Local West was just disappointing.

Another new addition to the Cleveland-area fast-casual dining scene, Local West, calling themselves a \"craft sandwich and beer bistro\" just didn't live up to my expectations. The basic concept is upscale sandwiches and burgers made to order using locally-sourced ingredients. Oh, and they have some bottled craft beer and wine for sale. Nothing new, that's for sure, but Local West definitely has some work to do.

The building, which looks to have housed a KFC at one point, has had many tenants over the years including something called the Greek Grill Cafe. The new occupants have done a pretty good job of transforming it into something of a Chipotle-esque eatery complete with open kitchen in the back, wood-topped tables, aluminum chairs and lots more wood covering the walls and ceiling. It's brightly lit, open and has a nice vibe.

The menu features burgers and sandwiches, all made with Ohio-raised protein, along with a few other items I'd lump under \"other\" like poutine and grilled octopus. A handful of salads and pita pizzas round out the offering. Burger prices (which include a side) range from $8 for your basic cheeseless LTO up to $13 for their top-of-the-line bacon, ham, cheddar and fried egg variant. Other sandwiches on the menu will set you back about $10 and everything's served a la carte, with sides like sweet potato fries and 4-bean salad coming in around $3.50 each.

The concept is supposed to be your basic made-to-order, fast casual type of restaurant, but it gets a bit muddled in this particular model. As I mentioned earlier, it's not very straight forward. Leading the mixed message parade are printed menus in notepad format along with golf pencils on the tables. Naturally, this would lead you to believe that you're supposed to fill it out and wait for someone to pick it up, right? Nope. Ordering is done at a cash register in the back by the kitchen. TI don't know what the check-box menus are for. They don't really seem necessary.

Now for the biggest letdown of our visit. The waiting. Holy shit, it seemed like it took forever and, after reading the other reviews, I know I'm not alone on this one. We were essentially the only couple in the place and it took nearly 25 minutes for them to make two sandwiches! What happens when there's a real crowd? If you plan to visit here during your workday lunch break, don't. Or pack a lunch to eat while you wait.

Another issue I had was with the self-serve water station in the dining room. I don't necessarily have a problem getting my own water, but how about putting out some adult-sized cups or, better yet, just giving me a glass with some ice in it when I place my order. Those little plastic cups have gotta go.

What about the beer? With \"craft beer\" in their logo, I just expected more. Beer is bottles/cans only and average about $5 each. Not bad. They do have a decent selection of local beer, too. The 6-pack pricing they have listed on their website is laughable. Fat Head's Bumbleberry for $21? On what planet? Yes, you can buy beer (and wine) here, but it feels more like an afterthought.

I'm not one to harp on higher than average pricing, especially when the quality of the food and the service warrant it, but it just wasn't the case here. My wife's salmon BLT (called the Upstream on the menu) was a bit of an assembly disaster. As soon as she picked it up to eat it, everything simply fell apart. Good flavor, cooked well, but a sandwich that couldn't be eaten like a sandwich. The mac and cheese side she ordered was average at best, very mushy and lacking texture. It reminded me of Stouffer's, seriously.

I ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and a side of sweet potato fries. No heat whatsoever in the spice rub used on the chicken and the jalapeno slaw was both dry and underseasoned. I could barely detect jalapeno flavor at all. When you order a \"Cajun\" anything you at least expect some presence of chili pepper. Not here. I'd recommend reworking that slaw by adding more jalapenos and some mayo. The chicken was also a bit overcooked. The skin-on sweet potato fries were OK. Nothing special and, if anything, not crispy enough. I don't really think that sweet potato skin lends itself to fries very well. It's a bit chewy.

There were a number of variables that went into this rating, but if I had to weight them, I'd say that having to wait nearly 30 minutes for our order in a practically empty restaurant is up there. Maybe that's why the sting of paying over $30 for a lunch that included two sandwiches, two sides and an iced tea was so pronounced. Maybe if our food was prepared in line with this pricing. Unfortunately, an experience that has a customer wondering about maybes doesn't lead to repeat business."}
{"text":"Freshness at it's finest. I admit that I don't eat here often, even though it's only a block from my house. I don't do fast casual that often. However, when I do get in there, it is always right on the mark for what I craved. The folks who work there are always nice, and when the weather permits, their patio is a great spot to eat and hang out."}
{"text":"Fun little spot for burgers and sandwiches. We stopped in for a late lunch after a trip to Edgewater Park. It's only about a half mile away so a perfect stop after the beach. We had our dog with us so sat on the patio, which was perfect. We enjoyed a mix of sandwiches and burgers and we're pleased with the vegetarian and vegan options offered. Everything was huge, especially the burgers which were really thick. For sides, the sweet potato fries and 3 bean salad were clear winners. They also looked to have a large beer selection but we didn't try any."}
{"text":"Eat here often living a couple of blocks away, and have never had a bad meal. Food is always fresh and served in great portions. From the salads to their gyros and fresh cut fries you will not be disappointed. Guaranteed to convert you into a repeat customer."}
{"text":"So I was up by the shore and looking for a great burger spot and found this little gem on yelp, of course! When I pulled up the building looked like the old shell of an old fast food joint. 

I decided to roll with the \"Murv\" which was a burger with the fixins, bacon, ham and an egg....it was GIANT! Excellent flavor even though I could hardly get my mouth around it (but I made it happen lol)

The fries were really good! Not too salty but also had some flavor to them. 

Lastly, the homemade mac and cheese was the BOMB!!! Verrrry cheesy, it almost melted in my mouth. 

This place is carb heaven!!! Good thing it's bulking season. :)"}
{"text":"I had the Italian beef sandwich.  It was really good.  Ask for au ju on the side.  I love the  home made soups.  I had the Lentil soup this time.  I have never been a fan of Lentil soup but this soup was soooooo good.  I would order it again.  If he ever puts his wedding soup on the menu...it is a must to order.  Another soup I have never liked but his is amazing.  Portions are good too.  I seen someone complain about soggy fries..you can get them separate from sandwich and they stay fine.  Yes , when they opened they were really busy but your wait still wasn't long and people need to give them a chance to learn the menu by heart.  It's new and not everything will be perfect.  I really hate impatient people.  I was a server and I know what it's like.  Hang in there it will only get better.  Good luck, Local West!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good. It could be great and my hope is that it gets there. The sandwiches are good, and close to where they need to be for the price point. Delivering beer and sandwiches is enough to keep me a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to stop here for a while now and finally did a few weeks ago. Sandwiches were exceptional, sides were OK. I had the chicken In the club sandwich with mac and cheese which were both delicious. Some members with me got the jalapeño slaw and could have done without it, didn't have much taste. We sat on the patio, you order at the counter and they bring it out to you. It did take about 30min if not a little longer for our food to come out but we were also a group of 7, so it was expected to take some time. Overall everyone enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because the food is fantastic. I would like to see a few more vegetarian options since my girlfriend does not eat meat, but everything I've had on the menu is very good. If you're doing take-out, I'd recommend calling in. Everything seems to be MTO so it can take a little while. I think the pricing is fair for what you get. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I do not know how we have lived down the street from local west for 6 months are just now trying this awesome little gem.  We have gone several time since our first time.  We have also gotten take out and they deliver to the brewery down the street.  They have veggie options which is major plus!! This place has became our take out go to."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The burgers are the size of your head, they are cooked to perfection, and the selection is awesome as well! Angela who was working was an absolute pleasure and great to interact with as a first time customer here. Come check out the awesome atmosphere, solid beer selection, and tasty food!"}
{"text":"bomb lunch spot! i eat here at least once a week. yet to eat something i didn't like. favorites are the octopus and the chicken gyro. family owned and operated which is worth five stars alone, great people."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. They do right what they need to do right to be good. There are a couple things they need to do to be great. At night, they need to find a way to switch out of the lunch atmosphere. Also, expand beer selection. But the mac and cheese was great. I was also a fan of the music selection."}
{"text":"I always pass by this place going to and from work and I kept saying to myself, \"I should check that place out\" so this last Saturday night, I finally did. Overall the presentation of this spot is really cool. Very laid back. Typical of the type of restaurants popping up Downton and around the Westside of Cleveland. The new emergence of hipster, trendy food spots. But I must say I don't mind it. The menu itself has a pretty large variety of items from burgers to sandwiches to wraps to gyros. After being slightly overwhelmed by the many appetizing looking choices, I decided to go with the Cajun Chicken Sandwich.  Overall I wasn't disappointed with this choice. The chicken is a nice sized breast with Cajun Seasoning and slightly blackened on each side for taste. Also on the sandwich there was jalapeno lemon slaw which didn't have much of a taste but didn't take away from the sandwich. I chose fries for a side item. This place isn't a cheap meal by far but it's worth checking out for its many choices of food alone. Not an every day or week spot but I will for sure add it to my go to spots from time to time."}
{"text":"I went here again thinking I should give it another chance and man did it disappoint me. I had the chicken club and all I can say is: it was just \"BLAH.\" And if I'm paying $12 for a chicken sandwich it better be more than just alright. 

This place has the potential to be a really cool and good restaurant but every time I eat here I feel like they are missing one BIG important ingredient. I'm not too sure what is but it could be faster service, less confusing ordering or tastier food. 

The concept of this place is good but they are missing something huge. I think they need a consultant to come in and fine tune their process."}
{"text":"Hit this place up after a long week. Snagged the Murv and sweet potato fries. I was not disappointed. You get exactly what you expect and more. This is going to become one of my go to spots for takeout. Kinda awkward eating inside there I'd say - but, like I said, the food is dope."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland on business, and went to lunch here with one of my suppliers.  Very cool little shop, quick service.  Their chalkboard menu is cool and creative, with many options.  I went with the Italian beef sandwich and a side of fries.  The fries were cut fresh, and very tasty.  

I give this a 3-star rating because of the sandwich.  I had a couple of issues with it.  First, they put pickles on it.  Never seen that done.  Second, they didn't dip the bread before they made the sandwich.  The dip is served on the side, au jus style.  I've been to Chicago, and this was just a roast beef au jus.  Only my opinion.  The beef and au jus was good, just not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"I honestly have never written a Yelp! review until now, but have been using Yelp for many years. I felt compelled finally! :)

This was my second experience at LocalWest and it was just as awesome as my first one. My first visit I dined in; today I received carry-out. 

I live just a couple streets past W. 117th and while the lady who took my order said they typically don't go past W. 117, she gladly took my delivery order. Yasssss!

I got the Voodoo Chicken sandwich and OMG, was it amazing! I love spicy items and have tried many versions of VooDoo Chicken dishes/sandwiches. I have to say this one took the cake. The flavor was amazing and the bun was perfectly toasted. Mac-N-Cheese was just as tasty, cheesy and fresh as I remembered it from the first visit. I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, which are one of my favorites. Nice and thick. You can tell they are either par or triple cooked, which is the secret to great fries! 

Only took about 25-30 mins for delivery and everything was still hot! The name on the ticket was Terry M. and who I believe took my order and delivered it, was super nice! 

Really, each time has been a great experience. Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"1st time here.  
-Has its own lot to park.
-nice decor- like the feel of the place
-easy to read chalkboard menu
-cashier to cooks- all super nice
-clean!
-some will think it's pricy, but my sandwich was more then I can eat, had left overs
-the wait was about 15 minutes for 1sandwhich.  I'm ok with that! It means they are taking the time to make it good!


The food
- had the roman which is like an Italian sub toasted. It was a good size, not to little nor too much meat/toppings, it was perfect! Excellent flavor and very fresh!
-had a side of their homemade Mac-n-cheese- it was just eh. No real flavor, and I like a creamy Mac n cheese which this was not. My 15 year old ate it no prob tho. 
-the sweet potato fries- yes yes yes!! Love them!  I especially like when i get an outside edge of the potato with the skin!  Yum. No sauce needed. 

Looking forward to coming back and trying different things on the menu!!

Been here a few more times.  I don't think there's anything I don't like here!   

Update!! I've had the mac-n-cheese again, and it was creamy and flavorful!! I loved it!! Maybe that last time was just a fluke.  I ate it faster then I could take a pic!"}
{"text":"If the unique names of each dish don't catch your eye at this diamond in the rough, the well-priced craft beer variety and cool atmosphere will win you over. There is truly something for everyone, like the delectable grilled cheese for my picky eater and amazing \"Boba Feta\" for my connoisseur son. Not your basic grilled chicken sandwich, the meat was well-seasoned and juicy, topped with freshly sautéed spinach, tomato and tangy feta cheese. It was exceptional! My husband had the Roman, which was huge and full of flavor. It was the perfect contrast of salty meats, banana peppers, greens, and balsamic. The atmosphere was casual, yet trendy and still family friendly. We enjoyed a spontaneous Sunday afternoon treat and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Perfect! These are the words my husband and I spoke while enjoying our lunch here. I had a salmon burger, he had the chicken club, we had great fries along with a side of the lemon potatoes. The only other word to describe our lunch would be YUM. It only furthered our enjoyment to receive such great service!"}
{"text":"very impressed... a real bright spot. Sit down or take out... good value. Burgers are excellent and innovative. (just wish I would of had a pickle). Great choice of sides and non-burger meals. Support this resto, and their mission to bring to your table local ingredients done with a creative edge, without the price of white tablecloths."}
{"text":"Priced right!
Delivery time was excellent.
Food (2 burgers with fresh cut fries)had great presentation, but no flavor, just beef and lots of it. 
Will try again, just not a burger."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with some co-workers and all of us were extremely happy with our burgers. The burgers themselves and everything on them (lettuce, onions, tomatoes, etc.) tasted so fresh! I got the Mac & Cheese burger, which was too big for me to finish. The mac and cheese alone was expertly crafted. Add it to an amazing burger and you've got paradise. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I love this new restaurant in the Gordon Square Arts District. They totally transformed the interior and exterior from what it was and the food is great! Fresh cut fries, excellent sandwiches, homemade soups, friendly people who work there. Two thumbs up. Glad to have them in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"I absolutely recommend this place and love everything it has to offer! Come for a great meal and enjoy a glass or bottle of wine with it! They also serve beers. 

The menu is fresh, unique and offers something for everyone. I had the voodoo chicken sandwich and chose the Italian wedding soup as my side. They offer many different sides and the soup was delicious. Perfect on a cold winter day. They serve lunch and dinner. The menu includes salads, sandwiches, gyros, pizza, soups, cold slaw and much more!! Can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here and trying new sandwiches. They surely don't disappoint me. Great food, always clean and friendly and funny staff, always making you feel like a local. 
Today I had the Cubano Sandwich with sweet potatoes fries and was really tasteful. Every time I see on a menu at restaurant is must for me to give it try. 
I sure will be back to try more"}
{"text":"This hands down on my top 5 burger list. I had the murv it was off the hook  this spot is a must they have fresh lemonade"}
{"text":"Food: Creative mixes and flavors for sandwiches and burgers -- lots of credit for the work and inspiration that went into the menu. I loved the Telly Melt, which had a nice golden brown, buttery toasted slices with perfectly melted gooey cheese with the burger (I went housemade veggie patty, but I'm sure other burgers work great in this too). Every bite made me want another. They also have local beers, making this a nice after work or lazy Saturday place. Only wish on the food side was that the healthier sides (that is, other than the mac n cheese or fries) were more attractive to me. Sorry, it's tough to explain and I think they change from time to time.

Service/Atmosphere: Good, smiley, patient folks (even with a line). Space was clean, bright and even has a small patio for warm days. I got lucky and grabbed a seat outside with my Telly Melt. Awesome."}
{"text":"Updated Review* 2nd time visiting, and again, I am in awe. Was served once again by the amazing Adrian. He is super helpful and friendly.This time we ordered: The \"Salmon Burger\" with fries, & \"In The Club\" with fries. 

1) The Salmon Burger was huge. A lot bigger than I expected and quite tasty!! A few turns of fresh black pepper and salt from the table alongside extra tzatziki sauce and VOILA! *Magic*! 
2) My friend ordered \"In The Club\" and she had no complaints! 
Everything is delicious and fresh, and I'm sure this will end up being one of our regular locally owned spots to grab food from!"}
{"text":"This is a total surprise to find in Cleveland. It has really fresh food with lots of choices.  Must try.  My boys powered through a huge burger and fries.  We will be back.  Found this in Yelp and it is a gem."}
{"text":"Hey guys, sorry to do this but I have to make this known. Love the food, love the atmosphere, but last night I basically had the most uncomfortable experience that people shouldn't have to deal with.


Basically this wacky ass high dude waltzed in and starts bugging me and my boyfriend for our food, our beer, money, and I tried to be nice about it but COME ON. We eventually gave him a side of Mac n cheese so he'd leave us alone.


The kicker is the staff was watching the whole time and couldn't care less...they even said bye to him by name on his way out.

Sooo Local West, you're familiar with this guy, see him come in and interrupt our date and don't say a word?? 

It sucked. I guess I'll just get delivery from now on...that part of town gis sketchy anyway. :("}
{"text":"I recently tried this restaurant for the first time and loved it!! However, I didn't actually go into the place, I just got delivery. Regardless, it came quicker than they originally quoted. The food was hot and delicious! I got one of the Pita Pizzas and some fries and both were perfect. The pizza could be a full serving for someone, but I ate the pizza and about half the fries and then I was full. A little pricey for me BUT it was so yummy and there were so many options on their menu that I will definitely be ordering again. Great option for delivery."}
{"text":"Fresh farm to table ingredients! We got the Cow Tipper and Blacon Burgers with fresh cut fries. Huge portions we couldn't finish. Will definitely share next time as get an extra side."}
{"text":"Met the owner and he was extremely friendly, and the staff is always the same. Prices are a bit high sometimes, but the unique food and great customer service has made it my favorite place to eat in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Cubano sandwich is one of the top sandwiches in all of Cleveland. They should have it on the permanent menu. It is a great take on the Cuban. Have had almost every sandwich/burger on the menu and all have been good. One of Cleveland's most underrated gems"}
{"text":"I'll probably go back to try something else but today I ordered a telly melt burger. I ordered it medium and it came out well done. I paid extra for a fried egg and it was cooked over hard, I didn't know I needed to specify that it should be over easy. The burger had no flavor. The sweet potatoes fries were good but a little under cooked. The staff was very friendly and attentive but the food was underwhelming."}
{"text":"I've been to Local West twice since they've opened and both experiences were great. Everyone that I've had wait on me were efficient and friendly. The \"Cow Tipper\" burger was delicious with some excellent bacon on top. Both soups I've ordered were tasty.  The restaurant was busy when I was there but my wait wasn't long. I think for the first few days of being in operation that they are doing a great job. Both times I was there were not lunch hours so maybe that's why my experience was different than the other negative reviewers. I will definitely be back and think that this restaurant could fill the needs of casual diners in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I'm not much of a sandwich gal. I'd much rather have Chinese, Indian, or Mexican on my lunch breaks. However, I have enjoyed Local West multiple times. The food is always fresh, the service is good, and I really enjoy the variety of options. This isn't just a basic sandwich shop, and I really like that. I'll be keeping this place in my lunch rotation for sure!"}
{"text":"Not many places in this area deliver which is one of the reasons I keep going back. Honestly though, I haven't tried anything that blows me away. I've tried the Telly melt, French fries, Mac and cheese, the super Mario burger, and two different soups of the day (broken up amongst different visits). Everything is lacking in seasoning. It's not the worst by any means, I've just had better."}
{"text":"This place is a delight. We went with our two kids and had an amazing lunch. 

We got the salmon BLT, chicken sandwich, regular fries, sweet potato fries, Greek salad, and Mac and cheese. We would get it all over again, except the Mac and cheese. Sadly. 

Tasty beers. 

Great service. 

Fresh food. 

Yum!"}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious! For real people. What the heck was I doing with my life before this vegan possibility for a sandwich arrived?? 

Wait, wait... Let's start from the beginning. I came in here with a friend after spending some time at Edgewater. We wanted a casual place because we were a bit hot and sandy. We looked around on Yelp, and with me being vegan, they had several options for me: Win. So we came to Local West!

Located in an old drive-thru of sorts, and in the midst of construction chaos, lies a restaurant everyone in Cleveland should support. The interior is very casual, a mixture of rustic and farm, and small-town feels. We were greeted by a friendly girl who took our order, remaining patient until we decided. I, obviously, went with the Very Vegan sandwich, my friend had the Voodoo. 

There was only one gentleman in the back running the kitchen, but he clearly is a mastermind. He was quick, the ingredients he uses are fresh, and the sides were BRILLIANT and far from the norm: The pickled tofu and veggie side---that was to die for. Literally, I want to eat it again right now. But do not worry, they have some traditional and well-desired sides for those of all food categories and diets. 

They have beer and wine, as well as lemonades, etc. 
The staff keeps the restaurant clean and fast paced. They will chat with you and they were seemingly great at remembering regulars, etc. 

It had such a great family, home-grown feel, with the flavors and menu items of eclectic culinary brilliance. 

Will be back as much as possible. :)"}
{"text":"So, my husband and I were looking for something a little different.  We did want a loud Mexican restaurant (it was cinco de Mayo) or a loud sports bar.   We found this gem on our yelp app and decided to go.    We were the only ones there, which baffles me.  This restaurant is fantastic.   Decor-wise it is a little county and a little industrial.   At this place, you order at the register and are served after you sit down.  We both got a sandwich and soup (50 shades of spice and the Fonz) (chicken lemon orzo, and corn chowder) and shared some poutine.   The names were fun and they had interesting flavor combinations.   I got the 50 shades and it was fantastic and interesting.  This sandwich has goat cheese with orange zest.  The poutine is not like I have ever tasted as I think it had curry in it.   

The staff were nice and accommodating and I can't wait to try it out for lunch.     I recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"I had their \"Super Mario\" burger with the four bean salad side.  It was fantastic!  Had a UFO beer and I was most content!  I highly recommend this place.  Don't let the simple exterior fool you: they have high quality, great tasting food and superb service from a very attentive staff!

Also, I was very pleased they had real silverware and glassware for eating in, and did not use styrofoam."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. The burgers are very flavorful and they deliver which is a nice plus. Everything is made on the spot and their menu is very diverse. I want to try several more items on it!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for take away for my first visit here. 

I got The Roman ($10) sandwich that came with one side. The Roman contained a thick layer of pepperoni, ham, delicious pepper rings, a little provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion and a perfectly balanced balsamic dressing applied in just the right quantity. This was all put on ciabatta bread that got toasted like a panini. For my side I chose one of the two soups of the day, a Cannellini Bean. 

Other sides included your typical cold deli options such as pasta salad, a 4-bean salad and cold beets. Beer and wine are also served in the seat yourself and self-serve style café. 

I did find it odd that the place was empty at 5p on a Wednesday and there were four workers present, but I was happy with my food and would return for a quick fast food meal. They also delivery locally for $2."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went here based almost purely on Yelp reviews and being in the area. There are many vegan/vegetarian options. As well as other options you won't find in this area. If anyone understands how hard it is to satisfy a vegan or vegetarian, just know that I was satisfied. Go here!"}
{"text":"This place is cute! Very hip, has burgers, sandwiches, salads, and beers. Lost a star because the wait to order was too long. Lost another star because half of my group said their burgers were just ok. Two people got the cow tipper and said it was kinda dry and not very seasoned and meh fries. I however did like my salmon burger. Nice big portion, moist unlike a lot of salmon burgers. The grilled zucchini side was alright, cold and just meh. Also the price was a little steep for what we got, but I left full and satisfied. Not the greatest burger joint, but not the worst."}
{"text":"Great gyro pizza. Definitely coming back.  The salads were beautiful, also.  I wasn't drinking but looked like a good beer selection.  And it's nice it has it's own parking lot, a lot of places in the area do not have that."}
{"text":"I'll start with describing myself as a very picky eater who always finds something wrong. However, Local West hits the spot with their sandwiches and soups. It has a huge menu and always a rotation of fresh hot soups. Everything I have tried with chicken has been delicious.
The staff are nice and take their time to prepare everything just right. I do not mind waiting for a great meal."}
{"text":"Just finished a tasty lunch. I had the Italian beef signature sandwich.  The bread was fresh and crusty. The beef with lean and tender. Italian peppers rounded out a flawless sub. As a side I had the four bean salad.  It was tangy with excellent flavors, but that didn't mask or render the beans mushy. My wife had a beef poutine.  It was hearty and warm for a cold Cleveland day. I will visit again soon as the menu is varied and inviting."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Premium quality food and everyone is so nice! Highly recommend. We got the two specials and the fries were divine."}
{"text":"This place has potential. A lot of it! Are they perfect? no. but hell they haven't even been open for a week yet, they have to figure things out as they come, It will take work but I'm confident they will get there. with that said:

I walked in d-day +1. mid-day no line. My friend and I walked up and ordered the poutine and the 50 shades burger, with beers. I devoured my burger. It wasn't the easiest to eat. but i got it down The LTO made it really thick plus the burger wasn't pack right so it balled up. but still the orange peel goat cheese was on point. i got a side order of the lemon potatoes and those were tasty. My buddy ordered the UB40 poutine, I tasted ok, but we were really impressed with it. Especially since it is their signature item.

Menu definitely has a greek flare to it. but over all the menu seems to be all over. the menu seems to hover around the $10 price point. I will go back, but i think i will wait a month so they can work their kinks outs. I would like this place to stay, there is potential.

If the owners/managers see this please message me. I have a few questions."}
{"text":"Just love this restaurant, the vegetarian options are great and the aesthetics of the restaurant are nice."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Saturday afternoon after going to the West Side Market. Doesn't have much curb appeal, but don't let that fool you.  Once inside, it is clean with a casual urban feel. 

I stopped because I was thirsty so can't comment on food other than the pickled zucchini salad which was excellent, just the right amount of heat and spice. 

The staff were friendly and helpful. I definitely plan on returning to try a burger. I feel without tasting more than a side I can't honestly give it 5 stars although I would certainly like to based on this quick visit."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in the neighborhood. Hands down. Super chill atmosphere and truly amazing food. Staff has always been friendly and delivery has always been fast and accurate. Recommend the burgers with a side of Mac n cheese- my personal fav. :)"}
