{"text":"Wanted to try something new with the fam, because we got sick of Pizza Pizza, so we tried this place out, and we absolutely loved it. They're really nice and friendly. I haven't enjoyed pizza in a long time as much as I enjoyed this place. Their prices are really great, and the deals are really worth it. We got 2 large pizzas, one being chicken, bacon, and jalape√±o (I know, weird), but it was really good. First time trying that topping combo. They put a lot of meat. And the #1 thing I loved was that there was barely any grease. Whenever I ordered from Pizza Pizza, and we finished the pizza, you would see the grease marks on the box, but this place, there weren't any, and that's a big plus. To wrap it up, if you're sick of Pizza Pizza, or other big named pizza chains, give this place a try, I'm sure you won't regret it! Let me know! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing!   I'm not sure why there aren't many reviews on here it's possible it's new. But just google it and you'll see many reviews from Just Eat.   This is a great little spot. We ordered pick up for the first time today and will definitely be ordering from here again.   The order time was quick (15mins), the prices were fantastic, and the quality of the food itself was outstanding.  You can get the full menu on the Just Eat site. We ordered the Manager's Special $17.99 large pizza, 4 pieces of garlic bread, and two drinks. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Tried this place hoping to trump my husband's preferred chain pizza place(that I hate). Success. The pizza was delicious, they didn't skimp on the cheese and it was done perfectly. The delivery was fast. Also the price is on point, very good value for money."}
{"text":"Good pizza (the crust is amazing), cheap price for the portions and toppings and never a greasy mess"}
