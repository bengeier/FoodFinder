{"text":"Quaoity and portion sizes here are very mediocre. The shish taouk didn't have much flavour and the potatoes were sort of soft and lacking a crisp texture as they had been sitting in a tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Especially for the price. Reminds me of Lebanese back in Detroit which is the best quite honestly. But in a city full of Arabic spots it's not bad"}
{"text":"I recently learned that shish taouk is Montreal-style chicken shawarma, there is also a chain of restaurants bearing this name that should be avoided.  The term shish taouk in relation to chicken shawarma is technically inaccurate; as it is generally used to refer to Turkish style skewered chicken. However, in Montreal there is a general exception and chicken shawarma is referred to as shish taouk.  Now with this out of the way I can begin to dissect the quality of Shish-Taouk the restaurant and their chicken shawarma.

Not only is there a degree of confusion regarding nomenclature within Montreal, there is also an obvious confusion in terms of what a true quality chicken shawarma should entail. Shish-Taouk provided a lacklustre effort at best.  The pita was dry and crumbly and wasn't pressed properly, the chicken was rubbery and lacked the requisite garlicky kick that fans of shawarma crave and the pickled turnips didn't yield that satisfying umami inducing crunch that one associates with their favourite shawarma joints.

Although I would consider myself to be a relatively competent chicken shwarma aficionado, someone who can discern subtle differences between various locales, it didn't take a discerning shwarma palate to note the poor quality of the offering provided at Shish-Taouk.  I had just introduced a friend visiting from British Columbia to the wonders of the Shwarma world, and needless to say he didn't have a strong body of referential experience in which to assess the relative merits of said shwarma-yet even in the infancy of his shwarma sojourn he realized that Shish-Taouk had failed miserably to impress. 

You will find a plethora of shish taouk or chicken shwarma joints in Montreal, Shish-Taouk the restaurant should be avoided, unless the perfect storm finds you in dire circumstances at 3am, where you happen to be on Boul Saint-Laurent,  happen to be standing directly in front of said establishment, and also happen to have a desperate, uncontrollable shwarma craving and are in an alcohol induced haze.  In all other circumstances do yourself a favor and walk a few blocks either way. Avoiding the disappointment will be well worth it."}
{"text":"Staff are very nice but the food taste like nothing for the same price just go to amir it taste beter"}
{"text":"These wraps are huge! Thats the only thing I got to say about it. The wrap I had did not seem fresh. The pita tasted like its was days old! It really wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"Mediterranean style food with kabobs and shawarma. They had the beef spinning on a spick with a layer of fat dripping from the tool down. It was fairly decent. 
The pita tasted a little stale but otherwise a good experience. 
Really more a 3.5 star place."}
