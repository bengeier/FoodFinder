{"text":"The best burgers in Toronto !!!  Luv it !!! Best price !! Good poutines!! Real good shakes!!"}
{"text":"Not the best in town but not the worst. Standard burger and fries joint. Tad less greasy with vegetarian and chicken options. But when I go for a burger, I go big or go home typically.  I do the like the sweet potato fries though."}
{"text":"If you're into having your order messed up over and over again, than you're in luck! Missing egg and peameal bacon on your egg burger? Missing pickles? Missing employees when you're standing there alone for over 5 minutes waiting to order some food cause you're hungry and want to get fed? My love of burgers and gravy kept me coming back but the missing egg and bacon is just unforgivable. I can understand that mistakes happen and orders get messed up on occasion but where's the egg and bacon at? This isn't Burger King."}
{"text":"The staff are really nice and helpful in this branch. For a franchise, the burger is really good and i liked it in particular because you can customize all the toppings. There are choices for bread and size of the burger. Many choices for soft drinks and the meat is certified and traceable which is a rare thing in burger franchises."}
{"text":"There is one server/chastise here that is absolutely disgustingly rude. I refuse to come here while she is working, she rolls her eyes continuously & doesn't know anything about what you're selling including what salad dressing it used. She made a big deal over me asking what kind (and I needed to know due to allergies) if I could give negative stars I would. The owner needs to deal with their employees attitudes."}
