{"text":"The worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant/ pub ever. The food was NOT good and when we tried to voice our concern the owner had a major attitude and basically ran out us out of there yelling at us down the street off the patio. Really crazy behavior!!"}
{"text":"Love the friendly, relaxed, casual vibe. Good beers on tap and plenty of food options for everyone including vegan options. Service is always very good.  Kid friendly and they even have a kids menu. I will come back again and again."}
{"text":"this place is a solid, dependable local, with friendly service, good bar food, a nice patio, a mixed crowd, and a pleasant all-around atmosphere"}
{"text":"I like this place and the owner is very nice-  Love the outdoor patio- the food is good and fresh. The chicken wings are pretty good. The place is fairly priced as well."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have not received consistent high-quality food from this place, and as such my rating reflects the average experience.  The cost, which is on par with many other bars (but perhaps overpriced for the area) means I don't expect anything out of the ordinary. This has a limit however, so when my \"side of fruit\" consisted of an orange slice, and my steak was a mere fraction of what was described on the menu I was very disappointed.  Seems like the kitchen needs to step up their game.  I may go back for a drinks-only experience, but they've been written off for food."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this bar a few years back and we are glad we did. Although the menu is limited, they have a wide enough selection and the multiple times we have come here have always enjoyed the food. The owner is a nice guy with a no BS attitude, who helps wait the tables. You can tell he is not just an owner, he does it because he loves it. Great selection of local beers on tap, a lot of variety, but none of the big names. Of the 2 1/2 years of being patrons we have never left dissatisfied. The only complaint I have is that they took my favourite dish off the menu :(."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have known the owners for a long time and encouraged them to open this location.   Boo Radleys is what a real \"local\" used to be; friendly, affordable, and social. Boo's succeeds on all 3 counts providing a space that is flexible for your style; booths, tables, bar, and patio (plus darts). Since opening a few years ago Boo's is helping revive what was a dead part of Dupont and creating a scene that is eclectic and very much in the spirit of Junction Triangle. Its not unusual to see local groups having meetings, politico's dropping by, families, and the after work crowd. Named after the character in To Kill A Mockingbird, Boo Radley's is a homespun local in a sea of chains and gastro lounge whatevers.  The menu is pub, but good pub with enough twists that everybody can find something they like. The home made meat pies are great, any salmon dish is good, and the rib wings special is one of my faves. My wife likes the fried chicken. I have never had a bad meal at Boo's."}
{"text":"Neighbourhood bar run by master bartender Michael, who used to work at Betty's on King St East."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. It's a shame; I love coming here for drinks on the patio when it's nice and warm out. However, the food was diabolical.  I had the steak sandwich. It tasted nice, but I was disappointed with the portion size. For $12, it should have been much larger. My girlfriend barely had a few mouthfuls of her meal before I finished my sandwich in no more than eight bites. What I was left with was a sad-looking salad, a dish that was two pieces of cucumber, two slices of tomato, and the rest -- a bowl of day-old lettuce.  As for my girlfriend's meal, she opted for the 10oz AAA steak, with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad. While her portion size was much more reasonable for the $16 price tag, the quality of the food made it worth no more than $10. The steak was a flabby, half fat, poor excuse for a piece of of meat that is edible for humans. She spent most of her time attempting to sever the fat from it -- fat that looked like it had belonged in the arteries of a heavy-duty fast-food lovin' smoker, not on her meal. Her mashed potatoes were horribly salty, not properly mashed, and the Caesar salad consisted of mopey looking lettuce, burnt bacon bits, and soggy croutons.  To top it all off there was no chocolate cake to satisfy our need for something that didn't leave a horrible taste in my mouth. This is after being told they had chocolate cake. Not pleased. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"I like Boo's, primarily, because it is right next door to my house. Seriously, the attached pic is of the view from my living room picture window - that brick building is Boo's.   Boo's is cool though. Mike, the owner is an amazing guy, with lots of stories to tell, real talkative and welcoming. I've gone there for family meals, as well as night caps. Their patio is the gem of the Junction Triangle, lots of seating and a big ol tree growing up through the middle of it. Sports on the screens, a dart board, pool table and a pinball machine or two. This place is a worthy and gracious local, and, being that they're my neighbour, pretty good about lending me a cup of sugar or a bulb of garlic here and there."}
{"text":"I live in the area and had been meaning to check out this little bar/restaurant.  Came here last Monday (during the long weekend) and was surprised it was busier than I would have thought - patio was almost full.  We managed to grab a small table on the patio.  The menu has typical bar type food.  I had the fish & chips and my fiance had the buffalo chicken sandwich - both were really good and came out super fast.  Service was also super friendly.  This is a great casual place to come with your friends for a bite and some drinks.  I'll def be back."}
{"text":"Plan A was to come for drinks after a stressed workday with la famille (3 of us), chill, then cross the street for dinner at Piri-Piri. The deck was full. Inside there was a party with a lot of small kids who were very very loud--just not what I needed. Asked for a table outside when available and both servers kept an eye out for the next one to become free. Much appreciated.  Once we relocated outside, it was perfect. They have lovely craft beer on tap and the sight of the food going by was just too tempting. Invoke Plan B, i.e stay here. We ordered a beef risotto on special, the Boo's salad and the Longhorn salad. A nasty thunderstorm came in and we changed to a table with an umbrella (while everyone else went in), meanwhile the staff kept asking if we wanted to come in, and they prepared a space. Finally we did and my son had desert, a home-made caremel-cocnut cake with ice cream that was lovely.  Food was very good for a bar, atmosphere was easy going, staff was wonderful, beers were terrific. What more could one want?"}
{"text":"i t had been a few years since my last visit- was really wanting a cheap but tasty burger and a side - I wasn't sure from the reviews ....... They however had three great sounding specials on- one pasta - one pan fried fish - and a Guinness Stew. - all $10 I opted for the stew- It arrived  piping Hot - Lots of tender meat- stayed hot and was sided with a small  loaf of Garlic Bread - Perfect.   The owner is always super friendly - the bartender waiter also very pleasant-  Not a fan of any television- but found a spot away from the sight and sound of the TV-  A good soundtrack played nearby - enjoyed my meal \" the Grid and the Star.\"   Would definitely go back for the specials - You  can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Went here on Sat night for a late dinner and drinks.  This place was clean and the server was very nice.  The food was pretty good (no gourmet awards to be won but wings, pizza, wraps... all tasty).  Atmosphere was relaxed and the crowd was good.  Prices are reasonable - this could be a contender for my new local hangout."}
{"text":"It was overall a good experience I ordered the steak sandwich which comes will fries the bread was fine but to much arugula the steak was decent I got it medium well as little chewy but fine. Not enough cheese the fries were just average nothing special. They have a large variety of beers they have one brand of alcohol free beer it's just average grocery store stuff. It has a great vibe the dart board is nice different from all the other bars with pool tables it's a good place to go with freinds to watch a sports game."}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers after rock climbing next door.  We had a wonderful time with drinks and dinner at their patio.  I had the shrimp sandwich (not sure what it was called on the menu). It was lightly fried and very delicious, the bun was a but dense though I might add.  The fries were freshly fried and crispy."}
{"text":"So each time I come here I like it more .. The beer is the best section of craft brew.. In the area also is a laid back place to hang out  Free wifi food is good and the staff are friendly ..how could I forget the patio is awsome"}
{"text":"Decent spot really close to the old homestead. Beers seemed decent with lots of craft beers on tap. Service was also friendly.   Only downside was my girlfriend had the nachos and the portion was quite small."}
{"text":"I've wanted to go to this place forever since I live at the buildings just down the way and finally got to!  Server was wonderful. Very sweet and courteous.  Patio is really cramped but charmingly so. Entrance is around the side. Small indoor space too.   Ordered the Candy Cane Beet Salad (candied beets, spinach and strawberry vinaigrette) to start. I'm not one for beets but found this alright. The portion was HUGE but definitely not enough dressing. Easily solved by asking for more.   Mains: Grilled chicken and Brie, fries on the side.  Chicken was VERY blackened which is not my preference so that kind of ruined it for me right off the bat. I couldn't even really taste the Brie... They also put the same salad that was in the starter salad which wasn't a good match for it - too bitter. Maybe sprouts would have been a better choice.   Partner ordered steak and sweet potato fries and was pleased with both."}
{"text":"Boo's has quickly become our new local since settling in the lower junction triangle. It is a great local pub, with a winning patio in the summer and cozy atmosphere in the fall. Last night we went because I was too lazy to cook and it was the best decision I've made all week.  I had the $12 steak sandwich with mushrooms and onions--it was fantastic! The steak cooked to a perfect medium rare (served with a side salad)-I want to eat it again right now. My partner had the chicken sandwich & fries ($10) which was pretty decent but nothing to rave about.  A pitcher of Beaus goes for $18 and they have lots of other beer options if that's not your brew of choice. Great and friendly service (& an invite to their upcoming Halloween party)!"}
{"text":"The Hubster and I came here for a casual dinner and drinks last night and were quite pleased. For one thing, we both got what we were craving foodwise (he a burger, me prime rib, their Sunday special! $14.95 WHAAAATTT?!) They also had some good choices of craft beer.   Service was very friendly and the atmosphere was comfortable. The Hubster ate his entire burger and fries in a couple minutes, and I enjoyed my prime rib a little more slowly. Both were great, and I loved the fries. The meals weren't fine dining standard, but they were filling, very tasty and the price was right. They were a bit better than most pub food.  When we left, we were formulating the best way to return without a car, so we could properly enjoy the place, particularly during patio season.  Note, cash and debit only!"}
{"text":"Sad to say our last experience at Boo's wasn't great. Everything appeared fine... we order the fish and chips, and two pints. My Henderson's amber tasted flat - I took two sips and left it. The fish and chips were okay (crispy yet super oil slick oily) and the fries weren't bad.  Beware the tartar sauce and/or slaw!  Also- one of the waitresses reeeeeeked like an old ashtray (not great when you're serving food).  We do not live far so, we walked home. About 15 minutes in from being home and I am sick as hell! Pretty much all night spent in the bathroom. Thanks.   While we -might- return if desperate to grab a pint in our neighbourhood (doubtful) there's a new resto opened across from Boo's that looks like it's serving wood fire cooked pizzas and local craft beers plus, Farmhouse Tavern down the street.   Boo, check your servers and refrigeration!  The neighbourhood is gentrifying fast."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite with the fam.  Some decent beer selections, great and cozy layout.  Food is little on the pricey side but it's good.  I recommend not getting the burgers etc but try some of their specialties like the Moroccan acorn and their other specials.  Kid friendly and the staff is very nice.  I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"My roommate and I recently moved to the neighbourhood after being gentrified out of our beloved Parkdale, so we needed a new local. Boo Radley's ended up winning out.  The beer on tap selection is very good and includes Beau's. Mmm. Beau's is a \"lagered ale\" brewed in Vankleek Hill, the tiny Ottawa Valley town that I thought was the most boring place ever when I visited family there growing up but which apparently is now a foodie destination. Beau's is tough to find on tap. The taps change from time to time but always include one or 2 interesting beers and well as the popular standards.  The daily food specials are a great deal, and while the food is pub food that won't be mistaken for haute cuisine, it's really very good pub food. The Sunday roast with pudding and gravy is perfect comfort food, and the burgers and fries are fresh, cooked as you like them, and tasty. The kitchen is open late and you can get fries and wings until closing.  The atmosphere inside is cozy, though it's been chilly through the winter. Michael, the bartender, is friendly and helpful. Boo's is a great neighbourhood spot to have a chat or watch the game over a good pint."}
{"text":"good place. we came in as a big group so its nice tht they could cater us. however, service was really slow. it literally took them an hour. more than an hour to give us our food. one waiter for 20 ppl. food was ok. not good. burger patties were all burnt."}
{"text":"I would've given this place four stars based on their food because I was super impressed with their steak salad but I found the service was half ass. Our waiter made it feel like it was so much effort for him to tell us what was on tap and he just wasn't all that enjoyable. Maybe he had a bad day but it reflected on us sticking around for more pints. We ate. We had a pint. We left."}
{"text":"When I had first moved to the Junction Triangle, there weren't too many places to hang, especially on the west end of Dupont. Boo Radley's Junction Bar and Grill is a good alternative to the (seemingly) dingy bars/sport cafes that make up Symington and Dupont. The first time I stepped into this place, the owner greeted me and welcomed me to the neighbourhood (I had told him I just moved in.) Food and drinks are decently priced and the place has cozy booths, so it makes a great place for a date or a hangout. The last time I was there, my friend and I shared a pizza for $14. If you're looking for a place to have dinner and hang out and you don't want to spend the money that Farmhouse Tavern requires, Boo Radley's is a great place to go."}
{"text":"I am only taking away a couple of stars for the lack of veggie options and the price points being a bit high for what you get. However, Boo Radley's selection of beers, friendly service, and delicious fries and pizzas make it a great spot in a neighbourhood with few sit-down dining options."}
{"text":"We were starving, wanting to try somewhere new on our route across town. Looked this place up, saw a sign out front  that said \"We Have What You Need\" I figured that was a sign, so we decided to check it out. Unfortunately we spent 10 minutes driving around the block and up side streets, trying to find parking (finally ended up parking on Dupont) and then the entrance isn't off of Dupont (where the sidewalk sign was). So we're starving and super frustrated at this point..finally found the entrance because of the little sign showing us we were in the right place (on the side street next to what looks like a back door). We went in and our server was super friendly, said we could sit inside or out (they have a nice raised deck patio with lots of table umbrellas), but we decided inside where it was cool. I ordered the wings - half jerk and half honey n garlic, he ordered the steak sandwich and caesar salad. I'm not a huge french fry person but THESE are fantastic, thin cut, skin on, perfectly cooked - YAY! I also asked for a side of gravy which made the french fry experience extra lovely. The server had mentioned that the Jerk was spicy (I can do spicy), but she didn't mention that they were \"too hot to taste and make you wanna cry\" spicy. She was super apologetic and I made it work by drenching them in the blue cheese dressing, they were flavourful but I would order something a little less mouth burning next time. Not a huge deal. The steak sandwich was excellent! Thick enough that they ask you how you'd like it done. Unfortunately the caeser salad was just a step up from a bland chain restaurant version - it would be great if they actually upped it a notch, would make it a well-balanced meal (to match the greatness of the steak sandwich). I would come back for dinner (this was lunch time) and try out their roast beef. Overall a good pub experience!"}
{"text":"Boo Radley's is our favourite new neighbourhood place!  Decent menu, nice people and atmosphere!  Too bad it took us this long to get here but we're hooked now :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a quiet saturday at around 10pm and the place had a decent amount of people for being in the middle of nowhere.   I got the burger, which was pretty average (ingredients tasted fresh enough, and bun was soft, patty was very well done though and not super juicy). My friend got the chicken and brie sandwhich (he asked for pear jam on the side, but it came on the sandwich...it taste good, and the server asked if we were okay with it a couple of minutes later when she checked up on us and realized the mistake). The best part were the shoestring fries...Freshly fried, salted to perfection with little bits of potato skin still on them so they felt like real potato fries.   It's got a very laid back mellow vibe, think dive bar, mixed with local tavern. Our water was super friendly, and apparently the menu is being updated, so I think I'll be heading back to try the new stuff when it's out."}
{"text":"This is my local and I'm always happy to grab a drink and enjoy the atmosphere here.  There are dart boards if you feel like challenging your friends, a great patio (when the weather co-operates) and decent snacks."}
{"text":"Good beer list. Cheap and cheerful local hangout. Menu is pretty basic, burgers, wings, a few salads... Typical pub food but always pretty good. Don't recommend the hot wings, they taste more like ketchup than anything. Everything else has been good... Staff are nice and attentive..."}
{"text":"After striking out for a table at Playa Cabana Cantina on a Wednesday night without reservations, we decided to head to Boo Radley's.  Plenty of seating available at this local tucked away eatery.  We ordered: 3lbs of hot wings with fries to share ($28) and 1-piece fish & chips ($10), plus an assortment of pints ($7.50).    Wings arrive at the table hot and fresh from the deep fryer.  The pungent scent of hot wings was too good to ignore!  Fish and chips were good as well (it's really hard to screw up this dish but I've had really bad ones before).     Friendly service, decent craft brew selection and solid food offerings makes Boo Radleys one of our favourite go-to spots in the West end."}
{"text":"Nice little place to visit if you're in the Junction.  Good food compared to other bars.  Every time I've been in, its been really quiet. Its sort of nice that way though.  The deck is nice to sit on in the summer.  The bartender is a really nice guy. And the beer selection is really great.  Definitely go check this place out if you're nearby."}
{"text":"I like coming here on a nice summer night to chill and drink on their patio. Service was good but haven't tried their food. This place had good vibes for me. Friends have told me that it's sketchy but people there the night I was were all working professionals just looking to hang out and relax."}
{"text":"Great pub, awesome patio, and solid menu. Fiance and I came here on a summer Sunday afternoon for a few on their beautiful patio. Boo Radley's knows what it is: a local. And unlike a lot of bars and pubs that have jumped on the gastro-whatever wagon, its menu sticks to simple meals that are executed well.   Good beer selection, with ciders and cocktails rounding out the beverage selections. Our waitress also served us up some nice and spicy Caesars for our second round, and the steak salad I had was perfectly cooked and tasty. The service was prompt and very personable--we were never left waiting for anything. This is an unassuming, affable place to grab some drinks and chill out in the west end."}
{"text":"Good brunch, fast and friendly service.  Cozy neighbourhood spot.  Large portion for brunch."}
{"text":"OK, so JYB and I have been here a number of times over the past year, but I feel it needs to be reviewed now. This particularly occasion was Boxing Day and we were the first customers of the day around 3ish. On to the food, JYB gets the steak and arugula salad every time, and for the price you cannot beat the quality of the meat, the salad itself is well garnished and the meat is always cooked to perfection (JYB does med rare). I change it up every time, this time was a cheeseburger. Now, I love burgers and to be fair, I prefer more of a greasy, american cheese covered, mid rare burger, like at parts and labour BUT this burg brought me back to bbq's as a child. Fresh patty, cooked nicely with melted mozza, a fluffy bun, dill pickle slices with a salty bite and fresh garnish. Overall, the place is on point, great service, quality food and drink at a fair price. Enjoy!!"}
