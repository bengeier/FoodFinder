{"text":"Alright, I've decided to end my Yelp leeching with this review. Let me start by saying I'm from Sichuan. I was born and raised there. I didn't come to Canada till I was 11 and continue to visit every year or two. Sichuan is located in the central to southern part of China, certainly NOT northern. China is a big country with thousands of years of history. So every region has evolved to develop its own unique taste. With that said, Sichuan cuisine is completely different from northern cuisine or Cantonese cuisine, which dominates the Toronto market. It's unfair to draw your conclusion on the authenticity of a Sichuan restaurant if you've never been there, lived there, or had proper introduction by a local. So I think it's important to keep that in mind when you're reviewing the authenticity of any restaurant.

Tian Fu, now back to being called Ba Shu, is authentic. When I first moved to Ontario, I was on a mission to find the best and most authentic Sichuan restaurant in Toronto. It was a huge challenge because it appears every second restaurant prides itself on serving \"authentic\" Sichuan. Eventually I did find all the authentic ones and decided Ba Shu was the best among them. So for the past 6 years, I've been going here every time I'm in town.

However, for the last 2 times, I've noticed some changes. The food is not as spicy and numbing, making the taste more bland than usual. The portion sizes are smaller. And on top, the price has gradually increased over the years, which I never complained about because honestly, I'd pay any price for authenticity away from home. But the quality no longer appears to match that price. This makes me extremely sad. From my understanding, the restaurant has changed ownership at least once but I still see a couple of familiar faces in the kitchen. I don't know if they're the chiefs but if they are, I feel perhaps they're being pressured to dial down the spice level to cater more to the general population. This is just my assumption though.

I'm giving this restaurant a 4-star because:

1) The taste is still authentic despite the changes I mentioned above.
2) Some previous reviews are highly inaccurate and unfair in my opinion. I think this restaurant deserves more credit.

However, I will venture out next time and give the other Sichuan restaurants another try."}
{"text":"Price / Quality Ratio = 20 %
1. Long Waiting Time for food especially seafood dishes even there are not much customer in the restaurant
2. Way too spicy even they said \"1 chilli\" (i.e. Less spice) I'm able to handle pretty spicy food but this is just like OOM.....

Suggestion: \"No Offence\" Base on some other yelper and my personal experience. I would recommend to go to Finch / Midland or first markham pace if you want to eat similar food. Way more delicious and clean."}
{"text":"Get some spice in your life. This place g8es you the numbing heat in Sichuan cooking. If you dont like to see a pile of Chili or pepper, they also have other non-heat options available.  Ordered spicy fish in a stew, and it was littered with crack peppercorn"}
{"text":"I think that this is one of the most authentic szechuan restaurant in Toronto. Since I was there last time the place was renovated ,has a new menu and a new name. The food is spicy and very tasty."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place with my friends after spending almost half an hour deciding on what to eat. Despite not knowing much Mandarin, actually close to none, we ordered a few dishes that tasted delicious! 

The servers were very helpful in guiding us with what to order, and they were very attentive to serve you. The owner dropped by our table a few times to serve us as well, but unfortunately we were unable to understand what she was trying to ask us. Most of the time we were just exchanging smiles to each other. 

We ordered a stir-fry beef dish, fried rice, and an eggplant dish. (I apologize for not knowing the exact names, but we basically ordered whatever pictures were provided on the menu LOLZ) The presentation of the fried rice was very cute, it came in a little barrel with a lid on top. And it was the dish that caught my eye the most. Overall, every dish was flavourful and I was obsessed with the eggplants."}
{"text":"There's a worm inside the veg dish. They offer to take off the bill and remake. On top the manager offered free dessert. When the bill came, the dish wasn't taken off and he argued he said the word take it off the bill OR remake. and he said he has given a free dessert already. If it wasn't for the special 5.99 Szechuan style fish I wouldn't come here. It take them so long to fish for the fish dish. Dinner was already done and we had to sat and wait."}
{"text":"My girlfriend read that you lose more weight on a spicy diet, I can confirm that we did weight any less leaving here than when we came in. The food was so spicy I just couldn't take it but she had a great time probably from watching my face! She wants to go back! I said okay with me, just go with her girlfriends and not me!"}
{"text":"I love going to Chinese restaurants, 
despite most of the time the decor looks like a super shabby downtown house that has been rented for the past 10 years. I never minded that. However, that being said I've always wanted to bring friends and family to these restaurants for special occasions because who doesn't love good food?? Finally, I can add Tian fu/Bashu to that list. 

Love the new decor compared to the old one. There's also a new selection of food on the menu which adds to the previous one but the old favorites are still there. One of the more authentic sishuan restaurants I've been to. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Sichuan restaurant! Never got disappointed. Perfect place for people who love spicy food."}
{"text":"Extremely slow. We waited one hour between our first dish and second dish, and the second dish was an egg drop soup, which takes me 10 minutes to make at home. The time for the entire meal to arrive, from when the first dish arrived to when the last dish arrived (we ordered 3 dishes and one soup), took 2 hours. We did not order any complicated dishes either, they were all common ordinary dishes such as shredded pork with green peppers. Our last dish, garlic stir-fried bok choy, took so long to arrive that my dad just told the waitress to cancel that dish if they haven't started on it yet. Lo and behold, that dish came in 10 minutes after my dad gave his cancellation request...

The dishes were mostly overcooked but still good, but due to the ridiculous wait times, we won't be coming back.

The owner is rude too. And nowhere to be found when we tried to speak with her during our meal about the long wait times. Turns out she was drinking and chilling with her friends in the private dining room, rather than overlooking the restaurant operations or monitoring/assisting the kitchen staff, considering so many the customers are waiting for their dishes and have been waiting for a long time like us. The owner clearly doesn't care about her business."}
{"text":"One of the better places around to grab some Chinese sichuan style cuisine. Compared to a lot of other restaurants, this one feels much more authentic. After getting the new look and menu, eating here has become much more enjoyable than before"}
{"text":"Tian Fu Restaurant ????is a rebranding of the old Bashu/Red Chili ????. 

Brand new deco which is so much more functional with the addition of booth seating for smaller groups. I like how they now use real table cloth instead of plastic. Everything here is just so much classier!

Menu has the usual Northern Chinese selection. Tian Fu is serving the real authuentic Chongqing ?? and Szuchaun ?? cuisine. But be warned that when they says is spicy, it is really that spicy. Be prepared! 

They do have a lunch menu with a good selection of rice dishes for $7.50.  

Beef with Noodle in Spicy Broth ($7.99) ?????? is good and spicy. Made my lips went numb and my eyes watery, the way I like it! I think this is the most spicy broth I ever ate in GTA.

Of course there are other non spicy items to choose from. But I would stay with the hot spicy stuff!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that the food was not at all spicy.  It's just salty. When it was under the name Bashu, the food was more authentic."}
