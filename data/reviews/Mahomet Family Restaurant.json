{"text":"Decent family place- good values, as there are plenty of options to make all happy.  Noting is going to impress you, but the opposite is true as well."}
{"text":"Seems like a new place. Extremely attentive serving staff. The menu is a pricey for what you get, 5.99 for the kids menu got us one pancake, a piece of bacon and a drink. I'm allergic to eggs and ordered my breakfast without, but they wouldn't substitute anything. However the portions were large enough that I was satisfied anyway.   We thought the breakfast food was greasy but the menu was broad enough. Nothing super special but a standard staple small town diner,"}
{"text":"For a relatively small town, the Mahomet Family Restaurant has laudable big city qualities!  The menu is extensive and diverse, they do have specials, the desserts are spectacular, and for you late risers, breakfast is served all day. The food is skillfully prepared and presented, the service fast, efficient and attentive, and the prices represent excellent value.  This family owned restaurant is clean, comfy and consistent.  The building is spacious (although it can fill up because of popularity with locals) with dedicated parking including handicapped accessible immediately out front.  It is easy to locate right off Route 150 -  just west of the new library and primary school and is on the south side of the road - look for the sign."}
{"text":"Great environment, great food. Beware! The serving sizes are quite large, so eat what you can order. I ordered the omelette and it came with hash browns and two butter sandwiches! All of it was great. The fried chicken was delicious too. I definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"If it's all that's open at lunch, you don't have to go hungry but you probably won't go back either.  The building is new,  the location is great and I am told they have a great breakfast,  that is why this is about my experience at lunch.  There were 4 sets of silverware brought to that table during the course of this 2 person lunch, only 1 was clean. Be careful to inspect yours.  The food you can likely buy at a warehouse store. Nothing was fresh, all frozen. Do Not get the fish and chips. The fish is obviously a factory prepared Long John Silvers knockoff has little taste. I added salt, pepper, lemon, hot sauce just to find some to bring it to life. The potatoes were something I had never heard of before and I won't eat again. On these as well,  more table seasonings.  Just expect marginal service, below average food at a realistic price but poor value for what was provided"}
{"text":"Our family place for breakfast!  Quick service with a smile and delicious food.  Very clean, inexpensive and great staff!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly new restaurant. Definitely glad to have more then one option to go eat. It is a clean place and the service was good.  Not over the top but good. The quality of the food has a lot to be desired. I got chicken strips and mpg. Thought I was at McDonald's. The strips were not real chicken meat. Just a long nugget. When u pay $8 for dinner u would like it to be not chicken nuggets. The mpg wasn't hot had to send back to be reheated.  Husband had a chicken sandwich. Not bad for chicken sandwich. People need to realize that they can charge higher prices if the quantity and the quality is good. No one wants to pay for crap. They want to leave feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for a few months now. They are a relatively new restaurant & at first I had a hard time steering away from the usual local place, the Hen House. But once I tried the breakfast here at the Mahomet Family Restaurant, I was hooked. Perfectly made every time & not overloaded with grease. I haven't tried anything other than breakfast but I hear it's good. The servers are always on point & friendly as well. Definitely a place to try in small town Mahomet."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly service and good food. Breakfast served all day. I highly recommend the Steak sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"We came with a large group - probably 35+ - for Friday night dinner. We had a private room which was small - made it difficult for our waitress to serve, but we were able to help pass things to the ends of the long tables. One waitress serving such a big group is tough, but she did her best, kept her cool, and made everything right for us. The food was a very pleasant surprise - esp after some negative reviews we'd read. I heard high praise for chicken parmigian, stir fry, and catfish and the all you can eat walleye was some of the best we've ever had - light batter and not greasy at all. Would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. And I mean TERRIBLE. Nothing is fresh. Everything is frozen. My daughter ordered fish and chips and the fish had some disgusting yellow substance under the breading. We brought it to the owners attention and she told us to \"Come back on Friday. We have real fish on Friday\" Seriously?? Gross. My son had a burger. Clearly a frozen burger patty. I'm also pretty sure this place got shut down by the health department a few months back for having food at unsafe temperatures. I won't be back on Friday or any other day."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend's family for Christmas Eve dinner. The place looks like your typical classic diner, clean and cozy with carpeted floors.   The service was good, fast and friendly, except when the guy blatantly said he didn't remember all the types of toast they had.  I ordered the veal Parmesan, with potato soup which came with it as an appetizer. The best part of the meal was the speed with which everything arrived, which was extremely prompt. However, this seemed to come as a sacrifice to the quality. The spaghetti was decidedly average, even with a load of grated Parmesan on top. The breaded veal was good but it isn't easy to go wrong with fried meat. The garlic toast was fine. Taste-wise, the soup was probably the best part, and even that wasn't as hot as it might have been.  My girlfriend specifically stated her fish sandwich was \"the most boring sandwich she'd ever had.\" I also ended up finishing her sister's chicken stir fry, which was also just average. Lastly, we had chocolate mint cake as dessert, which wasn't great either. Typically, as far as serving sizes go, whenever I eat out anywhere, I'll be full and satisfied by the end of my meal without ever wanting dessert, but this time I didn't feel full even after it.  The check came handwritten and the manager came to ask us about the meal, which were nice touches. Otherwise, this place falls short of recommendation."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and house made chicken strips were very good and waiter recommended. We would come back to have that again for sure. Mushroom Swiss burger was one of the better burgers in C/U area. We thought the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, very attentive servers.   Will definitely be back.  We had the Sunrise Chicken sandwich and turkey club, both were very good."}
{"text":"For a small town diner, it is consistently good.  The staff know the menu and are very pleasant and respectful.  The food is great, some dishes are better than others, find the ones that suit you.   It is nice to have these options in town.  For those who bashed the fish, why would you get fish?   I would wonder where you get awesome fresh fish in the Champaign area, and don't say Red Lobster........"}
{"text":"By the name you can guess this is not a chain and one never quite knows what to expect under those circumstances but this was a really good find. The restaurant is on a strip mall just off highway 150.   It's got a wall of windows which makes it bright and welcoming. The place is spotless. The furniture (chairs and booths) is comfortable. The place was quiet enough to have a conversation.   The menu includes all-day breakfast, lunch sandwiches and wraps, and dinner entrees.   There is a good variety of sandwiches from which to choose. There is even a senior citizens menu if you feel like admitting you are over 65.   All in all it was a very pleasant place for lunch and worth visiting again."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my son and my grandsons for his birthday total order was $ 66.00 , my grandsons had pancakes that they liked and split biscuits and gravy that they didn't like, I tasted it and didn't care for it either, I had a skillet dish that consisted of corned beef , hash browns with grilled onions and green peppers and what was supposed to be American cheese but tasted very cheap version of it, topped with 2 Sunny side up eggs along with Rye toast.  It was just an OK meal on a small plate to make it look like a large portion. We all decided that for his next birthday breakfast we will go back to Original Pancake House where the same meal comes on 2 different places and cost the same . And by the way I had a upset stomach for most"}
{"text":"Oh boy. On our way from Madison to Nashville for the holidays, we stopped here out of desperation. Needless to say, Yelp led us astray. Our server was nice and attentive, but when we got our food, my English muffin had a large spot of mold on both sides. When I pointed it out to the OWNER, she said nothing, took it away, and totally different server brought me another English muffin 10 minutes later. There were also eggshells in my omelette. Yeah. When my husband paid the bill, nothing was comped, no apology was made, but she was sure to say, regarding the moldy English muffin, that \"it happens,\" and that \"it must be the bakery.\" My kids didn't even eat their pancakes. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"This is now our favorite restaurant! Very friendly staff, great food with good portion size, and reasonable prices. So far we love the Rib eye steak and eggs, the Stir fry, and the beefsteak sandwich. Also love the desserts especially the pumpkin cheesecake and Red cake."}
