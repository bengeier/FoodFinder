{"text":"Who knew we'd find a gluten free delight the whole family would love? We visited CdM for breakfast and lunch several days during our trip. The crepes were packed full with delicious finds from the neighboring market. For instance my veggie crepe came with asparagus, peas, spinach, red-ripe tomatoes, and sprouts. The chef was able to make a crepe that my picky son devoured. A return trip to Montreal would mean making this the centerpiece of our trip."}
{"text":"Halte agréable pour des galettes variées et fraîches. Bonne surprise avant de faire son marché ou après au cur du marché Jean Talon"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe the wait I had at this place. It took more than 30 mins, and it's more like a take out place so I don't think it's acceptable. I wish I could say that the crepe was worth he wait, but it really wasn't. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Le Creperie du Marche has a lot of options, including sweet and savoury, meaty and vegan. I went sweet for a crepe stuffed with chocolate, bananas, and local strawberries. The strawberries were tasty, but ultimately the crepe needed a sprinkle of sea salt or anything else that could make it less one note. I wanted to love it, but I just kind of liked it."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced for what it was. The menu was large with some innovative items, ranging from breakfast crepes with a sunny side up egg in the middle to the classic bananas and Nutella. Ordering is quick but the wait time can be a little long, but that's just a part of making them from scratch. They use buckwheat batter, which is a nicely flavorful option compared to the classic. There are some picnic tables in front of the stand, but they fill up quick. 

A bit of a tourist trap I think, but the food is good albeit a bit costly. Personally, I think we made a better meal of getting some local cheese, a fresh baguette, and some fruit from the market itself."}
{"text":"Really great savory crepe! Gluten free buckwheat but was much better than it looked. Must use a combination of gluten free flours to disguise buckwheat flavor. Had with egg, spinach, delicious tomatoes, potatoes, asapargus and goat cheese and perfect amount of pepper for some spice. The best!! Jean talon is a beautiful market. I wish we had one in my town."}
{"text":"4 stars for the crêpes, 2 stars for sides. 
We ordered a \"spéciale\" (ham and cheese crepe with a side salad and a water) at CAD 12, planning to come back for another crepe after a tour of the market. It took over 20 minutes to make the crepe and the side salad was completely burnt/frozen. When I complained to them about it, they said the fridge had gone too cold during the night... Granted, this was during the heat wave, but with all the fresh produce at the market, this was quite disappointing. We did not go back for a second crepe but I would go back for a very simple one (no fresh ingredients involved) next time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Très bonne crêpe, très bon service et sain (sans gluten)! Avis simple mais tout est dit. 
Je reviendrai :)"}
{"text":"Best savory crepe I've ever had.  And the portion size was much bigger than I thought.  Food portions in Montreal are smaller than what I'm used to see in the States so I was surprised at how much food I had to finish!  I had the mushroom crepe and hubby had spinach.  The crepes are nice and thin and not soggy at all.  There were cheese in the crepe but instead of cheesy it adds a nice element to the entire crepe.

This is located right next to the Marché Jean-Talon sign when you enter through Henri-Julien Avenue.  Another great place for breakfast :)"}
{"text":"Je n'avais pas vraiment prêté attention aux signes qui indiquaient une cuisine sans gluten et tout le tralala. Résultat, une crêpe bien moins goûteuse que je ne le pensais :( déçue, mais j'imagine qu'il s'agit d'une bonne alternative pour les personnes suivant ce type de régime alimentaire. Service ok."}
{"text":"The best crepes I've ever had. They're located right in the corner of the Jean Talon Market (Marche Jean Talon), and is always super busy, because tourists and locals alike love these crepes. They make for the perfect breakfast or lunch.

Every crepe is made with organic, gluten free buckwheat flour, which is heaven for gluten free people like me, and either way, the traditional French way is to make savory crepes (gallettes) with buckwheat anyway. Their cheese is also lactose free (!!), a savior for those who are lactose intolerant.

It was so hard picking a crepe or a couple of crepes to share between the 3 of us, but we did. We got one with apples, ham, cheese and syrup and maple butter with potato, since they sounded interesting. I liked the savory one a lot more, and honestly would've probably like some other options more as well, but it was amazing regardless."}
{"text":"Located inside Marche Jean Talon, this crepe stand is a must-try! It was actually a recommendation by a friend, so I agree that I must share this with everyone, haha. The menu is pretty simple and broken down by savory, vegetarian or dessert options. 

We didn't want anything too heavy to start the day, so we shared the first option, which consisted of eggs, ham, spinach and Swiss cheese. They will ask how you like your eggs, either sunny side up or scrambled. We decided to do the sunny side up because I love that yolk porn ya know?! 

The queue will take a while, so I suggest you take a lap around the market in the meantime. Even at 10am, the wait was about 30 minutes from ordering to when we received our crepe, but it's worth it!

Hot off the griddle, the crepe was golden and crisp. Folded on three sides, we got a view of all the ingredients, including the lonely egg to the side. I was hoping there would be an even dispersion by placement or quantity, but it may be better if it was scrambled instead. Besides that oversight, the crepe was delicious and completely inhaled. 

Overall, I loved that you can watch the whole process of your crepes being made. Definitely a spot worth visiting and I highly suggest stopping by. Just be prepared to wait. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Au coeur du marché Jean Talon, cette place incarne une bonne alte pour se rassasier avant de continuer ses courses de fruits et légumes, ainsi que de produits artisanaux!
Les crèpes sont rapidement faites, mais particulèrement bonnes! L'endroit ne paye pas de mine. Il ne faut pas se focaliser sur la déco. C'est la simplicité et la qualité des produits qui l'emportent sur la valeur des chaises et des tables sur lesquelles on mange."}
{"text":"GLUTEN FREE Crepes!!!! Everything here is gluten free and is absolutely delicious. OMG best crepes of my life. My boyfriend said they didn't taste GF and I have to agree with him. The customer service here is excellent, it's the kind of place where you make friends with the wait staff, but it's a cute little cart in the Jean Talon Market. If you are in Montreal and looking for a gluten free lunch, come here, you won't regret it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes! I always come here when I'm in Montreal. My favorite is with chestnut cream, with a close second being spinach, smoked salmon, and goat cheese. All the items are 100% gluten free for those who care, but still very tasty for those that don't."}
{"text":"En plein Marché JT de bonne crêpes... étonnant!  J'ai plus aimé les salées que sucrées.... mais elles sont toutes bonnes...."}
{"text":"This crepe place is located in Jean Talon Market but it's so good it deserves it's own review! The crepes here are just like the ones I had in Paris. They are made from 100% buckwheat flour so they are gluten free yet still manage to taste light, crispy and buttery at the same time. The savory crepes are the perfect vehicle for ham and cheese but I also love the smoked salmon filling. They are made fresh to order and the meats, veggies and cheeses all taste incredibly flavorful. Regardless of the filling I suggest you put an egg on it! They will make it sunny side up or scrambled as per your request. With regard to drinks they have fancy French Kusmi teas which I love, or you could have a cider which is the traditional drink to be had with crepes.

There is plenty of seating available and they even have a covered and heated seating area for chillier weather."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed to arrive 20 min before closing and not have full menu available.  Was told that I could only order a simple crepe.  Simple crepe was good."}
{"text":"Had a ham, cheese, mushroom and bechamel crepe. It had a buckwheat base just like the crepes in Paris. The crepe was crisp and light. The filling was generous. It was a meal in itself. Pricey as it came out to $15+ including taxes without any drink. I find the food in Montreal to be way more pricey than in Toronto."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food experience! All crepes are gluten free and they have egg free options as well. Very friendly staff and cute location. Ended up eating there two days in a row since it was the best gluten free option we found!"}
{"text":"My fiancé visited for our Montreal engagement trip. I have Celiac and I've never had a crêpe before, so I was more than excited! The location is in an eccentric farmers market. My partner talked me into the ham, cheese, egg and potato crêpe. I was going to get a dessert one since I don't really care for ham, but he said to live a little. I'm glad I listened! The crêpe was unbelievable. A perfect mixture of herbs, potatoes, lactose-free cheese, scrambled eggs and ham, which I found to be pretty dang good! Adding the maple syrup took it to another dimension. Who knew, potatoes and syrup. My partner agreed that it was an excellent way to start the day. The portion size was perfect as well, it just filled up the man. My stomachs been shrinking, so I had to leave some to my dismay. If I could have, I would have inhaled it! Five stars, a great gluten-free option! Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"Whenever I travel to a foreign country, I always hope to find those truly authentic, special dining experiences.  Crêperie du Marché in the Marché Jean-Talon did not disappoint in this respect.  For a comparable experience, think Eastern Market if you are in DC or the Ferry Building Market in San Francisco or even the new revamped French Market in New Orleans - bustling, colorful and vibrant.  

Marché Jean-Talon is a local's food market, but well worth the hike up to Little Italy.  Crêperie du Marché serves DELICIOUS gluten-free (!) buckwheat flour savory crepes and equally DELICIOUS wheat flour sweet crepes.  My traveling and dining companion ordered a savory crepe with egg, swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and semi-cooked seasoned tomatoes and spent the meal raving.  Meanwhile, I went with an apple and cheddar cheese sweet crepe (my all-time favorite) and pretty much died happy.

You can find the cute little booth housing the Crêperie tucked into a corner of the market, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled for it - you won't be disappointed in this small, cozy slice of French-Canadian cuisine."}
{"text":"Les crêpes les plus chères de la ville.
C'est un attrape touristes et c'est dommage dans ce superbe marché.

Most expensive pancakes in town.
Pity in this stunning market"}
{"text":"So yummy.  Ham, asparagus, cheese... so good.  They taste like the best-grilled cheese you've ever had!

Do yourself a favor and go to Jean-Talon Market, and get one of these crepes."}
{"text":"Located in the Marché Jean-Talon it is a stand cooking up fresh crepes with a bunch of tables to eat at.  The buckwheat crepe with mushrooms and cheese was hearty and delicious.  They also have homemade iced tea that was very good and refreshing.

A good spot to grab a crepe within the market."}
{"text":"One of the best stands at marche jean talon but it's pricey for what you get. Their best crêpe is the one with smoked salmon. Worth a try"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a rainy afternoon and it was not too busy. This place is tucked into one of the wings of the Jean Talon market. There are 6 or so tables next to the counter. The woman behind the register had such a warm and kind energy and I thoroughly believe that good kind people make the best food. I ordered the banana chocolate crepe and WOOOOO. It was phenomenal. The crepe was soft and the chocolate sauce was delicious. I need to get back there and order this again. I love this place."}
{"text":"I'm not the worlds biggest crepe fan, I'm just not. But a friend convinced me to try this little place at the Jean Talon market. 

They do something very different. They use buckwheat. I'm not sure what to make of it. It was tasty enough. I would go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good crepes, and great location. The crepes however weren't too amazing. The ingredients tasted like quality, but for the price I expected a lot better. The buckwheat flour they used though is pretty cool though."}
{"text":"I'll let you in on a little secret: I love crepes! Sweet and savory, both. I knew I would hate myself if I left Montreal (the closest I've yet to get to true Parisian culture) without trying one of each. This breakfast checked the \"Try a savory crepe\" box!

Gluten free, organic and local. The owner was very nice and chatted while we were deciding. The menu isn't huge. IMO, I like the more refined, focused  choices that were offered. They have both savory and sweet. And, don't worry, if nothing jumps out at you, there's always the option to create your own crepe. 

I picked the smoked salmon savory crepe: smoked salmon, spinach, creamy goat cheese and a fresh lemon wedge. Interesting crepe - much more crunchy than a thin pancake. Buckwheat is used in place of flour. The salmon was wonderful. And the sprouts as a garnish was so cute. Crisp and fresh. 

My mother got the traditional egg/ham/Swiss/spinach crepe. Tried a bite, and yep, also very good. 

The crepes were served pipping hot fresh off the stove. Good flavors. Great price. Giant portions. The gluten free crepe was a new addition to our tastebuds! Great spot to catch a breather, while walking the rows of market vendors."}
{"text":"This was my first time having a savory crepe - and I wasn't disappointed. I shared a vegetarian crepe with two other people as a light snack. At first, I was a little surprised by the price for ordering a single crepe - I thought it was on the pricey side, but then I saw the actual portion size and felt less bad about paying so much for a crepe. I didn't think that the vinaigrette sauce that came along with the crepe really worked with all the flavors - but other than that, I would say my experience here was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Lovely and helpful staff, good crêpes in a great market. Try their coffee, it's of good quality too, especially if you don't like the sour kind of beans they have in most montreal cafés."}
{"text":"Fast creperie inside Jean-Talon Market.

Both of the crepes we had were quite tasty. No complaints."}
{"text":"My family likes this place very much, a usual stop while at Jean Talon market."}
{"text":"They are quick and have a nice cashier whose English is very good. I was a little disappointed in the vegetarian options in the savory crepe category. I chose an apple and maple butter crepe that was good. I love that their crepes are gluten-free. Thanks."}
{"text":"They serve buckwheat gluten-free crepes. We got to Montreal early morning and stopped here for breakfast. It's a casual sit-down place right inside Jean-talon market. We got a mushroom ham and cheese one. It was good, but I'm not really into buckwheat. Too healthy for me, but my mom loved it!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????"}
{"text":"Good food. One thing to note is that their batter is all gluten-free, so they are not traditional crepes. The other downside is that it's a bit expensive. The food was good though, and the staff was friendly. We would return."}
{"text":"Gluten free Buck weed crepes ...yummmmmmm. 
Last day in Montreal and needed to get the crepe munchies done. The place is inside a market, very small, seats like 15. Only one menu and its on the sign by the cash register. Prices are decent, $7 for a caramel crepe. Good enough for 1 person but I had better in NY. Maybe is the Buck weed that I was not used to. Also if you are inside the market.. Signage is helpful Since we can't see you from the outside. 

Everyone devoured their meals and I sure did mine also. I was expecting more for the buck since we were not anywhere near any tourist spots, I guess not. Even when inside a market fruits are cheaper, pass on the savings to clients..why not?"}
{"text":"A different kind of crepe. Buckwheat flour, and a crispy finish. Kind of a cross between the classic French crepe and the Indian or Asian variety. Fantastically fresh ingredients prepared well. Not inspirational, but incredibly well executed."}
{"text":"Creperie du marche is located inside a local market and has the local touch for the ambience of it. A different kinda dinning here. A fast food type of service and they have picnic tables right in front of the counter or you sit inside the tent with few tables n chairs.

The best crepes in the world I'd say, omg they have sweet to savory crepes. We tried one veggie cheese crepe n a sweet one with the chestnut butter n berries. Both were ultimately spread n had authentic taste n texture amazing! I wish we stayed somewhere close by to this little gem."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding!!  I am glad we waited in line to be treated to such wonderful dishes. The food was made just the way we like it which is a traditional approach with an array of toppings/fillings. Be sure to try this place when your at the market.  The service will welcome you in."}
{"text":"A must when at the market here!

Crêperie du Marché is a casual joint right inside the Jean-talon market and a great choice for a bite to eat when exploring the rows of vendors selling fruits, cheese, flowers, etc.

Delicious crepes made with buckwheat flour. We loved it.

Regular, vegan, and dessert crepes to choose from. All made fresh and hot on the spot. Good prices. Plus, the portions are huge!

Picnic bench seating right on the floor of the market so you can people watch and view all the hustle and bustle. 

Do what we did. Order a few crepes, a cold drink, then go get some fresh fruit from one of the vendors and make a real nice meal of it."}
{"text":"A must on any visit to Jean-Talon Market and my favourite crepe spot in Montreal, mostly because the crepes served here feel authentically Québécois. Egg and ham, apple and maple syrup, potato and something... everything on the menu is simple, yet delicious. Plus, they do buckwheat creeps, which are gluten free! Stop by and give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Une première à la crêperie du marché pour mon copain et moi! Nous y sommes arrêtés pour le lunch aujourd'hui et avons essayé 2 crêpes repas différentes. Tout d'abord, celle au saumon fumé, épinards et mousse de fromage de chèvre. Ultra satisfaisante niveau goût et portion. Moi qui suis très gourmande, je n'ai pas été capable de finir mon assiette. Portions très généreuses de saumon et de fromage. Ensuite, la crêpe aux pommes, fromage, jambon et sirop d'érable. Un délice aussi. Les pommes très sucrées ainsi que le sirop d'érable auraient pu rendre le plat très lourd, mais le jambon et le fromage ramenaient la dose parfaite de sel à chaque bouchée. Rien à redire non plus. Fait intéressant: toutes les crêpes sont faites à base de sarrasin alors les intolérants ou allergiques ah gluten seront satisfaits. Niveau prix, il faut compter une quinzaine de dollars par crêpe repas. Pas donné, mais on ressort repus et on sent qu'on a bien mangé. Seul hic? L'emplacement! Le kiosque était situé dans une Mini section du marché Jean-Talon alors il y avait très peu de tables et c'était très cacophonique. On s'y asseoit le temps de manger, et on le fait vite. Pas très intéressant comme ambiance, plutôt stressant!"}
{"text":"We sought this creperie out because it was gluten free and we were thrilled to find it to be peanut free as well. 

It is in the Jean-Talon market. There is a parking garage which makes it easy. It is small casual place where you order at the counter. The crepes were really so delicious. The seating is a bit tight and crowded but that adds to the flair. We were so happy to find this place."}
{"text":"Hard to beat a tasty buckwheat crepe filled with just-picked veggies from the neighboring stands. Super fresh. And you can watch the eclectic collection of shoppers while you mange."}
{"text":"Their crepe for some reason looks more dark than what I've seen usually. I've tried the crepe with apple, ham, cheese, and maple syrup. The combination looks weird but it tastes so good! The flavor is very balanced. The staff there said this is one of the most popular dishes they have."}
{"text":"The cutest little place that never fails to brighten me up with its sunny, yellow sign. The crepes play a big part in that too! Found in Jean-Talon market, you can identify it as the stand with many tables smushed together. Depending on when you go during the weekend, you just might be able to squeeze in your pair or trio. You'll be very close to your neighbours - right next to them in some cases. If you don't mind the proximity and cramped atmosphere then order yourself a savoury or sweet crepe.

I personally love their savoury crepes. The buckwheat makes it super hearty and a filling meal. I split one with my husband and then explored the rest of the market for other treats to nibble on. The ingredients used are fresh and you can really taste it. The crepes are made on the side and if you creep your head up a bit you can see them working away. They have plenty of vegan options and since they use buckwheat they're gluten-free too! You can also switch out cheeses for those lactose intolerant individuals. You'd be regretting it if you didn't come here!"}
{"text":"What's the deal with gluten free crepes in Montreal.... it was hard to find non buckwheat crepes. Anyway, there were 5 of us and we shared 2 crepes - one apple, pear, and caramel and the other apple maple...  it was weird, both fruits were mashed and warm (like applesauce)... not what I was expecting. The apple/pear one was by far the better choice due to the caramel. The crepes weren't the most amazing in the world, but if you're in the area, they aren't bad."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time ever.  Had a crepe with spinach, cheese & egg.
Crepe is dark & crispier than I have seen.  Delicious treat at the great farmers' market.  
Service very courteous & helpful.  Bilingual English & French."}
{"text":"I was here YEARS ago and I still crave their crêpes!

This place is located in like a giant farmers market (which is wonderful by the way). I've always had sweet crêpes, only because I didn't know savory crêpes were a thing at the time. Don't get me wrong, a crêpe with Nutella and bananas and strawberries - I could live off that heavenly combination.

I believe the crêpe I got had ham, cheese (of course) and spinach. But it was SO yummy! It was also different than the typical crêpe that I was used to, it was crunchy!

If only I could ubereats those crêpes to California!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hated the crepe. Didn't think it was worth the money and it just tasted burnt more than anything else. Can't say I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of crepes (long story), but was convinced to try this place out.  We went for lunch and, to my surprise, had a very positive experience.  The place is small and was crowded at lunchtime, so it could be tough finding a seat during peak hours. Looking at the menu, I thought it was a bit pricey, but when the crepes were delivered to us, it turned out that they were large and substantive. 

The savory lunch crepes were reminiscent of dosas -- apparently cooked through without flipping, so they had a nice crispness.  They seemed to be made with buckwheat flour, which gave them a very nice flavor.  We tried 2 different lunch crepes - one with an egg, ham, cheese and tomato, and one with mushrooms, bechamel, ham and cheese.  They were both delicious & very satisfying.

We'd definitely go back to have them again!"}
