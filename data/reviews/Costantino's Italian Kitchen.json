{"text":"Horrible, no taste, staff completely unknowledgeable about their menu and are RUDE...13 dollars for glue white sauce four little pieces of chicken and NO garlic bread ...its SHAMEFUL!"}
{"text":"I love this food truck!  First of all, the service is fast and very friendly.  And the food is delicious!  I had spaghetti and meatballs with the spicy Arrabbiata sauce.  The sauce was amazing....very fresh and flavorful as though your grandma just made it.  I will definitely revisit this truck often."}
{"text":"The meatball sub was the worst sandwich I've ever had. Bummed I wasted my $10."}
{"text":"Ate at their food truck while they were at the Tempe Arts Festival. Pretty decent pasta and meatball sandwich- it was also nice that the breadstick and chips were also included for free as sides. Slightly disappointed that I ordered spicy red sauce on the pasta and it wasn't spicy at all, but all in all, a good experience."}
{"text":"$10 for a meatball sub (and bag of chips) that had similar taste at best as a meatball sub from Subway. Bun wasn't even toasted, although maybe I could have asked for that. I wouldn't be opposed to trying their pasta, however, with a limited menu I would think they'd strive to make all of those menu items amazing. Not the case with the meatball sub."}
{"text":"Yuck. Everything about this experience was just... yuck. I only saw the reviews AFTER I had ordered and I hoped they wouldn't apply here. Man, were they spot on. This food truck came to my office and my wife and I (we work for the same company) to give it a try. It was a complete waste of $20

I ordered the god awful meatball sub. Before handing it to me, the guy in the truck COVERED it in grated cheese. Didn't ask, just dowsed it. I am 99% sure it was to try and cover the fact the meatballs were burnt and the sauce scorched (see photo). Also, the TINY bun held 4 slightly larger meatballs. As it wasn't toasted at all, the sandwich immediately fell apart. That's when I saw just how gross the sandwich was. Heck, I even tried a bite and immediately threw it away. Not worth the $10.00 at all. I wouldn't take it if it were free.

My wife ordered the \"Penne with Sausage and Peppers\" for $9. It was supposed to come with a breadstick, which it did not. The person before us declined to wait the \"Four minutes\" until they would be ready. When our food was called, my wife was told it would be another 2-3 minutes. After she looked at hers, she found that her sausage and peppers were also burnt. It  had an acrid, singed flavor. She also threw hers away. 

To top it all off, the staff made us uncomfortable. When I went to pay, he hands my the square reader on the tip pages then proceeds to stare as I decided not to tip and signed. No thanks. Never again."}
{"text":"I had their flat bread pizza  when I was down in Phoenix this week, and it wasn't great. It wasn't even the traditional flatbread pizza either. The pizza wasn't even good. I was disappointed because it was weird tasting. I'd prefer fast-food pizza than this sadly..."}
