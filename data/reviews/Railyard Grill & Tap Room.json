{"text":"Food was above, slightly above, average bar food.  2:00 on a Monday we stop in for a late lunch and sit in the bar area where a screaming match breaks out between two guys sitting at the bar with f- bombs flying and the big fat guy wanting to go outside and fight.  I will never go back and if you do bring a gun!!"}

We thought that our first visit was a fluke. Service was VERY slow and the food took a long time to arrive.  So...we tried again today.  Mia, our server and the hostess was a lovely person and she worked pretty hard to get us seated in a quiet area. We ordered a meal but once again, our food was very slow to arrive. It was ok food, not exceptional, just ok. We asked for the check and got it but then it took a very long time for it to be picked up.  Sadly we won't try this establishment again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night.  1 server for the dining room who was also seating. Very slow service. There were maybe 4 other tables sat. It took about 10 minutes for my wife to get her wine. 
  We ordered an app of a french fries with bacon and onions. They came out quickly but cold.  My wife ordered the french dip. It was served 5 minutes or so before my food. My salad and pizza came out together.  The french dip was not edible. It was horribly fatty. We let the server know. He said they were to write down complaints. He left it there, didn't ask if she wanted anything else. Pizza was ok although considering it was $14, it was small and should of been better.

   Check came finally and i paid for the food that was too bad to eat. I was told the manager was too busy to come out to talk to us. Wow. 
  STAY AWAY.

Not sure why my profile says i am from VA lol. I live 10 minutes away from here, and would of provided them with much business."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place and read some decent reviews so I figured it was worth a shot.  Well, it wasn't.  We made reservations like the Groupon suggested.  We arrived 5 minutes before the reservation to a half empty restaurant.  No staff in sight.  Then one by one, each of 4 waitresses walked past and said \"someone will be right with you\" - some of them said this twice so we heard that about 7 times in 15 minutes.  Some of the staff exchanged irritated looks and sarcastic comments to each other as they seemingly tried to pass off the responsibility of seating us to one another.  

So then a hostess walks through with her Starbucks and walks right by us, only to come back a few minutes later and say \"someone will be right with  someone will be right with you...sure they will.  

Finally, someone greets us, confirms our reservation, and then they commence a long  hunt for menus.  He was pleasant as he seated us but then more waiting, at the table, for 10 more minutes in which we felt invisible.  Maybe we were actually because nobody, and I mean nobody that worked there so much as looked in our direction. No drink orders, no more \"someone will be right with you\"s.

We finally decided to walk out and, as we did, nobody noticed or bothered to see why we were leaving.  Another couple was leaving as we walked out, but they actually stopped a staff member to voice their displeasure - the waitress seemed totally apathetic at best.  

Thank goodness Mac N Toz was right down the street without a wait.  Totally opposite experience there, check it out.  But skip on the railyard unless, of course, you have a half hour to kill when you don't want anyone to bother to speak to you."}
{"text":"The atmosphere leaves much to be desired. The lighting is harsh and bright, does not make you want to hang out and relax. While the beer selection is extensive it is also expensive. The food looks better on the menu. I had the apple burger which had a great flavor but the construction left me eating it with a knife and fork. The brioche bun fell apart in my fingers and the patty was too big for the toppings. Also, the \"poutine\" is cheese fries with an egg. Our server was polite and enthusiastic which made me want to like this place more than I actually did. Won't be making a trip back soon. For 2 draft beers, the poutine, and 2 entrees our bill was a little over $50."}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner and drinks at 6pm on a Friday. We were seated immediately and received attentive service all night. The server Nick even brought us a sample of a specialty drink that they serve that is made locally in Upper St. Clair. I had the fish tacos with a shark fish of the day and my husband had a burger. Overall, pleased with this new local establishment and we will return. 

Recommendation to management: you have a good set up in the back for live music and this would differentiate you from other Bridgeville bars. Bring in bands :)"}
{"text":"The tacos, pretzel appitizer, and sugar cookie dessert were great. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because we were in there during off peak hours so I'm not sure how it would be in a crowded house. Great beer selection and friendly service."}
{"text":"Great place, tons of beers on tap great service and great food, can't beat that. The bar is huge and is very comfortable if your sitting at the bar, on the couches, or playing darts. I ordered the wings and they came out just the way I like it, crunchy and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Finally tried this spot this trip in.  Food was awesome, bartenders were great, bright, clean and lots of TVs.   A far cry from its previous life as Tamballinis.
Wife had the Beer, Bacon and Bourbon Mac-cheese with steak.  More than she could eat and awesome.  I had the chicken Takka Marsala.  Awesome.
Wings, jerk run, were just ok.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Railyard Grill on a Groupon.  We were a little concerned based on the reviews but we support local business and decided to give it an honest try.  We were very pleased.  The tap room is outstanding.  Huge variety of beer, ciders and mead. The food is fresh and GMO free.  We enjoyed our appetizer and meal. I did not give it a five star because I was not blown away by the food but it was very good.  Missy was our server and she was outstanding.  We even got a visit from the manager just to check in.  We were impressed and will be making a return visit."}
{"text":"Great food. Really!
Really nice staff.  
Nice beer selection 30-40 of them. 
A great find.
If you don't come here it just leaves more for us.
(Located where Tambellini's Bridgeville was. COMPLETELY REMODELED)"}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent restaurant. The food is pretty good. There was nothing that stood out in regards to the food. Pretty average and decent. However, I thought the beer selection was awesome. This is a place my wife and I enjoy meeting up with friends to have drinks and hang out. We also had a large family gathering here on a Friday a few months back, and they were extremely accommodating. A lot of places would not accommodate us because of how many people we had in our group, so we were happy that this wasn't a problem at the railyard. Overall we have had nothing but good experiences here. I only put 4 stars due to the food being average. Although I heard that menu might have changed since the last time I was there, so depending it may have potential for 5 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I were both in the restaurant industry for 15+ years so I never give a bad review. However this was the worst experience I've had in a long time. We waited for an hour for our appetizer which ended up coming at the same time as our meals. Our meals were cold and incorrect. Drink refills were not offered until we were done eating. My husband asked for fresh jalapeños on his sandwich but was told they didn't have any in house. But there were fresh jalapeños on our nachos. We asked several times for the wing sauce of the day and several times the waiter had to leave the table to find out - only to not bring the answer until the fourth try. Overall the service was awful and the food once we got it wasn't any better."}
{"text":"Beer, great! Food, terrible. Zero seasoning and taste. Poutine gravy was completely watered down. Dissapointed with the atmosphere. Skip this place and check out Industry Public house or even Insurrection brewing in Heidelberg."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Railyard Grill, the beer selection was so good it was hard to choose and the food was great.  I highly recommend trying it, you may not go back to Burg's!  I can't wait to go again and bring friends and family!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and dry rub wings. Service was very pleasant and quick. Huge beer list. I will be back here again soon."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a groupon and couldn't have had a better meal. My wife and I got the beer cheese fries and they were excellent. Portion was giant. Then we both got the Codfather fish sandwich. Definitely up there for the biggest and best fish sandwich I've ever had. Service was a little slow. Our waiter was at the bar having a conversation with someone and wasn't paying much attention to us. Had to get a greeter to get his attention to come over to give us our check. Huge selection of beers on tap and bottled specialties. Definitely would recommend this restaurant for some tasty local food, just make sure you have some time on your hands."}
{"text":"great casual dinner. spinach salad and home made dressing perfect. fish tacos great choice. try it...i'm sure you'll enjoy the evening"}
{"text":"Didn't expect to have a nice experience here. I was so pleasantly surprised when my son (not a soup eater) loved the chicken speatzle (sp?) soup! Also, was surprised and refreshed to see chicken tikka tacos with cucumber raita. The beer selection was so big and goes perfectly with the chicken tikka taco. I thought it was going to be just another sports bar. Granted there are lots of TVs which are a must have in Pittsburgh but the menu supposedly changes daily and a true thumbs up to the tikka tacos, the spaetzle soup and the thin cut fries! Waitstaff was very friendly and eager to please. Try it out."}
{"text":"Triple B Mac & cheese and pretzel bites were awesome. Big beer selection and great service. Chicken tikka tacos were extremely spicy and this was not indicated on the menu."}
{"text":"Great new place in Bridgeville.   They just opened so give them a chance to get the rhythm.  Service was great.   Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. I got wings and beer cheese fries, they were worth a try. The beer is a little pricey but good."}
{"text":"First time here! I came across The Railyard on Groupon and decided to try them out.
My boyfriend ordered a stout that he LOVED. Hints of chocolate and cherry and all that jazz. (Can you tell I'm not a beer drinker?)
We ordered beer cheese fries and poutine for appetizers. Both decent, pot roast could've used a little salt, but not bad.
My boyfriend ordered the cheesesteak sandwich and thought it was good, but his Parmesan potatoes weren't seasoned at all. I had the grilled apple burger and baked mac. The burger was fantastic! We both agreed. Definitely a winner. The candied bacon was amazing and the burger was cooked perfectly. The mac was easily forgotten. Nothing to write home about.
I'm going to be honest, I was all for giving this place 5 stars until the bathrooms.
There are 3 bathrooms (handicapped, men, women). The first door you see is the handicapped and I assumed that was the only bathroom available. It would lock, but if anyone tried the handle, it would immediately unlock. So I went into the women's bathroom. You can barely turnaround in the stall. One doesn't lock, the other didn't have toilet paper and my knees were against the door. Kudos for having a changing table in there though. As a parent, it makes life easier.
All in all, we'll come back if we're in the area, but probably not go out of our way to stop in."}
{"text":"I would say Railyard was pretty average. I drive past this restaurant every day on my way home from work, so I wanted to try their menu. My girlfriends and I started off with the nachos (minus the black beans!). We had to ask for extra cheese or salsa because our chips were pretty bare under the mound of toppings that was just on top. The cheese was different but I liked it. For my meal I had the buffalo chicken wrap and French fries. It was pretty saucy but good. My friends both had different cheeseburgers and they appeared to like them. I'm not sure if there is anything that has me dying to go back besides the fact that their Happy Hour special was till 8 PM and I got 2 Miller Lite drafts for $4."}
{"text":"Amazing service with a great sports room and a private party room. Beans are bland but if you add their special mustard dipping sauce it makes them a lot better and the mustard is really good in general it's very different and barely tastes like mustard. The fries are grade A great and the dessert skillet cookies are really cool."}
{"text":"What a great find in Bridgeville! More beers than you can shake a stick at. The menu has something for every appetite. Super friendly service. The veggie burger was fresh and full of flavor. Fish of the day was grilled delightfully. Sides were quite tasty. Everything tasted fresh, not overly seasoned. I had smashed red potatoes which had a nice Parmesan crisp on the top and bottom. Definitely coming back if we have the opportunity. TV's in both the dining area and the bar for ease of viewing games."}
{"text":"Gave it another try. Service fairly good today. Got menu and food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Definitely worth it for the garlic Parmesan french fry appetizer. Great salad and hamburger. Pot roast was iffy.  Very bland. as I understand it is based upon the type of beer they use for the gravy. Overall incredible service in credible manager. Will still come back."}
{"text":"Great option for some upscale bar fare and amazing brews!!
It's kid friendly and has amazing local sports artwork throughout!
The fries and wings are amazing. The beer selection is off the hook. Also there are the w the on tap
Beer selection throughout. 
Service is great."}
{"text":"Welp, my husband and I finally made it here tonight. Last few times it was so crowded we passed and went elsewhere. 
A friend of mine told me they would nit reccomend this place....but! Quite the opposite experience this evening for me! This place's food is BOMB. We will 100% be back. Excellent service. Amazing food. Great atmosphere. The music was a tad loud (may have just been where we were sitting) but overall i give this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say I was a bit disappointed in this place. Good beer selection on tap. We had a party of 6. We were sat at our table in 10 minutes and sat there for another 25 minutes befor we had to go to the bar and ask if we were going to get waited on . The waitress finally came over to get our order . We were at our table for an hour and a half befor our food arrived. The place was not that busy so I don't know how it could take that long to make burgers and a pizza. Food was OK. Had the spicy fire burger .You better like heat if you get this burger. Better improve fast or this place won't be around for long."}
{"text":"We had dinner on a not very busy Sunday evening...our service was slow and the food was ok and  this afternoon when I was going to have my leftovers I found a hair in my burger under the bun...needless to say I am feeling sick at this point in my day.  Not sure that we'll go back to this place again. Also the bathroom needs a MAJOR overhaul. 
The only reason I gave this one star is because I had to"}
{"text":"Place has good potential. Needs to work out some kinks. Too many fries (appetizer then loads of same come with every meal?). Good food presentation. Bottled bad dressing - such an easy thing to fix. Service manager was great. Would have been a different experience if he would not have come over to take care of us. Wait staff needs some training."}
{"text":"Positives: the beer selection is great, as were the pretzel bites.

Negatives: the servers seemed very overwhelmed and the rest of the food came out cold because of it. I was really looking forward to the poutine, but it was unfortunately pretty dry. The bathroom was dirty and didn't have toilet paper anywhere but the floor. I wanted to try the dessert and order more beer, but the server rushed me out, bringing me my check while I was still chewing. It didn't seem like it was because they were closing as they seated another group with food menus as we were leaving.

If you're coming here, just come for the beer."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection with 50 beers on tap.  Burgers were excellent and pizza was well done.  Children's chicken fingers were unique.

Wait staff was very attentive but still trying to figure out the system -- understandable given they've been open for a week.  Overall, a very good experience."}
{"text":"Obviously with a new restaurant and only being open a few weeks there will be issues to work out. 
The food is good but minimal consisting of primarily bar food. Sandwiches, pizza, burgers etc. 
We had the poutine which was very good but different than the Canadian version. 
I had pizza and the wife had a French dip sammich. 
The 50+ beers to pick from is a nice selection. 
The truffle dessert was quite rich but delicious.
A nice new restaurant in Bridgeville. Go enjoy an evening here."}
{"text":"A great experience on a chilly Saturday night.  We went for dinner and ended up staying for drinks well after happy hour.  The prices are quite reasonable and the service staff is very attentive.  I wouldn't suggest the salmon, but the chicken was good and my friend who orders Scottish egg said they were delicious!  The beer selection is just enough to give the craftsman a nice variety.  I would definitely go back a second time."}
{"text":"This place looked fun because of their craft beer selection and it did not disappoint. I ordered a green flash blonde lager after taste testing a few. The staff was very friendly and helpful!! I ordered the Mac and Cheese appetizer and it was so good! We also ordered the rail burgers which were cooked to perfection and delicious! Definitely recommend this for lunch or a fun night out! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Extremely tasty Indian influenced American.  Best wings around!  They do something odd with their meat and fish - making them all thin round circles.  Wierd.  But the flavors are spectacular.  Recommend the tikki masala tacos!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar later on a weeknight and had excellent service. All the wait staff was very friendly.

Veggie burger was very tasty, handmade not a frozen boring black bean one. They said the recipe had recently been updated. Delicious!

50 beers on tap, no doubt something for every beer drinker. I'm not a beer expert, but they seem to have some unusual offerings."}
{"text":"Railyard is Excellent!! Here visiting from Tennessee, and I highly recommend stoping by and trying their railyard burger. It was amazing!! Their fresh cut fries were cooked perfectly! The bartender was very professional and very punctual with her service. Great TV's, perfect for watching football.. the decor is great! Go check it out.."}
{"text":"We used to come to Tambellini once a week for trivia, and so we were interested to see how this brand new concept had changed the place. The atmosphere is comfortable and nicely updated. The draught list, at 50 items on draught, was impressive. And the staff was friendly, attentive, helpful, and ready to help or answer any questions we had. Most of all, the food was AMAZING. We shared theHawaiian Poke appetizer, and I had the Smoke Box BBQ burger, while my husband had the Not-a-Reuben Sandwich. We shared the Chocolate Stout Bacon Brownie to round out this delicious meal. The Railyard hasn't had their official Grand Opening yet, so we're looking forward to seeing what other wonderful things get added to their repertoire!"}
{"text":"We drive by this place all the time, and finally were able to stop. After reading some reviews we decided to try it out Friday night. Unfortunately the service was terrible. It seemed like the bartenders have no idea what's going on. The food is expensive and portions are small, which would be fine if it was any good. We tried to add a bun to the fish and chips and that was a major problem even though we offered to pay for it. The manager did stop to try and make it right but by that time, an hour later, we were ready to leave. We will NEVER goto this place again. Friday night at 9pm and the place was empty. I assume everyone has figured out this place isn't worth a second trip."}
{"text":"Not sure what all y'all is talkin' 'bout. this place is the bee's knees! definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"First with the good. Scene was good, bartenders were great and attentive. That's why I'm giving the extra star.

Now with the bad. My Pittsburgh Cheesesteak was literally the driest sandwich I've ever had. Very upsetting. Also, the plate the side salad came on.. It was small to the point I wasn't concentrating on eating it, but rather trying to keep my salad on the plate. May return for the Pens and the great service at the bar, but definitely not the food."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. Bartender was not friendly and did not know the menu well at all. The place was  disgusting dirty ewh. Floors  filthy, wine glasses deplorable smudge s all over them. Appetizer came out the plate that held the app had old food on it and was dirty. Food OK but the whole experience was horrible.would not recommend or go back. Service was
 terrible for a brand new reasturant it was so dirty everywhere. I would stead clear of this place."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was good, but overpriced.  Two medium-sized fish tacos , six homemade potato chips, and a 10 ounce draft beer should not cost $25 (that includes the tip).  The beer menu was lengthy, however there were not a lot of different types of beer.   Also, the beer menu selections were not organized by type or brewery, making it difficult to find specific varieties of beer.  We did appreciate having the opportunity to try a beer before purchasing a whole glass.  With so many similar restaurants in the area, we probably will choose another establishment when looking for a quick meal and a good beer, mostly because we didn't feel it was a good value for our dining dollars."}
{"text":"Burgers were amazing! Best beer selection in town! The manager took the time to make sure we had everything that we needed, and the service was great. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Place is 5 stars for beer. But it's a 1 star for food. Wings are okay. The rest of the food is truly shit. I've eaten here 4 times just because I like their beer selection. 

Next time I will stop at Burger King first then get a beer. 


Well I went back for a beer and they revamped the menu and kitchen priorities- food is a bit better now."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with their huge beer selection. Their menu was also extremely diverse! My salmon salad was great. And I also enjoyed the few beers that I had. Everyone else in my party also enjoyed their meals! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is a TRAINWRECK. We recently noticed this place was new to the area and thought we'd give it a try. Not a fan of their parmesan fries as an app, they were practically soggy. Then as we waited forever for our meals, we had to request the Steelers game on the TV in the dining area instead of volleyball. What restaurant/bar doesn't expect a football crowd on a Sunday?! There wasn't a hostess when we walked in and waited for someone to come over. And there still wasn't a hostess when a larger party came in and just decided to seat themselves. There's flies hanging out in the dining area. After almost an hour our food finally came and they had messed up one of our orders. Pretty unbelievable that we received tacos instead of a burger with mac and cheese. The waitress even asked how we wanted the burger cooked. Then we waited again, so long that we decided to get a to go box just to get outta there as soon as we could. Even with a second chance to get things right, they still managed to mess up and we got more soggy fries as a side when we requested mac and cheese. Although our waitress apologized and provided us with a slice of cheesecake, acknowledging her mistake, we will not be returning and don't recommend this place to anyone due to the below average food and terrible service."}
{"text":"Second review:  I have now been back a few times and service at the bar has improved.  The food is the reason I keep coming back.  I can go anywhere for bar food.  This is not that place.  The food is good and the chef is keeping things fresh.  Yes, they have pizza and wings but not traditional stuff.  Stop in and give the place a chance if you want something different."}
{"text":"The beer selection was really good and the food was good (other than the beer cheese & mustard dips being WAY too runny for the pretzel bites). The service was very good until it got crowded, then the server kinda disappeared, but everyone was very friendly. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family early Saturday evening for dinner. It was very cold outside and we were sat very close to the front door.  We were so cold that we had to keep our coats on. I didn't think much about it until at the end of our meal when I used the rest room and realized how large the place is and how warm it is in the rear. 

I ordered the railyard burger with cheddar cheese and onion rings.  The burger lacked flavor, I couldn't tell there was cheese.  The portion size was good, perfect I would say.  The onion rings tasted good and the portion size again was perfect.

The beer selection is good, and a nice thing is the ability to order a 4oz glass.  Perfect for the beers with a high abv. Even a traditional short pour is too much for me. So I got that plus a pint of a beer with 5 or 6 abv. Nice flexibility!"}
{"text":"Went there last week with a Groupon. Second time there. Wow, these guys have upped their game big time! New menu with lots of options and great appetizers. Got a wedge salad that was pretty good but not great. Probably should have ordered something different.  Waitstaff really gave 100% and kept us happy and served. I really was impressed with the improvements they've made in a very short time period."}
{"text":"just a quick update to my initial review. I think the service and food have improved. I still haven't found anything on the menu that's amazing but I really do like the fish sandwich and the fried pickle appetizer. Despite being standard pub fare, the portion sizes are very generous. Still the same great beer selection. However I really think this place would do itself a great service by reevaluating the decor and layout. It has no atmosphere."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! We tried to go here for dinner last Friday at 8:45 pm and 1/2 the restaurant was empty.  Bar was full though.  Asked for a table and we were told the wait would be 45 min because the kitchen was extremely backed up.  Staff was not particularly helpful at offering any help.  After walking around the bar trying to find a seat, we decided to leave and find another place to go.

Too many good places to go in Pittsburgh.  If you can't staff according to business demands you shouldn't be in business.  Moving on."}
{"text":"Decent! Came for lunch, service was excellent, very attentive. I ordered the  prime rib sandwich, it was okay. It's bar food for sure though. Fries were undercooked. Yes it's new and they are still tuning their system. I would absolutely recommend others come in for a drink and maybe try the food too. I don't know if the food is worth the trip alone though."}
{"text":"CLOSED!!! Closed until further notice due to being flooded. Our town was hit hard. Many businesses are closed down. Call them for info"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nicely decorated, great beer selection etc.

Friendly albeit slow waitstaff.

Kitchen was having an \"off\" night.   I ordered the pork loin with mashed potatoes.   The food came out ice cold and the pork was too tough to even cut with the knife provided.

Our waiter took it back and instantly brought me another pork loin sans potatoes.    This pork was warm, but also tough as rubber.   The fresh potatoes followed but again were room temperature.

I took two bites and asked for a manager who removed my meal from the check.   Just a shame we waited another 15 minutes for that check.

Not sure if I'll give this one another try or not.."}
{"text":"So, pretty sure this is my first Yelp review. . 
With the election campaigns over, I hate to run a smear ad on another reviewer. . But, a \"Coors Light\" bar? Really? There are 50 taps. All craft except for maybe 6, depending what you call craft or not. For the remaining 45 craft and quality import lines 4 are nitro lines. Stout heavy for the season, , which no one does, 3-4 sour/wild lines, 4-5 cider lines. . . So many rare and new release beers I couldn't try them all while I was there, despite the option of a full or 4oz pour. 
Sourcing barracuda and other fresh fish from Honolulu Fish company, Pork and Beef from PGH area farms. . Shit is legit.

They aren't having a \"grand opening\" for another few weeks, I think. But, . . \"Coors Light bar\". . Sorry they didn't have Miller Lite on draft for you.

Mako Tacos were great."}
{"text":"We expected a true tap room with in-house beer options. OK not the case but we were shocked to see beer #1 on the list is Coors Light. This place is very confused...decor hints at old time rail yards but the overwhelming feeling is college bar with the black walls + ceiling. Cheap wallpaper to look like wood planked walls. College hip hop dance music playing at 8pm and sports bar atmosphere. Who do they want to attract...?  We ordered burgers and they were the best part of our time there. No plans to return."}
{"text":"We stood at the front at the hostess stand for 5 minutes before anyone came over (the place was almost empty). When someone did finally come over I said something about waiting and she replied she was just the bartender and didn't know where the hostess was, nor did she apologize (or even seem to care). Although the beer selection was nice, we had dinner and the food was absolutely horrible. I had the Rueben which was not made with corned beef but rather some variation of ground beef and I only took a few bites and didn't touch the rest. When I mentioned to the server it was bad, there was no offer of anything else or a reduction or removal of the meal from our bill. My husband had a burger which was ok, but they didn't toast the bun so the bun was soggy. Service was rather slow as well. Overall we were very disappointed as we live close and were excited for it to open as we watched its transformation from Tambellini's."}
{"text":"They had an amazing beer selection, the food could be a bit better (but if you like spicy food definitely try the spicy habanero sauce on some wings) the atmosphere was enjoyable, and the service was excellent. If you go, ask for Alyssa, she was my husband and I's server and by far the best waitress in the place, service with a smile, quick, and very informative about the menu. If you are ever in Bridgeville, looking for a new spot to drink and eat, make sure to stop by this place."}
{"text":"It's a quiet Sunday afternoon and this place is empty.  I don't get it. I'm drinking a phenomenal German Kolsch, which tastes super fresh and eating some really good wings.  A really good beer list (50 taps) with lots of varied options, particularly for this area.  How is this place not packed every day?!?!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Menu items unique but poorly executed or items were unavailable. Would go back for beer only. The atmosphere was energetic."}
{"text":"Normally go to this place once a month because food/drinks are solid, same with service and location.  Tonight's experience will likely lead me to never return.

Took 90 minutes to get a side salad.  They clearly lost our order which they did apologize for & said they'd take 50% off our bill.  All the food arrived at the 2 hr mark but all the food was terrible.  Cold, over cooked, the one item we ordered well done was med-rare.  Just really poor execution.

By the time the bill arrived, they took $33 off which was roughly a third.  By that point, I was so frustrated with the experience & lack of communication, I paid it & left.

There's not a lack of \"try\" or \"care\" at this place.  You can tell there's effort in some regard but the entire place is disorganized (from front of the house to the kitchen). 

There were other tables complaining about service & food while we were there.  Totally get there can be off nights but this was enough to keep us from returning."}
{"text":"This is my first time at the Railyard. I have to say I really enjoyed it. I came with a buddy and we sat at the bar. First thing you will notice is there are a ton of beers on tap. I didn't count but I would bet it was close to 40! Ok you have my attention.

The menu is small but the food is delicious. Plus they have poutine which is hard to find anywhere. Owner must be Canadian eh? Anyways, I ended up ordering the Fire Box Ring Stinga burger. You would think the name would be warning enough, but no, I just had to have it. It was flaming hot! The jalapeños and habaneros teamed up to put a hurt on me. I didn't finish it because I couldn't stand the heat.

The place is deceptively big inside. They have a lot of seating and a huge bar area. They even have some couches to relax on! There are tv's everywhere and the sound system is tied into them which was pretty cool watching the pens game. I usually get yelled at for turning the volume up when the pens score, but not here!

Anyways, stop by and give it a try!"}
{"text":"My wife works in Bridgeville and we found this place close by her work.  There is no parking lot, on street parking only. We arrived around lunch time on Friday and there weren't many people inside. The front of the restaurant is all windows and it was fairly chilly inside even though we were seated close to the back of the restaurant. Neither of us removed our jackets.

For lunch, my wife and I decided to split everything we ordered. We ended up trying the hummus platter, breakfast pizza, burger, onion rings, baked beans, and chocolate chip baked cookie and ice cream. The hummus platter was decent and featured carrots, pita bread, and celery.  The hummus itself had a little kick to it but the cumin in it was a little overpowering.  Burger was just OK, a little pricey for my tastes.  The breakfast pizza with maple syrup, sausage, and egg was a very interesting concept. At times it tasted like pizza, and other times like french toast. Enjoyed trying something different but not sure I would get it again. The baked beans were different but not good and I would avoid them. The chocolate chip baked cookie and ice cream was by far my favorite though being warm, soft, and very tasty!

Overall, I thought the experience was OK. I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again, but would choose some different food items. I imagine the bar type food shines here (plus the baked cookies!) as well as an excellent selection of beers on tap at a price on par with anywhere you would go. This place seems to be an above average bar with OK food and would come back for drinks on the next visit."}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner on a Friday evening. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They have a huge beer list which is good if you're into trying new beers. However, my one complaint would be there was very loud rap music playing from the bar area at 6pm? It was a little much and distracting while trying to our enjoy our dinner in the regular seating area. Because of that, I'm not sure I'll rush to go back."}
{"text":"Boring. Food isn't anything to write home about. Really it's only good to come and watch sports on all the tvs."}
{"text":"Deserves a 5 star for service alone!  Our waiter was great, very knowledgeable on the menu and made great suggestions.  The pizza and burgers here are on point as well!  Will definitely become a regular"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out last night for the first time. He had the \"This is not a Reuben\" I had the Margarita Pizza and we had the Dirty Fries as well. The sandwich was a little dry and not as good as a traditional Reuben. The pizza was fine, nothing special. I didn't enjoy the fries. They didn't have any flavor! It was just OK, not good enough for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place purely because there was a Groupon for it. The mixed reviews had kept me from trying it before now. We went on a Thursday with a party of 5 and were seated right away. The service was friendly and the menu was a good mix of choices to appease our picky eaters. I ordered the veggie burger with onion rings. It was definitely one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had. Everyone in our party was very pleased with their meals, which doesn't happen often. The beer list was huge and the atmosphere was nice. We will definitely be back and check out the bar next time."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have worked in the restaurant/service industry before.  As a server, FOH manager and bartender.  I am not here to bash this place but they have some SERIOUS work to do.  I don't know it is was just an off night  but we had a terrible experience.  First, the place was not very busy and it took 25 minutes to get our cocktails (after they were ordered).  The waiter seemed inexperienced and very insecure which I felt for him.  There was no presence of management.  Our food took an hour and a half.  We were there for 2 hours with small children.  It was sort of a disaster.  The quality of the food was below average as well.  I want to see this place succeed because it's another option for us to go with our kids and friends.  They need to regroup or call Bar Rescue.  :("}
{"text":"GRAND OPENING...great food and beer selections. Had the bbq burger and pierogi pizza which was tasty. BEST WISHES to the newest foodie stop in Bridgeville! Special thanks to our server Becky!"}
{"text":"Really sweet little place. I like the nightlife feel to this place. They have a lot of really yummy choice on their menu. I like how to place is located right next to a railroad it just gives the place a really cool setting."}
{"text":"Tried this place because we wanted to and we had a groupon. Service was awful, food was terrible, and I like just a simple domestic beer and I was looked upon as goofy because I don't enjoy craft beers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last night with a group of five.  Service was very good, and there is now a new, much larger menu.  Everybody was happy with their food.   I enjoyed the Fish & Chips (comes with Hushpuppies), and one of our party said the meatloaf dinner was excellent (I thought it looked pretty good myself).  And of course, they still offer 50 different crafts on draught, plus a nice selection of bottles, and a full bar too.   Looking forward to coming back again and trying some of the other new menu items."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best.
Mulligatawny soup was unrecognizable. It was a bowl of mush."}
{"text":"Another great meal at the Railyard. Our 2nd time there, and it's now on our favorites list. Today was the BBQ burger, cooked medium well, topped with cheddar cheese, pulled pork, candied bacon, jalapenos, and house made bbq sauce. Excellent!! Cooked perfect, juicy, pulled pork was tender and juicy. A great burger. Family had the meatloaf. Packed with chunks of onions, peppers, garlic, topped with a homemade gravy, and a side of roasted red potatoes. A great comfort food meal. Mom had the Cuban sandwich. I tried it, it was freaking delicious,  one of the best Cubans I've had. Piled high roasted pork, smoked ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and a dijonaise. Spectacularly good. The Railyard is a hit, worth the trip to Bridgeville."}
{"text":"We went for the beer but they didn't have what we wanted on tap. They were out. We stayed and ordered food. Our server was nice but we should have skipped eating. I ordered the stuffed meatball. It sounded really tasty. How can you go wrong with a meatball stuffed with cheese??? Unfortunately I found out how. The meatball, which was the size of a softball, had to have been pre-cooked. The outside tasted like char (a nice way of saying burnt). I was excited to cut the meatball open and see the melty cheese gush out. However it was served to me sliced in half. There was very little marinara sauce on it. When I say very little I mean a couple of tablespoons. The meat was definitely overlooked the whole way through. It was supposed to come with a couple of slices of bread. I had to ask for some. I was thinking I would get a nice fluffy piece of Italian bread but instead got a pita type of bread that had been laid on the grill for grill marks. The bread was almost to the point of stale and looked as sad as my meatball. 
It's a great looking place but it's not worth the trip for the food and call first if you are going for a specific beer."}
{"text":"Came here based on purchasing the Groupon! Draft list was awesome! Food was very good too. Got the pressed cuban.. delicious! Fried pickles were a bit too breaded/fried but still very tasty. Service manager was super welcoming and friendly. Only thing -I wish there was music playing! Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"I came with my two boys 3 and 5. The hostess was very nice and we were promptly seated at 6pm on Friday with no wait. There are plenty of TVs to keep the kids (and dads) entertained. Our server Taron (sorry-probably misspelled)was attentive and polite as well as good with the kids. The draft list is extensive (50 beers) but unfortunately anything with a higher alcohol content is served in a 10 ounce glass. My burger hit the spot and was well above average. I didn't get to try any pizza because my kids ate it all :). Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I decided to give this restaurant a try and purchased a Groupon.  We had a reservation and seated immediately.  The waitress and assistant manager were very pleasant, courteous, and efficient.  I ordered the steelhead trout.  When it arrived it looked just like salmon but I was assured it was trout.  I ordered the squash and salad as sides.  The meal was perfectly prepared and delicious.  My date had the meatloaf and liked it. The restaurant was clean.  It was a good experience and I will return.  I have no complaints.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight to try it, not sure what to expect, but had a really nice time.  First off, let me say - 50 BEERS ON TAP!  I mean, seriously, have two or three of those, and you won't have a bad thing to say about the place, or anything else for that matter!!  The service was great, met the managers due to my husband's food allergy, and our waitress was very friendly, accommodating, and attentive.  The food was different, but decent, and there were many things on the menu I wanted to try, but didn't, like the wing sauce made with the Pumpking.  If only I could eat more at one sitting.  We will definitely be back, we were very happy with the service and the staff.  Oh, and the bourbon peach crisp, just YUM."}
{"text":"We stopped by for an hour or so last night night. They had a fantastic selection of beer- 50 different ones on tap. They let you pick as many samples as you'd like for a flight. We started off with four, and then tried 3 more. 

My husband ordered wings. He was looking for a specific flavor that wasn't available, but our server made suggests that worked for him. We also shared the Mulligatawny soup and some Samosas. Both fantastic. Our server was terrific and a manager stopped by to see how things were. We didn't have to wait for a table, our food was up quick, and our check was about $35.  Not bad.  All it in all, it was a good night. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Second visit.  The menu was a little different, a few changes I think, looks like a couple items have been taken off the menu.  Heard our waitress say to the people next to us that they have not had an official grand opening because they want to get everyone trained and work out any opening issues.  
Anyway, I thought the pizza was good.  It is a 10 inch pizza with homemade sauce that is not sweet with a nice tomato taste and mozzarella cheese.  
Anyway, looks like this will be a nice comfy place.  There are a couple of coaches behind the bar and you can sit and relax and hang out."}
{"text":"We came for lunch and the food and beer selection was fantastic! We sat at the bar and Chrissy made us feel like friends. The atmosphere is typical for new bars these days. There are options for vegans and vegetarians on the menu that are very flavorful and filling. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was...interesting. It was our first time here and the first thing we thought when we looked at the menu was that the place was having an identity crisis. You can get wings, cheese fries, you can get Indian food, you can get Mexican food, and you can get Asian...it just feels lost. 1) The beer cheese fries were delicious. 2) The dry rub wings were overdone, wings burnt.  However, the buffalo wings were pretty juicy. And the wings are big and meaty which of course I liked. 3) The ahi tuna was pretty good but again just seems weird that it's on the menu. 4) The fish and chips were okay. The fish itself was better than the preparation. Tartar sauce was bland. But I guess you can get seafood here too? 5) The side of tikka we got was definitely not tikka...it was more like a yellow curry sauce.  
The worst thing was probably out waitress who we thought seemed like she might be high. She forgot to bring side plates so some other server brought them and then when our waitress brought them, we told her that but she shoved them on our small table anyway. 
And on a side note, we sat at a high top table at the bar and our chairs were very wobbly and not sturdy at all...I thought they might break."}
{"text":"First, I want to let you know that to-go boxes here are made of paper, not styrofoam.  Yay!  I love the sandwiches from the neighboring pizza shop, but I seldom order them because their takeout boxes are styrofoam.  I appreciate The Railyard's conscientiousness, but that's not why I eat there.

Their food is really good.  I think these are my favorite fries in Pittsburgh, and you get a heaping plate full with your order.  I love their burgers, satisfying half-pounders with buns that hold up.  My girlfriend had the CBLT, and she loved it.  We've eaten here a couple of times, and the food has been great!  

Also, their happy hour goes until 8:00!  You can eat dinner on happy hour without risk of midnight munchies!  I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out. It's new, it's beautiful inside and close to home. My expectations were high and it was not what I imagined. My waitress was standoffish, the food wasn't great for the price and the cocktails I ordered didn't taste good either. There are so many other places, definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Had a fun evening catching up with friends here! We were looking for somewhere that takes reservations for larger groups and we were glad they took our party of ten with no hassle at all. We came on a Wednesday night and the happy hour specials were reasonably priced. They have a great beer selection with many varieties. The menu had many different bad unique options to try from as well. I had the margarita pizza and we also ordered the beer cheese fries. The fries were yummy, but huge, so I would recommend definitely splitting these with someone! I enjoyed the pizza as well. Everyone seemed happy with their meals and drinks. Service was friendly and we were also asked by I believe the manager, how our evening was, which was nice. We were also told there is Trivia on Monday nights which we can't wait to try out! One recommendation is to have the air on or some extra fans since a few of us were pretty hot most of the night. We look forward to coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Let me start off, the food is very good. The portions are large, the menu offers a large variety of better-than-average bar style food. Add the groupon deals to it and it becomes amazing.

The atmosphere and beer list are also very good.

However, there is little parking, so don't expect to park nearby during peak hours.

That all being said, the WORST thing is their take home containers. I know it sounds silly, but when you take home a large portion of your meal, you expect to eat it, right?

No thought at all was put into functionality when they chose PAPER take home containers, and not even the nice ones you'd get at a fast food place. Imagine going to your fridge, looking forward to finishing off that delicious mac & cheese and trainwreck fries. You find the containers soggy from absorbing the moisture from the meal, your fingers punch through the bottom when you pick it up. You make to transfer it to a bowl, because you aren't stupid, you know putting paper in the microwave is a fire risk. As you try to transfer the food the container shreds, leaving shredded paper throughout your meal, giving you the aggrivating task of picking paper bits from your once-delicious meal....

Needless to say, after spitting paper out of a few mouthfuls I got annoyed and chucked the whole meal in the trash.

Being ecofriendly is great, but come on, paper containers for food? That was idiotic, and shows lack of forethought. Whomever makes the decisions clearly doesn't ever take the food home for themselves.

Wasting otherwise good food really pisses me off, that is why I gave it 3 stars, otherwise it would be 4."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after taking an instrument for repair in Canonsburg.  The beer selection is great, happy hour specials are awesome, food is very reasonably priced, especially for the portions, and the bartenders were friendly.

I had a couple of beers, basically just two Deschutes Red Chair pale ales (a new favorite of mine).  I was looking at burgers, as one of my choices, and one of the bartenders suggested the turkey burger with red-pepper hummus.  Turkey?  Good.  Hummus?  Yes, please.  I paired it with some redskin mashed potatoes.  As if the taters weren't tasty enough, the burger was ON-POINT.  They did forget the hummus on the burger, so the bartender didn't waste any time bringing me out a big cup of it.  Holy cow, as guy Fieri says, \"This is a trip to flavor town!\"  A little char on the burger, with a super-juicy inside.  Turkey can easily be dry, but not the case here.  This thing was so good, that I actually fist-bumped the bartender.  I stayed for dessert, and got their homemade cookie (peanut butter was my choice), paired with vanilla ice cream.

I'll definitely be back!"}
