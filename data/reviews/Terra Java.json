{"text":"Just kind of a crap coffee place. Been here a couple of times when others have suggested it as a meeting place.

Bland square room with a few tables/chairs, etc. Layout is poor so about 50% of the tables abuts against the line of people waiting to order and/or people waiting for their orders to be delivered. A big pet peeve of mine is having to sit at a table while people in line are brushing up against me and talking over me. Not their fault. Fault of the lazy cafe design. 

Coffee/tea = good enough. Food = poor, like most small cafes with a small kitchens (Urban Beans, Hava Java, etc).

So what would make me go here? Great atmosphere and service. As some of the others have noted, the service here is sub-par, which is usually the sign of an absentee manager paying very low wages. Bad morale = bad service.

It's in a strip mall, and a crowded strip mall at that, so the parking, while available, is often a pain.

1) Hard to access, 2) Not comfortable to visit, 3) Not pleasant to deal with staff = fail. Sorry."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's quiet and not crowded so I can use their Wi-Fi and get work done. Good coffee, good treats."}
{"text":"Tasty coffees made with care. Food like it was made at home. A nice alternative to chain coffee joints."}
{"text":"The coffee is great! But if you want to drink it this century, go somewhere else. The staff cannot be bothered to move faster than a glacial pace. There was one couple in front of me and three staff behind the counter. I waited over ten minutes to place my order. Then I paid $4.50 for my coffee and the staff was so busy making drinks for themselves that I waited another ten minutes. Usually if I go to a place like this, I chalk it up to one bad visit, but I have given them 3 chances. That's all they get!"}
{"text":"Usually really good cappuccinos, and their baked goods are pretty good.  But they need to clean out their toaster and stop burning toast.  And this last time the cappuccino was terrible - bitter, too hot, terrible foam.  I brought it back and not only did the barrista give me excuses about how its so busy in the morning (a ridiculous excuse because we always come in the morning, and it wasn't that busy), and then had the gall to charge me to get a regular drip coffee."}
{"text":"I love coming here on Saturday mornings to start off my weekend on the right foot! They have wonderful, made-in-house pastries (many of which are gluten/dairy free) and really good coffee made by knowledgable baristas. I've enjoyed everything from a basic honey latte to an earl grey steamer here (with lavender syrup?!), every single drink has been great. They support local coffee roasters like Press and Cartel and primarily brew their beans. Local art hanging on the walls, free wifi, nice people."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened - I stopped by in the middle of the day, during the week.

No \"hello\" or \"welcome\", no \"thanks\", no \"good-bye\", no \"can I get you anything else?\".  I think all the cashier/barista said was \"OK\" when I told her my order of a mint-lemonade and paid.  I think it goes without saying that all else I got was a scowl.

After my order, she kindly set my drink down on the finished drinks area with nary a word.  As a first time visitor I figured out where my drink was, a few minutes later, as she was nowhere to be found to ask \"hey, where's my drink??\".

The space is decent, though the leather couches have certainly seen better days. Plenty of books to gaze upon while enjoying your beverage, but essentially no other positives as far as I can tell.

I will certainly never return."}
{"text":"This establishment is the quintessential neighborhood coffee house staffed with friendly and accommodating baristas, local artistry works for sale, and free wifi that encourages you to sip a pleasant brewed cup with friends or host an impromptu business meeting.  I highly recommend your support of local businesses such as this one."}
{"text":"Was a fan before (when it was Mama Java's) and I am a fan now!  I really dig what they have done with the place.  Gave it a bit of a facelift:)  In addition to having tasty coffee/non-coffee beverages, they also have a nice assortment of house-made pastries (some vegan and/or gluten-free), tasty breakfast scrambles, quiche, a granola waffle?!, lunch sandwiches, artwork, and more!  

The peeps behind the counter are delightful and they always have decent tunes playing out over the rooms.  They keep things green by using an ipad as the register, with the option of receiving your receipt by way of email.  Who doesn't love hugging a tree when they purchase a cup of joe?

It's really a great neighborhood hang spot whether you're looking to chill out with a cup and a book or have a mini business meeting or catch up with old friends."}
{"text":"I love Terra Java. The coffee is great and the customer service is incredible!"}
{"text":"I live nearby. I went in for the 2nd time today. The first visit disappointed when the barista laughed at my order. The second visit disappointed because coffee was not brewed in the morning hours. It's expected that a coffee shop will anticipate coffee orders before 10am. I was told to wait 5 minutes. 5 minutes, still no coffee so I left. I will not go back. Staff was nice today."}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised by the vibe in Terra Java. It is incredibly relaxed and chill. I would definitely do my grad school work here during the day. 

They are short handed. When I came in only one person was working and she was incredibly kind and talkative even though she could not take my order right away. She talked me through their menu while she was making orders. She was pleasant the whole time. 

Their coffee is actually pretty good and I was pleasantly surprised. I am a loyal Starbucks/Dutch Bros girl and I would definitely go to Terra Java again."}
{"text":"As recently as a couple months ago, this was one of my favorite coffee places - for both convenience and quality of beverage. Now it's simply awful and I think I'm done with them. Their dirty chai was among the best and their iced coffee was delicious. Today's dirty chai was the second-worst I've ever had and Jessica's two shots over ice tasted like cold vomit. Took them back in and, after implying disbelief that something may have been wrong, I instead got two large black cold brews. Even those were awful - thin, weak, poor tasting, and shaken (leaving nearly half the cup coffee-less). Who shakes cold brew??!? Service has also gotten worse. They move at a snail's pace and can only seem to do one task at a time. I could occasionally deal with slow service - if my drinks actually tasted at least average. But anymore, this place is just awful. Sorry guys. I used to love you."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite places when it was Mama Java's.  This was the first time I have been in there siince it changed ownership and names.  Place is not nearly the same.  Service was friendly but extremely slow and very disorganized.  I waited in line behind a few people for nearly 10 minutes and ordered a coffee and bagel sandwich.  Got my coffee and had to wait another 5-10 minutes before they even started making the sandwich.  I watched in disbelief as the person who was handling money etc as the cashier started to make my food with his bare hands.  This is a major health code violation (cross containimation) so I requested my money back.  They have also raised their prices and it was way overpriced in my opinion.

Not the same experience I use to have when it was Mama Java's.  I recommend statying away and  will not be returning."}
{"text":"A great coffee shop with delicious coffee and a quiet atmosphere. They have great baked goods all day and paninis and  sandwiches for lunch"}
{"text":"Great place to chill and do work. Coffee and Tea is pretty good but food and customer service definitely needs improvement. Eat before you go!"}
{"text":"I need to amend my previous review which was based mostly on one excellent visit. After returning repeatedly and having my drink made by several different people, it seems that the quality of the beverage is totally dependent on which barista is making it. I've had excellent (see my previous review), decent, and one flat-out poor version of my preferred drink made here. Consistency is definitely lacking.

Also, the atmosphere tends to get quite noisy early in the day (seems to be about 9am-noon), as the cafe is popular with various talkative groups of people. If you're looking for a quieter experience, try early morning or later afternoon."}
{"text":"Love Terra Java! My soy chai latte was hot and delicious, and the atmosphere provided by the open mic was fantastic--it's the first wednesday of each month, from 6-8pm."}
{"text":"Terra Java is the pushing the coffee shop experience up a few levels. From the quality of their coffee, and the expert baristas behind the counter, to their unique food offerings, it's still a hidden gem in the valley. But not for much longer.

So good."}
{"text":"I always enjoy chatting with the counter staff.  They are friendly.  The coffee cups have shrunk since it was Mama Javas.  Large isn't so large anymore.  Charging $.50 for almond milk instead of cream in my coffee is petty.   I stop in occasionally because of convenience."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the years (formerly Mama Java) and was never too impressed. For whatever reason now that it is Terra Java, I am very pleased.

They offer a variety of milks (including rice milk) which is unique and a huge plus for someone like me who prefers alternate milks but tries to avoid too much soy. They also have vegan and gluten-free options when it comes to food and baked goods and with the growing number of health issues I find that to be very comforting.

One of the baristas recommended their spicy chai and now I'm addicted. It is very refreshing and has quite the kick to it. Makes for a brilliant dirty chai and I appreciate that it is a locally made reduction - much better than paying $5 for powdered milk w/ spices or Oregon chai that I could buy and make myself.

Overall, great little hang out. Always a friendly staff and quiet crowd."}
{"text":"What happened?  The coffee prices are a lot higher with the new owners.  We had coffee and lunch while there on Wed.  We were in the area on business.
The food choices are minimal - although the breakfast choices were pretty good.  The one young woman who tended the food service had no smile, no thank you and was in our opinion rude - wow - and the food service was slow.  
The other young woman at the register did smile and seemed friendly but again - an attitude in the place that was not there with the other owner - we did not feel good about the experience - we go to a lot of coffee places and not franchise types as a rule - and a lot of restaurants and know good service and a welcoming feel.  
Too bad - they bought a good neighborhood place and I am sure bought the whole package and now they are letting that go which is the good feel customers had from the buildup of good customer service of the previous owner.
MY MY  - oh girls - take a look around -- you have a lot of competition - this is not about you - it is about the customer - it is not about saying no it is about saying yes and thank you and how did you like it and did you enjoy yourself.  Amen."}
{"text":"Nice place for coffee and hang out with friends. A little warm sometimes though. Nice people and good service"}
{"text":"I'm always hunting for a good, locally owned coffee shop. 

This one didn't disappoint! I love how Terra Java is tucked in this little strip mall. It's got some pretty nice character. 

I was with my wife and sister when I stopped in for a quick drink. As we walked in, we were immediately greeted by the barista. She was genuinely nice and very pleasant. 

I liked the mismatched decor inside. It didn't feel very trendy or hipster-y, but very comfortable and laid back. There were several people inside working on their laptops, so I assume this place has wi-fi. 

Our drink orders were taken very quickly and the barista really sold us on the pastries. She basically said everything was good, so each of us got three different things. They all looked like they were made in house. Very moist, very good, and reasonably priced. 

If you're looking for a quiet place to sip your coffee and have a nice treat without the corporate Starbucks atmosphere, I'd go here!"}
{"text":"Love it here. First timer.  Nice open seating, great music and I like how a water came with my cortado. Perfect for being close to work- I will be back!"}
{"text":"My faves: pumpkin spice latte (with almond milk); the Wow bar (Gfree, vegan and low glycemic) & the gluten free coffee cake, gluten free pumpkin scone and other tasty Gfree treats."}
{"text":"Came here on recommendation from a good friend. He spoke highly of it and I figured I'd try it since I live about 2 blocks away. It's very spacious and located in a nice shopping center. Very clean and organized. 
One thing did make me upset, which wasn't anything related to the establishment.
There was only one person working at the time, so she had to take orders and make drinks. The lady at the very front seemed of the business type and in a hurry. She was upset because they didn't make \"frappuccinos\" which was funny because this wasn't starbucks, and there was a starbucks literally a block away with a quick drive thru. I assume she didn't know much about coffee.
The girl behind the counter is doing her best. Before she begins making the drinks she takes the other two people's order, which would only take a matter of seconds.
The business lady begins getting upset and demanding that she makes her drink first and then finishing everyone's order because \"she was here first.\" 
Seeing this made me upset because I also work in coffee and people like this who demand everything instantly and want it their way will go on yelp and bash on local business who are trying to do their. 
The lady demanding her money back and left, scoffing and spreading negativity like a cancer. 
I began chatting with the girl behind the counter. She was very nice and we had a mutual friend, which was the friend who recommended Terra Java to me in the first place. The iced coffee was a bit acidic, but enjoyable.
I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you love coffee, you need to come here and remember what coffee is meant to taste like. First timer, instant fan."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Mama Java's and now Terra Java's for the better part of a decade since I have lived in the Arcadia/Biltmore area.  Since becoming Terra Java, the place has undergone a pretty great transformation.  I love the neighborhood coffee shop vibe and Terra Java offers a wide variety of coffee, tea and other delicious drinks to suit a variety of patrons.  

They have modernized the place a little, but it still has a great old vibe with the wooden tables and its general look and feel.   They feature local artwork and crafts that are always interesting. There is a variety of healthy snacks, treats and some more filling options (sandwiches) available.   I always like the baked oatmeal.  I have tried to make this at home but it never turns out as well.    

They have remained true to their coffee shop roots here. The prices are reasonable and if you let them know you'll be hanging around for awhile, they'll save your tea leaves and give you a refill later!!  (Warning, you will smell like coffee when you leave this place!!  =) )

I come hang out and work from here for a few afternoons a month.  Free Wi-fi is available, and it's a pretty quiet place with some mellow tunes playing in the background.  Unless you catch live music or the storytellers club here, it's a great place to hang out and get some work done. The events are cool too, if you can come to watch and be entertained.

With all of that said, I recently had a bad experience here with a staff member being very rude to me.  I  called the Manager and spoke with her on the phone about the issue and she apologized and said that she did not condone the behavior of her staff member.   As a regular customer over the years,  I fully recognize that one bad experience with one particular staff member in about a decade  doesn't warrant a terrible review.   Nonetheless, Terra Java has some work to do to earn back my business."}
{"text":"Sad to see this place go... BUT I have found my new favorite coffee spot JUST DOWN THE STREET!!! White Cup Coffee on the corner of 40th and Indian School!!! Much friendlier atmosphere too!! Go check it out."}
{"text":"I decided to try a new local coffee shop this morning to start the week off right but unfortunately this was the wrong coffee shop.  Very slow service and over priced.  No one in line and only one employee.  I ordered an Americano and a turkey pesto panini which came out to $10 +change.  For the price I did not expect the panini to be premade, gross, and still take 10 minutes to heat up.  

If you are in search of a local coffee shop I recommend Jobot, Lola's, Cartel, Lux, or Songbird.  

Avoid Terra Java."}
{"text":"A while ago they were changing ownership and now they no longer have any vegan baked goods (not that they had a lot before). It's quieter than most coffee shops and there is plenty of space - perfect for meeting friends or studying/working. Customers and staff are friendly like a good neighborhood coffee shop should be. They make a good rich latte or mocha. I haven't tried anything else. I'd probably go here more often of they had some (clearly labeled) vegan food options. We have money to spend and we love to eat!"}
{"text":"Their coffee has changed with new management. I told the owner of the issue with my sour coffee. He did not remake the drink. Further, he suggested the problem was me, and turned away. No voices were raised, no profanity or impoliteness, only indifference. I accepted the owner's position and left 2/3rds of my undrinkable cappuccino in their bin."}
{"text":"I ordered some cookies to have sent out for a party I was having, and they were a huge hit!! The Maple Snickerdoodles, Peanut Butters, Pecan Pie Bars and Mexican Lime Margaritas were all incredible. I personally made sure to have at least 3 of each. (*Sad, but true.. and oh so good!*) The Butter Oaties and Brownie Crinkles were big hits with the in-laws. Omei did an awesome job assembling secure boxes and the cookies got to us in great shape. Wish I lived closer so I could indulge in these more often!! :)"}
{"text":"Just really, really good coffee!  Good smiley service too!!

I am a latte' purist, don't give me flavors, non-fat milk or fancy sweeteners in my latte'!!  I want 4% milk and good coffee to stand up to the milk!  Terra Java's proprietary blend is the bomb!

You can also find housemade baked goods from Chef O' that are to die for!!  She specializes in gluten free baked goods and eats too!"}
{"text":"Spacious inside with some inviting configurations for seating, this place served me an afternoon Americano that was as extra bold as the place. 

My barista seemed to be the only one on the floor. I did forget to ask for my drink in a stay here ceramic mug, which I much prefer. I wasn't asked and just forgot to mention it during my order. 

There was some yummy looking goodies, but at the time, I only needed espresso. If you like your espresso super strong, then this is the place for you. Definitely a relaxed atmosphere and super quiet in the late afternoon."}
{"text":"Had a Chemex pour over for the first time in my coffee experience and they did a great job."}
{"text":"Coffee was delicious and baked good was moist and flavorful...had the carrot cake muffin. Both the girl and guy that worked there were very friendly and good hearted. Nothing fancy pants ambience-wise but background music was good and they support local artists.  Good spot to study/do work."}
{"text":"The wifi password says it all. \"thankyou\". They mean it with all their heart. Every time I've walked in the door they are just so kind. Amazingly sweet. Coffee, smoothies await you. As do a short list of sandwiches and paninis. 

I'm pleased to report the wifi is lightning quick. There are copious amounts of outlets. And super comfortable couch (dare I say it? :) take a nap on. The walls are lined with that is for sale.

If you need a cup of coffee at 6am - this is the place to be!

[Update}
Reporting live from this joint. 

The owners clearly have thought this out. A regular cup of joe comes with a free re-fill. So you can pop-in, get your to-go cup, get your nails done and then (!) get another cup of coffee. 

So I moved from a mango smoothie (which you should try) to a vanilla latte. The Phoenix weather is a tad chilly for my sandal clad feet. (I was enticed by the $1 off check-in deal on Yelp.)

My God. They know how to do it here. 

I think the biggest challenge the owners might encounter would be folks like me. I'd never leave :) Stacks of magazines, newspapers and music fill the space. It is easy to have a meeting here. Eye balling the dog treat jar labeled \"Woof!\" they must be dog friendly too.  Love it.

*sigh*"}
{"text":"Super casual laid back atmosphere. Grab your book, laptop or tablet, order a cup of Joe and curl up on the cozy sofa. Check in on Yelp and you get a free cookie!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm a big foodie myself, very critical, and I can say with all honesty that this place has some delicious food and pastries. The best part about it is that they are all gluten free! Trying to find anywhere else that specializes in all gluten free foods...let's just say that it's a challenge. And I love the vibe of the cafe....very arsty and free spirited, along with great service!"}
{"text":"Nice hideaway that supports local flavors. Yummy treats and  delightful brews in a nice quiet atmosphere...nice find."}
{"text":"I work right upstairs, and I recently decided to try their lattes. Needless to say, it was one of the best lattes that I've had in a while. I'll be making this one of my regular spots for sure."}
