{"text":"Simply the best of any restaurant that specializes Pork. I can't say enough about the quality.  I enjoyed the Pork Loin sub. The sandwich comes with Slaw or Peppers and Onions and is Really delightful. The pork loin is really tender and juicy, not dry as there is nothing worse in my opinion.  The interior of the business is clean and refreshing. The service is second to none. Led by the always accommodating Chubby Tony, whom I think is simply the best Chef / Waiter / Counter helper in town. If you have the chance, stop in and see for yourself. Please ask for Chubby Tony during your visit, trust me you will not want anyone else. He is worth the visit. I hope Chubby Tony never leaves, I love his cooking."}
{"text":"I live extremely close to this restaurant, but have just recently decided to stop in and grab a bite to eat. The place is decorated quite pleasantly and the staff was generous. The menu is not overwhelming and surely anyone can find something that suits their current mood. I ordered the kielbasa and sauerkraut sub with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The sandwich was phenomenal. The kielbasa was cooked to perfection and simply tasted amazing. The prices are more than fair due to the large portions they have to offer. I was actually unable to finish the entire sub in one sitting. Needless to say, this restaurant will likely become one of my go-to places when I am in the mood for anything pork related."}
{"text":"We ordered the Colossal BLT today. Needless to say I could only eat 1/4 of the sandwich it was so big. Very good quality and the bread was very fresh.  My daughter and I shared and still with the both of us we could only eat half, my husband on the other hand ate his whole 2 lb bacon sandwich.  When we called to order the women was so pleasant and was eager to help us in anyway possible as this was our first time ordering. I will be recommending this restaurant to everyone i know. I can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"We just picked up dinner. Had a classic BLT and a bone-in chop dinner. Food was outstanding. Place looked great inside. Menu is fun and creative. Best of luck! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have this place come to my neighborhood!! We're seriously lacking in the restaurant department!!   We got takeout on Friday night and I have to say I was very happy with everything.   I got the club sandwich with dill mayo, yes you heard that right, dill mayo! The flavors were so good together!! Next time I will definitley ask for the bread to be toasted, I thought all club sandwiches came with toasted bread?! But I guess not. :)   I also wanted to try a side of their angel hair with sauce and that was good too! The sauce is very traditional, so I can see it appealing to a lot of people.   I definitely want to go back and try so many more things on their menu!!"}
{"text":"New and wonderful! Well designed imaginative space with an 'all piggy' menu. Small space with BIG flavor. I had the 'Cheesy Piglet', grilled cheese and bacon and my companion had the 'Classic BLT'. Both were delicious. The special mayos (there are five) made my friend say \"The best BLT in his life!\" I must mention the counter person, Miranda. A personable young woman with a warm welcome. The owners also stopped to chat. Tony and Natalie. Hard work, enthusiasm and much humor. We wish them well in this new endeavor. We will see them again soon...pork your hunger! Thanks."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch, all I could say is we will definitely be back.  I had the pulled pork nachos and he had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich both were excellent!!"}
{"text":"Wow wow weee wow. Oh my... the pulled pork sandwich, oh the loin and oh the BLT CLUB... we ate a lot. My favorite place for pig in Pittsburgh!  Also the dude who wrote the 2 star review... I'm pretty sure you accidentally crossed the street and ate at Sunoco. Was it really dark? Were you drinking? Did you find food in a bobcat? That was the rental place next door."}
{"text":"A little restaurant with great food! First time there for lunch--the pork just melted in my mouth! Put the place on your list of local restaurants to visit. Give the Chain places a break!!"}
{"text":"This place is very cute and trendy! I absolutely loved the sand which I got! All the ingredients were fresh and very very flavorful. I got the barnyard sandwich, and it was so good I don't know if I can try anything else. The bacon was so thick and it was cooked perfectly! The owners are a local married couple that grew up in Lincoln Place. They were very warm and inviting, and they shared great stories of their days growing up. If you haven't tried this place yet, you must stop cheating yourself! I neeeeed this place to stay around, so hurry up and get here already! There is no going back once you've been porked!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch & was thoroughly impressed. Tony knows what to do with a pig...oh my, I had the cordon blue sandwich & it did not disappoint. Moist, tender & huge. This spot is a must & a definite repeat. If only I could lay down at my job for an hour or so after lunch my day would be perfect."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Pork place in Pittsburgh.  The Pulled Pork sandwich was full of flavor and the bread was so fresh.  The Pork Chop sandwich was one of the best I ever had.  Service was amazing. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I got Porked!  Nice little sandwich shop that specializes in Pork.  Some interesting sandwiches.  I went with just the Pulled Pork with the seasoned Pork (the options are BBA and sriracha style) instead of one of the more interesting sandwiches.  It come on a fresh bun with a house made slaw that was very tasty including some onions and green pepper in the slaw.  I thought the sandwich was OK, the meat was a little on the dry side.  Am interested in trying the Chop sandwich and the Cheesy Piglet. We walked in after a small group and had to wait a little but everything is prepared to order and the wait was not to long.  There are 3 usable tables that were all full but we were doing carry out."}
{"text":"Perfect name for a perfect little place with big pork offerings.  WOW!!!  There were so many things to try --- so the three of us who went together got three different things and shared bites!  One person had the pulled pork sandwich... it was good and had coleslaw on the sandwich!  The Barnyard was next -  turkey (heated on the grill), ham and bacon, cheese and garlic mayo (there are other flavors of mayo to try too).  I had the pork chop sandwich, apparently people are leery of the bone???  Well I spent 10+ years in Chicago and frequented Maxwell St that has the best ever pork chop sandwich!  The owner said their sandwich was as inspired by Chicago -- but PORKED takes the pork chop sandwich to new heights !!!  The pork chop is smoked to perfection....that right there is a wonderful thing!  Then there is yellow mustard (of course Maxwell Street) and grilled onions and peppers on a super fresh bun!!!  WOW!!!    The Barnyard and the Pork Chop were the favorites!  There are many many more sandwiches to try!  Can't believe it took us so long to get there!!    Like they say, \"pork your hunger\"!  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!! You MUST try the pork chop sandwich and the bacon chocolate chip cookies! You won't be disappointed!"}
