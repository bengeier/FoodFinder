{"text":"This restaurant gets 3 stars and earned an extra one for their tiramisu desert.  

We were driving around looking for an Italian place in the area and decided to try this place when it was the only one that wasn't close for a month of summer holidays.  Initial impression of the service was a little brusque but that improved as the night wore on.

We were served bread (which was unfortunately not warm) and butter after we ordered our food.  Our Calamari appetizer was not bad.  The calamari itself was a little flavourless but the doneness was perfect.  When we used the bread to soak up the sauce after, it was actually quite delicious.  

I ordered the Spaghetti Putanesca and my partner got the Gnocchi in Rose Sauce.  I really liked my Putanesca.  It was flavourful and adding some fresh ground pepper added a little kick which is right up my alley.  My partner enjoyed his Gnocchi but I thought the sauce was a little heavy for me.  All dishes were just a titch under seasoned.  

To end the meal we shared a tiramisu which was really heavenly.  There is an Italian supermarket next door where I am going back to investigate if they sell the tiramisu for me to enjoy in the comfort of my own home.  It was spongy and was not too sweet and just melt-in-your-mouth goodness!

I would definitely go back to Il Chianti again as I am curious how all the other delicious sounding items on the menu will be.  Overall, an above average restaurant with a good selection on the menu and amazing tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Great food. Came in in a hoodie got overlooked for how I was dressed. Despite the fact I ordered a 50 buck bottle of wine off the hop. Sorry I'm in comfy clothes with 2 beautiful girls. Doesn't mean you sluff me off. Just saying."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time after my sister recommended it.  It did not disappoint!  The food and wine was excellent and well priced, the service was wonderful, and the interior of the restaurant absolutely blew me away.  From the outside, it looks quite casual, but every detail is carefully thought out on the inside."}
{"text":"Horrible service, quality, and atmosphere. Over priced and overrated. We were completely ignored by our waitstaff, and unsure of who it even was. Neither of  the two staff knew anything about the menu when asked by us or the table beside us. The dirty appetizer plates were cleared with our entree plates at the end, when we were finally asked how our food was (mediocre at best). The only time the service was prompt was when the waiter was collecting our money. Will never return."}
{"text":"Friday dinner with Friends proved there is a truly world class Italian restaurant here in Calgary! The flavor was so good in all our choices that we are still thinking if it today! How often does that happen folks??"}
{"text":"#130 Lucky for me, I had my Vancouver posse visiting for the last weekend of warm weather (well the last 2 days of warm weather and first 2 days of normal weather) in Calgary this past weekend (before Remembrance Day). I say lucky because when I visit Vancouver, they always wine and dine me just right.

So, I thought to myself, this is my turn and this is my day. (Un) fortunately, they had other plans as a friend of theirs whom lives 5 blocks east of this establishment was oh so kind to take myself, a fellow yelper, my 2 friends, himself, his daughter, and his sister to Il Chianti and PAY on Saturday, 8 November.

Our reservation was at 7pm and we were promptly seated. Apparently, the person so kind enough to pay is well known and was well received by our waitress, Victoria, whom was so kind to welcome the four of us whom had never graced this establishment. She also explained the daily specials and the most popular dishes including dessert.

Appetizers included the very lightly breaded calamari fritti and non-breaded calamari alla franco with the best best best best (did I say best already) tomato sauce I have ever relished, as well as hot and apparently fresh baked breads.

My dish was the spaghette alla carbonara which consists of bacon, whipped eggs, cream, and parmigiano cheese while 2 of the other patrons order the rack of lamb which if memory serves was some special, and one ordered a salad and we all shared. The portions even relative to the price are quite large, nicely made, and succulent.

Important: their mashed potatoes are so so good so order an extra side (I unfortunately did not).

We also a red wine which unfortunately, I did not get the name but it was perfect for the meal.

Dessert included their tiramisu and a chocolate gelato dish that apparently was very popular as the other table of 17 people, I counted 7 gelato dishes.

I can't wait to go back and try the carpaccio appetizer, spaghetti all' amatriciana and/or the fetticine alfredo or the vitello alla parmagiana

Based on the prices, there is more of a family celebration or holiday get together or once-a-month a kinda place when you want to put on the dog so to speak.

This is one of the best if not the best Italian places in Calgary or Vancouver for that matter. Comfort food that leaves you feeling satisfied but not bloated

NOTE: this is definitely a good place to take a date that you want to impress!

Mamma mia, here I go again, how can I resist you..."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food. Excellent presentation. Flawless service. I have been for both lunch and dinner, and have always had my expectations exceeded."}
{"text":"Caeser salad average no real flavour, needed anchovies. tortellini in a very liquid consistant bland sauce with a few pieces of broccoli. The decor is cheesy. Will not go back. Waiter was nice and attentive. Go to Abruzzo"}
{"text":"Angel hair excellent, caprese 3/5, bun 2.5/5, house wines 3.5/5

Service was a little slow but only 1 staff for 25 customers At 1:30 pm and she had to make all the cappuccino s

I would go back even though prices were a little high for lunch ie $18 pasta"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful and quite Italian inspired Restaurant. Pronounce as \"Kyan-Ti\" Their music reminds me of Pavarotti.  Best for groups or if you want to spend quality time with your loved ones this place is good for you. Why a 4 star? The sound of pounding the veal makes it less a star. At first I thought there was some kind of constructions going on, but over all ambience is good. Table cloth and napkins looks like a wedding set up. Food is great and the wines as well. You may like to try their  Scaloppinne Alla Chianti or better ask their day specials."}
{"text":"I have been going to II Chianti for over 7 years now. And each time I go, the food is always delicious, generous portions, plenty of options on the menu and always attentive service. The small Italian Owned family operated restaurant is Clean, Old school DÃ©cor with fancy paintings, Gaudy chandlers imported from Italy and A memorable painting of a funny looking man wearing wino....

Speaking of  Wino the wine selection is top notch 10/10. I always order the Caesar Salad (with home made Anchovy dressing), followed by Spaghetti and Tomato sauce... sure my choice may sound simple but the complexity and love they put into their sauces are out of this world. Your dishes feel like your in Italy and tingles your senses. No Tomato Sauce seems to compare to II Chianti's.

Aside from the food's perfection, II Chianti's is fine dining (casual clothes okay), you really get the prime services- leaving you to feel like your a star or someone important with the appointed detail in service. Just a side note - The dishes are expensive, so prepare to dig deep into the wallet!"}
{"text":"Small but clean bright and elegant restaurant next to an Italian supermarket, which is a good first sign!
The Staff are of Italian origin so they know what they are talking about!

Food is well portioned and nicely presented, my friends had pasta dishes which looked and tasted v good, I had the Bistecca something with a brandy sauce, very good steak!"}
{"text":"Friday night dinner with family and friends (one of whom was celebrating a birthday) consisted of fresh rolls, bruschetta, Caesar salad, Chicken Parmigiana, and assorted pastas (gnocchi, penne, angel hair) served family style, finished with panna cotta and tiramisu (regular and pumpkin). Food was delicious, service was graciously attentive, newly renovated interior is elegant and contemporary. Great for entertaining groups, family special occasions, and romantic dates. Small, so make reservations."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We had to practically chase the waiter/the manager around to get more drinks, because they took our glasses away and didn't bother to ask if we needed more to drink; they weren't paying attention to our table at all at any point of our visit. And if this wasn't bad enough, around closing time, who we believe to be the manager walked by our table and asked with a very sarcastic tone \"are you ladies planning on sleeping here tonight?\" and kept walking. If they wanted us to leave she could have politely say \"sorry ladies but we're about to close pretty soon\". This would have been enough; there was no need for the snarky rude comment. Not going back for sure."}
{"text":"Service was very professional and tasteful. The food was delicious but very pricey! The food menu was limited and was difficult to find something appealing to try. Overall an okay experience. 

We wouldn't go again."}
