{"text":"Let me start by saying this was our first visit. We went for lunch on a Saturday & left wanting to come back. We even talked about trying it for dinner maybe this Friday. Wish we knew about it sooner! The waitress Kim was so sweet & friendly. We got pretzels for an appetizer (my hubby's suggestion) & they were perfect! I know...how can pretzels be so good BUT...they were! The mustard dipping sauce is delicious too. Everything we ate we enjoyed & they have craft beer too. Definitely going back! 
Please continue reading....the 5 stars are now a 3. 
We've returned & they changed the menu! Only 2 pretzels not 3 & they were out of them. The waitress was clueless & the people at the bar were singing loudly non stop. Couldn't leave fast enough. 

Ok...we gave it one more chance, but when we walked in they made us feel like we were intruding on a private party. They were setting up for some event that evening & were preoccupied to say the least. We got the pretzels this time, but the dipping sauce was mustard from a bottle for sure, not the original mustard we got the first time. They didn't have any craft beer & the meals were not good. Did they change cooks, new management? Who knows but we won't go back. So the 3 stars become 1."}
{"text":"We got mixed up and came tonight even though Shag Dancing begins again on 1/10/18.  But I was still happy, because the food here is the best. You should come on Wednesday night to Carolina Shag and eat good food. (But any time is good for the best eating in Concord!)"}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived close to 7pm. We were greeted by our host/waiter, who told us to sit anywhere. There were two large groups of people, probably close to 20 in each party already seated and eating. They were eating off the buffet. We then order the spinach dip, which was good, but took 45 minutes to get to our table. By this time the noise coming from one of the large groups, mixed with the loud music coming from the bar area was a little more than unwelcoming. This continued through our meal, which took an additional 45 minutes to get. I had pasta and my husb had fish tacos, no complaints about the food at all, but was it worth the wait and the noise, NO. The atmosphere was a complete disappointment and we probably won't return."}
{"text":"We did a yelp search after our son's graduation at the Cabarrus Arena to find a quick meal. What a great find!  Everyone from the bartender, host, chef and server were super accommodating. We ordered several appetizers and a few salads and wraps. Everything was tasty and just what we were looking for. The staff seriously could not be nicer!  We will return."}
{"text":"We went when there was a wedding happening which was strange since it was the middle of the day and no warnings. The servers were distracted and the food was just ok. I may give it another try and hopefully won't be front in center of another wedding."}
{"text":"Went for a comedy show. There was no link I found to the show, I called and was informed I could pay over the phone for 8 or 10 at the door by the owner. I wasn't sure how this would play out, so I paid over the phone to ensure we would have a seat. First of all, it's seating where you like. Couldn't tell you our waiter name (probably on the receipts, she didn't bring it back guess she thought I wouldn't recognize. I used my phone to figure the tip), it was so loud from the music. First drink, sex on the beach tasted like juice. I opted for my usually margarita, it was good. I ordered the Cajun pasta with chicken and veggies, I liked it. CONS: I was charged 10 instead of 8 (didn't complain this time, no biggie), our waitress was all over the place, not sure if that's how they operate need a better laid out plan for who handles what tables, when my change came it was less the coins (again is probably why she didn't bring the receipt back, I remember faces not names so I'll know next time). So I gather this is the norm in this establishment with skimming off the top. Would I go again? Possibly but I would be less forgiving next time."}
{"text":"We'd heard some really good things about this restaurant and today they didn't disappoint! I had the black bean burger & Mac and cheese. I'm speechless! The black bean burger was amazing, smothered with onions & peppers, lettuce, tomato and some special sauce. The menu has plenty of options to choose from. They have lives music & comedians. This is one of the best kept secrets in Concord! If you get a chance go check them out!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and have not been disappointed.  Good food and good people. Seriously the friendliest service anywhere. I love the stuffed crab appetizer and my husband loves the surf and turf entree. We went for Sunday brunch and had the all-you-can-eat buffet and paid the extra $5 for crab legs. I'm not usually a fan of buffets, but this is a great one-don't skip the shrimp and grits! Not a fancy place, but if you're looking for great food, good prices, and great service, this is your spot!  Before going, check their Facebook page.  They have a lot of events (bands, shaggers,comedy shows), so you may want to avoid going on those nights if you're wanting a low-key dinner."}
{"text":"Food was ok..probably not worth  the prices..pita burger with fries and 2 draft beers for $18 @lunch"}
{"text":"We need a conversation peace in Charlotte too!!!!!! The food is amazing, the drinks are not watered down, the service was fast and courteous, the entertainment was entertaining!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food. We had the fried fish, the flatbread chicken pizza and the blackened fish tacos... all outstanding. The fish tacos had a really good tasty sauce on it. All seems to be made fresh and tasted fresh. It was a Tuesday night and the place was hopping. Trivia and $2 tap beer seems to be a draw. It was comfortable and I think they are still working on the d√©cor, as it was a bit plain.. but I am sure that the ambiance will be improved on. Most important thing is the food is good and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and very upset. We came around 930pm on Thursday. The music was so LOUD we could not hear each other at the table. This was SUPER loud and we HATED our meal and food. We asked the waitress if they could lower the music she stated no they are on their own system and is always loud. I did a lot of research prior coming to this restaurant. I will advise anyone to stay away....."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD.....good prices, everyone was warm and friendly... music was awesome!!!! We felt like we were at home.....the whole group from the hostesses, DJ, waitress. And at the end of meal the chef stopped by to see how we enjoyed our meal. What service"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. Jambalaya was loaded with shrimp and andouille sausage. The chicken piccata looked good and I was told it was delicious. I would have given it 5 stars but for 2 reasons the atmosphere and the price of a mixed drink. Huge menu with something for everyone.  It needs some softening up with plants and pictures."}
{"text":"I live in Kannapolis and just found this place today and I'm so impressed with the food, service and the ambiance.  I had avocados stuffed with shrimp and REAL crab it was delicious and so refreshing.  They have live music and also have comedy shows. I will be back"}
{"text":"The only conversation we'll be having with anyone about this restaurant is how unhappy we were with this place. The reviews were good, the food sounded excellent on the menu, and we're generally pretty easy to please. We were promptly seated and we immediately ordered our drinks and an appetizer (we had looked at the menu online before we came and knew we wanted to order the pretzels). 

The server brought our drinks and walked away. Never brought us napkins, silverware, or appetizer plates. After about 20 minutes, someone came out from the kitchen and brought us our pretzels and nothing else. Still didn't have silverware, napkins, or plates. When I say there was no one else in the restaurant, I mean there was no one! No other customers except for maybe two people at the bar being taken care of by the bartender. So it's not like our server had other tables he was in the weeds with or taking care of or anything. It was only us. I had to get up and get us some paper napkins I saw on a counter by the bar, just so we had something to eat off of other than the table, as well as something to wipe our hands with. Our server came out of the kitchen but still didn't come by our table for another 10 minutes, which by then we were done with our appetizer that we had eaten off of napkins and had decided not to order dinner as we had planned to initially. If it had taken about 35 minutes by now just to get drinks and pretzels, we didn't want to think about how much longer it would be for burgers, etc. 

Finally he came to the table and asked if we were ready to order. Instead, we asked for our check and gave him our debit card to take with him. He promptly returned that, surprisingly. I am always a 20% or more tipper because I used to be a waiter and bartender for many years. This was one of maybe a handful or less times that I gave a 10% tip. It was directly reflective of the service, or lack thereof, we received. I felt 10% to be generous in this case, but I just can't bring myself to tip lower than that. 

All that being said, the homemade pretzels and beer cheese we ordered were delicious. Not worth going back for though. Won't give this place another try. Unfortunate because the food seems to be promising."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for food and live entertainment, including a comedy every first Friday of the month.  Patrons have the opportunity to see a live show with comedians from all around the world while they dine on fine cuisine! 
The menu ranges from fresh fish, to tender beef and even vegetarian dishes! Everything on the menu is delicious! 

The owners and staff are welcoming and very attentive to the customers. 
Great local spot!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I enjoyed this place.  Tucked right away in Concord the food, the music, the venue is so much more than I expected.  

By way of New York City  I am conditioned for a night of live comedy to be expensive with their two drink minimum and no appetizers under $15, and a line to get in the place.  

This place was a refreshing change.  Good comedy and even better food for a fraction of what you would expect to pay.  The single issue I had is that we could not hear the comic at one point over the crowd.  Due to that we missed a good portion of the show.

The bathrooms are clean, the staff is friendly and attentive.  The crowd is diverse and pleasant.  The music is fun and again...  Did I mention the food?  Pub grub it is NOT.  So I will mention it here again, because I had the very best Turkey Burger of my life last night.  I can hear it calling to me now.

So I gotta go, maybe I will see you there on a comedy Friday night soon."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and had the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta. I really liked the dish. It was creamy and had that hint of jambalaya flavor. It wasn't spicy at all (I would prefer if it were more spicy, but hey, it's Concord!) It was missing the andouille sausage, but the chicken and shrimp were plentiful. My girlfriend had spicy bbq wings and really enjoyed them. Her son had the corn dogs from the kids menu. I was impressed by the corn dogs! They were hand battered and fried. I didn't try them but they looked really good!  

The service was exceptional. The server interacted with my girlfriend's son, was super friendly and very attentive to our needs. We were given a free dessert for the boy because the chef accidentally dropped his corn dogs and it took longer for them to come out. That's excellent customer service!

I subtracted one star for lack of decor/ambiance, but it looks like they are working on more decoration. it could use some more flair. :) This will not deter me from coming here again. I plan to come back one evening and check out the night life. It's really awesome to have another place on this side of Concord to eat and drink!"}
