{"text":"I was looking forward to going here because my cousin was raving about it. However, i was very dissapointed by the time I left...
We did not enjoy her smart A*S remarks.
and the food..goodness
The \"Cookie Monster\" crepe was garbage. The crepe tasted like something that was bought from Metro, if not worse. It was very hard..you can tell it was not fresh. Ice cream ..let's just say that..it was the worse ice cream we tasted. 
my funnel cake was below average. I had my share of funnel cakes in the past..and this is nothing special at all. 
& my cousins was pretty disappointed by her funky banana. 

I guess the only good part was my other cousins ice cream. 
I think it was called bear paw...or something like that. It had raspberry ribbons and white chocolate in it. I wished I ordered that instead. Beats the crepe and funnel cake any day. 

All in all, NEVER AGAIN am I going there. CAFE DEMETRES ALL THE WAY!!!!BEST DESSERT PLACE EVER! This is NOTHING compared to them."}
{"text":"The service was kind of slow but the staff was great, kind and attentive to our needs. I think my server's name was Liang (cute girl). She would consistently and constantly address my table to reassure me if I was doing okay and if I needed anything else (this is what i call over-service, but it was a royal treatment and it felt very nice).
It was my first time having such a savory waffle in sooo long and it was better then I expected , almost out of this world! This place has great desserts ranging from crepes, waffles, ice cream and funnel cakes! I would definetly recommend this place (and also the Not Just Vanilla Waffle! hehe)
I was very pleased with the quality of the food, the freshness, and the friendly service. I will definitely be back again. Thanks for the great desserts!"}
{"text":"Fun L Fun was very expensive, as  a student, it was very pricey, 
ever since it closed down and i was a little depressed becuase i missed their dessert, but i realized that the tea shop 168 sells bubble tea and the desserts from FunLfun. 

I just thought i should inform people, just in case they were disappointed like me."}
{"text":"Fun L Fun was really good. I normally avoid sweets but decided to indulge in the funnel battered banana dessert. It was so delishes and heaven to my taste buds.

The server was really great but the ambiance wasn't too fabulous. For ambiance I prefer Demetre's and for this heavenly dessert... Definitely Fun L Fun.

I might try the other location next time as it has a more calm and neutral appearance. Either location is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"A breakfast update:

So we decided to try FLF in the morning hours this time instead of midnight. I chose the traditional eggs benadict and the girl opted for the salmon omelette wrapped in a crepe (pics included). Once again a lot of time was spent on presenting the food in a new and trendy way. Long rectangular plates and fancy cut fruit on the plate tried to give the impression of being hip. Getting past the fact that when I'm hungry I don't really care how the food looks, I discovered that the meal was very tasty. Everything was good well and nothing came out burnt or problematic. Serving time was roughly 11 minutes from the point of order entering on the computer until plates in front of us. Pretty good breakfast in the morning, but we definitely could have used a little more food on our plates in the end."}
