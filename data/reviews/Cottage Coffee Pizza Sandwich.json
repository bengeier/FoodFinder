{"text":"Food is really average and over priced. 
Been there twice with my wife. Had their sandwich the first time and pizza the second time. It was a disappointment at both visits. 

Oven baked fries are actually pathetic. They were really dry and tasteless. Price of $9 for something like this is criminal in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best Persian style pizza and hamburgers in Toronto area. I go to this place regularly and the quality is always the same."}
{"text":"finally a legit pizza, total gem, super cheesy stretch, loaded feesh toppings, most fluffiest crust i ever had"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why yelp saying your comment is too short!"}
{"text":"I ate here today it was a little pricy and the burger was dry I will not be going back"}
{"text":"This is the best Iranian style pizza I so far tried in Toronto and has great selection of sandwiches with nicely toasted breads. Plus Ali, the owner,  is supper nice. Great for takeouts thigh there are few tables in the store.  The only problem is it is just to far from my home."}
{"text":"Very nice customer service the man working on the front desk took our order even though it was 5 minutes past their closing time! The Persian Pizza was definitely the best i've ever had in Toronto and ingredients were fresh."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I would give them 0 star. my order at this restaurant is pretty clear: Veggie Pizza. I remember back in the day their pizza was not bad compare to other Persian pizza places. but the past four times that i ordered made me come here and leave a review. 
1- nothing on the pizza was fresh except tomato slices which they couldn't avoid using fresh ones.
2- I specifically ask for no onion and the last time had tons on it. 
3- the dough wasn't baked properly since the toppings were about to burn. (remember all toppings come right out of cans)
4- we got there to pick up the pizza and the cashier was clearly avoiding us doing something else even though the pizza was right infront of us to be paid for.
I hope the owner gets my review and bring a more upscale attitude into his/her business."}
