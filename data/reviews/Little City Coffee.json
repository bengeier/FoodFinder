{"text":"A welcome break from convenience store coffee and the plethora of bars that constitute Mon City's social scene.  This quaint coffee shop offers good coffee, a small menu, a warm fireplace, and a host of interesting evening activities throughout the month.  Next up, dancing (?!).  Give it a try."}
{"text":"I guarantee you that you will not find better coffee then at My Coffee Shop. This is a hidden treasure in the Mon Valley.  It is honestly so good that I chose the location of my business based on proximity to this coffee shop. I am a vegetarian and I order lunch from here multiple times a week. The owner always makes me something different and unique and it is always delicious and satisfying!  I really can't recommend this place more highly!"}
{"text":"Love it everytime I'm in town I stop by great place great coffee what more could you ask for"}
{"text":"Little City Coffee is easily one of the best small businesses in the valley. Food/drink is fairly priced and it has a very welcoming atmosphere. Great place to meet a friend or do some studying."}
{"text":"Little City Coffee is a great, relaxing coffee shop. We typically stop by after making a trip to Triple B Farms; a warm cup of coffee is perfect after a morning of apple picking and Fall Fest-ing! They have a bunch of books and board games as well. Most recently, my boyfriend and I got a S'mores latte & cup of coffee, and started a puzzle. Both drinks were great and the puzzle was super enjoyable. They also do very nice latte art, which you can also find on their social media."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is warm and inviting.  The service is great.  This place puts Starbucks to shame.  They sell freshly roasted coffee, snacks, tea, smoothies, lattes, and other hot drinks.  The shop is decorated with a eclectic style.  It is a great place to meet a friend or work on your laptop with the free wifi."}
{"text":"They have great coffee and decor a cool place to go and hang out. Its a nice little hidden gem in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time. The staff was really nice.  I ordered a cappuccino and a white chocolate frappe. Both were made to perfection and were enjoyed on the nice leather couches. The interior makes you feel welcome and at home.

10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great coffee. If you're used to Starbucks, make sure you order Starbucks style for the specialty drinks."}
