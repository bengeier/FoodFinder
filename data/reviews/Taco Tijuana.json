{"text":"Hmmm... I wonder if our idiot neighbor is stalking us and knows we just ate at taco tijuana - s/he is currently blasting marriachi music in a bizarre coincidence considering where we just ate... at least it isn't heavy metal....

So onto the resto review:

Funky small and colourful. ... enjoyed the kitschy art adorning the walls. 

We did have to wait about 20 minutes for round one (but we expected this wait based on other reviews and went when we had time) but our patience was rewarded with seriously loaded taco on soft tortilla. There are in fact 2 torrillas underneath the fresh pile of yummy.. and we found that splitting the contents between the 2 shells made them easier to eat with our hands (mmmmm).

All tacos come served on two (stacked) soft tortillas with fresh avocado, salsa verdi, (onions), and cilantro on top of the main filling. We tried the sausage with cheese, fish, pork and lamb tacos. Having read they can be a little heavy handed on cilantro and onion- I had mine without onion. They did use lots of cilantro - but I love cilantro so it didn't bother me. 

 The fish was nicely deep fried and crispy and the texture was a nice counterpoint to the softness of the taco, avocado and salsa Verdi on top. The lamb was super yummy... flavorful without being over salted or too spicy. (Actually it is refreshing to note that none of the tacos were over salted.) I seriously liked the pork - small chunk instead of ground with nice caramelized brown bits and slightly sweet finish. The cheese and sausage one had gooey melted cheese and a nice ground sausage. 

You can tell these are assembled fresh on order.... a little slow? Maybe. But worth it. This isn't Taco*barf*Bell.

Price  (about 3 bucks per taco) versus quality is what gives this place 5 out of 5 for us... despite the (some-might-find-it-a-tad-slowish) inital service of the first round. We did appreciated the fact that they served the tacos in 2 courses instead of all at once. They were perfectly hot this way and not soggy in the least... so Rosa, our waitress, gets bonus points for that. She tried hard to please despite being a little rushed at times. 

 We WADDLED home quite full... having consumed 4 tacos and 2 cokes  (love the bottled soft drinks... no soda fountains here) between 2 of us. Next time we will skip the second coke since we didn't finish both (and which is actually almost the price of a taco) and will consider having 3 tacos between us. Add the tip in it will be less than 20 bucks for 2 people. Not a bad price for something fresh tasty and filling.

Yep we will be back."}
{"text":"These tacos are the real deal - full of flavour, and huge! Very inexpensive, but not short on quality. I got two - one would have been enough, but I had to finish them... I took mine to go, and they got a bit soggy, would definitely eat there next time. Best I've had in town so far."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos for 5$! No complaints there! 
My favourite tacos are the spicy pork and the steak. Never doubt homemade tacos"}
{"text":"Best tacos, hands down. I have never tasted something so addictive, so tasty, that it keeps me coming back on a bi-monthly basis. The flavours are authentic, the menu is simple but has variety, and there's Mexican flair all over the place. 
It's run by probably the nicest people you'll ever meet, and the prices are unbeatable, especially for the amount you get. You'll regret not trying this place if you're in town or in the neighbourhood. Easily accessible from all parts of the city (and off-island). There is not a single thing wrong with Tacos Tijuana!"}
{"text":"Food is really good but I got pissed off when the lady refused to serve me tap water and wanted to sell me bottled water only. I've never seen that anywhere else.
Also another time we asked for two soda bottles and she brought three instead, already opened so we couldn't return them. Of course we had to pay, $3 (!!!!) per bottle. 
I love the food but I won't be returning due to the crappy customer service."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos in the city, 2 tacos will fill you up and you might pass out from the itis. I suggest you call for a take out order because they are alway busy due to popularity in the area."}
{"text":"Taste is delicious. Much more flavourful and portions of protein are at least 2x that of La Matraca. (A bit spicy -- ask for no salsa or on the side if your tolerance is low) 

Although you can order single tacos, you'll probably want 2-4 (depending on if this is lunch/dinner). I can eat 3 for dinner (and be right on the edge before full-on stuffed) and my husband can eat 4. Prices are more than other taco places though, at about $3.50 per taco. (In contrast to La Matraca which is about $8 for 3 I believe). But because the portions are much more generous here, we might actually end up spending less because we need less tacos to fill us up. I recall typically eating 4 tacos and half a sandwich at La Matraca for dinner...

But.... Service is very slow and the business is fairly disorganized. We waited ~30 min for 5 tacos and were told to-go orders are also capped at 6 tacos. I think there were only 2 employees there --one person manning the counter/serving/bus service, and one person in the back cooking/grilling. 

Definitely worth a spin for taste alone... Just plan a bit more time in your day for it since it may take awhile."}
{"text":"A really delicious taco spot! I had the pork and the fish tacos and for 7$ it was a super filling lunch! 

The menu is simple and incredibly affordable. 

The pork tacos were completely on point but the fish tacos lacked a bit of salt and the limes served on the side were incredibly hard to press. 

The waiting time was also super long for 2 tacos (about 15 mins) but you can taste the time and dedication that went into your food."}
{"text":"I've driven by Taco Tijuana many times but finally stopped in today. I parked my car (got a spot right in front, woo hoo!!) but my joy quickly shifted as I approached the door, only to see a sign that said (back in 20 minutes)
I was confused because the place was busy and I have never been to a restaurant and experienced this type of situation before.


I walk back to my car and decided to drive over to Mr Pattie to get a chicken roti but I got there and realized I only had my debit card and they only accept cash!! Grrrr!

I took this as a sign that I was really meant to have tacos, so I drove back to Taco Tijuana.

The door was sign free this time:) and there was a bit of a line up.

The place itself is very tiny, a few tables inside and a few infront,  if you are inclined to eat outside. Minimal decor, bright purple wall, lots of prints with a Mexicana feel, 2 giant , colorful pinatas (sp?) hanging on the wall for sale with Spanish music playing in the background. 

I placed my order, 1 chicken, 1 pork and 1 beef taco to go, oblivious to the size these suckers are, they were stuffed full of fillings and 1 would have been plenty.

The wait was about 20 minutes so I went outside to wait, a girl was busy screaming on the phone to someone who's dad did her wrong, which kept me entertained.

I finally get my bag of goodies and headed home with the smell charred meat wafting through the air.

In a nutshell: the pork was truly delicious, crispy bits, tender morsels, smoky, spicy and all around amazing, my favorite of the 3. All of these tacos are served the same way, a mix of grated onion, tons of cilantro and chunks of avocado and cheese. 

The beef was a close second but I will definitely pass on the chicken. It was dry and stringy, not a favorite.

It was worth waiting for, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The tacos are all good. Love the vegetarian tacos as much as the meaty ones. Be prepared to wait because it is a really busy place! Worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. I really don't understand any of the bad reviews that talk about the taste. Those people obviously expected a fake taco like those things you see Western people that have no idea what they're doing make, but these taste amazing. Super cheap and they fill you up. My favorite place in the neighbourhood. I agree that the opening hours aren't clear though, sometimes I pop by when it's supposed to be open and it isn't. Would still recommend, 10/10."}
{"text":"Yes, you absolutely need to visit this establishment if you're craving some tacos! 

Just be weary that there are not to many tables, so plan accordingly if you're a big party."}
{"text":"Great little hole-in-the-wall kinda spot, the tacos are delicious (and since it's all they serve, you'd expect them to be!)

I've eaten here about 6 times and for me the steak & sausage (or just steak, but why opt out of sausage, amirite?), vegetarian and fish tacos were the best (note: battered fish). I'd personally stay away from the chicken, it's totally fine but not as good as the others. I haven't tried the pork yet, but I will on my next visit.

These are not the tiny little tacos you may've gotten elsewhere... one is enough for one person, two if you're very, very hungry. I often go with a friend and share 3 different flavours together: 1.5 tacos each is a nice big meal and you get to try different ones :)

You can't argue with their low price point, very reasonable and great to take out so you can eat them in a park in the summer or take them home to have with a cold lager (they don't serve alcohol). They have an array of Mexican colas (including Mexican coke which is apparently prized among those who care about soda for being sweetened with sugar and not high fructose corn syrup like US coke.)

Pro tip: the tacos usually have a second tortilla underneath, ask for this one separately as they get very soggy from all the ingredients. Whether you're taking them out or staying in, it's much more convenient to have the second tortilla(s) on the side so it doesn't get soggy & helps you scoop up all the deliciousness :D"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Montreal. Truly authentic, quick and affordable! The tacos are only 5$ each (now they have shrimp for 6$). Every taco is piled high with lots of meat, toppings and sauce on top of two corn tortillas. It's practically 2 tacos!! Best to accompany it with some jarritos drink. Fruit punch goes well. Mmm. This is unlike the overpriced mexican restaurants who charges +15$ for 3 tacos with barely anything in them.

I tried the shrimp for the first time and it was very flavourful with a generous amount of shrimp but overcooked so it was ok. Still, my favourite is the beef and vege. They use to have pork which was even better, but sadly they took it off the menu. Also I wish they had hotter hot sauces, I find their sauce is very mild and I'm the type to find food boring unless spicy! (I just bring my own hot sauce now ha). Also, just a warning, there are no washrooms. It is really an in and out spot. 

Despite my criticism, it is still a 5 star since it's the best compared to anywhere else. Service is always fast (max 10 min) and great as we are welcomed by the same lady. I always find myself coming back every week or two."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this taco place and was drawn immediately by the decor. This place has wall to wall colorful art to look at. They were closing at 10pm so I had 15 mins to make my order. I was lucky to get in just in time and ordered the fish tacos with a mango Jarritos soda. Full of flavor, lots of cilantro and just enough spice. This taco is huge and super filling. It must be eaten with utensils due to the size and filling. I'll definitely be back for more. Very affordable especially on a budget. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because there is no alcohol. Beer would pair great with this meal."}
{"text":"For Montreal, this place is a 5 outta 5.  I am a native (southern) Californian.  So I known way around authentic Mexican food.  And this place is legit.  He tacos are HUGE !  And burritos?  They are more like BURROs massive!  Big enough for three meals.  Spicy too!  I love this place!  

Not much in the way of seating so get it and go!"}
{"text":"Délicieux et abordable. Pour des tacos au chorizo ou même les traditionnels tacos au poisson. Goût, excellent service. Mon nouveau spot"}
{"text":"Dishonest & Dirty. My friends and I placed a takeout order for 8 people. We arrived to pick up  our order and were asked to pay before the order was complete - no problem. We threw the change in the tip jar and chaos ensued. The woman immediately went into the back for a minute before emerging with the chef, \"Do you know how many tacos you ordered?\" he said. \"A lot?\" said the friend I brought with me to pick up the order, thinking nothing was wrong. \"You tipped 50 cents on the order\", the man barked. My friend stood shocked and innocent, contemplating whether the change she tossed into the jar was sufficient. After cussing out my friend, with a rye smile on his face he turned back into the kitchen and closed the door behind him to \"complete the order\". At this point it was clear to all parties that that the food was about to come out -ahem, less than sanitary. At this point we asked for our money back but the cashier refused and went back into the kitchen to tell the chef. He came out with a vengeance, insinuating with his body language that we should be intimidated. Admittedly, I lost my cool and shouted back, which went nowhere. In the end they refused to give us our money back and we left, vowing never to go back. We threw the food that we received post-argument in the trash and that was that. I should also note that in the midst of this chaos a couple walked in and immediately recognizing the situation remarked that they had seen this issue at this place before and wouldn't come anymore - reassuring us that we  weren't the first to experience this harassment. Make sure you're not the next."}
{"text":"So ... I've been eating a lot of tacos lately and I think that I'm probably ... ya ... definitely I'm addicted to tacos now. Hello, my name is Taco. I like tacos. I eat tacos because of the taste in my taco that happens tacos I put the tacos inside of me and my tacos tacos tacos tacos forever. 

These tacos are the real deal (Evander) Holyfield. Gigantesco is the Spanish word for gigantic and that is just what comes to mind when describing these tacos. This is one big and beautiful taco. Her juices cascade down my mouth to my beard; she gets everywhere. All over my face and hands. Coriander is cilantro and the air is heavy with it; that heady green aroma envelops my frijoles. That means beans and beans ain't fuckin' around. The smoke and heat of sultry chipotle invites your tastebuds to stay for a while. Take a dip because the water is just fine. Tacos Tijuana promises a lot ... and it delivers. This is a very East L.A. sort of a place. They've got piñatas for sale as well as Jaritos soda. Go here with Rebecca and feast on tacos ... whilst the two young lovers gazed knowingly into each other (dipping one mind into the mind of the other ... two solitudes sharing space and time and mind in a vast abyss) ... they carelessly share an authentic one half litre glass bottle of Mexican Coca~Cola made with real sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup. And that's a good thing, opined the felon Martha Stewart. Two giant tacos for eight dollars and you'll eat like Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias for a week. Anyway, Mexico got independence from Spain a long time ago so ... that doesn't really work but whatever. Just go eat tacos and maybe I'll see you then. Comer en paz con las vibraciones esotéricas del cosmos."}
{"text":"Portions are HUGE, in a bad way. Like it's not well balanced; too much meat and not enough of the rest. guacamole was bland-ish. Good value though; one and a half taco is good enough for one adult male."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Cheap authentic very tasty.  Lunch for under $5.00 (sept 2015).
Especially recomend the fish taco.  Mexican soft drinks, try once.
Closed Sundays,  and sometimes monday."}
{"text":"Post shopping, we were super hungry. So we walk into this very small resto with very short menu. I ordered the chicken taco, with Spanish sangria. When I tell you... believe best taco in my life. It felt authentic. It was spicy, but it was hitting right spot. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place has made me so sad.
We started going a year ago after they first opened.
Their stuff was fabulous - cheap, fresh, full of guacamole, tomatoes, fresh herbs, etc.
The service was always terrible - the same very overwhelmed woman at the cash and just one guy in back who takes 15-30 minutes EVERY SINGLE TIME to make a taco.    But the food we got made that forgivable.

Fast forward one year later - we went tonight and got an order to take out.
We got home and found they screwed up the order and gave us 2 steak instead of 1 steak, 1 chicken.   
On both orders there was: 
1.  Zero guacamole.
2.  Zero fresh vegetables.
3.  Spicy, VERY  overcooked meat that has had a ton of packaged seasoning added to it.
4.  Higher prices than only 1 year ago.
5.  Instead of a ton of fresh herbs there were just a few dried out flakes on top.

This is not the same product they put out just a few short months ago.
What we got completely turned us off from a place we've enjoyed about 10 times, and honestly it's just sad  :-("}
{"text":"For about five dollars a taco, you really can't beat Tacos Tijuana. One is more than enough per person. The fish taco is very fresh and the chorizo has a good balance of flavour and just a bit of fat from the sausage. A great place for a quick and friendly meal."}
{"text":"Hands down best Tacos in Montreal! 

My boyfriend and I first went to this place when it opened and we got hooked! The tacos are HUGE and full of fresh ingredients. You won't be able to eat more than two because of how plentiful they are.

Some reviews state that the service was slow or negative however I have always had an exceptional service. This place has one cook and one waitress so if it is busy, you may wait 15-30 minutes but it's WELL WORTH IT !! Who wants food that's pre-made and has been laying around anyways?!The tacos are made fresh and you won't regret it!!

Tacos Tijuana deserves 10 stars!"}
{"text":"My mouth is salivating just thinking about this place. Best tacos in Montreal, hands down!

Came here w a friend and left happy, daydreaming of Mexico! The tacos are large- one is sufficient for 1person, but it's hard to resist not ordering more! The menu is small but precise. The tacos are piled high w all different flavors, bright and fresh. 

Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall type taco place. You can choose from a few types of meat. The tacos are huge! 2 tacos are more than plenty! 

The tacos are tasty, but not as good as I've had elsewhere in Montreal. 

Basic hole in the wall place, cheap, fills a hole. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"The tacos here are so huge that I can only eat one for dinner, even when I show up hungry. That means my dinner came out to $4 before tip! They advise people that two tacos is a \"generous meal\", which is an understatement. I ordered the vegan taco and was very impressed by how delicious it was. They served it on two corn tortillas with a huge amount of refried beans, guacamole, cilantro, onions, tomatoes, and what seemed like a fermented salsa. Also, lime wedges on the side. 

A few things to note: this place is pretty tiny and very busy, so if you show up during the dinner rush, don't expect to find a seat. The wait time around 6-7pm was 30min+, so it's best to either show up earlier or later, be prepared to wait, or order for pick-up and come back when it's ready. The worker said that while they cook as quickly as they can, the kitchen is small and they can only make a few tacos at a time - so this is not fast food! Also, please be nice to the staff even if you have to wait. Being rude isn't going to make your food come any sooner.

Taco Tijuana has the best tacos I've tasted in the city. Even though I don't live in the neighbourhood, I'm planning on becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Authentic Street taco type place, super cute, the food is simply delicious... Our family definitely loves the food here... Not to mention great fair prices. There's always tons of people coming here to get tacos to go, very busy... Always a good sign. We will be going back over and over."}
{"text":"I went to this place a year ago and it was delicious. But now every time I try to go it's closed. They say they're closed Sunday and Monday however we tried to go on a Thursday and it was closed. Other times before that we tried to go not on a Sunday or Monday and it was closed. I would like to try them again however I can't. I just now tried to call them, Saturday night, they're closed. SMH"}
{"text":"A bunch of goobly goop that tastes the same or rather doesn't taste like anything , steak was burnt, sausage and steak tasted like steak, the taco's were be burnt covered in hot sauce and guacamole type sauce , the one good thing were the authentic Mexican soda drinks. Not sure if this is what authentic did should taste like but I was disappointed regardless."}
{"text":"For 5$ you can get a tasty steak, chicken or pork sausage tacoThe steak taco being my favourite, the meat is of high quality.Get a Jarrito to help put it down and your set.The only downside is the wait time , you might wait 20-30 mins sometimes"}
{"text":"I returned after nearly a year, the woman at the counter was very polite and sweet. The food quite tasty and so filling.

I recommend calling your order in as they are a family business the wait may be 30 minutes or so."}
{"text":"I hate to be a bummer but this place kinda sucks. I've been there now three times (I live close). I kept trying because I wanted to like it. Every time, the meals are just a pile of brown, poorly spiced mush. There are little to no veggies to balance crunch and freshness, and what was there was unnoticeable. There was supposed to be cheese but if there was, I couldn't see it or taste it. To boot, my last meal (the burrito) was, like, two and a half pounds of brown stuff. I'm 6'3\" 220lbs and I don't want to eat that much muddled brown stuff. I got through about 2/3 of it because I paid $18 tip incl for this thing and my mom would kill me if I threw it out. No nachos, no extra sauce, nothing. 

Authentic or not, it's borderline uneatable. The lady told me to eat it out of the foil and to, \"peel it like a banana.\" But it was just a disaster. Guys, I'm sorry. You gotta work more on your flavours and textures and less time on your flashy signs."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you have to take everything into account to realize what an awesome gem it is. 

Taste - All though this isn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, it's still incredibly scrumptious that will make your tastebuds do the Irish gig. Rating - Like when they found the note on that dead body in Con Air. 

Portions - This is where they really shine. Ri-donkey-licous epic. Seriously, we're talking massive portions. Rating - When Darth Vader told Luke he's his daddy. 

Price - Doesn't break the bank, but nothing rant about. Maybe I'm old, and my brain has adjusted for inflation, but that's everyone else's problem. Not mine. Rating - Rosie O'Donnell in a League of their Own. 

When you combine all three pieces you get... the Tri-Force. Now go save Zelda."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a tiny hole in the wall and a real treasure to N.D.G. The soft tacos are super yummy and huge! Only order one unless you're really hungry because you'll only get half way through taco #2. Try the pork or the fish, you'll be really happy. They also have a great variety of Mexican soft drink! The only thing I think could be improved is the amount of cilantro that is put on top of the tacos, it's a little excessive.  Other than that, top notch!!!"}
{"text":"These tacos are delicious and huge! Each one has enough topping for about 4 tacos. Seriously. The steak was lean and soft, the veggie taco was full of refried beans, onions, salad, cream and cilantro. Each taco comes with two tortillas, but they were almost impossible to pick up. Two tacos filled me to the brim! Absolutely satisfying and amazing value at $4.35 each. Tiny place full of people. Friendly fast service. Definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"Very good value, little fuzzy on the flavors. A $5 taco is the size of your stomach and a $13 burrito is big enough for 2 people. The downside was that they were both a little too spicy. Not \"oh man this is hot\" but residual heat enough to cover up flavors, and my +1 isn't a spicy fan so his burrito wasn't super for his taste buds. The value for what you get is definitely there, and we didn't wait long to receive our order. The burrito wasn't packed with rice or beans as filling but rather had a lot of meat when compared to what you would expect, particularly for the size. My suggestion for the business would be to cut down on the spice level or offer a non-spicy option that you are asked about at the time of order. This food would be too spicy for most kids so beware. I love spicy however and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very affordable~about 5$ a taco, and it's a big serving. I only needed one to be satisfied. Not for people who have a low tolerance for spicy!! The service is lackluster but the concept is hardly a restaurant--it's more of a counter/take away service, even though there are tables. The decor is cheeky and a bit kitschy. Good for a quick bite, not so much for a first date."}
{"text":"After devouring an excellent meal next door in under 11 minutes, my friends and I still weren't totally satisfied so we popped in this taco joint to check it out. We ordered a couple of tacos each and a couple of Mexican soft drinks to share. 

Being born and partially raised in Mexico, I naturally asked for the salsas (in Spanish with a Chilango accent) when the lady brought our order. She nervously gave me an unbelievable response: \"we don't prepare our food too spicy here.\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing so I had to confirm:\" you don't have salsa here?\" \"We don't.\"

I don't know if they really don't serve salsas or they ran out and had to use a lame excuse, but that and the fact that they put purple cabbage in their tacos, failed the test...go else where if you want Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"Best tacos EVER! Service is great and so are the prices! It is a little hole in the wall but it adds to the charm"}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of reviews about bad service and I didn't experience that. The woman at the cash was nice. The wait was 10 minutes as she has stated. Maybe because I was there for a takeout? 

The food was good. Real corn tortillas. Huge portions. The amount of steak was enough for 3 tacos in another restaurant. Which explains the second tortilla that they give. Would recommend to take out the tortilla asap so that it doesn't get soaked. I would also recommend to not order the fish tacos as a takeout because it gets soggy by the time you get home/to the office."}
{"text":"Yummm!!! Super juicy. Super Flavorful. It was totally worth the drive to Montreal West. ONE taco is so big,  it's actually 2 tacos (they give you the extra shell to shove the food over). Trust me! You need a fork. It gets messy. *Salivating at the thought of another one*"}
{"text":"I have never had such delicious soft tacos! The ingredients are luscious, fresh and hand prepared! I had a beef and it had lots of beef but also fresh parsley, tomatoes and peppers. 

The service is very friendly and there is also a selection of unique drinks from Mexico! 

Definitely try it because it's MILES ahead of any fast food tacos I've had."}
{"text":"This is a cute little hole in the wall, which with all my experience in eating Mexican is just the way to go. 
This place is adorably small and just so colorful for the size you have the option of five options of either a taco or burrito we ordered 3 tacos each and it was over kill one taco is like two fully stuffed tacos ! For the price very good. I liked the pork and steak fish was meh"}
{"text":"Petite place avec des bons assietes simples mexicains. Yummy. Service gentil. C'est de la bouffe rapide exotique."}
{"text":"We ate there this afternoon for the first time. There's no AC nor fans inside. On a hot day like today (around 40*) it was not fun. There were only four other customers there waiting for their food. It wasn't busy at all, yet we waited for almost half an hour (!!!!!!!!!!!) for four tacos! Unfortunately, the wait was not worth it. We ordered four different tacos: Fish, pork, sausage and stake, and just stake. The fish was the only one that was ok. The steak and pork were just bad. Cute place but too many things that we did not like so obviously, we won't be back."}
