{"text":"Ordered from them online. Absolutely abysmal portions and they forgot two items from the order (which was prepaid - inexcusable). They were dissmissive on the phone and only offered a refund for the items they forgot, refusing to discuss the portion size, quality of the food (bland), or the general inconvenience.  Bad food. Bad customer service. Highly recommend you spend your money elsewhere. I posted pictures of the food if you want to take a look for yourselves"}
{"text":"I really wish I could have liked this place given that it was a new small business and there are few Indonesian restaurants in the city.  However, the experience was disappointing to say the least and probably one of my most confusing dining experiences to date. The menu is limited to begin with and we were surprised when we tried to order and were told that almost half the menu was unavailable that night (we went on at Saturday night, presumably their busiest night of the week). Now I can understand if we were talking about some exotic items that they may have had in limited quantities and ran out of but they were not serving basic menu items like their salad and fried rice (but they offered plenty of steamed rice?!). Confusing. I settled on their veggie spring rolls and chicken curry. I asked if it was possible to make the curry less spicy (as the waitress warned it it was VERY spicy), but again, this was not possible. The spring rolls were fine, but were little more than some glass noodles and diced carrots inside.  The chicken curry was a sad affair-watery, bland without flavour (or salt) and altogether bad. Chopped up uncooked tomatoes and green onions on top with a few chunks of unseasoned chicken? So confused as to what the dish was suppose to be. Another friend also ordered the chicken curry and agreed it was pretty terrible. Salt was not even provided on the tables so I had to ask for this. On the up side, VERY spicy was not very spicy after all. Sadly I don't think this place will be in business for very long given the fierce competition in the area and the lack of effort displayed from our experience."}
{"text":"I am not surprised that Warung has closed after a fairly short period of time at Yonge & Eglinton. Shortly after it opened I went in, despite the uncomfortable seating. The chicken curry was served with a tiny amount of sauce. The chicken pieces were basically bare. I asked the waiter whether I could get a bit more sauce. The reply from the kitchen: \"no\". \"That's how it is supposed to be served\". I was taken aback by this attitude toward a customer. I could not finish the meal and left it. The waiter was somewhat startled by that."}
{"text":"They keep randomly changing their hours. I've dropped-by 6 times at hours when their website said they'd be open and only once got in. The other times they decided to just not open (3x), close for an event or say their kitchen is done for the day. When I finally got a chance to try their food I found it bland and mediocre compared to the other Indonesian places in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's a shame that their opening times are so inconsistent - why are you only open for four hours on a Saturday and closed on a Sunday?   Also, on the quality of the food, it was not \"authentic\" and was very bland - no spices or flavour. Portion sizes are small and all you're getting is a big bowl of plain rice."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's happening here. But things have gone down fast. While service is friendly, there is a complete lack of professionalism to the culinary aspect of things e.g. Dishes still being on the menu but unavailable, inability offer dishes as sides, portion sizes being abysmal etc.   Repeat: may for a lunch special if you work the area, otherwise no."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0  After coming back from Bali not too long ago, I went to try this place to see how it compared.  I only got to try one set meal as they ran out of their signature dishes. I chose the following as part of my set meal:  Salad in Bali Sauce: Skip this one as it was just some slightly pickled green beans and shredded carrots with little to no flavour at all. This was a huge contrast from what I have had in Bali.  Tofu & Tempeh Satay: These were quite tasty and went well with the rice. I quite enjoyed it.  Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce: This was average and could have been better if it was hotter in temperature.   West Sumatra Curried Rendang: The taste does bring back some memories of Bali but it was not as pronounced as some of the local joints I have had there. The beef was underwhelming. Texture was dry and somewhat tough.  The meal itself tasted very homemade. There was a substantial amount of rice relative to the accompanying items which does not reflect the price of the dish, coming in at $12.99. On a good note - service was welcoming, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I almost feel bad giving this place a less-than-glowing review, as it's clearly a small, family-run joint that's a labor of love for all involved. But that's ultimately no excuse for subpar food.  So I showed up around noon on a weekday and the place was empty. I was immediately intrigued by the Set Your Own Meal for $12.99 option, as it seemed a good way to try several offerings at a reasonable price. I ordered:  Fried Potato Patties: The plate came with two of these patties and they were pretty good. Not exactly bursting with flavor, but what little flavor was there was actually quite tasty.  Salad with Peanut Sauce: Again, this was fine. It's a very small amount of salad topped with an extremely subtle peanut sauce. I ate all of it, but I wouldn't say it blew me away.  Eggs in Bali Sauce: Well, that should actually read Egg in Bali Sauce, because I only got one. This was nevertheless the highlight of the meal, as it reminded me a little of a Scotch Egg. The sauce was quite tasty, and the egg inside was cooked perfectly.  West Sumatra Curried Rendang: This was the item I was most excited to try. I've eaten Rendang at a couple of Toronto-area restaurants, and both times I was blown away by how delicious and flavorful the dish was, so I was very excited at the possibility of eating this dish in my neighborhood and for an affordable price. But this was a disaster of almost epic proportions. The sauce was virtually tasteless and the meat was tough and chewy. I was actually surprised by just how awful this item was, and I was shocked that the chef actually had the balls to serve it to me. A new restaurant offering something this lazy and this inedible? There's no excuse for that.  I should mention, too, that the portions of everything were tiny. Literally half the plate was taken up by a big ball of rice, which I obviously was unable to finish.  I hope that my meal was an aberration and that the food here is usually much, much better. I'll never return."}
{"text":"Warung Indonesia D'Eglinton is a newly opened restaurant serving authentic Indonesian dishes. Conveniently located a few minutes away from Eglinton Station. Prices are pretty fair for the portion that you're getting. I dined in, so I can't comment on the portion for take-outs. \"Warung\" means small family-owned business in Indonesia, and that is what Warung Indonesia D'Eglinton is all about. The restaurant owner, Jaya, is very passionate about food and wants to bring forth the taste of Indonesia to the Yonge/Eglinton neighborhood. There aren't that many options when it comes to Indonesian food in Toronto. Out of all the items, I would recommend getting the set value meal for $12.99, as you have the option of 4 items from a set list, and it comes with steamed rice. For my meal, I opted for the chicken curry spring roll, egg in Balinese sauce, signature fried chicken and sweet and sour beef. The fried chicken was fragrant from the flavorful mixture of spices, and it had a nice crispy texture while moist on the inside.   If you're looking for comfort food to warm yourself from the cold, then get the Chicken Curry Stew. I also enjoyed the spiciness of the sweet/sour beef, as there was a nicely balanced flavor in this dish. Both the Coriander Beef Satay & Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce were quite good, and I would order a couple more of those. However, the Balinese Chicken Satay was too salty for my taste, so I would recommend dialing down on the sodium. Overall, Warung Indonesia d'Eglinton is a pretty solid restaurant if you're looking for home-cooked Indonesian cuisine."}
