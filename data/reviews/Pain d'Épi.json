{"text":"This little café is hidden on a street corner. Now that the weather is nice they have tables and chairs outside so it is easier to spot. They have amazing croissants and great unique sandwiches. I love their lattes as well. They have a great and different selection of bread that I have yet to try but always smells great.  The staff is always friendly. Love this hidden gem :)"}
{"text":"Best baguettes and best croissants in town! Delicious selection of breads as well. Not over priced like so many others!"}
{"text":"Nice team, great products, good coffee!
Bonne boulangerie de quartier.
S'ils avaient religieuses au café et mille-feuilles je serais le plus heureux.."}

{"text":"Quaint little café, subtly located on a street corner, so simple we passed by it a few times and never noticed it until a couple of friends pointed at it one Thursday afternoon.

During our visit at Pain d'Épi café and bakery, we received a good service from an amicable barrista. The mochaccino I ordered was satisfactory and, although I did not personally taste their bread, a trustworthy friend of mine assured me their baguettes were great. I'll have to go back and taste it for myself next time!

The place itself is small and humble but welcoming, a nice and simple little coffee shop slash bakery to try if you are in the area."}
