{"text":"I am from Solon and am constantly trying new restaurants that come to the area. The restaurant had a great atmosphere and great server, however, we had 6:15 reservations and didn't get seated until about 6:35. The wine was great, however the bruschetta was rock hard. We ordered all of our food at once because we knew the kitchen would be slow. Not only did it take a long time to get our food, but my parents entrees came out 10-15 minutes before mine so they were basically done when I was just getting my food. Thankfully the manager took my entree of the bill because he felt sorry, so that was nice. The food however was very bland. I got a veal scaloppini, which on the menu said \"mushrooms, lemon caper sauce, \"buttered noodles\". There was hardly (if any) lemon caper sauce and there was a bunch of cheese baked onto the veal. It did not say on the menu that there would be cheese, so if you have a dairy allergy, either specify upon ordering, or just don't get it. On top of that, the meal was very expensive and not worth the price at all. The only great items I had were the wine and the tomato bisque soup. I will not be going back for a while. Im sticking to M Italian and the Burntwood Tavern in Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"Still too young. I was hoping that this restaurant would be great. 

Food was good, but nothing to write home about-similar to all food from restaurants by the same company. Fairly tastless. All the reddish sauces tasted the same. Bland and tomatoey, that's it. 

The server was nice and sweet, but seemed very new. I don't blame her, i blame the manager. He never once checked on her or our table. She forgot our silverware, she did not ask us if we needed more to drink just before or just after our food arrived. As a result we ate without drinks. When she finally got our drink order it took so long that we finished and ended up asking her not to bring the drinks. 

So the restaurant really needs time to mature and refine before i could recommend it."}
{"text":"Pros: nice looking place
Cons:
-Horrible seats. Sat at the booth and it's small and narrow, felt like my ass was falling off the whole time.
- waiter took forever to take our order. Had to get the manager to get someone to take our order.
-Food was not worth the wait. 
-House wine was bad.

Save your time and money. Stay away!"}
{"text":"The one star rating is based on the way I feel after an exhausting, debilitating two hours during an attempted conversional evening over dinner with friends.  

On all the other aspects of the meal, that rating would be a 5.   The restaurant looks hip, welcoming and beautifully designed.  The food that I tasted was all very good with a generous number of offerings for dinner specialties.  The waiter, Thor was knowledgable, polite and efficient.

All my negative feelings are based on the punishing noise level of the restaurant.  From the moment you enter the inviting-looking dining room, the bombardment of sound is an attack on one's nerves.  Humans are only built to endure so much and to be exposed to such a troublesome level of sound at a place of your choice that you are paying for, is inexcusable.  And to add the constant pumped-up musical tracks to the poor acoustics, makes the whole experience brutal.

It is definitely not the type of hospitality an Italian Grandmother would approve of.

I will not be returning unless I sit outside or there is a marked improvement on the acoustical design inside."}
{"text":"Sorry folks but Burntwood Tavern it ain't. Owner really missed an opportunity.  Location is great and has a patio. Bocci nice touch Food misses the bar big time. My sisters shrimp pesto was more like pesto soup and. Wry salty. Calamari was all dough as were the rolls. My husbands veal was dry. Nephew did like his meatball sub. My salad was average at best. Servers were very nice."}
{"text":"Excellent place luved it . Me and my daughter went there for the first time. The setting is very contemporary and very nice and it feels you are at a resort and has a very fresh new look feel to it. The wine and the food selections were amazing. Very authentic Italian food .Everyone is very friendly. Mr Marco / Manager runs the place very well. A special thanks to Nikki who took great care of us. Would most definitely come back. Highly recommend this place. 
Thx

{"text":"Delightful and delicious lunch with my BFF! We were warmly greeted and led by a dancing handsome server to our table on the patio.  Then the super cute \"superman\" Will appeared and made our entire dining experience fun!  In my opinion he was everything you'd want your server to be. From my short time there, everyone stepped up to the plate.  I wish them great success!  #supermanWill##"}
{"text":"Very average and disappointing.  I agree the chairs are awful.  I had chicken Marsala which was a plain chicken with a blob of sauce and mushrooms.  Very plain and salty. Expected more from these owners as I will not return.  Only gave 2 stars as patio was nice."}
{"text":"It was ok, like the atmosphere!  The food was mediocre but may go back and try something else!  Kind of skimpy on the chicken parm, you get a lot more for your buck at Olive Garden!  But will try it again!"}
{"text":"There are still some issues, but the food quality was good enough that I am looking forward to going back again.

We got a reservation for two on a Tuesday night when the kids were at a camp overnight.   We were seated promptly.

The decor is nice, but sort of hodge-podge.  What can you expect, though?  It went from an Applebees to a Mexican place to this.  We sat indoors, in a high-top table near the kitchen.  Not too noisy.  Two biggest issues: (1) Seating--the booth seat was uncomfortable, with a spring poking me in the tush.  And the bar stool at the other side of our table was much higher than the booth, so my wife was looking down at me. (2) Overhead--the HVAC system has leaks.  There are several noticeable stains on the booth upholstery from it. 

Our server (Jenn, I think) was incredibly friendly and attentive.  Either she or the kitchen messed up, though, since the salads came 30 seconds before the entrees.

The food was pretty good.  We split a \"Little Gem\" salad, which was much more interesting than most restaurant salads.  The rolls were delicious, though I would've preferred them with the salad.  My wife god the Salmon Piccata.  She thought it was good, though perhaps too salty.  My Lobster/Shrimp pasta dish was delicious.  Our waitress warned me when I ordered that it was very spicy, and she was correct.  Both entrees were so large that we had leftovers for tomorrow's lunch. We split a \"molten chocolate cake\" for dessert, with some sort of raspberry ice cream on top.  Really good, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Tried Rose again. Thought now that it had been open for awhile it would be better. But not so much. The calamari was beer battered and way too much batter. Not advertised. The calamari at M Italian has a light breading which is way better. 
Hope they change up the menu and make it different from M Italian. Really liked the menu originally advertised which had a choice of protein, pasta and sauce. Not so hard to vary the prep to offer a wider variety. 
Wonder if they will last longer than Pacos Tacos."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this Italian restaurant since it's new in solon but I went there on Thursday night and the wait was over  an hour so I put my name down and I went to drive around for about 30 minutes and I got a text that the table is ready so I came back not even five minutes later and we had to wait another 15 to 20 more minutes and the hostess was very rude so I waited and when were sat down, the waiter came and took our drinks but it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and we ordered appetizers but our apps came at the same time as our entree which I didn't like. Over all the food was great but I get it's just opening but it could use a few fixes."}
{"text":"Mother's Day dinner-
We had such high hopes for this restaurant considering it's affiliation with other local restaurants and we were so disappointed. 

The server was so rude and cocky off the bat. He told us he's been working there for 3 days (already sets the precedence on how the evening will go). He continuously mocked my guest on her choice of water without lemon and her salmon made grilled with only vegetables. He served the incorrect beer to one guest and blamed the bar. When brought to his attention he said, \"well why didn't you tell me?\". A manager overheard and went to find the server to fix the situation. The server came back and said my manager wants to make sure you're satisfied (aka he doesn't care about guest satisfaction, only the manager). 
The food came out cold and so mediocre. I'd rather go to Olive Garden. I had to flag down another server and busser for a refill on iced tea. When the server finally brought it he slammed it on the table. 
The server never once checked on our party asking how the salad and dinner was- another server did ask if we needed refills. When asked for a box and bill, the box was brought back only with the comment, \"this can't actually be happening\" and we never received our bill. 
After calling out a manager to tell him what's going on he nicely picked up the bill and apologized. I will not be returning to this restaurant. 
You can tell the service was terrible for other parties at the restaurant too. I'm not sure if they weren't trained or lied about their restaurant serving experience but it appears as this was their first serving job."}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way, I know it's a brand new restaurant and there's going to be problems, but even for a new restaurant, this was a little too hard to come back from. After we were seated, we waited 15 minutes for a server to come by, who only came by after we grabbed a manager. He didn't really greet us, just went on about how busy he was. We waited another 10 minutes for drinks to arrive and then another 15 for appetizers. For appetizers we got the calamari, which was essentially just balls of breading with a side of squid. I would not order the calamari again. The manager came over and reassured us the food would be out in 10 minutes, but took 20. I ordered the ravioli because I didn't expect a simple dish to be messed up, yet it was. It was smothered in cheese sauce that was too rich, and the ravioli itself was bland. They brought us a round of drinks on the house, which was nice, but I'd rather have the food I waited over an hour for. Honestly, they've got to improve the service and make better tasting food if they want to keep this place open. The atmosphere is nice, but they're using plastic red cups and letting servers walk to their cars in plain sight when their tables aren't being taken care of. I don't plan on returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for this place to open since last year when I read in a local magazine that it was opening in early 2018.  Though there were some issues at the soft opening, it did not disappoint!  I love M Italian, and I'm glad there is a little overlap (like my favorite shrimp noodles) since this is a lot closer to me than M is!  We had a bunch of dishes at the soft opening.  We sat at the bar since reservations were all booked up.  Appetizers came out together and were beautifully presented.

There were 2 major complaints I'd have (need to cut them some slack since they will need to work out any bugs given they hadn't even officially opened yet) is that my entree was covered in a buttery sauce when I told them earlier that I couldn't have dairy.  I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt since it was a special, and the bartender may not have known how it was prepared.  The other issue that I'm sure they will work out quickly is that the entrees came before we finished our appetizers, and my dining companion's entree arrived long after mine.  That turned out ok since he ended up eating mine though.  His beef was also a bit overdone but still tasty.

Note that while Rose also offers happy hour 7 days a week like the sister restaurants M Italian and Burntwood, the sisters offer half off appetizers while Rose only offers a set dollar amount off per dish (I think $3).

A couple things I'd suggest to the restaurant:
- There's no need for the 2 fresh rolls to come in a large paper bag to be torn open table side.  It's a nice show, I guess, but seems awfully wasteful.
- Also maybe don't call the bread garlic knots when they're rolls.
- The plastic red cups for the water don't seem to fit with the overall look of the restaurant.  Honestly they look like cheap cafeteria cups.

Overall, I like the place and of course that is right in my neighborhood.  I think they will do well and hope they stick around for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"In the middle on my thoughts of this place. I had the wedding soup and the Pasta Rose which were both really good but the bread they brought out had a bit too much butter all over it. Restaurant is beautifully designed however very loud inside. Something could be done to correct the sound absorption within the restaurant. Heaters outside could also be a good investment. Service definitely could be improved as well as attire of the staff. The T-shirt's don't exactly match the restaurants vibe and the red water cups do not as well. Hopefully this restaurant can do a few quick fixes to ensure success in that location after a long several years of failure in that spot."}
{"text":"So far so good. The best part of the whole experience is our server, Grace. She has been fantastic, very welcoming, friendly to all three of our kids - almost like we have known her for years.  Ask for grace - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place got a lot of negative feedback first few weeks but my experience was good.  Lunch with co-workers 7 of us.. food was good promptly served we all enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Whenever I review or visit an Italian restaurant, I view it through a certain filter as I lived in Italy for some time. I try not to let it bias my reviews too much. With that being said I ventured into Rose Italian kitchen with an open mind. First off the ambiance and setting of this place is great for a summer day. It has a very nice outside seating. It's very well lit and inviting inside as well. I noticed, as some other  reviewers noted,  Spanish music was playing in the restaurant rather than Italian but I'll give the a pass for the moment... I will say wait staff was very helpful and professional. Great service was received.

Next the menu seemed to be very extensive. Looked great on paper. I order the personal pepperoni pizza. The size was fitting for 1 person. However that's the extent of positives I can say about it. The pizza I found very salty. Also the sauce itself was not bad but it was very limited . I think the pizza could have used a bit more sauce. Due to the lack of sauce, I found the pizza \"dry\". I doubt I'll try the pizza again at this place but I'd potentially try another item from the menu to give it one more shot."}
{"text":"When we first arrived, we were able to sit right away which was nice. However, we waited about 5 minutes until we were offered anything to drink. When she returned with our waters, my date asked what the chef's seasonal special was. They server then gave him attitude, pretending that that item did not exist. She had the manager come over and explain what it was, and she never returned to our table. A different server then took our orders. She did not introduce herself, either. While we were waiting, she was very inattentive and rarely refilled our waters. We did not receive our bread until we asked for it; the bread was drenched in garlic in butter which was very heavy and unappetizing. Our appetizer was good, but we were surprised that we only received four small raviolis for $11. My food (Pasta M) was good but nothing special. My date's food (Pasta Rose), however, only came with 2 small (maybe about 2 inches long) pieces of chicken. Overall, the food was nothing special, the service was terrible, and most of the decor did not fit the theme of the restaurant. This is the worst service I have had in a very long time, and we were very disappointed. M Italian's menu is almost identical, and, while it is a further drive, we will go there instead of Rose."}
{"text":"By far the worst Italian food I've ever eaten. Could be the worst food I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"The service was poor. Server not friendly. Waited a long time to receive our order and no one came to address concern. 
Finally another waitress came and forwarded our concern. Manager brought champagne to make it better. Champagne??

My husband doesn't drink I stated he left it anyway.
Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went for Mother's Day and it was fantastic! The service was amazing and the food  as delicious! Can't wait to go back again :)"}
{"text":"I believe in this spot! This physical location in Solon is tough - it has seen several restaurants over the past few years.

Pros:
+ Pretty decor. Very inviting!
+ They're on OpenTable if you want to make a reservation ahead of time.
+ They seem to have a cute patio if you're looking to enjoy a drink outside.
+ Well-made drinks! A good bartender is hard to find around this area.

Cons:
+ All around us at other tables, their was confusion that guests wanted salad or appetizers BEFORE their entrees. Luckily, I caught our server to double check ours would come beforehand. She had time to correct it, but I thought that was odd.
+ What is the ambiance goal here? For an Italian restaurant, the Spanish music playing was distracting (at some point it did switch over to English, and don't get me wrong, that \"Havana ooh-na-na\" song is catchy, but misplaced here.) Its also really loud.
+ Salt overload on our dishes (especially the chicken marsala). No one came buy to ask how dinner was, and we had already waited for so long and were on a time crunch, so sigh.
+ I agree with Cin P. that the rolls are odd. They give you a GIANT plate for one small roll that comes in a large paper bag which they tear off in front of you. Makes me sad to think of all the paper wasted.
+ Amidst all this pretty decor are giant, plastic red cups that seem more fitted for a fast food joint.
+ Strange layout. We were sat at a high-top table. These tables are way too close to the bar (where the servers also use as a path), and literally every single person that walked by hit my seat or shook the table. It was really uncomfortable.

I'm sad to give any place ever less than 3 stars, but I think these are things that can be corrected. Sadly, I left with no impression of Rose Italian Kitchen, especially for spending $75+ on dinner for two. But know I believe in you, Rose. I would look forward to coming *one* more time to see if it improves but I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Chicken Milanese so salty it was not edible.  Sons carbonara had fake grilled chicken just like M Italian.  Purdue \"short cuts\" when grilled chicken is so easy to make.  And menu changed from original one, which was also a bummer.  Loved the pick your meat and pick your preparation. That was an innovative idea to let the menu appeal to more.  And the Mexican music was a great touch!"}
{"text":"It's wonderful to see a new restaurant in this area . The food was very good service was good. We had a waiting time of 50 mins which was ok for a Thursday night around 630pm. Staff was friendly and very nice. I only gave 4 stars because it was very loud inside and they need benches outside for patrons who are waiting. I will definitely be back to try another delicious dish."}
{"text":"Let me first say that we love \"M Italian\" in Chagrin Falls.  Knowing this was a sister restaurant, we invited some friends to meet us there.  Ordered a bottle of bubbles.  THEY DIDN'T HAVE TWO CLEAN GLASSES.  Had to wait for 10 minutes for glasses (I am not making this up).  Ordered appetizers.  Our waitress comes out and apologizes for not getting the appetizers out in a timely manner.  \"We had a 16 order take-out\" she tells us.  More delays.  Finally, the appetizers arrive.  Stuff peppers were tasty.  Waitress told us that \"sometimes you'll get a hot one, sometimes not.\"  She was correct - one was hot, two were not.  Now at this point, we are somewhat disappointed.  But then our meals arrived - well, three of the four.  The fourth one wasn't even ordered by us!    Wife's ravioli was all clumped together and pasty.  My penne pasta was still somewhat hard and very undercooked.  Nasty food.  Waitress kept apologizing for all the shortcomings and even brought us four glasses of the nastiest wine I've ever tried. NONE of us got past the first sip.  What a waste of time and money.  The only reason this gets two stars is because of our waitress.  I think she was actually embarrassed over our experience.  Will go back to M Italian in Chagrin, but won't EVER go back to Rose.  Blows my mind to know that these are sister restaurants and Rose sucks this badly.  Probably will last as long as \"Paco's Tacos\" did in that spot.  My advice is to avoid the disappointment..."}
{"text":"Date night at Rose! We had 6:15 reservations tonight and were seated promptly. We had a booth by the patio on a breezy warm evening. Our waitress was Shantia and she was training this evening. Both waitresses greeted us warmly with recommendations. Both came by several times to check on us and refill our waters (who drinks water out of fancy glasses anyway). 

We ordered the Pepperoni pizza, which has pepperonis and toasted banana peppers throughout. It is a delicious thin, fire-roasted pizza! I love thin crust and am a NY-style pizza lover to heart. The pizza is $19 for a large. We also shared a Caesar salad to start. The lettuce was shredded and complimented the rolls perfectly. It was nice and light. 

I had a Rose Mule with my dinner. It is a concoction of Limoncello, muddled blueberries, and Ginger Beer. It was refreshing with our pizza.

The manager came by to chat with us. It was nice to hear what he recommends. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, good food, good prices, highly recommend it, service is good, the patio makes a good addition"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying they just opened recently, so they deserve some slack.  But, at the same time, this is part of a chain that has a lot of Burntwood Taverns under its belt, as well as M Italian, so while I know this is a new addition to their group, at the same time, it's not like they've never opened a new restaurant before.

That said, I really wasn't super impressed. The seats are HORRIBLE.  Seriously, seriously horrible.  I cannot imagine going back to them if I have to sit in those seats again.  I admit, my rear end will never be judged as 'petite', but why should a restaurant chair -- especially in an Italian place -- remind me that I really need to 'start that diet'?  Make me feel guilty about what I want to order?  Or cause me pain?  Because literally, I felt the arms cutting into my thighs any time I shifted slightly.

Second, there are waaay too many high chairs in that place.  The bar, many tables.  I don't mind them overly, generally, but I know my husband hates them, so didn't like the idea of having to sit on them.  And they are wicker or something, so light, and they don't move well on the floor.  I felt like I had to be careful trying to get it near the table and especially pushing away from the table at the end of the meal, as I also had to contend with the feeling my legs' circulation was cut off.  BTW, my husband ended up sitting on a cushioned banquette, which he said was also super uncomfortable.

I know, you're like, 'SHUT UP ABOUT THE CHAIRS ALREADY' right?  But a restaurant's as much about the ambiance as the food.  Maybe more about it, because if I'm not comfy, I don't feel compelled to go back, unless the food is out of this world.  And its not.

This isn't to say it's bad, but it's in no way transformational, heavenly, or the like.  I ordered a supreme pizza, no onions, and ended up with a garden pizza.  It was really good and I actually didn't even notice until I got the bill and thought, \"garden pizza? oh yea, there wasn't any meat...\". So that was random (I'd thought about the garden pizza, but replayed my order in my mind and I double checked with the waiter, 'supreme, no onions, right', because I so hate onions).  

My husband ordered the chicken parm and said it, and the side of fettucine alfredo, was very good.  I also had some raspberry vodka drink with muddled raspberries, which was tasty and I have to say, they don't pour a light drink (or weren't at that point).  And for some reason we were each brought a complimentary glass of sparkling rose, which was nice.

It took FOREVER to get just about everything, including our bill.  My husband ordered tiramisu to go, and I think they had to go out and kill the ladyfingers and make it fresh.  Some of this may have been our waiter, who was a nice guy but he later told us it was his first day, so I give him the benefit of the doubt.

One final ambiance thing - the water is, for some reason, served in red plastic glasses, a la Denny's or Pizza Hut.  Really???  

And back the the chairs (yes, AGAIN WITH THE CHAIRS), when I waiter first approached us, I said, \"These chairs are hideous.  You need to tell the management how bad these are.  I have no idea why they would put these in a restaurant, unless their entire desire is to move you out of your table quickly and have you not want to return.\"  He said he'd mention it, but I have no idea whether he did.  But I saw managers walking around, approaching people at tables, talking to them, but they never came to our table.  Which is a bit annoying, especially when you've complained about something.  

Anyway, based on the fact that it's so new, we may try it again.  Though, newness does not take away the pain/annoyance/anticipation of sitting in THOSE CHAIRS again, so who knows.  Too bad.  Solon needs restaurants and at this point I've been to Burntwood so many times I could practically recite the menu.  I want to love the place, but I just can't.  THOSE CHAIRS.  Again, why do I need to feel like I should be on a diet when I'm going out to dinner.  Maybe they could sell all the chairs to Jenny Craig, and get something better.  I mean, at Jenny Craig those would be great chairs - real motivators!!"}
{"text":"If you can't give this place 5 stars you didn't have the right server! Keyanna was the best! We had a table for 9 and we weren't her only guests. She never missed a beat! Fresh coffee, multiple wines and drinks, appetizers and entrees were filled and delivered seamlessly. The restaurant its self is decorated beautifully. The food is good and reasonably priced. Enjoyed our afternoon."}
{"text":"We love M and were hoping we'd enjoy Rose's too. Wrong. We were seated in a booth that was super uncomfortable- narrow seat and straight back. Our server was nice but completely clueless the entire time. So much so, my friend and I commented several times on it. The rolls had some odd garlic butter on it which before trying it looked like italian dressing dumped over the bread. I got the Italian wedding soup- it had 1 meatball. 1. The chicken on the crispy chicken salad was slimy and seemed pre-cooked. The lettuce was shredded. The bruschetta was soggy. And not just in the middle. The bread was never toasted or grilled. Tasted like it came right out of the bag. Unfortunately, I don't see this restaurant succeeding unless there is a complete over haul in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I came here with my family as we live in the neighborhood. The location has seen many restaurants come and go. There is no reason for Rose's to last. I made a reservation on Open Table, but the restaurant didn't pick It up correctly. So we were seated, but after a wait. The menu had Italian staples but nothing too interesting. We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was over cooked with far too much breading. You couldn't taste the calamari. All of our main courses lacked taste and care in preparation. The food wasn't bad, just nothing better than you'd make at home. The best part of the evening was our server. She was professional, engaging and attentive. The rest of the night was forgettable."}
{"text":"Walked in with a group of ten at the height of lunch on a Monday. We were seated right away, and received menus.  Our waiter was very personable and did his best in handling our group.  We did have an hour wait for the main courses, but we talked so that was okay.  The food was very good.  The venue is very loud so hearing can be difficult, but after the lunch hour the crowd left, and all was good. We appreciated the separate checks."}
{"text":"Sister Restaurant to M Italian and Burntwood Tavern.  Obsessed with the interior design and decor! It has come a long way from the huge let down of Pacos Tacos! Mostly Traditional Italian food. Great staff and service ... Manager Mike was great and our server Tonya was wonderful! Food did not disappoint.. Solon needed this breath of fresh air! With summer upon us the patio boasts SUNDAY FUNDAYS! Can't wait !!! Cheers! Salute!"}
