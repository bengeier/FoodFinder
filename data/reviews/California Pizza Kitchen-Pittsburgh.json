{"text":"I'm not, by any means, an expert on pizza or Italian food, but I've always been pretty happy with the pizza at California Kitchen, regardless of location. But this review is for today, and today's experience has been the best so far.

Todd is a friendly and gracious waiter. He stopped by our table enough, not to absent and not smothering. Very happy with him.

The food portions are pretty large, the half-sized pear salad and the white pizza filled myself and my make companion, no room for dessert. Everything was tasty. We ordered a plain white pizza (not on the menu) to take home for a picky teen, and it came in time, but with a burn sport so they gave us an additonal pizza to take on the house! What service!  We plan to come back."}
{"text":"Good food and service, but our family and another large party were still eating and the staff decided they wanted to go home so they started cleaning the floors with their bleach cleaning fluid while we were dining?! The smell totally ruined our food and the wet floor required a shuffle to reach the restrooms!?  Who trained this staff???"}
{"text":"We were dragged here by friends. The sweet crust (regular not honey wheat) and sweet sauce were nauseating. The appetizers were okay but so tiny that they were barely a couple bites each. It was expensive, the food was cold. It was one of the worst meals I've had in years. I honestly cannot believe that this chain has been successful, A Trib review claimed that this was a  taste of California. Putting California in your name doesn't make that come true. Perhaps we're not as cosmopolitan in Pittsburgh as our counterparts in the sunny West. But we're not complete rubes either. A taste of California would mean fresh, well prepared meals with fresh veggies and bright flavors. Garbage pizza with bottle barbeque sauce poured all over it and topped with cheese that makes government cheese look good isn't it."}
{"text":"Pizzas are good when fresh. Appetizers are good too. Servers are really slow. Wait time is more than many places . It started off nicely but steadily going down. Disappointing to see such a successful chain doing poorly like this."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. We got the Thai Chicken spring roll appetizer, Hubby got some tortilla soup and we split a thin crust Margherita pizza. So good.  I thought the spring rolls were soooooooo good. That was a weird thing to have as an appetizer before getting a pizza.  But they do it right. The pizza was just a pizza - a good pizza by all means.  But the spring rolls were just so good, and the sauce that came with them was just heavenly. I really like Thai cuisine. Again, what a strange thing to say when reviewing a pizza place!"}
{"text":"The pizza is mediocre and you can tell they bought it from the frozen food section--it's an off brand...so I tried the double soup bowl instead....LET ME TELL YOU it reminded me of studying for the sats...you try so hard to do well, but in the end it doesn't matter because no matter what you do to the soup, you aren't going to get into college of your dreams. Don't go here unless you want to feel like you have to pay $37,000 to be stressed and irritable. Go to Pizza Roma (but don't get to thinking that I like pizza Roma either)"}
{"text":"When you think of pizza from California, CPK nailed it. The pizzas are very tasty, fresh and different that most pizza places here in PGH.  I would recommend the California Club."}
{"text":"I've had CPK twice now, first time was takeout and the second was dine in. I am obsessed with fish tacos and so of course when I saw that on their menu that's what I ordered for the takeout. I loved that you can do it all online and it's pretty easy. The tacos were good, kind of similar to the ones you can get from Houlihans, but not as good.

For my dine in experience, my friend and I ordered an appetizer... she is kinda picky so we just got the Spinach Artichoke dip... I thought it was very plain, not very many chunks of actual artichoke (which made me sad). I ordered the White Pizza (my other choice would have been the one with artichokes... but since we ordered the dip I opted not to). Every other place I have ever had white pizza at has had tomatoes on it. So I was super disappointed when it arrived and there was none. I even asked because I really just assumed it was meant to be on there! Nope... they don't do that. Awkward. It lacked taste for that reason. I wouldn't order it again. (And I know its partly my fault, I should have read menu more thorough... but seriously... NO TOMATOES?)

I'll go back, hopefully I'm happier next time."}
{"text":"Love this place! I usually do not go to Ross Park without stopping here. The best fish tacos I've had outside of San Diego, which is kind of funny considering it's a pizza chain. The staff is great, with Chuck and Carlos being my favorite. It's hard to order dessert there with the Cheesecake Factory being next door, but if your not a fan, the tiramisu is pretty good."}
{"text":"Been here several times now. Obviously the pizza is our favorite. Always spic and span clean and the staff is amazing. Try the garlic roasted chicken. It's new."}
{"text":"I love the Cali club pizza and the Cobb salad.  The ppl that work here are great!"}
{"text":"What the heck happened to cpk's food and quality? I've had fond memories of delicious dinner dates at cpk, loving almost all of their entr√©es from pasta, pizza to salads. I had lunch there today after over a year. The husband got what he always loved here, the pear & gorgonzola pizza and I got the veggie grilled sandwich with tortilla soup and Mediterranean veggie rolls for appetizers. I have to say, the food was nearly inedible. The soup was a thick mushy blend of something that didn't sit right with me every time I took a bite, as if they put whatever leftovers they had and blended it. The sandwich was soggy. The med veggie rolls were just baked tortillas rolled up with cheese inside and served with marinara sauce from a jar, and the pear & gorgonzola pizza also didn't taste fresh. Needless to say, we will no longer be returning to cpk...ever!"}
{"text":"I went there because the big cheesecake restaurant next door had a 1.5 hr wait.  Great meal.

Huge salads ... the artichoke appetizer is amazing.  The pizzas are not just pepperoni and mushrooms.  Truly unique choices.

The only downside of this location ... Christmas shoppers BUT they do have parking specifically for takeout."}
{"text":"I was at Ross Park Mall and wanted to get a bite to eat. I had never been here before so I stopped in. It was very busy, but since I was alone, I didn't have to wait. There is a bar at the back of the restaurant that could've been an option as well. My waitress was excellent; extremely kind and personable. I ordered the Red Berry Sangria which was beautiful in color and taste. Between the Sangria and my pizza, my waitress brought out a small plate of bread and dipping oil. That dipping oil though...I wanted more and the recipe! I also wished I had more bread! I ended up using the dipping oil on the crust of my Five Cheese Tomato Pizza. The pizza was excellent as well. The blend of cheeses was something to remember. I'll definitely be back to try other drinks and pizzas on the menu. While I love tasty and unique independent restaurants, I'm never above a good chain restaurant."}
{"text":"California Pizza Kitchen has finally arrived in Pittsburgh! 

This location is in Ross Park Mall near The Cheesecake Factory, L.L. Bean and Crate & Barrel. It is a fairly small location so expect at least a 30 to 45 minute wait on weekends. There is also about 50 more seats outside for when the weather is nicer. You can always call ahead and get your food to go. 

The service was pretty good given that the place was packed. I had the Korean BBQ Steak Tacos as a appetizer and my wife had the Wedge Salad. My tacos were delicious with just enough heat and kick. My only complaint was that the portion was small. (you get two) I could have easily downed two more. Our daughter had the Kids Cheeseburger Pizza and loved it! 

My wife and I had the Meat Cravers Pizza which consisted of sausage, pepperoni, bacon, Capicola ham, salami, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. We got it on a honey wheat whole grain crust.  IT WAS EPIC! The pizzas are six cut which is plenty for two people.


I had the Mango Iced Tea and my wife had the Mango Lemonade. They were both very tasty. The lemonade is extremely sweet so I would let it water down a bit before drinking it. 

I'm really happy California Pizza Kitchen is here and will be going back often. I still have to try the Butter Cake and White Chocolate Strawberry Cheesecake.

Hopefully we'll get more locations in the Pittsburgh area. Cough!, Monroeville!, Cough! Waterfront! Cough!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, but way too overpriced. And with all honesty, the restaurant also kind of smelled like an old dish rag.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, but probably because we came in between lunch and dinner so I imagine we just missed the rush. We were seated by the entrance right by the host/hostess table and we could hear all the loud conversations of the recently out of school college kids who work there. Not ideal but you can't really blame them since it was a slow afternoon.

My husband and I each got our own pizzas. I got the Hawaiian and he got The Works, each around $15. The size of the pizzas were pretty large, but not large enough to share between two people. If you were to share a pie, I would highly recommend also getting appetizers. But getting a pie to yourself will probably be enough with maybe a few slices to take home. My favorite part of the pizza was the crust, which was thin, but not too thin, and crispy yet slightly chewy. Otherwise, the flavor was kind of average. For $15 a pie, I was expecting a bit more than average. 

I enjoyed the pizza but probably not enough to justify spending that much. However, it's a nice option when you've spent a long day shopping and need a sit down meal."}
{"text":"We were glad to see that CPK finally opened up a location in Pittsburgh. We used to only have the pleasure of eating at one on trips out to King of Prussia, but no more! 

This is a good location and a welcome addition to the rather dried-up selection of places to eat in the north hills. The environment is welcoming and friendly. Typically we will each order a pizza of our own - don't expect a single to feed two. I can't think of a pizza that we've ordered that I didn't enjoy. 

If you haven't been here, definitely give it a try. You may find that parking on this side of the mall is difficult to say the least. If you don't mind a short walk, there is plenty of parking on the Sears side."}
{"text":"Went in with some family members.. We sat quickly and had a great server. The food came quick but just didn't like any of it.. We got a flat bread, salads and personal pizzas and for the price just wasn't worth it. Nothing was great and for $60 for 3 people was insane.. Great service, poor food. YA win some YA lose some"}
{"text":"The food at this CPK is always delicious from their pizzas to pastas & salads. Today my mom & I shared the Tostada pizza, which was very good. I wouldn't recommend paying extra for the chicken because you barely get any & it's a little dry. My cousin had a delicious summer strawberry & watermelon salad that was fresh & refreshing. I also love the pesto cream pasta.

Unfortunately, the service is a bit inconsistent at times. However, today we had a phenomenal server named Emily.  My mom & I waited about 15 minutes for my cousin to join us. Emily made sure we had enough to drink & even gave us bread to tied us over. My mom is very chatty & Emily was always willing to listen & has a great personality. You never had to beg for more drinks & she checked on us multiple times. She is definitely the best server we had here & most other places."}
{"text":"Last week was my first visit to to the California Pizza Kitchen and I have to say, I really enjoyed it. It was a great place to grab dinner.  The pizza was a perfect size for two,with mild appetites, to share.  The outside seating was nice, and although service was a bit slow, the waiter was very friendly.  I will say that I was never offered a refill on my drink, which was a bit disappointing.  The traditional pizza was great.  I really like the flaky crust.  I feel like it has been bake with olive oil or something - it is much better than other pizza crusts that you would find at a \"take out\" place. For dessert, I went against the recommended butter cake/ice cream and went with the red velvet cake.  It was fantastic."}
{"text":"We waited for FIFTEEN minutes before deciding to leave. Nobody even approached our table, not even one of the two servers or waitresses that came outside. No one bussed the two disgusting tables that we had to sit next to. Never going back"}
{"text":"I have often eaten here many times after long days of shopping and I have never been disappointed. Recently ate here on a Friday night after some light shopping.

The atmosphere is just great. It can be romantic, or good for catching up with friends and family. Good for every occasion!

Although I didn't get a glass this time, I would like to say that their white sangria is AMAZING. It might be the best I've ever tasted! I crave it regularly!

We were seated by a manager, who told us to grab him if we needed anything. He was friendly and professional. Normally, the servers here are super attentive and very professional, too. They are trained to pour in front of you, which is a nice touch. Our waiter this time was very Spanish, spoke a hundred miles a minute, and was very hard to understand. He was very nice though, but not completely attentive. He looked a little overwhelmed even though there weren't many tables in his section. I have had better service at this location before.

I got a 5 cheese pizza and Tom got a California Club sandwich, which he loved. My pizza was good, as usual. Ate the whole thing! I also signed up for their rewards by getting the app on my phone. I got a free small plate (like a smaller appetizer) just for signing up! 

I have heard that they are known for their butter cake dessert, but I prefer to go next door to the Cheesecake Factory and get a piece of cheesecake to go instead! :)

Overall: Go check it out! And try the butter cake and let me know if it's better than cheesecake! :)"}
{"text":"I had always had this impression that they only served pizza, and nothing else. I was totally wrong! I recently moved by the Ross Park Mall so I decided to finally give them a shot. First time I had the meat cravers thin crust pizza. This was delicious! For some reason I just love salami on pizza. It goes so good with pepperoni, and this pizza has that! It was a very unique taste and look of the pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I give that pizza 5 stars!! I would go back for more of the thin crust options, as I love a crispy thin pizza and not many places have that!

Second time I was here was a little less appetizing. I ordered the original BBQ chicken chopped salad. The actual salad part with all the yummy veggies, cheese, and dressing was delicious and I would certainly get it again, but the \"chicken\" was completely gross. I don't really know what they did to it or where it came from but I honestly don't think it was fresh chicken breast, it was almost comparable to a subway quality chicken. Don't get me wrong, that type of chicken is fine, but for a $12-$14 salad, I would expect warm, freshly grilled chicken. This chicken was cold and just not appetizing. So word of advise, ask for fresh grilled chicken if that's what you really want on your salad!

Service and atmosphere is good and it is a nice bright restaurant. Always very clean! 

I am sure I will give them another try in the future, as that pizza was good, and I will remember to ask for the good chicken!"}
{"text":"Food was OK. Not great - certainly at the price. 
There was a strange but highly noticeable odor. First, I dismissed it as part of the wood fired oven. But it was not. 
My wife ordered a drink. It had a bad aftertaste. Our server named the ingredients. He said they use Fresca. We said that my wife can't have diet soda because of the artificial sweeteners. He said Fresca is not diet it's all natural. We googled ingredients and showed him \"aspartame\". He just grinned. 
First and last trip to CPK Ross Park."}
{"text":"I have been here once, and once was enough. 

Our server was friendly and attentive - no issues there as some others have had. 

The food is....just not good. Sorry, CPK lovers, I dont get the obsession with this place. It is mediocre at best. I got a California club pizza, one of their \"signature\" items. It was a white pizza with some chicken and avocado on top. Underwhelming is an understatement. When it came to the table I instantly thought \"I just paid for this?\". Fiance got the ravioli - one giant bowl with about 6 pieces of pasta in it that he ate in about 15 minutes. We walked out the door with an almost $50.00 bill when the tip was all said and done. Totally overpriced for sub-par chain food. I would rather eat at the food court. 

I will most likely never be back here unless I am forced in a group of people who want to eat here and I dont want to be rude and make a fuss. Otherwise, I think I'll steer clear."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, staff was friendly and helpful. Waitress Danielle was good. All in all wonderful lunch."}
{"text":"I went here for the second time the first time I thought the food was mediocre.
I ordered an appetizer with corn salsa. It was professionally made and looked nice but was flavorless and tasted cheap.
I ordered a pizza with pears and walnuts which was made beautifully but tasted bitter and more earthy like green tea.
The items are made well and look good but don't taste that great."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but man, did I have some good food here.

For me, the only problem I ran into here was that when we entered the hostess was MIA.  Making us stand in a line for only about five minutes.  After that little hold up, it was smooth sailing.

My friend and I opted to sit at the bar instead of taking up a table...good choice on our part.  Upon sitting down we were greeted by the bartender promptly, I believe his name was Brian (if I'm wrong, I apologize to you sir).  We were asked what we wanted to drink and given some menus.  While looking over the menus my friend and I decided to partake in an adult beverage.  I stayed with what I knew and had a beer, my friend had their berry sangria.  His words for the taste, \"It's like drinking Kool-Aid.\"  After that we ordered an appetizer.  Opting for the sesame ginger chicken dumplings.  The mixture of flavors were very good.  The addition of scallions to a bite made the flavors pop even more.

We were still debating on what pizza to get when our appetizer had arrived.  Upon asking the bartender what his thoughts were about ordering just one pizza and he said that with an appetizer, it should be enough; he was right.  We got the Sicilian, and my god was it good.  It was a mixture of meats, mozzarella, and a spicy marinara sauce.  I believe we had it made sitting at the bar too.  Once the pizza arrived the bartender said since we were sitting there, the pizza chef put a little extra toppings on there for us.  I mean, when you sit at the bar, you get to see all the food being made.  So thumbs up to you pizza chef (he had also said that making the Sicilian was one of his favorites to make).  

Overall, the experience I had here will definitely warrant a return visit.

Points to note: outdoor seating during warmer months, they take reservations (so call ahead if you know it will be busy), Entrances from both outside and inside the mall."}
{"text":"I was visiting my family in Pittsburgh for the Holidays.  This is CPK's first launch in Pittsburgh, and it's at the nicest retail location around (go figure).  My family and I, for whatever reason, decided to hit up Ross Park two days after Christmas.  It was freakin' insane.  Somehow, the dining gods were looking down on us.  We were able to walk in and grab the last table in the joint.  

Living in Chicago I don't typically eat at chains but when your in 'da Burgh, you don't have a lot of options.  The food was average.  I ordered the bar-b-que chicken salad and my sister ordered a sandwich.  The best part of the meal was the appetizer - ORDER THE FRIED ARTICHOKES!  These bite size bits of goodness will warm your belly and your heart.  

The service was actually pretty good.  The server was quite attentive but not overbearing. (Can't stand a 'table shadow monster').  

Ironically, we didn't eat any pizza.  I don't think I could handle the BBQ chicken or pineapple pizza.  C'mon...I'm from Chicago."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but I love love love CPK! I first had their pizza in Hollywood and that started my obsession!

This is the only location I know of in Pittsburgh, so we have visited a decent amount of times. I'm semi-ashamed to say (no I'm not) that I've only ever ordered the BLT pizza! I cannot stray from it! Sadly, they took it off of the menu, but they are still able to make it, thank goodness! I could truly eat it every week it's so good. Everything tastes fresh, not like it was frozen and full of preservatives. Whether it is or isn't, it at least doesn't taste like it! 

As far as the restaurant itself, it has always been clean and the staff has been friendly. The most recent time we were there we had one of the most friendly servers I've ever experienced. He was extremely nice, helpful, and attentive. Thank you for making our dinner enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Expectations are not high for these corporate chain places, and CPK meets them. Food is pretty good but the menu is very limited. Service prompt, but not professional. For example, our bottle of wine arrives at the table uncorked, glasses and wine left on the center of the table, server leaves us the task of pouring. No big negatives, but hard to make the case for returning."}
{"text":"Family of pizza lovers. We have met our daughter several times at this location, when she was working at the mall, during her lunch break. She no longer works at the mall so we don't have a change to visit as much as we used too.  This location has always been busy. I suggest getting there early and expect to wait in a short line, because they do not take reservations. For being here several times, I find nothing impressive nor disappointing, average experience at best. We order mostly pizza and salad. We do love the crispy Mac-Cheese appetizer. It was the first time we tried it and loved it, sadly every restaurant now offers it and makes it not a novelty any longer.  We have had the Pepperoni hand tossed pizza. We have ordered the \"Works\" as well; Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Mozzarella Cheese, Onion, Green Peppers, NO Olives. We have ordered the Mushroom, Peppers, Sausage. We have always had our pizza with a Field Green half Salad to split.  I love Key Lime Pie, I make it a mission to seek out the very best. I don't care for California Pizza Oven's pie. I can't speck of the Pasta, I have never tried it, other have said it was good but nothing special about it. I do agree with others post, it is a bit overpriced for what you receive. The food is good without a doubt, but not worth the price. We have used gift cards, which has helped to offset some of the price. The service is good and friendly and I have never had a bad experience. It does take forever to get a refill or a box or your check, we learned the first time to ask for the check as soon as they drop off the food, and remind them of a box when they bring back the bill. They do offer a mobile app which looks interesting, but I have no need for it, we don't visit often. It's pricey but worth the visit with a gift card."}
{"text":"A CPK is inferior to an EPK, which is an Electronic Press Kit for musicians. This \"Cali Pizza\" is a lot like a really bad EPK actually. You know EPKs can be cool but this one never will be.

CPK is wickedly overpriced, for a start. It's popular in towns with sh** pizza like Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and Seattle. That should tell you a lot. It's some of the less good pizza I've had. It's actually more like NY Style, but a bad version of it. It's overpriced, overrated, and a corporate national chain taking business away from the little local places, such as in this case, Fiori's and Aiello's.

I don't get why people like it so much, but they do, so maybe you will too. All 3 of the people I ate it here in Pitt with, it was their first time trying it. It was not my first time. They all liked it. I never have. I still don't."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain but that doesn't make it any less delicious.  And it's a great place to stop for lunch while you're shopping at Ross Park.  The bad news is that this gets a bit of a wait during peak shopping times. 

I've been seated inside several times but last night I had the pleasure of sitting outside and really enjoyed it.  The weather was perfect and while the service was a little slow, they were very friendly and helpful.  I ordered the white sangria which has a hint of mango in it and is sooo delicious that I've never managed to make it any further down the drink menu.   

I've tried several pizzas over the past few months and have enjoyed all but one.  The chipotle chicken was very good although spicy and I also liked the roasted artichoke and spinach and the california club (minus the bacon).  I know.  I know.  I'm probably one of the few people in Pittsburgh who doesn't believe bacon makes everything better.  The only one I haven't liked to date was the five cheese and fresh tomato.  It was very blah and there are so many local pizzerias and Italian eateries that make a much better version.  I think the pizzas are a perfect size to split between two people (3 slices each) and still leave a little room for dessert.

Yes, dessert.  Be sure to save room for the butter cake w/vanilla ice cream.  It melts in your mouth although the calories and fat content must be through the roof.  It's big enough that I'd recommending sharing rather than getting your own."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Saturday afternoon for lunch. We were seated within a few minutes and greeted by the manager who welcomed us on our first visit to CPK. Our waiter and the rest of the staff were very attentive and friendly, it's one of the best customer service experiences I've had at any restaurant. 

We ordered two pizzas and one salad. Our food was quite good and the prices were reasonable. The menu seems quite varied and includes a lot of options other than pizza. I also noticed they had a couple craft beers on tap, which is always a good thing. I would definitely come here again the next time I'm near the mall."}
{"text":"A fancy pizza chain, as opposed to chains like Domino's or Pizza Hut, is not all that common, although CPK also has an impressive selection of drinks, salads and appetizers, and even pastas. From an overview of the other reviews, it seems that service here can be a give or take, but coming in on a Sunday afternoon revealed a pretty calm atmosphere and overall attentive service by our waiter. 

From the start we were taken in, as the manager, upon finding out it was our first time there, offered us a flat bread on the house. They had several kinds, and the spinach and mushroom that we got was delicious. As for the pizza, we only tried the California Club this time, which was almost like a salad on top of the pie, and a very hearty one at that. Will definitely return for another pizza next time."}
{"text":"The host danced us to our table, and he remained for an excessively long time, asking us overly personal questions and touting the benefits of California-style pizza (there are none). When we finally rid ourselves of the overbearing host, we waited for drinks and for our order to be taken. After a wait time paralleled in magnitude by the host's unprofessionalism, we left and drank Orange Julius. It wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Only been once but a very good experience. I enjoyed the pizza and the service was great. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I had an unfortunate 5 hour wait on an oil change (thanks Sears), so caught the Germany v. Ghana game at the bar. Had \"The Works\" hand-tossed pizza & it was phenomenal. Totally blew me away. Don't let it being a chain in the mall turn you away. Save your tastebuds from the food-court & order some good food. Sitting at the bar you get to see the prep in the kitchen, and every dish that came out looked delicious. I'll definitely go back to try out more menu items!"}
{"text":"Call ahead seating is advised if you take the wife & kids there on a Friday night.   Good ambiance, though my waiter was a bit snotty.  I had the $13 meat lover's pizza, which was a bit overdone, but very tasty.  Portion sizes are clever - about 1.5 servings.  Not quite enough to share."}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome food.  Place is chill but very nice.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I feel a little weird reviewing a chain, but I had some seriously awesome food here earlier today for lunch.  I came with a couple of friends, and we ordered a bunch of stuff to share.  Sharing is caring after all, ha!

Anywho, we got a thin-crust wild mushroom pizza, the BBQ chicken chopped salad, and a $30 lunch special for two (one app:  spinach-artichoke dip, two entrees: the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage pizza & the Original BBQ Chicken pizza, and a dessert:  Belgian Chocolate Souffle cake).  

Everything was SO good.  The Wild Mushroom and BBQ Chicken pizzas were especially delicious.  I don't know how other CPK chains are, but the one in Ross Park Mall is legit.  If you're looking for a good meal after shoppin' up a storm, hit this place up.  This CPK is WAY better than the Cheesecake Factory next door.  Trust me, you'll thank me later!  

Oh, and the service here was great!  Our waitress was super nice AND quick."}
{"text":"Though a chain pizza place, I have never had a bad experience at any of the California Pizza Kitchens that I've been to!

I believe that I've eaten at this location three times over the last several years. I've only ever had pizza here - Pear Gorgonzola, Hawaiian BBQ, and White Cheese. All three of these pizzas were delicious. I'm actually dreaming of the White Pizza right now! 

Service has been OK. The wait time has never been quick, but I've also never become irritated by the wait... maybe 30 minutes or so. 

Even though CPK isn't as exciting as a local, hole-in-the-wall type pizza place, they consistently deliver good food with descent service at a moderate price. And since I like consistency, and am dreaming of their pizza right now, I give them 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The pizza is always yummy! I'm a stickler for good pizza and I always look forward to the various options on their menu. The Pear and Gorgonzola is delicious along with the California Club. I've tried the gluten-free crust option as well and it is so good you can't taste a difference.

Unfortunately this time the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer was fairly cold when we got it... and it even came out pretty quickly. The taste was also nothing special. 

The service is usually good... sometimes it's mediocre depending on who is working. If you are going to come here, come for the pizza... that's the main thing that will dazzle you."}
{"text":"Not a great selection of dinners but honestly the food is always good and the service always 5-stars. Landed here many times while trying to get into the neighboring cheese cake factory that had too long wait (75-90 min) compared to 6 min at California pizza oven. Great service here guys! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Definitely avoid the girl behind the bar she basically just goes through the motions and pretends like she's the best server ever. Last time we were here we had Lacey and had an amazing experience. So if you would like one too request her!"}
{"text":"I like cpk because it's a nice modern feel, and the food is very comfortable and fun to eat. I would say that the food is a little bit on the heavier side though, especially the avocado spring rolls I got (which were good btw...but still really oily and heavy). But besides that, the pizza was delicious, a nice thin crust and really nice combination of toppings. I really liked the chicken bbq pizza because it had a nice blend of sweet and smoked flavor, along with good accessory toppings. Would definitely come back to this place because it's convenient and in the mall, and also because the food is just comforting."}
{"text":"After dining here multiple times since my previous review, and trying several of their non-pizza options, I feel I can say that this is one of my more preferred chain restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. Service has, at times, left something to be desired, but every food item I have had here has been tasty, especially for a chain. Consistency in food is something this particular location does well, which is always important. 

Non-pizza items I have enjoyed: asparagus & arugula salad, bianco flatbread (ok, sort of pizza-y), chicken lettuce wraps, California fields salad (Fresh watermelon, strawberries and field greens with our housemade Champagne vinaigrette, Feta, basil and California pistachios), oven-roasted turkey and brie sandwich (Roasted turkey breast, warm Brie, shaved Bosc pears and baby greens with housemade honey-mustard), and the California club sandwich. I like the option of the lunch duo (half sandwich or small pizza and choice of a cup of soup or salad) as well. Definitely a solid choice for lunch while at the mall!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible waiter tonight at CPK, I waited what seemed like forever for him to appear. I requested bottled water and after 10 minutes he told me they didn't have any. I ordered a glass of wine and an unsweetened ice tea. He didn't bring my ice tea. When he brought my pizza I mentioned my iced tea, he apologized and bought it. He didn't return to ask if I needed anything. I flagged him down and asked for a box which he retrieved and basically threw on the table. I flagged him again for my check left the $ amount and a tip and left. I will definitely contact corporate to express my dissatisfaction with him. The food was good he was horrible."}
{"text":"If you like sweet crust, sweet sauce and cold pizza then this is the place for you! The crust was dry and so sweet that it could have passed for a mediocre cookie. And the sauce was sweet to the point of cloying. The cheese had already begun to congeal and harden by the time it came out. The wait staff dissapeared and were impossible to get a hold of. Its as if they knew we'd send it back if they made eye contact.

The appetizers were pretty good but the portions were so paltry that they barely provided more than three bites. The description in the menu was that they were \"great for sharing\" Um.... no, methinks not. 

Honestly this is the worst pizza I've had in years. I don't understand the hype, perhaps just the Pittsburgh Ross Park location is bad. But I know I won't waste my time or money there again. If you want good pizza pretty much any other place will give you a better meal and for a lot less. 

My recommendation for amazing wood fired pizza (and far cheaper) is Piccolo Forno in Lawrenceville. I'm sure there are tons of great places in da burgh for Pizza. CPK is NOT one of them."}
{"text":"Waited almost a year to give them a try again after their colossal mess up that I never received the refund they promised..... And again.... The takeout  was awful! My lettuce wraps were made inedible with all of the lettuce being brown! Maybe I'll learn this time to stop giving them chances"}
{"text":"This location is great if you want a meal that isn't \"food court\" food!  I had a thin crust pepperoni pizza.  It was good, though I thought pricey for what you got.  

The atmosphere was nice...  good for a family meal.  It was nice to be able to see the basketball scores as well on the multiple tv's!"}
{"text":"Out of all of the CPK that I have visited this one is definitely my favorite. The staff is friendly and the pizzas are usually pretty spot on.

My favorite appetizers there are the Asparagus & Arugula Salad (so light yet so tasty!), White Corn Guacamole & Chips (super delicious!), Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings (seriously so good), and Lettuce Wraps. Sometimes I just order all four of those instead of a meal.

Outside of those apps/small plates, I have only had a few of their pizzas: the Margherita and Roasted Garlic Chicken are the only two I remember lol (hey, it's been awhile!). The margherita has been great majority of the times that I have ordered it. The roasted garlic chicken did not sit well with me. The garlic taste was way overpowering because they have rather large pieces of cloves scattered throughout the pizza. Imo, I love garlic, but it should be kept to a minimum as the flavor is incredibly intense.

Drinks-wise CPK does alright, nothing special. I wouldn't go just for drinks, I should say. There are a few places I would put ahead of them. Anyway, if you're in Ross Park Mall and hungry this is definitely a better pick than anything else in the mall, including the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Been a couple years since we've been to CPK. Knew they were having a free meal for Veterans Day so we took the opportunity to go. My husband was able to choose from 13 different items on a special Veterans Day menu. He went with the Hawaiian Pizza. Surprisingly (not!) he ate the whole thing. Said it was good. I never tried so I'm going to go with that! I was so looking forward to getting my favorite pizza of all time, the Pear and Gorgonzola. I almost cried when it wasn't on the menu!! Our waiter said it had been gone for a few months already. If the powers that be are reading this review I demand you bring that pizza back. PLEASE BRING BACK THE PEAR AND GORGONZOLA PIZZA!!!! I went with the spinach and roasted artichoke pizza instead. It was good, but not as good as the other one. It had a very, very thin and crispy crust and there was one piece of artichoke on each slice of the pizza. I would have preferred more, but that's what I got. That as well as the spinach was layered over a well thin spread of CPK's spinach artichoke dip which is one of their appetizers. I did like it though and wouldn't hesitate to reorder. For an app we went with the Avocado Club Egg Rolls. People, these are amazing. Every time I get them I think they couldn't be this good, but they are. I insist you try them. My husband is not really an avocado fan and even he thinks they are awesome!  The are stuffed with amazing goodness and deep fried in a crispy wonton. Dip these puppies in the ranchito sauce, a little bit spicy, and you have one of these best bites to go in your mouth. Love them so much!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The kids liked their food. Good soup and flatbread. I want to try pizza next time. We sat outside which was nice. The service was not so great. The waitress wasn't nice, seemed liked she was bothered by having to wait on us. We didn't ask for anything special, we we're not troublesome. I would go back, hopefully the service will be better. If you get the cpk app, you can save on your bill and get free items."}
{"text":"I love CPK and almost always have a great experience. Their menu has expanded and hey offer a range of craft cocktails as well. 

Food: We ordered pepperoni pizza and chicken fettuccini. Both were good although the flavor of the fettuccini dish wasn't as light as it should have been.  Although it wasn't a cream sauce it came off as needlessly heavy. We wouldn't order that again. 

Service: Initially was good until I received a refill that was a Diet Coke instead of regular. Then it took about 10 minutes to get my pizza boxed. But the worst part of the experience was paying for the check. Within minutes of initially sitting down I informed my waiter I would be using Mobile Pay, CPK's new feature where you can create a tab via the app and pay for your meal right from the table. He acknowledged it, I gave him the code to link to my tab in-app, and I thought we were set. Once we were finished, paid, then exited, he comes running out accusing (not asking) me of not paying. I told him I used the app, and he says, 'no, you didn't.' At this point I'm getting angry because 1) don't tell me what I didn't do. He may not have seen or been privy (even though he should have been), but he cannot attest to what I did. 2) I showed him the receipt in the app and all of a sudden it comes to him. It was embarrassing and never should have occurred."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best place to eat in Ross Park Mall. I've never had a single complaint about service or food/beverage quality. My favorite meal here is the Grilled Veggie sandwich. It has grilled peppers, mushrooms, cheese & mixed greens with am AMAZING sun dried tomato aioli. I always get this with a side of tortilla soup. This is the only place I've found a vegetarian tortilla soup & it's so delicious. I also enjoy their mojito which is served with a piece of sugar cane."}
{"text":"Went to CPK for lunch today and had a really positive experience. As someone with food sensitivities, I was thrilled with their attention to detail and extensive list of allergens across the menu. (Ask the server or manager for their special allergy menu or verified gluten free menu for more details if you want/need.) 

I ended up having the soup and salad combo (Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley with the Spinach + Quinoa Power Salad) and not only was it delicious, it was the perfect portion size. 

Will definitely be going back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place. Lots of great healthy (and veggie) options. I've had several of their pizzas and an awesome roasted veggie salad. Great service. Only con is a tad pricey."}
{"text":"Took my wife and daughter out for mother's day after a movie. We arrived at 7pm (they close at 8). Plenty of time for a nice relaxing dinner. This was our 2nd visit to this location. From the minute we sat down our waitress seemed like she was in a hurry to get home. The food was not as good either, cold salad which was supposed to be warm, 5 shrimp in each (15 bucks for the same salad but 5 bucks extra with shrimp...5 bucks per shrimp per salad...a buck a shrimp?) Really??? Skimpy on the shrimp. Overpriced, some ingredients missing since first visit, cold not warm as it should be, etc. Service again was rushed and abrupt. She practically slammed the plates down in front of us and not in a way to uncrowd the table as we were sharing some of the pizza, (which is pretty good, the cauliflower veggie) but again way overpriced for a small 6 cut pizza at almost $18. Nope. Decent food and service 1st visit, but no so good on the 2nd. And again...ABSOLUTELY OVERPRICED for the quality and portions. Doubtful we'll return. I'd rather take the 65 bucks and go to Sesame Inn."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way out of the Ross Park Mall.  Guess shopping makes us hungry.  We sat at the bar and our service was great.  We received bread and dipping oil to start.  I ordered from the lunch duo of a 7\" pizza and salad.  A nice meal at a fair price. Enjoyed the pizza with a good crust and had the Mediterranean salad.  Was not a fan of the salad because the dressing is a mustard herb vinaigrette that is just to mustardy, while I do enjoy mustard, the mustard overwhelmed any other taste of the salad."}
{"text":"Xmas break is never a good time to go shopping.  But it was a good time to visit CPK.  The wait for a table was about 30 minutes.  We got a cozy booth.  Our server seemed a bit beaten down by the lunch time rush.  But soon warmed up.

We started with a \"small craving\" wedge salad to share.  Yummy blue cheese dressing with bacon, chopped egg and fresh diced tomatoes.  We also got a Hawaiian Bar-be-que pizza with whole wheat crust to share.  I love their fresh pineapple, BBQ chicken, Gouda & mozzarella cheeses, yummy barbecue sauce, sliced red onions and cilantro.  The chicken on this pizza is so tender.  Love this pizza!  I wish I could make this crust at home!  

We decided to share a red velvet cake for dessert.  The cake was amazing.  The cake is very moist and the vanilla bean cream cheese frosting is not too sweet.  It was served on vanilla bean sauce with a big scoop of Haagen-Dazs.  It's a little pricey, but SO worth it!  I love CPK!"}
{"text":"Opted for California Pizza Kitchen as opposed to the food court at Ross Park Mall in the hopes of finding a respite from the shopping chaos. Then I remembered I have a 14-month old child in tow, there is no respite EVER. All kidding aside, they staff were very accommodating with us and our feisty toddler. Our waiter was also super sweet with our little girl. We made a lunch out of appetizers and ordered a plain cheese pizza off the kids menu for the baby.  I had flatbread with Brussels sprouts and bacon which was DELISH.  The crispy mac n' cheese was enjoyed by both adults and baby. AND the kids cheese pizza was very good, even if baby girl preferred her cheerios and milk, I enjoyed it. Would definitely go back next time we're at the mall and in the mood for table service. No lie, husband and I both got a beer, you can't get that kind of comfort at the food court!"}
{"text":"California Pizza kitchen is a chain restaurant which you will find in other cities. Their specialty is pizza of course with a vast multitude of different toppings you can choose from.

They do offer salads, desserts, and drinks but unless you are sharing expect to pay a bit more for your pizza. Sharing is permitted with no additional fee.

On this visit my friend and I shared a vegetable topped pizza. Before you get it you are served 4 small breads with dipping sauce. They do not give you an extra plate for your pizza. While the food was average we usually end up taking the rest of it home.

Service is good. They are located right inside the main entrance of Ross Park Mall. You can choose to eat indoor or outdoor. It is really not a place I would go out of my way for but have to be in the mood for it.

They have WiFi but a very poor one to say the least. The place is clean and nice rest rooms.  

I feel the pizza is overpriced but you are in a sit down restaurant so there's no much else you can do about it. I am usually able to get in without a long wait."}
{"text":"Shopping AND pizza?! This must be heaven. 

My friend and I stopped in for some much needed nourishment after an intense shopping session. We were greeted promptly by our server who was fantastic throughout the whole meal. Very courteous and attentive!

I started with a small plate of Asparagus + Arugula Salad which was too good to be only 180 calories. I love anything that's healthy and delicious! The vinaigrette was great - sweet but not overpowering. The Shaved Mushroom + Spinach Flatbread was tasty but average quality, in my opinion. It was very crispy and the veggies were cooked well, but it was a bit oily. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my meal; however, I would agree that their food is overpriced for the quantity and quality. Sure, it's not the best food you'll ever taste in your life but it sure hits the spot if you need a quick pizza fix."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, unique for Pittsburgh. Lighter, more flaky then you expect.
Good, but not excellent. Service was decent, nothing special. Will not be my first choice in the future."}
