{"text":"Good flavors and they will increase/decrease spice levels to your taste. The Alo Gobi and Lamb Curry were standout dishes, Best Indian in the area, much better than Nawab!"}
{"text":"This is not authentic Indian food whatsoever. 

The Butter Chicken was basically chopped up chicken in a tomato sauce and the furthest thing from authentic. We got a vegetable dish and you can tell the vegetables were frozen prior to cooking, especially the carrots.  The Naan bread is extremely sticky and dough-y and very hard to pull apart, it's almost like plastic.  For $55, we are very disappointed and even called to tell them, with no offer of a refund or any way to make up for it.  

Do not waste your hard earned money here. It's brand new and we really wanted to give it a chance, hopefully they improve their quality.

The daal was okay!"}
{"text":"BEST INDIAN FOOD IN TOWN! Wow. Cooked to perfection. Coconut rice is perfect. Good samosas. Great heat on the food

Hurray!"}
{"text":"Yuga recently opened off 85th Street in SW Calgary. The restaurant seems to be a \"satellite\" of sorts, from its primary full restaurant location downtown. The 85th St location is a take-out with a few tables available to eat in, if you wish.

For my first visit, I ordered butter chicken, beef vindaloo, lamb curry, and goat korma, as well as naan and rice. From time of order, it took about 30 minutes to get the food. Given this, I recommend calling in to order rather than ordering at the location.

All dishes were flavourful and the meat was tender. I found the vindaloo slightly spicy, but the rest of the dishes were pretty mild. Overall, I found the dishes to be very \"accessible\" Indian. The portions were generous, with the above order providing enough food for about 6 servings. The naan portions were especially generous, with a $2 order providing a dinner plate sized piece.

In addition to the regular menu of Indian take out items, the store also has a varied collection of Indian sweets.

For those who live close by, I see the restaurant as a great option for an easy dinner. I plan on visiting again i the future to try more dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Tried it once as it's near my place. And less tasty than the curry at CO-OP nearby but at a higher price. Don't bother..."}
{"text":"This is good food, and friendly service. It's a good option for take out if you live in the area. I have ordered take out twice there now"}
