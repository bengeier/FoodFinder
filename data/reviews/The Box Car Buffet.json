{"text":"Last year when I ate here on their Seafood Night! The place was hopping with eager eaters! But today, when I m here for their BBQ Night! The place was so empty n dead. Now I know the reason why not so many people Yelp about this establishment! First, it is locate way far off away from the Las Vegas downtown area. Second, the buffet serve here is very small in selection n variety! Even though their price is quite cheap comparing to the buffets on the strip! But I can eat better n paid less at the Feast buffets at all the Station's Casinos n most of the Asian buffets in the LV area. My first impression of this place last year was a diamond in the rough. But after eating here again today! I realize it was just a mirage or a great magic trick!"}
{"text":"This is a very small but good buffet. A mere $11.99 on Friday night with steak, shrimp and crab legs. It's not Bacchanals but it's good buffet. They even have big rig parking. Good luck finding that on that on the strip. Commercial Drivers (CDL) get 15% off."}
{"text":"Can I say disgusting?  The food was lousy and a severe disappointment especially being famished!  What a waste of an empty stomach and money!"}
{"text":"Back again. This time on a Friday night. It's a locals gem that hardly anyone knows about. Walk in to a buffet with no waiting on a Friday night in Vegas! Once again, its a small buffet but good food!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Horrible quality. Food poisoning inducing. It's not even getting what you paid for because there are several great buffets in the 15-20$ price range. Sides come in tubs. Desserts are frozen. Meat is so tuff you can chew it. If your goal is to eat as much as you can from a 5 foot buffet of TV dinners you'll be happy! We went for their steam and crab buffet. AWFUL. I spent the night in the restroom."}
{"text":"So until recently,  this was our family's favorite Friday night dinner plan...  King crab legs.   Well,  don't go if you have children that are over 13.... The players card allows for a substantial discount,  for the cardholder ONLY.   Children are half price...  BUT...  They charge the FULL adult fare for teenagers because \"they don't have a card\"  even though legally they cannot have one,  and they don't allow the card holder to bring a guest.   I played there nearly every week for years,  and after the way the manager and employees talked to me I will not be back. Food is  it that great in the buffet to go back and be treated like that."}
{"text":"The buffet here wasn't bad. I went with my friends to go to Grand Canyon. After Grand Canyon, we might as well stop by and eat here. The price wasn't bad at all, we paid the Sunday continental breakfast.   They had GOOD SELECTION of food from omelets, pancakes, ham steaks, many variety of pies dessert, salad, and more. The food here was good and what you pay is what you get right?  The service was alright. The server was ok, they listen and try to get your drinks correctly. This is a small buffet, so don't expect that $9.99 is a huge Thanksgiving dinner."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've had in a long time tried to leave half a star but couldn't do it when we first walked in there were no plates when they brought plates they were dirty the silverware was dirty the chicken was bloody but the wait staff was good"}
{"text":"Located in the Railroad Pass Hotel Casino in Henderson. OK, so here's the thing, I have driven passed this place several times on my way to either Laughlin or Boulder City, and not stopped in. Well this time I did, I am really glad I did. Is this the Bellagio buffet? Not a chance. But it doesn't claim to be, and for a month long special of $4.99 (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner!) you can't beat it.  The server was very nice, and everything in the buffet was fresh. If you find yourself out that way, I say don't be such a snob stop in and give it a try! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"The price was good & the soda taste normal but that is the best thing I can say about this buffet. The \"taco meat\" looked like they opened a can of wet dog food & threw it in a bowl. The carrots were mushy, the lettuce for the salad had an odd taste, the fried chicken looked great but was just a fatty mess. There was not a large selection of food either & what was there was old. The egg rolls & the fish strips were rock hard like they had been sitting there for hours. Save your money, don't eat here!!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night is BBQ pork rib. The selection is not too much, but everything is fresh. BBQ pork rib is outstanding, very moist. I order the spicy sauce, it is not spicy at all for my Texan taste. I am surprised to find the French Fries and Crispy Fried Chicken both are super good. Specially, they have \"sugar free\" desserts, if there is pink top on the desserts, they are sugar free. Plus, I like their brownie, not very sweet as other American bakery. One thing is not good in here... The service is a little bit slow, otherwise I will give them 5 stars in stead of 4."}
{"text":"Wife and I like a value.  This $9.99 buffet was better than the $25.99 buffet on the strip.  For lunch it was good and we both enjoyed left very satisfied and thought it was a good value compared to more expensive buffets."}
{"text":"This was over cooked steak, nasty wilted lettuce and poor customer service. Just not  the best choice...we figured it's in the middle of nowhere how bad or expensive could it be... well here hold my beer ... I could have smoked 100 joints before coming in and this would not have helped my munchies. Just keep driving"}
