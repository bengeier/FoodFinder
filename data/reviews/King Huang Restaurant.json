{"text":"I'm quite pleased. Came for dinner tonight. Each dish we ordered was quite tasty, and came nice and hot. 

Had:
Free starter soup - had two bowls. Not mind-blowing, but very solid. Carrot, turnip, pork bone, I think. 

Honey and black pepper deep fried oysters - yum. Slightly more peppery than I'm used to, but good. I think there were about eight of them. Decent sized oysters too.

Egg white and seafood broccoli - This is one of my favorite dishes to order when we go out for Chinese food. The egg whites were nice and smooth. The egg yolk mixed into it wonderfully. There were shrimps, artificial crab meat chunks and small scallops in the egg white, if I'm not mistaken. The broccoli wasn't overcooked and it wasn't tough. I believe this one was $15.99.

Shrimp paste tung choi - I love tung choi. Wikipedia calls it water spinach. Whatever it is, it's delicious. It's grandpa's favorite, and he loved it here. I quite enjoyed it as well.

Some special pork ribs (not on the menu yet but will be soon) - they're done with what I've been told is a Chiu Chow style spice and something like sweet soy, and the riblets are served atop broccoli. The ribs were sweet and savory and slightly unique without being overly different. 

Beef brisket and bean curd sheets in hot pot - right off the bat I could smell the beef. That's a really good sign. It means they haven't drowned the beef in tenderizer so much that it supposedly is meat, but doesn't taste like meat. That makes me really sad. This beef brisket was tender and saucy and the bean curd sheets were yummy. The ratio of beef to bean curd sheets was also really good. No filler veggies.

Shredded chicken with jellyfish - we had half a chicken. It was a very large half a chicken. It was also really tasty. It had a sauce that tasted like sesame mixed with Chinese seasoning salt (with much less salt). It was delicious. This is a cold dish, for those of you who have never had it. In Chinese, it's name includes the words \"hand shredded\". For something that had been shredded by hand, this wasn't shredded very much. It also wasn't the best de-boning I've ever seen. Be careful, there might still be bone fragments. For those of you who like to eat the meat left on the bones, they also serve you the bones of the chicken. This was super tasty. It was presented quite well too.

Taro and preserved meat fried rice - very flavorful. I quite enjoyed this as well, although I really didn't eat much of it, given how much other food we had.

Taro and purple rice sweet soup - Free at the end. I really like how the sweet soups here change daily. Yesterday's was pumpkin sago sweet soup. Today's taro and purple rice sweet soup was just sweet enough without being overly so. It was also good on the taro and purple rice flavors. It wasn't just sugar water. The consistency was good too. My cousin didn't want hers, so I asked for it to be packed. The owner took my cousin's untouched bowl into the kitchen, then poured me a container of brand new sweet soup (which was probably about twice as much sweet soup as had been in my cousin's bowl). Totally awesome of her! 

Side note on yesterday's pumpkin sago: Good consistency. Awesome pumpkin flavor. Lovely color. It was so good in the restaurant that we ordered containers of it to go (brought it to my grandmother's house that night where it was consumed incredibly quickly. I didn't even get any).

I'd order everything we ordered tonight again, and I don't doubt that I will. I'm very very happy. Can you tell by the length of my review? =D"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Good consistent dishes and the seafood always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Food: good taste, greasy (it's casual Chinese food, remember?), okay-mediocre portions (depending on the dish).
Service: friendly.
Atmosphere: very casual.
Parking: difficult as the plaza is always busy, but there is a large parking lot + underground parking garage.

This was originally 3 stars, but I added one more because the double boiled soup was really amazing. If you place reservation that is at least 1 day prior, you can order a complimentary double boiled soup (per person, so count your party). Also, there are a bunch of dishes that are not listed on the menu, but can be pre-ordered/custom-ordered for your party. Although King Huang Restaurant looks unassuming, it's not bad."}

(I initially had this review under OX Land Restaurant as it wouldn't allow me to add King Huang, but now that this place is included I'll move my original review here.)

I visited here on a Sunday at 4:30pm for an extremely early dinner. I've been to Maple Yip a couple of times, but wanted to give this place a shot. I was greeted quite happily and the employee made sure I had everything taken care of.

The portions here are quite large, which seems to be consistent with what was OX Land. I ordered the Yeung Chow fried rice, half of a free range chicken, steamed chicken with lotus leaves, and ordered beef and preserved vegetables fried noodle for takeout.

I didn't have much comment for most of the dishes; the prices are ridiculously cheap (lower than Maple Yip), so I can't really complain about the quality. It's a good place for extreme budget affairs, but if you have a bit more money you can always look beyond here."}
{"text":"Food and price is awesome; free soup and dessert is bonus and they have 10% discount for regulars."}
{"text":"Best chicken ever!!! It had flavor, and great seasoning and was moist and juicy. We would definitely come back here for a great dinner."}
{"text":"3.5 Star

I did not have too much expectation for King Huang Restaurant, especially during lunch special. Most of the items on the menu from $5.99. But I got to pick what kind of tea I drink, I have this huge bowl of complimentary soup of the day!

Beef Noodle ($6.99) was decent in portion. Nothing too amazing but quite good. 

I would not hesitate coming back again to King Huang for lunch or even dinner if I want to have some cheap eat.

Service also fast and efficient. 

And if you want to have a taste of wok hay, the essence of Cantonese cooking, you might want to give King Huang a try."}
