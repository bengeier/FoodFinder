{"text":"Excellent Buns (Vermicelli)  Pretty Good Rice  Lots of people I work with usually get the yellow noodles, I believe thats  what they famous for  Huge portions  Fast, friendly service  Pretty damn cheap, good for every day lunch!"}
{"text":"this is the place i've been wanting to back in years! i remember coming here when i was a wee kid but never got the chance to go back. i have somewhat a vague memory of this place serving the BEST dry yellow/rice noodles with oyster sauce (i think in vietnamese it's called Mi/Hu Tieu Kho) excuse my bad spelling.  So just the other day, i decided to head back and try it again and what i found out was that this is the ONLY place that serves up dry yellow AND rice noodles in the same bowl! Other vietnamese restaurants only give you the option of choosing one or the other.  I ordered my noodles and when they arrived, i was very excited! Digging into the bowl was like digging into my childhood memory and it tasted great! Surprisingly, it was soo good that i was the first to finish eating. The soup on the other hand i wasn't able to finsh cause it was too saltly for my taste (as you can tell i'm not a big fan of salty foods 1. it can cause high blood pressure, 2. high sodium intake is not good for your health, 3. too much salt often covers up the taste of food) But going back to the point, i thought the food was delish! and i would have ordered another bowl but i was already full so i didnt. Probably nex time i'll order only the yellow noodles cause the rice noodles were a bit soft and soggy but the sauce was just right which i really enjoyed. atmosphere i would say is a bit dingy and may require some renovations but aside from that i thought it was great."}
{"text":"This is my family's number one favourite place to eat in Downtown Toronto.   We have been eating here for many years and the food and service is always good.  I have had many plates of com suon (rice w/ pork chop) and I have come to the conclusion that there is no better place than here. I am convinced that this place makes com suon the absolute best. The pork chop is absolutely delicious and the fish sauce is made so well. I always have to have an extra meal to take home!   The shrimp cracker is very good as well.   Overall, decent prices, great food and atmosphere.   Yes, it is a little worn down but don't let that stand in the way of how amazing this place is!"}
{"text":"Don't need to look at the menu anymore for the owner already knows what I want  Food never disappoints as well as the garlic provided for the noodles"}
{"text":"My family has eaten here often and never had a bad meal everything is yummy and well priced and the service has always been very good. I love this place"}
{"text":"I came to this spot specifically due to a recommendation from a friend (who is also a foodie). My first take on this is that the food is decent. For a restaurant in Chinatown, it was very clean and recently updated. Also, the food was prompt and the service was formal (yet good).  I ordered a) Shrimp Mango Salad - it was a huge portion and worth the value. All the ingredients were fresh. However, the dressing did not wow me.  b) Vermicelli with Roll / Beef / Shrimp Cane - HELLO authentic Vietnamese spring roll. It was tasty and do I taste bamboo shoots in there somewhere? Yum. The beef and shrimp cane tasted ok (translation: nothing unique). The sauce was good - not too tangy nor sweet.   I don't really have anything truly exciting to say about this place. I might return to try some of their other dishes but I am not in a real desperate rush to do so. However, based on other yelpers review, I should try the yellow/white noodle Fukien mix. Interesting. Maybe I WILL return."}
{"text":"i've been searching everywhere for good, homemade noodle soup.  It's very hard to find a place that makes good \"Hu Tieu My Tho\" the dry version. I've finally found it!  Prices are decent, portion is just right and it's what you would eat at your mom's or grandma's house"}
{"text":"Known for its Fukien yellow noodle with shrimp cracker.  It's been in the neighbourhood for a long time.  Not a place for pho, but a spot for Hu Tieu.  Outside is a bit run down but never judge a book by its cover especially when it comes to Asian food.  Been here a few time for lunch.  The food is nothing fancy or pretentious, rather, it's homy, comfort food one can enjoy for a quick lunch.  Their specialty noodle comes with mixed yellow noodle and vermicelli, the shrimp cracker can get soaky fast so it's probably better to have it on the side.  The broth has flavour but never comes out boiling hot, which is a draw back.  Spring roll comes out in large portion and it tastes a bit different than other Vietnamese places.  Also tried their bun bo Hue but wouldn't recommend it, as the portion is small and doesn't include complementary bean sprout/basil/cabbage other place provides.   The lady host is very friendly and pleasant which makes the whole experience better, especially considering typical monotonous service received from other Chinatown places."}
{"text":"Dont let the decor fool you.  The place is a little old and worn, looking.  But the food that arrives at your table, whether it is the spring rolls or the noodle soup, is simply some of the best tasting food ive ever eaten.  The waitstaff even warns you about the spiciness of some of the sauces.  Cautioning that it is really spicy!  Which obviously is very useful information if you are sensitive to spice.  Enjoy your meal, we sure do every time we come here."}
{"text":"Hard to believe  this is my first time here as this place has been around for so many years.  I probably  avoided  eating here because  it looked run down and after  years of bad image and lack of diners, it just wasn't  on my go-to place to try.  I met friends here for dinner, so came with an open mind. Upon entering the restaurant  it didn't  look bad as it looked  like it received a makeover  and looks a bit modern from what I remembered in the past.  Tried their famous Fuk Kien Noodles with fried shrimp cracker and it was quite tasty.  The soup was very flavourful, bowl contained a good amount of pork and definitely  lots of noodles.  I  question the freshness of the noodles because it tasted a bit off, but it may be because  it was noodles I'm not used to.  The shrimp  cracker was a bit too oily for my liking and got soggy very  quick in the soup which made it an unpleasant tasting.  We ordered  shrimp/pork rice rolls and fried spring rolls to share.  Rice rolls contained too much vermicilli and not enough shrimp (one shrimp cut in half for each roll).  The fried spring roll didn't  taste  fresh and was too oily for my liking - perhaps I'm  just not used to such fried foods.  Since it wasn't  busy at all (we were the only table), we had exceptional  service and the server even gave her recommendations as we had a hard time deciding  on some dishes.  Prices are very reasonable  and portions are  good size.  Overall, it was a pretty good experience and I'll  probably  come back to try other food items as the menu is quite extensive  with good selection of different types of noodle dishes that isn't  your typical pho."}
{"text":"This place is popular for 2 dishes:  1) Fu-kien noodles - half vermicelli half egg noodles in a tasty broth with pork slices and accompanied by a big shrimp cracker.  Be sure to ask for the shrimp cracker separately otherwise it gets soggy in the broth. This is their most famous dish and you'll see most tables with at least one order of this.  2) Shredded chicken pho - this is a variation of pho, cooked with the same flat rice noodles, but the broth is different and with shredded chicken instead of beef.  Also very good and flavourful.  I can confirm they don't serve the typical beef pho here, so go somewhere else if that is what you are looking for.  Cheap, fast and tasty - what more can you ask for?  Don't confuse this location across from Dragon City on Dundas with the one on St. Andrew's near Kensington Market."}
{"text":"I like to promote small restaurants because I know how competitive the market is and how disadvantageous the small place can be without huge marketing budget. I was getting my hair cut in Chinatown and a person works at the salon for a decade recommended me this place, because I was asking for recommendations for Fujian food.   Fujian is a southeastern province in China, famous for seafood and light snacks. There are lots of immigrants from Fujian originally and brought the hometown taste to other countries. Kim Vietnamese restaurant (i believe) is owned by a Chinese-Vietnamese immigrant family. I ordered the Fujian (or Fu kien) inspired rice noodles mixed with yellow thick noodles, and it reminds me the taste of Fujian rich culinary culture as well as Southeast Asian inspiration. Make sure taste some of the homemade garlic sauce with the noodles. That is something I would die for. Also, it is super cheap, less than 10 bucks gets you a full meal."}
{"text":"Love their broth for their Special Fuk-kien Vermicelli and Egg Noodle Soup.  I was not a fan of their dipping sauce for goi cuon (salad roll).  It was oily and bland, but the roll itself was tasty and tightly rolled with all the expected ingredients.  I am not a fan of people using spring mix cause there is no crunch.  Within a week of trying their fuk-kien noodles, I dragged the hubby to join me to try this.  He made a keen observation while there.  He stated that he preferred their slightly smaller bowls of goodness to getting a bigger bowl of bland watered down broth. Their special dried noodle (half rice noodle half egg noodle) was very yummy.  This will become the place I dine if I venture to chinatown with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"A hole on the wall place, but the food makes up for it. Fuk Kien Noodles with shrimp crackers is their best seller. Cha Gio is made with rice roll paper, and that makes a big difference!"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on Yelp, I was determined to try the C2. On a chilly day like today, it really hit the spot! Soooo gooood if you enjoy noodle soup. Also ordered the fresh spring rolls which I absolutely love. And for $11.50 plus tax/tip, you can't go wrong. OMG!   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Is pho a dirty soup? Let's hope it's not!  But everytime I have pho here, it just tastes so much cleaner."}
{"text":"this business is not located at this address; i came looking for it today and walked up and down the block and could not find it. and there's no storefront that looks anything like the photo posted."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese but this place was just OK. I would have given it 2 stars if it wasn't for the super nice lady that works there. They don't serve Pho in the sense that a Westerner would expect. No beef soups except for one choice.  The vegetables in my duck noodle soup was a couple tiny slivers of leaf, a random duck leg, no sprouts, no cilantro or herbs like you might expect elsewhere. The spring rolls were pretty good. The bubbly kind. Too bad. She was such a kind host."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Very good service. Lots of choice. A modest place but because it is around the corner from Spadina, is not as busy as the trendy, more popular (but IMHO not as good) restaurants. Often filled with Vietnamese customers. My daughter (who is fussy) loves the vermicelli dishes, and so do I."}
{"text":"This place has been around since the early 80's and is operated by a Chinese/Vietnamese family, much like my own.  Our family used to come here back in the day, but stopped after someone was shot to death back in the mid to late 80's.  My notes:  1. Their specialty is the fukien noodle soup -- a mix of thick yellow noodles and thin vermicelli noodles topped with a delicious shrimp cracker and amazingly tender pieces of pork.  This will set you back about $6-$7.  I would say that 80% of their business comes from this dish alone. 2. Service was excellent, and the owner liked to chat about my camera and her daughter 3. Interior seems someone recently updated (at least compared to when I came here about two years ago) 4. I am almost 100% sure that they don't serve pho 5. I can't speak of all the other dishes, but reckon you'd only want to go to this place for the fukien noodles  Overall, I definitely need to eat here more often.  The fukien noodles are just too damned delicious to avoid.  It would be a nice spot for a UYE as well.  To steal the \"Obligatory Title Pun\" from Yelp's infamous Vivek S.: This place is to die for (sorry, I couldn't help myself)."}
{"text":"Came here especially for the Vermicelli and Yellow noodle soup with crispy prawn cracker! This place might look old but it gave me a kind of homely feel.  As someone who came from south east Asia, this dish definitely tasted like the food back home. I'm so glad I found this restaurant during my trip in Toronto. Nice comfort food perfect on a chilly day."}
{"text":"I think it's important to note that Kim does not serve pho. This was somewhat disappointing, but overall, the food was quite good. The service, on the other hand, is horrible."}
{"text":"You will not find this place unless you are taken to it or know of it.  It's across the street from Pac mall beside an abandoned house??? haha.  it is a very small restaurant with maybe 10 tables.  If need be you might have to share a table but it's worth it.  i ordered 204 and it was amazing.  the broth had a lot of flavour and the noodles that went with it were great (rice noodles and Kim Po noodles).  The best part of that soup were the pork grinds...yummy.  Order a side dish of it if you love the taste of the fatty pig skin.  Next time i go back i am trying the Pho.  my buddy had it and said it was the best so he has ever had so now i need to go back."}
{"text":"Had a half day tour downtown on a weekday and was originally gonna head to my regular viet place..Anh Dao but they were closed on Wednesday.... boo... so I just yelped to find the next highest rated viet place nearby  and this was the one I stumbled upon...  This is not your typical pho place with selections of rare beef and beef tendons....they had an extreme limited selection of noodles..we asked what the most popular dish was and we were told the fu kian noodle and duck leg noodle so thats what we ended up ordering...  To me, it just seemed like a regular bowl of noodles, soup base wasn't very tasty and hot in temperature..nothing really screamed delicious to mee...so I'm giving this place an A-Ok...  I don't recommend ordering the spring rolls becuz it was drenched in oil and it was just regular, nothing spectacular...   All in all, not a place I would come out of my way to try..."}
{"text":"On a trip to TO, I randomly walked into this run down Vietnamese joint and was very pleased with the noodle salad with egg roll! The egg roll was crispy and delicious! For cad 6.50, it's really a steal!"}
{"text":"A different kind of pho restaurant.  Don't expect the traditional pho.  They mixed different meat, beef, chicken, pork n fish balls in their assorted pho. This is different but I liked because they didn't put in the ??? , omasum; beef honeycomb tripe ?just a personal preference). Their lemongrass chicken is well seasoned n tender. The chicken pho broth is 4/10, too oily. Service is good. A bit run down on interiors but reasonable price."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  This place used to be better, but with the growing of the Kim/Kim Po brand it seems the original branch has been left with the scraps in terms of quality.  The Kim Po brand has always been an underrated Vietnamese restaurant brand, especially when battling with the likes of Linh, Hung, Golden Turtle, Tien Thanh, etc. The best Kim Po branch, in my opinion, is the Scarborough branch on Redlea (across from Pacific Mall). If you're in the downtown area, I suggest to look beyond this place, despite the positive reviews you may see here.  I went with the beef brisket noodles, which is one of their staples along with their fu-kien noodles. Unfortunately, the excellent tomato broth quality that the Scarborough Kim Po branch has (and what this place used to have several years ago) could not be replicated, as the colour of the broth was an unremarkable brown colour instead of it being closer to a red colour. The noodles were okay though.  Service was good for what it's worth. It's a longstanding place, so the restaurant does seem sketchy, but the prices definitely reflect the fact that it's a value place...except there's so many Vietnamese places in the area in the same price range that I would most likely not return here."}
{"text":"So, I guess the Toronto thing is you place the order yourself.  You are given the menu and a sheet  of paper and everyone writes on it what they want.  Seems like a simple idea and a good way to make sure everyone's order it right.  there were 6 of us and another  party of 6 was also seated next to us at the same time.   Both parties order their food roughly around the same time as well.  Our server had an attitude when we wrote down a letter and no number.  Yet, on the menu it just said E and the item proceeding was E1. When we corrected it, she walked off with an attitude as if the bothered her immensly.  After that, most of us that ordered noodle soups got our order quick and my sister and brother who order a rice and vermicelli plate, did not get theirs.  We noticed that the party next to us got their vermicelli plates.  So we follow up and they asked if we had ordered it.  YES, we did!  They come out 10 mins later with them.  Then, they forget our ice coffees and red bean drink.  We didn't get those till after our meals.  Food was ok, nothing too impressive considering the reviews.  Service can be a lil better and making sure everyone has what they ordered.  Not sure how they keep track of it.  overall, ok."}
{"text":"Gotta try the house bowl of noodles, it comes with a shrimp cracker. A must try anytime of the day. I can can enjoy this dish especially in the winter. Great hole in the wall family place!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service and cheap as chips. Not good if you're a vegetarian which is why it lost a star."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I have only eaten at Kim a handful of times in so many years, all of those meals have been very satisfying and most of them extremely memorable.   On one of my first visits, two of us couldn't help but succumb to the nondescript yet somehow tantalizing posters on the wall that advertised the \"fish seven ways\" feast. Although these feasts are suggested for two, I am sure that they mean elephants and not humans.  Dish after dish of fish arrived, done every which way and we ate until we could count no more. That was years ago though, so with the pain of overindulgence long forgotten, we turned many corners, walking south on Spadina, looking for Kim again.  During our most recent visit, for both old time's and curiosity's sakes, we dared order the \"beef seven ways\". With four mouths to feed this time around, we were much more confident and ordered an additional fish hot pot and cook-at-the-table beef rice paper wraps. Although again, this proved to be far too much food, everything was quite good and arrived unbelievably quickly. That's pretty much what you can expect from Kim: quick, good, and cheap to boot!"}
{"text":"Yelp brought me here with my friends to try out. FYI, this place DOES NOT serve traditional pho, but trying out that infamous C2 was definitely worth it. It is a mix of yellow noodles and vermicilli. The toppings include shrimp, flank brisket and many others including a super delicious shrimp cracker (although it was a little oil, I wasn't expecting much from a fried food). It's definitely tasty and I will be coming back to try other dishes as the price was on the cheaper side."}
{"text":"Tried their fuk-kien yellow noodle mixed with vermicelli, came with beef and a shrimp cracker. It was alright did not wow me, it was a little bland though but the price is reasonable $7.50 for a small bowl which I had.   I saw what other people had and it looks more interesting I will try another item next time."}
{"text":"Not many places have the staple of this place (the yellow noodled mixed with vermicelli with a shrimp cracker) and for good reason. This place cannot be beat in that dish! I especially love their hu tieu noodles as well. The broth is so flavourful and rich (umami anyone?) that you'll chase that mouthfeel with any other Vietnamese places you'll try. For the price it can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Their Fukien noodle soup is the signature dish. The best anywhere and a must eat. I've been going here for more than 20 years and it's been the same family owned restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is famous for their Fu kien noodle soup. Not a fancy place to sit and mingle with friends or anything like that; its meant for quick bite to eat and out. Their \"hu tieu\" is so delicious. Broth tastes very home made. I always get the Full kien noodle and ask for the shrimp cake on the side (otherwise it gets soggy inside the soup).  This place has been around forever. It looks dirty and run down from the outside. But the food is so worth the visit"}
{"text":"Waitress was extremely rude. She got really impatient and slapped a paper and pen on the table and told a family of 7 to write down their order. The food is fine. Nothing special. However, I wouldn't come back."}
