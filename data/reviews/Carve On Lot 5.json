{"text":"We make a point of trying out all new restaurants in Brampton, particularly new ones in the downtown.  So we went to Carve with high hopes.....we could not have been more disappointed.

Service was best described as \"amateur\" with basic restaurant \"rules\" broken and feeble excuses given.  This might have been offset with good food...but sadly 2 of the three meals ordered were very poor (one sent back to kitchen and when the other was described to wait staff as \"barely edible\" all we got was a shrug).

Not sure what vibe they are going for here but the high ceiling on the ground floor combined with the lack of any soft fabrics raise the noise level to an almost unbearable level.....so when the band upstairs starts playing (base pounding through the ceiling and vocals streaming down the stairs) the least they could do was turn off whatever background (kindly stated) music they have down there already.

This place left a bad taste in our mouths in more ways than one. :("}
{"text":"After waiting for this opening, which seemed like forever, we were uninspired in the crazy heat to order roast beef, so opted for salmon & salad instead . Went again in the fall . 
Tonight we ordered beef dip sandwiches to go, mine with mac & cheese, lover boy's  with fries. Well done Carve it was delish. Someone remembered to put salt & cheese in the macaroni, the roast beef was very tender and juicy and nice choice of bread. The white cheddar on the sandwiches was delish and brought some nice flavour to the dish that the \"au jus\"  didn't. 
I'd order this again and I'm sure it's even better \"in house\". Cheers"}
{"text":"I just had dinner at the Carve on Lot 5 and was so looking forward to some great roast beef. Unfortunately, this was not the case. First of all the salad had way too much dressing, the mashed potatoes were lumpy and tasteless, vegetables over seasoned and the beef was downright awful. I ordered \"medium\" and it arrived \"well\". As well as being over cooked, it was tough and lacked flavour.  Won't be going back again. This was one of those times that I should have heeded the other customer reviews."}
{"text":"A definite visual standout in the downtown core, this is the kind of restaurant I would hope to see more of in Brampton.

I can only give a superficial review of this place due to the fact that I only attended a breakfast event here and didn't have a chance to go for dinner - I need to remedy that in the future.

There are two different fields of thought here - a restaurant with nice leather seats, high ceilings and a patio that evokes the kind of cool, upscale feel that you'd get at a trendy club in downtown T.O. Then you get to the food and the service, which reminds me a lot of the mentality of a pub-style restaurant like Roc'n Doc's down in Port Credit, where what you get is what you get, and the staff couldn't be bothered to care about customer engagement.

The food I had here (as part of a \"campaign-style\" roundtable event with a politician) was good, but certainly nothing to write home about. You know something's off when the most memorable part of the experience, five months later, is the coffee. I didn't want to give this place less than three stars because the circumstances and quality may have changed drastically since I was last there, and I'd rather go more in-depth if and when I do an update piece on it.

Carve stands out as a beautiful hangout spot and a great patio, but it remains to be seen how the food quality will shake out. As others have said, it's definitely a unique and much-needed presence in the downtown core, and I'd be very interested to go back and see how things have changed in the interim.

Worth a look."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! I had the beef dip and was blown away on the quality of the bread and Prime rib. It literally melts in your mouth. 
Beautiful decor and amazing service top this gem off."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here recently and while it was overall decent, it wasn't quite as good as I expected, either. I'd heard mixed reviews, mostly that the food was good and the service was a bit slow. That was exactly my experience. The servers were incredibly gracious, but perhaps a little overburdened. 

As far as the food, I have a pretty adventurous palate, and this place doesn't quite fit that bill. The food was well made and I can see the care that went into it -- and I applaud the owner and staff for this. Indeed, we made contact with the owner that night and had a really good chat about our food and about the restaurant. I really appreciated that, and that is why I'll be back to give it a second try when patio season kicks in. 

The interior of the restaurant is clean and warm. I used to go there when it was Green Cup Roastery, and it's vastly different. They've really cleaned up the place and made it into a pleasant place to spend an evening.

Verdict: If you like regular roast beef and roast chicken type food, then this is a good, comfy spot to go. Also, they have a rooftop patio which I haven't been to yet, and my expectation is that must be pretty awesome. Can't wait to check that out!"}
{"text":"There were a couple things off in my first visit, but they were fairly minor. On our recent return there were issues with virtually everything ordered. We started with wings and right off the bat, a warning sign was only being about 8 wings. That wouldn't be an issue if these were the larger sized wings, however these were the very small kind which was very poor value. They came out in a timely way, but were somehow overcooked, quite dry and not very hot. I can only assume that means they were either reheated or kept in a warming tray. The 'blue cheese' dip had the oil separated from the cream on top with parts floating in the oil, which means it's cheap and not likely properly stored.

We would've sent these back, but we had already sent back the parm fries which weren't hot and that my wife was starving. They also were served within minutes, but since they weren't hot I'd have to assume they weren't cooked to order. At least the fries that came back out were fresh and properly cooked (they were overcooked on my first visit). We did mention the wings to the waitress so that she was aware however. The dip alone should've been a major cause of concern.

I went with the roast beef dish since I wanted to explore more of their 'carved' features. I realize a roast is cooked much earlier in the day, but somehow there are clearly methods restaurants have to keeping it juicy and tasting fresh when plating. This roast was more like if you arrived late for a family Sunday dinner: still okay tasting, but not terribly warm and past it's prime.

In spite of the poor review, I'm still hoping that this place will do well since the community needs something like this. With that said, I can't presently recommend the place since there's obviously issues with the kitchen and they really need more discipline in that regard. I'll come again a little down the road hoping things are sorted out."}
{"text":"Another gem in Downtown Brampton that deserves a lot more love. I went a few weeks ago with a friend and we both wanted to come back again. Good food, friendly servers, and diverse bar menu. The biggest thing for me was how we were greeted by the owner and how we genuinely felt like she wanted our business. It's not to say they were kissing our a** or anything, but it's rare that restaurants go above and beyond to make sure you know about the restaurant and make a strong enough impression for future patronage. I hope they survive to summer time as the roof top patio is a rare feature in Brampton."}
{"text":"We are regulars here. My husband and I have tried all sorts of items in the menu, never a disappointment. The one time we did have an issue the item was whisked away, returned fixed and was delicious. A dessert was kindly offered and we accepted...oh wow. So good. The service is earnest and friendly. The owner is so kind and has built a beautiful and enjoyable space in a restored gorgeous piece of downtown. We have been here with a larger group, and everything was great. The upstairs patio is really nice and offers a great view of the sunset in Brampton. The only warning would be ...be prepared to wait if you go on a Rose theatre event night as they are packed and the wait can be long. We love it here.  If you have any issues, bring it to their attention and it's fixed!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for my first lunchtime meal. Good burger, decent beer selection, great new look for a historic location. They've poured tons of money into the revocations make this a sturdy, fresh looking building. Wonderful seating on two floors and a rooftop patio that is unrivaled in Brampton. Great staff."}
{"text":"First off this place sucks - I'm a foodie & have tried PLENTY of restaurants. This was a mistake 

Upon arriving my friend & requested the patio as it seems to be the talk of the town and the ONLY rooftop patio in Brampton right?! We were told it's at capacity & there would be a 40 minute wait. We took a quick peek at the menu and decided to settle for indoor which was bland to say the least. Fairly mixed crowd, quiet - no music(that I could hear at least), crowded/seating, bare walls, no colour etc etc. There are a couple really cool pieces of art on the wall of old downtown brampton. My friend and I agreed that maybe they should have a little blurb underneath to explain the history or at least tell us what year that photo was taken.

I decided to try my luck and ask a second time about the patio seeing as we noticed more than a handful of people leaving from the upstairs. The server who I asked said she would check then disappeared for quite awhile. She came back and asked myself and my friend if someone had been to help us yet? I reminded her that SHE had already seated us and promised to check on the patio situation, so for the second time she left to check. Lucky/unlucky for us there was a seat for two... and then some, so I was a little confused as to why we were told 40 minutes out the gate.
Patio was cute with much more potential than downstairs but there were no heaters and it was a little chilly. Our server messed up on the drinks to start with, but she was sweet and apologetic. Halfway through the drink we decided to move back in as it was quite cold.
We were seated upstairs on the second level between the patio and downstairs, which again was bland and not being used to its full potential. There is a fireplace stationed directly to your right as soon as you reach the top step coming from the first level which is beyond me because its an awkward place near the stairs and there are no tables there so no-one is going to feel that heat - genius. There are about 4 different types of chairs at the tables which looks tacky as well. 
My friend ordered the \"jerk chicken sandwich\" which was overcooked, underseasoned, came on a ROCK hard ciabatta bun... boring.
I ordered the \"shaami kabob chicken sliders\" & \"parmesan dusted fries\". The server brought me out mac & cheese instead of the fries which was quickly and easily corrected. Sliders were disgusting. So overcooked, so dry, so gross. Parm fries were Terrible. Really dry and cold! Burnt from the grease, and no Parmesan? 
When leaving; my friend and I saw 3 chefs come outside the back for a smoke break. The one guy came over to us to compliment my friends bike... and he was clearly strung out. Drunk or high? Maybe no sleep from partying the night before? Either way it made sense why my food was so shit.

All in all this place has SO much potential to be the new happening spot for brampton/downtown brampton. Its a great location and there is ample room inside to work with, unfortunately the owner/management doesn't see it the same way. Its as simple as throwing a tea light on the table, dim the lights slightly, change the music genre/volume to create an ambiance. I'm really not even sure what kind of vibe they are going for here, its quite awkward. 
This place used to be a dope cafe with an art gallery upstairs - too bad, so sad.
Needless to say I will not be returning to this spot, its way too bland and crap food."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try a different non chain restaurant in Brampton for a change... Been eyeing this restaurant since the summer to try the roof top patio.. Never had a chance tho.. But came tonight to try it for the first time.. And I really enjoyed it.. Had the chicken bites with honey garlic.. It's like boneless wings but very tasty.. Also had the Paella which was full of flavors.. The wife had her chicken sandwich and that was delicious and spicy. Then we had the crème brule and the turtle cheesecake.. Pretty good.. Not to sweet which I like...
Prices are pretty good..
Definitely will come back with friends soon.. And want to try the roof top patio in the spring.."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on 12/09/16 at around 1:30pm. We opted for the patio as I wanted to enjoy the last bit of summer weather before the chill of winter sets in and at 21 degrees it was pleasant.
The patio area is a small space with some very basic patio tables and chairs, but it's a beautiful space with definite design promise. I truly look forward to it's cabana like feel being utilized in the future with some soft curtains, sectionals and some more conversational sets. The other two levels do require the same soft touch of accents to bring the spaces together, but as this is a new restaurant I am forgiving and look forward to it's aesthetic evolution in the years to come.
As for the food we ordered the charcuterie platter, steak and fries, Asiago Penne and the pork belly Mac n cheese.
The charcuterie platter was fantastic and a wonderful start to our meal. The cheese, meats, grilled peaches and walnuts worked so well together. I can not praise this enough, every bite was simply delicious. Very well executed.
I am not a fan of to much salt and found the steak to be generously salted, but the meat was moist and delicious, the parmesan fries were delicious... but once more a bit too salty for my taste. It unfortunately came with no veggies and I felt that could have added to decreasing the impact of the salt, if there were a side of slightly sweet veggies to pair with the other items on the plate. Overall it was a good dish, but not as exceptional as I had hoped.
The Penne with chicken was generously salted as well and with the cheese it certainly made for a heavily salted dish, but again this is just my preference. The dish itself was flavourful and the pasta was cooked perfectly. My bf enjoyed it and had no complaints, he felt there was enough cheese and veggies and just the right amount of seasoning that suited his taste.
The Mac n cheese was superb, the crispy pork belly with the soft pasta made for a wonderful combination. 
Desserts... definitely room for improvement, there was pretty much no custard to my Caribbean tart, I had expected mango custard and got mango chunks, though tasty was no custard. I truly dislike deconstructed foods. I wanted a lovely creamy custardy tart, not a bowl of fruit and crumbled crust, so I felt really disappointed by this dessert. The cheesecake was overpowering with cream cheese, I felt it was not executed as well as it could have been. The S'more Brownie was amazing and it will certainly be my go to next time. I certainly see lots of potential for this restaurant.
It reminds me of pub faire. The menu is small but varying enough to suit differing taste buds.
I certainly would return to try their other items as I believe the patio menu did not have a few of the appetizers (sliders etc).
I look forward to the growth of this restaurant as it has potential to be one of the best in Brampton. Serving staff are lovely and do their best, that I can appreciate (especially when scaling 2 flights of impressive stairs)"}
{"text":"Tried this place out a few nights ago. We chose to sit on the rooftop patio as well and be prepared for some stairs, haha, as can be expected.
I found the atmosphere up there nice, for a small party, I wouldn't recommend a large group for the patio as space is limited. 
The hostess was extremely positive and smiley, which was nice, the wine list was alright as well. May have been (slightly) overpriced but there was a good selection of whites and reds to choose from. 
The menu is great, especially for people with gluten free needs and vegetarians and vegans alike. My partner got the curry bowl and was delighted with it. The portion was quite large and the taste was quite nice as well. (I tried a little) I got the Shrimp Paella and it was amazing. The rice was cooked perfectly, not soggy and with just the right consistency. The spices were incredible and the shrimp didn't taste rubbery. 
I will be back here to try other dishes soon."}
{"text":"As is the usual with new restauranteurs, the owners of Carve have completely neglected any thought to creating a space, ambience, or proper acoustics. 

Our party of 4 was there for dinner two nights ago and we had to cup our hands to our ears to hear each other.
This negates any other consideration of the restaurant: food, service, price etc.
Doesn't matter if the food is amazing: if the space is unbearable, the best food in the world won't save it.

As it turns out, the food was unremarkable. 
The service was forgettable. Someone needs to teach servers not to handle glasses by the rim - that's where you put your mouth - but by the body of the glass. 
And don't attempt to clear plates when others at the table are still eating. That's a huge no-no.

They also don't seem to have any sort of dress code: the place was full of people who don't seem to understand that one removes one's shitty baseball cap when indoors and when in the presence of ladies.

I couldn't possibly recommend it."}
{"text":"I came here thinking this was place would be the next big thing in Brampton, but I was sadly mistaken. The rooftop wasn't what I expected you have to take a flight up the stairs and it was quite small. I ordered rum they gave me vodka instead. My parm fries were soggy and undercooked, my burger was basic and burnt. The food here is horrible but the staff is very friendly. Come here at your own risk."}
{"text":"If I could rate this rate this restaurant less than 1 star, I would. I've never been in a restaurant that has been this disorganized, ever.

Beyond having to wait for a table to be set in a near empty restaurant, and the seat staff not knowing what tables were available without having to personally go upstairs and come back down, I should have known to leave then. The menu was fairly uninspiring, and the food of my neighbour's was presented like a whopper from burger king.  Having been asked by the same server whether i had been helped placing an order 3 times, all threes times with the same answer of no, a young server finally came to my beckon! Going past my judgement and her lack of knowledge of what was behind the bar, I managed to order a drink and settled with the 'Jerk' sandwich...I was confused if whether that was a description of the chef who made it, or if that was supposed to be the seasoning used on the sandwich. It was flavourless and loaded in what seemed like Mayonnaise, an interesting choice for a jerk sandwich. The bread, as mentioned in another review, was stale and hard to bite in to. I'm not sure if they had a dessert menu, as after waiting 20 minutes for the table to be cleared, i decided to just ask for the bill. 

The mish-mash of furniture, utensils, salt and pepper shakers (missing at most tables) made it feel like it was laid out by an amateur, or on a budget that didn't quite fit for new furniture. It's a pity as this restaurant is taking up a great location, and has the word 'potential' written all over it. If the owner reads reviews: Toss your menu, Train / hire some experienced staff, and pick one style of furniture for the room! Brampton needs more quality non-franchised restaurants with personality...just pick a different personality!"}
{"text":"If you live in Brampton don't waste your time coming here just because it's the only
Roof top patio restaurant around, your better off taking the extra drive downtown Toronto . The food was horrible , the waitresses are nice but everyone is rushing . We got our appetizer first the beef yorkie bowls and it was cold , but good and then waited basically an hour for the food . I got the seafood linguini and although it was loaded with sauce which I like , it was not  seasoned well to cut the fresh fishy taste from the scallops , mussels and shrimp in the pasta. My boy friend had the mac n cheese cubed pork belly which was pretty bland and not creamy at all , but to make it worse the mashed potatoes were clearly box made potatoes if not worse . Aside from the waitresses being nice , we waited long for everything . We waited forever to be seated , then to get get our drinks and place our order and even to get our bill . It seems a little under staffed, hence the rush feeling."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place. It is delicious! We went on Sunday night, the restaurant was empty at 9pm so we had the whole place to ourselves! The waitress was so nice and gave us a quick tour, and the patio looked fabulous but the weather was not fit for it. 

We had the meat platter but neither of us was hungry. It blew our minds! The flavours were mind blowing! It had a kick in most of the dishes and if not, there is always spicy mayo that was served on the plate. 

This is probably a hidden gem on the city that I have not read reviews about! It is definitely the best thing we tried in Brampton! I can't wait to visit more often when I'm more hungry!"}
