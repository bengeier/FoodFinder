{"text":"So sad this place had to close...hopefully something even cooler opens to take it's place."}
{"text":"Is this really a socialist heaven? Homemade onion rings and a personal jukebox at every table!

This place is small, so always packed - with good reason."}
{"text":"$19 for two people to have an ample breakfast! The location is pretty small, but the food is solid and thus Saturday morning line. Total nostalgia with the beaver-panel walls and table-top jukeboxes (I didn't have any quarters to see if they still worked). Reminds me of a cleaner and more polite Vesta Lunch.

Tasty and fluffy french toast, actually over-easy over-easy eggs without runny whites, perfect bacon (microwaved, I'm pretty sure, just crispy enough, not too much fat with enough for flavour, and dear god what flavour), standard breakfast sausages. Coffee wasn't bad (I'm no connoisseur) and it kept on coming. 

Honestly, I love being served in a diner by a man wearing a neat business shirt and snazzy tie. There is no bad here."}
{"text":"Cool little place, perfect eggs 'n onions, great home fries.  What else can I say?  (Wife's \"over easy\" were perfect.)

Saturday at 9:15 am, no crowd at all.

Edit;  Back with friends on a Monday at 9:15.  Still good.  D.O. decided to have onion rings for dessert.  They make 2 trays of these from scratch every day. (see photo)  Yum.  Unfortunately, today's order came just after 12 guys came in, took up 3 booths (literally half the restaurant) and placed 12 orders.  The rings came back a tad overdone (see other photo), which we attributed to the rush.  Really though, they were a bit bland.  Very high batter:onion ratio."}
{"text":"Old-style diner. Clean, cute tiny little place with breakfast all day. 
Solid place either for breakfast, a greasy hangover cure, or both.

The staff are friendly and I somehow get a \"small-town\" vibe from this place (in a good way). Decent food.

As one person said, \"there is no wrong here.\" Spot on.

No credit or debit accepted but they have an ATM in the musty basement/hallway that connects to but isn't part of the diner"}
{"text":"Yup, this is just another greasy spoon with a busted sign out front, but it's got an authentic, nostalgic feel to it that I found comforting while waiting for my take-out order. Maybe the 4 star rating is partly because we were ravenously hungry, and I couldn't fill my food hole fast enough by the time we got home, with the burger, fries and rings replacing all conscious thought until every last morsel was consumed, but whatever, it was awesome. The wife and I exchanged a look afterwords, one that expressed quiet thanks that this restaurant was close, but not too close."}
{"text":"This is my favourite breakfast place in all of Toronto! Now I have to admit that in all the times that I have eaten at Peoples I have never strayed away from my 2 eggs over easy, bacon, hash browns (well done of course), white toast and coffee. So if you are looking for a detailed critique of the menu sorry to disappoint you. 

Peoples Food is a wonderful throwback to the day where the division between the customer and the people working behind the counter was more of a family relationship. I can happily say that the proprietors of Peoples Food, Kathy and Nick are two of the sweetest people you would ever want to meet. They welcome you as you walk in and feed you with a smile. 

Peoples Food is not the sexiest place to eat in Toronto, but it always feels like home."}
{"text":"I figured a diner would be the fastest meal we could get on a Saturday morning. Not this diner! It's tiny and super popular. We were extremely fortunate to beat the rush and get the last bar stools last Saturday because everyone after us had to wait in the doorway.

I can see why they wait. This is an old-school diner of the finest form. I especially loved sitting at the counter, with the nice gentleman who served drinks (don't try to give him your order!) standing at attendance in his shirt and tie. Everything tasted exactly as you'd expect, and nothing disappointed. My cohorts had egg plates, and I enjoyed my mushy melty grilled cheese and tomato, and shared my large plate of steak fries, which were browned perfectly.

On our way out, the 2 cooks, the waiter and the man in the tie all waved and smiled in farewell. Check out People's Food. This diner is an institution!"}
{"text":"Awesome little diner.

Pros: 

Friendliest staff in the world.
Awesome food.
Huge menu.
Best bacon & eggs in the neighbourhood.


Cons:

Tiny, limited seating.
Long wait times to get in.
Slow-ish service.


Overall it's my go-to place on the weekends for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Any place with Al's Diner Aurthur Fonzerelli type juke boxes at each table is good in my books.
This greasy spoon is a diner with character, and grease.  So long as you don't try to bring out the HK Princess you've been dating, any rational human would enjoy a solid breakie here."}
