{"text":"Thanks for taking almost 2 hrs to deliver my food. At least it was hot. You never answered the phone when I called 2 times, very unprofessional.  I've asked just eat to refund my tip (wish the whole thing could be refunded), you guys didn't even offer anything for the troubles. Now on to the food which pretty much sucked. Panzo  = undercooked,  couldn't add extra toppings,  was only able to get cheese or pep. Your special fries, try using real Parm not that crap you get at the grocery store that's pre shredded. Wings were edible but the sauce sucked hard and hardly extra hot. We haven't tried the salad that we were forced to buy chicken with, going with that will suck too. So thanks for nothing.  Won't be ordering again. First time customer = last time customer."}
{"text":"Not a great experience.  Bought a slice of pepperoni and cheese which was very good but when I returned and bought a pizza it was awful.  The pizza was dry, very little sauce and there were sections that had no cheese.  It was very disappointing after such a good experience with the slice.  Will go back for slices but when I order next time it will be from Big House Pizza which is one block to the East."}
{"text":"This place was where the gino pizza use to be. Right across the street from square boys. Tough competition but I got say I did like this places burger better.  I had the red dice burger which is regular burger but cheese melted into bun on both side. Sound good. They have 4 and 6 but it's only about dollar between the two size and whole meal with the combo was 10 dollars.   Now I know what you are thinking if it cheap food, can't really be special. It was flavorful and good. I would eat it again. I also had a slice of pizza, and it was good. I think everything is homemade. Including the chicken wings which I have yet to try.  This place has a wide selection but so far between the pizza and burger I loved it and its a good value. I guess squarebiy will have to take a backseat to this place, atleast in my books."}
