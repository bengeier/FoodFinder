{"text":"So excited about this place! North Scottsdale was in dire need of an upscale eatery that's kid friendly. I loved being able to have a glass of wine while my kids were kept busy playing corn hole:)"}
{"text":"The outdoor area is beautiful and the bocce and bags make the wait fun. Nice salad menu - love the Asian chop salad and steak salads."}
{"text":"I finally went to the new Vig. The building is sweet but the patio is even sweeter. They said that titos was on special for the summer so my drinks were only 4 dollars a piece. Couldn't believe it in Scottsdale. The wings were good, bartender was cool. I'll come back in the winter for the patio."}
{"text":"The star goes for beautiful views!!! However, the Classic hamburgers, were DISGUSTING!!! I must say McDonalds hamburgers beats there hamburgers ?the cole slaw was dried out and tasteless!   French fries were too thin.  They really need to over haul their Menu!   VERY DISAPPOINTING! MCDonalds beats them 10 to 1!!"}
{"text":"I've been here four times and I'm done \"giving it another try.\" The first time we went, we sat for 45 minutes after putting in the food order and finally asked.... \"how much longer?\" to find out the order was never put in. The manager made it right and gave us a gift card to come back. We did, it was unremarkable, so was the 3rd visit. I went back today for a mid-afternoon lunch and sat indoors. Again, the food and service were mediocre... but the acoustics are horrible. It was loud as hell in there and impossible to hear my hubby sitting across the table. I suggest sitting outside if you go, and set your expectations for food and service low... maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Love their out door space!  Fish tacos were great!  Was there for Happy Hour and planning to go back for dinner maybe brunch."}
{"text":"First of all the service from the hostess to the wait staff was the best :-).  The location and layout is great with a large sprawling patio.  In the cooler months it will be ideal.  Under the \"special dishes\" I've had the fish tacos and Pad Thai.  They were just OK.  I've had much better Pad Thai at several local Thai restaurants.  The friends that dined with me had a couple different burgers who thought they were fine so I may come back and try a burger because the location is very convenient.   What was cool is they had a locked room set up for hikers and bikers to store their stuff while they eat- I've never seen that."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good and great happy hour specials. Happy they blended into our desert neighborhood and support the hikers and bikers.  This week with the heat being so intense I expected it would be nice and cool inside!  Not so much tonight. They need to have their AC inspected. I expected more from a newly constructed place.  Aside,  love the yard and social environment they promote."}
{"text":"The vig is always our go to for awesome food and an amazing experience and this location did not disappoint!! Architecturally, it is the best location by far, it's beautiful and spacious. If you are looking for a delicious meal and a relaxing place to hang out, look no further!"}
{"text":"Great music, great atmosphere. Patio area relaxing. Live music soothing. Our service today was subpar. Not very busy. Our food was forgotten, no \"Hello\" for too long, appetizer never came out, our food got cold before we even got sides to go with it, we requested syrup and the waitress finally brought out a tiny ramekin 1/4 full of syrup. Lastly, as I'm writing this our table has been waiting for ages on a dessert. Bummer. In town visiting a pal and we had other options for brunch."}
{"text":"Nice place but super slow service... it is not busy right now....    All 3 meals (3 of us)... pure salt... seriously lousy food...  Come here to drink... NOT EAT."}
{"text":"Opening night at the VIG and it was a great experience.  Our waiter Michael was awesome!  It was very busy but the service we had was superior!  We ordered their wings, pozole soup and pad Thai.  Everything was exceptional including the service!  Will be back many more times!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than 1 star I would. How is the service so horrible when you have at least 14 out on the floor?  Also, the food took over 45 minutes to get, our server didn't come out for at least 30 minutes after we consumed our drinks to refresh our drink orders, we never got napkins/utensils after asking for them multiple times (we had to get them ourselves), and we didn't receive our entire food order. The only positive thing is that the food was good...once we got it. As an MMR resident for 19 years, I don't think I'll be coming back. I'd rather travel 30 minutes and receive better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place, I'm so happy to finally have a superb restaurant so close by!! I have been there 5 times, most recently last night!  Great customer service and food every time!!  We sat at the bar last night and just want to say thank you to the super awesome bartenders: Mark, Chris, Britney, and Loni, they provided great customer service and helped make it a fun night celebrating a birthday!!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch after 1pm when I knew it wouldn't be crowded as hell like after work. Had the Bleu burger with onion rings. Burger was thick and delicious, got mine medium rare. However it was a bit minimalist. The cheese dressing was good and added a nice flavor dimension. Bistro prices, nothing on the menu caught my eye except the bleu burger. $20 for poke salad? Everything else seemed normal and safe for the vanilla Scottsdale masses including the beer list. Nothing extreme, everything a gourmet shade of yellow except two beers, Kiltlifter and Guinness. Service was perfect in every way! I hope service is fast when it's packed. I don't think the inventor of the menu has ever been horny enough to have sex in a utility closet, or the menu would be more adventurous. Vanilla place for vanilla people."}
{"text":"Great service. Bar tenders were fun! Took really good care of us. The atmosphere is amazing"}
{"text":"LOUD LOUD LOUD Very beautiful building. Fits in perfectly with the surroundings. Very well thought out.. except.. it is amusingly loud. Like being at a frat party except it's the scottsdale usuals , but shouting at each other, which is good people watching. Food is great, service is coming along for a just opened store. Hire a sound person and put something that absorbs noise inside. Tip - humans  do not absorb noise equivalent to the amount they make.  Best of luck. I WILL BE BACK! (Shouting)"}
{"text":"The outside area is awesome! I've never had a complaint about their food here. The food is right on point! The surroundings are awesome! Bags at night with your friends outside and a few drinks is cool. Semi casual dining. Drinks are good and where they should be price wise. Deducted a star for loosing my credit card when the bill was brought back. First time in over 10 visits."}
{"text":"Patio was very comfortable in the 105 heat. Good service & enjoyed our strawberry salad & a bbq short rib melt. Glad we checked it out, will take our friends there."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a girlfriend there today. She had the great turkey sandwich. I ordered the chicken sandwich. Both sandwiches came with fries. We changed to veggies for an upcharge. I had char broccoli which to me were extremely limp, so limp and soft, I couldn't stab them with my fork. The sandwiches was wonderful. Service was very good. Not the place to catch up with friends, pretty loud. Hard to hear my girlfriend."}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown ( Fillmore ) location and enjoyed it, so it made sense that when my friend suggested we take the motorcycle up to McDowell Mountain I'd say, \"let's do it\".    This Vig location is really quite nice, the patio area has REALLY effective misters ( to the point where it actually became chilly ) so if you want to hang outside in the afternoon it's a great choice.  The staff is friendly and engaging, seem happy to have you there.    We started with our usual libation, Angry Orchard: always refreshing to us on a hot day. T later tried the Bennet & Bubbles, consisting of Tito's vodka, hibiscus syrup and rhubarb bitters and sparkling wine.   As appetizers I chose the calamari, which was pretty tasty.  T had the artichoke, kale and jalapeño dip with chips - also pretty damn good.   Overall I'd say this is a place I'd happily come back to on a regular basis. It's definitely worth a look.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"Swanky, upscale feel with underwhelming & mediocre food. Service was overly attentive sitting at the bar, borderline pushy. Overpriced, I'm assuming because of location. Has an O.H.S.O Brewery & The Yard/Culinary Dropout feel, but not as inviting. Valet parking seems a bit much, when there is more than enough self-parking to go around."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance.  We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were very friendly.  As it got busier, we did get less attention.  The mac and cheese was disappointing.  It came out cold and dry - not much cheese on it.  My husband's burger looked great but he said it didn't have much flavor...not much seasoning on it.  I had the turkey sandwich which was pretty good.  They did replace my mac and cheese with sweet potato fries which were good, and took out the charge for the sandwich.  This was a very nice surprise and gesture.  Overall I like the place and probably will go back, but most likely for happy hour and not for dinner."}
{"text":"We had Britney today, who told us she goes by B because it's simple to remember! (How cute!) the service was phenomenal, attentive and unique. She really connected with us and made us laugh the entire time. She made great suggestions on the food and cocktails. We loved everything she suggested. The happy hour menu is really well priced, I hope it's seasonal!   The restaurant was beautiful as a whole. Even though it was quite noisy! I cannot wait for fall. I know the patio will be such a hotspot. This is so close to where we live and I know we will be here quite regularly. The hostesses were friendly and very accommodating and the managers seemed to be very much a part of the whole experience and make sure everyone was taken care of! I'll definitely be returning with more friends."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, once without our toddler and once with him. Both times have been a blast! Night one we just came for drinks and the patio was gorgeous. Night two we came for dinner with another family (three kids total). We came right at 5:00 and didn't have to wait at all. After dinner we headed to the patio to play bags and bocce ball. Food was delicious and we had a great time. Will totally be back here. This area has needed a restaraunt like this for a long time!"}
{"text":"Came and visit this place the first time since my boyfriend and I were looking for a place to hang out and drink a little. We were looking for something different that we don't see in California. The customer service was great. Everybody was friendly and accommodated are needs. Food was great. I thought my drink was a little strong and they made it right to my taste. The soy garlic edamame was good."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first time there. Initially put in for a table of 4 but a larger turnout required a table for 8. Staff accommodated our needs without any additional delay.  Menu was okay. Not great but certainly adequate; though the poke bowl was delicious. This place was packed on a hot summer Saturday night in July so I can only imagine what it's like during snowbird season. As with any popular bar hangout, you're going to get your pushy and obnoxious (i.e. drunk!) people. But there is an air of upscale to the establishment so you won't see the tatted-up dudes and dudettes with git-er-done tank tops.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I arrived at 3:30, wasnt that busy.  I got my first drink in about 10 mins and i was sitting at the bar, not full.  My friend arrived, it took 20 mins for hers ... she had to flag down the bartender to get hers.  More people filled the bar. Our drinks were empty and no one asked us if we wanted a refill.  Again, we had to wave down a bartender, it took 30 mins.  They are completely understaffed.  We had to flag down bartender again to order appetizers, They arrived, and the food was average. It was so HOT in there, it didn't feel like the AC  was on.  We were literally dripping with sweat.  Not to impressed."}
{"text":"Moved just down the street.  Staff and management could not be friendlier.  Our first night moving here Luke took great care of us when I rolled up in a uhaul.  Ranging from Luke. Kelsey, Josh, to Soto they make you feel like family here.  Great managament and great staff makes this our go to spot.  They are always willing to turn the tv to our favorite game and always have our favorite beer ready.  A classy establishment with your local waterning hole friendliness and charm makea this our go to.  Always delivers top notch beer, spirits, and food.  Thank you The Vig McDowell Mountain you have special staff."}
{"text":"If you enjoy eating/drinking in a daycare center filled with screaming children running wild and unattended while their parents tip back some cold drinks, this is the place for you! The outdoor area, while beautiful, is unusable as it is so overrun with wailing, screaming toddlers that it becomes a playpen to corral the children whose parents apparently would prefer to drink themselves into oblivion rather than teach their children how to behave in public. A few months ago, I'm lucky to have avoided losing an eye as we were sitting in the adirondack  chairs adjacent the bocce ball area. While we, as two adults, were enjoying a glass of wine, an unruly child who had been climbing up the rocks repeatedly which were marked as \"do not climb on\" picked up a handful of landscaping rocks and threw them at my face, hitting me and the back of my chair. Fortunately, I was turned slightly sideways speaking to my husband so I was only hit in the cheek, and not the eye. The child's parents finally appeared after I jumped up in shock and realized that my husband had left to seek a manager. Otherwise, I would doubt that they would have looked up from their meal! The manager offered to comp us which we politely declined and then said that they really can't do anything about it as people had ripped them on Yelp as not being family friendly so they basically have no choice but to let everyone's kids run wild.  The bottom line is that this is an incredibly unpleasant place for anyone who wants a typical bar/restaurant environment and also should be a hotspot on the Scottsdale Police Dept's radar to bust all of the SUV's leaving with intoxicated parents for child endangerment."}
{"text":"So happy that the Vig finally opened in the neighborhood. I have had nothing but fantastic service. Jessie, has been a server of mine multiple times now (yes..I've been to the vig a number of times since opening...like I said it's in walking distance from my house) and she is probably the best servers I've had in all of Scottsdlae. She has always been attentive and on top of what our needs have been. Adore her and always request for her section.   I do feel that there is some help needed in the kitchen, but again, the vig is only a month old. And I know great things are coming!!    Some great bartenders are there too!! Marc, Tim, Justin and Brit are very attentive.  Thanks for opening in the neighborhood and I am sure I will see you this week!"}
{"text":"Great quick service and professional by our waiter Dejen. Always with a smile and knowledgeable of the menu and detail items.  Great location and super close to where we live.  Breath of fresh air.  Had the wings and they were great."}
{"text":"Ok. Time to tell it like it is. We live two miles from The Vig and have gone there regularly.  We have spent many Sunday afternoons watching Elvis Before Noon at The Vig in Arcadia and were thrilled that the The Vig was moving to our neighborhood. However, ever since their arrival the service has sucked. We visit The Vig regularly and are constantly delayed, neglected by the bar staff and forced to wait on seats due to hostess errors. We now count five visits in a row with errors. The manager has been gracious but I don't need free drinks, I need better service. The most recent delay was bc the hostess could not handle a simple cell phone change. Other delays I suspect are bc we are being avoided by bartenders, who prefer the cool trendy crowd to the middle aged regulars, who live in the neighborhood and have the cash to be regulars if we were treated better. So... if you are cool trendy hot person, The Vig is for you but if you are an established middle aged Scottsdale regular with good income, you will be neglected. The Vig needs to understand that the trendy crowd will move to the next trendy place and start giving better service to the neighborhood regulars. We have had enough of this place and will gladly go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome addition to north Scottsdale food scene!  Great vibe and views of Mcdowell mountains.  Food was solid and team went out of their way to accommodate our group.  Been there many times since opening and looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible and the staff is rude. The food was just simply mediocre at best. I gave the place a couple of tries, thinking it was just having issues getting people trained at first. Still nothing has changed. The place has a nice atmosphere including a great back courtyard, only If you want to be surrounded by screaming kids that are climbing the walls and running around the place. This place is practically a daycare center for the kids of arrogant assed low class Scottsdale people."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, but way OVERPRICED, drinks were SMALL AND WEAK and service was UNCARING and IMPERSONAL.  So much potential with the beautiful facility and location but a definite letdown.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Smallest salad I ever ate for $17. Not even fresh. Been to other Vig restaurants  Much better! Would not recommend SCOTTSDALE On bell and Thompson peak"}
{"text":"We went to dine the 2nd week it was open, it was very very busy and long waits for tables. We just happen to get lucky and a table in the bar opened up. They don't take reservations or take names for a wait list. Our food was excellent and the service superb. Tacos great and mini tapas very tasty. Will check it out again in September."}
{"text":"This is a decent spot for lunch. We went to the McDowell Mtn location. They have a great patio with mountain views. I ordered the grilled chicken BLT. The chicken was moist and tasted good. I chose mac-n-cheese as my side. OMG...it was fabulous! I'm definitely ordering that as a main course if I go back again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautifully done as is the patio. Sat outside in 115 and industrial strength misters kept us comfortable.     Service was disappointing. We were ignored for 10 minutes after being seated until we flagged down the water guy to get some attention.  Food is average.  Can get same Calamari from grocery store freezer aisle.  Chicken blt was good- not great.  Sam Fox joints need not feel threatened."}
{"text":"Love this beautiful location! I love the warm cozy atmosphere and the good vibes of this place.  Tasty food, perfect adult beverages, and lots of people watching. The decor and ambiance of this spot is perfect for a chill date night! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere! The food was delish and our server was friendly and attentive to our needs! We have been to all of the Vig locations and this one did not disappoint !"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood and much needed! Great staff and ambiance! Perfect for casual gathering and Happy Hour gets quite lively. Ask for GM Stewart and tell him Croft sent ya and that you saw this review on Yelp! He'll love it! He does an excellent job running the place and making sure everyone is having a great time."}
{"text":"I have been to three Vig's. They are all good and all different.  This one has a fun vibe with indoor and outdoor seating.  There is corn hole and lounge type tables outside and regular tables inside.  The strawberry salad is fantastic. Wine by the glass is a bit pricy for the quality but over all great expereince."}
{"text":"The Vig USED to be the place to go. They had corn hole, their food is DELICIOUS, the drinks are well poured and there were other options for your kids to move about the grass freely while you enjoyed your meal and the sun.  Now that someone is suing them for some incidents  due to lack of parental vision (in this era of the victim), they no longer allow anyone under 21 to play with the corn hole, the kids are not allowed to roam freely in the appointed open play areas, and the entire vibe is ruined. I am broken hearted to report, The Vig jumped the shark.    Reject your sense of injury, and the injury itself disappears.  - Marcus Aurelius"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time and was sorely disappointed. I ordered a Diet Coke which was flat and a burger medium well that was completely burnt on the outside. Every bite tasted like char."}
{"text":"Totally overrated. Screaming kids. Hostess rude. Tell you one thing when you call on wait list. Get there & it's another amount of time. Clearly did not phase the manager or hostess--smirk on managers face while trying to talk to him. Yuk!"}
{"text":"The new vig is awesome! We had a great server and enjoyed our time! We had just missed happy hour but our drinks and apps were great. The overall feel of the restaurant is the best part! Huge outdoor area, and lots of windows so you feel like you're outside even when sitting in the bar!"}
{"text":"Hey, I love the Vig Arcadia. I would go there all the time if it was closer. Great food, cool place, good atmosphere, and the best band on Sunday. I even had my birthday party there, with people driving all the way from Gilbert and Queen Creek.  I like the Vig McCormick ranch, same great food and cool atmosphere but still a bit of a drive.  I was so excited there was a Vig being built right in my neighborhood. I watched the construction progress on my way to and fro work. I told my friends who didn't know about the Vig how awesome it was and how excited I was to have one close. It was going to be my number one go to place.  I have been going to Local Bistro, Modern Sports Grill in DC ranch and Isabell's. Now there would e a Vig which is closer and better.  I went to the Vig and it was ok, I figured they had just opened and they were still hiring and getting organized.  I went  again. Food was great, bummer no band due to Scottsdale rules but DJ is nice. Service ok but its busy on a Friday. I went again, food great as always but service still lacking. I figured its just busy. At this point I had gone 4 Friday nights in a row. Its close great food and I have always loved the Vig.   I don't get why I have to wait so long to get a drink at the bar. I don't understand why once I get a drink, I'm not offered a refill or second round. I'm trying to unwind on a Friday night, I don't want to have to work to get the bartenders attention to get a drink.   Ok had my cocktails, now time for dinner. The food has always been great. Good taste, good variety on the menu, priced fair. Why does it take so long to put in my dinner order? If I have been there 5-7 times, I have had to wait to order too long maybe 5 times. The food comes out quickly enough and luckily its good since the wait staff doesn't check back.   My friends and coworkers know I go out to eat quite a bit. I am often asked for recommendations, I had said to go to the Vig but I feel I can't recommend it anymore. If anything I would say to go somewhere else. I fell like the McDowell Mountain Ranch location has been open long enough to be running smoothly but its not apparent in the bartenders and wait staff.    Please get better with your service. I want to love this Vig as much as the others but its getting hard.  I work hard for the money I spend at the Vig and don't like feeling unappreciated as a customer."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I am not drunk.  I am female.  Never again.  Disturbing.  Sunday night was more than I bargained for:  drunk women - not girls - at the bar, my cocktail was reminiscent of drinking rose hand soap, and the meal was something I could have made at home and better.  This is a Sunday night.  The poachers waiting for the Girl to be drunk enough to go in for the kill.  That was it.  Had to leave.  Never again.  Hope your experience is better."}
{"text":"Service was great even though it was busy. The food wonderful, the music was just a bit loud only because we were trying to have conversations in a larger group ."}
{"text":"Nice wine selection food is good but be ready for the wait. The wait can up to 45 mins. If that is the case then head over to the one on McCormick pkwy and Hayden."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice.  First time pleasant, food good, service great.  Second time, shrill screaming little girls, food good, service not good.  Both times for lunch.  Based on previous reviews, would not attempt dinner."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today. Had some awesome service and will definitely be back. Make sure you are seated in Abby's section- she was great. Had the Mac n cheese with chicken and a Scottsdale blonde. Atmosphere was good- check it out."}
{"text":"We came here for Mother's Day brunch and the service was great and although they don't take reservations they sat us pretty quickly. The food was great and the atmosphere was very friendly. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Obviously, by the crowd, this is THE PLACE to be! Super cool patio, one of the best I've seen. Amazing wrap around bar and great bar tenders who are eager to help get your drink order.  We had a larger party and the wait was long for them to accommodate us but they got it figured out.  Staff is very laid back and in no hurry but this is the place to stay, have drinks, food, listen to music and be merry.  The food and drinks were excellent. Get the wings! Grilled, and the sauce was perfect.  The grilled chicken BLT with spicy mayo was delicious!  This is a great place to chill with family and friends."}
{"text":"The wait is definitely challenging during peak times, but I love the vibe here, as well as the beer selection. I wish the live music wasn't so loud (maybe they could position the band in a corner rather than in the middle). Wow, I sound old lol. It was hard to chat with people over the music. My food was great and the prices seem fair for the area."}
{"text":"My family (8 of us) came here for my mothers birthday, which, of course is a BIG DEAL. I had heard so many good things about this place since it opened, and let me tell ya.... DIDNT DISAPPOINT. Andrew was our server and couldnt of given us better service. My brothers stole most of my chicken wings but thats okay because i stole most of my daughters mac n cheese, shes 6, she needed help anyway! My dad got pad thai, which he raved about and my brothers got tacos that can make your mouth water by just thinking of them!! The view was phenominal, the table we were sat at was all made out of beautiful wood and the atmosphere was devine. Also, kids LOVED all the space given to play cornhole. Thank you again Andrew for making my mothers birthday absolutely incredible, we will be back soon, and many many times after that!"}
{"text":"Great establishment. Great chef. Great food. Amazing drinks. Lots of entertainment. Always enjoyable!"}
{"text":"If I wanted to deal with a bunch of kids I would go to Chuckie Cheese. A great location wasted on a bunch of kids running around while their inconsiderate parents don't give a damn."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! I ordered the steak salad and my husband ordered the eggs Benedict and both were fantastic. The bartender is humorous and the whole experience has been great. We will definitely be back. I'm excited to have the Vig in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"After the stress of my finals had subsided, I joined some friends at the Vig for drinks! We had an incredible time, sat at the bar. I had the daily mule and then a margarita! The staff is also incredible, great personalities and willing to give their input on drink selection. We also enjoyed a flatbread which was excellent.  I can't wait to sit outside in the evening next time and enjoy their menu!"}
{"text":"I had the watermelon and pork belly today and could hardly cut the pork belly.  The fatty parts were gelatinous and inedible.  Thank goodness for the big chunks if watermelon and glass of water or I would have starved.  Very disappointed this visit."}
{"text":"March 2018:  we went here with a large group (7) and had to wait around 45 minutes ... not a problem, they have a good beer list.  Guiness was only $4 on St Pat's day.  The special dinner, corn beef was awesome!  The outside seating looked very nice ( we had a table inside ... kind of noisy).  Sort of a limited menu, but good food and great staff.  Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for lunch in both the guacamole and the fish tacos were fantastic. The service and the ambience were great too. If I am in the area and need lunch again I will definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"So today my friend brought me to this place and honestly I had a great experience!!! The environment was so relax staff was very friendly and attentive. I would give them 10'stars if I could! The food was amazing and the drinks were even better. In conclusion I would I recommend this place to everyone around the north scottsdale areas!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have a Vig close to home! The service is so fast and awesome. The food is delicious! You must try the kale and jalapeño cheese fondue, it's freaking good! It was so good o forgot to take a picture of it lol. The ambiance I fun and lively! The Vig franchise always has the best and nicely designed facilities! You must go if you are in the neighborhood! It's close to West World and worth hanging out at before or after the Phx Open, Barrette Jackson, or any other fun event!"}
{"text":"We popped in here with friends for my husband's birthday over the weekend and had a wonderful experience! They also had live music around brunch time and that was such a nice treat! This location is different from the others - extremely large, with modern, clean lines, gorgeous mountain views, and a wonderful outdoor space with lots of lounge furniture. It is a great place for large groups and for bringing kiddos!   To start, I tried their Bloody Mary and it was so amazing!!! I'm picky about my BMs and this one was spiced to perfection. The food menu is the same as other Vig locations so I ordered my favorite - Pad Thai with chicken. Yum!   All in all, it is a lovely addition to this neighborhood and really speaks to the younger folks (20s/30s) residing in the area! Much needed up here! We'll be back for sure as we have besties that live right around the corner."}
{"text":"This Vig is super nice and super new. Right on the corner of Bell and Thompson Peak Parkway. There is a Chase Bank and Bashas in this corner center. Honestly this shopping area and all inside it would have died if not for the Vig and the Foothills Animal Rescue coming.   The Vig has complimentary valentines, beautifully designed walkway entrance and large bar in the center of the restaurant with lots of booths and tables and then their outdoor space is really what to boast about. It's very welcoming and feels like you're a party in someone's backyard. Plenty of TVs cornhole fire pits etc"}
{"text":"Overpriced food and beverage. Inattentive staff and not family friendly despite being in a family oriented neighborhood.  Think they made a mistake opening in this locale. Probably better suited in a more urban environment."}
{"text":"We ate at this new Vig location on Father's Day. Though it was wildly crowded, we were able to sit at the bar, have a fantastic bloody Mary's that I made myself using their Bloody Mary bar. The Father's Day brunch menu was short, but we all tried something different with our family of four. It was fantastic! Bartender was funny and attentive. Ambience is better than the other location in McDowell Mountain Ranch."}
{"text":"Umm. Whoever doesn't like it here probably needs to come back and get Soto as their server. Like for reals. How can you not love amazing happy hour deals with great food and drinks WITH a spectacular view?!  Stopped by last night with my girls for happy hour, and snagged a great spot out on the patio (since it's finally getting cool). We had the pleasure of being served by the phenomenal Ms. Soto -- ask for her, she's the greatest! She brought us our drinks quickly. All of them are yummy! I opted for the Coug Cup, refreshing, light, and tart -- drool! And my girls got the Old-Fashioned and Bennett & Bubbles, both were good, however the Bubbles was a tad too sweet for my liking. We asked Soto what she recommends as far as food items, and she informed us that the Grilled Fish Tacos are amazing (try them, you won't regret it -- there's 4 per order), and the Flatbread (the chef's creation on this particular evening was a white flatbread: Alfredo sauce with grilled chicken along with cheese and yummy spices).   We were here more for the ambiance and catching up, but we couldn't have had a better evening. The food and drinks were scrumptious! Soto was the absolute greatest -- she's incredibly sweet, funny, attentive, and kind! Sam, the GM, even came by the table a few times -- (mainly 'cause we kept asking for him... hey, girls need some eye candy, hehe). And the other guests are great, too! It's like going to a huge neighborhood BBQ; everyone was chatting with each other, just having a great time and enjoying each other's company... which let's face it, in today's world, it's nice to see such great human interaction rather than everyone being glued to their phones.   I'm kinda bummed out that I don't live in McDowell Mountain anymore and won't be able to come here literally every night... I totally would, trust me. I think it's my new favorite happy hour spot, though. yay!"}
{"text":"I am super thrilled that we have The Vig closer to our home.  I have visited all of them in the past.  This one is going to be my favorite, not only because it is closer but also because the patio area is so beautiful.  The food is the same on all of them and they seem to be very consistent. I have had the steak salad and poke bowl as well as some happy hour menu items.  My son loves the sliders, he thinks they are the best in the world.  My daughter still has to find her signature dish.  She has tried the mac and cheese and the chicken tenders, those were a little too crusty, and hard so I kind of understand why she didn't eat them.  The cocktails are good.  My bubbles and bennet was a little weaker at this location, but I will be understanding of the newness and not nick them.  So excited to come here as much as possible"}
{"text":"We called ahead to confirm they could handle a party of 10 adults and 10 kids and were told yes.   The server was very nice and she busted her tail but the time it took to get drinks (22 minutes) and food (all came out at different times) took waaaay to long.   Really not a picky person or like to give poor reviews, but would never take a large group here again or even think of bringing kids...  Scale of 1-10 for great food: 2 (stay away from the short rib tacos...not good)"}
{"text":"Food was great! The service however is horrible!! Our waitress was near non existent... She only came by our table to apologize after we flagged down anyone we could see to take our order or give any form of service..we sat on the patio and she just seemed to not care.. basically moved like a snail...   Moral of the story... Service so bad it ruins the food...   #bringbackservice"}
{"text":"Say what?  Huh? I can't hear you!  I want to like this Vig, as much as I do the other Vig's, but...  But the noise decibels here make it nearly impossible to hear the person sitting next to you. The owners need to install some sound deafening material. If my wife wasn't sitting at my elbow, we would have walked out.  So a negative number of some kind for ambiance.  As for the food, we've been to several of their locations and we like it a lot. Absolutely Four Stars. The Brussel Sprouts are a must, as is the Mac 'n Cheese, see photos. Expect to pay around $25 each depending on how thirsty or hungry you are, or what big game is on one of their multiple HDTVs"}
{"text":"I've been to three Vig locations and really like their food and cocktails. I wouldn't give them 5 stars because I think their portions could be a little bigger for the prices. However, it's a consistently good place to go for Happy Hour or a late night snack. I usually get the Fish Tacos or Charcuturie Board and a Moscow Mule which does come in a copper mug.  The Vig in Arcadia is probably my favorite because the patio is really intimate and Holly Pyle and House of Stairs play there sometimes. That really makes a boring Wednesday night fun!   This Vig location also has a really nice patio but a totally different relaxed vibe.   One of the reasons I'm writing this review is because I saw this Vig location being criticized as \"not family friendly\" on another online forum. There seemed to be some fundamental misunderstanding that because there are a lot of families in the McDowell Mountain area that it \"should\" be a family restaurant. That is completely ridiculous!   This Vig location is just like the others, mostly a bar. And it was set up to accommodate adult guests that might be biking or hiking in the area as a place to relax and chill. I don't know why someone would think the fundamental nature of the restaurant would change because of the location. So just in case you're wondering...this is an upscale adult drinking and dining environment.   Pretty views, nice patio, nice architectural style...definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"We came here about a month ago on a Sunday.  It was my first time at the new location.  I love the set up.  Large long booths and tables, and the outside patio is a huge bonus!  So I've heard good things about the wings so I decided to try them.  I however did not like them.  They were extremely dry.  Then I got the Mac and cheese as always.  That never fails my expectations.   But this time I added the short rib to them which was delicious.  But I felt like it took away from the delicious Mac n cheese.  So next time I'll get the shirt rib on the side.  And last but not least you can never go wrong with half price bottles of wine.  Service was great and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sadly this restaurant went from being one of our favorite spots - where they had a bocce ball court and corn hole throw games where adults and kids felt equally welcome and could have a great time - to a spot that got rid of all the fun parts and replaced it with more seating.  We were told they received a lot of complaints about kids running around so now the kids are not allowed to roam through the grassy areas any longer even when no one is seated in those areas.  Too bad because the kids used to love the games in the grassy area."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio and great cocktails. Be prepared to wait - we had to literally flag down our server after being seated (20 minutes at the bar & another 20 waiting for someone to acknowledge us at our table).  Food was OK, bland with large portions.  Will come back to drink on the patio though."}
{"text":"Brunch We played Trivial Pursuit while sipping on coffees, orange juice, and a Bloody Mary. While adults have their own space, the little ones can run around in the grass area, and play bean bag toss.  All around friendly service and cleanliness. The folks I went with, said the Breakfast Sandwich on a croissant was the best Breakfast Sandwich they had ever had! I enjoyed American Breakfast- eggs over easy (were cooked over medium), bacon was perfect, toast was ok and potatoes were nothing to rave about. But I wish I would've gotten the breakfast sandwich with quality ingredients like fresh avocado and their subtle chipotle sauce.  I also sampled the french toast- recommended if you have a sweet tooth.  Oh, and some sweet potato fries that looked delicious went by to another table so maybe sample those."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable. Food portions were liberal and quality was top/tier. Great ambience at both the bar and regular dining areas. Lots of outdoor seating options as well. Will be Going back here..."}
{"text":"For each of our birthdays my office goes out for an extra long lunch. This time we chose the Vig because it was new, close to the office and most hadn't been there before. We made a reservation for the 8 of us, but when we got there, we were seated in a corner with 2 separate tables and corner bench seating. So we would be sitting in 2 separate groups, not acceptable. Went and asked for another table and was sat at a nice one large enough to accommodate all of us. It was, however,right under the air vent and it was freezing. We delt with it because we didn't have time to move and we must have gotten lucky because we had good service.   Kale artichoke dip was good with alot of chips for all of us to share. Calamari was also good and pretty tender. 2 people ordered the appetizer sliders for their lunch and were very pleased. There are three to an order and they were a good size with good flavor. 1 gal ordered a burger and thought it was delicious. The rest of us ordered the grilled fish tacos and were very disappointed. There were 4 tacos and each were completely overloaded with the slaw and pico de gallo and had a tiny piece of fish 1/2 the size of the taco in it (did someone forget to catch the fish that day,jeez)It was more like a slaw taco with a side of grilled fish. All of us dumped out 1/2 of the slaw of 2 tacos and added the fish from the remaining 2( which none of ate) it would be 100% better if there were only 3 tacos, less slaw and a piece of fish that actually filled each taco.   All in all, it was ok, but I don't think we will be back for lunch. Seems like a place to just come and have appetizers."}
{"text":"Wow! I had not been to any of The Vig locations, and i have been missing out. We had dinner here, and it was amazing! We had a party of six and got seated right away. The atmosphere is very intimate and easy to have conversation. The appetizers are incredible. I had a Mac and cheese entree, with chicken. The chicken was a bit plain, but that is small in comparison to everything else. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this New Vig! Excellent menu, food is super delish, atmosphere is on point, and the bartender Mark is the best! His speciality is the Sweet Piper made with Deep Eddy and it's our new fav."}
{"text":"Yes, its time to have your next after our office experience at The Vig, so it's difficult to arrange a large party event for multiple participants however a big did a fantastic job at having our food set up and our drinks ready and it made it easy and amazing I would definitely suggest this as a place to go for a group event or just after hours The Vig as top Stars congratulations to them by the way I didn't even mention the food the food is really great and the drinks are top notch"}
{"text":"I would like to give 0 stars. I came here for a 50th birthday for my best friend's mom, we were having a good time until another person in our group was cussed out by another man for the NCAA team she loved. She walked away, & then HE walked to us and began talking to us and sat down. Then, an older lady in his group began taking pictures on her camera of all of us. First, I HAD NOTHING to do with the issue they had, so I was VERY uncomfortable with her taking pictures of me that I did not authorize. I asked her to stop & to delete them because she had NO RIGHT to take pictures of me when I did NOTHING wrong. I spoke to the manager on duty, & he walked over & instead of asking to delete the pictures or even solve the problem, he was laughing with them obviously showing that he was friends with them. After that, never saw the manager again. Highly recommend not going here if you are not friends with any of the people that work there."}
{"text":"It's hard to care about anything other than the building. Its perfect! It doesn't hurt that the food and drinks are amazing too. If I had to pick, the service is what is lacking but who cares! The food, the drinks, and did I mention the building. My go-to favorite late night spot!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time yesterday! As always great food and service at the bar was good. Friend's had breakfast and I had Grilled fish tacos. Everything was delicious. Location is awesome! Beautiful views!!! We moved from inside to outside after a few drinks and couldn't get a server for awhile. Everyone seemed a little confused out there? great new neighborhood bar would be better if they added more tvs for football season. I will definitely be coming back till that starts up:)"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, nice urban decor and view! Plan to return for patio dining and games soon!  Steak salad is delicious!"}
{"text":"Since this place opened (I believe in July of 2017) I have been here no less than 8 times.  Why?  It's close to where I live.  That being said, My original review with the delicious cosmos is now null and void.  Every single time I go there, the drink is made differently.  The last time, embarrassingly, I sent it back, then the manager came to the table and asked how I would like my como made!  Really???  I actually had to explain to the manager how to make a cosmopolitan, then was up-charged for some unapparent reason.  Anyhow, still noisy inside, food marginal, no bartenders outside when you need one, but atmosphere outside is very pleasant this time of year.  Lastly, why do I go here again, it's close to where I live."}
{"text":"So....have only done lunch at the bar after a visit to The Village. Both times the service has been great, the food as well....what's not to like! This area needs more restaurants and this is a real gem!"}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite Vig location. Huge outdoor patio with lots of entertainment such as corn hole, croquet, band, etc. Lots of misters and fans so even in 100 degree heat sitting outside is comfortable! The location has a perfect view of Mcdowell mountain. Now to the inside of the restaurant, huge bar and lots of window so even when sitting inside it feels as though you're outside. Customer service was great, our server was extremely nice, he made a lot of recommendations which was very helpful because we wanted to order everything off the menu. We ordered the pork belly, steak & fries, wings, fried chicken sandwich and all 3 desserts... I don't regret a thing! The pork belly melted in your mouth, it was amazing. Steak was amazing, cooked perfectly and just as asked. Chicken sandwich was crispy goodness, lots of flavors but all tasted well together. Wings are always a hit at the Vig, some of the best in town in my opinion! Everything we ordered either met or exceeded all my expectations. I'd definitely pay a visit back to this location, although further from me than other locations this new Vig is absolutely beautiful!"}
{"text":"Awesome patio seating. I really enjoyed outside patio. But late night menu options were so limited. I will be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Best for younger crowd and families with children. Told wait was 15-20 min.  Was 45. Great bartender and nice server. Just tooooooo noisy and hectic for us.   Hard to have a relaxing evening here. High energy group. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, fish tacos, but the service was not.  I was welcomed in to find seats for drinks, only to be asked to move. Then server was not in yet to, cover our area, we were told, after we had been waiting. Then we were over crowded by table next to us, turned around to be served bill..and when I asked if they were trying to get rid of us-basically yes!!"}
{"text":"Visited the Vig a few times recently and enjoyed the outside patio. If you're going, I suggest going after 8 p.m. Otherwise you're left with dealing with the possibility of kids constantly running around. Great place to grab a drink and snacks with friends or significant other. Primary menu is ok but seems to lack cohesion as many of their options seem to be randomly selected. Not a place I'd recommend for dinner, but if you live in the area, have kids and/or are looking for a place to grab a drink and hang out, it's somewhere to consider. Likely to return at some point."}
{"text":"What can I say? I like the comfort of the patio in the downtown venue better than this location. The first thought that crossed my mind is where is the golf course? This place totally reminds me of a golf course club house; furniture and all.  The food and drink were awesome! As all of the Vig locations provide that great element. Access is super quick and easy off of the 101. The operation is beautiful and is a fantastic neighborhood. However, I like a place with a little more edge to it.  If I had my golf cleats on and those shorts with the built in goober belt, I may have felt more at home. It feels like a place for wanna be yuppy bikers to pretend their cool. You need to form you own opinions. Mine are just that. I'm sure it's a party when the patio is rocking and a ton-o-fun!  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate #Irishcatv2 #jimsboisset"}
{"text":"Ideally I would like to give this place 3.5 stars so that wasn't an option. After careful consideration I decided to bump them up to 4 stars.the ambience was very nice. My friends and I went to the Vig for a Sunday brunch date. I received a 20% off coupon so that was a bonus. ( thanks to the yelp gets spooked party)     Well, I ordered the Monte Cristo which was a egg sandwich on French toast! It was a stoners dream!  . It was really good the French toast was soft not super hard or crunchy. The eggs were cooked perfectly I'm not a fan of yolky eggs, so I was in heaven ! I also paired it with a mimosa ha who am I kidding I had multiple mimosa's .The mimosa's were a good  mix of OJ and champagne. One of my friends had a Bloody Mary and of course he had access to their Bloody Mary bar, I'm not a fan of bloody Mary's but he was over there for quiet a while. There was live music, so that was really nice it Created this LA vibe.  The reason why I wanted to give it 3.5 stars, the host attempted to sit us outside which is what we preferred but it was a couch. No one wants to have brunch on a couch. I told her we would sit at the bar and wait, well she forgot about us and 10mins later she sat a party of 3 outside. Well there went our table so we opted to sit at the bar. Well everything happens for a reason because we enjoyed a good breeze from the outside.  But overall this place was awesome, now I want to try one of the other locations!"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for what seems like forever for this place to open! The building took an extremely long time. We waited a few weeks after opening for them to work out the kinks. Seems we didn't wait long enough. Went on a Tuesday at 3pm for happy hour. Place was busy, but not too crowded. Sat at the bar & waited a bit to be offered a menu. Ordered a couple of drinks. ( Do NOT order anything with tonic, it's from the gun, & AWFUL!!) Bartenders seemed to be overwhelmed. Told the bartender the tonic was awful, his response was, \"sorry\". There were at least 5 servers ( one of whom almost ran into me with no apology ) & 2 bartenders (plus food runners). I've seen larger & busier places run efficiently with fewer staff. Another bartender came on after we were there for about 40 minutes. Had to ask twice for our bill. Had the sliders & fish tacos. They were ok, nothing to write home about. When the bill arrived, it wasn't itemized, I just hope it was right...I HATE that. The women's restroom is so dark, you might want to bring a flashlight. We were really hoping for a good local place to go to. We were soooo disappointed. Sorry, Vig; we will not be recommending you!"}
{"text":"Love this new spot! & close to home! The patio is huge with a lot of seating area. They have corn hole & Bocci ball. The clientele majority seem to be mostly late 40's & older. So we felt way young there. Our waitress was great. Very nice, prompt & friendly. We had the late night snack menu....sliders (with pretzel bun) & the Mac. It was good. I'll definitely be back. The ambiance is chill & casual"}
{"text":"Not at all impressed on a Saturday night. The promised 30 minute wait was actually 75 minutes (thank goodness for wine!).  And that was just the beginning.  Our dinner took another 45 minutes to get to the table and the appetizer arrived about 5 minutes before.  You would have expected the server (I won't call him out here, fortunately for him) to at least stop by and maybe just check on us or even apologize for the long delay, but he was MIA most of the night. Then to make a bad evening even worse, around 8pm the restaurant literally blasted music so loud (we were seated on the patio) I had to read the lips of the others at the table to understand their words. Don't get me wrong, I could have enjoyed the music if the decibel level wasn't at screaming. The food was ok, but nothing special. Do yourself a favor and pass this location by."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich + roasted brussel sprouts were delicious! My husband got the Pad Thai and agreed it was amazing. The mimosa & Bloody Mary bar is definitely something we will be back for! Great find!"}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere is beautiful, we had a surprisingly unremarkable brunch at the Vig McDowell Mountain. The chipotle eggs benedict was just OK. The chipotle hollandaise was bland even compared to a plain hollandaise. There was nothing \"tres leches\" about the very pedestrian French toast and the breakfast potatoes were, well, boring. I got a taste of my friend's pad Thai and that had a nice kick. I've enjoyed several visits to the Vig Uptown, but never for brunch. If we go to McDowell Mountain again, it will be in cooler temps to relax on the gorgeous patio. We'll take advantage of the $3 mimosas and $4 bloody bar, but we'll order lunch."}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars  - you come for the atmosphere, drinks and great environment at any of the Vigs IMO. So here's the Atmosphere part....Had to remove a star because it has become yet another place for parents to bring their toddlers so they can play while the parents drink. We went Saturday afternoon and half the patio was taken up for a 3 year olds party. NOT OK IMO. this is a BAR. The Vig's management should be more wary of their audience. Parties at bars should be for adults, not a huge group of toddlers. Parents - please be considerate to the rest of us who get babysitters so we can enjoy our time out, or, at the very least, control your kids. Restaurants are not playgrounds. I'm all for bringing the kids out to eat wherever you go (and I did) but kids racing around a restaurant(BAR!) - especially if you plan a whole party to take up half that restaurant (again, BAR!!!) is not OK. Put your need to drink on hold and go to one of the MANY more appropriate venues for kids parties."}
{"text":"\"Don't take reservation\"-yet 3 tables said reserved. Waited 1/2 hour and then they sat us at one of the same open tables.5:30 on a Friday. The 2 women ordered the house Pinot and the other a Chardonay. They ended up with $14 & $17 glasses of wine. Service was slow, no attention to us could not get water glasses filled etc. Finally spoke to the Manager, things got a little better but not much. The only thing they were very fast and good at was taking your plate away - they must of been running out. Not a place for dinner unless you like lunch food at dinner."}
{"text":"Stolled in for Brunch and mimosas. We arrived right as they opened. We live in the area and decided to give this location a try. Ordered the enchiladas de polo. Was very good but came with lots of lettuce on top which menu did not specify, for those who love southwest the tomatillo sauce is really good just order with no lettuce. Wifey ordered the breakfast sandwich which was larger than expected on an English Muffin. She liked it was well, but will order the muffin to be toasted longer. Really enjoyed the mimosas and the price!  While there competition on Sunday Funday is fierce in the area, we will be returning. Great experience and priced reasonable in the N. Scotts area."}
{"text":"First time her and was very impressed.  Warning! This place is busy, but worth it.  Really good food - must try the Pad Thai.  Service was great. They have live music as well, we will be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night. Once we were sat, it took at least 5 minutes for someone to greet us and bring us water. Another 5-10 minutes for a drink order to arrive. When dinner arrived, they brought 2 of the 3 dinners out and had us waiting on the last dinner for at least 7 minutes (which we had to ask for) w/ no silverware & empty glasses. I have patience,  as I've worked in the service industry- but I couldn't believe it. Great establishment, just needs to be properly staffed for busy times and for servers to not be rude."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the atmosphere of the Vig so I was excited when I first walked in! Unfortunately the food made me feel really sick afterwards so I had to dock stars ha. So we had to wait a couple minutes to be seated and it was crowded so service was a tad slow but not bad, we got our food really quick which was nice! I was debating between getting a black bean burger or Mac n cheese with broccoli added. I ended up getting the black bean burger with a side of sweet potato fries. My boyfriend got a burger too but I don't remember what it was called, and sweet potato fries. We both thought the fries were pretty tasty! The dipping sauce wasn't really our thing, but they gave me ketchup so I was happy! He black bean burger was kind of charred, it tasted ok and I liked the red bell pepper on it, but I felt so sick after eating it. I eat black bean burgers pretty regularly but something was definitely off about this one. My boyfriend said his burger was pretty good but not his fave. I saw a table nearby got Mac n cheese that looked really good, I'd be down to come back and try that but I'm a little nervous to return after my not so great black bean burger experience."}
{"text":"Fun spot came here on a Saturday night with my husband and 2 sons (21 and 18).  It was super busy...a great place to watch college football games for sure.  Lots of Tv's.   One son ordered pad thai and its was bland and nothing special the other son had the Vig burger and fries and ate the whole thing and rated it a 7 in his opinion....my husband had a burger he said it was delicious and gave it an 8.  I had the chicken sandwich and it was OK don't think I would order again - I would describe it as dry - needed some sauce on both buns. I also ordered the brussels sprouts and they were wet/mushy.    Overall great vibe!  The staff was friendly!  There was plenty of parking and even a valet service.   Outside dining area is large with lots of cozy sofas and a big grassy area (several children running around/screaming - seemed a bit odd ).  Lots of heating lamps and misters...A+ for this!!"}
{"text":"This location is the most recent new location of the Vig in the Phoenix/Scottsdale metroplex.  The restaurant is very well laid out with ample seating indoors as well as a sprawling outdoors.  This is a very family friendly restaurant and my 8 dining companions and I were amply impressed with the service and the food.  My pezole was perfect. What goodness in a soup: flavorful and hearty. Much as I loved it, the serving was so generous that I could not finish it.  My dining companions were equally satisfied with their selections.  We had a 2 year old and a 6 year old with us and they loved their kids meals.  I certainly intend to go back to try out their outdoor fun (it was just too hot to be sitting out).  I have eaten at the Vig McCormick (a sister establishment) and I can attest that this location is far more inviting than the Vig McCormick! In all fairness, this is new."}
{"text":"DON'T BRING YOUR KIDS HERE.   We tried The Vig McDowell Mountain for brunch last Sunday, and our experience was absolutely terrible.   1. We reserved an outdoor couch area because we were there with four kids under age five, and the first thing that happened is that the manager yelled at the kids for running in the grass area. They weren't climbing the rocks or rough-housing, just running back and forth. If the kids aren't allowed to run around in the grass while the parents look on and enjoy their drinks/food, what is the point of bringing kids here? We ended up having to sit our kids down on the couch with iPads so that they wouldn't run around.   2. It was a sunny 80+ degree day, but the heater at our area was on full blast. We asked the server and then the hostess if they could turn off the heat because it was unbearable The server said sure, but then disappeared and 15 minutes the heat was still on, so we tracked down the hostess and were told that the heaters couldn't be turned off because some of the guests on the shadier side of the patio would get cold. Apparently the heaters are either all on or all off, no matter the temperature.   3.  We were only able to order drinks and kids meals before our server disappeared and we didn't see him again for 30 minutes. By the time the kids had finished their food, the adults still hadn't had a chance to order entrees. I could tell our server was overwhelmed with tables, but it was still frustrating. Also didn't get a chips and guac appetizer we had ordered at the same time as the kids meals. My dad, who is more ornery than I am, asked for a table inside away from the heaters and with better service, to no avail.  4. The live music is just way too loud to be enjoyable at all. Impossible to hear what people at your table are saying, and honestly just not necessary. Who really needs live music at brunch?   By this point the kids were ready to go since they couldn't play and were done eating, so we ended up leaving without any adults getting to eat. We just picked up takeout on the way home.   We've been here before with and without kids, and had a good time on the instances without kids. Another reason not to take your kids here is that kids can't play unless an adult is standing there with them, so don't expect to enjoy your time on the patio while your kids play literally 10 feet away.     We'll probably be back because we do love the food and the set-up for adults only (when there is no live music), but never again for brunch and never again with kids."}
{"text":"Awesome place ! First time in and I could not have been happier. I am in the industry and was very impressed with the bartender Mark. He was very friendly, outgoing and attentive . Not only was he on top of our drinks and food he was so entertaining. Great time, great environment, and great food. Go see Mark at the outside bar Friday's and Saturday's !"}
{"text":"Came to the vig on Friday night. The place was packed, I found a spot at the bar and had the sliders and a few beers. The bartenders were funny and talking with me, lots of people watching. I was surprised people were on the patio with the heat, I didn't go out there but a lot of people were crowded around an outside bar. Fun place, will be back!!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was around when I lived in this part of town.  It's a brand new building built from the ground up just for The Vig.  I love the large rectangular bar.  It's a great place to sit and people-watch.  The food is pretty typical for The Vig - basically upscale bar food.  I always like the Trifecta sliders and fries for happy hour.  They have a great selection of craft beer, wine and liquors.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the place is WAY too LOUD. Went there with my wife on a Wednesday for dinner and it was nearly deafening. Had to practically scream the whole time. Nothing special was going on. Not sure if it's an architectural flaw in the design of the building or what but it was so loud we will likely not be back."}
{"text":"We had the perfect patio couch! The weather was perfect for Sunday fun day.  Our waiters were Assume! Cute, smart, attentive! The charcuterie board was delicious. The chutney was so tasty! .    Started with the Calamari which was delicious!  Love this place for our relaxing Sundays"}
{"text":"Luke and Breezy at the bar took great care of us!! By far the best bartenders we've ever experienced!! Atmosphere is pretty chill and fun during the weekends. Highly recommend when coming into eat, go to the bar!!"}
{"text":"The food is just ok.  However, the service is deplorable!  Our waitress is more concerned with flirting with her male customers than actually taking care of her other tables.  I've watched every other server in here be ultra attentive and run circles around her.  Not likely to visit here again anytime soon.  Management t doesn't seem to get it or even apologize even after we complained."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere ! Very trendy vibe, great food and drinks ! Very large and cool looking"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant, but we were quoted 40 minutes on a Wednesday night. We sat in the lawn area at some empty chairs and then were told this area wasn't available. Well, 2 minutes later a hostess came over and said we could sit there. IDK. Drinks ordered- check! Food ordered- check! More drinks ordered - no drinks no food. 2 plates delivered- where's the third? Where's the third, where's the drinks? Oops- plate three delivered- no silverware! Oooops, there's no clean silverware. Well all food is delivered with slow service and excuses."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona!  They have the best guacamole and it is a staple that I get every time I visit this location.  Their staff is great and they always look like they are having fun which is contagious.  The manager was very nice and took time out to stop and check in to see how everything was with my meal in this crazy busy place.  Keep it awesome and I will return!!"}
{"text":"Today we visited the Vig  it was the worst experience , I never felt so unwanted,  The bartender didn't even look at us or knowledge us, we sat there for 10 minutes before we asked can we get some service?  We have been here in the past and had good experiences, but today, both bartenders seemed to be friendly to everyone else except us."}
{"text":"Great ahi poke bowl! We ordered it without the lettuce and it was even more delicious! Way cool vibe too! Great service, great music! We have been here twice in one week!"}
{"text":"The Vig McDowell Mountain is a happening new restaurant in North Scottsdale. We love sitting at the bar so we met bartender Luke...what a great guy who made our experience so fun!!!  I had the Pad Thai.  When the Food Network was here recently they asked the chef to prepare this amazing dish. I've never had such incredible Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Stopped by to meet a friend at 5pm and there was a 45 min. wait for a table and no seats at the bar. Decided to go outside on the patio to wait for my table but decided there was no reason to go back inside. Lots of seating, misters, shade. Lovely! I was waited on promptly but it took awhile for my glass of wine to arrive. When my friend arrived, she ordered wine and we shared the BBQ chicken flatbread. While the crust was good, the chicken itself was tough and on the cold side. When the wine arrived, I remarked about what a large pour it was. Pleasantly surprised. But I overhead another server asking a customer if they wanted the 6oz. or 9oz. wine. We were never asked that. Sure enough, when the bill came, we were each charged for the 9 oz. When we brought it up to our server, he said, \"No problem, I'll fix that for you\" and he did. So............while I loved The Vig and will surely go back, be careful about upcharging and look at your bill before paying. FYI, I observed others being served other menu items and they all looked good."}
{"text":"Please Vig look at your reviews. We want you to succeed but the food is not good. Make it ok and make the service better and we will come and be happy. But the way it is now is unacceptable!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with large group, probably about 15 of us. We sat outside, which is a huge space! I have to say I think this is my favorite Vig! It's large and has a beautiful view! We got a whole bunch of apps and they were all great. I really enjoyed the spicy edamame. For my meal, I got the nachos, which are one of my favorite things on the menu. I asked for the carnitas but when my plate came, it had chicken instead.  It was really dry and overdone. I wasn't a fan, but I didn't want to waste food by sending it back."}
{"text":"To be honest, the food is a two-star at best, but the bar and atmosphere lift the Vig.  Hostess desk and bartenders are impressive at a five star level.  Broad, creative drinks offered and the bartenders are not only efficient but very much know their craft...and like to talk about it.  Waitstaff is unfortunately under trained.  There is a prevailing sense, even a year after opening at this location, that they are always in the weeds.  Shame on the managers/owners for putting the staff in a position where they must openly admit that they have not sampled the food from the other Vig restaurants nor shadowed there to bring continuity to this newest branch of a growing empire.  The food is repeatedly either blah or an outright fail.  American food that defines \"Ugly American.\"  The artichoke cheese appetizer served in a cast iron skillet lacks any seasoning until you take it upon yourself to add salt to every single bite.  The chips it comes with I swear would be better from a convenience store bag and simply just flavorless corn triangles.  The Vig Burger is a soggy mess.  The brioche bun soaks up so much juice from the toppings, meat and egg that it is nearly like a meaty French toast that was served right after dredging it in the egg batter.  The bun choice isn't wrong but in order to avert the soggy status it needs to be either deconstructed on the plate or toasted to make room for the swamp.  The fried chicken sandwich is flavorful and perhaps the one standout to order.  Sides are embarrassing.  The onion rings and fries all taste like standard frozen fare bought from Sisco distributors and amended not at all.  The soba noodles are just gross, tasting like fish...how?  Lastly, and I'm embarrassed to point this out, the kids chicken fingers are worse than Sonic.  They totally lack depth of flavor and what total idiot thought it was a good idea to serve kids in an American-style restaurant a dipping sauce based on curry?    Atmosphere:  Rocks!!! I can't wait until the temps again drop out of the 100's to come back just for drinks and some cornhole on the patio.  This is one of the most gorgeous patios in North Scottsdale.  I want so badly for the Vig to succeed here.  They likely will on name alone.  The location is perfect for me and this area is in desperate need of good food.  That doesn't mean the people are desperate though.  The Vig must change and improve the menu and service or it will die here.  These people in this area are accustomed to driving for what they want and won't settle in on the Vig unless the food can at least improve on a restaurant par.  To the tremendous credit of the manager, I paid my bill without comment and then he caught us heading out the door to generically ask, \"how was the food?\"  I gave him an \"mehh.\" And he immediately wanted to know why it wasn't great.  He listened attentively and genuinely appeared to be taking note.  Then, unsolicited, gave us gift cards to come back and simply enjoy the bar.  He didn't try to make excuses, nor overly promise a change was coming.  He simply acknowledged that he shared many of the concerns, others have said similar comments and that he and his team are committed to make the Vig a great destination.  For that, the Vig gained another star.    After more than a year, I can recommend the Vig for drinks and fun...just eat before you go."}
{"text":"A plus for this location is that it is open late (I think they serve a full menu until 10 PM then have a bar menu later). Service was great, and the atmosphere is fun. There is a large patio with games (think corn hole and other outdoor games like that) and several TVs.  The food wasn't exciting. I had the grilled chopped salad, which may not have been the best option-- It is probably a better idea to stick to bar food here. On the up side, the guacamole was good!   If the Vig had a more creative drink list, larger wine selection, and more vegetarian choices I would definitely consider coming back, especially because I think the patio would be a great spot to hang out and watch a game!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat, last minute on a Saturday night, we ended up at the Vig in Scottsdale. We were greeted with no wait, and immediately shown to our table on the expansive patio. Tyler, our server, was wonderful. Very polite and quick with requests and orders. I ordered the best turkey sandwich, which is the best sandwich I may have ever had in my entire life. I will definitely return. Atmosphere is warm and comfortable, and the food and drinks are great."}
{"text":"First of all, any wine bar should not serve red wine at 72 degrees, in what world dues that taste good. Had a great flat bread, once, but the change everyday and will not make one that people actually like to eat. Pork belly, goatt cheese and pickeled  purple onions, that's horrible, you can't even get one made with mozzarella and pepperoni, or anything unless it's a chef special. Chef, you need to be more open for options.  I wing be coming back."}
{"text":"I would rate this restaurant a 5 star but this chick kept coming around with an iPad standing by our table looking at us and punching stuff in her iPad.  Just weird.  Kinda pissed me off."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see that The Vig opened up in my neighborhood! The restaurant itself is laid out in a nice open concept and has a wonderful patio set up with corn hole, nice lounge chairs, and misters for those hot summer days.   When we arrived & found out happy hour had already started (at 11am!!) we were super excited. We started off with the nachos and while they were good, the chips were too thin and broke very easily as we were eating them. Also, there were items on the nachos that weren't stated on the menu. So look out in case you are allergic to some food items. The grilled fish tacos were very good as was the strawberry fields salads. Overall, the food was fantastic & we are super excited to go back!  The only issue I had was that the drinks were lackluster. They were all served in pint glasses with no \"pizazz.\" They should incorporate different glass types and use a little bit of imagination for their garnishments on the drinks to make them \"Instagram worthy\" and more exciting."}
{"text":"This place gets mediocre reviews on Yelp which is exactly what it deserves. The place is always packed because it's hip has a great outdoor space and good people watching. Unfortunately because it's so busy you will wait forever to get your meal and you will probably be disappointed with the food and the price they charge for it. To give you an example of their fish tacos are mediocre at best and I can go a number of other places to get a much better fish taco. If you want a drink and people watch them this is probably the right place for you especially if you are in the 30 to 50 age category.  I have been to the 40th Street location with similar experiences."}
{"text":"Love the Vig, in general.  Love the vibe at McDowell Mountain.  It's very cool... which speaking of \"cool,\" brings me to a rather large issue in my opinion.  The AC blows so hard & cold, my brunch was actually COLD in less than 1 minute after being served... seriously!!!   ... ugh... cold food... no thanks.  Maybe they can fix this???"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with AMAZING views. It was very crowded when I went on a Saturday so if you're looking for something quite I would recommend the vig in McCormick ranch. We ordered the nachos (AMAZING), the calamari (so-so), the meat and cheese plate (very good). Ther service wasn't great but that could be due to the fact they had a line out the door of people just waiting for a seat."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with my friend. We sat at the bar and ordered the blackened fish tacos and shared a side of black beans. Both entrees were DELICIOUS. The beans were spicy and were so tasty and the fish tacos tasted fresh and light. I ordered a Bloody Mary and our bartender made it spicy for me. It was definitely the best Bloody Mary I have ever tasted. Next time I'm in town I will most likely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by last night to check it out on their opening night and only had drinks (which are great!!). Place is nicer then expected. Things looked to be very well ran for opening day!  Very roomy and spacious with tons of seating as well. Easy to bring a family with kids.  You can def see that tons of money went into building this place and the scenery around is awesome. I've had food at other Vigs and I'm sure this one wont disappoint as I will def be a regular at this one!!"}
{"text":"I was watching this restaurant were under construction for awhile since I live nearby and now that it's open I was anxious to try their food.  Came here for lunch with my son and was disappointed with their food. I gave three stars for the service and two for the food.  I had bean burger with sweet potato fries, it was just plain. I asked for hot sauce and extra onion and still didn't kick the flavor, what's going on???  My son had grill cheese sandwich with potato fries and he only eat one peace of the sandwiches.  Oh well, sorry VIG we just weren't into it."}
{"text":"The food was 3-4 stars and the service was 1 star. We went at happy hour and got a got nice table, but our server literally took 20+ minutes to delivery our drinks?? We had a number of the happy hour specials, flatbread, fish tacos, guacamole, all good. But one of our party ordered a burger with no sauce and it came with extra sauce. Another time we asked for more bread and a pita showed up? Our waiter was clueless. The scene was something to watch. Not for us, but it was packed so alot of people must like this place. Maybe good for drinks but don't expect good service. If there is a next time we will sit at the bar and eliminate the waiter."}
{"text":"The food is consistently above average and the hostesses are always very friendly and seem to manage the volume well, but the servers and bartenders are a mixed bag. Some are a tad rude but others are awesome. If you haven't been, give it a chance!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants in North Scottsdale. The ambiance alone is enough to give it 5 starts. The food and drinks were outstanding and the service was on point. I really look forward to my next visit. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Had a great time at the New Vig on Bell Road near McDowell Mountain.  The weather was perfect for lunch and cocktails on the patio. The service was great. They have happy hour 3-6 so we ordered $6 cocktails and $4 drafts.  We had the black & blue burger, Kale & Quinoa Salad, Fish Tacos and Short rib sandwich.  Everything was delicious!  I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For a local place we really like it the Burgers and Fries Are outstanding  the air conditioner is too cold but we keep coming back"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, slow inattentive service, okay food and prices.   We had... Charcuterie plate Greek chicken salad  Asian chop salad  Fish tacos  Unfortunately, nothing stood out. I'd say this is a good place for happy hour but not a full meal."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for the first time last week on a Thursday evening. It was busy and we could see why. The food was delicious. I tried the black bean burger and it was tasty. The patty was moist and the toppings were dressed/seasoned well. Someone in our party had the steak salad and enjoyed it. They had a talented musician providing live music. As other reviewers have stated, it is a bit loud so conversation was a little effort, but it was still a good experience. Our server was attentive and apologetic about a misunderstanding (he heard medium rare for the steak salad instead of medium well) and handled the situation well."}
{"text":"Great service, food and atmosphere. One of the most comfortable and well designed restaurants I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Use valet parking otherwise it's a haul from the back 40.  Good for the loud party crowd....altercation outside, dropped glasses by patrons...not-so-good for friends to gather for conversation and a dining experience. Our group had a 45m wait on a Fri eve.  Most of the lovely outdoor space was reserved for an after-party.  $70 for one round of pre-dinner cocktails.  We were seated inside at a booth along the front wall, next to the bar.  We had to forget about having any sort of  conversation.  The food was ok.  Service lacking warmth."}
{"text":"Thanks to all of those who mentioned the fish tacos in their reviews. I was way happier with the fish tacos than the sliders I had last time I was here. The happy hour fish tacos were yummy and a  generous portion. I enjoyed the happy hour mule cocktail also. Thanks to Amy Z for reminding me to sign up for Yelp cash back. I received a portion of my bill back to my credit card through it. Staff remained upbeat and attentive during an obviously busy time"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Atmosphere is great! My favorite Vig location that We have been. Large patio and outdoor area. Lots of space for games or enjoying the weather. The singers they get are AMAZING! Wings are delicious! One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary bar was great fun, and we had such a nice bartender. She was friendly and knowledgable on the menu!"}
{"text":"Very happy with this place, great location and outdoor area. The chicken sandwich and burger are my top regular orders."}
{"text":"Lunch today was great ... we arrived at 1130 and were seated in a comfortable booth.  The mango flavored ice t with orange slice was delightful and refilled 5 times during lunch .... attentive wait staff!   I had the chicken BLT on a ciabatta roll.  The chicken was tender and juicy, bacon crispy and the sauce spicy.   Great sandwich but would be better with a toasted bun or bread I think and crispy lettuce.   My guest ordered the wings and ate them all while making yummy sounds so I think they were great!   All in all a nice experience!  Oh and the architecture is Frank Lloyd Wright ish and really COOL."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice.  Both times with friends who wanted to try it.  Probably won't be going back.  The food is just ok but a bit over priced.  I had the Pad Thai and while the spiciness was just right the ingredients in the dish were lacking.  It looked like it came out of a can.  The atmosphere is nice although a little noisy so it is hard to have a conversation.  The parking is not good at all.  There are only 12 parking spaces in front of the restaurant.  There is parking across the parkway but be careful of cars coming off of Bell.  Also the sign on the building is very hard to see.  It is the same color as the building so it doesn't stand out at all.  Hopefully there is back lighting at night."}
{"text":"Overall I enjoyed it - I guess I just had different expectations . We sat outside and it was cool from the misters - even with the heat . Within the 10-15 minutes we waited for someone to take out order someone finally came with water . Awesome ! The server arrived and apologized because she just got there . So - I guess the greeters/hostesses sat us at a table with no server ...cool ! I don't blame the server at all - over the course of the meal she came by several times . She was cool . We weren't really in a rush but just let us know that we won't have a server for a while . It's frustrating seeing 5-6 employees walk by you with this look like \"I wonder who's got that table\" . I'd even go and get water myself.   We ordered green drinks - hint of almond and lime with a sprig of mint . Good .   Ordered artichoke,kale,jalepeno dip . Eh , ok . Not much on flavor . Served with tortilla chips and four pieces of pita . Ordered Charcuterie board -basic with no nuts like described .   I gave 3 stars for the outside ambiance . It's a great hang . I wouldn't go back for the food , but to hang and have a few drinks - sure . Bocci ball area is  outside - looks like a lot of thought was put into the décor and they slagged off on the menu . I'll go back and give it another try - next time for a dinner . Hope it's better ."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere was Amazing. Also our bartender who was outside who was taken care of our companies Happy Hour was Super friendly. She made sure we never left hanging. Sarah you Rock! Make sure to see her when you visit the Vig!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent  meal. Daughter had the burger and she really enjoyed it. My wife had avocado toast and that satisfies her healthy as well as taste cravings. I enjoyed the poke bowl. I would like to see a touch more fish in it but really good flavors. Service was great  cost was on par but a little more than I anticipated for lunch time."}
{"text":"The food was terrible. The service was sub par, waited 45 min for a table told 20 minutes. Showed up at 5 o'clock for happy hour by the time we were seated and able to order happy hour was over at six. Could not order anything off the happy hour menu. The bar was packed if you want to experience the happy hour you better show up at 4 o'clock to even think about participating. Love the Arcadia location was so wanting to love this place big fail!  Update Yelp friends notice  management never took the time to respond ! Take the few extra minutes and go to Kierland area!!"}
{"text":"Bought a new place right around the corner so we decided to try it for lunch...omg great food. The service was excellent and people were super nice. The bathrooms were very clean and smelled of bleach. The vibe and decor are great. This will be our new regular lunch or happy hour spot we can ride bikes to or just walk to."}
{"text":"I am hoping future visits will raise my expectations of our new neighborhood restaurant with a Beautiful view. I came in with friends on opening day,  the background music was so  loud and with the open floorplan we could not even hear each other. It was nice very relaxing. I am sure I will be back. Not so sure my friends will be as they came a long ways to visit..Until next time..."}
{"text":"Meh food, remarkably poor service. I was a little surprised to see how abrupt and inconsiderate the staff was to a family with kids. After witnessing that in what I'd consider a family neighborhood I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, except very noisy, especially inside and even in the bathrooms. Food is wonderful and service is good when it is not too busy."}
{"text":"Where do I start...  I've been meaning to write this review for a while but never had the time to.   My friends always posted pictures of this place on their instagrams, and were constantly dining at the Vig. So, I thought might as well try this place out and see what the rave is about. I arrived on a Wednesday afternoon with a friend of mine and was seated right away outside. It was pretty chilly out so I asked my waitress to turn on the individual heat lamps. She turned them on, I thanked her. No problem. I ordered a burger and left satisfied. Pretty good experience.   Why did I rate this place 2 stars?   I came yet again to The Vig for lunch with a friend and my mom on a Friday. We ordered fish tacos, sliders, guac & chips, etc. Again, it was chilly outside so I asked our waitress to turn the heat lamp on. She said ok, proceeded to leave our table and didn't come back until 20 minutes later. I was a bit confused because my waitress from my previous visit reached over our table to turn the lamp on, so I assumed the heat didn't need to be turned on by the inside. Anyways, not a big problem. I'll just ask her again when she comes back. She comes back 20 minutes later (we had to flag her down) and took our orders, again I mentioned the lamp. She then gave us attitude, saying that if she turns our INDIVIDUAL lamp on, then all the other lamps at the other tables would turn on, and the customers would complain. Right.. ok. As silly as it sounds over me complaining over a lamp, it was cold AF outside and my mom is elderly. It was a small problem and I didn't want to raise attention to our table so I just let it be. Now, the food. My tacos were pretty good and no one complained, but the sliders were tough and uneatable. That's all I have to say about that. After our waitress handed us the food, I literally never saw her until the end of our meal. She handed us the check and left. It was a big bill, but The Vig is not a fast food restaurant. She took the bill, and left. At this point we'd already spent a good 2-3 hours here and had other errands to run. I couldn't find her to get my change back so I went to the front desk to ask about my bill. They were apologetic and called over the manager. Got my change back, and left. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Julia the host is so rude. Unfortunately I've never even had the chance to try this place because I've been lied to twice. Called in advance both times and was told 20min wait time. Got there and was told an hour-an hour and a half?  Really because I just called like 10 minutes ago. Julia then proceeded to say she could fit us in within 30 min, and some other girl host (long dirty blonde hair) said \"sorry no you'll have to wait an hour and half\". How do you go from 20 min, to an hour, back to 30 min and back to an hour and a half??? At this point I said to Julia \"this is the second time this has happend to us\" her response \"maybe if you guys would come when the Phoenix open wasn't happening this wouldn't happen\" first of all RUDE response. Second of all, the first time this happened was a month ago, long before the open. And then right before we were about to just leave, she was like \"are you guys 21 because you have to be 21 to eat here anyway.\" Definitely over 21 by quite a few years. I would suggest to management to get your hosts some decent customer service skills and knowledge. They're the first person the customer sees and the last. And she was lacking many many skills, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm thinking about the Vig Chelada right now for Brunch at the Vig.  Pair that with the HangOver Helper and it's the perfect slow start to what became a bit of a late night more than I planned for thing.  So picture Carnitas, cheese, tortillas salsa eggs all layered really well and nice and hot and not a small portion either all in a sizzling hot pan served up to you.  That's my dream today.  I will add a picture later!  It's a nice atmosphere and if there is a game on even better."}
{"text":"We were so excited that the Vig opened in our neighborhood but the service was so bad & disappointing that we actually walked out after being ignored by the bar tender who was too busy flirting with young chicks (we had to ask for water twice, then had to tell him we were ready to order when he continued to ignore us).  When he realized we weren't happy being ignored, he rudely took our order.  After that we waited, waited and waited for our food.  Then a guy seated next to us who came & ordered after us got his food first.  That was it, we walked out & will not be coming back. Train your young staff to respect & provide good service to older patrons or we'll take our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in this part of town.  I like the design of the place - kind-of modern, Frank Lloyd Wrightish outside, upscale cool contemporary inside.  On busy nights this is the place to be around here, so plan on using their valet.  Great food menu and execution - especially for bar food - great drinks, and service that sincerely cares about what you want and if you're happy.  This Vig for sure is as good as it gets so deserves 5 stars in this neighborhood, because in comparison to other places nearby The Vig's atmosphere, food and service is so superior.  I'd be lying if I didn't tell you about some negatives, like how many children and babies come along with their drinking parents, how slow the service can be sometimes and how the food is always at least good but only sometimes fantastic.  Tip:  In the winter it's actually warmer on the patio than inside.  That's because they leave the doors open pretty much all the time so the inside doesn't feel heated, yet there are plenty of heaters on the patio."}
{"text":"It's a pretty spot located at the base of mountains in North Scottsdale. They have a limited selection of beer but their menu is pretty solid. Lots of old people and people with children. I get it people want a place to spend all their loot but when it starts looking like the geriatric ward meets the day-care center, then I'd say you've officially become an old-head/family oriented location. Which isn't bad if that's the vibe you are going for. The staff is very friendly and professional with everything pretty clean to include the bathrooms. Not a bad place to spend some $$."}
{"text":"I have to go to The Vig every time I'm in town. LOVE the ambiance and relaxed atmosphere. Excellent service and good food always.  Sunday brunch there is fabulous. They take good care of you"}
{"text":"We've been to The Vig plenty of times but this location has now made it not kid friendly.  They have an expansive patio with greenery and signs all over stating rules: no running, no screaming, no throwing, no gymnastics, no climbing, no no no etc. I forgot to take a picture of the sign. We were one of the first tables outside and it took over 40 minutes to get our food. Our coffee was lukewarm when it was brought out. We had to hunt down our server to ask him what was going on. The food was brought out, finally, with no apology, and it was cold. We talked to the hostesses on the way out and then a insincere apology was made. This restaurant is in a family neighborhood and it should be family friendly. I'm very disappointed. I gave it 2 stars for the beautiful patio and ok tasting food. The serve said \"I'm sorry\" while he handed back it card but there was no reason behind it."}
{"text":"No complaints! Awesome setting, attentive servers, and nice portions+fresh ingredients! You will enjoy yourself! Couldn't find HH menu online, so shown here."}
{"text":"Happy to see The Vig a little closer to home. Came here to meet my wife and her friend for a cocktail. Great people watching, awesome selection of beverages and their happy hour is worth the visit. Their tacos are BOMB. Get the tacos! Blackened whitefish, spicy slaw, pico de gallo, tomatillo-avocado salsa, yup they are that good!  Awesome selection of drinks on their happy hour too!   Again, awesome establishment and people watching!"}
{"text":"Great experience overall - they just opened but you would hardly know it - everything went smoothly, food was excellent, drinks are really creative, service was on target.  I think the best part was the atmosphere overall - the building is beautiful inside and the backyard area is pretty unique (backyard games with a view of the mountains).  Our group ordered the Pad Thai and the Asian Chop Salad - both worthy of a return visit.  If you really want to know, we also drank the Peach Shandy and Ramblin Rose - I probably could have had 6 of them as long as someone could drive me home.  This place literally opened 2 days ago and it already feels like it's been up and running for months - I plan to be back here often."}
{"text":"The food is really delicious! We got the nacho with chicken, short ribs taco, Mac and cheese with chicken and the salmon with soba noodles. Good atmosphere and the service was really good. We came on a Friday night it was pretty busy but not too bad, about an hour wait for a table of 4. Definitely recommend checking this place out and eating some of their yummy food! Keep it up."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Friday afternoon hangout, and by far my favorite of all the Vig locations.  Service is always friendly and fast.  The have great wine, beer and cocktail selections.  I love my Coug Cups!!  Vig has some of the best wings I've ever had, but all of their food is great so be sure to explore.  The atmosphere at this location is wonderful, with a huge multi-level patio and spaces for playing cornhole and bocce ball.  You can never go wrong with the Vig!!"}
{"text":"The property is beautiful. The staff was friendly. Yes there was a wait, but that's no issue! The location, atmosphere, and staff are what kept this from a 1/5 stars.  The biggest and only issue (it is a restaurant/bar) were that the food and drinks were horrendous. What I and my party ordered: Mojito : tasted like soda water with a bit of mint.  Pineapple rum drink : tasted like straight pineapple juice with water Nachos : tasted like Taco Bell's taco pizza Mac n cheese : tasted like the stuff from the box, with some raw broccoli and chicken cut up on top Bleu cheese burger w/ fries : these were so dry and flavorless, I had to ask for an aioli to be able to swallow the burger without choking. Didn't recognize any flavor of blue cheese, which is supposed to be strong and sharp. The fries had no salt, and were hard as rocks.   This is the definition of a tourist trap, and I won't fall for that again."}
{"text":"We went there for SNFD (Sunday Night Family Dinner) because my Wife had a $50 gift certificate. The place is nice but the food is mediocre.  The Calamari tasted like it just went from the freezer bag to the fryer.  Lumped together.  The Teriyaki chicken sandwich was Blah. and my Wife's fries were cold.  Service was ok, nothing to rave about but the kicker was when they refused to honor the gift certificate.  Will never be back regardless of the GC.  Easy to find much better places in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and perfect for the location. I have lived in DC Ranch for over 4 years now and have been wanting a restaurant/bar like the Vig for quite sometime. Food is pretty good and the service is awesome. They're always super packed and it doesn't faze the service. The best service that we had there was the bartender outside, Mark. Great job all around."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Beautiful outdoor seating. The service was excellent. I had the fish tacos.. great choice. Definitely going to frequent this awesome new spot. So excited this opened on our side of town."}
{"text":"We were really excited for the Vig coming. That was the end of it. THE WORST SERVICE WE HAVE EVER HAD EVER. The food was horrible what a waste of our time and money. We took 4 other people and everyone thought it was disgusting. The calamari was greasy and the list goes on and on. The drinks are weak and watered down. If you are going to bother to build a nice building you might want to hire people that know what they are doing that work there. All we can do at this point is pray this place closes quick and real restaurant buys the building. Do not bring crappy service and food to our neighborhood, what a joke. THE SERVICE IS THE WORST."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon.  At about 12:30 we waited 15 minutes.  The guy playing a guitar was really good.  The food was ok.  I enjoyed the fish tacos. Too bad the service was so bad.  I thought I was going to have to dig my own well to get more water.  I actually had to get up to ask the waitress for some water after she passed our table without looking at us.  Then she copped an attitude after that.  I did save money on alcohol since she never asked if I wanted a refill of my adult beverage.  I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday with several friends. Great staff, food, and terrific ambience with great views. The outside is fabulous and will be nice in the cooler months.  But yesterday everyone was inside and probably 75% full. We all immediately commented on how horrible the acoustics we're.  It's impossible to have a conversation inside. Can't imagine what it's like when it's crowded at happy hour or dinner?  Our terrific waitress smiled, agreed, and said \"yes, theres an issue and pointed to the hardwood ceilings\"."}
{"text":"We walked in and got sat. It took 10 minutes to get any service. Drinks were terrible and watered down. The server couldn't even hear our order. It was so loud my boyfriend couldn't hear a word. The beer was good! The black been burger was dry and bland as well as the mac and cheese. I had to ask 3 servers for ketchup. No one asked us how our food was. I am writing this as I sit here still waiting for the check which we asked for 20 minutes ago and still have yet to receive. The Vig downtown is amazing. I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a really neat place. I've gone to a few different locations and this is now one of my favorites! The ambience is really neat and the decor is very urban. I came here with my family to grab some drinks and appetizers, and our expectations were definitely met. The service was superb and the food and drinks were great! They also have a beautiful patio that you can hangout and play games like corn hole. I would recommend going here with friends for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour last week. We have been here multiple times and one of the best things I loved about this place was the grassy area where kids can play. As soon as we were seated outside, kids began to run and play. The manager immediately came outside with board games for the kids - apparently there were multiple complaints from other patrons with respect to kids running around. Okay we will respect the new rules.   Then food was served - although good, we were constantly trying to keep the flies from landing on our plates. It was really disgusting, and the first time I've seen that happen - wait staff indicated it had to do with these two weeks of the summer. Ok.  Kids could not sit still and the games were not fun for them - they loved this place because they could play, do cartwheels, etc. And coincidently the place was dead - it's always been busy in the previous times I've been here, even on a weekday.  Unfortunately we won't be coming back with kids in tow, and will request to sit inside to avoid the flies."}
{"text":"One of our favorite bartender/server who used to manage our choice sushi restaurant started working here a few weeks ago, so we decided to go visit her and check it out. I have to say, we are very glad that we did. The open concept of the restaurant with the turf outside and beautiful view is genius, I only wish the acoustics were better, it does get quite loud. The food was incredible as well. We had the soy edamame (upon lexi's recommendation) and it was brilliantly flavored. We also had the turkey sandwich, which was also incredible. We finished with the chocolate cake which was rich and amazing. We also had a couple of their specialty cocktails, and it may just be that Lexi is an amazing bartender (the best we've ever known), but they were refreshing and delicious. We are so glad that we decided to come check it out, it is definitely our new favorite spot. When you go, ask for Lexi, she makes the experience that much better. Overall, an amazing experience, we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've always loved the Vig. Been going to the McCormick location before this one opened. I recommend the Pozole, sliders Thai Chili chicken wings and of course, the Mac and cheese. I also love that they have Hoegaarden on tap. The patio at this location is insane compete with corn hole, an outdoor bar and on the weekends - live music!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place with great atmosphere and food? Then definitely come here. Patio is amazing with great views. Fun place to hang out with family and friends."}
{"text":"We waited a few months after this new location opened. This is a beautiful building in a beautiful location. I called a few days ahead for reservations, but was told they only take them for parties of 8 and larger. Went there at 5:30 pm on Saturday night and found a 45 min. wait for the patio. We got a drink and watched people. The place was packed!  As everyone has written, the inside area was extremely loud. Maybe the management can get a sound deadening company in there, as everyone is saying the same complaint on yelp. On the other hand, people are waiting in line to get in, noise or no noise. 3 people in our group ate cheese burgers. All were very happy with the size of the beef patty, the bun was very nice, the sides were hot. Our hostess tipped over my friend s beer, on our table, as soon as she seated us. That was a rough start! They did the right thing and bought him a new beer. We didn't stay for dessert because of the noise. We went down the street for gelato's, so we could talk normally. Food was good, building is beautiful, parking is easy, 45 min. wait is what it is. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"Even though they were in their first \"live\" week food and service were exceptional!  Love having a great new neighborhood go to!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love trying new restaurants, and were so disappointed here. The atmosphere is cool and fun but the service is horrible, the food wasn't good, and drinks tasted like they were mixed by undergrad college students who don't know what they're doing. Our waitress was terrible, my boyfriend's side never came (even though we asked multiple times) and I had to keep sending back my Daily Mule because it was disgusting (I LOVE mules and this was so gross). I usually never post negative reviews of a place on Yelp, but just want to let everyone else know so they can save their money, time, commute, and go eat somewhere better"}
{"text":"Overpriced bar food in a beautiful, lively atmosphere.  I really wanted to like this place as the architecture is beautiful, it is in a stunning location near the McDowell Mountains, and the vibe is fun. But the food was greasy and just sat like a ton of bricks. We had the calamari and short rib tacos."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks for happy hour, beautiful location.  I was most impressed with how well they handled the enormous crowd!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, drinks only but the food smelled amazing!! Was to crowded to find a place to sit but it does not disappoint! Love the set up!!! They did a great job with all the natural lighting and open concept. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened a Vig in my hood. The service is phenomenal. The location  is big and open with great views, both inside and out if you know what I mean. Head over with some friends and ask for Soto as your server. By the way Poke bowl is really good in the summer when watching your weight."}
{"text":"I walked into The Vig with relatively high expectations which had been built up by many Friends who had visited other branches. I was not necessary let down but just treated to an average night. I would not recommend this place if you want to have an nice conversation with someone, it is very hard to communicate hear unless your screaming. The food was ok the service was pretty good but the atmosphere lacked."}
{"text":"So happy they opened up right up the street from my house. Have been going to the original Vig on 39th Street since they first opened. And have gone to many of their other spots. So obviously very excited to hit their new spot which they built from the ground up with an incredible patio bar seating staff and food. Definitely need to check out their new spot if you've never been to The Vig before. Excellent happy hour from 3 to 6 p.m. and always have fresh new drinks to try and taste. Excellent friendly staff that is there to help serve and suggest. Come by and check it out for yourself. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love to eat dinner @ The Vig McDowell Mt with our son when we visit Scottsdale! Awesome outdoor dining and we love our fantastic waitress Jessie. I had the yummy Mac & Cheese (the best I have ever eaten), my husband had the sliders & onion rings & our son had the fish tacos.  Everything was great! What a wonderful job on the design and great staff. Looking forward to coming back on our next trip to AZ!"}
{"text":"Pros - - Great location and close to our house. - Great outdoor space. - Great edamame. - Very friendly staff.  Cons - - No more games like cornhole or bocce ball.  - Lot's of young children allowed to run all over the patio. Starts to feel like a playground.  - Waited 20 minutes for hot sauce after the food was served."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Arizona because the taste is great and the macaroni and cheese are outstanding"}
{"text":"People in the suburbs like to have fun, too! I'm thrilled this place opened in North Scottsdale. Their outdoor space with corn hole & cushy couches is fab. Not only is this spot great for families but also a hip place for happy hour with friends or date night.  Best thing on the menu is the steak salad. My husband raves about the Pad Thai too. Happy hour selection is pretty good with fish tacos, flatbreads & more."}
{"text":"We tried the new Vig for brunch on a Saturday.  Very nice, new building.  Large, rectangular bar with seating around it.  Lots of windows and a huge wrap-around patio with plenty of seating and a grassy area with games.  We sat at the bar and got good service.  I ordered eggs benedict - eggs were good but potatoes were cold.  My boyfriend got the traditional, american breakfast with scrambled eggs, toast, and hash browns.  Hash browns were cold and toast was stale.  The manager was pro-active, addressed the issue immediately and my boyfriend ordered a turkey sandwich with fries that was AMAZING.  $3 mimosas were tasty and NOT pre-mixed, which is great if you like \"just a whisper\" of OJ.  Now, we were told by the bartender that this place gets PACKED and that if you want to sit at the bar during the week for happy hour, you need to get here by 3:15 or it's not going to happen.  Also, it wasn't even half full when we were there and it was super loud and difficult to hear the bartender talk."}
{"text":"Very excited for this place to open since there are only a couple of decent restaurants in this immediate area and the Vig is very close to my house.  I tried it on a Friday evening, with a teenager, so that was probably a mistake. I then gave it a second chance on a Sunday late afternoon. After the second visit, I'm very disappointed to say I won't be going back. . On both occasions the staff was mostly friendly, but the service was slow and pretty inattentive -- and I'm not one who likes to be fawned over by wait staff unless I'm paying for that kind of service.  The space is really cool.  Very aesthetically pleasing.  Lots of indoor and outdoor seating that kind of merges together when the doors are opened because the \"doors\" are giant glass panels.  Lots of tv's if you're into sports.  The menu is meh.  Not big. Not fancy. But pretty diverse for its small size.  Easy to find at least a couple of things that will appeal to you. The food I've tried is just barely ok though.  I can't comment on the mixed drinks, but the wine menu also is not huge, but diverse enough in selection and price point that you'll find something.  Actually, the wine was probably the best thing about the experience on both occasions.  Omg, the NOISE. These reviews are not kidding when they say it's ridiculous.  You truly cannot carry on a conversation inside....at.all.  Plus, the indoor seating is all around the bar. So you have the added noise from the TV's and from the people at the bar yelling to hear each other.  It's so loud it's almost comical. Too hot to sit outside so far.  But it HAS to be better out there once the weather cools off.  And finally, the \"scene.\"  Lots of very wasted, very loud, middle-agey Scottsdale peeps making themselves right at home. On my second visit, a woman passed out sitting at the bar.  She was arched backward over her seat with her face to the ceiling and had to be helped out by the staff.  I honestly don't think I've ever seen anything like that before, especially at 4 in the afternoon -- and I've been to college lol. Not cool for kids whatsoever either time I've been there.   So, if you want to drink in a pretty cool looking environment with lots of tv's and a really nice outdoor area...and you don't mind screaming at your friends to be heard, this is the place for you.  Otherwise, unfortunately, no bueno."}
{"text":"We met some friends there for dinner last night. Great place and awesome location! It's huge - I think it might be their best location yet. Definitely will go back again to explore additional things on their menu."}
