{"text":"Food is okay- problem is they need some adult supervision in there . I think they are understaffed or the staff they have need better guidance - had to ask for silverware (none in container on table) had to ask for more coffee , wait time after ordering extraordinarily long-food was cold."}
{"text":"- Service was great. 
- Food was not as expected. Flaps were too dry and not enough sauce.
- I should have tried the waffles but instead went for flaps."}
{"text":"Whenever I come here I try to order something different, but that damn Bánh Mì seems to end up in front of me every time. Also, the PORK BELLY (not bacon) is amazing. 
Most definitely my favorite breakfast spot in CLE. 
I just wish they served alcohol, as a mimosa would compliment many of their dishes quite well. :("}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way, the food was killer- Vietnamese sausage and kimchi sandwich and I had pancakes. You will want to eat these things.

But the real draw is the LindsayToriCrystal. No it is not Italian glassware , they are three of the servers. it's like the Three Stooges meets the Marx Brothers meets Beavis and Butthead meets Adventure Time. I laughed I cried I ate sausage and pancakes."}
{"text":"Food allergies welcome! I am so happy when I don't have to be a second class citizen. Life as it's supposed to be! A must try."}
{"text":"Before I eat anywhere, I look up the menu. I do this so I don't end up whining online about the \"sweetness\" of a menu. Which wasn't even that sweet. 

This place is super hip inside & while tiny, we waited less than ten minutes. There were seven people ahead of us. Not bad for a Sunday. 

I ordered the red velvet waffle -- which I expected would be sweet. But I thought it was perfectly balanced & decadent. Exactly what red velvet is. The coffee was delicious & my cup was never even half empty. The vegetable root hash was beyond delicious. 

The service was great. The owner took our drink order instantly, our waiter was constantly stopping by, the food came out quickly, and I was totally impressed. 

I, for one, am completely pro-sweet breakfasts. So for me, this was my ideal spot. I live in Akron, but I'll definitely be back & bringing my friends."}
{"text":"After having a bad experience and deciding to leave a different trendy local restaurant (without having eaten), my partner and I made our way to Jack Flaps in hopes of salvaging an enjoyable brunch. We definitely made the right choice!! Not only was the food great (and about half the price of the first place), but the staff was extremely friendly and considerate and they went out of their way to take care of us. I love finding places with excellent staff, as it makes such a difference. I had a simple breakfast of eggs and the potato & root vegetable hash, but it was delicious. I can't wait to go back on a day when I have more of a sweet tooth and try some of their pancakes!"}
{"text":"\"I dare them to make something that doesn't taste good.\" So said an out-of-town friend, mouth half-full of pancake, between soft sighs of pleasure. I feel as if Jack Flaps would take that challenge and both regrettably and enthusiastically succeed. Their only failing could be that their diner-style coffee was *not* terrible, which is arguably a main selling point of diner-style coffee.

Having been recommended to the joint by many a trendy friend and blog, I dragged two blithe spirits and my boyfriend into the 5th Street Arcades location and made to test the waters. We had to wait a little bit (no more than 10 minutes) before being seated, but being as we made it there at 1pm for brunch on a Sunday, this was quite understandable.

The usual tragedy of breakfast food for Celiac types is here averted: buckwheat pancakes (with no added regular-wheat flour!) are offered for gluten-sensitive types (I didn't specifically say Celiac out of a compulsion to avoid being That Guy and also because I don't completely wilt when exposed to trace amounts) - and go deliciously with nearly all the toppings offered.

Thus buoyed by the excitement of eating Actual Pancakes at A Restaurant for Regular People, I ordered the honey-brie flapjacks, despite usually neither liking honey nor brie. I figured I was blessed with the ability to order something I didn't have to like, so I had to. And wouldn't you know it, the stack of cheese, honey and cake-of-pan was delicious, balanced and...dare I say exciting? Perhaps that's a bit much.

Root-vegetable hash was, in fact, a password for delicious cubed hash browns with other veggies in them. The ketchup looked like hot sauce, the hot sauce looked like ketchup, everything was amazing and i and my group sat there worshipping the spread as we consumed it. The bacon? Oh, the bacon. thick and rich and juicy-not-greasy. 

Should you go? Yes, if you enjoy breakfasts just this side of transcendent, and don't mind trying the weird thing you're not sure you'll like (and it's quite likely you will.)"}
{"text":"I had my first experience today and I can't wait to go back with other friends and family. The wait went quickly and the service was great! I had the carrot cake waffle and it was delicious! The butternut squash was an awesome addition to typical carrot cake recipe. I'm not a frequent waffle eater, but it was definitely one of the best I've had! My friend got the lemon curd pancakes which were also delicious. I was definitely in the clean plate club today!"}
{"text":"A friend and I shared the f'ing burrito and the lemon curd pancakes. Both were delicious but the pancakes were the best!  Can't wait to go back and try one of the waffles!"}
{"text":"So good! Burrito is always amazing and the pancakes are heavenly. I wish they would bring back the carrot cake waffle, that was the best breakfast dish in cleveland!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  The best pancakes I've ever tasted.  Fresh ingredients.  Friendly and fast service.  Amazing menu.  

I had the Lemon Curd Jack Flaps.  Absolutely delicious.  I also ordered a side of hash browns...These were good but slightly undercooked."}
{"text":"My first experience was a complete success . Went to brunch and ordered the breakfast burrito . I was great ! Huge portion with so much flavor and perfect amount of spice. 
The next few times I ordered pretty much everything on the menu without a complaint. The food is prepared with good live and care, and the staff does the best job possible . 

Only negative aspect is the one server and one cook deal . when it gets busy, the wait can be longer than it should be ."}
{"text":"The menu is very limited, but the waffles were good. I liked the cereal-milk whipped cream. The coffee was tasty as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast!! The eggy bread was delicious Great staff!! Definitely coming back when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We stopped by yesterday and left.  The group in line ahead of us were a party of 4.  We were next in line - a party of 5.  A table for 4 and a table for 6 opened up simultaneously.  The host sat the party of 4 at the table for 6 and grabbed 2 people behind us in line to sit at the table for 4.  I protested - the host stared blankly.  Genius move!  This left 4 open chairs (instead of 1) and took us somewhere else where we had a great meal.."}
{"text":"I was told that Jack Flaps was going to be a worth-while destination, and I am usually open to new food experiences, but from the moment I walked into this restaurant I was nervous. I can handle the size and the minimalist interior, but the pictures throughout the room exhibited a sense of pretentiousness that I don't appreciate. I can do snobby, but hipster pretentiousness doesn't sit well with me. But looking past the atmosphere, I must say that the food was fairly good, after I got over the shock of the cost. Actually, the cost didn't bother me initially. It was after I received a plate with two pancakes that I got a little salty. Nine dollars for two thin pancakes isn't going to put me in a good mood no matter how delightful the food may be. I understand that there are many places out there with high costs and small portions, especially when quality comes into play, but the quality and price here do not match up. I love breakfast food, and Jack Flaps could have potential, but the high cost and small servings do not meet the needs of this breakfast connoisseur.

Give it a try to form your own opinion, or go somewhere else and save your time and money."}
{"text":"Me and the wife found this place on yelp and wow was it good! Don't be scared of the ingredients they use to make their food, some of the stuff I never heard of, it's how they cook it makes it taste amazing! Quality homemade food that's worth every penny! The hash brows my wife had was to die for! This place might become a favorite!! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after many recommendations from friends. There was a 45 minute wait for a seat at the bar; a wait which is not totally unusual for a popular Cleveland-area brunch spot on a Sunday morning. I ordered the Fat Elvis waffles. Or I should say waffle, because for $10 you only get one waffle. Sure, there are some diced bananas and peanut butter and praline bacon bits on it, but still - I've never ordered waffles or pancakes from any restaurant (sans their kids menu) where you only get a stack of one. And it was a pretty ordinary waffle at that. The coffee was ok, and I ordered a couple eggs so I didn't leave there still starving that were ok, too. The servers were nice. But size matters, though, and none of the other dishes around me screamed \"that's a lot of food\".

 I would definitely recommend Coventry Inn, Lucky's, or Borderline over Flap Jacks. You'll still have the same annoying 30 min-hour wait to get seated, but you'll get much more food for your money."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Small and quaint inside with some really good flapjacks! I got the buckwheat pancakes and my husband got the Fat Elvis. We also had coffee and a side of root hash. Everything was delicious! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. .....will definitely add to my favorites list!! A bit pricey, but worth it for a yummy treat!!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Great Ohio City vibe. Pancakes and waffles are a delight for those who like sweet. Worth the wait! Veggie hash and grits are also worth a try!"}
{"text":"Loved it! The menu is very \"dessert breakfast\" oriented which suits me just fine. I got the lemon curd and berry compote pancakes and they were amazing. The house made lemon curd was a real winner and the house made syrup contains cardamon which gives it a nice rich warmth. My dad went for a savory option with the breakfast bahn mi, and that was also awesome. We didn't have to wait for a table because we were okay with sitting at a \"shared table\" and met two lovely interesting people who live in the neighborhood. Coffee was great, service was kind and attentive but not rushing us out. I think we will definitely become regulars at jack flaps!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch at Jack Flaps and I will certainly be back. The menu was excellent and contained several dishes that sounded/looked phenomenal. Being that I'm a seasoned veteran in the brunch game I obviously ordered the breakfast burrito because in my experience this is the most reliable barometer to assist in developing an overall conclusion on the deliciousness of the menu. I only made it through a few bites before drowning the burrito in the house made hot sauce which was fairly hot but extremely tasty. The coffee situation was on point as patrons are provided with a to-go cup and all the appropriate fixins' are readily available on the table. Our server was very polite and the vibe of the restaurant was very casual and relaxing. The server made certain to fill up my to-go cup with coffee when she presented the check which was a small touch that I appreciated as I have an unhealthy caffeine addiction. I would probably hesitate to bring a group much larger than 4 here due to limited seating and a generally long wait depending on time of arrival."}
{"text":"Went here after 1pm on a Sunday and the place was packed.  Apparently, there's a special after 1 where pancakes are only 5$.  We ended up being seated at the bar which was fine. 

I ordered the lemon pancakes and my friend got the candied jalepano pancakes with bacon.  The pancakes are super sweet...almost too much so.  The bacon was well cooked. 

The major problem was that it took us almost an hour to get pancakes.  

Additionally, I can't eat that much sugar without slipping into a diabetic coma.  I'd recommend they offer an option to just get one pancake paired with eggs or a protein.  

The space is nice and cozy and the staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Terrible Service; okay food!
Sunday brunch.  Party of 2. Told there was a 30 minute wait.  Finally got a table an hour and a half later. Sat for over 10 minutes before being greeted and getting water (many servers passed us by and did nothing). Food came out quickly.  Quality was ok, but not worth the wait.  Multiple servers passed our table and never cleared the dirty dishes. Will not be going back; too many other great options.  Grumpy's in Trement is MUCH better all aroound!!!"}
{"text":"This is a terrific place for brunch. We came around 1pm on a Saturday and were seated in around 10 minutes. Make sure to take advantage of their 1-3 happy hour, where pancakes and waffles are only 5$!

Portions are generous, and the pancakes are cooked to be fluffy and just buttery enough. We shared orders of the Lemon Curd flapjack as well as the Graham Cracker waffle. I highly recommend the Lemon Curd waffle, as the added graham cracker adds a great crunch and the slight tart of the lemon all go great together. The graham cracker waffle was also very yummy and reminiscent of s'mores.

Their savory items are also enjoyable, although not as good as their sweet items. The SOS, a biscuits and gravy sort of contraption, was gigantic, although I was not a fan of the slaw on top (tastes a bit like kimchi). My friend ordered the burrito which was quite good, and the breakfast bahn mi was also well-received."}
{"text":"Incredible establishment! We had the pancakes. I had the lemon curd and he had the original with Guinness chocolate topping! Very tasty and very filling. I would come back again and again to try all of their unique creations."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this Cleveland favorite yesterday.  My sister and I had a fun time exploring the menu; there are so many creative options that we wanted to try them all!  If this place could make a sampler plates, that would be perf.

My sister got the candied jalapeno jackflaps and I got the creme bruleed vanilla bean rice pudding, and we both got sides of breakfast kimchi.  

My sister said the jalapeno jackflaps were phenomenal, fluffy and perfectly cooked, with a jalapeno flavor (which, disappointingly, wasn't spicy) that was well complimented by the delicious berry compote.  She didn't offer me a bite :( so I can't add any personal input.  

The rice pudding was delicious; i think the \"creme bruleed vanilla bean\" portion of the title was misleading because it really just tasted like normal rice pudding to me, but it was such a unique breakfast option and had that yummy berry compote on top.  I found myself in one of those situations where I was full but just kept eating because my food was so yummy!  

My sister and I both liked the kimchi - but my opinion of the dish changed soon after we left when my mouth was ablaze with a remnant garlic nast.  This lasted about 12 hours, and was not cured by toothbrushing or mouthwash.  Too much garlic is typical of Eric Williams restaurants, though; unless you enjoy 24 hours of grossing people out with your garlic breath.  I will not order this dish again.

As far as customer service goes, our server was very friendly, personable, and charming.  He checked up on us and kept our water full.  The perfect server, in my opinion.  The restaurant has a trendy and energizing mood, but is pretty small.  I can't imagine ever trying to come here on a Saturday because I'm sure the wait is astronomical, but it is the perfect size for a weekday brunch.

I'll be back!! Can't wait to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Crowded, rightfully so the breakfast was worth the wait. Grits with cinnamon n butter YUM. Get out from downtown n go here!"}
{"text":"Love the area & intimate ambiance of the restaurant. The staff was very friendly and met some really great people while eating at the bar."}
{"text":"I've been to Jack Flaps twice now.  The first time I had the SOS (creamed \"chipped beef\" over challah with red pepper vinaigrette and Napa slaw).  The server suggested adding sunny side up eggs. Great recommendation!  Absolutely loved this dish. 

One my first visit, I was pleasantly surprised by the small and cozy atmosphere.  No tables were available, but the server suggested I sit at a 6-top with a couple of older gentlemen.  I'm always game for \"community table\", so I plopped down and had some fun banter with the guys sitting there already.

Service was good - the perfect service for a business lunch.  Drinks, food, and check were prompt.  

I went for my second time today - another business lunch.  I tried the Shrimp & Grits (peppers, onions, creole vinaigrette, bacon creme fraiche).  The server (again!!) suggested I add sunny side up eggs.  Hmmmm YES PLEASE.  I'm really glad the staff asks if you want to add eggs because my answer is always \"yes\".

Overall - this place is a great spot for a great brunch or lunch.  I've heard the wait is insane on the weekend, so I have only been during the week to avoid crowds and get some work done."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to this place based on reviews and photos... but upon arriving at 11am on a Monday, we discovered around eight people waiting to be seated for brunch. We stood in line for 15 minutes waiting to be seated, meanwhile there were empty tables waiting to be cleared and only one waitress was milling about attending all tables at a sluggish pace. Eventually we sat down at the bar but it took another 10 minutes to get the attention of the waitress. By now we'd been there for almost a half hour so we put in our food order right away and asked for coffee... our waitress  forgot our coffee and we had to remind her later to please serve us. Eventually the food came and it was just ok. By the time we left our Monday brunch had turned into a two hour commitment and our food was simply mediocre."}
{"text":"An attentive staff accompanied by a unique and delicious menu of breakfast and brunch options. For the quality of food, the price is completely acceptable. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Terrific menu offering tasty and unique choices!! Had the shrimp and grits and they were outstanding. Out of the box in most breakfast joints means something wild like a Denver omelette that might include onions and cheese. Not here, everything is different and very good."}
{"text":"This is a very cool, hip breakfast spot in Ohio City.  Heard about it through friends and other reviews.  Definitely worth coming.  We had the Banh Mi sandwich, Raspberry Crisp waffle and a side of Vietnamese sausage.  The sandwich was out of this world tremendous! Fresh with tons of flavor and great bread.  The waffle was not crisp and just an okay flavor profile.  I'll be back though to try the pancakes though.  The coffee is quality and the staff was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"We have been to JackFlaps before and always loved the vibe, decor, and definitely the food. On our last visit we were incredibly disappointed by the poor service, enough so to write a negative review. We waited over 30 minutes for someone to take our order and they forgot parts of our order after repeated reminders. While the food was amazing (per usual) we waited another 30 minutes after finishing for someone to give us a check, then another 10 for someone to take the credit card. Overall, while the food is good, the service was lazy and it was nearly possible to get someone's attention. Don't go unless you have 2 hours to be ignored."}
{"text":"Arrived on Monday, 12/26 about 9:30am for breakfast, family of 4.  Did not have chocolate milk available for kids.  Husband got the croque madame - huge  portion, he said it was OK.  I got the pecan pie pancakes - large portion, but basically pancakes with some pecans on them - way oversold the description.   Kids got pancakes and waffle - basic.  Seating for 10-15 tables, in addition to some bar seating - line was out the door by the time we left - not real sure why.  Was a disappointing visit."}
{"text":"have eaten at jack flaps on several visits.  each visit is like the last, enjoyable and well crafted food. not for the ihop crowd."}
{"text":"Had the Breakfast Bahn Mi, the root vegetable hash and the Mexican Coke Braised Bacon. All the food was great, but the bacon stole the show. Order the Bacon."}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant sounds like a weird sexual position or some kind of genitalia... it makes me feel awkward. 
The food, however, is not awkward in any way! 
On Saturday after 1:00 there is happy hour and flaps (hehehe) are only $5! A table of 4 girls ordered about 9 entrees; there wasn't enough space on our table for the amount of food we ordered so we stacked things on our water glasses. This was secondary to the fact that we arrived already starving, this place is tiny and there aren't a lot of tables, they must be making pancakes on a George Foreman because it took forever to get our food. 
Despite the painfully agonizing, grumbly wait, the food was delicious! Everything was hot, nothing was soggy, great innovative flavor. If this place wasn't such a goddamn gut-tease with all its waiting, I'd come here more often. 

While writing this, I've just had a stroke of genius. Have first-breakfast and THEN come here for second-breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"The four stars are for the food, but the service was meh. The one time our server checked in on our table was to ask if she could take plates away. Uh, there were 3 of us and NO ONE was even close to being done. The ladies were pleasant though, but getting not so great service is better than getting rude service in my book. 
FOOD: ordered the coffee pork belly side, lemon curd jack flaps, the burrito, and the mexicano dish. If you want plain bacon, then this is for you but don't expect anything special.at.all. 
I really wanted heat with the Mexicano dish because it reminded me of huevos rancheros but with a spin on textures. This was my favorite along with the lemon curd. If it was widely accepted to lick plates clean while dining out...well, let's just say I got close."}
{"text":"Stopped by while I was in town visiting my parents. My father is a fan of Momocho, and I've eaten at and enjoyed El Carnicero, so I had high hopes for this breakfast spot owned by Eric Williams. We came on a Monday to avoid the crowds.

It was about 10AM when we arrived, but the waitress was as sluggish as if it was 7AM. She even informed us she was \"Still very tired\" after my father asked her to speak up so he could hear her over the music. I'm not sure why The Shins were blasting at 10AM, but it was pretty darn loud for a restaurant with only three tables occupied. I get it Jack Flaps, you think you're really hip.

So they were out of the smoked deviled eggs and the korean breakfast sausage, which seemed odd for a Monday morning, but would have been fine had we been told upon being seated, but instead the waitress waited till we ordered and had to come back to tell us they were out of things- twice. 

The pancakes were fine, but nothing to write home about. I had high hopes because they all sounded so interesting, but the execution was only so-so. There needed to be more strawberries on the strawberry shortcake, and more lemon curd on the lemon curd pancakes. The pancakes themselves were totally fine, but if you're going to open a pancake themed restaurant, shouldn't they be awesome, not just good? 

The pork belly bacon was good, but for all it's boasting of being coke-glazed, it didn't have very much coke flavor. 

All in all, I think Eric Williams is overstretching himself with this place. It's trying way too hard to seem hip, while serving food that is good, but not exciting.  Probably wouldn't return, but it wasn't exactly a bad meal either, aside from the lackluster service."}
{"text":"you forgot to give me napkins and utensils for my to go order. So what I am supposed to do with a giant mess that's about to fall apart burrito that's also leaking through its box? It also had a popped fried egg that spilled onto my coffee. You guys know how to ruin a customer's morning. Hope these pitcures validate my poor rating."}
{"text":"Service 
The waitress was friendly and very efficient.  She kept re-filling our coffee and made sure we had everything we needed. 

The Fat Elvis Waffle
It was delicious. Love the fluffy PB especially. The pork belly bacon was smokey delicious.

Lemon Curd Flapjack
I really liked the combo of lemon and berries with the graham cracker to balance out the sweetness. The pancakes were really fluffy and delicious even without the toppings. Oh and they're still good as leftovers!

Apple Pie Flapjack
Couldn't have been better, Two pancakes doesn't seem like a lot but they were thick and well made.  The caraway was delicious, not too much to overpower the flapjacks themselves.  The crumb was perfect to compliment it.  

Carrot Cake Waffle 
The waffle itself was very good. I loved the little pieces of carrot inside of it. The butternut squash butter cream was amazing! It was a perfect compliment to the toasted coconut. I just wish it came with more butternut squash butter cream. Definitely order a side if you are getting a waffle. 

Coffee 
The coffee was good. It was better than the typical diner coffee. Really liked the to-go cups, much easier to take my coffee with me."}
{"text":"I am a total foodie. Not only do I enjoy the taste of food but I love to look at food. Pair that with a quaint, yet upscale restaurant, smiling faces and amazing natural lighting and well you've just won me over. Jack Flaps was all of these things and more. A quick 15 minute wait to get a table allowed me and my brunching friends to roam the antiques corridor of Lorain Ave. Once seated inside we enjoyed the buzz of light conversations from neighboring tables and set out to decide what we should eat. It was a difficult decision for me as everything sounded delicious. My favorite brunch item is eggs benedict and Jack Flaps has its own unique twist called the Cuyahoga Benedict. I wasn't sure how I felt about fish and eggs so I opted for something a bit more classic. Two eggs, sunny side up, handmade sausage and root vegetable hash. I also ordered Rye bread on the side. My friends opted for the breakfast burrito and the breakfast bahn mi. Everyone gushed over their food when it came to the table and we were delighted to see Jack Flaps encouraged the instagramming of food pics. They were spoiling us I swear! The food looked great and tasted better. The breakfast sausage had such a unique blend of flavors and the root vegetable hash was out of this world. Huge compliments to everyone at Jack Flaps for such a wonderful brunch experience! Can't wait to go back - I'm thinking of ordered Jackflaps at my next visit."}
{"text":"My friend and I got there around 9:30 for Sunday brunch and there was already a line starting to form. Being hungover, the waitress was very attentive to me and my friends need for water and refilled our glasses as soon as we finished them. We both got the Mexican benedict which was off the charts good. The only downside was the size of the place (really small) and the fact that they didn't serve bloody mary's or mimosas."}
{"text":"Good little breakfast addition to the hood.  The Happy Jack was a great combination of flavors, with a hotdog baked into the waffle and topped with greens and a delicious cream cheese (and adding a fried egg).  Sounded iffy, I know, but they nailed it.  Staff was very friendly and attentive.  We will definitely put this place into the weekend breakfast/brunch rotation and look forward to trying more."}
{"text":"Gluten Free pancakes...um...YES!!!! Jack Flaps is a small hipster diner that serves amazing breakfast. I go here at least once a month because the pancakes are so fluffy and yummy that you cannot help but love them. The portion sizes are pretty big so be prepared to be stuffed or have to take some home. I also get a side of eggs (over-easy) and the Vietnamese sausage, which are great. 

The coffee is pretty standard, but I know lots of people swear by it. I haven't tried any other waffle or pancake creations yet because I pretty much love my plain packages.

If you are going to go on the weekend make sure you get there super early because it gets packed quickly."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot with an eclectic menu. Generous portions, great prices and very polite staff."}
{"text":"Small place but we got seated quickly. The burrito was huge and tasty. Lemon curd pancakes were awesome. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The service is terrible and the food is even worse. I live in Ohio City so I know there are all types of jewels in this neighborhood. Sadly, to say this is not one of them. I was highly disappointed the food was disgusting, I have never left a restaurant to go to another one.  It was not busy however, we stood waiting to be seated for about 10 minutes. Mind you tables were open and it wasn't busy.  We order the shrimp and grits and the Real F'ing Breakfast Burrito. The shrimp grits taste like hot sauce and vinegar. It only had about 4 or 5 baby shrimp in it. The grits were creamy and ok but the rest was terrible. Now the Breakfast Burrito was dry , salty and just gross my daughter could not even eat it. I did end up eating a couple of bites because I was starving. I ended up sending both plates back. I figured since we sent both plates back with all of the food in tack that the waitress might ask me was everything ok but that never happen. When the second waitress came over I told her that \" the food was disgusting\" she spoke with the manager and she ended up taking the shrimp & grits off, She also said that I should have told them right away that the food sucked. I responded that when the plates are returned in tack that should be an indication that I was not happy. I mean its not rocket science if plates come back empty food was great if not food was disgusting."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The interior has a great vibe and the service staff were very friendly and helpful. The lemon curd pancakes were phenomenal along with the pear waffles. The best thing on the menu in my opinion was the rice pudding. The best I've ever had.  It's covered with granola and berry sauce. I highly recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"I have been pining for Red Velvet pancakes for ages, so I was really excited to see them on the menu but the pancakes lacked a real \"red velvet\" flavor and the icing on top was cloying.
 If you like a really sweet breakfast, this might be the place for you but I would love to see some other options besides sugary dessert like meals. 
It would also be a perfect place to take your kids of you don't mind dropping 10 bucks on a plate of pancakes for them!"}
{"text":"Scrumptious! We had the breakfast burrito, which my boyfriend said was the best he's ever had. I ordered the breakfast banh mi sandwich which was fantastic. And we split an order of the tiramisu pancakes, which were out of this world! The espresso cream was divine. Such a treat! Good coffee too (hate going to a good breakfast spot that has bad coffee). It's a small place, so not sure about getting a table when super busy. We were there early on a Sunday morning (before 8:30), and by the time we finished our delicious meal the dining room was full and people were waiting for tables. As an FYI, pricing is about $10 a plate."}
{"text":"I loved jackflaps. Awesome atmosphere cool pics on the wall, unique menu. Everyone was friendly. The only thing I was bummed about was that the chocolate on the marshmallow waffle had hazelnut in it and there wasn't a substitute form of chocolate so I couldn't order what I wanted because I have a nut allergy  :(. 

The pork belly was awesome! The coke in the glass bottle was awesome. The grits were kind of bland but I'm pretty sure they are supposed to be. The gravy on the sos sandwich was very good I recommend getting it with eggs because the yolk makes the dish better than it already is!"}
{"text":"Terrible Dining experience.  Slow Food

I heard great things about this place so we decided to try it.
  
I had the Lemon Curd Pancakes which were awesome even though I dont recall a graham cracker crust. My friend had original jackflaps, she found them & the syrup to be overwhelmingly sweet. We asked for scrambled eggs with cheese but instead got over-hard fantastically seasoned eggs so we kept them; and the mexican coke braised bacon (which they decided to serve both sides on one plate) was an acquired taste. My friend didn't like it and I sent mine back to be cooked longer.

Randy came over to our table to check on everything, we gave him honest feedback for our first time experience.  He seemed taken aback that we were less than thrilled by some aspects of our selections.  As he cleared our table and handed us our check, I made mention that 2 orders of bacon were on the check even though we sent one back to the kitchen. He stated that nothing was \"wrong\" with the bacon so he couldn't just \"take it off\".  We debated the issue for a min, where I conceded and just decided to pay the check and get out of there.  When I asked the server about the \"happy hour pricing\" because the time on the check was 1pm, she stated that she took our order before 1pm so we were not eligible.  

I was totally outdone with this lack of accommodation, especially considering our discontent regarding the meal.  They totally lacked a hospitable spirit and I will never patronize this establishment again.

{"text":"Decent. They make everything from scratch which is a nice idea but lends to some different takes on household mainstays. for example the ketchup was thin and over seasoned more like a salsa. He sausage patties were thin and dry tasted like a cardboard turkey burger. Reasonable prices and portions. Ok vibe and atmosphere. I prolly won't be back though."}
{"text":"Great food selection. Well designed and very well executed. I got the Bahn Mi sandwich and split a waffle. I can't wait to come back for the burrito!"}
{"text":"Well I will have to agree with other reviews that the majority of the pancake and waffle selections are a bit too sweet for breakfast (at least for me).  

With that said, I loved this place.  I had heard/ read many mixed reviews, so I couldn't wait to try it for myself.  I had the Old Standard (two eggs - scrambled, sausage, and root hash).  Very tasty breakfast!  The root hash was unlike anything I have ever had before.  I am not sure exactly what was in it (aside from potatoes) but it was delicious and the seasonings were right on.  The sausage, also really good.  You get two pretty big sized patties and again, perfect seasoning and spices added.  The eggs were fairly standard, they were good, but nothing to write about.

My boyfriend ordered the Breakfast Banh Mi.  His dish was awesome!  I really loved it.  All of the flavors (Vietnamese sausage, fried egg and kimchi) just melded together perfectly and were so tasty.  It comes on a big baguette with a side of everything bagel cream cheese.  The cream cheese tastes just like an everything bagel (my favorite).  The sandwich is quite large so that when you eat it, you pretty much need a knife and fork more than being able to just pick it up with your hands.  

I really didn't think the prices were that bad.  Total was about $20 for two meals and two coffees (not including tip).  We both walked away completely satisfied, not overstuffed but not wanting more.  

Overall I really enjoyed my meal (and the boyfriends).  I will definitely be back again. But I really want to go back and try one (or more) of the yummy looking sweet options, especially the red velvet waffle."}
{"text":"Parking was not terrible - there were a few spots across the street that were free. 

Service is one of the main reasons I'm giving it a 3 star rating. I was seated for a good 15 minutes before I was offered a menu and had to wait/grab the attention of a waitress to place my order. At the end when I asked for silverware to go, the waitress literally just tossed it at me. I did not have a great experience mostly because of the service to be honest. 

The food I would say was a 3-4 star. I ordered a savory item but I would still be interested in trying one of the jackflaps/sweet menu options."}
{"text":"I had my first experience at jack flaps today(1-26-14) and it definitely won't be my last. After checking out the menu online to see what they had to offer I understood this wasn't your typical breakfast place. I decided on the \"fat elvis\" and a side of the coke braised slab bacon. The flavors of the peanut butter, bananas and bacon tasted great on top of the waffles. The thicker cut of bacon was a nice change instead the thinly sliced bacon you'd normally eat at any other breakfast spot. The thicker cut seemed to pack more of a flavor too. I sampled a few bites from the plates of the others I was with and tried the candied jalapeño jackflaps along with the crab benedict. Both of those items did not disappoint either. Our server named Kevin was excellent and very friendly. The rest of the staff were on top of it too with clearing any empty plates and refills, but not to the point of being annoying. I'd definitely recommend getting there early as it filled up quick after we arrived at 9am. Overall if you're looking for a fun and delicious breakfast experience it's worth stopping in to Jack Flaps."}
{"text":"Meh. Waffle was like dense angel food cake. Toast was cold and hard. Eggs super greasy. Ketchup was some bizarre watery mixture of spices. Overall I feel gross after eating there."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday morning (10:30ish) for brunch. The food was phenominal and the wait staff were all great. Only criticism is that they could improve the wait time and flow. While I definitely appreciate not being rushed out of a restaurant, we did spend more time than expected waiting for a table and food. Nevertheless, I would still go back to try all of the amazing sounding options, since the food we did eat was so great!! (Side note, you can purchase their home made hot sauce! My husband loved it with his breakfast burrito and bought two bottles before we left.)"}
{"text":"Really good food, big portions and priced very reasonably. It is a small restaurant so it does get really crowded. The \"Real F'ing Breakfast Burrito\" is so good! The root vegetable hash is also to die for."}
{"text":"Wow! Celebrated my 28th anniversary at this fabulous restaurant.  A half -hour wait 
was well worth it, just be forewarned that this place is jumping! My group had the breakfast burrito, shrimp & grits, creamed chipped beef over challah and a \"fat Elvis\" waffle. Also a couple sides of the Vietnamese sausage patties. The creamed chipped beef was enough for 2- easily! Every dish was amazing- we all tasted each other's dishes and agreed. Really good coffee , too. Get online and look at the menu- everything looks delicious and it IS! Very different and inventive recipes. The waitress was friendly and attentive despite the crowd. We can't wait to go back to Jack Flaps!j"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and tried the Veg Root Hash and the grits with brown sugar butter. The first time everything was delicious and had a nice sized portion. The second time I didn't like it. The hash wasn't seasoned well and the portion size was not the same. When I went the first time the girl at the register forgot my butter but when she went to get it she was fiddling around with her nose, yuck! You shouldn't work with money, play with your nose and then attempt to get peeps food, not a good look. Overall it was a cool little hipster place in the heart of a gentrified neighborhood but I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Went in there for lunch and was the only person in there. Tried there pancakes and they were the driest pancakes I've ever had. Loading it up with maple syrup didn't help either."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much everything I could ever want in a breakfast place. Tons of savory options (because I usually choose those over sweet), great coffee, and a well-known restaurateur at its helm. Not to say that I only go to places that are \"well-known\" or where a famous chef resides, but it doesn't hurt that I love me some Eric Williams.

Anyway. I came here twice. The first time was for a ladies' brunch on a weekend; the second, for a casual early morning breakfast on President's Day. The first time, it was chaos, but people weren't yelling at each other or being obnoxious. We waited with dignity, and we even got coffee in to-go cups while we waited, pretending we weren't starting out of our minds. The second time, we got seated right away. Both times, the service was excellent, and the dishes were phenomenal.

Ok. Right off the bat. CANDIED JALAPENO PANCAKES. I mean, right?!?!?! Redonk. I also had the breakfast burrito (one time sans burrito), and it was great too.

So really, there's nothing negative I can think of except maybe the wait and/or lack of space? But, see, that's what singletons and/or the childless need to experience so that they won't feel like killing themselves when they get seated right away at Bob Evans. It's a give-and-take, know what I mean?"}
{"text":"LOVE at first bite- Every time!

I am a big fan of this place! The concept is especially awesome because there is no other restaurant in Cleveland like this one. While some people may complain that it is too small, I think that's one of the best things about this place. It has a high turn around rate of customers and with the place being small I think it keeps the menu at a perfect size. I have tried a variety of items here and find each one to be just as delicious as the last! 

I also love the idea of serving the coffee in a to go cup! Free refills and coffee on the go when you are ready to leave."}
{"text":"Came in for Sunday brunch at around 12:45 Am. The food was absolutely delicious- we ordered the butternut squash waffle and braised beef waffle. Both dishes were very savory!! 
The reason I give them a 4 and not a 5 would be 1) we had to wait 45 minutes to get seated 2) they don't serve any alcoholic beverages 3) they don't have a cappuccino machine, pretty much the only thing you can order for a drink is either coffee or juice. 
Otherwise, we loved the experience. We were extremely well fed and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  Why spend your money at some assembly-line, chain restaurant, where everything on the menu tastes the same. A great place with creative dishes and a great cup of coffee. Some reviews knock the prices, but you'll go home satisfied with a full belly and a smile on your face! Get the Fat Elvis, pork belly, and the grits. Service is always great and friendly."}
{"text":"This place had a lot of great reviews so I decided to check it out with a friend. I was expecting greatness but in reality I got average food at an above average price."}
{"text":"We went to Jackflaps on a Thursday afternoon and they still had a nice crowd. We sat at the bar where we laughed and joked with the staff. Everyone there is very friendly. It's a relaxed atmosphere with a modern day spin on food. The grits and Vietnamese sausage is to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm not super crazy about sweets, but Jack Flaps is pretty darn good at them! We had to wait for a bit, but that was OK (even though there were some children that were getting on my nerves in the very small waiting area). It gave me time to peruse the menu and have my mind made up by the time we were seated. 

I was pleased to find that they had YooHoo on the menu, so immediately jumped on that opportunity. I was then torn between a savory selection or a sweet one, but decided that for my first visit, I'd go for what they're named for! I got the Cracker Jack pancake, which was actually less sweet than I expected--a pleasant surprise! The corn nuts in the pancake are awesome and I really enjoyed my breakfast. The side I got, though, was so good that I regretted eating so much pancake and feeling ALMOST too full. Definitely try the root vegetable hash. So delicious! Also, they have pancake happy hour when you can get the cakes for $5. That definitely helped for me, especially when getting something as simple as pancakes (I wasn't entirely keen on spending $9 on something that isn't my favorite breakfast food). 

I'm really looking forward to coming back and trying some savory dishes and getting a better feel for the place. I really wasn't disappointed in anything and think this place has great hungover Saturday morning potential."}
{"text":"I got the Eastern Forest and a cup of coffee. It was very good. My only qualm is the lack of seating. You either get lucky and can sit right away or you don't and have to wait 30 minutes"}
{"text":"Food looked better then it tasted. Barely any seasoning. Service was okay. Atmosphere was nice but kinda small space."}
{"text":"Cola-soaked pork belly and seasonal vegetable hash are both fantastic. I eat here whenever I visit Cleveland and have never been disappointed, though my girlfriend was not a fan of the pancakes."}
{"text":"Jack Flaps almost always nails it. Only one time was my meal too sweet for me, but they typically do a great job at balancing the sweetness in their pancakes/waffles."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Jack Flaps for a long time. It was decent. I'd go again as there were a few items on the menu I'd like to try. It was sort of hit or miss with what we ordered. Comments on what we ordered:

- lemon curd pancakes with a graham cracker crust and berry jam: The graham cracker \"crust\" was golden grahams cereal sprinkled on top of the pancakes. The pancakes were decent - no different than you'd get anywhere else. The lemon curd with berry jam was excellent. Pretty delicious overall. 

- creamsickle pancakes with blood orange batter, cream and orange marmalade drizzle: the pancakes were less unappetizing as they were red in color, and they did not have a blood orange flavor. They were really f-ing dense. More like dense and thick cake than light and fluffy pancakes. Cream and marmalade drizzle was good. Wouldn't order again as too heavy and sweet. 

- mexican coke glazed pork belly - hell. no. This was not good. The pork belly was flabby and the smoky flavor totally overwhelmed it. Not crispness. No melting in the mouth. A plate of sadness. 

- root veggie hash - Excellent.

The coffee they serve is good, but I hate the unnecessary waste as all coffee is served in paper cups. That's useful ONLY if you're actually going to take your coffee to go.  

Service is friendly and good. The space is pretty small so if you have a group of people, go early or you'll be waiting in line staring at all of the people eating and that's no fun. 

Additionally, it's kind of $$ for breakfast."}
{"text":"5 Stars for service and for food quality and creativity.  The Lemon Curd pancakes are a favorite of mine on the Sweet Side of the menu.  The bits of graham cracker and the berry jam are a nice complement to the lemon pucker.   Benedicto Mexicano (oh, that masa cake!) and the Breakfast Banh Mi have quickly become my go-to options on the Savory Side.  When I feel like mixing it up, the Winter Jam waffle combines sweet and savory with Brie and Orange-Clove Marmalade.

We are greeted every week with smiles and coffee, and no one even blinks when I ask if I can change the style of my eggs (just can't do over easy).  Jack Flaps has quickly become my favorite breakfast spot over the last year; their seasonal creativity keeps the menu fresh and the standard favorites make us feel at home...so...we have no reason to go anywhere else.  Thank you, Jack Flaps!"}
{"text":"This place has friendly service and mediocre food. I ordered scrambled eggs, hash, and pork belly as they do not have regular bacon.  The pork belly was fine, but lots of super soft fat, which I'm not fond of. The scrambled eggs were still quite wet and filled big with pieces of cracked pepper - which I am also not fond of. The hash was extremely greasy, I couldn't eat it. My husband and I shared an order of pancakes, they were huge. When they came out I thought there was 4 but really there was only 2, they're just really thick, almost cake like. These were also a let down as they had a weird aftertaste that neither my husband or I could figure out what it was. The cinnamon butter has no real cinnamon flavor, but the syrup did - so odd. I got lemon curd, on the side, which tasted more like powdered sugar with some fake lemon custard added to it. Overall it was a clean place with good service, the food was edible and got the job done, but was not very enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend this place as I feel other places have much better food."}
{"text":"Tried this as a new brunch spot today. The inside was small but not overly crowded we were seated at the bar where we were promptly asked for drink orders. It took us more than a few minutes to pick out entrees but we finally decided to split one sweet and one savory, and we did not regret it! We ordered the lavender pancakes and the pumpkin Benedict and both were flavorful and hearty. The lavender pancakes had a hint of lavender with a nice mix of caramel. The Benedict with pumpkin hollandaise was unlike any dish I had tried before. We sat close enough to the food window that we were able to see other dishes featured as well. Every dish that came through was impressive both in portion and in presentation. Our coffee was always promptly refilled (a must at breakfast). Definitely will be returning here in the future."}
{"text":"I loved the root vegetable hash. I would like to see some type of vegan protein added to the menu. I thought the pancake was good though. The staff was very friendly. THEY CAN SLICE A BANANA LIKE NINJAS! Our only complaint was the small water glasses."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday morning, and were completely prepared for a long wait (when we called ahead, they said it would be about 30-45 minutes, and they don't take advance reservations). When we got there, it was crowded, but we ended up getting seats at the bar after only about 15-20 minutes. And the staff let me get a coffee while we waited, which was a great way to make sure I was happier about waiting :-)

The food (and coffee) were excellent - we shared waffles and pancakes, and everything I tried was delicious. The service was maybe a little slow, but the place was also packed, and everyone was very calm and courteous while still making sure everything kept moving. I'd definitely come back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was so-so and the side of hash was way overpriced for being just okay.  My friend had the pancakes with lemon curd and compote.  She said it was good but a little too much sauce overwhelming the cakes.  Service was okay but rushed since the place is small with few tables.  We had to sit at a table with other people since they only have six-person group tables."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here, and the staff was very friendly.  The space is very small.  Expect to share a table with other guests.  That being said, I would go back for the food, and to purchase more hot sauce!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Denny's like breakfast go back now. This is NOT for you! 

All the details about this place make it what it is. Even the syrup has been customized by the restaurant (I read a review from someone on here upset about the 'funky' syrup and they wished they had been warned. It states on the menu that it's a cinnamon syrup). 
My lox 'bagel' was a massive waffle with pepper in the batter and everything about it was great. My husband had the candied jalapeño pancakes which had jalapeños in the batter. If you don't like heat stay away from this one!

The one reason I give them 4 instead of 5 is the location is pretty run down (just outside of Ohio city on Lorain Rd) and we had a hard time finding it even with a GPS.  The inside is immaculate though so don't confuse that with its location!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday and it was great. I had the breakfast burrito and I tried the Vietnamese style sausage on the side. The burrito was amazing! It has braised beef and potatoes inside and it's covered in tomato salsa and crema. It was actually very large and really filling. The Vietnamese sausage was also very unique in flavor. They add some Asian flavor to it which make unique. Definitely might try the breakfast bahn mi next time. The restaurant itself is very small and when you put your name down there is nowhere to wait."}
{"text":"This is a cute and cozy restaurant that is great for brunch and lunch. I went here with a friend on a Saturday, and there was a line around 12:30pm when we arrived. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated. Starting at 1pm, they have a happy hour special where the sweet waffles and Pancakes are discounted to $5 each. I ordered the Raspberry crisp waffle with a side of sunny- up eggs. Their waffles are very thick and \"cakey\" so it was very filling. I think the granola crumbs and raspberry spread were a great addition to sweeten this waffle without making it soggy. I didn't feel the need to add any syrup either! Service was friendly, polite, and accommodating. 

Overall, if you are in the mood for a variety of waffles or pancakes, I recommend this restaurant for its happy hour deal!"}
{"text":"Lots of amazing breakfast options at Jack Flaps the lemon pancakes are one of the best breakfast items I have had anywhere.  Go during the week after the morning rush and get some first class service and great food for a bargain."}
{"text":"Great food but small restaurant so be prepared to wait. I was with a group of 2 so we were seated quickly. We placed our orders but the food took over 30 min to come out. The candied jalapeño pancakes were tasty but dry since they didn't come with any sauce or syrup. They have a limited menu but a lot of different things."}
{"text":"We were excited to visit here, but were let down by the food. The pancakes were delicious. This was a Lavender Creme Brûlée flapjack and I would recommend it. 

The breakfast burrito was nothing special. The Benedicto Mexicano did not have any consistent flavor. We also had the pork belly since most Yelp reviews mentioned it, but it was flavorless and very fatty. The sausage was Vietnamese sausage. We were unsure if the sausage was bad or if it was just the over-seasoned spices in it.

We didn't have a wait on Wednesday at 10am. There were only three tables occupied, but while my husband got his coffee refilled once, our water showed up warm. After I sat for ten minutes waiting for my water to be refilled at the end of table, I had to go ask for water and later ask to get my check. If they were busy, I'd have understood the slow service."}
{"text":"The lemon curd pancakes were delicious. My only complaint with them was that the pancakes were not warm - but the lemon curd was so awesome, it still gets 4 stars. Went early on a Sat morning and didn't have to wait for a table, though it took a while to get our food out."}
{"text":"My husband picked this place, I was skeptical and hangry and it looked packed but we were sat immediately on a Sunday morning and the food was excellent. I had the punkin French toast (seasonal) and root vegetable hash and never needed lunch. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"It's a glutton's paradise. Everything is cooked perfectly and is well flavored. A-plus."}
{"text":"Original buttermilk pancakes with cinnamon butter and Guinness chocolate sauce are the shizzzzz.  The Deviled egg Benedict is not good.  The eggs had black dots on them and I was afraid to eat them (mold?) They didn't smell funny but I didn't want to take my chances.  All I was left with was a pile of micro greens, tons of mayonnaise, lox, and weird hollandaise on 2 tiny crostini.  Don't order this dish. Next time I will know better and will pick the Coke- marinated pork belly or one of the other out-of-this-world-sounding French toast or pancake entrees.  I would imagine this place gets slammed on the weekends so stick to going during the week.  It seats maybe 20 people."}
{"text":"Service and seating are abysmal but the food is just so damn good, we keep coming back!! The breakfast burrito is my personal fave. They do a ton of different flavored pancakes, waffles, French toast, etc. Cool decor, a little cramped because it's such a small place. Sometimes they seat you cafeteria style, having you share a table with other people... not my favorite. Service gets slow, too. Going there is frustrating, but the food is divine."}
{"text":"My go to spot for brunch! Beside the point that I live 2 minutes away, I come here on the reg! Two things I usually get here - \"The effing burrito\" and \"Mexican Benedict.\" Both are sooo mouth watering. They make there own hot sauce and it's amazing! Staff is always kind and you can tell they are doing something right because the wait is usually out the door every weekend!"}
{"text":"First of all, let me start off by saying I'm a really big fan of seafood on breakfast menus.  Any breakfast spot that has seafood on their breakfast menu automatically starts out ahead of their competition.  The Cuyahoga
Benedict at Jack Flaps is fabulously executed.  It's exactly what I like ina breakfast dish, although there is no egg in it, well no chicken eggs!

The Breakfast Kimchi is delightfully spicy, and so is the wait staff.  The guys are bearded and the girls are petite and nearly everyone has piercings and/or tattoos.  I've also had the Shrimp and Grits (hold the bacon) and it's great.  Coffee is very good.  Ambiance is very hip, a little on the
small side, but that adds a mystique; a fervor. Having to wait in line to get a seat boosts the popularity of the establishment.  

The artwork around the place is well done and interesting and sometimes risqué especially on the restrooms, and oh yeah, the restrooms are clean.  Lastly, good news,
they are taking over PJ's in the Old Arcade and will be serving breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Chrystal will be heading this up this effort, can't wait... Oh, and before I forget, did I mention they have a gorgeous wait
staff."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Went with a couple friends for breakfast. Huge portions, definitely got more than I expected or needed. We got there before it got busy and the place was pretty cute inside. However the space is small so seating can be an issue and the service was sooooo slow when we went, but other than that we would go again!"}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough! Stopped here for breakfast before leaving Cleveland. Great waffles! No need to order a side dish if you have a waffle, they are more than enough. Very good, would definitely recommend. They have vegan and gluten free options."}
{"text":"What a great spot for breakfast/brunch. The location can be a somewhat hard to find, you definitely have to look close when driving and looking for this spot. It's in the shape shopping block as the bike store. 

I do wish they made the entrance a bit bigger, when they are busy and have have a line of people waiting at the door, it can get a little jammed. The restaurant is somewhat on the smaller scale, it seems only about 35-40 people can fit in the dining area. 

Regardless of all that above, it's the food/experience that people Come for. Starting off with their coffee, which is delicious by the way. I ordered the f'king breakfast burrito with the side of kimchi. The burrito looks to be on the smaller scale, don't let that fool you, it will fill you up. 
The shredded beef inside was on point, they did a great job. The kimchi was delicious, it could have been made a bit more spicy, but other then that, must try here. 
My wife ordered the pancakes with the fruit on the side and she loved it. We will definitely be back to enjoy more of this food."}
{"text":"Jack Flaps serves some seriously good breakfast food. We were lucky to beat the after church brunch crowd this Sunday morning. Everything on the menu looked fabulous; from the seasonal specials to the lemon curd pancakes (which I want to come back to try), to the breakfast burrito, to the banh mi. I ordered the breakfast banh mi, a baguette sandwich with excellently seasoned Vietnamese sausage, just the right amount of spicy kimchi, cilantro, and a fried egg. However, I got to try the breakfast burrito as well and I will probably order this the next time, and maybe all the times I may return, because it was THAT GOOD. The breakfast burrito is HUGE though. You could actually split it with someone. It's wouldn't hurt to call ahead to this restaurant on a Saturday or Sunday to make sure the wait isn't too long, or to go early to make sure you beat the crowd. There aren't many tables and the whole time we were eating there was a large line of people waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Well... I didn't have flapjacks so maybe I didn't have their specialty? But I was a little disappointed. Good coffee, good service, but the breakfast was not super great. For one thing, the \"roasted root vegetable hash\" was just breakfast potatoes with a fancy name. I thought maybe there would be other root veggies in there. But it was otherwise okay. I'm glad I didn't go when there was a long wait."}
{"text":"Came with my wife the other day.  It was really hard to find this place- passed by it twice without seeing it.  They really need a sign that is higher up on the building.  Interior is industrial chic- I liked it.  There was a line to have lunch on a Monday morning.  Don't people have work to do? 

Anyways, we were seated at the bar.  The waitress was overwhelmed by the volume of people and repeated apologized for the slow service, which we appreciated.  We got the lemon curd pancakes which were delicious, though a bit more lemon curd would have been appreciated.  We got the side of root vegetable hash which was delicious and the pork belly which was interesting, but not mind blowing.  I got the breakfast ban mi.  This was a disappointment.  The meat was tasty and I liked the cilantro, but the bread was a huge disappointment.  It looked and tasted more like soft italian bread rather than the crisp baguette that usually makes a ban mi.  I wouldn't order it again.

Will we return?  Probably eventually but I don't know if I'd go at a time that isn't a happy hour.  $9 seems a lot to ask for pancakes that are light on the key ingredient."}
{"text":"I must really like this place because I went here two weekends in a row now lol.  So who doesn't love pancakes and waffles?  No friend of mine!  One of the reasons I love Jack Flaps is because they have happy hour EVERYDAY from 1-3!  Happy hour gets you any of their pancakes and/or waffles for only $5!  Yup, you read that correctly $5!  Why even go anywhere else for brunch when you can get a great meal for so cheap?  The first time I went here I wanted the tiramisu pancakes, but they were sold out.  I was so sad, but it just gave me another reason to come back.  Instead I went for a sweet and savory option and had the pork waffle.  It wasn't what I was expecting, but it was still tasty.  It was one of their signature waffles topped with roasted pork, fennel, carrots and cinnamon syrup.  My hubby ordered the special which was a ham, egg and cheese waffle sandwich with breakfast potatoes.  His was great too, actually better then mine so I was a bit jealous lol.  Like always I ended up eating a lot of his food too haha!  Anyways, we both had two large meals and two drinks for under $20!  
The next weekend came and I was really craving those tiramisu pancakes I wasn't able to get last time so I decided to go back!  I went again during happy hour and to my delight they had the pancakes!  Woohoo I was so happy :D When they came out they were glorious.  Everything I imaged they would be.  Pancakes light and fluffy, topped with creamy espresso custard, airy vanilla bean whipped cream, shaved chocolate and a crisp cannoli.  Perfection.  I also had a few cups of their coffee which is from a local coffee shop called City Roast.  Mmmmm mmmm the coffee here is great too!  My entire breakfast cost me $7.50 plus tip!  How awesome is that?!  
I'll definitely be coming back here to stuff my face with pancakes and waffles in the near future and you should too!"}
{"text":"Man oh man I finally got to experience this place a few weeks back and I must say their spin on your favorite breakfast dishes are not only on another level they are completely on the money!   

Place is a lil small but very awesome and the folks where lined up and didn't mind the wait which is a rarity in this city so this is what I had an you tell me if you would want to get more?!?"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential... but the service is going to run it into the ground. Management, please restructure the systems in place."}
{"text":"Small place so I recommend going really early or later to get a table.  All menu items are absolutely delicious.   The eggy bread, Elvis waffle, and burrito are a few favorites!"}
{"text":"It's OK. I've been here a few times because friends or family do love it, but it's not for me. The last visit I got the breakfast bahn-mi, and was very disappointed. The bread was stale, and soggy from the kimchi. Coffee was good, service is friendly, but the kitchen appears to have trouble keeping up. I will probably be back, but only because someone wants to meet me there."}
{"text":"Yesssssss!!!!!!  The F'ing Burrito and the tiramisu....soooo gooood!!!  The burritos as so full of savory flavor bite after bite.  The pancakes were light and fluffy.  Also the syrup was really tasty too.  Two thumbs way up!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food,  just seems like they're trying too hard.  Waffle and pancakes were average at best.  For the price I really expected more."}
{"text":"I hoped to come and get some bomb ass Jack flaps and I was pretty disappointed. 
Two stinken pancakes cost $8.50. I ordered them anyway hoping for the best pancakes I've ever had. 
Unfortunately, both had dough in the center of the pancakes and so did my friends. 

Just not worth the money."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Not a bad thing on the menu. Try the creamsicle pancakes.  Sounds like a lot but it is amazing. The real f'ing breakfast burrito is a good stand by.   Can be a little noisy at times."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good - I got the lemon blueberry pancakes and my date got the s'mores waffle with a side of the hash, which was really good. 

My main complaint about the restaurant was that we were ignored for 15 minutes after we had our drink orders taken. Our coffee was never delivered and our order wasn't taken by anyone. Finally we pointed out (to a different server) that no one took our order, and he was more than apologetic and got a rush on our order. Unfortunately waiting 15 minutes to even take our order (especially when it was not a full restaurant), that left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This tiny breakfast/brunch spot is a long-time favorite, but it fills up fast! Community tables and bar seating make up most of the seating, so come prepared to make some new friends :) Also, don't forget to pay attention to the fun and oversized photos on the walls!

Jack Flaps offers both sweet and savory options, none of which have ever disappointed me. If you like savory, go for the bahn mi. This time I wanted sweeter and tried a seasonal roasted peach waffle, which hit the spot without sending me into a sugar fit. 

One thing you HAVE to get when you go? The pork belly. I'm not a bacon fanatic, but I dream of this stuff. They smoke it themselves and it is marinated in Mexican Cola... you know the kind with real sugar. TRUST ME. You won't regret ordering it!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem, laid back atmosphere & wonderful delicious cuisine. The staff is just as good as the food!!! 
Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"A little over a year later and I finally made it back.  The menu has been updated and there are many more savory options.  I went with a few friends and everyone enjoyed their meals.  I got the breakfast bahn mi and it was very good.  Really tasty and it had a nice kick to it.  It won't take me another year to come back."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4. Despite some other reviewers complaints, Jack Flaps has a unique vibe to it, with its food fight fetish all over its walls.  Quarters are not that tight despite what other reviewers say, although there are a limited number of tables.  Other than not having an outdoor seating area, this is how I expect my brunch places to be.

Cost: 4. Surprisingly reasonable versus \"premium\" brunch peers like Lucky's.  Sub-$10 for most breakfast options (many of them are fairly complex and large dishes) versus $10+ at a few competitors that do the upscale brunch experience.  In other words, Jack Flaps successfully rides the line between cheap breakfast and pricey food experience.

Food Quality: 5. After having a half dozen of their dishes have yet to find a disappointment on the menu, which was primary driver to me writing this 5-start review.  On savory, I recommend Breakfast Burrito and Bahn Mi, on sweet try the Candied Jalapeno, Creamsicle, or PBJ French Toast.  The only knock is lack of alcohol (mimosas and the like would be a nice touch).  Pro tip: for hot sauce lovers, there is a nice twist on the typical.

Service: 5. Despite it generally always being busy, they are usually pretty prompt with service but not overly pushy.

When to return: 7 days a week.  Brunch with a smaller party (under 6).  Foodie moment.  Waffle craving."}
{"text":"On the rare occasions I am feeling culinarily (that can be a word!) adventurous in the a.m. I've made a beeline right to Jack Flaps, and always before 9 a.m. because this place is small and it is is very popular. You can find yourself waiting in a line stretching out the door if you arrive later.
The menu is divided between sweet and savory options and this past Saturday I was feeling sweet. I couldn't decide between the New Orleans french toast or the Bacon Brownie pancakes as they both had a delicious-sounding white chocolate sauce. I asked the waitress for her opinion and she did not hesitate for a moment -- Bacon Brownie. I asked her again. Bacon Brownie. No hesitation, huh? Bacon Brownie.
So, of course I got that while my wife tackled the savory Palookaville Benedict ($11). We also got sides of Mexican Coke-Glazed Pork Belly ($3) and the Grits with Cinnamon House Butter ($2.50).
When the Bacon Brownie ($9) came, it really looked like a giant brownie in the form of two pancakes with bacon crumble on top as well as the white chocolate sauce that was more in the form of a large dab of whipped cream. And while it tasted quite like a chocolate brownie, it was light as a pancake should be. The bacon added some great saltiness and teeth-rattling crunch. And the bitterness of the chocolate balanced the sweetness of the whipped cream. I would recommend they serve it with twice as much of the sweet topping since I ran out of the cream with almost a whole pancake still left and syrup just didn't seem like the way to go.
As for Jeannene's dish, she thought the eggs were appropriately runny (yuk!) and she, who shies away from spicy food, thought even the chilli worked well in the mixture that also included pork belly, corn bread and sour cream.
I wasn't crazy about the grits but she gladly ate the bowlful. This was the third time we've eaten here and we always get the thick, fatty pork belly thinking it's such an unusual breakfast item and I always leave wishing they had plain old crispy bacon.
I guess for breakfast I can only be so culinarily (that can be a word!) adventurous."}
{"text":"Fantastic food & great service!
The Real F'ing Breakfast Burrito is exactly that, not some scrambled egg & bacon combo with jarred salsa wrapped up like a burrito here. This place does it right, delicious adobo braised beef is the main ingredient add some hash, cheddar cheese & yes a little scrambled egg, wrapped in a warm tortilla, plated on smokey tomato salsa & topping with cool crema. If that's not F'ing real, I don't know what is!
We also got the Benedicto Mexicano. Equally delicious! Homemade jalapeño cornbread & chorizo gravy was so good I wanted to lick the plate!
This place is not big. If you go on a weekend, expect to wait & don't be rude to others once you get seated & plant roots for hours. The atmosphere is very comfortable & chill but do it during the week."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the price for some \"extras\" is crazy (OJ is $3 for a small glass). The atmosphere is fun, cool, and trendy. We will definitely be going back sans OJ."}
{"text":"Always a nice surprise when it's happy hour!! Lemon curd jackflaps and milk & cookies waffle- both only $5 and amazing! Only downside is this location is super small, so you're crowded in the waiting area and then often have to share a table with another party."}
{"text":"This place is a trendy little hole in the wall. While the wait isn't always bad, just don't be surprised if you wait over 20 minutes or are seated at a large table with strangers. 
The prices seems a bit high for what you get, but my husband and I always go during the happy hour, so it works out. The lemon curd cakes are great, especially with extra berries and curd. This is basically all we get. I've tried the root veggie hash, but the vegetables weren't cooked consistently. 
They have gluten free pancakes, and they are pretty good. :)
Overall, it's a good place to grab some food"}
{"text":"I took my mother here for Mother's Day brunch the week before Mother's Day.  We got to JF around 10am on a Sunday.  There was a small group in front of us, but we were seated quickly.

Things I liked:
Quick service.  This place is SMALL.  You share tables and that's fine with me.  They move you though.  This is NOT the place to come & camp.
Interesting menu. Mom got the lemon curd flaps and they were great.  She cleaned her plate.  I got the F&*ing breakfast burrito.  Not bad, wouldn't order it again, but it was fine.  Just not something I'd order for myself again.
Good coffee.  
Clean look.

Things I think need work:
SERVICE.  While pleasant, our server was not incredibly attentive.  I had to request water refills, glasses of ice, water refills, boxes, coffee refills.  Come on, honey.  It is a SMALL place and if you have time to kill be hind the \"bar\" then you have time to look in to make sure I don't need anything.  I should have to ask.
Hostess - lack there of.  The entry is kind of cramped and unclear as to what you should / shouldn't do.  Is there a hostess? Isn't there?  Well, not really.  You wait, you're seated. The servers double as greeters / seaters.
No Bacon.  I'm sorry, Pork Belly is NOT bacon.  When I have cakes / flaps, I want me some bacon.

Would I come back & bring friends?  Yep.  Just not a big party of friends.  Maybe  6 tops."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for great food when I travel.  Finding a great breakfast always seems like the hardest meal to find.  I read some reviews here and decided that this place sounded exactly the place I dream about for breakfast.  It did not disappoint in any way.  

We had two adults and two children when we went here.  We were told 15-20 minutes for seating, but from the reviews I read, it seemed worth it.  Probably right there somewhere in that 15-20 minutes we got our table.  I ordered the Palookaville Benedict, my wife had the burrito, and our children both had the graham cracker waffle.  Then I told our waiter this was our first visit and asked if there was anything we should try.  I couldn't decide on one, so I added a side of root hash, pork belly, and sausage.  

I'm not sure how to explain everything to you, other than to say it's all good and I would not hesitate to get it all again.  

Would I eat here again?  Every weekend if I could!"}
{"text":"Great food! Generous portions which will throw you into a food coma. I ordered savory and my fiancee ordered sweet so it was a great place to share a brunch and get the best of both. 

A little small but definitely worth the wait. 

This area of Ohio city continues to improve and see good things in the future for being so close to downtown."}
{"text":"Had a delicious breakfast burrito. Proud to say I say I finished it all by myself! But you could definitely share it or take some home. Four stars because if your palate is sensitive, the burrito could be a bit too salty for you. I really enjoyed the root vegetable hash as well!! Great service and a great mixed crowd. Prices are reasonable and portion sizes are pretty generous. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite brunch spot!
The staff is extremely kind, the cooks are great, and the atmosphere is so cozy and quaint. As a Cleveland foodie and culinary graduate  who moved back from Scottsdale Arizona I'm constantly looking for little spots in the area. Jack flaps I will always remember you for the smore waffles and breakfast burrito that stole my heart"}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place for a while but always find myself in the city for dinner, not breakfast. Finally made it in and I was not disappointed. It's a small place so you'll want to get there early on a weekend if you're trying to avoid a long wait. I got seated at the bar and overheard the waitress explaining some things to the couple next to me. All of their ingredients are fresh, no pre-made mixtures. We're talking everything. Their ketchup, hot sauce, and cream cheese are even homemade with no artificial ingredients. I'm not one to be a stickler for that kind of thing, but it is very cool when it's done and done well. They also served local coffee and it was excellent. My fiancée got the breakfast burrito and I got the banh mi, which was a stretch for me. I'm pretty basic when it comes to breakfast choices. It was great. The sausage was unique and not greasy, which is a nice change from typical restaurant breakfast meat. The pickled vegis were also so good and the perfect sour touch to the sandwich. I ate mine sort of open-faced because the toasted bread was thick. Half way through our savory selections, we were regretting not trying a fresh pancake. So we ordered one for breakfast dessert. Like everything else, wonderful. Super fluffy, you could tell it was homemade. The syrup had a cinnamon bite to it, plus it's served with cinnamon butter. We loved everything. It's a short walk from Westside Market on a nice day, which is what we did afterward. I'd love to make a return visit!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the waitress was pleasant and helpful, and the hostess was friendly and efficient. I will definitely be back and plan to recommend Jack Flaps to others!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The staff was incredibly friendly, food was outstanding and service was quick. Can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I met here for lunch.  I looked on reviews for suggestions.  Interesting place.  Nice that they share tables as it is small. 
I ordered scrambled eggs as they don't do poached.  They came with root hash and sausage.  Toast was $1 extra.  Eggs were not scrambled; poured on grill cooked then flipped over.  I thought it looked like an omelette with nothing in it.  Sausage was a substitute for pork belly.  They ran out of pork belly. Surprisingly sausage was the best thing on the plate.  Root hash was 95 percent potatoes and not at all crispy.
Won't return.  Any restaurant can do better for half the price.
The waiter was attentive and nice.  I think his name was Joe.  Very nice waiter."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a great half-off-waffles-and-flapjacks happy hour between 11-1 (I think?) or is it 1 - 3? Their waffles are amazing. My favorite is the Happy Jack Waffle. I've also tried the Kimchi Waffle, the Banh Mi Sandwich, the Fat Elvis, and the Candied Jalapeno pancakes. None of it is bad, but I guess my favorites were Happy Jack and Fat Elvis. My friend probably liked the Banh Mi and the Kimchi waffle best though. It looks like the Kimchi/Galbi waffle isn't on their menu anymore though.

I cannot wait to go back to Cleveland to try some of their other waffles!... and get the Happy Jack again. :]"}
{"text":"I have a long list of places I've been dying to check out in Cleveland, and Jack Flaps was on it. Last Sunday my boyfriend and I were in the mood for brunch and decided to finally get over to Jack Flaps. So glad we did. We split the big f'ing burrito and the fat Elvis waffle. The burrito was amazing. Filled with eggs and the most delicious meat. I'm into savory breakfast so this was my favorite. The waffle was also great. It was smothered in Nutella, bananas, bacon, and whipped peanut butter. It sounds heavy, and it was very rich, but the waffle was so light and fluffy and all the toppings were perfectly complimentary. We also got a side of the Mexican coke glazed pork belly, which is the only thing I wasn't impressed with. You couldn't really taste the coke glaze, it was just okay. Overall it was a great experience, and we'll definitely be back. For all the late brunchers out there, they have happy hour from 1pm-3pm. All pancakes and waffles are 5 bucks during that time."}
{"text":"I had read some less than favorable reviews on Yelp about this place, particularly about the service. But I decided to try it anyway. Well, the reviews on the service were spot on. It took a hour for us to get our food. The place is very small and I saw people who came in after us get served faster. And it's pancakes!! Not difficult to make! The food was good but not worth the slow service. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot ever. Each dish has unique flavors. My favorite is the jalapeno pancake Pork belly bacon and the route hash. If I was still a Clevelander I will probably be here every other day"}
{"text":"Holy sh¡te. Best breakfast I've ever had. Please get the kimchi if available. Got the Real F'inn Breakfast. It was unreal good. The wait was tough. But besides that it was amazing.  Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for so long, and I'm glad I finally did. The space is quaint, clean, and very small, but it wasn't busy on a weekday morning. The service was good as well. 

There were so many interesting and creative items that caught my eye, but I decided to go with the lavender crunch waffle which did not disappoint. Although delicious, it was very rich and indulgent and I only finished a fourth of it before I called it quits. The toffee topping was an excellent idea, but I would suggest for the chef to break it into smaller sized pieces to sprinkle on so you can get a bit of crunch on each bite. The toffee was placed ontop of the waffle in large, bite sized pieces which were a little overwhelming and challenging to eat with the waffle. My only other complaint is that this place is pricey for what you receive. A single waffle goes for around $10, as do most of the other dishes. for someone who may want a little bit of all the breakfast staples (pancakes or waffles,
 eggs, hashbrowns, and meat) would be better off going to Denny's or any other local breakfast place.

 I suggest splitting a sweet item and a savory item between two people, because I wanted both and couldn't decide."}
{"text":"Super delicious food. Definitely a laid back and chill atmosphere which I love. I believe i counted the tables there and there's only 10, lol. But there's also a bar. The staff is super nice. Everyone that goes to Flap Jacks loves it and that why the line is always out the door on the weekend. So I recommend getting there a little earlier, if you don't want to wait as long. But regardless of the long line its definitely worth it. I always so in and put my name down on the list and head over to the Canopy next door to shop around and explore. If you come between 2-3pm before they close you get half off flapjacks and waffles, HELL YEAH!"}
{"text":"Very tasty pancakes, with lots of whipped cream and sauces and compotes.  It's a lot to eat; the pancakes come smothered in stuff, so you have to like that.  If not, it might be too much.  But it's Cleveland, and that's how Cleveland eats. The space is delightfully designed. The coffee comes in to-go cups for extra convenience."}
{"text":"Great place! The restaurant is pretty easy to find and we found metered parking right out front (our meter was broken -- score!). There was just one other table when we arrived around 1 pm on a Friday.  The waitress was very friendly and told us we were there during happy hour which meant that all waffles and pancakes were just $5. We split the buckwheat pancakes -- two large pancakes with a granola topping -- a breakfast burrito and a side of root veggies.  The pancakes were wonderful, not too sweet and with just the right amount of crunch from the granola.  The burrito was surprisingly spicy but not too spicy.  The root veggies were a nice addition.  We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Always looking for a good breakfast place. Came here with a few friends/colleagues on a Friday morning to celebrate a great year of work! It's a good addition to the Ohio City/Lorain area by Eric Williams (Momocho, happy dog, etc)

My first visit was a 3.5 but I will round up to four. Overall, the atmosphere is trendy, modern, a little grungy with huge photos of people getting smashed in the face with pancake mix or eggs. 

We tried a few things - lemon curd (probably the best, with the graham crackers and berries), the candied jalapeño, and the shrimp and grits. The pancakes were all very sweet- even the savory flavor. It's def not something I could eat regularly with my low tolerance for sweet things, but the lemon curd was done well. My candied jalapeño jacks were ok.. I love spicy and sweet combinations but the flavors didn't really come together for me for some reason. Was skeptical about the candied aspect of the jalapeños and if they're actually house made. 

The shrimp and grits... Buttery and creamy flavor with some good savory elements. Not sure if it should cost $10 but fair enough. They are definitely trying to hit a certain price point ($8-10) for two large pancakes (and you will most likely be full!). It's not going to be your average dive or diner. 

Overall, good first try. I may be back to try more."}
{"text":"We had been in Cleveland for the weekend, and were flying out early yesterday afternoon.  After suffering through a horrible breakfast at our hotel the day before, we decided to try this place.  Ultra casual, very \"hipster,\" and the food is wonderful!!!  I had the lemon curd flapjacks, my husband had the \"Real F-ing Breakfast Burrito\" (that is the name, exactly as shown on the menu!).  Both were fabulous!  Good coffee, great service.  Get there early.  How does anyone in Cleveland manage to keep their weight under 300 lbs?  We had three absolutely phenomenal meals in 48 hours!!!"}
{"text":"We go here at least 2-3 times a month for breakfast. Service is super friendly and fun. Sometimes a bit slow because of how busy they are. Baffles me that they only have 1 server on sometimes. But, nonetheless, there's great people working here! I do wish they had regular bacon instead of just pork belly. The food however is super creative and really flavorful! Great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"The menu and atmosphere are so unique and decadent. I ordered their carrot cake waffle which is famous, and wow was it scrumptious! No syrup needed just use their cinnamon butter and it's like heaven sliding off your fork and into your mouth. It's s small place, maybe 7 tables total, but it has a calming and inviting atmosphere. Not too loud, the sound barriers are perfect. Because of its size it does get quite busy, there can be a line at times so plan accordingly. Overall price, quality of food and quantity of good gave this place 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Solid. Come early to beat the rush. Staff is friendly and courteous. 

Street parking is pretty easy."}
{"text":"Came here with my fiancé. Loved the atmosphere. Good coffee. Graham Cracker waffles are a treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. Had the breakfast burrito, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend about a week ago and it was absolutely amazing. Depending on when you go, there might be a bit of a wait, but it's definitely it is definitely worth it. Our waiter was very polite and friendly, as well as attentive making sure he was checking in. The food was delicious! I had the tiramisu pancakes and my boyfriend have a savory dish with waffles, chorizo and eggs.

Divine. Can't wait until we go again."}
{"text":"I have been going to jackflaps  with my girlfrend on saturdays for sometime. We have aways had good food and service. One day at West Shore Wines we even met the owner, a nice guy! However, today for the first time I took my husband. We did not even get waited on for almost a half hour. The waitress would not even acknowledge us! i finally asked the nice guy, Brian, if he could take our order (he was cleaning tables) and he did. They were not busy (4 tables total including ours) Not a single table ate together, including my husband and I. Everything came out one meal at a time! My pancakes were so dry! The table behind us asked to see a manager, to which Brian replyed, they didnt have one there! This is not acceptable, the price for breakfast warrants much better treatment! On a positive note, thank you Brian for at least taking care of us!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot after just one visit. Cool place, amazingly tasty food, and great service - everything you can want in a restaurant. I'm normally the type that says breakfast can't really be that much different from one place to the next but this place has certainly changed my mind on that. 

My gf and I ordered the pancakes with the lemon sauce and the breakfast banh mi per the recommendations from our waitress. We also ordered a side of bacon which just so happened to be thick sliced pork belly in a yummy glaze - they tasted like a BBQ rib minus the sauce. So. Good. The pancakes were of a perfect batter that was light and cooked so the outside had a nice crispness to it. And the lemon sauce was probably made with a mascarpone and lemon zest which had a sweetness but it wasn't overpowering. It was incredibly well balanced. The banh mi was on a delicious baguette and had sausage and a perfectly cooked sunny-side up egg on top. 

Overall, this was one of the best breakfasts I've ever eaten anywhere. Two thumbs WAY up for this spot for my first visit. I will DEFINiTELY be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounding up because I think that might be a matter of taste. They have a VERY small space, so it works best to go as a duo and sit at the bar rather than as a larger group. They also seem to have significantly shorter wait times in the afternoon.

Food was uneven, but I think that was more my taste than an objective problem. The s'mores waffle had only the thinnest bit of Nutella sauce on it, which was disappointing to me. I solved this problem with maple syrup, and only later saw another gentlemen just order extra Nutella sauce. What genius! It does need a bit more liquid, so ORDER THE EXTEA NUTELLA. Honestly, I think this might have been a five star meal if I'd just done that.

The other five star piece of our meal was the Vietnamese sausage. It was flavorful and perfectly cooked. The root veggie hash was a bit bland for my tastes. My sister got the tiramisu pancakes and seemed happy. The cakes themselves were excellently executed. I would have wanted significantly more topping, but again I think that's a person preference issue.

Overall, a solid brunch spot, although you may have to order some extra topping on the breakfast items depending on your preferences."}
{"text":"The service was great overall. I enjoyed my food (basic: two eggs, toasts, sausage, and hash). My sister had the banh mi and the vegetable root hash. Personally, the sausage was too salty for my liking besides this everything else tasted amazing, especially the vegetable root hash. Also, they have homemade hot sauce, it was in a cute little bottle but was in fact hot sauce (spicy). I will be returning for their pancakes!"}
{"text":"I know this is a little blasphemous to say, especially considering the popularity of this restaurant, but I thought the pancakes were dry. I've been to both the Ohio City and the downtown locations and thought the same thing both times. It's a nice place with good brunch options otherwise."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is great.  Was shocked it wasn't more crowded on a Saturday morning.  My son and I got there shortly after 9:00am and were seated right away.  My son had the graham cracker waffle with Nutella and really liked it.

I had the S.O.S. with two eggs added on the advice of my server.  I'm a breakfast guy and without a doubt this is the best breakfast I have ever had.  I wish my dad was still alive as he would have really enjoyed this dish.  Reminded me of days gone by, when times were tougher.  

Server told me the S.O.S. is seasonal because not enough people order it.  Cleveland you are missing out, break out of your routine and get to this place."}
{"text":"Yum, Jack Flaps was always a great option for breakfast food. The servers are also always so friendly.

Of course, I made it a point to always come at their happy hour from 1pm - 3pm to take advantage of the $5 jackflaps and waffles. Seriously cannot beat that price, and you get a ton of delicious food. My personal favorite is the lemon curd!

Also, if you're like me and tend to get a little overwhelmed by too much sweet food at a time, definitely get some of the savory sides to balance it out. It helps that at the happy hour pricing, you can easily get sides to share and still be spending less than at other places. I would recommend the root veggie hash."}
{"text":"Let's paint the setting- tiny restaurant. Lots of natural light. High ceilings. Trendy pictures of the owners (I'm guessing they're the owners) getting food dumped on their faces. I like a sense of humor. Overall, the space feels comfortable but trendy. I couldn't help but think, \"am I in Cleveland right now?\"

Let's talk food! You really can't go wrong with Pancakes and waffles. I had gotten the lemon waffle, which was melt in your mouth delicious. I enjoyed that it wasn't overly sweet. My companion had gotten the old school special, eggs with root veggie hash and pork belly... Ironically the special wasn't really all that special. Kind of plain. Coffees are served in paper to-go cups, which seemed convenient but wasteful."}
{"text":"The first time I attempted to sneak in for breakfast, the line extended out the door and the wait was beyond my threshold for patience. The second time however, I would not be denied, arriving before they opened and was the first person through the door. This place is small, seating perhaps only 15 people, but don't let that fool you, because the food is simply exceptional and uniquely defined. 

I decided on the Tiramisu pancakes with a side of cinnamon grits, and both were delightful!"}
{"text":"This place was just OK for me. The place has a cute vibe to it, I liked it. I did think the food was underwhelming. I ordered the lemon curd pancakes, and just something about them was unenjoyable to me. I think it has too many flavor ideas that don't work well for my palate. I ate just enough until I really couldn't anymore. Portions are generous and filling. Luckily I ordered a side of eggs which were delicious and perfectly cooked. The potato/veggie hash also seems delicious.

 I would like to come back here again and try something else on the menu such as the hash and maybe selecting a different pancake.

Our server was friendly and thoroughly answered any questions we had prior to ordering. They have a happy hour, 1-3pm where the pancakes and waffles are $5."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Food not impressive. Also very crowded. Waitress visited our table to get drinks, take order, drop off food and then check. Took forever in between each. Won't come here again."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland definitely give this place a try. The staff was very friendly and even recommended some places to visit during my stay. The coffee was really good. They have this mild hot sauce that is made there and it's so tasty. i enjoyed the: 

BREAKFAST BÁNH MÌ
Baguette | breakfast kimchi | cilantro | cucumber | everything-bagel-cream-cheese | fried egg."}
{"text":"the food was awesome and i did take pictures with my phone even though they request no cell phone usage inside unless you hashtag pictures of the food, which i haven't done.

my 4yo got pancakes, which were the size of manhole covers, and he crushed them!
my wife got the banh mi benedict which she raved about
i opted for the beer cheese omelette, which was the bomb!

the root vegetable hash was a nice surprise too, instead of the standard potato hash.

if you're looking for a breakfast place to eat in Cleveland that's reasonable with great food and you're into people watching in the 5th Street Arcade, look no further than Jack Flaps"}
{"text":"Delicious, inviting, and cozy. Best way that I can describe this little breakfast spot. Ordered the winter jam waffle and Vietnamese sausage and I was scraping my plate!! Great place for good breakfast eats. Be prepared to wait because this is a SMALL place. I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Our food was amazing!  Get the pork belly bacon, you won't regret it :) The portion sizes are good here and everything we tried was great.  I also love that they keep warm coffee for anyone coming in off the street that needs it, no questions asked."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place. Very original take on the standard pancakes and eggs. I had the Real fucking breakfast burrito, it was outstanding. Try it with the house made hot sauce. Really unique, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A hipster pancake place! I enjoyed the buck buck wheat, though the service took a while. Prices weren't bad, and the surrounding neighborhood played into the whole hipster vibe."}
{"text":"There's something off about this place. Maybe it's the food, the service, or the atmosphere. Or all of the above. 

My fiancé and I just moved to Cleveland and we were excited to find this new (to us) breakfast place by where we live. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with our experience at Jack Flaps. 

It started when we placed our name down for a table, they said it was a 25-30 minute wait. Which is fine, we were really looking forward to trying this place out! By the time our name was called, another couple with the same name walked up and was about to take our table. The hostess looked at us as if we never walked through the door before. Then a few minutes later the hostess came to our table and asked for our drink order; we ordered a water and a coffee. Then a waitress walked over and asked to take our drink order again! Lack of communication and team work at this restaurant. When our drinks were brought to the table, the water had something in it and tasted funny, and the coffee tasted watered down. 

When it was time for us to order our food, our waitress was very nice. We ordered the breakfast burrito and the \"old standard\" with scrambled eggs (without cheese), hash, and sausage. The waitress brought out our food in a timely manner. But unfortunately, the breakfast burrito was not even warm, it was cold, and had barely anything inside. It was all tortilla. And then there was the Old Standard; the whole dish was barely warm, the hash was had no taste to it, the eggs were NOT scrambled AND had cheese on it! Again, the waitress was nice enough to bring us another side of \"scrambled\" eggs but it was incredibly salty. 

Cleveland Scene Magazine described it as \"funky.\" Yeah, the atmosphere was very funky, but not in the best way. The floor had no flow and looked all over the place. The hallway between the hostess stand and the door, and the walk way between tables were too small and not proportionate at all! Tables were too big for the space."}
{"text":"I came to jackflaps on a Sunday morning for brunch. The place was absolutely packed, but the hosts here are smart; they overestimate the time it takes to get in. They told us 35 minutes, and we waited for about 15 and were seated.

I ordered a pumpkin pancake dish, and I liked the food a lot. The pancakes themselves were rich, and the syrup complimented the pumpkin flavor well. The pancakes themselves could have used a bit more flavor, but they were satisfying. 

I think the most disappointing thing about this restaurant is that as a vegetarian, some of the options were frustrating. I wanted the only vegetarian lunch item on the menu, but I noted that the creme fraiche had bacon. There was no substitute for it, and that was frustrating; most restaurants have at least one lunch item that doesn't have meat, and I was bummed.

Overall, though, the food was delicious, the servers were wonderful, and the environment is stellar."}
{"text":"I came here inadvertently because I didn't want to wait at another restaurant and this place looked promising. I must say I think I made the right choice for breakfast!

I had the Creamsicle Jackflaps which were amazing. I've never had orange pancakes before and I was a little skeptical but decided to give it a try and I was impressed! The friend I was with had the Fat Elvis and he loved it. The atmosphere was fun and modern and the service was absolutely phenomenal.  I would love to come back and try something from the savory side of the menu!"}
{"text":"Two words: Tiramisu pancakes. I've also had the graham cracker waffle which was equally amazing. My only advice is to get here early because seating is very limited. My fiancé had the \"breakfast banh mi\" and did not like it. Next on my list to try is the lemon curd jackflap and the raspberry crisp waffle!"}
{"text":"It was so hard to order because everything looked so good!  I ended up with a bacon bleu cheese omelet with a side of corned beef hash on the side. Might have to get one of their colossal pancakes to go for later!"}
{"text":"We came for a savory breakfast as we were going to the market after to grab a pastry. I ordered the burrito, and it was amazing. The meat had a delightful flavor and was well mixed with the other ingredients. My 2 friends got the egg and chorizo gravy with corn bread which was also very good, but I would argue the burrito was better. Both were extremely flavorful and didn't leave us feeling too greasy after. The service was awesome as they were very prompt to fill up our coffee and water many times. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast! Everything is so good. Weekends it gets a little crazy so get there early or dont have a large group"}
{"text":"If you are like me and look at the menu before trying someplace new...you know what you're in for. This place is a great addition. No, you won't find a list of egg dishes or a variety of options. If you go to a place called Jack Flaps you can guess it has a featured item. I personally wasn't disappointed.

We came. We sat at the bar. We ordered. The staff was friendly and super helpful. Sure it's a smaller place but there are plenty of spots and we were out of there in under an hour.

I started with a cup of coffee. They even brought me cinnamon to add to it. Bonus pts! My cup wasn't empty once. And they serve in to-go cups so you can take it on whatever journey you are headed on next. We then ordered the Lemon Curd Flaps for me and the Graham Cracker for him with a side of bacon. The bacon was for sure melt in your mouth and disappeared. The portion sizes are massive! If you bring the kids I'm sure they could share a plate. The side of butter was delicious. We devoured our meals and are plotting our next choices. You do have some alternatives to pick from but overall it's a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"2nd time visiting and still no complaints! This past visit we had the breakfast burrito & the garbage plate.. both were ridiculously good (see pics!) and the first time we came we had the burrito and some \"flaps\" with a chocolate sauce (also great). The place is on the smaller side and can easily get filled quickly even during the week - get there early but definitely go!"}
{"text":"Jack Flaps is my favorite breakfast stop. End of story. We alway have Tory for our server. What a breath of fresh air. She is as professional as the breakfasts are good. I highly recommend the vietnames patties, , But have yet to be disappointed with any item on the menu.  My only warning is if you like extra crispy bacon you must order it that way. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A very creative menu of breakfast treats. We really enjoyed the Crab Benedict and the special mint flapjacks. The bacon was different a bit sweeter than most and a nice alternative. The coffee could use some work unfortunately. Because this is such a clever place it is crowded. Leave plenty of time!"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent visitor and lover of Jack Flaps but haven't been in a while because the wait can be so long. But alas I woke up early to get in and get some delicious food. 

I was disappointed in almost every aspect of my experience. The service was seriously lacking as in nonexistent because we never saw our sever & I had to beg for coffee . Our food was also nonexistent as we waited over 50 minutes to get it as other tables who came after us all received food. And lastly the communication was nonexistent as no one ever communicated why the food was mysteriously absent. I was told when asked that it was going in order and not until the people who sat next to us 30 minutes after us and got food was I told that a waffle machine was broken... 

I usually don't like to complain and I love small places and breakfast. But this whole experience has made me question if I'll come back especially if I'm hungry. 

The climax is the food did come out! But the temp was tepid and the mood was already ruined."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito is awesome. Last time I had the Banh Mi breakfast sandwich, which wasn't that great. A little disappointing. Though my friends all enjoyed what they got, including a salmon dish I tried which was very good. Service was great."}
{"text":"One of my biggest fears migrating from the West Coast was not having ten awesome brunch spots spanning the hipster intensity scale within a two-mile radius. At any given time. Unfortunately Jack Flaps isn't within that range of my new home, but it fits the bill of wooden-tabled, bearded-waiter, jam-packed Sunday morning local ritual.

The wait time of 30 minutes to be seated (for 4) wasn't that bad, but after we were seated and had ordered the food seemed to take forever and five minutes to emerge. Let's backtrack for a moment though. Our waiter, Joel, luckily was really chipper and helpful, also dropping the useful tidbit that we had arrived during Happy Hour and all Jack Flaps (pancakes) and Waffles were $5. Sold we were. 

I chose the Sweet Thai Curry Waffle and after the above-noted wait, it arrived with my side of (two) Vietnamese-style Sausage Patties. Our waiter once again proved his worth his weight in waffles when he warned me about the spicy Thai chilies topping the house-made cream. I carefully removed them so I don't know how hot they actually are, but I pass along the message to eat at your own risk. The Waffle was just the right texture and thickness for lunch-time gratification, and the curried peaches bring a unique aromatic twist to American brunch. It becomes a little overpowering the more you get of it, at which point I had to cut a few pieces of Sausage (which took forever to emerge despite being two little patties) to counter the tangy sauce. I enjoyed the Sausage Patties, but not as much as the Thai Waffle. Neither of these are really for the unadventurous palate, yet I appreciated the exotic experimentation.

I was thoroughly stuffed after finishing both my plates - I'm not a fan of soggy waffles and I didn't want to waste anything. The menu seems to rotate seasonally and based on the cooks' whims since I didn't see my order on the current online menu. Obviously this warrants return trips for a $10 (I kid you not) brunch."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday around 10:15am. Was sat in 10 minutes. The place is small, so I expected to be waiting much longer. I ordered the fat Elvis waffle, my girlfriend had the candied jalapeño flapjacks. Both were delicious and a hearty plate of food. The flavors blended really well together. The waffle was definitely better than the flapjacks in my opinion. Customers next to me got the breakfast burrito which looked amazing, will definitely be back to try it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast there today! Kitchen snafu with my order so I got something different than expected but it was worth it. I highly recommend the Bacon and Bleu Cheese omelette."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast at Jack Flaps on my way out of Cleveland. The staff was very helpful and polite and the food was quite impressive."}
{"text":"(*This review is based on a to-go order) 

I'm a huge fan of innovative breakfast/brunch restaurants, and applaud the thought put into their menu. Saturday, 2:20pm, I called in a take out order; they were ready in 10 minutes and still hot after I paid. Note: although purchased during their happy hour, I paid full price. Dine in only pricing!  

Pig and the Pear:  This is a good compromise if you want something off the sweet menu without a cavity, but the waffle was dry. There were perfect sweet-savory bites when I had a little taste of all the flavors, but only enough topping for 1/2 the waffle. Although that 1/2 was tasty, bacon was missing throughout (I tasted it in 2 bites.), disappointing.  I asked on the phone and in person for butter and syrup (def. needed), irritated that it was forgotten. 

Lemon curd pancakes:  delicious. Lemon topping is a little too tart on it's own, but each bite with the pancake, berries and topping is heaven. Even so, they were so sweet could only handle 4 bites at a time.  Still have an entire pancake left to tackle! 

All in all, good enough that I'll be back to try other menu options, but only during happy hour. Little pricey for a gamble."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly - no complaints here.  But when it came to the food, that was a different story.

My girlfriend got the original jack flaps and I got the jalapeño variety.  A couple of bites in and we were both taken aback because of how dry they were compared to the rave reviews we'd read.  Also the coke-glazed pork belly was nothing to write home about.  I would estimate my order was about 85-90% fat.

We really wanted to like this place, but were pretty disappointed.  Let's also not forget the price: 1 coffee, 2 orders of jack flaps, 2 orders of bacon - $27 before tip.  We will not be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Very good food, but make sure if you want your food gluten free or vegan you need to specify! The menu states (V/GF) on many items but probably should say VA and GFA. Staff was very accommodating when our food came and was not GF. They were quick to replace our items and they were delicious! We had the tiramisu pancakes and berry waffle with a side of pork belly. Very cool atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"After a couple people recommended Jack Flaps to me I decided I should perhaps try it, if only to fit in.  Actually, I'm a fan of the breakfast foods so I was a bit excited to try it.  When I first arrived the restaurant wasn't super busy, which was good because I could see how seating could get a bit tight during a busy period.  Next I noticed that the seating arrangement was reminiscent of a high school cafeteria.  By that I mean that, while single tables did exist, there were several long tables that, I suppose, were meant to be shared.  Not surprisingly, the single tables were all occupied so when my friend arrived we sat at one of the communal tables.  As we ate, the group sharing the table left and a new group took the place.  I totally admit this is personal opinion, but I'm not enthusiastic about the table sharing.

As for the food, it was good.  I had the s'mores waffles, which were unique and tasty.  The coffee was just ordinary diner coffee.  I guess I just felt that in a city where there are so many good options, there's no reason to settle for OK, or good.  I'd definitely recommend trying Jack Flaps, because so many people do like it.  It just wasn't 100% my cup of tea.  And I'm not waffling."}
{"text":"Interesting and fun menu items, okay service. There will be a long wait if you go at, you know, breakfast times..."}
{"text":"Simply need it to live when in Cleveland - the Frittata is excellent but the most amazing thing on menu is their Benedicto Mexicano. If the wait staff  just smiled once in a while"}
{"text":"Breakfast there this AM was awesome! The pancakes were hands down the best we have ever had. The other menu selections (we eyed them as they went past us) also look great. We recommend this highly! We are visiting from NY and we were so lucky to have found Jack Flaps!"}
{"text":"We ordered the lemon curd flapjacks and split it thank goodness because the portion is huge. But it was very very good the lemon curd with the fresh fruit blended very well together. Coffee was standard and we did order a side of the brown sugar pork belly and I personally would rather have just plain old bacon. But our waitress was very nice and if we came back I would be interested in grabbing breakfast here again. We did want to try the carrot cake waffles but it was seasonal item however the Lemon Curd flapjacks were exceptional!"}
{"text":"Very nice, locally owned restaurant. Very refreshing to find Gluten Free options on a breakfast menu. The potato root hash is wonderful, and the coffee was excellent. I wish they offered real maple syrup for the pancakes."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast in town. My parents were in town for the weekend and I took them there.  I've never seen my parents so happy about a breakfast after they left.   Now my parents want to go there every time they're in town"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and even better food. The sides were so cheap, they almost beg to be bought with an entree. Highly recommend. 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"Cute stop on our way to New York! Food was so tasty and all the ingredients were top notch. I had the Buckwheat pancake made gluten free with a side of eggs; the hubs had The Standard with hash.... empty plates all around! Be prepared to wait in line during peak times as it is a very small dining are."}
{"text":"Small, trendy place in Ohio City. Relatively good food. I got the Benedicto Mexicano and my kiddo got the original buttermilk pancakes with a side of brown sugar pork belly. Immediate take after sampling our fare? Food was good (not great), but a bit pricey... especially the pancakes, which I don't find to be anything special. They just top it with some \"fancy\" toppings and charge nearly $10 or more. They do have some other interesting items on the menu I'd like to try, so will likely be back."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars for at least attempting creativity in their menu.  The food was such a miss I couldn't believe it.  I got the breakfast burrito and my fiance got the breakfast plate with scrambled eggs, bacon, and \"hash\".  

First, this \"hash\" which was not only half of her plate but stuffed inside my burrito was some sort of frozen mix that had such an awful seasoning to it, it ruined my meal, for her it was just something she took one bite of and tossed aside.

Second, her bacon was not bacon.  It was the fattiest under cooked pork belly and it seemed to be seasoned with cinnamon.  Just insulting really.

Third, even if I liked the \"hash\" in my burrito it was still inedible because the quality of the ingredients were so bad, ESPECIALLY the meat which was dry and lacking any sort of flavor.  

F#$@ this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious shrimp and grits.   Also enjoyed the root vegetable hash.   This alone is a great reason to visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"We attempted to come to Jack Flaps a few months ago and failed miserably. I believe it was a Saturday morning, sometime around 10:30. We couldn't even get in the door. We aborted the mission and made alternate plans. Needless to say, when the opportunity arrived for us to attempt a reboot of our mission - this time, a Tuesday, 9-ish - we jumped at it.

We parked in the lot just down the street, you know the one, it has a massive crater lake in it? Anyway, we were greeted with a smile and \"sit where you'd like\" and so began our odyssey. The place was empty except for two guys having what seemed like a business meeting. Just in case you haven't been here, let me summarize a few things that others have already mentioned:

1. It's small. Very, very small. There's a bar with a handful of seats and a couple of tables in the dining area, but once there are about 20 people inside, you're not likely to find a spot. Come early and come during the week.

2. The menu isn't huge and it's conveniently split into sweet & savory sides. It's worth noting that most of the eats come from the former category. Nearly an entire page is dedicated to waffles/pancakes/French toast covered with dessert-y stuff. Don't worry, though. The savory options all sound fantastic.

3. It's owned by the same folks behind some pretty damn good Cleveland-area dining gems including Momocho, El Carnicero and Happy Dog, so don't be concerned that it won't be good. It is.

4. The coffee is damn good. 

Overall, our visit was great. Friendly service, coffees always topped off (and filled before we left) and the food was fresh, belly filling and flavorful. So if we liked it so much, why only 4 stars? Well, because I'm a picky son of a bitch, that's why.

My wife ordered the seasonal French toast, er, I mean, Eggy Bread and while tasty and plentiful, it just didn't live up to the name - Punkin Bread. The only thing punkin about it were the pepitas on the top. We couldn't taste any pumpkin pie spices at all. I was pleased that it wasn't cloyingly sweet, however, and the slices of buttery brioche bread were the size of a catcher's mitt. Another slight misstep, they didn't let the bread soak in the eggs long enough. Just not enough \"eggy\" in the bread.

I ordered the Real Effin Breakfast Burrito. A baby-sized gut bomb on a plate.  I rarely eat before lunch, but when I do it has to be meat-based. It was very, very good. The flavors were all on point - the spices on the ridiculously tender adobo braised beef, the perfect level of heat, the smokiness from the fresh tomato salsa -  yeah, I know. It was a bit light on the eggs, though and could have used more crema as all that tortilla made things a bit dry.

So there you have it. Jack Flaps is a delicious little breakfast nook tucked away in Ohio City (they've got a location downtown in The Arcade, too) that serves some sinfully tasty, fresh, and innovative dishes. Skip the chains and support your locals as often as you can. Places like this need you to survive."}
{"text":"Yelped this place Thursday night. So glad I did. Enjoyed a late breakfast during their $5 happy hour. Chose the winter jam waffle which was delicious and not too sweet! The root vegetable hash was so good, I'm thankful for the other reviews of it, otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it. Missed the Mexican Coke pork belly bacon, a friend mentioned it after I had already left. Service was fast, food was delicious. If I find myself back in Cleveland, I'll definitely be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place has some tasty food! Went on a Saturday at 9am and got a seat no prob. Had the SOS which was huge and I loved it, def 2 meals will come from that. Tried the Cracker Jack pancakes. So good, very crunchy. You must like crunch (like captain crunch) if you get this. Even came with a stick on tattoo as a prize. Will be back for sure! Yum!"}
{"text":"My only major critique of Jack Flaps is the fact that they weren't open on a holiday when I really, really, REALLY wanted their breakfast. So I guess I don't really have anything to truly complain about. Cleveland has no shortage of great breakfast places but there is an exception here for a great place that is worth checking out! Great service, too!"}
{"text":"Even smaller than I realized but well worth any wait. We were able to get 4 seats at the bar right away at about 12:30 on Saturday. We all enjoyed the excellent coffee and ordered something different. Between the four of us we tried the Benedict, burrito, bahn mi, and lemon curd pancakes. The service was excellent and our food came out really quick. The burrito and the pancakes were definitely with winners with tons of flavor. The burrito was even better covered in their excellent hot sauce. The bahn mi was the least favorite, while flavorful the bread lacked the typical crispy texture of a baguette and the sandwich was a bit light on the kimchi. Overall, we were super impressed. Make sure you try a little bit of each sweet and savory."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Friend had the burrito. I sampled a small piece. Noticed the sauce on top was cold -- just out of the fridge. Otherwise, pretty delicious. I had the GF pancakes with lemon curd and berry topping. Those toppings were also cold, and the GF pancakes tasted, well...gluten free. I devoured them because I was very hungry, but I'd opt for a different choice next time. Coffee was ok. Giving 4 stars because I feel like they have more to offer, and I'll try them again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I take my brunch very seriously, so whenever I venture to a new spot I'm pretty damn wary. I mean after all, my whole week will be ruined if my Sunday brunch turns out to be a bust. I have to admit though after reading the reviews and scoping out the scene on Yelp I wasn't too concerned about whether or not Jack Flaps was going to be a winner. 

I rolled in around 9:30 fully anticipating a long wait. I dont know if it's because there was a Browns game or what but they weren't packed at all. Obviously I was thrilled because it meant I was one step closer to sweet brunch bliss. 

I got a coffee to start and though it was a decent cup of Joe I was a little disappointed it was served in a to-go cup. This kind of made me feel like maybe they wanted me to rush out of there. 

I proceeded to pretend to look at the menu (I actually had the thing basically memorized at this point from how many times I had looked at it during my downtime at work.) I decided to go with the Nooks and Crannies waffle. I dont know what about this jumped out at me but the chèvre cheese paired with the peach chutney just sounded too good to pass up. Queue the crazy bliss-bomb this thing was incredible. Not only did it come out from the kitchen pretty quickly, it was so moist and delicious and sweet, and savory, and just everything anyone could ever want in a waffle. Is it legal to marry a waffle? If it is I totally call dibs on the Nooks and Crannies. 

Do yourself a favor and get to Jack Flaps. IHOP's got nothin on these guys."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to order some vegan pancakes! Was super excited until we got home and the pancakes were SO raw that they were still leaking batter out of them! We called to complain and inform them of the incident and they said, \"Thanks,\" and hung up on us! Not even an apology or our money back! Will NEVER be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the place , I did . They were grossly under staffed and while I recognize that to be the case the service was so sub par that it was just a lost cause. From the point where this young lady decided she couldn't be arsed to try pronounce my name (2 syllables) to an absolute lack of common courtesy telling me where I'd be seated 'you're just one so sit at the bar' left me with a strong desire to walk out. The lady behind the counter with bright pink hair was nicer but the bar was so low I would have been surprised if she managed to crawl beneath it. I ordered a veggie burrito which I must say lacked any flavor But of the front of the house was so poorly staffed I doubt the kitchen was any different. While it have a really good presentation but as mentioned earlier it was sorely lacking in flavor.

I had to ask for sugar with my tea which really isn't a big deal normally, however given how stellar the service had been I was hoping for some saving grace. Anyway , no one even bothered to ask if I needed any condiments or if the food was even ok. I truly can't blame them for they were running around clearly at least two down. Yet that's not my problem is it, it's not like the prices reflected the lack of service , common social graces, or a that it was even communicated that they were short staffed. In all fairness the girl behind the counter with the bright pink hair really did try but there was no way she could've managed to salvage anything running all around the place.

Unless something majorly changes with the staffing and service you can get a better tasting 15$ burrito elsewhere . Avoid unless starving."}
{"text":"Great little place, will be back for sure!  Try the F'en burrito, awesome.  Great homemade hot sauce too!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love!  Service was awesome. Food was delicious. We split the breakfast burrito and the graham waffle. That was one bomb ass burrito!!! Fantastic! It was a little too spicy for my tender-mouthed girlfriend, so she ordered some toast to tame it down. The white toast was cut thick, crisp-tender and spread with cinnamon butter. So good. Great brunch spot. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place, very good and creative menu. Our server Alexandra knew her stuff. Be prepare to wait for a table and then share it... nice experience."}
{"text":"I came into the Cleveland Flap Jacks on a typical Saturday morning when I had to wait 45 minutes to be seated but that didn't bother me. What bothered me is that once we were finally seated and put in our orders we sat around for an additional 55 minutes. How long could it possibly take to make some pancakes... #bullshit defiantly never coming back. -Ryan pickett"}
{"text":"Tired of the same old breakfast food.....look no more. Awesome menu with non traditional breakfast fare. This place rocks, great food, friendly service, will for sure be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Need I say anything, Jack Flaps rocks. Try the Luncheonette in the Old Arcade too."}
{"text":"If I could start every day with a meal from Jack Flaps, I would.  (I'd also be dead in 3 weeks, but that's just a minor detail.)  

There's something to be said about consistency in breakfast: regular dishes like scrambled eggs with toast and regular pancakes are mainstays for a reason.  But, every now and again, it's worthwhile to flip those notions on their heads.  Jack Flaps is the place where those notions get flipped. 

Simple breakfast staples get a lot of extra attention at this restaurant.  Everything is taken just to a level of overindulgence, but pulls back just a little to remain accessible and familiar.    

I got the \"Real F-ing Breakfast Burrito.\"  It was a big portion, but I was up for the commitment.  All of the components, from the beef filling and eggs to the crema and salsa on top were delicious. I also asked for some of their hot sauce, which was so good that I brought a bottle home.  ($2 well worth it.)

The absolute star was the mexican coke pork belly.  The only mistake I made in ordering the pork belly was sharing with the other people at the table. (Lesson learned.)  

Others at my table ordered the Fat Elvis, (waffles with peanut butter, bananas, and candied bacon), the Vietnamese-Style sausage patties (SO GOOD), creamsickle Jack Flaps, and the PB&J Eggy bread.  

We all left happy and stuffed.  It's the perfect way to start your day if your immediate post-breakfast plans include a nap."}
{"text":"I have no words other than this is the best meal we have had since moving back to Ohio last Summer. Hubby had the big f-ing burrito and I had the Croque Madam. OMG.  We are so excited to good back to try everything.  To Ashley in her Yelp review and mentioned \"cheaper waffles at Denny's\"-there is no comparison-an insult to the owners of this place."}
{"text":"I had the regular buttermilk pancakes.  They have got to be the best pancakes ever. Don't forget to order the house butter with cinnamon. When ordering the hash do not confuse these with hash browns. They are potatoes with a special taste."}
{"text":"The food was sold and the portions were huge, I recommend getting something from both the savory and sweet sections and splitting with a friend/spouse. You'll definitely leave Jack Flaps satisfied."}
{"text":"The lemon curd pancakes and breakfast burrito made up one of the best breakfasts we've had in a very long time.  I think the contrasts between them also made it more fun since the pancakes were sweet/sumptuous and the burrito was smoky/savory.  On top of all that, the service was top notch.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"For now I'm coming through with a 4-star review for Jack Flaps. Why? Well, I was smart enough to come here for a lunch meeting while on a cleanse. And by \"smart\" I mean really dumb. So I wasn't able to taste what really represents this resto.

Jack Flaps is known for over-the-top and uniquely indulgent brunch-y delights. I was drooling over at least 5 menu items, including what looked like a life-changing breakfast burrito. But alas, I had to choose the traditional breakfast plate of two eggs (any way), meat and a side. Not that it was bad, but when you're tempted with hotdog waffles complete with \"everything bagel\" cream cheese?! I mean... eggs smeggs. 

I suppose I can share that my eggs were perfectly prepared how I asked: over easy. And the nibblet of homemade sausage patty I tried was divine. Oh, and the tiny spoonful of the glorious bowl of grits I had was also impressive. I know--I don't know why I punished myself by coming here when I couldn't have much more than the egg whites. 

Our lunch meeting was a 1PM and although the restaurant was bustling with people, our service was spot-on. Nothing over the top, just courteous, quick and efficient. 

As soon as I'm off this cleanse I'm coming back for that burrito. And those waffles. I'm already counting down the days."}
{"text":"This place makes a great breakfast. Some must gets are the graham cracker s'mores  waffle, the bahm mi sandwhich, and if you like lox the deviled egg. The only thing that should be changed is to get rid of the to go cups for coffee and get some coffee mugs."}
{"text":"Had brunch here with some friends recently. I had been here years before and it didn't leave a strong impression one way or the other. I'm glad I returned because my pancakes were delicious!  They have a variety of decadent pancakes and waffles.  I ate every last bite of a peanut butter and jelly with nutella combo. The key to going here is to make sure you don't eat much beforehand and to be in a mood for a dessert/breakfast.   They have a few savory options as well and some other breakfast staples if you're looking for something more traditional. There isn't a lot of seating so expect to wait for a table.  I am looking forward to going back the next time I have a craving for a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"Best place to get breakfast! Everything Home made and the portions are great and presentation is spot on. Try one of their burritos omg ! Life !"}
{"text":"Had Brunch here today, 5 star overall. Good food great service!

Best thing? - COFFEE! Their coffee is REALLY good. 

1.) Bun Mi - really good, kimchi gives it a kick, sauce on the sides was amazing.
2.) PB&J French Toast- Large cuts of toast, delicious overall!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast during the week. Food was delicious. My brother and I split the honey and brie pancakes, the bah mi benedict, poutine and corned beef hash. Yes, that was a lot of food we didn't finish, but it was very good! The poutine didn't have much cheese curd so it lacked balance, but still worth trying. 

The server was very nice but never cleared our plates--and with the amount of food we had, there were many."}
{"text":"This morning I went out to jack flaps for brunch with a couple of friends.  I guess they weren't planning on being as busy as they were for a Monday.  I can only assume they were short staffed. The menu is limited but we got veggie burritos and the lemon curd pancakes.  But were very good.  I felt for our waiter because he doing everything and had several larger groups.  I always have a soft spots for over worked wait staff.  Overall it's a cute place, very small, and I can only imagine how busy they would be on a weekend.  Best park was the coffee it was fresh and my mug was always full!"}
{"text":"Walked into Jack Flaps with decent hopes given the cozy and vibrant atmosphere and fairly adventurous menu.  Unfortunately, the food didn't meet the ambitiousness of those elements, but I think the restaurant still has a lot of potential.  

My Cracker-Jackflaps featured a crunchy texture due to the corn nuts mixed into the batter and nut toppings, but the salted caramel sauce was only minimally present and, with the corn nuts really dulling the taste and drying it out, you have to drench the pancake in syrup to bring out any flavor.  I also had a taste of the basic buttermilk pancakes with toppings of chocolate chips and bananas (separately).  Oddly, while both are listed as \"toppings\" on the menu, the chocolate chips are mixed into the pancake while the banana is simply sliced and provided on the side.  It would have been nice (as I've seen plenty of other breakfast spots do) to work the banana slices directly into the pancake.  I had very very high hopes for the slab bacon, which comes out as some of the thickest slices of bacon I've seen in town, but the bacon could have used a little more time cooking in order to reach that perfect balance of a crunchy exterior and tender interior.  You might be better off with the bacon at Katz Club Diner or Original Pancake House (though admittedly not nearly as thick).  The Vietnamese-style sausage patties were pretty uninspiring--maybe a hint of Asian flavor but otherwise pretty plain.

Service was friendly, though little attention seemed to be paid to the decaf coffee which was served lukewarm and (like all coffee) in paper cups (I suppose for those longing for some kind of Starbucks aesthetic).  It looked like the regular coffee was prepared/stored differently and didn't have the same temperature snafus.  On the plus side, I did like the idea of \"happy hour\" from 1pm to 3pm, where all pancakes cost only $5.  Overall, though, there are a number of similar places, even just on the near West side, where you can get a better weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot! The food was delicious, most items just under ten bucks, and the service was great. I would highly recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I went here a few months back for brunch.

Crowded and TINY, like really small. Expect people to stare at you eat because they have no where else to turn and look.

The food is good but very, very sweet. Also where it shouldn't be called breakfast but candy. The red velvet pancakes i think were actually just red velvet cake with frosting. Not kidding.

The service staff was nice. Good coffee."}
{"text":"absolutely perfect brunch place. great sized menu with not too many options. they clearly know what they're good at and stick to it! had the lemon and berry pancakes with a side of pork belly which was TO DIE FOR. seriously you must get the pork belly. great service, super friendly and helpful staff and wonderful atmosphere. couldn't recommend it enough! will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This place is really affordable and also serves delicious brunch food! I was especially happy that Jack Flaps specializes in the sweeter brunch palate--they have an amazing array of waffles, toast, and pancakes.

The only con is that it is a very small cafe and wait times are a mess. But the staff are very friendly. Def would return! So glad we came."}
{"text":"Yum! We picked this place out of the blue, and it was a great pick! At first my husband was a little skeptical because he's not much of guy who comes out of his comfort zone. He's 100% a meat and potato guy, who likes a typical breakfast. I'm opposite, I love trying new things and always looking to try something different. I ordered the \"Fat Elvis\", and it was divine. The whipped peanut butter, fresh banana, and pralines bacon on top of a fluffy waffle was amazing. It wasn't heavy or too sweet, it was rich in a fulfilling way. My husband ordered the burrito, which was wonderful too. It's a tortilla stuffed with salsa, shredded meat, root vegetable hash, scrambled eggs, and sour cream. It had then right amount of heat in every bite, and my husband is not a fan of spicy. But he loved this! We ordered a side of bacon (which is pork belly bacon), and it was cooked to perfection. Service was great, and I love the clever bathroom signs. If you're ever in Cleveland, looking to try something different, I strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy day for sure. Seemed like they were understaffed. (but it was an observed holiday for a lot of people) one waitress was covering the whole dining room. So everyone waited patiently in line to get seated. Food was good. Definitely have some good flavor combinations of sweet and savory brunch options."}
{"text":"First time here. The Elvis pancakes are soo good. The burrito was pretty tasty too. Not a huge fan of the sausage. Make sure you have time to wait to be seated. Not a very large place, so they can only seat so many. Staff very friendly and enjoyable. Over experience good not great."}
{"text":"Came with friends on a Saturday afternoon. Found street parking right outside and although the place was full, we were seated right away at the bar. The staff seemed friendly and like they actually enjoyed working there. Now the food...

Coffee - Came in paper cups? What??? Does the environment mean nothing to you?! Also seems a bit cheap. 

Our plates were served without butter and syrup which are kind of essential at a breakfast joint. 

Candied Jalapeno pancakes -  These were really great once we got some syrup.
Buckbuck Wheat pancakes - I did not care for these, but my friend enjoyed them.
Cornbread Waffle - Way too dry even after adding egg yokes, hot sauce, and syrup. I just ate the center and left the rest. 
Root Vegetable Hash - Amazing! 
Mexican Coke-Glazed Pork Belly - Disappointing. Maybe stick with crispy bacon?
Bruleed Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding - Friends took this home, so no idea on taste, but it looked good! 
S.O.S. - Took this home to try later. Was good after I added pepper jack cheese. Wish it was more of a gravy though for the bread to soak up instead of a thick paste. 

Overall there are some quality items at Jack Flaps, but there are still some things that are lacking. I guess I just prefer my waffles and pancakes to have that buttery crispy edge and that light fluffy center that does NOT make you choke from being too dense and dry. It's one of those trendy gimmicky places you have to try at least once, but you'll probably enjoy cheaper prices and better food at your local diner."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar this past Sunday. Our waitress was slow and after an hour of sitting there she told us that she had forgotten to put in our order-after already telling us that it was in its way. I ordered the buckwheat pancakes, too sweet, couldn't eat them. When Eric came to say hello we told him about our waitresses' mistake and also how sweet the pancakes were and he was pleasant but went on to tell us that she was \"new\" and that I wasn't the first patron to mention the panacakes were sweet but offered no option to fix it.

After our $45.00 came I walked out of the restaurant still hungry and completely disgusted. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"My first visit Cleveland and this was the first stop of the day!

Came for brunch...a very late brunch, say around 1pm haha. There is a sign-in sheet and the wait was a good 30-45min. But since there was just 2 of us, we decided to opt for the bar seating and ended up getting seated in 15-20min. 

It's a pretty small space, which gives it the little-cafe type of feel. But the atmosphere is sleek and clean and seems like most of the people there were of the young adult crowd. I enjoyed the vibes.

For breakfast we tried the Breakfast Banh Mi as well as the Mexican Eggs Benedict. The Banh Mi was very interesting. It was something I've never seen on a brunch menu, so of course we had to try it. It had all the flavors you'd expect, but also had the breakfast components with the egg. The Mexican Eggs Benedict had a chorizo mash as the meat, topped with the normal egg, and drizzled with a spicy mexican green sauce. The bread underneath was supposed to be cornbread (which i was most excited for because i LOVE cornbread), but unfortunately they ran out. Early bird actually does get the worm, I suppose. Although I couldn't have the cornbread, I got to choose any other bread to have underneath. I went with rye bread and it was pretty good.

In addition for the last 2 hours that they're open, which I believe is 1-3pm, they have happy hour. During happy hour, their pancakes and waffles are...ONLY 5$!! Normally priced around $9-12, this is a GREAT deal...so of course we had to try them right? We tried the lavender pancakes. They honestly tasted a little like a soap/candle/bath bomb from Bath and Body Works or something...but even so, they were really yummy haha. So... I guess the late bird also gets a worm haha.

I'll definitely be back one day when I return to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've ever had.  The teramisu pancakes were out of this world.   Robin was amazing to watch and took good care of us while keeping everyone else happy at the same time. Quite a treat."}
{"text":"Brings breakfast to a whole new level! Always get a sunny side egg on top! The service was very nice and accommodating to new customers. We didn't even have to wait. As we were leaving, it started to get busy so come early. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Very busy place on the weekends! We got right in however because we had two people. Had the breakfast burrito with a perfectly flavored spicy beef inside (and lots of beef!). I had the graham cracker Nutella waffle with browned marshmallows and it was a sweet indulgence that hit the spot. Craving sweets and or savories?! Here is where it's all at."}
{"text":"On vacation and went be here and it is fantastic. Great service, small but nice dinning room with fun photography on the walls. Fast attentive servers, food was incredible. I had the burritto and it was super good."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and boy was it outstanding.  First you have to find Jack Flaps, it is easy to miss as it is a small storefront in the middle of a row of stores; there is not a big sign so look closely.  Once inside you find a small very modern diner set up with a small counter and some tables.  Service was attentive and friendly.

I got there at the perfect time as from 1-3pm they have a \"happy hour\" where any pancakes or waffles are $5; a deal that is hard to beat.  Based on the waitress recommendation and the description I had the Lemon Curd Flapjacks with a side of over easy eggs.   The two eggs were very nicely cooked, the yolks set without being overcooked, add some of the hot sauce and they were tasty.

The flapjacks were among the best I have had, two good sized pancakes about 8\" across, they were thicker than most you find, expertly cooked with crispy edges and fluffy middle.  Topped with a generous portion of tart lemon curd and a very nice berry jam this was one of the most tasty breakfast dishes I can remember.  The sweet jam balancing out the tangy curd.  The graham crackers were nice, but seemed a bit superfluous.  

I am looking forward to going back to work my way through other items on the menu.  If you like breakfast items, you have got to get to Jack Flaps."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I knew it was gonna be good, but, oh my goodness. I stumbled in this morning, bleary eyed, barely verbal. First, those 2 boys manning the front of the house, very cute and smiling, and most importantly, pouring the coffee. 

I had the jalapeno pancakes: light, it's-so-fluffy-i'm-gonna-die-golden-cake, studded with mild, fresh green jalapeno, with the right amount of kick. But wait- the  whipped cream and crunchy little salted coffee brittle pieces? what is this sorcery?

It's not cheap for breakfast, but worth every penny for the quality and service. I walked out wearing syrup down the front of my sweater and a hot cup of coffee to go. bah! I'll be back and I'll be bringing friends.

one thing, it might be a little hard to spot, i drove past it twice. look for the red neon sign from the tattoo shop, and they are across the street."}
{"text":"Pretty great breakfast joint. The restaurant is decorated nicely. I found myself staring at the photo of milk being poured on a man.

I ordered the apple bourbon waffle. It was tasty, but a little too sweet. I definitely would order the sauce/syrup on the side next time. I like the touch of granola and candied almonds on top though. Anyway, it's a decent place, but I still feel like it was a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Avoid peak or busy periods.
We went after the rush, still quite slow.
The Ohio pancake wasn't very tasty.  Regular pancakes better, also a lot of money for 2 pancakes (10 bucks each)."}
{"text":"oh. my. gosh. I love this place-came here based on the other reviews and it was so delicious! Attentive friendly service with a cute atmosphere. We had the Elvis pancake, breakfast burrito, and Korean sandwich--which I'm now blanking on the name. The breakfast burrito had a little kick to it and the meat was seasoned really well. You must go here if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Fantastic for brunch! Food was on par and tasted exactly as delicious as it read on the menu. It was hard to narrow down our choices- it all sounded good! They have sweet and savory sections, so we opted for one of each. 

To get: lemon curd pancakes- just sweet enough. Fluffy snf perfect. Also ordered the benedict with a heaping of their house-made hot sauce. Pork belly and chili in the dish was the perfect compliment to the corn bread base.

We got a side of hash and breakfast kimchi. Hash was great, we didn't care so much for the kimchi. In addition to that Korean side, they had Vietnamese influences like Bahn mi. 

Servers were helpful and friendly. Showed up around noon and had a 20 minute wait. Not bad, considering how tiny the place is. Maybe 10 to 15 tables in the place. There was a bar with 10 seats, too, and there were solo people and couples eating there. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and was satisfied overall.  We ordered two items from both the sweet and savory menus. They brought everything out at once, so we ended up having to eat the sweet stuff first or else the waffles would get soggy. Probably not a good decision for our appetite, but we still smashed. In retrospect, maybe we should've requested the sweet to be brought out later...

RED VELVET WAFFLE with Mason's Creamery's ice cream: The ice cream was the highlight. The waffle? Eh. I'm REALLY big on waffle texture. It's gotta be crisp on the outside and light and moist on the inside. This was more of a cake texture. Soft and thick. It was ok I guess, but would not get again.

GRAHAM CRACKER WAFFLE: basically a s'mores waffle. Texture was the same for this one, and the waffle didn't have any flavor. The toppings were good, but the waffle disappointed and I don't know if I would get it again.

DEVILED BENEDICT - Deviled eggs on smoked salmon on mixed greens on a toasted baguette: AMAZING. Probably one of the best breakfast dishes Cleveland has to offer. The salmon (aka gravlax) was amazeballs. I would come back every time for this, although it is the most expensive thing on the menu ($14).

SHRIMP AND GRITS - Very good. There was a garlicky-buttery flavor that was a little overpowering in the sauce, but I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

So despite the less-than-stellar experience with the waffles, I really, really liked the rest of our food, and I'll definitely be back. I think they could do really well if they highlighted and expanded their savory menu and put the sweet stuff in the backseat.

Oh, and I read that their \"banh mi\" made top breakfast sandwich in America or something, which is impressive, but the Asian in me couldn't bring myself to order it when it has very little in common with the traditional banh mi. I feel like they just called it banh mi because banh mi is popular these days, but anyway..."}
{"text":"This Is A Very Cool Breakfast Spot. My Husband & I Were Super Excited To Visit This Past Monday At 10:00 a.m. After Viewing The Menu Online We Were Super Pumped To Try The Vietnamese Sausage, Banh Mi & Breakfast Burrito With The Beef. Unfortunately Our Server Informed Us That They Only Had Pork Belly As Meat. We Were Not Happy Campers. But We Ordered Something Different Which It Was Nice The Burrito Was Had A Lil Chorizo Instead. We Just Didn't Understand Why At 10:00 Three Breakfast Items Were Not Available To Order. On An Already Short Menu."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday at 1130 and sat immediately. The place is not very large, so I would imagine on the weekends it would be a very long wait. 

Food- I had the Lake Erie Benedict and it was phenomenal. The poached egg looked a little different than the traditional, but still added that great yolky substance to the meal. The base of the Benedict was polenta, and it was great. I also had a side of tender belly pork, which was phenomenal.

I would come back, but not likely on a weekend."}
{"text":"I went here for their awesome happy hour ($5 jackflaps and waffles- 1-3pm) and couldn't have been happier. We had a short wait to get a table since it is a pretty small space, but our food came out quickly enough and the waitress was attentive. The restaurant itself is very casual and the tables are pretty close together. They have some fun themed photo art on the walls as well.

They have a creative menu of mostly waffles and pancakes. We tried the winter jam waffle, with brie and some delicious candied oranges, as well as the meat and taters waffle, a wonderful mix of meat and veggies on a potato waffle. The food was tasty and unique; definitely a good place to try for brunch."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but the service.. It's the worst of any restaurant I've been to in Cleveland. They are terrible about getting you seated timely, they forget utensils, never come back to check on you, give attitude when you ask for the check. The food IS good, but it is not worth it to endure the lowest level of customer service. We gave it two tries and on the second when it was worse than the first, we decided we'd never come back."}
{"text":"Cozy environment. Innovative menu items. Great service. We interacted with just about every front-end employee during our visit. 

The root veggie hash is excellent, and you can't beat pancakes and waffles for $5 between 1 and 3p-- which was delicious, by the way. 

We had heard great things about this prior to our visit, and the experience did not disappoint. We'll definitely be back, and we definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I love this place! The Nutella waffle and hash is where it's at! It gets busy so be prepared to wait a few minutes."}
{"text":"Came here after the pop-up flea and was semi disappointed. It was extremely loud even sitting in the last table by the kitchen. We ordered a vast amount of food to all share : Strawberry Shortcake (me), Original flaps with eggs on top, fat elvis, and the cornbread waffle.

Strawberry shortcake: Honestly disappointed... the sprinkles to me ruined the flaps and wasn't many strawberries with it. Kinda blah..

Original flaps- they were really good and the eggs over-easy were perfectly cooked.

Fat Elvis- HOLY sweet! It was good however they came with these black things that were so hard you couldn't eat them unless you wanted to be making a trip to the dentist. 

Cornbread waffle- by far the best we ordered- the pulled pork itself was delicious.

Another disappointment- no alcohol!! However I highly recommend their coffee."}
{"text":"The hostess situation today was clearly jacked. I love the food but I'm pissed enough to stop recommending this place to friends and stop trying to bring out-of-town guests here. 

We had a party of 5 and were told there would be a 20-30min wait. No problem there. There were only about 3 people waiting in line before our party...Still no problem. Because the space is limited and it was cold outside, I told the hostess I would wait outside so that they had space for people who wanted to wait in the warmth. 30min later she comes out and says it will be 20 more minutes because there's 2 other 5 tops ahead of us. There were literally 3 other folks in line when I went outside and then a rush of people after. We got bumped and the hostess clearly didn't care. When I asked her about this, she said that we were marked BRB because I wasn't waiting inside and she thought we left. I was outside in front of the window in clear sight AND told her I'd be outside. She had also listed another party as BRB and they came back as well, don't know why she's marking people as not there when she's not even checking. 

Why didn't she mention this when I told her I'd wait outside? It's too bad because I've recommended this place to quite a few friends and I support many of the owners other businesses. They really shouldn't have someone who gives zero f$&ks hostessing."}
{"text":"Pretty good food especially for the price, lot of interesting ideas. I had the tiramisu pancakes and they were pretty good."}
{"text":"You can't really tell from the outside, but the place has a really nice vibe. Modern design and deco. Very comfortable having brunch in there. Food was really slow though, thus the minus one star. Yet, the food was definitely worth the wait - Original Buttermilk Jack Flaps with berry compote and Happy Jack Waffle (I could see an effort of making it look like a smiley face :)) I prefer the flaps, but both were awesome. Oh, and their coffee is great too. A bit pricey for breakfast though but for us, it was a brunch. So... for breakfast and lunch combined, the price was ok. Ate at 10, now almost 2 and still super full. Probably gonna be full till dinner time."}
{"text":"Oh I wanted to love this place with all my heart. The menu is just divine, I love breakfast and I love creative breakfast. Came here with my brother while showing him around Cleveland, ordered the PB&J eggy bread and the cornmeal waffle w/ pork and a side of root vegetable hash to share. 

The great: hot sauce on the root veg hash. Just needed a huge order of this and would've been good. The cereal milk whipped cream. The whipped peanut butter. Nom.

The not-so-great: Yesterday's waffles. You guys. I swear to you the waffles  and french toast are made in a big batch and set in a heater. And it doesn't matter if that's not the case because that's exactly what they taste like. No crispy edges on the french toast, no fluffiness inside the waffle. 

I don't mean any disrespect. The food LOOKED beautiful and I love, love Momocho (same owner), but the quality wasn't there. a simple change to the preparation or cooking method and some tweaks to the batter would make this a knock out, but eh."}
{"text":"This past Sunday was my second time here. My friends and I got there at 12:30, waited for a short period of time and then sat at the bar. The dining room is tiny, but service is so fast, that tables flip fairly quickly. We ordered kimchi, side of root vegetable hash, shrimp and grits, Nutella and graham cracker waffle. Everything was delicious. The hot coffee seemed to be refilling itself without me noticing."}
{"text":"Delicious. Had the Fat Elvis waffle and was not disappointed. I wasn't crazy about my yoohoo coffee drink but overall the food was tasty. I'll be sure to come back to try the other tasty sounding dishes."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER THE DEVILS BENEDICT.  I can't express enough how horrible this plate was.  The salmon was chewy and extra fishy tasting, the deviled eggs were just ok, the filling was kind of watery.  My advice, just go with the sweet stuff.  I reordered and went with the Fat Elvis (waffles) and it was delicious, made it worth my time.  The staff was very nice and understanding about handing the first order back.  I would check it out again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice....in the same month. 

MOVE TO A BIGGER LOCATION haha

Expect to wait, but it's worth it, I promise. Especially for the $5 special after 1pm. 

I recommend the graham cracker waffle and the burrito, both are amazing!

Note: if they are busy, expect to sit with strangers, if you are cool with that, awesome, if you like your space, go during a slow time (like a weekday around 12pm)"}
{"text":"I'd give this place more stars if I could. I took my daughters here for Sunday brunch and our minds were blown. 

The serving staff was beyond friendly and the food was the best breakfast food we've ever had. Our waitress was a real sweetie and very attentive, my daughters wanted to take her home with us - ha!

My daughters got the orange pancakes and the graham cracker waffles. I got the shrimp and grits and we split a plate of pork belly - all AMAZING. I noticed alot of folks around us ordered the burrito and could over hear them talking about how delicious it was. You can't go wrong with this place, or their \"happy hour\" from 1-3 on Sunday where our pancakes were half off and our sodas were free! 

Additionally, their homemade hot sauce is divine and the coffee was fabulous. We would eat here every weekend if we could! Go in with an appetite and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always a great spot for breakfast! Waited 45 mins for a table, but well worth it. 
My party had the shrimp w/grits (topped with 2 sunny eggs), the root vegetable hash, Vietnamese patties and lemon curd jack flaps. Every thing was delicious!


Only complaint was the patties were slightly too salty"}
{"text":"I tried this place twice after seeing good reviews. The staff was snotty and smug both times. The flavor combinations were bizarre and not enjoyable. This place is decidedly overhyped and underwhelming."}
{"text":"I loved this place but recentley I was there and the menu is awfully small. The service is terrible, the food was no where near what it was in the past. They brought the wrong food and it took forever to even come out. The table had no silverware, no sugar, no napkins. The server came a total of two times. She brought a coffee we didn't ask for. I truly loved this place but now it is an over priced trendy hole in the wall that is just not worth it."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place but was so disappointed once I finally gave this place a try. The menu changes often so the items I initially wanted to try were not there but I ordered lavender crème brule pancakes and scrambled egg whites. The wait for food from the bar was about 20 minutes. However, my egg whites were messed up and came out as regular eggs and not scrambled. The pancakes were delicious however, they were so hard on the bottom it was impossible to cut. I told the waitress and she stated they weren't hard or burnt they try to aim for 'crispy'....I couldn't even finish my pancakes, it was too difficult and hard. After being there for an hour my water was never even refilled. You would think the bar would be more considerate on things like that. I wasn't really happy with my experience here but the food that I was able to eat was pretty good. I believe this place has great potential but is not all the way there yet."}
{"text":"I LOVE Jack Flaps. It might be my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Service is always super friendly, attentive, and quick, and the food is amazing. My mom and I love to go for happy hour on Saturdays, when waffles and flapjacks are $5. It's an absolute steal, and makes it so that you don't have to decide between your favorite on the menu and the new seasonal specials - GET BOTH! Breakfast burrito is incredible (and try the hot sauce, trust me), and my favorite waffle I've had has to be the carrot cake (which is seasonal). 

If you're not adventurous, the original buttermilk pancakes will probably be the best you've ever had. Not an ideal spot for large groups, but that's part of the reason I love it!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, long wait time, small-ish place but still was worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"We've had breakfast a couple times now when visiting my sister, who lives in the area. It's become a top pick for us when deciding where to go. Obviously, as the name suggests, they have a few pancake options, which in my experience are all creative and delicious. I'm a big fan of their lemon curd and my sister loves the granola pancakes. They also have savory dishes that have unique spins and a fairly wide range of flavors. The space is fairly small, but can accommodate a larger group - we normally end up there with at least six of us. I will give this tip though: get there early! We always have and have never had to wait. But I've always struggled to get past the line that has formed by the time we leave."}
{"text":"Been here many times now ---- always great ---- good service even when slammed (like it always is)"}
{"text":"We got the Breakfast Banh Mi and Garbage Plate. They looked delicious but tasted very average. The Garbage plate was more sour than we expected. The bread of the Banh Mi was kind of soggy because of the over easy egg. It probably would've tasted better if the bread were toasted."}
{"text":"Really good, innovative breakfast/brunch menu.  Lemon curd / blueberry flapjacks, breakfast burrito, and graham waffle all great! This is a cool place that also has excellent coffee. They were also very friendly to our two kids, who enjoyed their food as much as the adults."}
{"text":"I took a day trip to Cleveland this past Sunday, and this was my first stop on my food list. The decor is a very hip, eggy vibe (see photos), but rather small. I think the size fits the feel. I ordered a waffle combo that had Brie, orange marmalade, and almonds with a side of pork belly. When the order arrived, the waffles had CASHEWS! Ok, this is a big deal because I'm allergic to all nuts EXCEPTION almonds and peanuts, and I made absolutely sure the description only listed almonds. Also, the pork belly was cooked a little too long, to the point where some pieces were just downright burnt. The server was apologetic and took back my waffles swiftly. Although I enjoyed the waffles, I ALMOST walked away with a swollen throat. Lol"}
{"text":"I have been to Jack Flaps 2 times and each time I ordered the DELICIOUS Tiramisu jack flaps. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert in the world, so I was obviously intrigued by this unique menu item. I absolutely loved this breakfast item take on the traditional tiramisu desert! I love the taste of espresso, so the espresso custard on top was a wonderfully \"wicked\" and slightly bitter addition to very sweet pancakes. The vanilla mascarpone topping was light, fluffy, and sweet and complemented the custard very well! This meal was VERY filling and well worth the $10.50. I barely had to add any syrup to these pancakes to moisten them because the pancakes were so well-prepared.

I cannot give this place 5 stars because I am very disappointed that there aren't more vegetarian options. I usually order savor meals at a brunch place and there are NO vegetarian options on this menu- unless you look at the sides menu, which isn't an ideal place to start. Also, the venue is small, so it would be hard to take a group of people there!"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent - would recommend going.  The area is kind of cool as well, there is a lot to do there"}
{"text":"holy brunchness~ or breakfast, whichever you prefer! 

one word to sum it up: DELICIOUS!

not your ordinary schmordinary take on 'flapjacks' or any breakfast food, really. every bite was a delightful taste of flavors. 

our party of three ordered off the savory menu. none of us were disappointed. my only complaint is that there is not a 'sweet' item on the side menu. i wanted to order one pancake and that was not an option. they did have grits with a cinnamon butter, but i would have liked the option of a cinnamon roll or one pancake for that sweet tooth obsession i have. 

over all this is a great addition to the cleveland area, for a delightful breakfast or brunch choice.

oh, side note. be prepared to wait. it is very small inside and seems like it is always crowded by the steady stream of people coming and going! it was definitely worth the wait. oh, and one more thing. fabulous coffee, which they serve up in a to-go cup! perfect for the ride home!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin...this place does not deserve even one star. The menu is very limited and bad service.

I like to try new places when I visit Cleveland...I will not return. If you are looking for overprice mediocre breakfast food, no coffee/water refills, and rude male servers this is the place!

The Benedicto Mexicano is like eating dry bread with spicy sloppy Joe's and two eggs on top! Out-of-towners beware...extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"So disappointed. 

This was a very small, little yuppie place
If you are looking for that type of environment, then you've found it. 

The menu was much smaller than I thought it would be. I ordered regular plain pancakes and they weren't cooked in the center. Pancakes are the thicker type

Also, their house syrup is some crazy cinnamon syrup but they don't tell you that, so be warned

Coffee was good."}
{"text":"There was only one front-of-house worker in a full restaurant, and he did phenomenal for his lack of support, but obviously things were slow. Good coffee. The food was average. Pancakes tasted like fluffy bread and syrup, except they were $10. The pork and waffles were not that great. A few small thin slices of chewy pork with some cooked vegetables over a waffle, $11. Not sure what all the rave is about. I'd pass next time."}
{"text":"We went for sunday brunch meal.Great food. Had the buck buck wheat pancakes and my enjoyed the currant buckwheat waffle.very good food ,a friendly and attentive wait staff.the place was a bit noisy and not the place for a quiet breakfast and a coffee to go with conversation.many other items on nearby diners looked great. Will go again , but at a different time of the week."}
{"text":"The place was very small and nothing is wrong with that, but it was something wrong with the place being small and packed and only one server trying to handle everyone by her self. (She did pretty good based on the situation, but she should not have had to.) My food was pretty good, but not sure if I would make the trip from east to west for it again, unless I was in the area durning breakfast time."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting better.  Happy hour is now 1-3 pm with all flapjacks and waffles for just $5. Open now daily from 7 AM to 3 PM. Today's fare is shrimp and grits with sunny side up eggs, root hash and breakfast kimchi. 

Currently they are featuring their Jack's Platform Brewhouse menu from 4-11 PM Fridays with Platform's Prodigal Pale + Ohio City Cuban = Beereakfast. 

Fast, friendly and delicious - the way good should be."}
{"text":"Jack Flaps is my guilty pleasure! It's an Ohio City breakfast essential and their happy hour (1-3) is a steal. They offer $5 waffles during this time as if the regular prices weren't good enough to keep me coming back. If waffles don't tickle your fancy try the massive breakfast burrito. It's a meal fit for a giant. Oh! And don't forget to try their home made hot sauce. It's shockingly good."}
{"text":"I have been to Jack Flaps twice and had consistent experiences.  For Sunday breakfast, I recommend getting there as early as possible, as the wait time gets exponentially longer.  

This place is uncomfortably tight and the food porn on the walls just isn't doing it for me.  Cramming hungry, hungover people into a loud, narrow space that overlooks the dining room is not ideal (imagine the envy of the starving line-goer).

Once you sit down it gets much better.  Having had enough time to drool over the menu in line, they usually ask if you'd like to put your order in immediately.  The menu is split into \"Sweet\" and \"Savory.\"  My first time around, I ordered the Breakfast Burrito, which is out of control!!  My girlfriend always gets the Carrot Cake Waffle, which I have tried and can attest--it is slammin' as well.  Can't forget the to-go style coffee cups with a fill-up for the road, very thoughtful.

A well-considered, enticing menu, but I just don't dig the vibes in this place.  If they knocked down a wall or found a larger location, I would be there."}
{"text":"Great quality food. Such great breakfast spot and a staple of Cleveland. Amazing pancakes. Try to go early as the place is ok the smaller side but what it lacks in size it makes up for in EVERYTHING ELSE! Can't want to go again."}
{"text":"Cool breakfast spot. May be a little trendy, but worth trying for sure.  Be patient for breakfast with chef power.  The place is small, but cozy and well appointed.  Service is attentive and well paced for the experience.  You should not come in a hurry to a place like this anyway.  Enjoy breakfast at another level.  Chances are you will have a good/great experience.  Menu is somewhat limited, but what I have tried on the several occasions we have come has been great or very good."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for as long as they've been open. I use to love it and the staff. Lot of people left and the food started to decline. One time I came in and ordered grits because I use to love their grits, but the grits tasted like water. But they redeem themselves after that for a brief moment. 

Whenever he changes the menu the food just gets shittier and shittier. Stopped in recently and was met with two unfriendly faces. Sat at the bar and they acted like I was bothering them by sitting there. I order the old standard with no breakfast meat because I don't eat pork. The ladies looked confused, like I asked for something that wasn't on the menu. When my food came out it was disappointing, bland grits, undercooked hash and I asked for over easy eggs and they were over hard. It was a waste of my time and money. 

Hire better cooks and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The place is really small, beautiful and full of personality. When I lived in CLE, there were only a handful of places with as much personality as Jack Flaps. This joint is a great addition to Ohio city. 
I love breakfast. I especially love omeletes but I never say no to fun and potentially yummy dishes. The menu at JF was very creative. It is small but versatile. The server suggested the breakfast banm and the burrito with the braised short rib. I thought the burrito was ok, a bit too spicy for me but I liked it. The breakfast banm, which had a Vietnamese patty in it,  was to die for. I could eat that everyday. It had way too much cilantro for me, but the dish itself was fantastic. If i go next time I will try and order it without the cilantro. 
I too wasnt a fan of the coffee in the togo cups but the upside of it is that it is good coffee and you can walk away with it so I guess I shouldnt complain. 
Overall a great place. Strongly suggest it."}
{"text":"Holy goodness! Do yourself a favor and get the burrito. Just do it. Don't ask questions. Don't wonder about maybe getting something else. If you're coming here for the first time... GET. THE. BURRITO. 

My husband and I were starving for our 2pm brunch, so we both ordered a burrito for ourselves and we said we'd share the buckbuck wheat flap jacks. The burrito is a good size and filled me up so I could only take a few bites of the flap jacks that my husband ended up finishing. The flap jacks were good. The burrito was F*cking amazing. Filled with hashbrowns, eggs, braised beef, and whatever other goodness they put in their that makes it just just so so good. 

Prices are very reasonable and their coffee was also very good. Smooth and no bitterness at all. So happy my husband and I found this place."}
{"text":"Amazing Food! Fast service! Aesthetically pleasing environment! Beautiful food fun decor! Great tastes! Great pricing! 5 stars? You bet!!! Want the best bet for your pockets worth? You're looking at the place of your dream waffles and yummy yummy in your tummy mouth watering greatness that awaits you and your eyes!"}
{"text":"Jack Flaps was worth the wait. Waited about 20 minutes for a table, staff was friendly. Sat at the bar & enjoyed their signature coffee along with the F*ing Good Burrito. It had braised beef & lived up to its name. The homemade hot sauce was a nice compliment to the already tasty breakfast dish. Enjoyed the photography in the restaurant too."}
{"text":"Whenever I have a friend from out of town visit, or if I know anyone visiting Cleveland for the first time, I immediately give them a list of places to get food. Jack Flaps is always on the top of that list. 

Why? IT'S INCREDIBLE! Savory or sweet Jack Flaps will not disappoint. Delivering flavor and fun in every bite, Jack Flaps reminds me that going out for a meal is intended to be an experience. 

Every meal I've had has been amazing. So I honestly don't believe you can go wrong with anything off the menu - but I do have a few favorites I wanted to share. 

PB&J: on the 'Eggy Bread' portion of the menu. This personal fav. has Peanut Butter, homemade berry jam, Nutella (and we all said 'Amen'), topped with cereal milk whipped cream. SO sweet, but so worth it. Yolo, right?

Graham Cracker Waffle: My wife's current favorite. Topped with Nutella (again, Amen) and Brûléed marshmallows. I can't get enough. 

I can't stress this enough - you MUST get their Root Vegetable Hash. It's one of the best things I've ever eaten. Just the right amount of spice, and so full of flavor. You will not regret getting a side of this amazing dish. Tip: try it with their homemade hot sauce. CLUTCH!

They have an amazing happy hour. 1PM - 3PM any day $5 for any Jack Flaps & Waffles. 

So after so much praise - why the four stars? Unfortunately, the seating arrangement and wait time is a major bummer. 

It's a small place with minimal seating, but what kills them is their 6-top tables. Most parties of 2 aren't comfortable sharing a table with strangers. But unless you want to wait for your own table - this may be your only option. 

This may not be a huge issue on weekdays, but for brunch on a Saturday, plan on a potential 30-45 min wait, and you may be sitting cozy close with the stranger next to you.  

But patience is a virtue! And the wait is worth it once you get your first bite of food."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast / brunch in Ohio city. Everything is always good the staff is very friendly  especially Courtney , she's the best, shes waited on us many times and is always a pleasure. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I never realized how underrepresented breakfast is in quality dining around here. There are a few nice mom and pop diners, but Jackflaps is the only place I know that breaks tradition and gets creative. It is definitely what you'd expect from the minds behind Happy Dog, Mumocho, and Barrio--they have a lot if fun creating bold flavor combinations. 

The menu is tricky...its divided up by savory and sweet. Going in, I'm always craving bacon and eggs, but once the smell hits me its hard not to drool over the sweet options. I wish there were a few plates that gave you a bit of both, but there is always the option of ordering a waffle or eggy bread (commonly called French Toast) with eggs and/or pork belly on the side. Just plan on having leftovers to take home.

The best sweet I've had there is the carrot cake waffle. I've also tried the smores waffle, and it was good, but too sweet (i could only eat a few bites). But the best overall plate I've had is the SOS--my waitress suggested I add two sunny side up eggs on top, and I loved her for it--soooooo good. 

The downside? This place is small, but really popular, so you usually have to stand (in a narrow, crowded corridor) and wait. But trust me, the wait is well worth it!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast food- sweet and or savory. Staff is great. Neighborhood is a bit sketch. Dining here may send you into a delicious food coma."}
{"text":"Very disappointed after reading all the reviews. Came late so it was happy hour and we were seated right away, but a server didn't come until 15 minutes later (She decided to clear another table instead of coming to us, and didn't apologize when she finally did). I must say, the tiny request printed on the menus to use phones only to take pictures of the food really rubbed me the wrong way. I get that people may slow down your turn around of guests because they're checking reviews on what to order, but if you're holding me to that standard and expecting me to be prompt, I expect the same from your service, and that definitely did not happen. (We came in an hour before close, so I was hoping to order promptly so that we weren't keeping staff.)

Dishes are pricey without the happy hour.. I recommend waiting for it. Food was above average. Hash was a little greasy but did have a unique flavor. Waffle was sweet but didn't have any flavors that stood out. Croquet didn't leave a lasting impression and I felt like it was missing something to bring it to the next level. I also was a little irked by the coffee in paper cups due to the start of our bad first impression of the service. Paper cups are not as environmentally friendly, and require less refilling since the cap is covered, and we were not asked if we wanted a refill at the end.

I am not sure if I would try this place again, but we'll see. Sounds like there is a long wait during high time.. Not sure if the food was worth it for that, considering the poor service."}
{"text":"It's 8:15 am and they advertise they open at 7 am.   Doors closed and lights out.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here as I saw it had good reviews.  OMG! His menus has the most creative dishes for breakfast I have ever seen.

Lemon pancakes were awesome, root veggie hash was original and delicious!

You have got to try this place if you are in Cleveland, well worth the wait and drive"}
{"text":"What a cool breakfast joint! We came during the Rite Aid Marathon and sat facing the street. It wasn't until we were leaving that I took a look around at the artwork. The space is small, the menu not extensive, but it didn't need to be. I had the breakfast burrito and it was fantastic! Service is excellent! 
Added bonus? Great music in the background. Radio Station? iTunes Playlist? I don't know, but I heard PIL and Dead Kennedys. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This is the place I describe when making fun of hipsters. I thought I was going in to a neighborhood breakfast joint, But soon realized someone is using pancakes to pay off a masters degree they cant use.  First of all, giant photos of the owners are all over the walls, which is weird...It's like an important part of the pancakes is that they were crafted by more attractive hands than yours. Then I felt I was lectured by the menu, like someone as uncool as me could ever think of putting nutella on a waffle. No substitutions, which if you are a vegetarian narrows your options to almost nothing. In bold print it tells me no substitutions and no smartphones (but it also boasts free wifi.which i guess is for Instagram only) at which point i'm getting angry. I ended up paying 25 dollars for 4 Pancakes, one order of eggs, one order of hashbrowns and two coffees.  Thanks Jack Flaps, You pulled off the impossible. you made the ultimate comfort food unfriendly"}
{"text":"Oh, this place is very hip, delicious and awesome!!!  Seriously, we've gone here three times in the past four weeks already.

The location is not the best - it's sort of right on the edge of Ohio City and the not-to-good neighborhood just east of Ohio City.  But the food options - they are very inventive and taste amazing.  We love the graham cracker waffle; it also has chocolate and marshmallows which make it essentially a s'more in waffle form.  The breakfast banh mi is also my go-to dish now, it's a twist on a banh mi with eggs and sausage instead.

They have rotating items on the menu which have been very creative and haven't failed us yet - I've tried the clam bake benedict, a pulled pork waffle and lox breakfast salad, all of which were terrific.

They have \"happy hour\" every day (Saturday included) from 1-3 pm when you can get all of their waffles and pancakes for $5 each."}
{"text":"A little over the top, but some really great flavor combinations. You won't want this more than 1-2 times a year or you'd risk diabetes, but it's a great treat that leans more on the sweet side than the savory."}
{"text":"The service was great. Family style seating and the staff is very respectful of sitting children near you if you aren't welcoming of children....but who doesn't love a little child every once in a while. Raspberry waffle and the hot sauce on the root hash was bomb! Definitely recommend and worth the 15 minute wait."}
{"text":"like a kid in the candy store this places menu is to die for"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed is the perfect word. Jack Flaps has been on my radar for quite some time. So in between house hunting, my husband and I went (waaay) out of our way to stop in here for some brunch. I went with the seasonal Lavendar Crunch Waffle. It was drowning in a berry syrup. I tasted no lavendar, and the crunch part (toffee pieces) almost cracked my tooth. Could have been I picked the wrong thing, but the description sounded oh so good! Oh well. I gave it a shot!"}
{"text":"Delish flavors, bold coffee, intimate seating in a beautiful little spot, staff was fast-friendly-fashionable, and there is PLENTY of on street parking. Menu offers blended tastes of kimchi, root vegi hash, pork belly, buck wheat pancakes, the best f'ing breakfast burrito in cleveland and if thats too wild for your taste buds maybe you'll enjoy the old fashioned breakfast or a little clam bake breakfast surprise!!"}
{"text":"All around breakfast fail. Undercooked eggs with goopy whites and unpleasant kitchen. I love the Ohio City neighborhood and really wanted to like this local breakfast place. Went in on a quiet weekday morning and ordered the Pumpkin King Benedict. I asked if I could substitute something vegetarian for the ham. Staff came back and said 'the kitchen' can substitute the ham for the braised beef or the pork belly. I asked if the kitchen understood that I was asking for a vegetarian option. Staff replied that yes that was clear. Ok... so I asked if an easy vegetarian option could be the substitute, like maybe the breakfast kimchi (a cold pickled dish that is little stress or prep -- I also was curious about this dish anyway). Staff checked and said the kitchen said no. So, disappointed, I rolled with it and just chalked it up to another restaurant making extra cash from people eating vegetarian by giving them less food for the same price (I don't always eat vegetarian, by the way). After a wait (though the restaurant had only one other customer), the Pumpkin King Benedict came with undercooked fried eggs (as in very runny egg white undercooked) with extreme blasts of black pepper. Toasted pumpernickel were small flat tasteless disks and not really toasted. Hollandaise was a bit congealed and not particularly pumpkin-y. Ugh.

Bright spot of the visit was the table staff -- really nice and sympathetic (almost embarrassed telling me my absurd 'veg' options were to sub ham with beef or pork), but couldn't control 'the kitchen'. Sad, because I wanted to like the place and I also love the character Jack, the Pumpkin King. Instead -- nah, skip Jack Flaps."}
{"text":"Superb pancakes. Not too sweet, just rich enough. Melt in your mouth delicious. The service is a little slow and the place fills up fast, but the eponymous flaps sell themselves. Very, very tasty."}
{"text":"If I'm going to pay $2.5 for coffee... Put it in a coffee mug, not a flimsy paper thing... No omelettes and pancake combo"}
{"text":"I can't give enough praise to this place. They have the most delicious pancakes/waffles. And dare I say the best root vegetable hash I have EVER eaten. I dream about that root vegetable hash. I recently ordered the candied jalapeño pancakes, and boy were they incredible. I love the small interior and the atmosphere inside. They discourage the use of smartphones unless for instagramming #foodporn, which is great. Oh and don't forget to take advantage of the happy hour from 1-3...$5 waffles and pancakes! Great for splitting a couple different dishes!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I visit it every time I'm in Cleveland. The jalapeño pancakes are off the chain. You can't go wrong in this place. Love it. Love it love it."}
{"text":"Currant Buckwheat waffle; I was aiming for something that wasn't basically a dessert. Waffle was excellent and fluffy. Berry topping was just the right amount of tart but still a little sweet for my liking. I should have been ready for that though because it was a sugary jam  dusted with powdered sugar and a crushed snickerdoodle cookie! Still ate the whole darn thing. Pancakes seem to be slightly larger portions

Hash Browns were amazing. could have got a double order. Some of the best I've had.

Service was great. Coffee was topped off 3 or 4 times while eating."}
{"text":"I had the Fat Elvis and my husband had the tiramisu pancakes, both delish! Coffee was awesome too! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am currently on a diet. So when choosing places to eat at I have to make sure they have options I can eat. To put it simple it's similar to the Atkins diet. A no to very low carb deal. 

I ordered from the savory side menu: 2 eggs, Vietnamese style sausage patties and Mexican coke glaze pork belly. Almost got the root vegetable hash but there were some items that were too high in carb. The eggs and sausage was good, however the pork belly was tough and dry not what I expect it to be like, tender and juicy. 

I would recommend this place it has great options for everyone. My fiancé got the burrito and loved it! The pancakes look and sound amazing. I will absolutely have to come back to try those when I'm not on a diet."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place. It was the first time I was able to go out to eat, as I finished chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant months prior. I got the tiramisu pancakes. Second bite- I felt the hardest piece in my mouth. I spit it out immediately. My husband and I were shocked at what we found! It was a piece of cleaning bristle! About .5 inch long. You could definitely see that it was a cleaning bristle. I was SO upset and angry. 

Worst part about it: she made us a new stack of pancakes- and gave us a bill of $35. 

I was shocked we even paid for our meal. I didn't even have the energy to argue about us paying and we left HIGHLY unsatisfied. Wasted $35. And we threw the new pancakes out! Take care of your customers!"}
{"text":"The hash browns are phenomenal! I also had eggs, toast and pancake.  All great! Food is a little pricey, I don't recommend it for kids (mine like simple food), but the quality is amazing. The breakfast items are definitely not something I can easily recreate at home!"}
{"text":"So, the customer service is definitely lacking. They aren't attentive and are slow. 

Savory dishes: AMAZING! I had the breakfast bahn mi and was so impressed. It was perfection. My coworker had the breakfast burrito and I swear I saw a single tear drop from his eye. 

Sweet dishes: they were okay. I had a cinnamon pecan eggy bread which wasn't bad, but had this been the only thing I ordered I wouldn't ever come back to this establishment. My coworker had the JackDFlaps and felt the same way. 

We overindulged, but I have no regrets."}
{"text":"This was an awesome brunch experience. The service and atmosphere are young and hip. The food is to die for. You have to get the Mexican coke bacon on the side. We tried the buckwheat flap jacks (so fluffy and love the crunch of the oats) and breakfast banh mi. I'm Vietnamese and I'm loving this take on our sandwich, even down to the everything cream cheese. Finally, try their house made hot sauce and o.j. (it tastes fresh squeezed). Will definitely be frequenting this place."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Overpriced. Hashbrowns tasted oddly sweet for some reason. I don't know what the deal is with their bacon, but it's weird and it tastes terrible. It's one thing to go to an uppity (organic, grass fed, locally bla bla bla) place for dinner, but breakfast? Yea these are special gourmet pancakes, that's why they cost $8. Like they churned the buttermilk in the back room this morning... give me a break."}
{"text":"Amazing food, cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, great prices. Coffee was delicious. The carrot cake blew my mind. The menu has many interesting and unusual items. I will come back to taste the rest."}
{"text":"We did wait 30 for a table of three on a Sunday at noon but the food is really really delicious, the portions are big enough to satisfy anybody whose angry and the personal of the restaurant was really nice and fast. Price goes to 7$ to 12$. Coffee are at 2,5$ which is kinda expensive."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Cleveland. Great for brunch and in a good location."}
{"text":"Their happy hour on pancakes and waffles is the best deal in town! The only bummer is that it's almost always crowded on weekends, so there will probably be a wait, but people clamoring to get in is a testament to it's quality. I'm more keen on waffles because of the texture and little nooks that store more butter and syrup, so my most recent waffle was Carrot Cake. Loved it!! My only gripe: Give me more of the delicious buttercream!  My friend got the Jokers Wild pancakes, which was a huge serving and decadently sweet. I always get the Coke glazed pork belly as a side because... well, it's pork belly, the most heavenly part of a pig. Unique flavor profiles all around. 

I also love that their menu has a note to customers discouraging the use of  phones (unless they are snapping some food porn pictures for Yelp! or Instagram). They want their customer's brunch to be a social gathering. That sentiment can be lost at a lot of establishments now a days."}
{"text":"I loved this place. We went right when they opened so there was  no line. Everyone's food looked wonderful and our tasted great. very creative food. I thought it was strange that the coffee came in plastic cups but was happy to take a cup to go with me. at least it was decent coffee. I wonder if I could bring my own cup with me?"}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Root hash was to die for! We had the burrito, old standard, and the Elvis. Everything was great and we look forward to coming again."}
{"text":"Cool place, always packed and the staff has always been great. Some meals I've had have blown me away and others were just so-so. I'm more a savory person for breakfast/brunch but their sweet options are what a lot of my dining companions have raved about. Definitely give this place a shot if you are in the area and craving a good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I am sitting in Flap Jacks now - 
Not a good experience - 
- slow service with an attitude
- food was cold
- one of our orders was wrong
- No Air conditioning (its super hot inside) only 75 outside
- funky flavor on our meal
- dine at your own risk"}
{"text":"A friend had been wanting to check this place out for a while so we stopped in on a Sunday afternoon around 1 for a late brunch.  They close at 3pm on weekends and 2pm on weekdays so be sure to check the time if you're planning on going. They also offer a happy hour from 1pm-3pm where their waffles and jackflaps are $5 each which equates to about half off most of the items in those categories. The place is small and you may have to wait some time if you come during a busier hour. 

I really wish they had some sort of savory waffle. All of their flaps or waffles were some kind of a sweet option.  I really wanted savory but it seemed silly to not take advantage of the happy hour.  I tried their Bourbon apple crisp waffle and a side of sausage patties.  The waffle was smaller than I anticipated and also didn't seem cooked completely through. There was almost no crisp to it so it was a lot softer than I prefer my waffles. Sausage patties were tasty but I wish you got more for the price. I ended up leaving the place still a bit hungry between my two choices.  

One last note is that I don't recommend this place if you are hungover. It's incredibly loud between the music playing and the voices of everyone talking in a small space.  If I were to come back, I'd try one of their savory options like the burrito or Bahn mi.i saw a burrito come out and the portion size certainly looked more like what I expected.   If you're a person who has a sweet tooth for breakfast foods, this spot just might be for you, especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday around 1030.  Easy to get a seat but the place is small. I got the benedicto mexicano, 2 at my table got the burrito, and someone got pancakes. Pancakes good, nothing to write home about. Benedict really good, chorizo was spicy but the eggs were sunny side up which I didn't love.  Burritos looked amazing. I got a side of the root vegetable hash which I could have done without it was pretty much a pile of grease which I didn't expect. Homemade ketchup tasted like BBQ sauce which isn't my style. Service was a little on the slow side which was annoying since the meters out front only allow for an hour we kept having to randomly run outside to re feed them. It sounds like they change the menu often so I'd like to come back and try again. 

I don't understand the small tiny print on the menu that says we discourage cell phone use. I don't disagree with it, but if you're going to discourage it, why is it almost hidden...?"}
{"text":"Jack flaps a breakfast gem in Ohio city. The choices are plentiful and the food is delicious. The pancakes are fluffy, the coffee is great, and the service has always been good.  I also recommend getting the sausage and the root vegetable hash with your meal. 

Note: This restaurant changes up their menu fairly frequently, so if you're someone who gets \"attached\" to menu items just be aware that it might not be there forever!"}
{"text":"5 stars just for offering vegan breakfast options YUM! If only they could get some vegan bacon or sausage on the menu too....

We had some pancakes, waffles and hash that could be \"made vegan\" even though the menu only lists vegetarian options. They were absolutely delicious, and the pricing was good.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'd give it zero if I could.  Congrats on earning the lowest review I've given yet.


Short review:
Overpriced, mediocre food served with 125dB of hipsters. 

Long review:
We visited with a party of 5 on a Sunday morning.
Wait was only about 10 minutes.

Pros:
Our server was pretty nice (other than what's coming in the cons)

Neutral:
Don't come for the decor - it's a concreted box with some kitschy themed art and basic tables and chairs.
If you like to eat while people stare at you as they wait for a table get seated at the \"breakfast bar\" just inside the door.
Everything on the menu has 4 extra adjectives/adverbs.  We get it - your waffles are uh-may-zing. If your food is good it doesn't require superlatives.
EDIT:
I just looked at the photos up for this place - and that was NOT AT ALL what our food looked like.  It was tossed on a plate and tossed on our table - there was zero effort on presentation.

Cons:
This place is LOUD when full.  I'm talking you-better-have-a-pack-of-Halls-for-your-throat loud.  You have to scream at someone next to you - forget about talking to someone on the other end of the table.  2 people in my party barely spoke because it was, well impossible to be heard.  I will say that once a few tables of beards-and-chartreuse-bowling-shoes cleared out it got better.  But initially it was utterly ridic.

The food is far over-priced for what you get.  For $8 I got a \"red velvet\" waffle - slightly larger than an \"Eggo\".  I was expecting something on the scale of Belgian waffle for $8 - NOPE.  It was accompanied by some large glop of what was billed as some sort of \"whipped cream cheese topping\" (as you might expect with red velvet).  It was essentially flavorless (as was the smallish clump of (what I assume was) butter)

I ordered the \"Mexican Coke Bacon\" (actually, 2 orders for the table).  Seriously - f**k trying to be so g0dd@m hipster and just buy and serve decent bacon.  The slices of it that were edible were actually good - but 2 of the slices were PURE LARD.  Seriously - someone in the kitchen cooked and decided to serve 2 slices of fat.  And don't expect it crispy, oh no - that's so yesterday.  You'll get it limp and lukewarm and you'll like it.  And the cold plates used for serving insured that it (and everything else) assumed room temperature nearly instantly.

Sadly - the bacon wasn't the largest atrocity to be placed on a plate in front of us.

My friend also ordered a red velvet waffle. HOWEVER - in her mysterious glop of \"\"\"whipped cream cheese topping\"\"\" was a bread twistie.

Yes - they served her a piece of wire.

Now - I suppose it is POSSIBLE that someone could scoop up a ladle of the mystery glop and NOT see that there's a F**KING 4 INCH PIECE OF WIRE IN IT - but I am dubious.  I seriously think someone simply did not care.

And what did Hipster Flaps do about it?????  WE WERE COMPED A WHOLE TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS.  For one of us nearly eating a piece of wire.

No manager came over and said \"boo\".  The server was apologetic, but not to the degree that should have been appropriate.

Fifty-four bucks (AFTER THE WHOLE $2.50 comp!!!) for 3 people, one of us nearly eating wire - and not even a nod from the person in charge.  EPIC FAIL.

E P I C
F A I L

I hardly think my review will matter (based on all the other gushing over the amazing food) - the ironic glasses and ear-gauge crowd won't care, or will assume I simply don't \"get it\".  And that's fine by me - there's not a snowballs chance in hell that I'm ever gonna be back - so they can have it. The number of great breakfasts I could have had in Cleveland for this money is LARGE.

Managerial staff / owner - if you happen to see this, and you actually happen to care - get a f**king clue on what is an appropriate response when you feed someone refuse.  Tossing someone the equivalent of RTA fare isn't it.

And consider some sound deadening."}
{"text":"Excellent as always.   Great service and excellent food.  One of my favorite places for breakfast.   Sweet and savory options are both amazing"}
{"text":"The service was good. The crawfish and grits were awful. It was very soupy and the flavor was awful. The pancakes were good."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp and grits, real f'ing burrito, the food is good and the place is really nice. It's absolutely a good restaurant to start your day!"}
{"text":"This was such an awful experience. We had come here two years ago and the food was underwhelming. But having a guest who wanted buckwheat pancakes, we decided to give it another try. 
Well, we wish we hadn't. The service was so slow and our food came out separately although there were three of us and we all ordered pancakes.The regular order came out ten minutes before the other two and our friend was long finished eating by the time the two plain orders came out wrong with powdered sugar (I am diabetic) and we sent them back. The eggs arrived before the 2nd round of pancakes and were cold. It was just a bad start to our day. No apologies or reference to their mistakes. We won't be returning again. Decor was super corny and not aesthetically pleasing either. They need a makeover."}
{"text":"We googled best breakfast during our visit here and Jack Flaps popped up first. After walking around weighing out our options we stopped a couple of gentleman and just asked them \"Where's the best breakfast spot around here?\" Immediately they replied with Jack Flaps! So we went and this meal was probably the best of our trip. I order the I'm Basic with a side of flaps and my hunny ordered something similar but he got grits on the side. OMG, first of all, I don't even eat grits but as I'm sitting here writing this review I'm wishing I could taste those grits again! The potatoes were AMAZING, flap jacks even better and my egg over easy was seasoned and cooked to perfection! The service was amazing from both the cook and the server. If you're in Cleveland I would totally recommend stopping by here! It is a smaller place though, so I wouldn't recommend going in a large group."}
{"text":"Used to be great. Service was fine. Coffee was so weak we could barely force ourselves to drink it. (Asked for fresh mugs, hoping it was just the first batch that was terrible, but 2nd try was equally weak). My daughter's Tiramisu pancakes were incredibly dry, almost like a biscuit. The peanut butter whip and whipped cream with my son's Elvis waffle smelled and tasted soured. My husband's crawfish and grits was a joke - a bowl of gravy/roux with a scoop of grits and a single, solitary crawfish. Menu is inventive, but quality has gone downhill. With so many other choices, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place, but the service was abysmal, and the food disappointing.  Breakfast burrito was unevenly cooked, and all the meat was stashed at one end of it.  Pancakes were dry and, quite frankly, boring. \"House-made syrup\" (whatever that means) was runny.  Pork belly (their version of bacon) was just too fatty.

After being seated, we waited over 45 minutes to receive pancakes and a breakfast burrito. We watched other tables that had been seated after us receive their orders, eat, and leave before our food arrived. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I'm not going to attempt to waste my time or yours here, practicing well thought out and witty literary food reviews.  Suffice it to say that if you do like unique, great tasting gourmet pancakes, in a small, trendy yet intimate atmosphere, this place IS 'the bomb'!  We stopped by on a Wednesday morning, hungry from a trip downtown to City Hall, and there was no wait at all.  I ordered the lemon curd pancakes, and my wife the red velvet waffle.  They were utterly delicious, and then some!  The root hash was fantastic as well, especially with a few sprinkles of optional hot sauce.  The coffee was excellent too.  Those complaining that the breakfast was \"too sweet\" should just stay home next time and eat plain oatmeal or melba toast for chrissakes! I am more than happy to recommend 'Jack Flaps', and doubly happy I am supporting a local, 'mom and pop' restaurant business, rather than a faceless national chain!"}
{"text":"Arrived at just the right time this morning to catch a lull and so no wait, right after that a pretty sizable line formed.  

They were able to modify one of the waffles and root veggies hash to make it vegan for my friend.  I had the breakfast bánh mì which was really choice although the fried egg kind of just runs everywhere."}
{"text":"Ya'll just don't understand. I'm bamboozled by the reviewers who didn't rant and rave about Jack Flaps like I'm about to. 

Holy moly, Jack Flaps is everything I've been looking for in a breakfast/brunch spot and more. EXCEPT that it's so dang tiny. When I find myself agonizing over choosing between delicious-sounding (sweet vs. savory) menu options, I know I've stumbled upon a gem. I got something sticky-sweet and delicious from the \"Sweet\" side of the menu, complemented by a friggin Yoo-Hoo iced mocha. Yes, it was as good as it sounds. I ate here over a month ago and I'm still not over it. 

My one life's ambition is to eat here again. ...And again, and again."}
{"text":"Went there this morning after reading the yelp reviews. The food was amazing... Hands down the best breakfast I've ever had. The Kimchi, waffles, french toast, eggs, hash and coffee were all amazeballs!"}
{"text":"First off, this is coming from someone who has never been a big breakfast fan, but I am simply in love with Jack Flaps.
I've always heard about how good Jack Flaps was, but now I got to experience it first hand. To say the least, I was not disappointed at all. The food was incredible, affordable and I'm still talking about it with my friends.
It's about an hour drive to get there, so why in the world would I order one thing?

Happy Jack Waffle: WOW. You wouldn't believe adding hot dogs to a waffle would be delicious, but it's amazing. Our waitress suggested to get it, and we were brave enough to do so and I am so happy we did. The everything bagel cream cheese was the perfect combination giving a cool finish.

Vietnamese-Style Sausage Patties: So delicious! I can't say I've ever had anything like this before and I'm pleased I was able to try it. A delicious amount of spice to not overbear the taste buds, and the patties being thinner was right up my alley.

Real F'ing Breakfast Burrito: There is no lie in the name. It was a real f'ing big burrito. Packed with the adobo-braised beef, the savory burrito was filling but you want to take every last bite. The manchego cheese was a perfect compliment with the scrambled eggs as well.

Breakfast Bánh Mì: EASILY my favorite dish. Our waitress had informed us that this was their most popular dish, and it is easy to see why. I might be biased because I love sandwiches but this was nothing short of incredible. If you have to pick one thing off the savory menu, THIS IS IT!

Next time I go to Jack Flaps, I would love to try the Mexican Coke-Glazed Pork Belly. They were unfortunately out of this when we had went, so fingers crossed it's available next time! I never like to get the same thing twice when trying a new place but it is going to be really hard not to get the Breakfast Bánh Mì. On top of the food being amazing, the service was too. Our waitress was very attentive, kind and helped a great deal when it came to ordering. Forget what you're doing right now seriously, go to Jack Flaps!!"}
{"text":"The food and the service was fantastic!!!!! If you want great food and a wonderful atmosphere.... Jack flaps!!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast option.  Overall smaller place (not a ton of seating) and a focused menu of delicious offerings.  I ordered the lemon pancakes.  They had a lemon topping and the pancakes were solid - not the best pancakes I've ever had, not super moist (which some might prefer).  The coffee was really fresh and delicious.

A bit hard to find - just a tiny sign hanging off the building on the street, and parking is probably not the easiest, but that's typical for Ohio City.  

If you're looking to impress a hipster, good breakfast option."}
{"text":"What a cute breakfast place downtown Cleveland. I got the bacon and eggs and it was the perfect breakfast. The coffee was good too."}
{"text":"Sean and I decided to drop by one weekday morning before going in to work. We'd heard good things and were excited to finally try the place. Now, I will admit, I am not a 'sweet breakfast' kind of girl. I usually don't order waffles, pancakes, or french toast. So I realize that's what the menu is geared toward and that there weren't going to be many savory options for me to choose from. 

However, the recent news that the 'Breakfast Bahn Mi' from this spot recently won best breakfast sandwich from a national publication made me say 'hmmm, maybe this is going to be awesome!' So in we went last Wednesday morning. Sat at the bar with the one other person in the place. Service was prompt and friendly enough at first. I ordered the famed Bahn Mi and Sean went with the lemon curd pancakes. We also got a side of the Coke-glazed bacon to share. 

The good: the lemon curd pancakes were very good - light and fluffy and the toppings were yummy, but nothing that you  can't get elsewhere for just as good and probably less money. But still, quite tasty.

The bad: The Bahn Mi was really not that good. If this is 'America's Best Breakfast Sandwich', we got problems.  The sandwich was too dry for me - the Kim Chi was more like cole slaw. Not much of the tangy, pickled flavor to it at all. The sandwich overall was quite spicy but really without much flavor. When the server asked me what I thought, I (of course) told her the truth and I guess she was surprised since I'm sure she was expecting me to just bow down in the presence of the award-winning dish. 

She tried to talk more about it, and being sort of condescending in the process. 'Have you ever had pho?' Um, yes.....'It's designed to taste like pho'. Huh? Ok......still don't like it. 'It actually also just won Best Breakfast Sandwich in America from x magazine'. Smdh. If I don't think it's all that, and you ask me what I think, I'll tell you. If you only want to hear glowing reviews, just keep a copy of that magazine article handy and read it over and over. Annoying and disappointing. I was tore up all morning from this spicy little number and it wasn't even yummy :/

The nasty: the side of Coke glazed bacon or whatever that was supposed to be was NOT GOOD. Picture some limp, warm easter ham with a goopy mess of slimy, overly-sweet glaze all over it. No. Sorry, that was gross. 

Overall a 'meh' experience that I doubt we'll be running back to try again. There are many other breakfast spots which are more worthy of my dollar."}
{"text":"This is a unique breakfast place in the Ohio City neigborhood of Cleveland. It was awesome! I ordered the raspberry crisp waffle with a decaf coffee. I basically inhaled the waffle. It had toasted almond granola, raspberry coulis, and vanilla mascarpone. I know, sounds fancy. According to dictionary.com, coulis is \"a sauce made with pureed vegetables or fruit and used as a base or garnish. Mascarpone is \"a very soft Italian cream cheese made from cow's milk\". I don't know about you, but I had no idea what those words meant on prior to eating the waffle. Sometimes you just gotta take a chance. We had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. Jack Flaps is a small place, with black and white pictures on the wall. Definitely has a hipster feel in an area that may becoming gentrified. I'm a little unfamiliar with the neighborhood, but that was my first impression. The bathroom signs were confusing. They had pictures on each door, but neither of them clearly displayed a man or a woman. I would suggest they change the pictures. 

Service was pretty good. Our waitress refilled my decaf coffee and checked up on our table regularly. The presentation of the food was also terrific. If you want something a little different than your super basic breakfast, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Dear Jack Flaps
Please note this review is for the Downtown location only:
I really tried to love you, as you know from the 7-8 times I have visited you...but I can't continue this relationship.  Sure, the pancakes and French toast are delish (although portions could be smaller for less waste) but I've been too disappointed to overcome the other important things.  This is truly positive critique as I want you to succeed, even without me:
Salt and Peppa on the table please - Toast should come with the breakfast, not way before or way after (I experienced both options) - Music should fit the time of day, esp in the AM - Eggs are always overcooked, every time - it's important!  Bacon is undercooked/cold, every time.  And smiles from the servers would be nice!   Take these words to heart and I promise success...and perhaps we can give it another try."}
{"text":"Not a wide selection of pancakes/waffles and not a lot of seating. But the service was friendly and fast...even though they brought out one entrée before the other. The atmosphere was nice and I felt at home here. The food was also good too."}
{"text":"First time in! Ann marie was our server! She was fantastic! Helped us make the right food order, great on refills too! Cannot wait to to come back to try more of her suggestions!"}
{"text":"I don't eat breakfast often anymore, but when I do, this is my first choice. I just wish they had bigger locations haha. If you don't mind waiting, the food is definitely worth it. Portion sizes are good and won't leave you hungry."}
{"text":"Seven of us went for brunch Sunday afternoon. 40min wait, which was as expected. The service was fine. The waiter give us two pitchers of water for the table. Refills on coffee was a slow. It took over 20mins for us to get our food, but the place was packed, so understandably. Our order came and was perfect/DELICIOUS. My order was gingersnap cookie eggy bread, very flavorful very sweet! Getting our checks took a long time. Mostly of us paid with cash, getting our change also took a loong time.

I prefer egg dishes (scrambled eggs & hash browns, egg benedict & hash browns, etc), that is not really offered here. If someone suggested Jack Flaps, I would go back but I would not suggest it."}
{"text":"Not really sure where to begin here but my boyfriend and I received the WORST customer service today.  I have been to Jack Flaps quite a bit for breakfast and always rant and rave to people about it but after today I will never go back.  The food is great but I can go get great food AND service somewhere else.  My girlfriend came in from out of town and I took her there. We received the check and it was 50% off so I asked the waitress why and she explained to me how after 1pm everything is half off every day. I was amazed, but it felt too good to be true. So today I called prior to going in and ask the lady on the phone (Courtney H.) if this was still a thing and I specifically asked if the whole menu was 50% off. She replied yes. 

So my boyfriend and I go in.  There was a wait to the door and usually the staff will have complimentary coffee out while you wait and will go around and start a waiting sheet with everyone's name.  The entire line waited there with multiple empty 2-3 people tables open at the bar and another dirty 4 person table open for about 25 minutes before the manager came over to greet the line and ask people how many in their party.  While still in line another lady behind me went to the bar about the complimentary coffee that is usually out for the people waiting and she told me that she had to go up to the bar to ask. With it being 35 degrees today, I could use free coffee to warm me while I waited. 

We finally were seated and I ordered an orange juice and my boyfriend and I ordered 3 things on the menu since we figured it was half off why not try one more thing! Our server Joey was great. We received the bill and noticed only the waffle was half off. Joey was busy so I went up to the bar to explain how I called this morning and the lady I spoke with told me everything was half off. She said yes you spoke to me and agreed that everything was 50% off and said there must have been an error on the check. Then Joey overheard and informed us that only the pancakes/waffles were. So Courtney said \"sorry about the miscommunication but there's nothing I can do\" I asked to speak to a manager.  She said she was the manager.  So I explained to her how you can not tell someone something is half off, they order it, and then try to tell them it's full price and have them pay for that because she (supposedly the manager of this restaurant) does not know the specials and gave me inaccurate information.  She refused to fix the issue. She said \"I am sorry that I told you the wrong information and I apologize for that, but you ate the food so I cannot do anything about it\". IM SORRY WHAT!??!  At this time I did not know her name so I asked her for it because I was so taken back by this response and told her I will be calling back to talk to someone else about this and told her I am leaving this review.  THE MANAGER refused to give me her name. I turned to Joey and asked him her name, she whispered in his ear something and then he ignored me!!!  The ONLY reason I know her name is because I looked on a check from someone she served and her name was at the top.  COURTNEY H. Is what it read and I cannot believe the owner of Jack flaps has someone managing their establishment, being the face of their company who does not know how to manage!  

OH and the icing on the cake is they charged me $2.50 for their complimentary coffee. So I brought that up after she refused to correct the bill to the amount she told me. Her response \"yes it's complimentary but you still drank so yeah we're going to charge you\". WHAT?!!???!! That doesn't even make sense???? It's complimentary but you still pay for it???? How does this manager still have a job?? I've bartended and served in the past so I'm usually very understanding, but this whole interaction was absolutely absurd!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that despite the bad reviews, I'm here to set the record straight!

A lot of the negative reviews state that the menu is just all together way too sweet. Actually, there are about a handful of non sweet things to choose from which is fine with me, along with side dishes to balance out the sugar rush! Bring on the sweetness!

We were slow moving  today, so we didn't make it here until after 1 pm. Lucky for us, between 1pm-3pm all pancakes are only $5, sweet (pun intended)! The place is small there is only about 7 tables, but we sat down right away.

I am a sucker for anything labeled 'red velvet' (I see myself slowly turning into my mother and liking all her favorite things...oh gosh) so I ordered the red velvet flap jacks. They were on the sweet side but that is to be expected! I loved them, the red velvet flavor was strong and I could eat a bowl of the cream cheese whipped cream.

Someone else at our table got the cracker jack flaps, those were good as well. I thought the cracker jacks gave kind of a weird texture but it added to the taste. Someone else ordered the happy jack waffle. I suggest if you don't like a sweet breakfast then you order this. It's a waffle with pieces of hot dog, garlicky greens (heavy on the garlic), and everything bagel cream cheese. At first this combination made me turn my nose but after tasting it I thought 'This works, this really work! I would order this again!\"  Seriously, I would recommend this. 

We also ordered the Mexican coke slab bacon and the root vegetable hash to try as well. Which also balanced the sweetness. The bacon comes in three pieces, perfect to split between the three of us and not feel so guilty about the calorie count.

I subtracted one star because the service was rather lacking. The server wasn't very friendly and service was rather slow. This is to be expected with a new restaurant, but what really bugged me was that the waitress spilled coffee on our table twice while pouring it. The first time she didn't clean it up, and the second time she just brought us napkins to clean it ourselves. That was just odd to us.

Bottom line: I really liked this new breakfast place in Ohio city and cannot wait to come back to try more. This wouldn't be a place I would come every weekend, but for a special treat!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back to Cleveland for more of the yumminess they serve here!  Our new go-to breakfast joint in Cleveland, for sure.  The jackflaps with lemon curd and the pork belly and the Benedicto Mexicano were all winners.  The parties on both sides of us ordered extra food to try amongst them because its so hard to choose just one thing!"}
{"text":"The place is really small so we had to wait for a table, which was fine. It wasn't a long wait as we were there on a Friday morning. I tried the place another time and it was an hour wait... The jack flaps looked amazing, but I wasn't in the mood for sweet so I went for the savory options and opted for the traditional breakfast. It was scrambled eggs with pork belly and root hash. I must say, the root hash was awesome! I would have rather enjoyed sausage instead of the pork belly, but they were all out. It was too fatty for me. The coffee was also really good. It was a local Cleveland coffee that tasted bold and had really good flavor. I even got a cup to go. I would definitely go back and try the sweet jack flaps for my second visit."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy!

I see some people are complaining about how sweet the food was. First of all, I did not think the food was too sweet. Second of all, when you order something like red velvet pancakes, it BETTER be sweet otherwise they're doing it wrong. When has anything \"red velvet\" been savory? Come on people! 

Anyways, in my opinion (which is the only one that matters anyway), the food was ON POINT. It wasn't that crowded when I went (which was on a weekday) so the food came out at a reasonable time. We ordered two pancake dishes, the red velvet and the salty caramel one. Both were incredible. I just want to eat a bowl of that cream cheese frosting they put on the red velvet pancakes. Then we got a waffle with marshmallows, nutella, and graham cracker, which I thought was even better than the pancakes! If you come with a group, I would recommend ordering one pancake and one waffle so you can try both. 

The waiter was super friendly/cute/nice/attentive. Very chill vibes here dude.

Only thing that would make it better is some mimosas to go with my 'cakes. But apparently they're working on getting their liquor license so boozy brunch will become a possibility! I could totally see my hungover self coming back here only to get drunk again.

My favorite breakfast food is pancakes so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The jalapeño flapjacks are amazing! Still trying to figure out how the combination of jalapeño and chocolate tastes so good together-- but it does. Plus getting it for $5 for happy hour -- double the awesome!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it more. Small menu (a+), fantastic coffee, good service. As a bit of a breakfast aficionado, I was truly hoping that this would be the greatness that fills my cleveland breakfast void. I ordered the shrimp and grits and was just overall underwhelmed. The grits had no structure and the bacon sauce just lacked flavor. The shrimp were missing flavor and texture and I was so close to liking it.

My breakfast partner got the burrito and a side of the pork. The adobo beef has some good flavor and the salsas had some good burst. 

I would say that its closer to a 3.5, but I had to temper my excitement and it was closer to a three. The service was solid for a thursday and the prices are very reasonable. For some perspective, most all of the breakfast places (definitely all chains) would max out at 2 on the top end. I'll definitely be back to try some of the sweet items and anything local is much better in my books."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here this morning! My wife and I came in for a late Sunday Breakfast and were seated in about 20 minutes.  From there, our server was quick to help us and the food came out hot and quick.  My wife ordered the campfire waffle and I got the breakfast burrito.  Both meals were delicious!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in Cleveland! Great food, GREAT coffee. Just wish they   were open a little bit later for us late risers! Otherwise Perfect! Thanks"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, for sure going back again. Perfect brunch time spot. I wish there was more room so they could seat more people and actually have a waiting area instead of waiting outside. But the food makes up for it. I recommend the graham cracker waffle or PB&J eggy bread. Definitely getting the real F'ing burrito next time."}
{"text":"Almost everything can be made vegan. The pancakes were delicious fluffy. The Berry compote was amazing. Incredibly nice and attentive staff.  A must stop if costing Cleveland."}
{"text":"Hooray! I got in! Beware, if you come during standard peak weekend brunch time, prepare to wait at least 45 minutes. It's a tight fit regarding table space and available seats. It's a limited menu, but what they have are excellent spins on your brunch expectations. The pancakes are great (although they are pricey, so you might as well upgrade for a bit more for the berry compote of the Guinness chocolate sauce!) and the Mexican Coke-glazed, house-smoked pork belly is a worthy recommendation. I recently had the flavorful Benedicto Mexicano (savory chorizo on airy cornbread!), but the real revelation were the grits with the cinnamon house butter. NOM NOM! I should have ordered another side of it to go!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! Especially for anyone who struggles with a gluten intolerance like me, I was able to get huge, fluffy gluten free pancakes that didn't taste like cardboard! The tiny shop reminded me a lot of something one would find in Portland. My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito which was so good and flavorful that I want to get it next time without the tortilla. Overall, Jack Flaps was amazing breakfast that I can't wait to enjoy again!"}
{"text":"If you're visiting Cleveland or just looking for a hip place to try something new, Jack Flaps should be on your itinerary. 

It's a quaint urban restaurant in which cell phone use is discouraged (you know, so you'll actually talk to the people at your table). Go during slower hours (weekdays after lunch or before lunch but after the breakfast crowd) if you prefer a quieter dining experience. 

Their menu is unique and everything we've tried has been excellent. I love their jack flaps and by better half is a fan of their 'big f' in burrito'. I've been eyeing their eggy bread and will likely try it on my next visit. 

Vegans, vegetarians, and gluten-free patrons will find lots of options on the menu. I have no idea how they managed to make gf pancakes that are fluffy and more delicious than any gluten-ridden pancakes I've had before - magic, perhaps. Regardless, it's always great to find a restaurant that caters to a variety of dietary needs. 

Great food, great place to catch up with friends, lots of unique recipes to try, attentive staff - Jack Flaps earns 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"They took my favorite thing off the menu a while back which was the red velvet waffles. If you are used to \"basic\", traditional breakfast items then this isn't the place for you. This place is for someone who likes to try something new and innovative. Nonetheless, the food items are different and tasty! I would recommend."}
{"text":"We came in on a Friday morning desperately hungry after a long red-eye to Cleveland. There was parking right up front and we were quite pleased by the cozy/clean ambiance, characteristic of a brunch spot. We ordered the Tiramisu Pancakes, the Smoked Peach Waffle (seasonal), and the Real F'ing Breakfast Burrito. The pancakes were truly delicious, fluffy and light, but the espresso custard was a bit too bitter for my liking, which took away from the flavor of the dish. The smoked peaches on the waffle were a little mushy, and the waffle itself was dry. The Burrito, though, was tasty and all of us decided it was probably the best thing on the table. Overall, Jack Flaps is worth a one time visit, particularly due to the unique, quirky setting."}
{"text":"I went to Jack Flaps with a group on Sunday, Sept 6th. I had heard great reviews and wanted to check it out myself. Our group was not disappointed. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals. We did wait for about 20 minutes to get a table, but it was a nice day out so we didn't mind. I'm not sure how waiting in the winter would feel. We had a vegan in our group and true to the information that I had heard, Jack Flaps does have a vegan batter and can alter many of the sweet items. We were told that they can't alter any of the savory items however.

I had the lemon pancakes, and they were delicious! I will definitely be returning to Jack Flaps to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Items Tasted:
Coffee
Pecan Pie Flapjacks - Cinnamon Spiced Pecans, Chili Brown Sugar Syrup, Cereal Milk Whipped Cream
Sweet Punkin French Toast - Eggy Bread with Pumpkin Mousse, Blackberry Syrup, Toasted Pepitas
Croque Madame - Grilled Bread, Pork Belly Ham, Fontina, Bechamel, Fried Egg
Shrimp And Grits - Peppers, Onions, Creole Vinaigrette, Bacon Crème Fraiche
Bruleed Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding - Almond Granola, Berry Compote

Impressed by El Carnicero, in love with Breakfast and unable to make it to Momocho due to their hours it seemed only logical to visit Chef Eric Williams' kitschy breakfast nook, Jackflaps, on Sunday before heading West to Cedar Point, the experience a bit more hit n' miss than the prior day's brunch, though the majority of five plates were still pretty great.

Located on Lorain Avenue and pairing the narrow room to a well-culled menu of innovative fare plus a few monthly specials diners entering Jack Flaps before eight o'clock are likely to find little-to-no wait with the line expanding exponentially as 9:00am approaches, the service a blend of off-the-cuff fun and overall professionalism, a few small questions answered as coffee is filled...and kept full consistently.

Amused by the photographic depictions of Milk in motion and commenting on what a messy photoshoot that must have been it was after perhaps twenty minutes that plates began to arrive en mass from the kitchen, the Shrimp and Grits a competent spin on the Southern Classic with a lot of nuance added by Bacon Crème Fraiche while the otherwise well-made Croque Madame was marred by Bechamel that was slightly over-thickened. 

Moving on to two sweet specials and one item whose order was inspired by brunch at El Carnicero, those fancying Pumpkin will be disappointed to know that the \"Sweet Punkin\" French Toast really tastes nothing like the orange Gourd that it is presumably named, after but instead like aromatic Spices and the included Blackberry Syrup - the \"Pecan Pie\" Flapjacks doing a far better job of rousing thoughts of its namesake while the  torched Rice Pudding may be the best darn version on this side of the Atlantic as shattering sugar gives way to mixed textures of soft grains juxtaposing housemade Granola and fresh Berry Compote."}
{"text":"I would label this place as sort-of Korean fusion breakfast. Wife liked it more than I did, but it was a good experience. We had the Bahn mi, and it was unexpectedly great. My wife loved the burrito and we had sides of the coke-cured pork belly and grits sweetened with cinnamon butter just to try them. Whole breakfast was a reasonable $29. Nothing jumped out as amazing or stellar until I had the coffee.
I used to own coffee shops, tasted pretty much every coffee the world has to offer (yes, even The Kopi Luwak) and this cuppa was a great, great mild blend of some sort.
Go there! I'd give 4.5 stars if I could. Biscuits and gravy on the menu is a requirement to achieve 5 stars."}
{"text":"It's alright. Give it a couple years. If the menu improves, grows, gets more developed, I'll be pleasantly surprised. While it's tasty now, I fear the place is doomed to never evolve and fizzle."}
{"text":"The location is very cute - smaller and cozy.  We had service right away and the menu is so different that the server was very kind to explain what everything was and give us the time needed to make some very careful decisions.  I went with two other people and we decided to order to share so we could get a taste of a few menu items.  We went with the Caramelized Fig Eggy Bread, the Buck Buck Wheat Flapjacks, the Graham Cracker Waffles and the Brûléed Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding.  The portions are huge - we could've been fine sharing two entrees!! If you're starving or a big guy you will not go away hungry!  I wasn't too impressed with the Caramelized Fig Eggy Bread - I think there was too much of a bitter taste from the meat.  I really enjoyed  the Buck Buck Wheat Flapjacks - the cereal milk whip cream is amazing!  The Graham Cracker Waffles are definitely more dessert than breakfast, but so worth the extra calories (just maybe not every visit)!  My sister picked all the Nutella-drenched marshmallows off what was leftover! The Brûléed Vanilla Bean Rice Pudding was my absolute favorite thing I ate!  If I could have this for breakfast everyday - I would be so happy!  I definitely recommend ordering the rice pudding even though the entrees are so big!  I can't wait to go back to try more :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! The interior is very small so it can be a wait but typically the line goes fast. Our server was so great. He was attentive, and offered great suggestions and opinions since the food is unique. 

I ordered the Benedicto Mexicano (their seasonal eggs Benedict) and it was so delicious with a bit of a kick in the chorizo. I couldn't eat all of it! 

My friend and I split the Lemon curd pancakes and they were really great but a little sweet for my taste. 

I tried the burrito my friend got and it was phenomenal - I think they said it's their most popular item. 

My favorite part of the meal was the vegetable root home fries!! They were seasoned so perfectly and had amazing flavor. I suggest ordering a side! 

The atmosphere of the place is incredibly homey and I can't wait to go back. Prices are a bit pricier than your standard breakfast spot, but you pay for quality!"}
{"text":"3 stars because the food was decent but the service was God awful. After the 3 of us sat down at the bar we ordered our food and then they just forgot about us. They didn't bring us any condiments for anything. We had to continue to ask for things feeling like we were bothering the girl infront of us. She seemed so annoyed with us but what are we supposed to do? Go behind the bar and get our own water and silverware?

 I was definitely expecting a different experience. Oh well, my only day in Ohio and I'll make sure if I'm ever back I won't come here."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum extra Yum! Enjoyed the Mexican eggs Benedict that is served on corn bread instead of a English muffin. The corn bread was really good and all of the flavors went really well together. I would order this again. Also had the shredded beef scrambled egg burrito it was also good and had a little kick. Service was good. I liked that there were different options from pancakes (which I have to go back and try), to different Eggs Benedicts, burritos to a regular egg and breakfast meat option. Will be returning forsure!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I got the tiramisu flapjacks and the pork belly. The flapjacks were really good. The pork bellies will live with me forever! I'm craving them. I want them. I want to be them! Quality food and good prices."}
{"text":"Came here today with a group of five. Finally got to try Jack Flaps after so long of waiting. The wait for a table was only around 20 min or so. Happy hour 1-3pm. What a steal. What we ordered: friend 1 - crab benedict; friend 2 - vietnamese bahn mi; friend 3 + bf - happy jack waffles; me - graham cracker waffles. To share: lemon curd pancakes, 2 sides of root hash and 2 sides of mexican coke pork belly. Wasn't crazy for the sides. The mexican pork belly - there was enough for everyone to have two slices each. Thick cuts of greasy bacon - wasn't anything special but it was good - wish it had more of a melt in your mouth pork belly texture though. Root hash was garlicky - wasn't expecting that. Loved the lemon curd pancake - wasn't expecting that either since I don't like pancakes or lemon flavored stuff. I prefer this over the lemon ricotta pancake at Inn on Coventry. Fluffy pancakes but not soggy or too soft like the ones at Inn on Coventry, the custard balanced out the tartness of the lemon and berries. So yummy - this was my favorite. Everyone enjoyed their dishes. I tried the happy jack waffle - reminded me of Happy Dog. Garlicky but savory with little pieces of hot dogs. The graham cracker waffle was also very good - very sweet - I could only finish half of it. Loved the syrup and cinnamon butter that comes with the dish. Reminded me of a s'more. I normally don't like waffles either but these are amazing. Good service too. They were extremely accommodating in splitting the bill in various ways. Only one blunder made was waitress took away our utensils before we were done eating lol. Super cheap - for the two of us without sides was only 12.50$. Sides split amongst 5 people were around 3$ per person. Overall, definitely need to go back when their menu changes. Hopefully they will bring back the red velvet pancakes/waffles, strawberry shortcake waffles, cornbread waffle with pulled pork."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great, buzzing atmosphere. The service was stellar. The food filled me up yet still left me wanting more of those delicious flavors in my mouth. Keep up the good work guys!!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast. I highly recommend you try at least once, but please know there are almost always lines out the door.. so just giving you warning not to show up starving."}
{"text":"After my family and I spent the morning ring the Salvation Army bell in front of a local 5 and Dime and we decided to eat at this establishment. I heard some great things from my hipster friends about how good the food was.  WELL, once again my hipster friends in their tight jeans and dumb hats are liars and must be on the MJ.   I will admit that the food was good, BUT the service is as bad as could be. 

Here is my reasons (in no particular order) that I will never go back here again. 

1) I got there at 10:45 and finally left at 12:45.  That is right, TWO hours to make some eggs and toast.  

2) My family had to wait almost 40min for a table. I am okay with waiting if there are no tables available but there were several tables that were sitting there open but just needed to be cleaned.  The people waiting in front of us cleared their table themselves to help out the staff. REALLY!?!?!

3) I swear the waitstaff that had my section were raised by sloths.  There are 5 people in my family and the waitress brought one plate at a time to the table. By the third trip to the kitchen she for there were two more meals still waiting. We saw her take someone else order and fill someone coffee before my lovely wife flagged her down to get the rest of our food.  You have to be F-ing kidding me. (Don't worry she did have two hands but only chose to use one hand to carry the plates. Have they ever heard of a severing tray?!? Come on!). 

4) It smelled like old cheese in the dinning room and the bathroom smelled like a outhouse.  

5) Never trust a hipster. Never!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here straight from CLE after my red eye landed on a Friday morning around 7:30 AM. After being greeted warmly by Alexandra I sat myself at the bar in the small restaurant with two other tables being occupied. I had already looked over the menu online and had a rough idea of what I wanted. But everything looked good as I kept reading through the menu and I had hard time deciding what I wanted. Thanks to the suggestions of Alexandra, I ordered the lemon curd jackflaps and a side of pork belly.

I was not steered wrong here. The pancakes with lemon curd, graham cracker crust, and berry jam were a nice tart and sweet start to the day (check out the other Yelpers' photos of the pancakes, they're much better than mine due to my lack of lighting). I was also pleased with Alexandra who excused herself mid conversation with another patron to pick up and deliver my food which was just set in the window. The perfect side to the pancakes was the pork belly which was dropped off, still sizzling, shortly after the pancakes. The salty, fatty, smoky pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious.

For 13 bucks and change, this is one of the better breakfasts I've had in a while. No doubt I'll be back again the next time I'm in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Good service, environment and menu to include a nice gluten free selection.  Competitive pricing for everything you get as well.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast.  I wasn't too impressed.  You can tell all of the toppings came out of a can and plopped ontop of the pancakes.  The original pancakes were great.  Buckwheat pancakes were not enjoyable.

On the plus side:  atmosphere is fun.  Coffee was great.  Homemade sausage was the best thing we ordered.  

I think they need to perfect things a little more.  I'll give them another try in 6-8 months to see if there is any improvement."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time. The place had great ambiance and we were seated quickly. I had the S.O.S. with an egg on top- a recommended seasonal item, and it was amazing! The bread was fresh, the hash was zesty and the cream chipped beef was very savory. My friend had the graham cracker waffles which looked (and tasted) delicious. They also have a really great afternoon 'happy hour'- half off waffles! Will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Jack Flaps is a cute breakfast/brunch place in the neighbourhood. 

We arrived on a Tuesday late morning and just skip the breakfast rush to an empty restaurant. The interior is homey and casual. The service was friendly.

We ordered to share:

Original Buttermilk Pancake ($7) crispy outside but soft are fluffy inside

Breakfast Banh Mi ($9) which I enjoyed but the balance of sweet, savory, sour and spicy was a little off but still enjoyable. The colourful elements did make it's instagram worthy!

Jack Flaps is a great cafe if you comfort food prepares with good ingredients and with a small twist."}
{"text":"Giving it a three because if you like sweet you will like it, if you don't you will not as menu items arel limited. Ordered the basic breakfast along wilt a pal who did the same and spilt a waffle with choc syrup  and marshmallows. The basic breakfast of eggs and veggie has were great but both the bacon and vietnamese sausage were left untouched...too fatty and oddly spiced. The waffle was great for a couple bites but not something one could eat as a meal because of how sweet it was. Nice little place, and appreciate their efforts to be different, just need work on their menu I think.  Will not rule them out and will try back later."}
{"text":"I did not have the pancakes or waffles, which, from what I could see looked amazing. I had the Bahn Mi Vietnamese breakfast sandwich which was only fair. My wife had the basic eggs and bacon which was okay. The ambience, however, has the charm and warmth of an empty freight car. I can't quite put my finger on it but it just felt bare and uncomfortable there. And it's not the furniture. It's just the feeling in that space.  If the pancakes and waffles are as good as they look, then I could overlook the atmosphere and character of the space."}
{"text":"I went back and forth between a 3 and a 4 star review - but the food was good enough to push me over.

So we're in town for a wedding and we look for best brunch in the area.  This place surfaces and we agree it's worth checking out.

We pop over and it's about a 30 minute wait.  No big deal.  There's a really nice art store almost next door that has a lot of neat items to peruse.  We're seated and then unfortunately...forgotten for a while.

Our server apologizes as we were apparently out of her field of vision.  I'm a little hung over so I need coffee  as soon as possible.  She takes our coffee orders and we peruse the menu.  I am not sure you can go wrong with any choices.  They are seemed amazing.  My wife chose the Benedicto Mexicano and I went with the Real F'ing Breakfast Burrito and a side of the mexican coke marinated, smoked pork belly.

I down my first cup of coffee quickly and we wait...and wait...and wait for our food.  I also have trouble getting our server's attention for more coffee.  Eventually the food comes out and it is amazing.  The benedict is sunny side eggs, corn bread, and a chorizo gravy.  The cornbread soaked up the gravy quite nicely and added texture to the dish.  I was hoping for a little more spicy from the chorizo, but fortunately they have a house made hot sauce that they'll bring to your table.  So be sure to ask for it.

The burrito is adobo marinated, shredded beef, eggs, and root vegetable hash.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  The hash added some nice body to the burrito.  The egg was hard to find at time and I am not sure added much to the dish.

The porkbelly is essentially a thick cut bacon with a wonderful smoky flavor.  The coke almost tastes like brown sugar which provides a nice sweet and savory balance.

I thought the food was delicious and reasonably priced, but the service needs work.  However, I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"In the movie Cabin Fever, a hillbilly kid jumped off a porch, yelled \"pancakes\" and did some karate moves then bit a man's hand for no reason. That is the first thing that crossed my mind when I came here. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U0-pOeioKY

Most of the menu is pancakes and sweet things but one can enjoy a nice breakfast at a decent price. I went with the hash, sausage and eggs. It was a good choice. MC Young P let me try a piece of the bacon and it was delicious with a great smoky flavor. The coffee in a to-go cup is a great idea that more breakfast spots should offer. The restaurant can be hectic and crowded during the weekend. Townes Van Zandt said we are just waiting around to die anyhow so it should not matter much."}
{"text":"Not good.  Not good at all. 

Pancakes and waffles are made in one of those pancake/waffle makers that flip, not on a griddle.  They also only have a couple of those machines, so the service was super slow.  Although I sat at the counter so I had the [dis]pleasure of watching all the food be made and go past me, possibly skewing my patience.  Coffee was pretty bad...very bad.  

Want pancakes?  Go to Original Pancake House."}
{"text":"Good food. Terrible service. Went here on a Sunday morning. Waited for 20 minutes to be seated, which was fine as it was very busy. When we say we immediately ordered. We then waited for over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. The people who were sat next to us received their food in 10 minutes. No one checked on us. We finally grabbed a waitress and asked where our order was, and it magically arrived. The icing on the cake was when we asked for our check, we didn't get a pen. All in all, good food but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations. For was only ok. Sausages were weird and so was the \"syrup\""}
{"text":"My friends and I went a few Sundays ago for brunch & it was sooo packed! We were really excited to check it out so we we're OK having to wait 30-45 mins. Once we did get seated we got squeezed up front @ a countertop that was a little tight. Opening up the menu was awesome: being able to choose between sweet or savory- pretty much caters to everyones palate! The Banh Mi Sandwich caught my eye but when I went to order our server let me know they just ran out of bagels & couldn't make it. Out of Bagels. On A Sunday... Huh?? I was bummed out but really wanted to try the Vietnamese Style Sausage Patties - I so went with the Old Standard and added those on as the BFast meat. The food took a while to come out - probably just because of the brunch rush! I'm glad I was able to try the sausage patties but overall the rest of the meal was ehh - not bad at all but nothing really special or innovative. But I guess the name Old Standard kind of relates that sentiment anyway :) I'll for sure go back because I still do really want to try out the sandwich & something on the sweet side too!"}
{"text":"Good food! Awesome spot to get some interesting things on their menu. I always get their Biscuits and Gravy!"}
{"text":"WHY JACK FLAPS, WHY?!?!?!?!

I was rooting for you! And you let me down! Missed the shot at the buzzer kind of let down. Being handed the menu these words left the waitresses mouth \"so we are out of a main ingredient for most of the dishes so I would suggest you don't order them, get a waffle or something.\" What ingredient might that be? You, as a king breakfast place ran out of the main breakfast ingredient, the one and only, THE EGG.

No eggs benedict, no scrambled, no fried, no bahn mi topped with fried egg, no breakfast burrito, no old standard, no sunny side up! Nada! Nothing! No Huevos! 

This case of the missing egg happened at noon which means there was 3 more hours of serving time. If I was working in this establishment, I woulda hopped across the street to the grocer and bought some eggs. I know there might be some rules with going through the distributor or what not but come on guys! A breakfast place without eggs! It's like a pizza place without cheese, a hot dog place with no buns, Chinese without rice! IT\"S LIKE SOME GREEK TRAGEDY! It just doesn't make sense. Its defying the laws of the food universe. But, I got the feeling that the staff could truly care less about the kidnapped egg. It appeared that they had already mentally checked out for the day, nonchalantly suggesting people order anything without eggs.

So I sat there, starring at the pictures of men getting pelted and dripped on by glorious eggs, while solemnly eating my egg-less breakfast."}
{"text":"My first time here was a weekday in the door at 7am just as they opened. We were of course the first here, though another couple entered as we were paying and leaving. 

Our server was friendly and on top of things. The kitchen was fast in preparing more complex than average breakfast dishes. 

My friend got a decadent looking waffle piled to high with mini marshmallows. All waffles can optionally be made gluten-free through the use of buckwheat batter which my friend said left a little to be desired and was porous in consistency. The \"GF\" logo all over the menu does not denote the dishes original state, but that the dish can be customized to be gluten-free. 

I got the most creative breakfast item I have had anywhere in Cleveland: breakfast banh mi with Vietnamese sausage, a fried egg, and breakfast kimchi (which can be ordered separately as a side). The menu description was a bit confusing to me but the waitress explained the \"everything bagel cream cheese\" was a flavored cream cheese and that no bagel is involved. The food is served on a baguette as a sandwich. I ordered it without cream cheese, took away the baguette and ordered a side of the root vegetable has instead.  

Parking is street only and there are meters on the entire long block this restaurant is located on. The good news is these are the cheapest meters in town and $0.25 gives you an hour!"}
{"text":"Stopped in right as they opened on a cold Saturday morning in January. Was greeted warmly by our server who was quick to make a personal connection with us as we sat at the bar. Had great service the entire time; it was fast, too, especially considering we came in right as they opened. 

Food:
-the coffee is, as everyone says, great
-Tiramisu jack flaps: thick pancakes, not overly sweet, and complimented perfectly by the whipped cream and toppings
-Benedicto: everything about this amazingly spicy and delicious dish is incredible. The jalapeño corn bread, the crema, it was all outstanding. 
-the pork belly... THE PORK BELLY  enough said
-the grits- amazing with or without the cinnamon butter side
-the syrup: spiked with cinnamon and delicious.

Overall great experience, amazing food, wonderful breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here FOREVER. We've tried a lot of times, but the line for a table is always out the door and down the street on the weekends.... and understandably so. After bidding at the Sheriffs Auction on a townhouse didn't quite go our way, we ended up at Jack Flaps on a Monday morning ready to drown our problems in some pancakes. 

The inside was adorable, the design was just whimsy enough to still be modern. The staff was helpful and upbeat and the menu was awesome. I was a little bummed that they were out of the kimchi for the bahn mi, but I ended up with the lemon curd pancakes and they were perfection. Sweet without being overly sweet, perfectly cooked and hit all the right taste buds. My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito (which of course I sampled) and it was awesome, too! I couldn't believe he ate that entire thing in one sitting. 

Moral of the story, either find your inner patience on the weekend, or take the morning off. Either way, make a point of eating here. So. Delicious."}
{"text":"The name jack flaps implies a promise of pancakes, a treat I only reward myself after long runs and during holidays.  I excitedly stood in line at this tiny, minimalist Ohio City space.  The place seemed short staffed taking a while to turn a vacated table. The online menu was promising and there were specials to boot! All in all the coffee and company were great but I was underwhelmed by \"root vegetables,\" that were just salty home fries.  I was pleased to have only ordered one pancake as it was very cakey (1.5 inches thick on the middle) and dry to the point butter and syrup could not save.  Maybe it was an off day."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Tucked in a small area down in Ohio City it is quite the find. I had one of their eggy toast with a jalapeno syrup and it was delicious. I also had a side of grits that were not bad (I'm from the south so I am always skeptical about grits in the North). The coffee was great and the service was awesome. The place is small so you will want to get there early. Although it is small the turnover is pretty quick so don't let that deter you. It is definitely worth the wait.I  will be back to this place soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to grab breakfast in Ohio City. The breakfeat burrito is my go to but you can go wrong with anything I tried on the menu (that's damn near everything).  Just want out for a wait on Saturday and sundays because it can get out of hand."}
{"text":"Mediocre. I expected more outta this place especially after reading reviews and having a monster appetite from a little bit of too many patron shots the night before. It's not as good as I would have liked. The food was not spectacular and I kept an open mindset even when trying a bite off each of my friends entrees. I ordered the Mexican bendicto which had jalapeño cornbread, eggs, chorizo, spices etc. jalapeño is spicy. Cornbread should be honey buttered sweet. The combination when both ingredients collide should be a fiesta in my mouth. It was not. It was a boring lecture of chemistry. The cornbread was so crumbled and tasted like bread crumbs. 

I get the concept and marketing in this establishment and I see a lot of creative minds gathered at the table to create a great brunch atmosphere but the thought needs to be more centered on the quality of each entree. I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"I love breakfast foods and I'm so glad I got to try this place. The food here is reasonably priced. Interior is very modern and cozy with tons of natural light coming through the windows. My friend had the real f-ing breakfast burrito and I had the lavender crunch waffle. They were both very very good. The burrito comes stuffed with meat, cheese and other things. Was flavorful with a slight spicy kick. The lavender crunch waffle was also delicious. It comes topped with toffee pieces for the crunch as well as blueberry compote. I don't know how to describe how it tastes so go try it for yourself cause you will not regret it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was not fairly busy when I went, however the service was not very attentive or kind. Food was fairly overpriced for what you were given and coffee was decent."}
{"text":"Jack Flaps is a mega cool eatery in Cleveland. Rusty and I went there for a late brunch while we were in Ohio, and were greeted with friendly service and delicious eats. Really affordable too.

The place is pretty small, seating maybe only 20 people or so at a time. Because we were on the late end of their service though, the place wasn't too full. We got two coffees to start, and pointed at the cool photos on the walls -- pictures of the owner and other members of the staff getting smacked with eggs. 

They were out of a few things, but we settled on the Graham Cracker Waffle, the Lemon Curd flaps and a side of the pork belly. Everything was so delicious! The Graham Cracker waffle was every smores lovers dream, and the lemon curd flaps were equally amazing. 

The kicker: When we got our bill, we thought the waitress must have made a mistake. It seemed like we were charged too little. Looking at their website now though, all flaps and waffles are $5 between 1pm and 3pm. That's a steal!

This place is a must visit for brunch or breakfast if you're in the Cleveland area. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here on recommendations from fellow gluten free eaters. I ordered the tiramisu pancakes. They were good...not fantastic, but for gluten free, I was happy. I wish the restaurant were bigger, waiting at the entrance is grueling"}
{"text":"I stopped by Jack Flaps for lunch with some friends. I wasn't impressed by the variety of options, but I was impressed with what I ordered. I ordered the Real F'ing Breakfast Burrito ($10). It was enough to feed two people and it was the perfect \"brunch\" meal.

I would go back again, but I am not in any rush."}
{"text":"Met some out-of-town friends here for brunch on Christmas Eve and couldn't have been happier with our decision. Place is a little small so you'll probably have to wait during peak brunch hours, but there were plenty of seats at the counter for us. Service was great and food was excellent. Everyone loved their food, we almost all ordered the burrito, but I opted for the Fat Elvis which was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was really good, especial the Vietnamese sausage and the pork belly soaked in Mexican coke (haha). The service was friendly and the coffee was tasty. I would go back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I generally love everything that Eric Williams touches.  So, I maybe don't love Jack Flaps, but I do like it a good deal?  

We arrived and sat at the bar, ordering a coffee and water.  The coffee was good.

Then we got the Crab Benedict and the Malty Granola Pancake (I forget what it's called).  The Crab Benedict was full of fresh crab and a heavy roulade sauce.  My roulade, it's actually a roulade and not a spicy cream like most people serve.  I found the sauce a little overwhelming for the delicate crab.  I also found that since it wasn't served on bread, it was surprisingly not very filling.  Overall it was pretty good though!

As for the flapjack.  It tasted more like dry cake than flapjack and it was covered in overly sweet sauce and sweetness.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.

Overall, I love the idea of getting brunch food at times that aren't brunch.  At the same time, the service was incredibly slow (sorry, but I saw the chef cutting bananas and it took forever to cut a banana!  The kitchen needs to work on their knife skills).  In addition the menu was wayyyyy too sweet.  I'm not a sweet tooth person so I was limited to about three things on the entire menu.  Not a single savory waffle/pancake?  I can't do candy store in the morning, and that's what a lot of the menu consisted of.   I'm sure I'll be back, but as there are growing breakfast options and good ol' hardy diners around, I'm in no rush."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food and nice people. Service a bit slow but during circumstances (full house) it was fine. 

Recommended for sure"}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland and was recommended this place. We did not order any of the pancakes. Nothing on the menu really excited me besides eating a bunch of carbs. I got the breakfast plate that was okay. The potatoes weren't that great and i feel like it's hard to mess up potatoes. Just felt like this restaurant wasn't that great. The orange juice tasted like It was from concentrate. The only thing that was good was the country sausage which had a bunch of flavor and was salty (i like salty thankfully). 

The service was good just not my favorite brunch spot."}
{"text":"I took my friends from the UK to this restaurant this past week. I had been raving about it because of prior experiences. Unfortunately this visit was NOT the same experience as previous times. It was freezing cold in the restaurant, when we asked to turn up the temperature we were met with a sour response. My friend got the best f-ING breakfast burrito-which she was enjoying until she bit into a shard of glass. When we told the server she said that was the second time her table had glass in their food. The manager never even bothered to come to the table to apologize or express concern. I was very disappointed to say the least and will not be returning. If you eat here proceed with extreme caution!!!"}
{"text":"I thought this was good a good place - although it is small, making it very crowded on weekends.  Coffee was just ok - I was expecting something rich and wonderful to go along with my pancakes.   I have to say their original pancakes are probably in my top 5 ever...  Check this place out."}
{"text":"Very very good food. More sweet options than savory, but that's why we chose it. Only at brunch can you get away with basically eating dessert without any other entree. The waffle, pancake, and egg bread selections were great. We had the s'more waffle and the rootbeer float egg bread. Definitely sweet. Definitely delish. Service was friendly. We waited almost 40 minutes despite that they estimated a 15-20 minute wait when we got our name in. But it's a small place, you can't always control movement. I would go back, especially because it seems their menu changes frequently (a lot of what I saw on yelp was not available on the menu). Oh, and if you arrive close to 1, hold your horses and ask them not to put in your order until happy hour, which is 1-3 and offers $5 waffles and flapjacks!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this place was amazing and fast and absolutely delicious. They're fast, kind, and I can genuinely say it was the best breakfast my fiancé and I have ever had. He's never rated anything over a 7, and he gave this place 9/10. I vote 104483939393939933/10. WOW. 

Come here.

Seriously. 

Heaven on earth"}
{"text":"The f'ing breakfast burrito is amazing. Also had the seasonal special lavendar waffle equally amazing. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Finally a cool hip gourmet type of breakfast spot! Great food and veg hash is great! Pork belly was good af!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Jack Flaps in Ohio City and its Downtown location a handful of times now and have always ordered the same thing: The Real F'ing Breakfast Burrito. Not only does it have a cool name, but it NEVER fails to disappoint. After the third or fourth time I was worried it might lose its \"wow factor\" but NOPE. Still goin' strong as my absolute favorite brunch item in CLE, hands down. The Adobo-braised beef really gives the burrito its top-notch flavor and kick. The hash stuffed inside the tortilla along with the scrambled egg and tomato salsa is also a delicious addition. Top it all off with crema, cheese, more salsa, and jalapeños for absolute perfection. Move over, Denny's! This is the real Grand Slam of breakfast."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food.
We had the burrito and tiramisu, would highly recommend both.
The service was professional and friendly.

Ambience could improve just a bit, and they should really offer Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Being a lover of pancakes, I was interested to try this place. Stopped in on a Sunday morning, and was surprised at how small the joint was. Luckily, we found two spots up at the bar, and were greeted right away. The server was very friendly and eager to introduce us to their specialties. We ordered coffee, (which was mediocre) but the do automatically give it to you in a to go cup so you can take your coffee home with you if that suits your fancy. 
Their menu has a sweet side and a savory side. Most of the menu items on the sweet side didn't interest me, since from what I could tell they were loaded with marshmallows and syrup which isn't really my thing. I instead ordered the Palookaville Benedict, two eggs served atop cornbread with pork belly and a chili-type mix in between. My companion ordered the Currantly Winter, a buckwheat waffle with red currant compote and a sweet crumble served on top. The food was served in a timely fashion, and was a good portion size. The server had recommended the hash to go along with my benedict dish, but I opted against ordering this since I probably wouldn't have been able to finish both. 
The Palookaville Benedict was a good combination of flavors, but I did feel like the chili combination was similar to the taste of manwich, which was sort of overpowering and off-putting. My companion's waffle was also good, but again, overpowered by the compote. 
The server mentioned that Jack Flaps was an innovative take on breakfast, but I didn't necessarily see anything here that was innovative or especially creative. In my opinion, the flavors are one-note, and nothing you couldn't easily find at neighboring breakfast joints. All in all, certainly not a bad meal, but nothing to write home about and probably wouldn't go out of my way to recommend to others."}
