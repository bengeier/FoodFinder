{"text":"One of my favourite bars in Toronto. Outstanding beer selection that offers all the important and outstanding beers from across Ontario. I've heard criticisms of the service here before but have never experienced this at all. Maggie the bartender is one of the city's best with a kind smile and snappy service to go with it. 

A great place to hide from the city down below especially in Winter."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to C'est What? about 5 years back, and it became my instant favourite bar in the city. If you've been to Bier Markt, C'est What is the same...but totaly different. Whereas Bier Markt offers beer from pretty much every country in the world, C'est What is all local micro-brews, all the time. Steamwhistle is probably the only major label brand they carry, and even that is brewed just down the street.

Staff are super knowledgeable, so don't be intimidated. If it's your first time with micro-brews and don't know what to order, just tell them what you normally drink and they can bring you something comparable. If you want to try something different, they are happy to make suggestions. I've seen this time and time again - these guys know their stuff.

Oh, and the food is great too. Excuse me, I hear a pint of Dead Elephant calling my name."}
{"text":"Shame on me for continuing to go to this place even though the experience is terrible every time. Aside from a decent menu (if they ever actually let you sit at a table) all they really have going for them is their \"great selection\" of Ontario Craft Beer. We have long since realized that we can get the same (or better) beer for a better price in at least three other bars in Toronto (Hint: The Only Cafe, Victory Cafe, The Rhino, or even Bar Volo).
We have had continuously rude service at this place. The hipsters they staff are not knowledgeable about the beer, yet somehow feel they can be smug to their patrons (who in our case are actually brewers at OCBs). They also seem to be hung up on having the perfect number of people at each table, which makes it almost impossible to get a table in a timely manner. Even though they have plenty of seating throughout the establishment, they won't seat people at any table where there might be an extra chair. Once on a very slow night our party of six was asked to move to a different table because our table had seven chairs.
The final straw was the last time we went there, when we waited nearly two hours for a table because we had nine people. We came into the bar around nine thirty and even though we offered to break up into smaller groups, they didn't seat us until after eleven thirty. When we were finally seated, it was in a room that had several other empty tables. We had been waiting so long to eat dinner--I personally hadn't eaten in seven hours--that we scarfed down our food with water (because we couldn't drink anymore on empty stomachs) and then went home to bed. On top of everything, our food was dry and overcooked in what seemed like a poor attempt to make up for our wait by getting our food to us quickly.
After three years and many horrible nights, I vow that I will NEVER go back to C'est What. Save yourself the trouble, and follow my lead.

(Yes, I posted this on urbanspoon under the username smamw as well, but I'm trying to save people from going there)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem literally.
Hidden in a basement on the busy Front street is this casual atmosphere place with a very interesting menu.
After eating for days at places with same old boring menus we found the menu here to be a welcome relief. The service staff was jovial and make it a friendly place to hang out for hours with your friends. 
We did not have a chance to try all the local brews but the ones we tried were more like half-way decent stuff.
Maybe next time I will have better luck with the brews."}
{"text":"Good job with this beer joint.  Food was good and I liked that they only served Canadian micro brews.

Very nicely done."}
{"text":"\"can I get a pint of Keiths please?\".................\"Try again\".

I went to C'est What for the first time last night and thoroughly enjoyed myself!!

The place is essentially a large spacious basement with many rooms, but very quaint and cozy, with a super chilled out feel to it. The food was amazing and the beer selection was great. 

They have an extensive list of beers on tap and in bottles, majority of them starring micro-breweries which is so awesome and such a great change from the world of Stella and Keiths!!!!! 

We sat at a closed off fire place on comfy couches and carpets, and didn't move for 3 hours besides the much needed 20-odd bathroom breaks!!! We all got a variety of beers... The Hemp Ale one was my favorite! The pumpkin ale was delicious as well. 

The veggie burger is delicious, as are the sweet potato fries that are actually \"yam chips\"... essentially sweet potatoes sliced into 'crisp' shapes' ....evidently sweet potato anything is my weakness!!!!!!

Great place to hang out and try good beer :)"}
{"text":"Good thing to have so many beers and eats and great sweet potato fries. Good memories from years ago hearing live jazz there. Very comfy, downtown, and friendly in a neighborhood which is near to lots."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Tried the Buffalo (Bison) Burger. I've eaten bison before and found there's to be a bit dry however my boyfriend gobbled up the whole thing so it obviously wasn't bad! The herb frites that accompanied it was also great. That night they had a cranberry cider on tap. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in toronto. I worked near by, sent and still send all the tourists and beer lovers there. The service is friendly, food is great, there's a great tap selection, and prices are fair. It has a great atmosphere-is especially cozy in the winter, live music anlevel headed security. If you haven't been, deff keep'er in mind!"}
{"text":"Great, cozy atmosphere in this place!  If you're a lover of beer you'll love it here. Their spicy Moroccan stew was delicious but I wasn't so much a fan of the appys we had."}
{"text":"I go here as often as possible. Probably at least 3 times a month.
- Beer selection is great, all kinds of everything to try
- Food is really good quality, served fast, and at a great price.
- Service is generally very good.
- Always busy enough that there are people around to talk to, but you can always get a seat."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Great after work and weekend crowd. Close to lots of great bars, restaurants and entertainment options in the St. Lawrence Market district. Be sure to try the Lamb Burger, mmmm mmm good!"}
{"text":"I was taken to lunch as a treat to C'est What (pronounced 'Say' What?, for American readers).  Who can grumble about free lunch?  Certainly not I.  With that being stated, would I come here on my own?  Probably not.

The restaurant/bar is downstairs, which does in fact add to its ambiance.  However, the attraction stops there.  I mean, the decor is certainly passable as indicated by the smattering of people and families about for lunchtime.  However, there is no distinctive flavoring or flair.  A pool table rests in the backroom.  A fireplace with a circle of couches resides near the entrance.  A bar, much like a legion hall bar, occupies the right of the main room.  With a play-on-words restaurant name, I expected more in terms of clever, class, or at least kitsch.

The bartender was doubling as our server.  This lasted for the first round of drinks.  When my friend asked for a water, a coffee, AND a beer, she was told to order the beer later.  Okay.... but then the bartender/server never returned until after our food was almost completed.  The back server ended up taking our orders.

I ordered the vegetable roti.  It was okay.  The roti shell was crumbly and farinaceous, leaving my palate a bit mealymouthed.  On the upside, my friend's shepherd's pie looked delicious -- especially the lush covering of cheese.

All in all, we ordered two dishes, a coffee, a hot tea, and one beer for a total of about $40 before tip.  Would I come here again?  Sure... if I was with a group of people that wanted to go.  On my own?  I'd probably pass."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere a lot, but that could be because I was with a big group of friends and we had a great time. The only thing is that a beer and a sandwich set me back 25 bucks, which I thought was a bit much. Sandwich was a pulled pork (bland but totally saved by the sauce) concoction on a baguette. Their sweet potato chips that came on the side were so good I barely got to eat any. My friends finished them for me before I could say much, lol. Good place, lots of fun."}
{"text":"If beer is your poison, then this should be one of your go-to destinations in the city. Tremendous tap selection, including casked ales. The ability to purchase sample sizes is clutch, and affords you the chance to try many different beers. 

The kitchen delivers as well. The cheese fondue and jambalaya are solid. Menu is kept small, and your attention should be on selecting what beer you're going to drink.

Service is a little slow, and decor is a little dated, but you definitely gotta come here."}
{"text":"I love a good pun and I love beer, so I had high hopes for this subterranean bar on Front Street.  Unfortunately it's one of those microbrew fetish places; nothing you'd recognize and most of the beers just aren't that good.  Didn't try the food.  The atmosphere was better; like a college bar but not in a bad way; seems to draw a laid-back crowd and I made some new friends here.  There are four full-size pool tables (pay by the hour) and a dart board, and live music of the moody, coffee house variety (someone was doing Dylan covers when I was there).  It's a big underground place that sort of resembles the rec room in some house from the 70's.  Lots of blond wood."}
{"text":"I have always love the casual atmosphere and great selection of beers on tap. Winter has the fireplace working and sit on the couch. Perhaps play some pool with friends and listen to life music when it's available. You also have the option of chilling at the bar and not get distracted by others when I am catching up on some online work via tablet. Burgers or the roti are my favorite food selection to eat there."}
{"text":"The stars are for the craft beer lineup and the pleasant decor which have always been good.  I've gone here on occasion if I'm in the area, for years.  However, I'm done with it.  Every time I go, the service is sullen-faced and miserable.  I can't imagine what might happen if I had neophyte beer questions, which I don't.  It seems that being civil is now uncool.  When and an acknowledgement \"hi\" and a \"thanks\" at the end is all done by the customer, something's wrong.  Thankfully these days there a plenty of places to enjoy rotating taps and craft brews."}
{"text":"Nice place, good local beers, very decent food.  Staff is sometimes grumpy but mostly nice. 

A good place to meet with friends!"}
{"text":"If you want to feel like you're eating average food in a ski lodge in downtown Toronto C'Est What may be what you are looking for.  If you want all of that and good service too, I would keep looking for somewhere else to host your ares ski parties."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years whenever I feel like a good beer but am not dressed up. It can sometimes be hard to get a seat but I'm there for the beer selection."}
{"text":"For me, C'Est What? is one of those go-to, default places that has forever earned a place in my heart.  Even if I omit a few cherished memories associated with this place, the following impressive list of positives still remains:

LOCATION - Very central.  Easy to get to if you're a downtown person (which I am - even though I actually live in midtown, I work and play primarily south of Bloor).  Though easy to get to, the place is very easy to miss: it has a small sidwalk footprint, and if you're just walking by, you're unlikely to be drawn in.  However, once you do find yourself here, be careful - this place might turn you into a regular!

VIBE - Everything seems to be just right, exactly the way it's supposed to be: the fireplace, the pool tables, the brick walls, the small acqurium decorated with an empty beer bottle (Steam&Whistle?  I forget... not very observant, huh?)  I must be biased after having come here so many times, but this is the closest a bar has ever felt to home.  I try to avoid it whenever they have live music, but it might be your cup of tea.

SERVICE - When I read reviews, I often come across complaints about the service at C'Est What.  However, I personally have rarely had an issue with them.  Once or twice I've been sort of ignored after coming in and sitting down, but as irony would have it, I was waiting for my boyfriend both of those times, and I did not really want to order anything before he arrived anyway.  And any time I did want to order something, the servers appeared promptly.  Mindreaders, perhaps?? :-)  And I don't think I'm enough of a regular to warrant any kind of special treatment: sometimes I spend a year without setting foot into the place... but I always come back eventually.

BEER - This is where the place really shines.  The vibe, the decor, the service would mean nothing, if this place did not have the substance (i.e., the microbrew selection).  This is what really makes it special and sets it apart.

FOOD - The food is just passable.  I've had far worse in pubs, and I've had far better.  I still give C'Est What? a 5-star review - because if, on top of everything else, their food was awesome too, I'd have to hack into yelp's servers, modify the scripts to allow me to give them six stars. :-)"}
{"text":"When the weather gets too hot for me, and I'm desperately craving beer, this is where I head.  The basement hideaway is perfect for cool relaxation.  Plus, their selection of beer is always changing and never mundane.

I don't go there for the food (though the menu isn't bad), but for the beer. 

The wait staff can be a bit scattered at times, fair warning."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am a beer nerd and had trouble finding anything but lagers and macrobrews in Canada. I went into C'est What thinking this was Canada's last chance to woo me, and boy did they ever. They have a wonderful selection of local craft beers as well as some nice imports. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. The fellow serving my buddy and I recommended and excellent IPA and when I asked him to bring the next best one they had, he brought me a beer not on the menu that he brewed himself, it was wonderful. The server then gave me a list of the other fine brewpubs in town and they were all home runs. 

Oh yeah, the food is great too. My buddy had the butter chicken and I had the chicken tandori sandwich that I switched sides on to get the locally sourced roasted beets. The chicken was tender and juicy, the tandori sauce spicy and flavorful and the beets were heavenly. If I'm in Toronto again, this will be a must visit spot for me."}
{"text":"Chill. Great for conversation. Pool. Dank (in a good way). Real food. Great brew. Swing thru."}
{"text":"We had the butter chicken poutine. It was fantastic. Great service and relaxed atmosphere.  Good beer selection too."}
{"text":"Came here late one night with a large group. Tables were all occupied, but we were still able to find a spot by the bar to gather around. Plenty of space in the restaurant I noticed for big groups if you're able to come at a good time to grab a table. 

Good selection of beers on tap, and menu seemed like there were a lot of \"comfort\" food type options. Some of what we ordered  were sweet potato chips and calamari. Chips were good, calamari was less than average. My friend's chicken wrap was good as I was told. 

Food was brought out with good timing, and drinks the same way. Service was average and as expected from being at a casual restaurant. 

The only annoyance of our experience at C'est What was with one of male bartenders that served us occasionally. He seemed to favour being sarcastic with his service responses. And that's perfectly fine, we appreciate fun sarcasm but his sarcastic replies weren't helpful nor were they in good humor. Being sarcastic doesn't mean that it's a free pass to be rude. 

All in all, wouldn't mind coming back here for a casual drink or bite to eat. Just avoid sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"My friends and I always venture down to C'est What for a good pint and some yummy bar snacks, but I always leave wondering why we come here so often. 

The food is good, I do like their selection, they have falafel's, nachos, moroccan stew, veggie burgers and their beer selection is to die for. 

My problem is always with the service, it's definitely not a place to go if you're in a rush, or are even planning to go somewhere else after. I usually have a very uninterested waiter who will take one persons order and leave - slowing down the whole process and just incredibly frustrating. 

All in all its an okay place to spend a relaxed 'laissez faire' evening, but I'd only recommend going if you're into beer - if not - Les Papillon is next door and the food is much more decadent."}
{"text":"Joan was awesome, and helped me out with lunch selection. I would definitely recommend this place. It's casual, yet very luxurious. The low lighting gives it a relaxing and romantic vibe. Great beer choices, all local.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"C'est What is one of Toronto's hidden treasures.  They have a beer selection comparable to Volo or Beer Bistro, but with much more reasonable prices and a very cool atmosphere.

Hidden below the street with a modest entrance upstairs is a large and excellent space with a cozy feel, a functional stage, pool tables and two well-stocked bars.

The food here is always excellent, and it's not just pub fare, you can get roti, thai curries, peameal on a bun.  It's all reasonably good, and most dishes come with C'est What's legendary frites.  They also have excellent vegetarian options including a Moroccan Stew that is fantastic.

C'est What usually has a solid crowd, but you can go almost anytime for dinner and not wait for a table.  It's also a great place to go with a group.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great little spot.   Cozy and fun.  Great place to listen to music.  

Awesome staff, great menu (more then one option for vegetarians), great crowd, microbrews and great wine list.  

Love it there"}
{"text":"Craft brew at its best.  Something for everyone.  Staff know their stuff too which is helpful if you aren't too sure what to try. Don't get your heart set on something specific from the menu though... they might not be carrying that one today."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers on tap and on cask, though be warned the  cask ales may be very under - carbonated compared to their bottle versions. The food is decent though nothing to write home about. Ask the bartender for their best IPA or stout selection."}
{"text":"Lovet his place. 
Great beer selection and awesome staff, food is cheap and delicious.

Nothing more to say other than everyone should come here.

Oh, but if you're with a crappy cell phone provider you probably wont get service due to it being in a basement."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere. But if you're coming to have a conversation, stay away from the live music area as it's so loud! Decent selection of food. 

Some of the staff can be a bit nicer/knowledgeable. We booked a 4 person table, but we ended up having a 5th person and just put in an extra chair. Apparently it's restaurant policy to not accommodate a 5th chair. When asked why, the waitress said she doesn't know, but it's just their policy. I would be glad to if it's a fire exit safety issue, but I wasn't sure what the problem was because there was a lot of space to fit in one extra person. 

Our other waiter was awesome though. Very friendly and joked around. He made some good recommendations for drinks!"}
{"text":"Oh I think I like it.

When I saw all the beer selections, It just complete me, not because I'm alcoholic, but because they really have good selections. Not only that they are good, they are all domestics and representing the local hoods.

They're stouts are no Guiness, but the St. Ambroise from Quebec and Black Katt from Pickering ON were definitely enjoyable, rich and definitely black and beautiful. 

If you like Keith's Pale Ale you'd like their Al's Cask Ale. It has a good enough citric flavour that keeps it pale ale but doesn't make you feel like you're drinking some citric flavoured beer. Speaking of citric flavoured beer, I ended the night with a pint of Orange Peel Ale, it was good, that's all I got.

Although, I am not impress of the food menu, food wise and menu lay out wise. The selection was ok, but definitely could be better. The lay out itself hurt my eyes, that after 2 minutes of looking at it I decided not to order food. Seems like it was designed with the first version of Paint using Windows 98. 

I like the atmosphere, very laid back and relax, just like the staff. It wasn't that busy, so I'm not sure how the laid back, relaxed staff would perform on a busy night. Enjoyed the pool tables and the couches, nice touch on the fireplace too.

Good beer, good times and more good beer."}
{"text":"My work colleague and I went to C'est What on Thursday, December 8th, 2016 for after work drinks and a meal. Although the place was busy at around 5:40PM or so, we were seated almost immediately which was great. 

Food

I ordered the butter chicken poutine which consisted of Frites, butter chicken, cheese curds, almonds, and diced green onions. I requested no almonds on mine as I am not a fan of them at all. The cost of the poutine was $13.

My friend also ordered the butter chicken poutine and both of our orders came out within about 5 minutes of ordering, which was pretty fast I must say. It must have been pretty fast, because, the waitress apologized for it coming out so quickly.

I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed with the portion size of the butter chicken poutine relative to the price that was paid. The sauce was plentiful and had a good kick to it and there was a lot of chicken. However, I really dislike the fact that the cheese curds were not really mixed into the poutine. Instead, the majority of them were push off to the side.

Other than the issue above, the poutine itself had a good taste. But, I wouldn't have paid more than $10 for it.

Drinks

The beer selection at C'est What is awesome. From local flavors to ciders and everything else in-between there is surely something to please everyone. I had the Forbidden Dry Cider which was great. 

Service

Our waitress for the evening was very attentive at first and asked for our drink orders right away, and the drinks came out fairly quickly. However, we waited about 15 minutes or so between getting our drinks and placing our order. To be fair, this was not the waitresses fault and she was handling a section of about 8 tables and each table had a large number of guests.
She was very helpful in providing some food recommendations an asking if we wanted any refills of our beverages. Overall, she was very friendly and polite and providing excellent customer service.

Overall

C'est What is a great place to come for their wide array of alcoholic beverages and fairly standard and reasonable prices. The food itself is not bad either, but, in my opinion a little bit pricy for the portion size."}
{"text":"Good beer. Good service. Good atmosphere. What else could you ask for? Average pub fair, but that's expected."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for dinner while travelling for work, as he lives in the neighbourhood. Great beer selection (I really liked the coffee porter), food was good, enjoyed the atmosphere (who says you Toronto types are stuffy?). All in all, I would recommend it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"C'est What? has a great selection of local craft beers and holds many fine beer-related events. The food is also interesting and well-priced. My only reservation about this place would be related to, well, the reservation policy. 

If you arrive early to meet a group of friends, they won't let you take a table until your whole party is there. They seem to actively dislike groups and go out of their way to inconvenience them. For instance, one night we were told at 10pm that our section of the bar was closing and that our whole group of 10 would have to move to the other side after settling our bill. Odd.

Occasionally, the service in general can be surly or indifferent as well.

That being said, I'll keep coming back for the cozy atmosphere, the great beer (selection and quality) and the Dijon chicken fingers and skinny fries!"}
{"text":"I love this place, always have. The lamburger is amazing! Rasberry wheat beer is so tasty."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely terrible. I really do mean that. Even compared to the standard pub fare out there this place is on the bad end of the scale. 

Beer selection is great. 

The vibe is couples, first dates, apres work drinks. 

It's an OK place buy nothing of any great mention."}
{"text":"Okay, decent place to grab a pint. They have a pretty good selection of local brews. And the atmosphere is slightly above standard pub faire. Fairly attentive staff. Had no problem getting refills (unlike Bier Markt). Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


I'm confused about C'est What. Let me explain:
I like bars with great food, and C'est What delivers. Everything I've seen there has been well presented, and from what I've heard it's all tasty.
I like good live venues, and this one achieves something rare: it can handle light folk music and jazz acts without making you feel like you're in a cheesy lounge.
There are lots of seats, and lots of tables, and booths, and whatever else you want to sit in.
It's in a decent location, but I wouldn't go out of my way to the \"St. Lawrence area\" for a drink. That's just me.

There's just something uncomfortable about this place. Perhaps another review can explain it better: the space is odd and winding, the service is cold, and it seems to be a restaurant, lounge, venue, bar, and, well, cafe, without being a spectacular version of any of these. Maybe they were geniuses to choose such a name, but I really have to say: c'est what?

3 stars"}
{"text":"This ended up as our \"last drink\" spot before returning to our hotel on multiple occasions when I was working in Brampton and staying in Downtown for two years. Decent pub grub and good beer made C'est What a nice, relaxing way to end the night for us.

Admittedly, every time I've eaten here, I've been fairly intoxicated but do recall enjoying the lamb burger on multiple occasions. We usually got chips and salsa to munch on but food has never really been our top priority here. 

Their home brew is pretty good - I enjoyed the Coffee Porter on multiple occasions as well as the Dreaded Chocolate on Nitro. My coworkers really enjoyed the Rye and Ginger Wheat as well.

Overall, I'd say its a great place to grab a drink and relax. The atmosphere is cozy, the service has been friendly and the prices are certainly reasonable.

Drink up!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection, and my food (at least) was eccentric and yummy - poutine with Indian butter chicken on top. But the servers... what a bunch of uppity whippersnappers. 

The staff is killing this place. They're a bunch of stuck-up, unfriendly, poseurs. The hostess was incredibly rude, like she's doing us a favor by seating us. And the tragic, beardy, hipster child that was our server was a total a$$hole. Another one who was doing us favors by deigning to wait on us. Save the attitude and bring what I ordered.

And seriously, I know it's Canada, but can't I just order a pint of beer? What the f is 375 mL of beer? Silliness.

Nope."}
{"text":"Ces't What is the only place I have ever seen with A Beer Milkshake. St Ambroise Stout and Ice Cream. This was the hi-light of the evening. Definately a busy place but we got great service from our server. I was only there for drinks.

Note: This is one of the first times I've gone into C'est What and had a good experience. In the past we have always had a hard time having people seated together. mediocre service, and attitude."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit this place since I moved to Toronto because of their extensive beer list. I sampled three of their beers and really enjoyed the variety and especially the number of porters and stouts they have on tap. The only thing I would like to see is a flight or sampler paddle. Having samples is great but getting a bit of a deal for sampling say three-five would be even better!

They have really good food too! My friends and I shared the bacon wrapped shrimp, sweet potato slices, calamari, and tapenade. Given that they are known for their beer having good food as well is a great plus. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to C'est What twice now and it's becoming one of my favourite pubs. 

They have a wide selection of beers and food for every palette. 

You can order beer in three sizes; small, medium, and large. The small size (190mL) is a huge benefit if you want to sample more than two beers. 

Beers I've tried,
Al's Cask - I was shocked at how smooth it was. 
My s/o said it was almost too smooth. 

St Ambroise Apricot Wheat - The apricot flavour is very subtle. It went well with something salty on the side. 

Coffe Porter - Marries breakfast and nightlife together into one glass. Be careful, the coffee flavour is quite strong and may not agree with everyone.

Beau's Lugtread - A classic. Smooth, sweet, and havenly.

And...a peach infused beer with a name I can't remember. It was by far my favourite because of it's strong peach flavour. I tend to prefer sweet over salty and would probably have this beer for dessert when I visit next.

Food I've tried, 

Sweet Potato Fries with Chipotle Mayo - Crisp, salty, thinly sliced sweet potato with a dip that is to die for. AMAZING!

Butter Chicken (sans nan bread) - The sauce is creamy and the chicken is moist. The rice was fluffy and had fresh peas on top. This dish came with a mango chutney. The mango cut through the creamy sauce quite well. 

Jambalaya - Hot and spicy rice, meat and vege. Sweet onion running through the dish helps tie all the flavours together. It's like a party in your mouth and no one is stopping it. 

This joint has two pool tables, a few old board games and live entertainment. 

C'est What is also kid friendly. A family of 4 was seated next to our table and they seemed to be having a great time as well.

The servers are very professional and personable. Well done C'est What!"}
{"text":"Well...

I'm torn on this place.  The good parts about it is that it boasts a relatively impressive list of Canadian microbrew, and it's in a good location.  In my opinion, the fact that it doesn't have a television is actually a mark in its favor, and the subterranean cave-like atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely.  It's got pool tables and a fireplace and an alluring long line of taps that draw beer fiends like me as a backyard barbecue draws flies.

 The bad parts: when I was there, they seemed to be out of all beer brewed at C'est What?  They definitely had a bountiful selection on hand, but, I mean, I wanted to sample the wares that were brewed on premises. Felt a little cheated on that one, had to say.

The waitress was relatively helpful - when my friend asked for a selection of hoppy beers she was able to deliver appropriately.  She was kind of terse, though, which I thought was a little bit uncalled for.  You're a bartender at a beer bar.  People are going to ask you about the beer.  If you don't like being asked about beer, get a job where you are less likely to get asked about beer.

The food was so-so.  I ordered the jerk chicken roti, and was underwhelmed by it.  Not that it was a bad dish, but frankly I could have used a little less jerk in my bartender and a little more in my chicken.

Overall, if you're looking for an easy-to-get-to place that has a good selection of beer, this place would fit the bill.  However, I wouldn't necessarily recommend going for the food - it wasn't completely terrible, just that Toronto definitely has better to offer as far as that's concerned.

That being said, I would go back, but probably just for beer and to get snarky with the bartender."}
{"text":"I've spent many an evening at c'est what, including last night and have always enjoyed myself. It's cozy and comfy. Service varies from competent and pleasant enough to neglectful and rude, depending on the night. Last night was a good one. The bartender rolled with my lengthy and persnickity beer requests and recommended a couple of perfect fits from the always excellent and primarily local draft beer selection. The food is reasonably good as well - I've always been happy enough with it, but never blown away. Last night I ate the Hogtown Salad which is full of bacon and egg and yumminess. Another successful c'est what visit."}
{"text":"I came by here before a show based on the reviews. I wanted to try a burger and sample some of their beers.

First off, the food was ok. I thought the burger was a little dry and definitely not the kind of taste I liked (smoky). The poutine was off ... maybe I should have listened to everyone and had the yam frites. But really, I am quite the poutine expert and this was shit. My friend had the  curry and he barely ate 1/4 of it. It didn't taste like curry.

However, the beer selection was superb and long. I liked the variety and picked the Apricot. Due to trying it here, I promptly went to the beer store and picked up a 6 pack. My friend on the other hand did not like choice - so he picked the first beer on the list. He liked it enough but it did not make an impression.

Ambiance was cool - love the fireplace! Service was ok - the waiter did not seem to be able to provide any meaningful suggestions."}
{"text":"I was so appalled at the level of service, I have signed up to yelp to voice my opinions. 

Horrible. Sums up our night from service to prices to the drinks. 

My friends and I were looking for a bar in the downtown area after our great steaks at the keg Mansion. Sadly, Beir market had a large line, so we walked to c'est what. Apparently, if you're in a group of more than 4 you are not welcome there. How do I know this, the lady at the front said so. 

So we went in smaller groups. We saw some tables open up, closed our tab with one server, and moved to another area. Suddenly... We became criminals. Every couple of minutes a member of the staff would ask someone near tables to us if we all knew each other. A friend called in dance to say him and his partner were coming. I politely asked the server if I could have the table next to me. He said, \"go through the correct channels to get seats\". There was no line or wait list. Within seconds, a reserved sign went on the table. I told the server thanks for reserving it... Guess what! It wasn't for us.... Or anyone else... I really only said thanks to bring to his attention how rude they were all being lol. What kind of place is this!?!?

I would have brought this to the managers attention, but I bet this pretentious attitude stems top up!


To sum it up, if you're alone or on a date, you're welcome there. If you're a social person and like to meet people, prepare to feel like you've broken every rule they have."}
{"text":"I liked this place, nice atmosphere. They have a great selection of beers too. Tried the Dead Elephant ale and now it's my favourite! I was sitting at a very cosy little corner, it was nice and warm inside too which I liked. The only thing I didn't like was that the servers came by ever so often to ask if we were doing ok, so I was a bit annoyed that they were interrupting our conversation so often."}
{"text":"A great pub to go to with your friends to enjoy some beer and possibly play some scrabble!

The pub is lit and isn't dark and overly loud compare to other ones I've been to. The selection of beer is intriguing and my friends tried a few of them (they do not recommend the coal one cause they said it tasted like drinking actual coal). The two beers they loved were the Coffee Porter and the Waupoos Cider.

I had a Hazelnut Brownie which was very moist and paired well with the vanilla ice cream and the hazelnuts. Really delicious!

Definitely a great place to spend some quality time with your friends!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection, focusing on craft brews, one of the best. 
The food is definitely leaps ahead of a lot of established bar grub all over the city. 
I often find myself here before or after a leafs game even though it is a few blocks from the ACC
Great for small groups"}
{"text":"In town with the wife and needed a drink, so stopped by here.

A very good range of craft beers, more than we could try between us, mind you we did try. The Staff were great very friendly and helpful, pointing out good beers to try. Must say I would have happily come back here a few more times if time had allowed."}
{"text":"Food is pretty great (their beer cheese pot!! the chocolate hazelnut brownie for dessert!), and the beer list is nearly unmatchable. 

I love how nice and cozy it is down here in the winter, and even though it sort of makes me feel like I'm drinking in a cave, nothing stops me from coming here in the summer either. Truly one of the greats."}
{"text":"I live around the area, and have found myself frequenting c'est what often for a game of pool, an incredibly wide select of beers and reasonably priced tasty food.
To put it bluntly, c'est what is in a basement. Some people may find this a put off but I enjoy it. Being somewhat dimly lit and cool (temperature wise), it serves as a welcomed escape from a hot summer day or night.
As I mentioned, they have an incredibly long list of beers you've probably never heard of. I have found that the majority of the servers are pretty knowledgeable and honest when asked their opinion of a beer you are thinking of trying (there have been several instances where the server said a certain beer was terrible and I ordered it anyways. It was indeed, terrible). They also encourage you to try the beer before buying a pint, and will offer you a sample in a mini tasting glass which is a nice touch. Their beer list is so long, they will literally have something for everyone - even people who don't like 'regular' beers (they have some fruity beers which don't really taste like the beer most people are used to).
The food is pretty good. They have a pretty large menu, unfortunately it seems like they are often 'out' of a certain dish though. I'm not say if I would say c'est what is a bar or a restuarant, probably somewhere in between - so don't expect great food, but with that said, c'est what is definitely miles above other bar food.
All in all, if you haven't already, I would recommend checking this place out.
Pool tables are just $12/hour!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of C'Est What for a variety of reasons.

Firstly, they put a great effort into their food offerings, which are sure to delight every taste, including vegetarians. After some initial skepticism, I have converted to the Jambalaya, which I herald as a wonderful offering in terms of portion, variety and taste.

Secondly, C'est What really groks the beer lover's classification system: you can either classify beers by their origin, or by their style. No third option is allowed. CEW chose the second one and, by God, they nailed it. 

If you're not a beer snob, C'est What can make you into one (budget quite a few hours and lots of food into the equation, though). My recommendation, if you're tasting, is to take half-pints and proceed from weissbiers to lagers, to reds/ambers, to IPAs, to lambics, to stouts.  But you don't need Yelp to tell you that: ask a waiter, they're very knowledgeable in their field.

C'Est What caters to many different tastes and many different people without appearing a mish-mash. The live music section is well walled off, there's several semi-private areas for a larger party to discuss their business and, overall, whatever you seek (as long as it isn't a patio), ye shall find.

C'Est What is a very straightforward and chilled-out way to indulge your beer taste or acquire one if you hadn't prior. 

The appeal of C'est What is universal: you can take your parents or your girlfriend there and everybody will be happy, happy, happy. Following a dinner, any party can relax next to the fireplace in a setting that most closely resembles a private members' club.

My tip: always reserve and, for the love of God, if you don;t like beer, have an open mind about it! C'est What is the perfect place to have your mind blown."}
{"text":"Nice selection of craft beers and even a couple of ciders which can be difficult to find in Toronto. I ordered the tandoori chicken burger which came on naan bread, it was very tender and packed with flavour, the food was also pretty reasonable price wise for this part of town. Service was great too."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5 if I could!

C'est What? is a place that I've passed by a thousand times, and I've only managed to visit it for the first time a couple of nights ago. The place has a cool kind of basement vibe that reminds me of Down One which used to be a block away from here. There's a pool table on either end of the room and near the middle, a nice cozy area with a fireplace and some couches too. 

I liked the menu because there wasn't an overwhelming amount of things to choose from. I decided to go with the lamburger and fries, and my friend settled on the jambalaya. 

The burger was cooked to medium and served on a ciabatta bun. Total winner. The fries were tasty and seasoned nicely too. I only got a taste of the jambalaya, which was okay. Based on the picture in the menu, and on an eye test in person, its not something I would order on my next visit. Not because it was awful or anything. It just seemed... uninspired?

Besides the food, C'est What? also boasts a pretty extensive beer and wine selection. The beer menu only features Canadian-made craft beers and the wine list is made up entirely of VQA selections. A few months of living in Vancouver really kickstarted a craft beer obsession within me, so this was good news. I opted for a bottle of La Fin du Monde (The End of the World) which was pretty awesome. I could see myself coming back to this place time and again just to try out the rest of their craft beer selection.

C'est What? loses marks for the service, which was not the worst I've come across. Although, had we been made to feel a bit more welcome then it would easily be a 5 star review. 

If I was still living in the city, I would easily be a regular at C'est What? The laid-back atmostphere makes it an easy choice to come back to over and over again. Look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Reliable - I go here when I am with a group and stuck in the vortex of where do you want to go? No, I don't like that place. Well I don't like Option B. lordjesus

Anyhoo, cliche perhaps, there is something here for everyone. I used to come here for lunch all the time with the previous company I worked for since it was an 8 minute walk. They got to know us which is helpful when  you are on a mandated lunch time. 

I don't know of anything amazing that I would say you must, with alacrity, swath this way! but you won't be drinking haterade either."}
{"text":"Went there to play some pool late night, good little spot, tables are in okay shape and there's lots of good beer to choose from. Music's good and creates a nice atmosphere. The kitchen was closed but I've heard good things about the food and will likely be back to try it out. Great place to hang out after work, have a few beers with your buddies and play some pool."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere in this place and the beer selection but the food sucks.  I had the jerk chicken roti and it was the blandest thing I've ever eaten.  Tasted like some hippy food you'd buy out of a van at a Dead show.  Two or three pieces of chicken and a bunch of mushy vegatables.  No rice, no cheese, no sour cream.  Boring."}
{"text":"Agree with Sarah B., what happened to the relaxed, beer a-plenty afternoon killer? Doesn't matter how many people you show up with, you now get a list of rules and inconveniences before they deign to seat you.  Don't be two minutes ahead of your party - if you don't have quorum, you don't get a table.  

The beer selection is great of course, and the only reason to visit.  Just don't expect simple conveniences like split bills, the ability to add a chair if a friend shows up (god forbid), or pleasant service."}
{"text":"The beer selection here is pretty typical of a place that advertises a wide beer selection. However it did not have anything super unique. If you are a fellow traveller on a quest to taste the greatest number of different and unique beers you've probably tried everything on this menu at other places. Having said that this bar is not bad. Its pretty big and can be a fun place to visit with a group of friends who have a wide array of tastes."}
{"text":"First time here in over 10 years was on Monday night and the place is still great. A cool underground spot with a tap list that should have any beer nerd wondering what to order.

Stopped in with my family after going to the Toronto Zoo. Place was a bit empty which got us seated right away. For food we just split some apps. Calamari, tzatziki and hummus plate, poutine and the beer cheese pot. The hummus was a bit thick and dry but everything else was great. Wash it down with a tasty IPA or their Hemp Ale and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Soooo I read the reviews for this place before I came here, went out for dinner with my mom and a close family friend, and he actually suggested the place. I had heard that the pulled pork was bland...silly meee why didn't I listen?? I just though hmm maybe they were having a bad day...nope it just sucks. 
The pork was BLAND, like I mean it was like sucking on cardboard. The \"au jus\" or whatever it comes with was just as bad. It needed some flavour!!! The pork was tough and all lumped together in a rock like formation, it;s supposed to be pulled hence the name...guess the kitchen didn't catch on. 
However, our friend had the falafels (sp??) which I tried and I very much enjoyed. They were not lacking in flavour at all. This is the main reason I am giving it a two.
I'm not a beer drinker but they did have a wide range of beer (as others have stated) and the wait staff seemed to know them inside and out. This is appreciated seeing as I know I myself can be very indecisive, and a waiter who knows their shit is a winner. Our friend ordered one that the waiter suggested and was please. The waiter however was not a talkative one, and a little on the neglectful side. This being said the place was packed and I could barely hear the two people sitting right next to me. Also a reason for the low scoring. 
I do also appreciate their efforts to use only local and organic foods on their menus but it's not enough to salvage the crappy meal I had. 
Needless to say I don't think I'll be jumping for joy if anybody suggests this place for dinner again."}
{"text":"If you have a large group of over 12 people avoid coming here. The hostess will not accommodate you with another table or the bar area and escort EVERY single guest to ensure you don't exceed the limit. Turns out the hostess can't even count because at one point we did not reach 12 yet. Reluctantly the hostess agreed to let our additional (12th) guest in. 

Drink selection not bad, butter chicken is bland."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, attractive staff.  Better food than pubs, and a real beer list, so you don't have to eat & drink at separate places."}
{"text":"I am really confused by reading all the mostly positive reviews of their food.  Ordered a veggie burger - WOW, it was the worst food I have EVER had.  There was no taste what so ever.  The patty was so bland, cardboard would surely had more taste.  I was with a group of people who all ordered different dishes and no one complained so I'm not.  I didn't complain out loud as well just made a mental note that I will most likely not ever eat there.

Service was great, staff was attentive...and cute.

The ambient is okay, crowd mixed with majority being from the Financial district (after work drinks, quick lunch, etc).

I will not be stopping by again unless I have to."}
{"text":"Nice little bar on Front street. They have a good collection of reasonably priced beers and scotch. the crowd is always lively and the vibe is great. They also have live music playing on some nights! 

As far as the food goes, I wasn't very impressed. The bronto ribs were really good. The appetizer - I think it was called antojitos was bland and the le grand shepherd was just ok!"}
{"text":"Great layout to maximize the use of space. Best appetizer are the sweet potatoes chips that would keep me coming back. :) They've done exceptionally well to contain the atmosphere of professionals and tourists."}
{"text":"My friend knows someone who works here. She recommended the jambalaya or lamb burger. Had the lamb burger it was great. We also shared the cheese pot delish and the banana bread cocktail with ginger beer as one of the ingredients was a great drink!"}
{"text":"C'est What has great beer options  but rude bartenders. The atmosphere is lacking with too much brightness that takes away from the cozy hidden bar experience. I have been here only three times and believe it or not, every single time I was arguably  ignored by wait staff and bar personnel because they were busy eating food by the work station and conversing among themselves. Perhaps the culture of the establishment encourages employees to neglect providing  proper service and instead facilitates an atmosphere where they can  be easily  seen diping their fingers into salads and shareble plates while customers wait for service. I would recommend going to Bar Hop instead for  better service  and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place needs to have better service, one waiter for half of the restaurant?  Ya that ain't good at all. Took us maybe 10 minutes to get our bills?

This is a place you come for drinks with buddies not a place to have great food, although the bison burger was good.  I think their food menu is very limited, especially entrees, they have a lot more beer selections than food items though .

Atmosphere seems cozy and comfortable, it's even got two billiard tables for guests.  This restaurant is in the basement so don't expect any type of street view, the ceiling seems kind of low but it doesn't feel cramp at all.

I got the #9 dark IPA, tasted very good and it was also very strong.  They have literally millions of beers for you to choose from.

In summary, come to this place for when beer/drink is your main priority and food as supplement"}
{"text":"Good food, great menu.  Poutin and chocolate stout were the highlights.

Played some scrabble while we munched out appetizers.  Lamb burger and morrocan chili were outstanding.

No children's menu, so my kids ate desert instead, which they thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES
C'est What the shit is so special about this place? I don't get it. It's like a Lion's Club or a Swiss Chalet circa 1985. No ambiance, no feel and annoyingly placed tables and chairs.  

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
I've been told they have a wonderful selection of brews but my recommendation would be to do what I did, order a rye and then refill with your own bottle under the table. 

LOCATION NOTES
Just East of Church on Front. Basement unit. 

SERVICES NOTES
I've been told the service is bad here but I was too drunk to notice. 

HUMOUROUS STORY
To all those who were at the Yelp after party and then noticed I suddenly wasn't there anymore...I'm sorry."}
{"text":"Great location downtown, food exemplary, great beer selection. O my downside was staff person serving us - we seemed to be a bit of a thorn in his side. Beef short ribs a huge portion, shepherds pie delicious."}
{"text":"Apricot wheat beer is delish.

I remember C'est What much more smokey and dark, but maybe that was in its jazz bar days.  It seems more of a medium scale after work bar nowadays.  But it still works for a good brew, and it's cool they have only local beers on tap and in the bottle.  Way to represent!"}
{"text":"Always great beer selection here especially their casks. Food is always solid from their wraps, burgers to their curries and other entrees. Food complements the beer selection very well. Cozy atmosphere and can chill or play a game of pool. Great spot to just hangout in"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends, and was lucky enough to get the couch area, which was very nice, with a fireplace and bookshelves. The service was good, I felt that we were looked after. I wasn't too impressed with the food, but I only tried a series of the appetizers, so I cannot fairly speak for the entrees. The price was right for the drinks as well. However, I still found that it was fairly average. I enjoyed my time there, but I wouldn't be in a huge hurry to go back.

The beer floats SOUND delicious, but I found them to be not at all! (Unless you are a huge fan of dark beer.)"}
{"text":"This place used to be a great hangout spot. But in the last few years, it has gone down hill fast. 

Attempted to go there for my 30th birthday awhile back with a group of 15 people. Was told they do not take reservations and just to show up. When we arrived, the place was close to empty (at 10pm on a Saturday) but was told they could not seat us together since we were too large a group. 

We found a section where there were enough seats if we moved the tables together but were told since it was two different waiters, we were not allowed. 

Ended up leaving. If they want to turn down 15 paying customers, then so be it.

Still an ok place to go for microbrew beer with a small group of friends. Don't order food."}
{"text":"BEERS! BEERS EVERYWHERE!

There is a huge list to choose from and, really, what else can I ask for? 

The food was really good as well. I'd definitely recommend the Tandoori Chicken Sandwhich, which was moist, full of flavour, and totally hit the spot. 

The service was good, although it's weird that I had to go up to the actual counter to order because I was sitting at the high table with a few friends."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Toronto, I've seen how customer service has declined over the past 15 years or so, but this was probably one of my worst experiences, ever.

I brought a large group of friends here who were tourists from Europe or Quebec.  It was their last night in Toronto and they wanted to enjoy good food and drinks, in great company.  

I knew that we were in for an evening of bad service because it took the wait staff about 30 minutes to take our drink orders.  The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and it was okay, but nothing special.  The evening continued on, adequately, with our waiter making an occasional appearance to take our drink orders.  The worst part of the night was when the waiter brought us our bill, without being asked to do so by anyone.  It was still fairly early to leave for a Saturday night (approx. 21:30) and were all enjoying ourselves and ordering drinks so we perceived this as their way of asking us to leave. 

Everyone was disappointed and quite surprised at the lack of hospitality.  
I will never return to this restaurant and if I could give 1/2 star (just for the restaurant being operational), I would."}
{"text":"I really like C'est What. I love the selection of beers and I'm always happy with the veggie options.  I always take friends who are not from the city here.  I really only go in the winter or on rainy days though.  The summer's too nice to be inside with no windows."}
{"text":"Went there because a friend of mine recommended it, it was a flop, the good: extensive beer selection, great basement location, neat decor, fireplace in the middle of the restaurant. Now, the bad: the calamity we ordered, it was obviously frozen, so chewy, the lighting was terrible, it looked like a diner it was so bright, it could look so much better if it was dimmed a little bit. I won't return."}
{"text":"C'est What is my go-to place to catch up or meeting up with friends in the St Lawrence Market area.  It is great for big groups as they are able to accommodate.  The vibe is this unpretentious, laid-back feel, you feel comfortable in your own skin.

They have some unique beers on tap which is their draw.  The food is above par pub style grub with a decent vegetarian selection.  My favourite thing on the menu is the lamb burger.  Avoid the yam fries if you can, they are greasy butterfly style. 

On busy nights (Fridays/Saturdays) they have live bands.  It is a great place to hang-out after work.

Make C'est What your go-to spot in the St Lawrence Market area!"}
{"text":"For our one and only night in Toronto on a long road trip back from Boston, we had limited time and limited patience for anything less than a stellar pub experience - fortunately, C'est What welcomed us with open arms. 

I'm a fan of vegetarian food. Check. I'm a fan of fine beers. Check. I'm a fan of friendly waitresses and bartenders who give me honest assessments of their offerings. Check.

My only complaint is that they're so, so far away. But eventually I'll make it back."}
{"text":"Now, I've been coming to C'est What for years.
To grab a pint with a friend, I'll keep coming back.
The beer list is extensive and the comfort food is decent.

However, I came here with my team from work and it was a completely horrible experience.

Firstly, the website says no reservations.
Their voicemail says the don't take reservations.
They NEVER answer the phone.

I showed up with my team of eight people - early on a snowy day.
I was asked if I had reservations - I said no, but I had tried to call many times.

They made space for us at the back which worked fine.
The first server definitely did not want to be there.
He said, what do you want and his attitude was completely embarrassing.
It turns out his shift was ending - not that he told us, he disappeared.

The second server was much better. 
I'm used to having a server make recommendations about the beer  - we had to ask but at least she was friendly about it.

They were out of the bacon-shrimp, which was one of the only appetizers I could eat.

The third server was equally as bad as the first server.

I felt frustrated about the entire evening.  I apologized to my coworkers and I will never return here with colleagues."}
{"text":"4 stars for the beer - very good.  The food is a riskier proposition - it's strictly comfort food, and they make a decent burger and lamb burger, and once I had a pork sandwich special that was very good.  Sometimes the food is downright bad, though - we had some sort of tortilla roll thing that was awful, and the shepherd's pie is awful.  Go for the beer, and play it safe on the food."}
{"text":"A dead horse has more personality than anyone that works here.
Terrible, Terrible service.
And the kicker I sat at the bar.

People just kept walking bye me.
No hello, nothing

It was so painful watching the waitstaff.

Don't go here people...

Take my money down the street."}
{"text":"Very cool and funky place to chill with friends. The whole place is divided into multiple areas. 

The entrance of the place is into a basement brick. The vibe is low key and chilled  with fireplace and pool tables along with cozy couch area. Then you have the bar area  and if you keep walking around there is the live band area (live music at some nights only). Food is not bad at all. 

Over all a good place to chill and relax with friends."}
{"text":"Didn't expect anything from this bar, just thought it would be typical bar fare. But I was pleasantly surprised by how good everything was. Got the beef ribs- it was very good, good texture and taste, great tasty mashed potatoes and awesome salad it comes with- worth the price if $19. My friend got the goat roti- that was also very awesome! Really tasty- around $16. And my other friend got the Dijon chicken- that was also great- good batter and seasoning. The craft beers are also very good! My friend tried a peppercorn beer- twas different but cool. Had Detour beer- nice and light. Would def come back- this place def gives the right value for the price!!!"}
{"text":"2 words: bison burger. This is one of the best burgers I've ever had. Pricey, but so so so worth it. Doesn't even need the cheese or the bacon. Decor is nice too, dark, but that's the style. We were on a time crunch and the staff accommodated. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Really should've tried the poutine when I had the chance!

I have to say, I was underwhelmed after the hype I had been hearing. While the interior was gorgeous and cozy, the seating was a bit tight. My friend and I came during the early evening, which was busy, and the service was not great. The food was decent, but a bit overpriced.

I would definitely give C'est What a second chance, but it definitely was not the experience I was hoping for my few days in Toronto."}
{"text":"Coming here always reminds me of a mountain chalet. Great ambiance and large selection of beer. Food is pretty decent as well. Frequent here often after work."}
{"text":"Great place on Front Street.  I walked right past it the first time though.  But you walk downstairs and the place is much bigger than it looks from the outside.

Just minutes from my hotel.  Staff was nice.  Ordered the poutine as i guess its a common dish is Canada.  Mom had a couple of beers.   ordered a glass with their name/logo on it for $5 and we were off to another destination. 


I would most definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Okay my last few reviews have been somewhat lazy but I better write a decent one here out of fear that Melissa F will stab me at the next Elite event with yelpstick.

So an after work birthday celebration lead me to the east side of town to this place, I had my reservations at first whether I would actually like the place but lo and behold awesome!

The place is located downstairs in basement level but thank f**k my phone still works down there. 

To the left is some pretty open seating, some cool sofas around a fire place and best of all pool tables and no douchebags in backwards baseball caps to be seen. 

The rest of the area consists of different sections with high tables and normal seating.

Our group of 10 were seated quickly, with a few tables being put together and we ended up spending a full five hours here. 
I ended up going through a portion of calamari, fish tacos and a shepherds pie - the starters were fine, the fish tacos especially nice but the shepherds pie was screwy! I thought they had given me a lasagne when I saw that the top layer was cheese! NOOOOO how dare you ruin one of my favourite dishes! Sorry for those who know me, will also know that I HATE cheese. If cheese was a person I would not hold the lift for him/her. 

So with my mains being a let down the desert was a saviour. I have no idea what it was called now, oh...a 'beer float' i think. Imagine a pint glass with half ale/stout covered in cream and ice cream. I didnt expect it to be the best tasting desert ever but it was something I enjoyed and if you do try it dont let anyone tell you 'chug' it, dumb idea.

The service was top notch, the guys who covered our area were always nearby and checking up on us. I wish this place was downstairs in my basement so I could always go here, seriously check it out."}
{"text":"Good beer, decent food, solid vibe. Staff could be friendlier though. Drop the Portland hipster thing and just be friendly."}
{"text":"surprisingly spacious for a basement unit; noticed there were good number of pool tables. you'll need at least half of your reservation to be present before seating if you're a large group. 

lots of beer selection, liquor options also a plenty. food is subpar pub food and service is often absent. does the job as a watering hole but doesn't offer much more.."}
{"text":"I was recently deflowered by C'est What, and I gotta say, I LOVED it. From the outside, you can't tell what the ambiance is going to be like once you get inside, but take my word for it - the environment is awesome.

It's best described as a very classy pub set inside an eclectic basement. Very cool.

The service is excellent - our waitress was attentive but not overbearing.

The food was alright (I wouldn't get the same thing again), and the prices were decent.

Overall, a great experience. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Bar pub situé dans le quartier financier le C'est What ressemble à une sorte de chalet au ski. Du bois partout et un gros coin cheminée avec des sièges confortables pour prendre sa bière.
Il y a un système de boîtier clignotant pour les réservations de table.
Au menu burgers, club sandwich et aussi des plats végétariens.
J'ai pris la fameuse poutine dont les français qui reviennent du Canada parlent tant. Pas mal du tout avec un supplément bacon.
En dessert le crumble pomme cannelle est une tuerie.
Bref une 1ere expérience torontoise très satisfaisante.

Le petit plus : les 2 billards à dispo des clients.

{"text":"We came here because the wait time was not as ridiculous as Bier Markt or Mill Street Brew Pub for the Christmas Market on a Saturday night. I've been here previously for Toronto Beer week, and had not tried the food here. This time, it was definitely a pleasant surprise. The highlight of C'est What is the Goat cheese beer pot with multiple dipping varieties (pita bread, olives, chicken skewers, grape tomatoes...) for $15. Sort of fondue-y, and the beer/cheese dip concoction, we agreed, was the best dish we had for appetizers that night--rich, spiced up by herbs, with a tang of beer aftertaste. It's a great dish to try and share with a couple of friends if you're on your way to the distillery for the Christmas market, or if you're just in the area. There is also a wide variety of beer choices--Al's Cask and the Waupaas Cider are recommended! The one thing that I think could be improved upon was the poutine--the fries are small and the dish size was much smaller than expected from glancing at the menu. But overall, a pleasant meal--decent value for reasonable price."}
{"text":"Beer - 4 stars
Service - 1 star

Stopped by today in a group of 10. We took over the corner of the bar and rented the two pool tables (you pay by the hour). We were there midweek. First the good:

- great craft beer selection. At least 25 different options covering the full spectrum of beer styles. I enjoyed the Apricot wheat beer, Dead Elephant ale and Steve's Dreaded Chocolate.
- Relaxed / casual atmosphere. They have an area with couches around a fireplace as well.
- I didn't eat but the food menu looked interesting.
- a couple pool tables to rent by the hour (about $12 - very reasonable fro downtown prices).

The not so good:

- Service was terrible. They were frustrated that we were a big group and they couldn't remember who ordered what.
- The server never came back after the first beer to top us up. We had to go to the bar every time. The odd thing was the place was empty, so it wasn't busy. The staff would pick up our empty glasses and not ask if we wanted a refill."}
{"text":"Actually played a show here in one of the nicest little live venues the city has to offer. Great sound man, nice PA, great sound... Live music room is set apart from the rest of the restaurant so those who came to listen to music can enjoy without disturbing those who didn't... And vice versa. Food was good but only had a few appetizers... Beer selection was great with several home brews on the list... And for those who care... I do... The bathrooms are nice, clean and private... There's even full doors on the stalls! I'd def recommend this place for a night out."}
{"text":"Really liked the place! 

Had dinner with some friends and enjoyed some good canadian beer and a very tasty falafel sandwich. Service was friendly and the place has some pool tables in case you wanna play a bit. Recommendable :)"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! Great beer selection including cask and the poutine was delicious!"}
{"text":"With all the burger hype in the city, I thought I should jump on the bandwagon. Been hearing a lot of good things about C'est What, so off I went. Takes a lot of convincing to eat somewhere with good beer. ;) 

Located in a lower level on Front St, it was about a 10min walk from Union. It's open concept, so it doesn't feel like you're in a basement. The staff are warm and welcoming. We were seated and headed for the beer menu(it is a good one!). It seemed like many patrons had also come here for a beer after a long day! Seemed like the right thing to do. I don't see McAuslan's Apricot Wheat on many menus, so that sealed the deal. My friend is a hoppier beer drinker and tried the Big Butt Smoked Dark Ale and the Chocolate Ale. I tasted both. The smoked ale tasted like beer and bacon.... it was interesting! I'm a chocolate gal, but I don't feel the chocolate flavour came through as strong as it should have. Many other beers on the menu I'd like to try! 

As for food, we shared a Buffalo Burger and a Lamburger. I mostly just wanted to say 'Lamburger' out loud. So worth it. The Bison burger was tasty! Bison a very lean meat, so there was ample tomato-onion chutney. It was juicy, but dense. The herbed fries were so good, that they're in my top 5! My Lamburger was on fresh naan with fresh veggies and oodles of tzatziki(as there should be!). It came with housemade chips. They were OK, but the herbed fries were too good not to steal. I'm a fan of lamb and this was doing it for me. I'd get this again. At least now I know it's as enjoyable to eat as it to say out loud. :D 

The service was great. The hosts were welcoming and our server was super cool. A chill atmosphere with chill staff. There was live music going on as well, but it was in a different room, so it wasn't super loud. It was played to the rest of the venue over speakers, so you could still talk and not yell.  

Looks like I'll be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Three point five. It's a good pub atmosphere, and clean too. All sorts of music playing, I heard a good amount of industrial. They've got a wide selection of beers, although being underage the most I got was a couple sips of my dad's Steam Whistle (which was pretty good). Service was friendly but a bit slow, and they forgot to bring my dad his beer.

I got the buffalo burger. It was seasoned well but I should have ordered it slightly more rare. Buffalo meat is far leaner than cow meat (tastes the same though) so you lose those nice greasy juices. The barbecue sauce that came with it was too liquid, as in it could have been thicker. The fries were great! I had mine as poutine, which for the uninitiated are fries with gravy and cheese curds. They're delicious, although slightly bad for the arteries. But to quote something from the menu, \"A diet is a way to starve yourself so you live a few more years.\" The regular fries were also tasty.

Overall I enjoyed C'est What? and would recommend it to anyone who wants a good pub experience with some good food. Be warned, it gets expensive: ran about $85 for four people."}
{"text":"Expansive selection of Canadian taps, which is just what someone from south of the border likes to see when seeking new beers. Staff is an A+ and the bison burger was cooked just right and came out quickly. Can't sing enough raise about C'est What"}
{"text":"If you like beer - then go here.  Run here!  Live here.

I was told recently by a co-worker there are \"two types of girls - those who drink beer, and those who don't\".  While I disagree with the bones of this statement, while I might choke down a Fruili if I have to, I guess I am at the root of my being \"a girl who does not drink beer\".

However, it is Beer Week and they had a pretty cool sounding event going on.  When we got there, there was a line-up to get in!  But it moved quickly.

I like this spot because it's casual.  It feels like you're hangin' at a friend's basement.  However - the staff are friendly, just like your friend who owns said basement.  Sometimes this casual nature can mean too hands-off service - I would have liked more attentiveness.  

I would have given it three but that's because of my personal opinion on beer, and no fault of C'est What."}
{"text":"C'est What has some of the best and most consistent microbrews in the city.

I have been several times over my years in Toronto and haven't been disappointed. The food is usually a cut above standard pub food and the beers keeps people coming back. The Dark Stout and the Carraway Rye Ale are both really delicious. Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"C'est What is one of the best destinations in the city for beer. It's more laid back than the Bier Market and they have a fun vibe. 

The menu is decent and large with something for most tastes including a couple great vegetarian options but it's definitely not worth a special trip for dinner in my opinion. Unless you're drinking your dinner.

But back to the beer... the beer menu is amazing. I believe they have up to 30 beers on tap including fruity beers, beers brewed on site, wheat beers, ales, pilsners, dark beers, literally every kind of beer you could ask for mostly (maybe exclusively?) from Canadian micro-brews.

Definitely worth a trip if you're a beer lover and want a sample a few."}
{"text":"This review is for the food at C'est What only.  If you want a place to have a great beer and relax with friends, C'est What is perfect, no argument.  And they have terrific live music.  But the food is so disappointing that it makes me annoyed.  Because I really do want to enjoy it.  This is especially true for their vegetarian choices.  At first, the menu looks very veggie friendly (5 entree options), but my husband and I have eaten 4 out of the 5 over two visits and they have all been terrible.

Vegetarian gumbo is like something your older brother (sorry, Ben, not you) would cook you if he was babysitting.  Overcooked, mushy rice, mixed with canned tomatoes, tofu cubes and some non-descript spices on a plate.  C'mon C'est What!  Put your game face on.  At least TRY to make something appealing.

The Tofu wrap was boring because there was no real flavour in the grilled veggies (which, by the way, were odd for \"grilled vegetables\" - they were carrots, broccoli and peppers which made me wonder if they were leftover from a stir fry dish).  There was, however, salt.  I don't know what they used to marinate that tofu, but it tasted like a salt lick.  Literally inedible.  (Unless you are my husband who willingly ate mine because his gumbo left him hungry and unsatisfied).

The roti is uninspiring and the quesadillas are standard but certainly nothing worth writing home about.  

I would say that meat eaters might have more success, but I glimpsed the inside of my brother-in-law's burger and, rather than being pink and juicy, it looked grey.  With ground beef, that's a total turn-off for me.  We tried the fried calamari, too.  No flavour, but at least they weren't overcooked.

Oh yeah, and the service is slow.

So, in conclusion:

Go for beer
Go for fries (those are pretty good)
Go for basement cave

Don't go for food.

Vegetarian score = 4/10.  Lots of choices, but none of them are worth your time."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most mellow, cool bars I have ever been to! Came by super late in the evening, so it wasn't very busy, but it had a great atmosphere to it. Couches, pool tables, and local craft beers make for a fun evening.

The bartenders there were all super friendly and explained all their beers quite aptly. They don't have any of the brand name beers you'd typically find in other bars, but they can make some great suggestions for something similar. The pool table was a nice addition to the area, though you do have to pay by the hour.

Overall a super cool/fun place that I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Great beer and craftails (a cocktails made with liquor and craft beer). Bartenders are always friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. Interesting basement feel with high and low top tables, pool tables, and a fireplace. I haven't tried to food yet there because we tend to eat somewhere else and then find our way to C'est What? 

The owner of C'est What? was the founder of Toronto Beer Week so it is definitely a must-go."}
{"text":"Found this through yelp of course while visiting Toronto food looked interesting but i was a bit skeptical. Ordered the butter chicken and was pleasantly surprised it was pretty good (i wasn't expecting authentic here). My mom ordered the Roti and was surprised again the actual roti was good it was massively filled with veggies though and was ok flavor wise. My bf had the bison burger and the coffee porter bbq sauce was a bit on the runny side but was really good and he added jalepenos on top of that (not such a good idea it became too spicy but still really good) Beer selection was not as much as i thought it would be but the beers we had from the rotating cask menu were good."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at C'est What! We went for my friend's birthday on a Tuesday.  Our sever was prompt, and helped me pick a great tasting beer from an excellent selection. I also had the club wrap, which was a little above average in price, but typical of a downtown location and quite tasty.
The atmosphere is fun and they have a variety of seating options (bar, tables, comfy chairs) and a pool table. 
We were a large group of 12+ ppl, so I wasn't sure how it would go, but I'm happy to say the night was a success!"}
{"text":"So yummy. This would have been a 5 star but their hostess was kind of a B with an itch. Everyone else was very pleasant. However, if a glass breaks and a piece flies across the room and hits one of my patrons in the back. You better believe at least one of her drinks would be free. The food though.  Was delish! All homemade. Not a single bit of processed stuff. Their sweet potato chips were fantastic.  Nice atmosphere, clean and we'll maintained."}
{"text":"C'est What? It's an alright place to hang out and grab a bite to eat. The food was a bit bland and the spicing is a bit off balanced. The falafel and jerk chicken roti looked good, but did not taste right. It was edible and ok, but definitely room for improvement.  The place has a good list of draft beer which is a plus....but the staff didn't really seem to know too much about the draft/beer difference when you ask them for suggestions.  It was just A-Ok, that is all I have to say."}
{"text":"I really, really like C'est What? for their remarkable beer selection. I love that I can order beer in three quantities. Sometimes I am driving and sampling a few of the 175mL is a really nice way of getting some variety without getting drunk. And oh.. the variety! There are always casks and taps a-plenty. I guess there are bottles, but I never order them so I can't say for sure. 

I have always found the service to be pleasant for the most part, at least at tables. I have had a harder time at the bar, but I am usually at the bar when it's especially crazy. 

The food here is good, but not amazing. I am especially fond of the sweet potato chips and the bison burger.

Environment is quite cozy and I adore it. 

Really, go to C'est What? for the beer above all else, but even if you happen to not be into beer, you'll still have a decent experience."}
{"text":"This place is quite again and on a Saturday night. What was funny is that every table has a reserved name plate. We were sat in the corner next to a large group of chatty women and the whole restaurant was more or less empty. Why seat is here? We asked to be moved. That table had a reserved name plate as well. What is up with that. So many rooms, so many free tables. The ribs were good. Piled on a ton of fries that were squashed and did not look appetizing. Still a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Ok, this is the THIRD time I've reviewed this place.  WHY? Because I am officially calling this best pub to grab a beer in Toronto.  For the last two years I've been destroying my liver to find the best multi-purpose bar and I have definitely found it.

what does multi-purpose mean?  It means that I can:
-Have brunch, lunch and dinner here
-Come with a big group of friends and have it please everyone
-Come with a small group of friends and have a great time
-Come BY MYSELF and have a great time
-Come here to have an affordable meal and study (that's right, I said STUDY) in a pub
-And come here to catch kickass live music.

My regular menu order consists of the chocoloate ale with the lamb burger.

Be careful with reccommendations- they generally discourage me from ordering the beers that I actually like.  what? A gal can't like a dark/heavy beer?
So I do encourage you to try different beers before you commit to a pint.  They oblige.

I love this place.  even though I DID get carded the other night = )"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection, very good pub food, and a nice casual atmosphere. I've been coming to C'est What for years and it remains a favourite."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, decent service, good food, great list of Canadian microbrews."}
{"text":"C'est What is arguably the best place to hang out in the St. Lawrence Market area. As it has a number of great things going for it. 

-) First it is somewhat close to transit. 
-) It does not get horribly packed like the Bier Market
-) It is great for large or small groups. 
-) Depending where you sit it is a great place to take a date
-) If you are a beer lover you will like the pretty vast selection of brews
-) Has a bit of that Montreal, basement, exposed brick, chilled vibe AND a fireplace. 
-) Food is not bad at all. However not the best Toronto has to offer but it will suffice. 
-) Some nights there is live music, check your listings. 
-) Pool tables. 

I like it for its laid back decour, vibe and a lack of pretentiousness. Wine selection is alright and most pints will start you off at around the $7+ mark. Which for this hood is pretty standard. 

I like how they are more like a multi-purpose venue, so I would not call this place a pub since it does not have  any of that British/Irish... well English vibe that say the Firkins have. Which is nice and different. 

Definitely an institution in the hood and a great place to come with friends and just hang out and chat. I highly recommend this popular place."}
{"text":"Go to spot.  Absolutely love it.  Completely unique, with 3 fireplaces, pretty decent food for the price and for a pub.

The beer selection of course is the star of the show.

Only thing bringing this down from a 5 is it is underground and slightly cellar like which makes it amazing for the winter, but less than ideal during the summer.

Oh and one last thing... the service experience, for the most part, is pretty rough.  As always, there's some really really great people in there, but in general I find the hostesses unwelcoming, and the rest of the staff expressionless at best.  Maybe I'm just sensitive :P"}
{"text":"a very nice pub with lots of semiprivate corners and niches with tables. 

can accommodate big groups.

the menu is extensive but I didn't have a chance to look into the food menu. just drinks. and the selection is great.

there is also a cozy little stage for live music that we missed (the band just started to unpack when we were leaving) 

but the atmosphere and the location are definitely superior."}
{"text":"Cozy, underground-ish pub with pretty good snacks and your choice of most any beer. Good for meeting friends and hanging out, well-appointed space and friendly service."}
{"text":"this is your downtown hideaway with pool tables, fireplaces and a great selection of beers. the prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is quite  relaxing and the service is decent. one of my favourite get aways in the downtown area. highly recommended, and try the jambalaya."}
{"text":"This is another place I've been meaning to try for a while, especially once I found out that the boyfriend loves it.  After deciding that lines at Food Truck Eats were too long for our level of hunger, we decided to head over there instead.  

It's located in a basement, and I really enjoyed the rustic decor - simple tables and chairs, exposed brick, and graphic retro prints on the walls.  It felt very cozy and homey.  The server was very good at recommending beers to us, we each got something different and after tasting the others decided that we both preferred our own.  This is a place that doesn't serve \"regular\" beer, they're all locally brewed.  We both ordered the lamb burger, his with regular fries and mine with yam frites.

The food came out pretty quickly which was nice - we were hungry!  The burgers came with tzatziki sauce, which was a nice combination with the lamb.  It was honestly some of the best tzatziki I've ever had, and I love Greek food.  The burger was large, juicy, and delicious.  Unfortunately when I tried my frites (they were like potato chips made with yams), they were overcooked.  All I could taste was char.  With ketchup they were okay, but that shouldn't be necessary.  The regular fries were quite tasty though.

Considering how good the burger was, I would be willing to overlook the yams except for one thing - the price was $12.95.  Our two burgers and two beers were over $50 with tax and tip, and that's pretty pricey for lunch - and pretty pricey for burgers in general.  

All in all, it was a very tasty lunch other than the yam frites, but the price point was too high for what it was.  I would recommend this place for beers more than for the food."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, good atmosphere, crappy food. That's C'est What? in a nutshell. We came on a Saturday and they had live music. Overall it's a great place to meet people over a drink. 

Their beer is really the next level. They sell in 3 sizes so you can either try several things, or get a big dose of what you love. They have so many unique beers. Stick with the drinks. We app we ordered was awful. Prices on drinks are alright. 

I would come again."}
{"text":"Great environment to chat and hang with friends"}
{"text":"Decent long time local haunt in Toronto.  Has aged fairly well, food is consistantly decent, have not been disappointed.  Great micro draught beer selection for Ontario.  Nice alternative to the Esplanade once in awhile."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people come for the beer, but we came for lunch and were not disappointed. The portions were massive and delicious. The pulled pork quesadilla came with a huge side of tortilla chips and guacamole, and the bison burger came with a side of herb fries. 

Everything was tasty, fresh, hot and came to our table quickly. There only seemed to be one guy serving the whole restaurant during lunch but you could tell he has been working there for awhile! He gave us awesome customer service, and made the whole experience that much more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I'm really like the food selection here. I have all these dietary restrictions, and they have so many different choices and variety of foods. Also they don't make a big deal about substitutions. 
At the same time I was really craving all the yummy fries as the smell wafted past me, and almost every other thing on the menu. 
It's still a bar, but not with bar food. 

The have an extensive selection of beer, including some non wheat or yeast beer and we excited over the cider and st. ambroise beer. 

The service was quick, efficient, and friendly. They seem to always have seating available. And we definitely overstayed our time there, but no dirty looks. 
I like the bathrooms too with it's low ceilings and exposed concrete."}
{"text":"Good subterranean fun can be had at C'est what. With hourly pool tables and relatively affordable beverages C'est What is most definitely an option on a Friday/Saturday night. A great pre-drink spot to be sure. Could do with a few more pool tables, yet the food is good and the price is right."}
{"text":"I came to Toronto and was determined to have as goat curry roti.  This place was on my list because of the beer.  I had no idea that craft brews were becoming popular in Toronto.  Hooray for that.  No beer that I had jumped out at me.  My favorite Canadian beer up until then was La Fin du Monde by Unibroue.  The goat roti felt Canadianised.  It had vegetables in it and was not the same as what you would find at more authentic Caribbean/West Indian places.  That said, this is a chill place to grab a pint or three."}
{"text":"Lamburger - tasty
Ribs - delicious
Fries - great!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! 
Food was great, fantastic beer selection. The live music was great.
I told my wife when we got there that we were going to be there all night, jokingly, but we did indeed stay till late. We sat arround the fire drinking and making new friends.
If I go back to Toronto I will definitely go back here!

The crem brule is to die for.  You can get a free desert coupon at the mall that is close by on one of those tourist racks."}
{"text":"Over the years I've gone to C'est What for lunch and dinner, during the week, after work, on the weekend, at a variety of times. While the service is on the slow side, it seems to stem less from inattentivenes and more from a relaxed casual dining atmosphere.

It's a great little place for a beer and burger after work, or a date, or just a bite. I'm a big fan of the lamb burger and the bison burger, with the delicious sweet potato fries or even the regular fries which usually come nicely herbed. But the BEST part of C'est What is washing down allo that food with a beer from the Great Lakes Brewery.

Their Christmas selection of beer is probably my favourite, with the Festive (?) one, spiced with nutmeg, being my absolute favourite. They do have an orange-y light lager that is pretty refreshing as well.

And to those people complaining about the noodle dishes, it's the equivalent of going to a Chinese restaurant and getting a burger, srriously."}
{"text":"First off, this place needs new signage - it looks like a cheap old internet cafe. 

C'est What has a good beer selection which is great. But...unfortunately the food isn't so great. I had the vegetarian roti which was basically just half-boiled potatoes wrapped in a roti. Not satisfying at all. 

I'm not opposed to going back but certainly won't recommend it or go back on my own will. If someone recommends it for the beer menu and I'm in the area, then maybe I'll stop by. You can do better though in TO."}
{"text":"This bar is fine, beer and drinks as you would hope, only eaten here once and had the lamb burger which I would thoroughly recommend! The decor is a bit drab but its a bar...reminds me of a typical old mans bar back in Scotland but without all the old men :D"}
{"text":"Visited two times. This is comfort food but its UNIQUE. They do multicultural/diverse comfort food and they do it well.

Also, every entree is under $20. Score! I think they served a lot of different types of beers as I see office workers ordering round and round.

Some of their unique offerings include chicken naan burgers, moroccan stew, jambalya, lamburgers, rotis, and chicken fingers with frites. Make sure to order their sweet potato chips as a side as it was delicious.

While I visited, I noticed a sign on the table saying they make their food fresh from scratch using real ingredients, so I like enjoyed that aspect of them caring about freshness/quality and not just reheating frozen entrees like Moxies, etc.

The atmosphere here is dimly lit, lots of wood, casual pub style. I like this place!"}
{"text":"I spent 40 bucks in one minute but I can't play one billiards match at 1am...? The bartender was a dick about it. Really big dick."}
{"text":"Oh, C'est What. I want to love you. And yet...

The beer selection is great. Particular care is taken to showcase the best local beers - and wine and cider too.   The menu is a step or two above average pub food and is particularly good for vegetarian options.

Unfortunately, I've been here a few times where the service has been so appallingly rude that I've sworn I'd never again darken the door of the place. I go back because I live nearby and it''s the best place open late, but I'm never sure how things are going to go. It's usually ok if I'm alone or with one other person and it isn't crowded, but basically, they don't like groups. I've made the mistake of coming here with groups of friends at the end of the week and just - don't. They treat you like they're doing you a huge favour by letting you in, and the bouncer comes over and threatens you for such crimes as getting up to talk to someone who's sitting at the other end of the table.  I got upset enough once to talk to the manager, who called me \"sweetie\" and let me know that \"I didn't pay his salary.\" (Um...what?) 

As long as you don't \"inconvenience\" the staff by showing up  with more than 3 other people, you can expect service to range from ok or even friendly-ish  to \"hipper-than-thou.\" I'd like this place a lot more if they didn't act like they were doing me such a favour by letting me spend my money there."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

C'est What? Beer! That's what! 

C'est what is what I imagine any good bar to be. The atmosphere is laid back; the place is spacious with plenty of tables that can easily accommodate a large group. I came here for my birthday celebrations and they had no sweat fitting a group of about 10. This bar is a great place to go with a large group of people, the atmosphere makes it great to just chill and have a conversation, as well as share a few laughs with friends. 

Their beer list is the main draw; they have quite an extensive tap list including some house made brews. You can truly find a beer for anyone's palate. The staff was quite nice and seemed to know their beer well; they also allow you to sample a beer before committing to a whole pint. They do have a food menu, but none of us ate on this day. 

My only qualm with this place was that although the beer list was extensive there was nothing really unique about it (aside from the house made brews). They do not have any exotic beers and I did find myself having a hard time choosing a beer, nothing was jumping out at me. I did try their house beers which were okay but nothing special. 

The place itself is located in a basement but has a rustic feel. It's open, spacious and well lit, you would have no inkling you were in a basement. The washrooms were ridiculously clean, this is always a sign that an establishment cares about its clients. 

This place may not be near the top in terms of beer selections in Toronto but nonetheless it is a great place to chill and have a few beers. I will be returning."}
{"text":"I completely agree with the review earlier today. This is not a place for large groups. Our groups experience is eerily similar. We (group of 10) came to 'C'est what?' this evening at 7pm to celebrate a coworker's achievement. The hostess (short redish hair) was very unaccommodating toward our large group and answered our questions with a bad attitude. As the 11th and 12th member of our group joined the party, the hostess insisted that they sit at a separate table. She refused to even let them turn their chairs toward us. She said \"you can sit here or you can leave\". 
In stark contrast, Jeff our server is awesome and came to check on us regularly. He had great recommendations on food and drinks."}
{"text":"We stopped at this pub, it was the first pub on a pub crawl. We had the Duggans #9 here, and I tried some of the Organic Hemp Beer. This is a very good brewpub. The staff was knowledgeable, and friendly. The atmosphere was nice, and overall it was an excellent experience. I did not have any food here, so I cannot say anything about the food. However, I definitely would go back to this establishment given the chance."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last week now... once on Saturday for casual drinks for a friend's birthday and again last night to grab a bite to eat as I constantly hear ranting and raving about the food.... the place itself is home-y with fireplaces and pool tables, separate rooms with bars in different areas - kinda has a high school cafeteria feel and look to it as one of my buddies pointed out... 

The food was actually delicious and hit the spot for all 3 of us as we were enjoying our craft beverages ... we got the homemade taziki and hummus, a side of coleslaw and the famous goat roti.. mmmmmm is all I have to say....

My only issue with this place is the fact that I felt like I was talking to a wall all night either trying to get the bartender(s) attention.... or opinion on either a menu item or craft beer. I get that not everyone wants to talk to their guests...and that wasn't what I was looking for as I was in fine company among my own friends... however, if you work at a bar that has a 4 page menu on beer alone, you bet your ass you best be prepared to talk about it or at least offer a slightly convincing opinion that tricked me into thinking you actually gave a shit. There was no sense of urgency behind the bar... it's Friday people...pick up your feet... and I'm pretty sure the menu had more personality than the guy serving me. Just saying. What a shame (as he was kinda cute to boot...) but seriously made me want to get my bill and leave. 

The food may be good enough to bring me back for a second shot...but I'll probably get takeout and sit in front of the wall at home rather than at the bar here...it's pretty much the same thing."}
{"text":"A really good bar in what seems to be a pretty generic scene in this area of Toronto. 

There are a couple things that I feel really set it apart from your average bar:

- The really extensive selection of Canadian brews, and the very informative menu that goes with it. I was really impressed that it even shows you how bitter each beer is to help you make a selection you'll enjoy.
- The sort of underground cave thing it has going on. It's got stone walls, and it feels like you're drinking in a cellar. Very nice.

The service we got was friendly and attentive. On a Friday night the place was pretty packed - enough to be fun but not overly loud or to have any wait times for tables. They have a pool table, which I always love in a bar. Prices were not bad either. I would definitely want to return if I found myself in this hood again."}
{"text":"C'est What is a great little spot located in the cellar of a historic old builing in the St. Lawrence Market area of Toronto. 

I've been there a couple of times, once after a concert and once to see my friend play a concert, and both experiences were most enjoyable. 

The classic, romantic and dark feeling of the bar really adds some personality to C'est What. Then you've got the 35 beers on tap, pool tables, and a TV room and this place becomes your home away from home. 

It also attracts a rather random crowd - busy bay street business types and hip toronto scensters are gather in revelry to enjoy some fresh beer, tasty food and hopefully so great live music. 

From a musical perspective, this is a great place to perform. There's a seperate room located across from the main area with good acoustics, a nice stage and a sound guy to help you out on your musical journey! Plus there's tons of seating and a bar just for little old you. 

This is a great, old area to visit and C'est What embodies that rich, historic ambiance to a tee!"}
{"text":"Don't know what people are talking about, service was great & very friendly! Also love the pool tables. Iced tea comes pre-sweetened unless you ask. 
    I came for the food & I was very happy! Menu had clearly marked vegan, gluten-free, & dairy-free if you're looking for that. Tried black bean wrap: fresh, tasty, healthy!
    Partner had the bison burger- fantastic! Lean & delicious with a perfect bun. 
    Great place!"}
{"text":"On a leisurely afternoon lunch date with two lovely ladies, we thought we would hit up C'est What for a bite. I've been on this low carb kick lately but decided to take a break on my lifestyle change provided the fare was worth it.

 I have to say that my \"Club What\" was totally worth it - mostly because of the delicious little side of some sort of spicy mayo thing that I pretty much ate with a spoon - don't you judge me, it's hard not eating bread! My friend got a pulled pork sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries that she had to smack my hand away from, and my other friend had some sort of great looking bean burger.

All in all for the grand total of $40 for a late lunch in the market I'd check it out again!"}
{"text":"Real casual.

Two words that first came to mind when I walked in.

Came here with a friend on Saturday night for some birthday drinks. 

A good variety of beers to choose from. If you're not a beer lover, don't fret - wines and mixed drinks are available too.

Pub grub is served too. Pretty good too!

Yay, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Pub muito agradável. Cardápio extenso de cervejas com preço justo. Menu de comida com bastante variações como hambúrguer, costela, poutine, nachos, salada, frango, etc. Tem música ao vivo. Você pode optar por ficar no ambiente com a música ou em outro mais reservado. Recomendo!"}
{"text":"Last night tried this place again.our last visit here left us a bit wary  but it could have been an off night

we stopped in to get an early bite and a drink before heading back to the hotel to get dressed for an evening at massey hall.

when we arrived the place had just opened it seemed, and we were the only ones there.. we sat at the bar, ordered a few beers  and some appetizers to share.

.the food arrived.. and ,  this time a 'stone' in the hummus made its way through quality control onto my plate and into my mouth!.. No manager ever came to see or explain.
Plus the gathering staff discussed whether I'd brought the gem stone from home..within earshot!..the plate was taken off my bill..and luckily I didn't crack a tooth!.
which would have been a lot worse for everyone involved.
whats bothering me the most is the complete lack of courtesy & concern. being in the service industry  , means  SERVICE.. or start looking for a new job when this place shuts its doors.

fyi.. im almost 50 yrs old...and the very very last thing id ever consider is not paying for what ive consumed.  i paid the bill.. and left a tip as a matter of fact.


.totally fed up with the lack of concern shown here.and in my opinion the foods sliding downhill too..definitely stay away from here when there are so many better choices and staff!!!"}
{"text":"I entered this fine establishment very late on a Wednesday and was delighted to see a band entertaining the patrons as they enjoyed micro brews and wore funny glasses on their faces.  I found a secluded, quiet section to sit and ordered the poutine.  My goodness, fellow readers this dish is something extraordinary.

Never have I tasted something so incredible.  I even took a picture of it with my smart phone - an act I find disgusting and inexcusable.  After finishing my poutine I said to the server \"Bring me another dish good sir!\".  He ignored me.  My check came and as I strolled out I realized the band had stopped playing and C'est What had Leonard Cohen playing on the stereo.  

It was 1AM, I was full and feeling unstoppable.  The next day I had a horrendous stomach ache..."}
{"text":"Had many events and parties here. Easy to have a good old time/gathering of multiple people without much hassle. Plenty of beer and food options to select from. Have enjoyed the times I have been here."}
{"text":"The food and service is okay. I had the morrocan stew that comes with naan and coucous. The couscous was very bland, and the naan was soft, white and doughey- nothing special. Tomatoes, chickpeas, raisins, carrots etc. Stew nothing special in terms of flavours. Presentation was nice though. My friend had the butter chicken, which was creamy and very flavourful!

This place is very unique to the decor. Exposed bricks and low ceiling, artworks, pool table, bar and some board games in the front. Went during the day so not many customers, but the waitress' service was okay. She didn't ask if we needed anything, if the food was okay or if we were ready for the bill.

Overall, food, service was meh. Great environment though. 3/5."}
{"text":"Petit bar/resto en basement, mais vraiment sympa! Fier de son succès il faudra attendre 1h pour avoir une table mais pendant ce temps c'est difficile de trouver une petite place pour se poser (même au coins de la cheminé style chalet français bien sympa) 

Plats bons à prix raisonnables donc c'est sympa et on y passe un bon moment!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now for drinks, and finally for dinner.  As soon as i walked in the first time, I knew I'd be back.  Tucked away in the basement of a building on Front street, it feels cozy, casual and warm.  The beer selection is good, and the wine selection is better than I would have thought.  
The food was pretty mediocre, though the fries were delicious (and PLENTIFUL!)  I ordered a chicken wrap, and it was served warm, which I felt was weird to eat warm lettuce, but maybe that's just me.  Apart from the A-OK wrap, everything else was good.  I'd check it out again for dinner, and will definitely come back for a drink."}
{"text":"Maybe this guy had a bad day, but our server was the utmost pits and made our experience here memorable in the saddest way. When someone at our table ordered a universally-known cocktail, his response was \"I don't know what that is\"....I mean, at least fake it and pull up your phone when you leave the table to google it. And then the food comes, but it's the wrong food, not to mention an incomplete order. We had to wave down another server to see if and when the other order was coming. On top of that, the guy kept coming to our table with another table's order...there's table numbers on those tickets right? I dunno, man...this place is already an outdated member in its neighborhood, but to have poor service from a guy with a serious chip on his shoulder slamming plates down on our table was beyond atrocious. The food is mediocre at best. I think we would have enjoyed it slightly more had the service had been a little more chipper and knowledgeable. (insert thumbs down and sad face emoji)"}
{"text":"We hit C'est What whenever we're in town.  Great beer selection, including several brewed on-premises; food that is a step up from the usual pub grub, like the lamb burger with tzatziki; comfortable tables, as well as couches and loungers.  We like to kick back, borrow their backgammon set (they have a number of games on hand) and chill with some beers.  Also a nice music venue adjacent."}
{"text":"This place has the worst server Joan. This older lady bartender Joan has no customer service skills at all. We went in as a big group for lunch. There were about 25 people and they told us if we would like to pay separately, we would have to order and pay at the bar. Oh btw there was no big table to fit all the people together. So we sat at 4 different tables. One of the guys called in advance and told them how many people would be going and they said they could accommodate under 25 people without any problems!  My table decided to pay separately and I went to the bar to order. This bartender lady told me to go back, she would come to my table. I said we were told to order here, that was when she started giving me attitude. When she took my order, she even gave me a dirty look! She probably even spit in my food based on her customer service skills. She never came to our table until we finished and she came to give us the bill. She's one of those people you hate in general not mention when she's your server. When I was paying, I asked if the tip was shared and the answer was yes. So I had to tip 15% but seriously I wouldn't have tipped at all if it wasn't shared tips. 

The food portion is tiny other than the burgers. My coworker ordered the goat stew, and he finished in like 5 bites. Another coworker ordered pulled pork poutine and it was tiny too for 14 bucks. 

Overall, this place is not a good value place to come. I will never return! I suggest everyone to stay away from this restaurant too to avoid their crappy server!"}
{"text":"sorry to say that my most recent visit was pretty bad.. . the service was okay but food quality was just not up to par. 

The crab and shrimp cakes used to be my favorite - love it so much that i order it EVERY single time im here - today was no exception. when i first sank my fork in to the cake to split it in half i knew something was wrong - it was a ball of mashed potato with peas, and one sad little shrimp. well from what i remember about two months ago and many visits before that: the crab cakes have a lot of yummy crab meat and shrimp chucks. Skeptical, i still took a few bites tryin to convince myself \"NOOO there's no way, this is the best!\" needless to say, i was super disappointed, so disappointed that i had to send the food back (okay pls i NEVER send food back).

So either there was a change in recipe, or a change in supplier for the crab/fish cakes, this meal was awful. especially the fish cakes were pretty much the main reason i come here. 

on a side note: we also got the pulled pork sandwich... which was quite flavorless. we upgraded the side fries to poutine but the chef didn't think about... maybe the gravey will soak the sandwich bun and make it hard to eat, so we ended up with soaked buns. two separate plates would've solved this problem easily

in the end i still went to say hi to the little replacement catfish in the aquarium. this visit, i was disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is much cooler at night! I initially came here a couple months ago for lunch. They have a surprising selection of ethnic food (the name is French so a little deceiving) I tried the vegetarian roti-great serving size!

Last night, I returned to C'est What? for their International Music Night. Turns out this is a great venue to check out local bands. What I like about their shows is that the bar is pretty spread out, you find a spot in front of the band, or if you want a quieter spot, the place is split into different sections with plenty of extra seating. It was pretty busy last night.

The bands were great! The last band playing Wool and Howl were awesome! As was the reggae inspired band (sorry don't recall their name).

C'est What lists all their upcoming events on their websites. I would recommend this place as a casual place to eat and drink (someone mentioned the beer selection is good-I'm not a big beer drinker so can't comment). Also a good spot to bring out-of-towners looking for a comfortable Toronto experience."}
{"text":"Came here for a \"late\" dinner last night (around 9PM on a Saturday) and saw the place at near max capacity for the 1st time! It definitely has a different vibe versus daytime - it's much more like a pub/co-ed watering hole at night. The crowd is very mixed with a lot of people in their 20s and 30s hanging out at the bar alone or in pairs and tables of larger groups of all ages. They have board games and playing cards available and I saw groups utilizing these while waiting for their food, so that was interesting :)

Tips-
1. Bring your official ID /since they card everyone at the door regardless of whether you'll be drinking or not.
2. Hence, kids and families this place is not for you in the later evenings
3. Don't order their salads = sad and small, so you're better off ordering their apps or mains
4. Noise level is quite loud, had to shout at my partner at times for him to hear me"}
{"text":"If you like beer, C'est What should be on your Toronto list. It's not that the beers here are outrageously good or creative, but the place is doing something unique on a scale that no other beer joint in town is doing: brewing and selling a massive variety of their own beers. Some are great, some are not-so-great, but they all warrant a try. The place is huge with several rooms that lends the restaurant area a cozy house-like feel, making it great for large groups. The food is above-average in selection and quality for a bar - awesome poutine and dishes with a Middle Eastern flair. Nothing fancy or ultra chic: homey, fun and unique."}
{"text":"If I were to describe this pub in one word, it would be \"Cozy\".

There are plenty of places to sit whether it be on a stool, at a table or on a couch, this place offers you choices. In addition, the layout lends itself to larger groups if you're with a number of friends.

They also have a pool table if you want to mix a bit of games with your drinks and there is a small section when live artists can perform.

This big draw of the place is there wide selection of craft beers. There's enough variety and selection for you to try something you're familiar with or to be adventurous.

I've only ate here a couple of times but the food was pretty good.

If you're in the St. Lawrence Market area or on a layover at Union Station, this place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"C'est What is a great beer-bar, a place for beer snobs, beer lovers, and beer drinkers to rejoice in their collective passion for hoppy (or malty, or whatever) suds!  This place is everything the Rhino is not:  excellent service, clean taps, clean space, comfortable seating, tasty food...

Sure, it's located in what essentially amounts to a basement, but I never really felt like i was chillin' in someone's dank and dirty.  The place is spacious, well laid out, and lit just shy of atmospherically (not sure what that means exactly, but I hope you catch my drift).

The beer list is not insane, but I appreciate that -- there's not a bad choice to be found, and the seasonals and cask offerings are yum, every one.  I was particularly fond of their house chocolate stout!

But while C'est What will never stray from its beery roots, it's the food that really struck me.  As pub food goes, they have some great options:  I highly recommend the house-made veggie burger w/ yam fries, made with ancient grains, chick pea, and more.  Awesome.  One of the best veggie burgs I've ever had, pub or no pub, though it bears mentioning that the patty is deep-fried.  So much for the healthy option!  As for those yam fries, man, delicious, even if they do range from crispy to floppy depending on the chip.  Texture didn't matter much, they tasted that good.

Finally of note, C'est What doesn't, as a general rule, offer tastings of their beer... but they will, if you ask nicely.  And \"a taste\" amounts to probably 5oz, so I understand why they're reluctant.  So again, ask nicely, thank kindly, and tip well, and they'll be more than happy to give you a few nips of what's on tap to help educate your decisions.  Plenty of time for beer-blind choices later!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and seems to be a hip place to be. The restaurant is located down the stairs and underground. It's kind of odd that they don't take reservations but usually you get a seat on walk-ins. They have a decent food menu with a good selection of appetizers and entrees. I mostly ordered appetizers. I ordered the classic poutine and the potatoes skin with dip. I didn't find the potatoes skins dip very appetizing at all and the poutine was just alright. As for drinks, their selection is pretty good as they have many kinds of beers on tap, cask beers, wines, cider and much more to cater to everyone's drinking needs! Overall, a decent place to grab a bite in the St. Lawrence Market area."}
{"text":"Drinks were decent. Service was good. Tons of drinks to choose from. This place is perfect for grabbing some beers with colleagues."}
{"text":"We are a couple of beer lovers and tend to seek out beer spots whenever we travel.  My bf spotted this place before leaving on our trip and had it on his list of places we must try.  We came here for an early evening dinner after tiring ourselves out with wandering Toronto by foot all-day.  This place has a very cavernous feel to it as you have to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the dining and bar area.  There's plenty of space for large parties and cozy enough for folks to explore their beer selection.  I thought most of their drafts sound interesting but was disappointed to hear they did not offer a sampler of any sort.  Instead, we went with a house-made coffee porter and a blackberry wheat (which was not made in-house).  Both brews were fine but nothing worth writing home about.  However, for dessert the bf opted for a pint of their Chocolate Orange beer which was really interesting and tasty.  The service was attentive and the food was okay.  I really liked all their vegetarian options but unfortunately I went with a bland jambalaya and he went with a bison burger.  Skip the dishes we ordered and come by for a great take on craft beers."}
{"text":"Everybody on Yelp loves this place, and now I know why! We went for drinks and apps last week and had a great time. The food is not stellar, but it's decent pub food and good for sharing. What I especially liked was the server, who was an authority on the vast beer list, and really helpful with descriptions of them. Plus, he convinced me to try the in-house cask ale, and now I am a huge fan. I will be back to try more of these casks beers. Recommend!"}
{"text":"C'est What is a rather unique Pub in the heart of downtown Toronto. Their selection of beers is quite decent and so is their food menu. Although this place is not in my Toronto's Best list, I would still recommend it and especially if you go for a bit to eat. My suggestion will be the Lamb Burger, a must have.  Only advice is to stay away from the Sweet Potato fries as these tend to be on the greasy side. Other than that, the regular fries and onion rings are great."}
{"text":"My much more \"in the know\" friend introduced me to this place, and I'm happy she did. Have only been once so far, but I can see why it's highly rated. Good beer selection, although I think I had a boozy coffee myself. And the naan with hummus, which was warm and fresh and delightful. Prices were very reasonable and the whole place has a great energy and vibe. I really enjoyed hanging out on the couch by the fireplace..."}
{"text":"Go here for the beer, but not the food. The beer selection is pretty good, and reasonably priced.

The food is a different story. The menu has a vegetarian section, but some of the options just sounded really off-putting. I decided on a veggie soup and yam fries. The latter was much better than the former, which was flavourless. I couldn't really tell what the soup had in it.....yay mystery meals? Not really.

The restaurant has an inviting atmosphere, and there are musical performances sometimes.

So, if I went here again, i'd probably just get a beer and some fries.....I'll stay away from the other food."}
{"text":"Very groovy place that I haven't been to in years and I'm not sure why. I work nearby and even though there are plenty of options in the Harbourfront / Esplanade / Union Station area, a lot of them are either fairly pedestrian or don't really cater to the vegetarian in the crowd (i.e. me). Okay, I guess that's not really fair...there are a lot of good places, I'm just picky (and a vegetarian). Plus I was taking a friend out for dinner after work to ask him to be in my wedding party so I wanted to impress at least a little bit. He's more hip than I am (at least when it comes to food) so that meant no Jack Astor's, no Fionn MacCool's and no to any of the places that severely limit my dining options. So C'est What? is what (what?) I settled on!

They had a bouncer dude (which can always be a little off putting, I won't lie) but he was friendly and kindly told me that I should go inside to wait for my buddy rather than loiter outside, seeing as they were having a beer tasting that night and it would very soon be packed! I haven't even stepped inside and I'm already liking this place!  

After thinking about it though for a minute we didn't even end up technically doing the tasting thing...it's just too complicated. You have buy tickets and then you trade the ticket (or two or three depending on the beer) for a little mini cup and then you keep track of which ones you like and rate them...you get the point (or not). This is getting to be too much work and will surely cut into our drinking time. So how's about just getting half pints of whatever looks cool and going from there? Sounds good to me. 

So after perusing the incredibly impressive beer menu we decided to basically stick with cask ales and go with as many as we could. Most were winners, some were disappointments and I'll be damned if I can remember what was good and what wasn't. I took a blurry photo of the list but I probably should have done so AFTER we marked it up with our ratings. Oh well. At any rate most of them aren't on their regular beer menu, although they do have an impressive regular list as well as rotating taps. And they're all Canadian and mostly local. Very cool.  

Of course I've now completely forgotten to mention the food that initially drew me here but then again a good selection of beer tends to do that. I went with the Adobo Black Bean Burger and it was quite good. Not your standard soy, meat analogue veggie burger and also not loaded with mushrooms (for which I was thankful). Very tasty and not at all dry. My friend had the Buffalo Burger (he approved) and both the regular and sweet potato fries were very yummy. 

Service was fine despite the busy night and they were even good enough to secure my attaché case that I had half-drunkenly left behind. I guess my one minor knock is that our server wasn't super knowledgeable about the beer list but I'll chalk this up to the fact that a lot of them weren't typically on the menu.

So must definitely come back to C'est What? and will probably make it my go-to place for after work beer and grub. Too bad they can't have a beer tasting every day!"}
{"text":"I love this place, but don't get there very often.  This weekend we went there for lunch.  I had what I truly believe was the best pemeal sandwich EVER. Brioche bun, good peameal, old cheddar, lettuce, fried egg, fried crispy onions and onion chutney. SO AMAZING.

Worth checking this place out."}
{"text":"They have one of the best selections of local beer in Toronto.
Good vegetarian / vegan selection on their menu, the veggie burger is great and the fries are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Interesting place. I really like the atmosphere. It's kind of cramped, but it's brightly lit, not too loud, and really cozy. It's the type of place you want to visit with a few of your friends to catch up.

Definitely the best thing about this place is their selection of drinks. They have some classic choices (Steamwhistle beer) to some downright weird stuff (I had this coffee-flavoured beer that was... unique, to say the least). If you're an adventurous drinker, this is a great place for you.

However, the food was mediocre at best. I had one of their more popular choices: the Lamburger. I understand that lamb, in its core, is a dry type of meat, but the burger was pretty tasteless. It wasn't even a burger - it was served on a pita. Why? Why call it a \"Lamburger\"? But I digress. The dishes my friends had were pretty decent, but nothing to write home about particularly.

In short, I definitely like this place. Go for the drinks; skip the food."}
{"text":"Such a loser of a place! Fascist style rude and unpleasant staff who are amateurs at best!"}
{"text":"Who would think to find a small underground bar hidden away on Front St? Came here for a good night to unwind and relax. This place serves the typical pub food but has a fantastic selection of craft beers and rotating taps. All the food and drinks were very reasonably priced and good.

It's a large underground space good for a casual meeting up with friends over drinks or even a game of pool (at $15 an hour it's as good as it gets.) or a first date depending on how low key your date is. I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I like this place for its selection of beer, space and general pub feel. They always have top notch craft brews and casks.

They got some pool tables that are always fun. It's a general good place to hang out. If you can't walk stairs, don't bother with this place as it's located down a flight of stairs.

Tables can be hard to get as there are a good amount of people. But I guess if you drinking, you don't need to sit.

Parking around the area can be free after 9p, otherwise the Green P to the south is a good option.

I feel like this place though is not always the most consistent respect to service. They are knowledgeable and often friendly. But then you often get a bit of cheekiness or lack of interest if you aren't \"in the know\" with beers.

With that said, I'd still come here for beers. Who cares, I get my beer, and service defines the return."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday, we had a group of 8, the hostess said it would be a while, so we waited near the bar. 
To our surprise we were seated within 5 minutes!

One of our friends raved about this place so we figured we'd give it a go.
Service is lackluster as our server seemed like he was very high, completely spaced out.

The food however was amazing, I wasn't expecting much but I was blown away.
I had the pulled pork and fries and it was delicious.
I have no idea what spice that's on the fries but it was amazing.
The pulled pork was done well, melt in your mouth delicious.

I would definitely come back for the food, hope to get a better server next time.

One end note, they will not separate bills, do not have debit and if your with a group of 6 or more, they add a 17% auto gratuity to the bill."}
{"text":"The menu has great variety and I love the local aspect of the ingredients. Also a good selection of vegetarian and vegan options. Really cool atmosphere and vibe, great for a casual date night or afternoon game of pool. My only complaint is that the three times I have been here, the draught is consistently flatter than I've ever had before. The cider was hardly drinkable...more like boozy apple juice. For carrying such an amazing lineup of beer, I would anticipate a better pour."}
{"text":"So three girls walking around needed to find a place to eat and catch up... we come across the doors of C'est What and cannot open the door whatsoever.... we're wondering how this place can be closed on a weekday at 6 o'clock.

Warning... PULL DOOR HARD!

Finally realizing our stupidity, we walked down the stairs to this cool little pub with tvs across the bar, and tables for people to either watch the games or just socialize. A very casual atmosphere I must say as the service was not too attentive, but maybe my girls and I were talking too much to notice anything at all around us.

I ordered the shepherds pie which I was told was delicious.... the girls ordered stews. It came out in a huge ceramic plate, and the only thing I could see was melted cheese.. not going to lie, not sure if it was real or processed, but it looked too much for my liking. The flavours were standard, nothing out of the ordinary and nothing beer soaked as I might have read.

The beer selection was decent, although one of us thought their choice was very unenjoyable. It's hit and miss really. Not bad for a chill night and good catch up times! Prices are very reasonable for food and the location is bang on."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Toronto - hands down. It's a very cozy atmosphere - you have to go down to a basement level and that's where the bar is. If you're already drunk, the stairs are steep - watch yo'self!

I've been here about 6-7 times, every single time it was good. Once we had a problem with a waitress who kept bringing us silver tequila rather than golden and we had to send the shots back like 3 times...first world problems amiright??? 

The food is great, i've has the burger almost every time and it was your standard, pub-like burger. Nothing special but it's not like C'Est Bon is known for its fine grade A beef...

The interior is nice, there is a pool table, couches, tables, bar, a fireplace (not sure if it's working?). The walls are uneven stone which gives it a cottage-y feel. Bands play here regularly, mostly indie and folk (damn those hipsters :P ). 

SO many beers on tap....so many. I can't recite, seriously.... On top of that, it's ALL CANADIAN! I don't like Canadian-made beer, sorry - i'm picky. But whatever, it's good to support your local breweries blah blah blah so it's fine, don't get prissy cuz they ain't got dat super rare German brewski.

{"text":"During our time here we have had a pleasure eating and enjoying friends. We had a awesome time here. I absolutely love the selection of beers. The staff is amazing and very welcoming. This js definitly our spot when we are here in Toronto."}
{"text":"its real sneaky this place.

i wonder about its first days, when all people had to go by was a dinky sign leading to a basement, where no one could see all the great cheer that was flowing beneath the ground like a creeping quake about to strike.

when you manage to descend into the deep of c'est what (and i saw a lady haul her stroller down their flight of about 30 stairs) you feel like youve just crawled into some underground den to store drugs or refugees or something sinister.  but it actually FEELS nor LOOKS anything like that. 

when you enter you actually feel like someone built their cottage underground.  you can go in every possible direction it seems like.  go to the right and youll be amongst tables that can witness firsthand live music.
go straight to the back and you can cozy up near the fireplace which has in front of it a large yet very short table that separates the seats that surround it.  if not for the couches, you could slap some pillows around and it might be the perfect place to eat sushi.  go to your left and theres a long bar filled with handfuls of draught beer and you are pretty much guaranteed to try something youve never tried before.  that space is surrounded by more chill out spaces, and i believe i witnessed some pool tables...could be wrong on that one though.

the food we had was great pub food, the service was quick, polite and with good humour.  i havent been here in a while since this time and im glad to have been reminded."}
{"text":"I want to like this place a lot but I find it quite hard too as every time I've gone here I've been disappointed. Severely.

This basement bar is full of beer. Lots of it, which is why I want to like it. There are different pints from different places with a nice mixed crowd to boot. 

The decor is average. Small reddish wood tables and chairs, a nice big bar, dull lighting, a few pool tables at the back, and a lot more carpet than you would expect.

The food here is food. Let's just say it tastes just how it looks. Sometimes under seasoned and other time way over seasoned. It's nothing fancy so I don't get how it is just so sub par but it is a bar known for beers after all. Shame they couldn't serve up some nice food to go along with the great beer selection. 

Service here is blindingly slow. We're talking turtle speed. No wait. A turtle with arthritis and missing one of its legs speed. The beer and food barely crawl into your hands. On top of that the service is just non existent. Wait staff don't care nor can they bother to. They are doing their job and I think they hate it. 

It makes me angry that I don't love this place. I mean, there is a huge beer selection. It is very hard for me to not like a place with great beers to choose from. C'est What? managed to do it though. Sad, really.

Overall, this place is super cheap for drinks and food. The price of food reflects the quality but the same cannot be said for the beers. Come to drink the night away on a small budget but you might want to stop off somewhere else for food. Service is dismal so seat yourself at the bar so you can at least see that someone is pouring your beer.

C'est What?
C'est fail, that's what."}
{"text":"C'est What has been around since the 1990s. It was on the craft beer trend two decades ago. Toronto is pretty behind the 30 craft beers tap on trend but C'est What does a fair imitation. Despite a primo location, C'est What is not over priced. A great 1/2 lbs lamb burger and fries is $14. Service is really friendly and attentive. The only down side is it's a basement location. Bars that are located in basements tend to have that \"this is where Chemistry grad students come to drink\" feel but C'est What actually offers a cozy English style pub space without pretending to be an English style pub. High marks all around."}
{"text":"food wax okay, service was sh!t.  I don't know if I'd go back. beer list is long bug mostly hipster beer, concentration on non-normal beer types: cask aged, gravity (read:flat) and the like.  whatever, I like a bitter beer, not really impressed over all.

drink here, of don't. whatever."}
{"text":"Want a cool and wide range of beer in one place?  Well, you're in luck!!!

If you're not watchful, you'll literally walk right by this place.  That's what I did with a few co-workers as we were trying to find this joint.  It's literally a door on the street; you've got to watch for it!  You enter the doors, walk down the a long flight of stairs and walk into the dining/bar area.  There are two bars setup and dining tables all around.  We found our way straight to the bar and planted ourselves for an evening of good drinks and great convo.  

If you love beer, then this place is for you.  They don't exactly serve the crappy mainstream stuff; instead, they have a ton of local and micro brew beers to choose from.  I landed on the Steve's Dreaded Chocolate Orange brew.  Super flavorful, you get a hint of orange right at the beginning and end on a chocolate flavor.  I put down a few pints :-)

This place has quite the selection, some interesting characters to chat with and decent prices that won't leave you with a sour taste in your mouth.

Do the right thing and make your way to this place."}
{"text":"You know, it's nice seeing a place grow up.  In the early days that I knew it, it had well-worn couches, backgammon and chess tables, and a clutch of board games you could bring to the table to play while you enjoyed a pint.  Surrounded by the basement rock and brick, it felt like you were drinking in a cellar and it had a nice bohemian echo to it.
My friend and I would go in after rough days work and enjoy a microbrew, but it seemed that there were a lot of rough days at that time.  Once I recall sitting at a table, turning to our usual server Pam and saying \"I've not had [insert tasty beer here] before, I'll try that.  Pam replied, \"Yeah, you did.  You've had that one.\"  \"No I didn't\", came my response.  \"Yes\", she rebutted, \"you sat over there and were going on about your clients.\"

\"Oh.  Well, I leave it to you then.\"

The place has now expanded from its very casual beginnings.  Where there used to be way-too-worn-out couches, there's a new dining area, an entire new wing and extra bar to house more tables and thankfully more patrons.  The menu remains eclectic with a great Pad Thai and lamburger found on the menu.  Try the antojitos when you go.  The recipe hasn't changed and they're still bloody tasty.

The beer is chiefly if not solely microbrews with a few of the C'est What? brew pub faves also available on tap.  It was tasty before and it remains tasty today.  The only thing that's' different is it's a little bit more adult."}
{"text":"Sooo many beers on the beer menu.. I'll definitely need to try many of them.. 

I tried the Rye Beer which was ok.. I like dark beers that don't taste heavy like they look and this is one of those...

I invited my friend over before we left town but she got confused and walked to another block so I only stayed for a short while (and hence this short review)."}
{"text":"Wish I had better things to say about C'est What - unfortunately, we left almost as soon as we arrived on my last visit. I've come to this bar in the past and the experience has been fine. A few weeks ago, I had the unpleasant experience of being greeted by their unpleasant and annoying security guard. She seemed to be on a power trip unnecessarily but after some dialogue she let us in. Not so bad, and you could argue she was just doing her job (but in my opinion, she was over the top and seemed to be seeking attention). Last night I returned with friends, she stopped me and my friend, speaking to us both saying we've had too much to drink (we were sober and didn't do anything to indicate we weren't). She then directed her interrogation to my friend, and grilled him for about 3-4 minutes at the front entrance. Honestly, if she wanted to turn us away she should have just said no entry. Instead, she went on and on, telling him she \"could tell\" he had been drinking and staring intensely at him, she said she didn't want him puking in the bathroom or falling asleep at the table, and finally ended up saying he said all the right things to make her think he wasn't drinking, that's he's convinced her. Again, he was sober. It was like the verbal equivalent of flexing her power just because she could. The two hostesses seemed uncomfortable with her as well. So we went in and sat at our table. My friend was too polite to say it at the time we were in the entrance, but he felt completely berated and harassed. He said he couldn't believe everything she kept saying even though he was just being understanding and agreeable. Once we had a chance to collect ourselves at the table, and realize how terrible our friend felt, we left. Since this is the second time I've had this negative experience with her specifically and because of her I will not be returning to C'est What, I wanted to share the experience hoping something good will come of this. It's unfortunate that this bar chooses to employ someone who is the sole reason they just lost 5 local patrons."}
{"text":"Only Canada can have a  French-English pun for a restaurant name....faux real.  

Anyway, this place has an excellent selection of microbrews:
Beer = 5 stars
Food = 3 stars
Service = 3 stars

The BEER selection is really quite good including some house-made options.  I'm not really sure where these microbrewery batches are produced by they do some rather interesting ones.  I really do like the large and extensive list of beers on tap.  Pretty much something for every taste.  

The FOOD selection and offerings were just a bit disappointing.  I had a shepherd's pie which really failed in the presentation department.  It sounded so good in the menu description: lamb and veggies cooked with coffee porter and topped with smoked cheddar.  It looked like someone had laid oily slices of melted process cheese all over the top of the dish.  The underwhelming cheese just dominated the flavors, and it could have been mystery meet instead of lamb.   My friend wasn't all that impressed with his offering either.  Portions are pretty generous, although I would happily traded some extra food for a little more quality.  

The SERVICE was just weird.  Despite being a very calm night, the server/bartender/(maybe he was cooking in back too) was very harried.  What was super frustrating though for 2 Americans new to the Toronto beer scene was that he basically just refused to make recommendations or engage in telling us about the beers.  That's tough when they're all new to you.  

Thankfully, the beer was good.  I'll give the dinner a try again and update my review....otherwise I'll be sticking to drinks here.  

An UPDATE: I find the hostess staff here obnoxious!  On subsequent visits, they've been so incredibly difficult.  Especially when seating a group.  They made tons of undeserved snarky comments and just acting like we were ruining their day by arriving with a group of 10, for which we had called ahead even.  I'm sorry that we're trying to give you our business.  So, don't come here with a group.

FYI: it's a basement restaurant, so little weird for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great beer selection here as mentioned in other yelp reviews. It's a nice place for a few drinks after work and seemed quite roomy for a basement location. The food is fairly average, nothing particularly outstanding... But this is the place for a beer with friends.
I'd return during the winter time, since it lacks a patio, and there are other establishments in the area to enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"Came here after the last Elite event.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the crowd seemed alright.  I tried the Hoptical Illusion beer which was fantastic.  Now I need to go back and try the recommended Hop Head."}
{"text":"A good basement bar to relax and catch up with friends after a rough day at work. There is a great selection of beers with descriptions to help figure out what to order for the night,  or just ask the helpful waiter with your beer preferences. I had a butter chicken poutine and a Joan's dark secret beer. The beer was good but the poutine was cold so the cheese didn't melt and detracted from the meal. Minus points there.  

There are several pool tables to kill some time with or you can hangout by the fire on the couches and have a beer. A good place to hide out for a couple hours."}
{"text":"FINALLY. FINALLY. I FINALLY GOT TO COME HERE. 

It was Labour Day, and I was hanging around downtown and met up with fellow Yelper, Jason C. I kept on saying that I wanted to go there, and I was in need of beer after a gruelling, busy long weekend.

Happily, they were opened! Not too many people, because it was long weekend. The service was awesome - exceptionally friendly.

Craft beers? Yes, please. You can't go wrong with a place with an awesome beer list. I love it. Had myself the Saint André Vienna Lager -- quiet smooth. I was quite happy.

Lamb burger?! Double yes please! I don't usually go for burgers, but my friend was recommending it to me (and it seems like Yelp was too)!  Absolutely delicious - however, quite filling to the point that you want to pass out in the end.  The yam frites are TO DIE FOR. I've never had yam frites made that way - and I was quite a happy camper.

I plan to come back again to check out the live music in the evenings.  Awesome place to hang out at."}
{"text":"Cheers! C'est What is quite cute and very intimate. I didn't try the food. There are two bars in the restaurant. My bartender was friendly and helpful. The host stand was a hangout location for staff not working. Weird. I had a C'est What pale ale. It was okay. The beer is a bit cloudy, there could be more pop of flavor, and there was a stale after-taste. Good thing was there was plenty on the bar menu so I wasn't limited. I had a yummy pale ale from Vermont also. I'd like to revisit and try some food. The beer selection was pretty good, so I could also try a different brew."}
{"text":"This place is more like a 3.5 star place. It's 4 stars for the beer selection, prices, board games, low volume background music conducive to conversing, and chill vibe. Three stars for the menu. The food is above average for a bar and more interesting than what you'd find at the Fox and Firkin pub clones. At the same time, the flavor could better match the menu description. The Staggering Pig sandwich with chipotle and red wine reduction au jus needed more flavor. Aside from the chipotle's heat, the au jus was bland. Maybe they need a better wine or more of it to reduce. I knew I shoulda got the lamb burger."}
{"text":"Great for beer and appetizers.

My boyfriend loves this place with a capital \"L\", because of the quiet private atmosphere and not-so-loud music (unless it is Friday night). I would love just as much if the food was better.

Food - 
Personally, the only items I enjoy are: burgers (lamburger, bison), fried sweet potatoes, calamari and poutine. You can skip the rest of the menu, it is really very not-so-good.

Fav food - 
Poutine. It is actually pretty amazing.

Drink - 
I love coffee porter, wheat beers, raspberry and apricot beers. Their beer is really good and high quality."}
{"text":"Food tastes amazing-home made.  Had the rib dinner followed by their apple pie.  Yummy!!!
Atmosphere awesome, parking just around the corner.  You gotta go!!! 2 pool tables in great shape - free to use."}
{"text":"I hate to rain on the love parade that seems to be happening around this place, BUT....I will.

Sure, it's cozy. 
And they've got all sorts of beers.
But 
they also seemed (the staff) pretty uptight during my visit. They seem really keen on reservations and even more specifically, reservations for a specific number of people. 

That's....a downer.

On the upswing their poutine is pretty good.....topped with green onions for an extra kick. Mmmmm......gravy."}
{"text":"C'est What was on our list of places to visit for our day drinking tour while walking around Toronto.  Located downstairs it could be easy to miss (we walked by it the first time) but it's a cozy environment with delicious food.

We tried the lamb burger with fries and it was so tasty!  So tasty.  Fries were perfectly crispy and hot.  There are many types of beers to try although I opted for a spike hot chocolate given the outdoor temperature.  There is a pool table and although the quarters are close, plenty of room to lounge and spend time with friends.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our original plan was to grab a bite at the St. Lawrence Market but that place was a zoo, of course, so we headed out onto Front to hit one of the many pubs. I'd been to C'est What before for a beer-tasting event and remembered liking the joint, so I figured this was as good a time as any to sample their eats.

We decided to share a couple of dishes:

Butter Chicken Poutine (\"Frites, butter chicken, cheese curds, almonds, mango chutney, diced green onions\"): I've had plenty of Butter Chicken poutines in my day but this was undoubtedly one of the best ones. The plentiful butter chicken was rich and flavorful, while the almonds and chutney added a very welcome depth of flavor. The generous serving of cheese curds and the tasty fries were the icing on the cake, essentially.

Pulled Pork Quesadilla (\"Pulled-pork shoulder, beer BBQ sauce, cheese, tomato-cilantro salsa, black bean roasted corn salsa\"): This was another above average dish. The sweet, tangy beer BBQ sauce was so flavorful and rich, while the various other toppings worked equally well. The pulled pork was tender and plentiful. And the accompanying nachos and guacamole were quite good, too.

I suppose my one complaint would be that the food didn't arrive hot. It was closer to warm. It was pretty disappointing, actually, because it was clear that the food would've been so much better had it been served at the correct temperature."}
{"text":"Mediocrity at best...

I was hearing some good things about this restaurant, and when I checked Yelp it was getting quite a high ranking. At one in the morning a couple friends and myself decided to check out what this place was about. After being carded on the way in, we were seated at a table that seemed like it was last thoroughly cleaned weeks before. Seeing as how it was really busy even at that time, it is probably just a very busy day and night, but at least when wiping down a table when customers leave you would think anything on the table would be shifted so that other people's mess does not just get pushed under everything. Some water and napkins later, we were ready to order food.

Having a really messed up sense of humour myself I took it as all good fun, but the waitress made some strong, personal jabs when asked about items on the menu. It almost felt like I was in a run down and seedier version of Star Bucks and should just know what everything is on my first visit. After no help from the waitress, I ended up going with The Staggering Pig with yam frites (well done) because I am always in the mood for some pulled pork, and a Hazelnut Chocolate Ale Beer Float to wash it all down. I had never had a beer float before, but I was feeling a little adventurous that night. To top the late night meal off, I went with the Hazelnut Brownie because...well...it's chocolate!

Where the chipotle or the coffee porter barbecue sauce was, I couldn't quite tell you. The pulled pork was rather bland and a little bit fatty, yet it was sufficiently moist. So moist in fact that I had to fork and knife it because even the bottom side of the bottom bun was too wet and greasy to handle. Like a roast beef dip, it came with something that was the consistency of jus on the side which is where any sense of flavour was stored, but it was way too thin to really give pulled pork that deep flavour. Some places just can't do it so I can't fault them, but the \"frites\" were not what one would call well done. When I first tasted the beer float, I didn't think much of it was a really weird combination. As the ice cream melted it became much better tasting. By the time I was half done it was actually a really good float.

The brownie is where they finally won me over. It was actually homemade and really good. Wasn't too rich, wasn't too thick, wasn't too cold; it was a great ending to a mediocre meal. The happy ending and the surprise of a real beer float is what gained them any sort of ranking. Overall not impressed, but seems like a good place for a late night dessert."}
{"text":"First, the positives - great beer selection and awesome service. What makes this just an a-ok review is the food. Some of the items were good - staggering pig sandwich, shepherd's pie - but others were a bit of a let-down - falafel, vegetable roti. This is a good option for this area of town, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the most pretentious places I've ever been to in my life. Because our party of five wanted separate bills we were very rudely told they could not do this in the dining room and they sat us in a dingy corner in the bar area. 

The hostess gave us menus, which implies table service. Didn't say otherwise anyway. We waited for 15 minutes and finally went up to the bar and they said again, rudely, you have to order from the bar. They wanted our credit card to run a tab as well. 

We decided at this point to leave. If the procedure had have been explained to us when we sat down that would have been one thing, but it was the utter rudeness and condescension we were met with every time we asked a question that sank this experience.

Disappointing because they have a great beer selection and the menu looked really good.

Also, the place was completely empty... You would think separate bills or not, they would have treated us with more respect. We went next door to Jack Astors where we were treated like the paying customers we were, with care and respect."}
{"text":"Great place to visit and quench your thirst. They have a beer for just about everyone! And whoever is naming their hand-crafted brews has an awesome imagination. Easy to find and terrific bartenders. If you're reading this then just plug the address in your GPS and GO! You won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"I would echo what many other reviewers have said: great beer selection, staff could be a tad more on the ball (although one night we sat at the bar and had a very nice and chatty bartender).

Food is hit and miss, but the hits are pretty great. The bison burger is amazing; there is so much flavour in the patty itself, it isn't just a vessel for toppings. Because of bison's leanness you should ask for it a little rarer. Another great choice that seems to be often overlooked is the shepherd's pie. The pulled pork sandwich should be avoided due to a very strange celery heavy sauce choice.

Pricing for food and beer is quite reasonable considering the quality. Mixed drinks, on the other hand, are shockingly expensive and made with middle of the road spirits. If you want something other than beer you should probably head elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, both times on a Sunday afternoon/evening. The genuine and friendly service, fireplaces and comfort food make this a really cozy spot in the winter. 

For an app I recommend the Herbed Frites with jalapeno mayo. I also really liked the Falafel, which came with tzatziki, red pepper hummus, flat bread and lentil salad. It was a great and filling meatless option and you could tell it wasn't an after-thought they just threw on the menu for vegetarians. 

The menu runs a little pricier than you might expect, with most menu items around $15. 

Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"I love their drinks selection. Especially the beers and ciders. The waitstaff were extremely attentive, organized, and nice. I went with a large group of 20 or so people and they did their best to accommodate. The place also has pool tables for $15 an hour. Super chill and unpretentious vibe but much older demographic (30+ year olds)."}
{"text":"Great beer selection!!! Very nice atmosphere
I was very comfortable being there with a 2 year old
Very attentive staff
Food was your average comfort food with a little Canadian/québécois spin on it
Will definitely come back when I'm back in Toronto"}
{"text":"This is a low key hangout with pool tables, a fire place and fish tank. C'est what? has shows from time to time and they can become very busy, but for the most part they are slower than most places in the area. 

They serve food until late so this is makes this place a even better place to end your night at."}
{"text":"Really nice food! Lamb burger is one of the best I've had. The service was good too and the food didn't take long. I'll definitely go back here again"}
{"text":"Why does it seem like all the servers here are dead inside?

0 stars if possible...booooooo!

I was treated as bad as Trump would treat a Mexican!"}
{"text":"This felt like a student pub. It's very much a beer and nachos type of pub. I'm not sure if there's anything noteworthy worth reporting. I wouldn't recommend you go out of your way to check this place out, but its not bad for a couple casual drinks."}
{"text":"What's with all the hype with this place? Its true they have a decent local beer selection, but its all bitters! I guess if your like me and not a big bitter beer fan, this isn't the place for you. Its also a bit of an older crowd, and out of my way."}
{"text":"I loved this place when we were in Toronto last spring! Their falafel is hands-down the best I've ever had! They also had a great craft beer selection."}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to review this place!

This is one of my top 3 picks for boutique beer in the city.  The environment is cosy and like the other places in the area the vibe can vary widely depending on what day of the week and what time you arrive.

My visits are seldom during the trendy/busy times.  Call me an old fart that way...  I just don't do trendy/hip.

The selection of micro-brews is extensive.  If it's small, new, or interesting (and local) they will have it on tap.  Flights are a must unless you're really in the mood for one type of beer the whole evening.

I haven't extensively eaten the menu here but the sweet potato fries are a definite stand-out.  They are pure warm, savoury, salty, herbed deliciousness.

The other food I've had has been good to great but not blow-your-mind like the sweet potato fries.

There are a couple pool tables and a reasonable-ish price for the usage.

The servers have always been excellent."}
{"text":"This review is based on a single stop at this location. It's a fairly cool basement location that was busy for a Sunday evening. Place has a decent collection of draft beer (thinking about 8-12 brands) but they wanted you to turn over a credit card before they would let you start a tab (great way to get your credit card stolen) which I objected to but caved to get the service I wanted. We ordered some food. It was 45 mins & we began to ask where the food was. We were told by the bartender that the \"chef had injured himself & had went to the hospital\" & no food would be available. He claims that he told everyone in the bar but somehow missed us even though we were sitting right in the middle of the restaurant!! This was crappy service so we paid a reduced bill & left without tipping! There are too many restaurants in T.O. to put up with crappy service!!"}
{"text":"I went to check this place out due the the beer selection hype. I have to admit that the selection was good, but I guess I imagined the length of the list would blow my mind; it did not. There were, however, quite a few interesting choices. 

The food was very tastey. They have cactus cut sweet potato fries! They do not say that they are cactus cut, but they are. The burges were excellent. Juicy and flavourful.

Our server was super nice. I even saw her very politely putting up with some guy who felt like telling her his life story instead of ordering.

But the best thing about this place, is the atmosphere. Very chill, very very chill. If there is a larger group of you, I recommend calling ahead and reserving the lounge area around the fireplace. Private-ish, with couches, and close to the bar.  :)"}
{"text":"Cosy British pub tucked away in the basement east of downtown. Lots of beer and food is average, however there are couches and a fireplace. Great place to hang out"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this pub twice during our 3 day trip to Toronto and it was a pleasure. The selection of craft beer was great, the staff was helpful and the vibe was comfortable. The entrance is sandwiched between 2 other eateries so you have to be really looking for it or you'll miss it. Give it a try, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection - one of the only places with cask beer in the city. Food is also good."}
{"text":"One the best places in Toronto for cask ales."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The beer list here is extensive and the staff is very friendly. Didn't try any food on this visit, but am going to go one more tome before I leave the city."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this past weekend with a friend that came into town and I enjoyed it. I've heard about C'est What doing a renovation and a change-up with their menu, but I can't really speak of that because it is not a part of my experience... On other occasions I have heard of the well-liked atmosphere that C'est What proclaims.

What is a part of my experience is this...

walking down stairs that evoked some sort of lost, yet always present history, where the ale is strong, the seats are packed and the ambiance is friendly with the kind of messy unkempt-ability you can appreciate... the former is a thought in my head, playing like a film screen. 

When my friend and I walked in it was bright and inviting, which is something I strongly respect in establishments- the way they were designed to make guests feel welcomed. Awesome. I also ended up running into an old friend, which admittedly, did feel good, it was the perfect place to have that happen...

So, back to my experience... The food: I was pleasantly surprised with what I ordered, the Mediterranean salad, which came packed full of veggies and a delicious complimentary dressing. In places I am not familiar in visiting, I have a fairly low expectation regarding the vegetarian options available.... Given previously poor experiences in restaurants, it is fair to say I am a skeptic. But C'est What, delivered on  all accounts. 

The brownie my friend and I split too, was guud! 

The only thing I wasn't completely ecstatic about was, upon walking into the washroom, I almost got hit with a wall that is right in front of you as you walk in... so for all those ladies out there that read this post before making an appearance at C'est What, watch it!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of the Victory Cafe, then I think you'd enjoy C'est What. It has a nice cozy atmosphere and the beer selection is fantastic as the beers are all microbrewed. The food can be pretty tasty, starting with the hazel nut brownie with ice cream. They make these fresh and they are a must try. The brownie is warm, and the ice cream is cold... just the way both should be. A perfect marriage. When it comes to food, the staggering pig sandwich is quite tasty and I would order it again. They also have some good specials sometime... like mac n cheese. I had some breaded mac n cheese balls there once as a special that I quite enjoyed.

Update: Have had issues with groups there. They wouldn't give us a table until we had four people arrive, which was cool. But we eventually had 11 people there, and we were running low on space. A large table freed up and we tried to take it. I said to the hostess, \"Can we switch tables to this one?\", and the hostess said \"NO.\", she then proceeded to sit four people there, instead of our eleven. The table could have sat 8 people with people on the ends, but we were stuck at a table that could fit 6 people with people on the ends. We then ran into issues later with her in the night as well trying to secure more space. And she just mouthed off to us that it was a Friday night. Blah blah blah. Which makes sense, but she already had shafted us on a larger table. Not sure I would suggest the place to a large group of friends again, and that's their loss. But the food is good. The drink selection is good. Just some of the service is TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"I went there years ago and was treated rudely by the owner/manager and made the mistake of going back now and well... some things have changed. What has changed? A new storefront, new fireplace and a redecoration, but you cannot judge a book by the cover. The service is bad, almost hostile. When the poutine arrives late and it is gooey cold you have to ask yourself did they make it in the mid-afternoon and serve it hours later or made it for us and let it sit on the counter for an hour and that's why the service was so slow. To boot, the room was half empty. The kicker and really what gets under my skin: the waiter's attitude. ATTITUDE. 
Same old same old.. too bad, a pub in the area, with a  fireplace and comfy seats would be huge, but C'est What is C'est Full of Ourselves and will not see me again."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place from other Yelp reviews and glad we did. Great atmosphere and live music. Food was really flavourful and fresh. We were here before the dinner crowd since we were going to a game so not packed but lots of tables reserved so I imagine busy place on a Saturday night. Great selection of beer and available in smaller sizes which I prefer so I can try many different kinds. Will come back for sure.  Oh and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"A cool joint in the basement of low rise at Church and Front Street. It's first and foremost a bar with the feel of being at a cozy lodge in the mountains somewhere. This is helped by the big fireplace that greets you as you walk into the main seating area. On this visit I had the poutine. It was your basic poutine (no added frills) and I think each component is worth discussing individually. Firstly the base, the fries - a thinner cut, no potato peel evident but felt real, and most importantly they had a nice crunch without being excessive. The cheese curds were in more of a dice than chunks, which is what I normally see. I actually liked this a lot because I could better control the cheese to fry ratio this way. Speaking of ratio, there was enough gravy to go around without rationing. The gravy was pretty good. Not runny or too thick with a solid flavour. A way better poutine than the novelty fast food-ish poutine chains out there."}
{"text":"I was there the other night for a girls night - first time after many years in the city, and after having heard of it on \"Night Life Listings\" as a teenager on TV.  

C'est What is a Toronto landmark for live music, home made brew and a fun party.

You walk down a large set of stairs to the reception desk.  Note that if you made reservations, you much have 90% of your group there before they will seat you.  I never realized how BIG this place is.  

It's HUGE.  I was surprised at how large it was actually.  There are 3 pool tables, 2 long bars, 2 fireplace seating areas and general seating, and that's just the back section, I didn't even look at the area behind the general reception check in.

We were a group of 5, and had called in advance, but some how they ended up not having a table for us in the \"restaurant\" section.  We ended up sitting at a long table in what was considered the bar area, yet only 5 feet away was considered table service.  I was displeased that in this area we had go to the bar and to do cash and carry for both drinks and food.  We could have run a tab on credit card, but would have still had to go to the bar for each beverage and food order.  That put a damper on the night and my experience.  It would be different if had only been there for drinks and a game of pool, but that was not the case.

The food we ordered was up and on our table extremely fast.  It was yummy and the price was reasonable, but nothing to write home about.  The beer, well they have so many to choose from it can be a bit dizzying.  C'est What also brews their own beers, but I did not try any.

In regards to the atmosphere, it's fun, chill and bright.  Aside from the pool tables, there are live bands and fun things to check out on the walls.

If you're in the area, it's a spot to check out, but don't make a special trip from out of town."}
{"text":"They have an amazing selection of beer and a slightly limited menu for food. 

I ordered my regular g&t - very very average, the amount and the drink itself is something I can easily get at bar244 for $3..not watered down but very medicore. 

Food was terrible...unbelievably disasterous. The nachos were dry and tasteless. It only came with the sour cream dip, not even salsa or guac???!?

And the calamari was a joke...

Our server disappeared for a good 30-40 min, then suddenly came back to check up on us every 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Since making my 1st ever visit to the venue in 2007 I think C'est What has become my most-often visited venue of all time.  This is due primarily to the fact that a social Group I helped run has had Events here since the Group first started about 10  1/2 years ago and the venue is pretty close to where I live.  I consider C'est What to be my favourite bar in Toronto.  Why, you might ask?

Read on to find out:

The venue used to be a wine cellar housed in a 100+ year old building; since C'est What first opened back in the late 1980's, there have been a multitude of different Events here.  My 1st visit here in 2007 was also the first time I attended a Beer Fest., which they host twice a year.  Called the Spring (or Fall) Festival of Craft Breweries, there's no admission fee, sampling stations set up at both bars in the venue and you pay $1 for a 3 to 5 ounce sample of beer (a small no. of beers at the Fest. cost 2 or 3 tickets - you buy tickets for all samples at the front entrance of the bar).  There's always about 48 (!) beers to choose from including cask selections, seasonal beers and one-offs, etc.  They also have other Events such as tap takeovers; live entertainment on certain nights and even their own radio station.

With over 40 taps specializing in Ontario Craft Beer, C'est What is a beer lover's paradise.  They also have a wide variety of often unique/eclectic food choices.  On the left/east side they have pool tables and dart boards and quite a bit of seating on both sides of the bar which is quite a large venue overall.  They even have a large fish bowl and a nice fireplace just inside the left entrance, where several friends and I sat and enjoyed beers and food at my last visit there just yesterday.

I've found the service to be fairly good there over the years; they allow you to sample the beers if you're not sure what you want to order and/or want to sample something new or something you haven't had before.  Yesterday a friend and I split their Tostidos which were quite flavourful; on previous visits I've had or shared their veggie burger, calamari, nachos or fries.  A long time ago I had brunch there on several occasions with another social Group.

With low ceilings, somewhat upscale and unique décor and an obviously distinct layout, the ambiance of C'est What is like no other venue I've been to.  It can get crowded on certain nights with correspondingly slow(er) service at times.  The prices for food and beverages are somewhat high but you have to take into account the fact that the venue is located in the downtown core.  Conveniently located close to several subway stations, not to mention St. Lawrence Market and the Financial District, C'est What is a great destination for regulars, tourists and occasional visitors alike."}
{"text":"Friend has been telling me to check this place out.  I finally had the chance to go to TDot and go.   Amazing!  Everything was great.  I love the location, decor, atmosphere, food, and service.   

Our server was very fast and responsive.   Made some great recommendations.  

I now know that the roti is more then enough for two people.  So next time it's one roti for my GF and I.  I will be going back next time I go out to Toronto."}
{"text":"Trolling my yelp feed as I drink out of my C'est What? Glass....
Got to say, for longevity, atmosphere, and consistent music,beer, food, vibe atmosphere  a10 hands down.  Part of the T.O. Legacy.  Great  craft beer for 25!+ years and lamb burger, pouting, are wins sll around!

  A gem from a wistful Expat- don't take it for granted eh!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at C'est What? on Front Street E.

Black Oak Brewing Co. had a tap take-over ... Ken, the owner of Black Oak, bought Gord a beer for his birthday

When I got there about 5pm, it was fairly quiet.  When we left a couple hours later, it was fairly busy.

Gord ordered the Beef Stroganoff special.  He said it was really good.  In fact, he asked for a spoon so he could get the last of the sauce.

I ordered Dijon Chicken and it was really good.  I'd get it again.

Nikki was our server and she took good care of us."}
{"text":"I really like this place.

It's quiet, intimate and you can actually have a good conversation over a pint. The food is above average pub fare and they make one hell of a Gin and Tonic. 

Price could be lower but the price is worth it for the intimate setting."}
{"text":"I love C'est What for so many reasons.

I first came here for a Craft Brew festival a few years ago, and was amazed by the fun and cozy interior.  I immediately thought to myself that this was one of those places that make me happy to have moved to Toronto.  Unpretentious, hip and cozy are words I'd use to describe this place.

I've since come back a number of times, each being equally as enjoyable as the first time.  Their beer selection is second to none, especially if you're looking for something local and delicious.  With a rotating menu of beers on tap, there's always something new to try, and I've always found the bartenders friendly and knowledgeable about their current selections.

If beer isn't your thing, this place has a great food menu as well.  My personal favourite is their lamb burger which comes with these amazing thinly sliced sweet potato fries and tzatziki that never disappointed.  

Finally, if you're looking for something a little more, there is a small selection of board games around their fire place as well as a few pool tables.

I constantly remark about C'est What being my favourite spot in town, and every time I go back I'm reminded as to why."}
{"text":"C'est What? C'est okay. 

I'm a sucker for basement bars, craft beers, and franglish puns -- so this spot had my name all over it. We stopped in for an early dinner on a weeknight when it was just starting to fill up.

The atmosphere is pretty good for a casual dinner or drinks with friends, and the service was fast and friendly. The beer list is exclusively Canadian and they make several of their own in house. We tried a sampling of their housemade beers and a few others -- Big Butt Smoked Dark Ale, Coffee Porter, Steve's Dreaded Chocolate Orange, the Eephus Oatmeal Brown Ale, Headstock IPA, and the cask. 

The Coffee Porter and Chocolate Orange were among the best, but it would have been hard for either of us to have more than one. The other selections were all pretty good, but we're big IPA and dry ale drinkers (read: love hops) and none of them packed much of a punch. I'd try them again on a long night out, but for just a drink or two I like my beers strong and meaty.  

The food was slightly better, and there are still a few items on the menu I'd like to check out on our next visit. We ended up ordering the Moroccan Stew and the Jambalaya, and both filled our need for comfort food on a cold night. We saw from other tables that the portions were pretty big, so we didn't end up ordering any of the appetizers or sides. It turned out to be a good decision because we both found the walk up those stairs to be more than a little daunting after we'd finished our meal.

All in all, it was a cool little spot to hang out for a few beers and fill up on rice. We'll be back to check out more of their selections and hopefully find a few rotating seasonal beers that might be more our fancy. 

Jusque là!"}
{"text":"By myself. Asked for a non hoppy beer and the guy poored me the lightest beer ever. Did not tell me what it was, ask if I wanted a taste or even check back.  Too bad cuz it looks to be a nice fun place with pool tables and great music playing. Off to someplace else"}
{"text":"Huge (really!) selection of beers - I've found lots of \"local\" breweries products which I barely heard about. European beers are also present, and it's actually nice to compare the flavours.

Food is good - something between 3.5 and 4 stars, depending on a plate. A bit more diverse than a typical beer-side selection, so you can actually eat there, not only drink.

There is live music, and it's not annoying if you are not in the mood, or may be even quite enjoyable if you are.

Servers are friendly, but somehow distracted - you may need to make an effort to be blessed by their attention. There was one (hopefully unique) case when a waiter brought me my order almost half an hour before serving the rest of our group. Result - my plate was cold, their plates were late.

Overall feeling: nice place. Not without its quirks, but definitely worth returning."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks before a concert. We sat at the bar (we're bar flies, we can't help it) and had a few different pints and ate the tandoori chicken sandwich and the goat roti. Both dishes had a really good amount of meat (not a ton of filler). 

The bartender was friendly and gave us samples of a couple different beers as we were undecided on what to drink (not to mention they have some beers that are made in house that we've never heard of before). 

We got the apple pie for desert, which was also amazing. We barely came up to breathe haha. 

I would recommend C'est What to anyone who enjoys beer and comfort food."}
{"text":"There are over 50 C'est What reviews so I will regale you with stories of good times I have had here rather than rehash the good the bad and the ugly.  (the good is the drinks, the meh is the food and the ugly are the prices to play pool!)

The first time I went to C'est What was with Leslie S. on a random Friday night two years ago.  We played pool, met a group of guys in town for a bachelor party, got our bar tab cut off (I don't remember us drinking 12 pints!) and stumbled home with a stop for cinnabonn at Union Station where Leslie wouldn't let me eat mine because she was done hers already.  I will never forget you not letting me eat that pastry you know!

The second time I went to C'est What was with Leslie and Robin F from Vancouver, who was crashing with me for a week or two when I still worked at a consulting firm.  We arrived for dinner because they are both vegetarians and we all like to drink.  The food here is not good.  It's verging on bad.  But they have 30 taps so... whatever.  That night there was a dixieland band playing in the other room and we did not wear out our welcome, thankfully.

I didn't go to C'est What again until this year on my birthday, when Mike S. took me to a bourbon tasting hosted by Makers Mark's Ron Oliver.  Yes, his name is really Ron Oliver & he is a swell guy.  Mike and I had a blast and the food was actually really great that night (or we ate after we had been there for awhile... you decide). 

Finally, another Mike S evening at C'est what was the Craft Beer Festival.  Wow, was this an awesome night.  1$ tickets for a 3oz sample of more than 55 beers.  We had a great time.  This was an all around great night and I attribute it to C'est What starting things off right.  I arrived at 1700 and secured us a table that we stayed at until 2130, sampling over 15 beers from the list.  Then we went to starbucks because it was only 930.  I spilled coffee on my shirt but I didn't notice, and we went to 3 other venues while I looked like a dirty vagrant.  GREAT NIGHT.

C'est What: a place where I always have a good time, no matter what."}
{"text":"C'est What is an OK place for some nice craft beers and perhaps light snacks. Although I do enjoy their large craft beer selection that changes often, I do find their prices a bit on the high side if you decide to do beer flights instead of by the pint...it adds up very quickly! On the other hand, you are in St Lawrence market area which is very touristy, and so the prices here reflect that."}
{"text":"My boyfriend being who he is, we always have to visit at least one brew pub and/or brewery on every trip we take. We were looking for a place to have dinner before The Who concert and didn't want to stray too far from the AC Centre, so the boy picked out this place. 

It was SUPER full when we got there (this was around 6pm on a Friday, so we expected it). We were told it would be at least a 30 minute wait for a table, which wasn't too bad with us, so we went to the bar to wait for them to page us. Luckily we grabbed the last two stools so didn't have to stand. Well, we ended up spending our entire dinner at the bar! Once we were there for a bit and realized a) it was going to be a longer wait for a table than we thought and b) we could order from the menu from the bartender, we said 'screw it' to a table and just enjoyed dinner from our barstools. I was impressed that we had that option and the service was quite prompt, although it was probably their busiest night the whole week (AND the night of a huge concert).

They have a lot of great beer choices here - mostly Ontario craft brews, which definitely gets a 'shop local' thumbs-up from me. I had a lemony beer (can't remember the name of it) that was quite tasty, and the boy tried several. Some of their brews have really funny names, like Big Butt Smoked Dark Ale and Dead  Elephant Ale. They even have a beer brewed with hemp. 

Their food menu has a neat mix too - basically your usual pub fare but with funky latin american and middle eastern twists - such as my choice, \"The Staggering Pig\", which is a sandwich of \"chipotle pulled-pork shoulder tossed in our Coffee Porter barbecue sauce on a toasted ciabatta bun garnished with honey-vinaigrette coleslaw.\" It was a HUGE sandwich, but really tasty. I loved all the flavour. I like that they use their beer in a lot of their sauces and dressings and their \"frites\" were really tasty.

I liked the atmosphere - it was very full, as I said, but I wasn't really bothered by the noise and crowd. The room with the bar we sat in (on the left of the main entrance) was very cozy  with the wood-paneled walls, fireplace and pool tables. The chatter and bustle gave the room a nice 'buzz' of activity that revved us up for boogying to Pete Townshend and co. 

All and all, a cool and well-run downtown pub."}
{"text":"Spacious, great beer options, and a lot of restaurants in the area to choose from if you only want to come here for drinks. In fact, I have only ever ordered beer here. The only annoying part is that it is in a basement and every single time I visit them I lose internet connection. But then WIND is shit, so I can't really blame the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here last night for a beer with some friends after going to the movies across the street. 

I was super excited that they had St. Ambroise Pumpkin Ale as it is my new found favourite autumnal beverage! For this reason alone I would give this establishment 5 stars, but it actually has several other fine features that warrant the high rating. 

I actually didn't have a chance to try any of the food (though, I plan to on my next visit), but judging by what I saw other people eating it looked pretty darn decent (yes, I realize that's a lame food review...I'll update this when I have actually consumed something from this bar. Promise!). 

The trickiest component to a successful bar is the ambiance. It's the je nais se quois that, unlike a fine ale, can't be bottled and bought. A place either has it or it doesn't. Cest What? has achieved this laid back and seemingly effortless comfortable feeling that is perfect for catching up with friends over a couple beers."}
{"text":"It doesn't seem to matter what night of the week it is, C'est What is pretty much always busy. Okay, so it gets super busy on weekends, but weeknights is when I prefer to hit up this spacious basement bar anyway. The beer selection is excitingly varied with something to make everyone happy.

My favourite seats are the big comfy blue couches that surround the toasty fireplace. With a nice frothy pint in your hand, your feet up in front of the fire, and your head slowly sliding down the back of the squishy couch, you just might forget that you're not actually hanging out at that French chalet after a long day on the slopes."}
{"text":"Great beer selection - especially of local Ontario craft beers.  Decent - but not extraordinary - pub-style food.

Don't order the yam fries though - they came limp and soggy, and they were shaped like chips, not fries.  The flavour was fine, but chips should be crisp, not a limp soggy mess."}
{"text":"I love a place with a good beer list! 

C'est What? definitely meets with my beer list approval. They have a large beer menu with pages of what's on tap and in bottles. There's quite a large selection - they have probably the largest craft beer list I've seen.

The menu is pub inspired, but also has a few more unique options - I had the chicken roti, which was great for dinner and for lunch the next day (paired with my Mexican stand off appetizer, which I split, it was way too much food!). They also have a large selection of vegetarian options, so a perfect place to go with your veggie friends. 

The decor / vibe is casual / pubby, which is perfect fit for their beer list and menu. 

The service is okay, nothing special. I find the servers can sometimes be a little short and have an \"I know best attitude\" (I'm not saying you don't, just be nice about it!) however for a casual place, amazing service is not usually my expectation - it would be nice though! 

Definitely a great place to check out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"First went here for a work party.  I like the atmosphere and really enjoy the tap beers - great selection.  The atmosphere is really friendly and enjoyable with a number of unique feeling seating areas.  I always try to visit while in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant with a group of friends to celebrate. We went to the restaurant days before to find out if they have a plating fee because we wanted to bring a cake. The hostess gave me a card and told me to email the manager. We emailed the manager and a fee was never mentioned. When we arrived with our cake, we were informed that there was a plating fee. At that point, it was to late to find another place. I was the only one who liked my food and one of my friend's food was burnt and had to be sent back. The waiter acted like he didn't like his job and we inconveniencing him with our presence. Don't recommend"}
{"text":"Ate here while in town for work.  For starters, I don't think the microbrew scene has hit in Canada like it has in the US, or at least it does not seem that way.  I was hunting for a microbrew carrying  pub for dinner, and I had to hunt to find this location.  In the end, it was worth it, as the food was quite good, the beer selection was interesting and the service was excellent.  I sat at one of the bars as I was dining alone, and the servers were just the right mix of leave you alone and attentive.  I would return if in the area."}
{"text":"C'est What is known for their micro brew beers with many different styles available everyday. Great variety of beers.

Unfortunately, their beers are o.k., just o.k. and most likely will leave you asking what they were thinking or 'C'est What' referring to what you are drinking.  I've been to many micro brew houses all over North America, and C'est What really needs to pick up its game.  There are far too many good bars that brew their own, maybe they are lucky they are not close to any really good brew pubs.

They do make it up with their food though, I suppose that is their saving grace.

C'est What? Meh. C'est o.k."}
{"text":"My first time here in 10 years and I am giving it 1 star based on my experience I had here on Sunday June 13th at lunchtime. We saw the sign that said 'wait to be seated', and surprise, surprise nobody came over to greet us or help us to a table. After sitting down for about 5 minutes,  the lone waiter  who was working walked by us twice but did not offer us any menus, or didn't even look at us. Its not like the place was busy (about half full) Finally I approached a waiter, and he said he was very busy and would get back to us. We waited another 10 minutes and finally gave up. Say what? no service here, so I couldn't even review the food or the drinks. If their management is reading this, you seriously need to either improve the service or hire more servers, and thanks for wasting 20 minutes of my time for nothing on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Your failure even acknowledge 3 guests was unbelievable. Seriously, how do you stay in business?"}
{"text":"A favourite for food and drink 
The Bison Burger, The Apple Pie a la mode, and good daily specials. 
They brew their own beers as well as have a good selection of Ontario microbrewery beers."}
{"text":"C'est What has a great tap list. You can't deny that. The service is where the issue was. We went during the week on an afternoon and it wasn't packed but there were other people there. We sat at the bar and it took quite some time to get help. The staff seemed nice enough and it's not like they're behind the bar hanging out, but, for some reason, it seemed like a lot to make drinks, take orders, and check in on folks. Oh, yes, there's a full bar so if you're not in the mood for a beer you can get a cocktail.
 
There's not much ambiance and there aren't any tvs or music playing so it's kinda stale. But, a great place to have a beer or 2."}
{"text":"The beer selection at C'est What is truly one of the best in the city which is why we came in on Sat. night.

Be aware that if you are in a group of 6 people or more, they will not do separate tabs for the table and there is an instant 15% gratuity tacked onto your bill.

Our server was cold, indifferent and wasn't really willing to answer questions about the beer menu.  He gave me an eye rolling when I asked for water in addition to my pint order.

Pint prices range from $6-$8. I got the Hop City Mr. Huff lager, and also sampled someone's Spearhead Pineapple IPA which I thought I would like since I love pineapple but it was just too bitter for me.  

We ordered 4 appetizers - poutine with bacon ($9), calamari ($9.95), artichoke dip ($7.95) and antojitos ($6.95) and they came out pretty quickly.

I think this was the first time I had been to C'est What in the evening and the atmosphere was pretty loud and rowdy with lots of action going on near the pool table areas.  

Might have been an off night for service because I have been here before and the service was much better."}
{"text":"Great vibe, food and service. Don't expect amazing but a very solid option all-round."}
{"text":"Had my first date with my fiance here, a couple of follow up dates as a newly engaged couple, a few girls' nights, a couple of friends' nights and I still haven't reviewed it! It's such a good haunt for beer lovers and now that the food has improved it's a regular haunt!

The service can be a hit or a miss, I find that to be the only downside. Eight out of ten times we get a really good server so it's not that bad. I really love their beer list, there's something for everyone. They have wine and whisky too, so don't worry.

The food has gotten infinitely better! I've had the calamari, poutine, pulled pork sandwich, falafel, club wrap, shepherd's pie, jambalaya, the lamburger and a few specials. My favourites are the poutine, club wrap and pulled pork items. Most of the dishes are quite large. The brownie is delicious and though it's not on the menu they're happy to get you a scoop of ice cream by itself :D

Just a heads up, they don't take reservations for dinner unless you have a big group (more than 6) and they do add a gratuity on your bill if you're in group of 6+."}
{"text":"Ok, so to change my story. C'est what did issue the refund on my credit card, so I offer them more credibility now. Transaction date was the same as my initial transaction, but for some reason CIBC had a 5 day delay in the posted date.  I have since then cancelled my dispute resolution. 

Given the morality of the issue, and the manager keeping to his word. I give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"I would give this a place two point five stars if I could because I actually like the environment and beer selection quite a bit, but the service has always been SO terribly awful, I just can't bare to up the junction to three stars.

Every time I've been (which is kind of a lot), the servers don't go near you unless you're basically screaming your body off. Most of them have no sense of humour, so my flirting and ridiculousness gives me no upper hand. They show no personality and act like they hate their jobs. Maybe they do? Maybe that's part of the job? Maybe you have to be surly to work there?

Worst experience ever this weekend, though. Went to the bar with some friends to order more drinks. Friend asked for a cocktail suggestion -- something delicious, but that still tastes like alcohol -- and the bartender refused to give any input or reccos. I was like, \"Really? You won't give any suggestions?\" and he said, \"I don't read minds.\" 

Another friend asked for a B&B and instead of saying, \"Sorry, we don't have that,\" he just said, \"No.\" Then he slammed my friend's beer down in front of him and half of it spilled all over the bar in front of him.

Later, he came around to pick up some of our glasses and I helped push them over to his side of the table -- you know, just to be nice and give him a hand. He looked at me and said in the meanest, most sarcastic voice I've ever heard, \"Thanks for doing my entire job for me. I really appreciate that.\"

Man! I am riled up about this still! I can be head-over-heels for a place, but the moment someone is a jackass, I can't deal.

But whatever, beers are delicious. Haven't had the food, but have been around lots of groups eating there and it doesn't look too impressive. Hah."}
{"text":"C'est what is the safest choice in the esplanade area. The venue is large enough to accommodate patrons without the need for a lineup which is a big advantage over the likes of biermarkt and Pravda across the street. 
Additionally, cest what boasts one of the most impressive beer lists in the city and pairs some pretty decent food with it too.
The sweet potato chips that are often mentioned on yelp really are some of the best in the city. 

The pool tables are available on a running hour basis. The bar also has the advantage of offering different niches, from a cozy couch area to one with pool tables and another facing a stage. 
C'est what also serves as a rotating exhibit for local artists (including yelp's own Neil T) and this is definitely something to appreciate in a local bar.

Overall consistent service, a cozy atmosphere matched with a fantastic beer list make C'est What? one of the best spots you can rely on downtown."}
{"text":"Before going into C'est What I had the expectation that this would be a place for drinks only. I didn't expect much in terms of decor and food. I came out of there completely wrong. Although this place is downstairs, it has this feeling of being in a bar basement in your house. Cozy, clean and modestly decorated bar area made of oak to give off a classy look without any gawdy beer posters strewn about. On top of that, their menu features some very interesting dishes pushing organic and local flavours.

My wife had the appetizer calamari and I had a plate of chicken fingers with their herbed fries. Both get a check mark for deliciousness. We would definitely have to come back to try the other items on the menu.

Their 35 taps of beer didn't disappoint. Moderately priced at $6-$7 per pint you really get some variety. With there being 4 in our party we got to cover a spectrum of beers. From the Caraway Rye (which didn't taste like it), to the 10 Bitter Years, the Big Butt which tasted like I was licking the inside of a chimney wall (very smoky tasting), to the winter ale which had enough of a hint of cinnamon to remind you that Christmas was coming and it was getting cold outside.

The service at this place was impeccable. The waiter serving us had such a nonchalantness about him it made the experience even better. The guy only came around when he saw our table was in need of more items. His service time was also extremely prompt. You ordered a beer and he didn't go to 5 other tables before going to fill your order. It seemed like 30 seconds after ordering the pint had arrived. The food service was also super quick.

When you mix a plethora of beer taps and an extensive unique menu you get 5 stars in my books."}
{"text":"This little bar offers live music but little else. The band on Friday night was in sync and the perfect balance but the service was blah. The interior resembles someones rec room and when asking for a suggestion on what to drink creates an eye roll the desire to return is gone. With so many venues for live music in Toronto I would skip pat this one again. The 2 stars were for the band. They were very good."}
{"text":"The hostess was a rude, the service/seating sucked, some of the people I was with felt discriminated against  and the food wasn't the best. I've been there several times before and everything was fine and the food was great.. I think it's safe to say I'm done going back to this place..."}
{"text":"Great beer and really good food. Done. Review over. Go try this place :)

Yes, I really liked C'est What. They have two different types of October Fest cask ales on draft; and they're local... come on now. Just great and the staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"My only previous experience at this place was memorable for
1. the apple pie
2. this guy with whom I did not get along (rather, he with I)
3. the walk home-- at least an hour from the bowels of the city (Front Street) to...the...larynx of the city (College St)? This walk marked the last time I wore Converse All-Stars as legitimate footwear and switched to New Balance (I couldn't walk for days after).

It is now the place where the internet and real-life famously(?) and delightfully collided. I also had loads of delicious St. Ambroise Apricot beer (which I've never had on tap before), and ate far more poutine than I ever thought I would (I guess I can't really keep claiming not to like it, huh?), possibly due to the generous garnish of green onions.

The atmosphere is really nice, cozy and yes, \"mature\". Enjoy many beers, upscale pub fare and a really (as Connie said) great place to sit and gather with many others. Try and sit in front of the fireplace if you can- don't worry, there's a screen in front of it to protect you and your belongings. 

p.s. apple pie."}
{"text":"The beers you'll find here are unique, don't expect to see the regular mainstream offerings. If you don't like beer, or cider at least, you won't find much else to drink. Had the sweet potato chips on the side, which were alright. Definitely prefer it in fry-form but they didn't have that. On a food and drink level, this place is alright. You'll love it if you're an avid beer drinker though. 

The atmosphere is definitely something to come back for. It's really chill and unpretentious - something that's hard to come by in the downtown core (that's not to say it caters to the college crowd because rest assured it definitely doesn't)."}
{"text":"C'est What is A-OK if you want to beer and talk nonsense with your friends.

Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious.. but definitely don't bring your date here, she/he would think that \"oh we are just friends, nothing more...\" 

Good draft selections and friendly bartender... even let you have a taste before serving you something that he thinks that you might not like.. I definitely would not have enjoy Big Butt Smoked Dark ale.....or any big butts!

All the drafts comes in half pint, great if you are doing a bar crawl which in my case..or you can early a couple of other beers and do it like a beer tasting."}
{"text":"After all the hype from other beer lovers, I was really expecting more. 

They have a good beer list, we all know that. However, their in house brews are nothing outstanding, or even really worth trying. Everything else is in stock at any decent LCBO. The staff was fine, the music on the night we went was pretty terrible, we actually wanted to move farther back to continue talking. The food was awful. Plus, it's not even a decently priced place.

I really wanted to love this place, but I doubt I'll ever return, unless there's a specific event that seems worthwhile.
 
I had: (why, yes, I do like dark beers, thank you for noticing!)
Big butt smoked dark ale (x2, it was my favourite, but still rather unnoteworthy)
joan's dark secret (meh)
steve's dreaded chocolate (worst chocolate beer I've tried.)
moroccan brown ale (meh)
darkside (meh)
terrestrial brown ale - march feature (pretty good, wellington's is never awful)

Yeah, I was pretty drunk!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday afternoon after walking about... 6 miles. Grabbed a couple of beers, poutine, and a lamb burger. 
Was ok. Not outstanding. We didn't leave any food behind, if that's what you're asking. But I don't know that I'd go back to a place that boasts such a great beer selection and doesn't deliver (at least in my snobby san diego craft beer mind)."}
{"text":"I love this place a lot! It was one of my College hangouts and it was the first place I had a beer when I turned 19. The owner is really friendly and they do a great job at selecting the best beers on the market."}
{"text":"My group had 6 people in it, and the women at the front told us that we would have to wait after 3 other groups, and they would not send a text or call when a table was ready. She told us to stick around when clearly everywhere to sit was taken. She said to sit at the bar if anything. 
Thing is, we checked by the area with the pool table and there were these tables free with stools. Only after one of us asked, she told us we could sit there and place our orders at the bar. Why did she not just tell us this in the first place?!?!?!
I had gotten the shepherds pie which was delicious. Bigger portion than I thought. And I also tried the beer with apricot notes, honestly not that awesome.
The sweet potatoes chips are addictive, but you have to ask for the sauce. Overall get food, sucky front desk lady."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 - regular bar food

Beer: 5/5 - nice choice of many

Service: 4/5 - nice helpful people

Price: 4/5 

Location: 5/5 - right in the centre

Will be Back!"}
{"text":"Came here ten years ago and I'm still annoyed enough to leave a review now. Have never had a more condescending, rude, and frustrating server in my life. As I type this review my wife is telling me I carry a grudge too long. Maybe so, but you made a mortal enemy that night a decade ago C'est what."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the city. Amazing beer selection, and a really helpful staff. They have casks, kegs, bottles, cans, as well as their own beers. The beers rotate on a pretty regular basis which is great. They have some beers that seem to be permanent on the menu like their house beers, along with a handful of other local brews, but you can always go in there and get something you've not tried before.

 You can get any beer in a full, half, or quarter pint which allows you to try as many beers as you'd like and live to tell the tale. They also really focus on getting up and coming breweries that you might not being to find at other pubs which is really fantastic in my opinion. Love going in here to try a bunch of new beers, chat with the staff, and get a hearty meal out of the deal.

Food is also great. I've had the chickpea burger, and shepherd's pie and both were fantastic! I recommend this place to anybody who enjoys food, beer, or both. They also have billiards tables in the back which is great if you like to shoot pool. I've gone here when I've have a couple hours to kill and wanted to try a few new beers and it is such a welcoming environment."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection. Food is pretty good pub fare."}
{"text":"You have to like a place that is dedicated to serving local brews. Fantastic local beer selection (and also a great wine selection, if that is more your style). I had the buffalo burger and it was great. I've been to a number of places that get buffalo burgers wrong and make it either too dry to flavourless, but C'Est What gets this one right. I had to have the beer float for dessert. The service is great too, the staff are very enthusiastic about their jobs."}
{"text":"This place is a Toronto classic.  Very cozy cottage-like surroundings with live music and a super  beer selection.  Great in the wintertime.  Staff are very accommodating.  The only thing that is less appealing is that it is in a basement!"}
{"text":"It's pretty cool, the ambience is pretty great and it's a fairly large space with multiple pool tables and an array of beers, lagers and other drinks to choose from but the food is alright. I order the butter chicken and it was ok I was a bit disappointed and the naan I'm pretty sure was pita bread. 
Apart from that it's a pretty cool place."}
{"text":"My brother and I love going to C'est What for the yam frites with sour cream and the great quesadillas. I've celebrated a few birthdays there as well and the experience was terrific!

Also, they have a fine selection of beer that never fails to impress the beer lovers among my group of friends!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this establishment once I bit into their succulent lamb burger paired nicely with sweet potato chips. This was rather surprisingly as they make their chips in house. The flavour combinations were out of this world and I really enjoyed the atmosphere with a live band playing the background. This is definitely a hidden gem in the St Lawrence market area!"}
{"text":"I came here with not much of an expectation, I don't know if it was their terrible website layout, actually yes, I blame their terrible website layout (I am being serious). 

The entrance was a skipper, you don't expect it to be where it is. You enter and you go subterranean and that is when all of your judgments of the website go out the window (pun intended, when is it not?). 

Service

Friendly people, as the name of the song goes around here. They know how to keep their customers happy with....

The Drink

Waupoos Cider: The best Canadian cider and one of the best in general that I've had.. A 6.5 with a light semi-sweet taste gave it content and smoothness.

The Meal
Butter Chicken Poutine: Butter chicken on top of fries? There hasn't been a day that I haven't thought about this plate. 5/5

I loved C'est What, all they had to do was let me try a drink and one dish to win me over. The location although not so welcoming from the outside turns out to be a very relaxed spot where you can come and unwind. Fix that website though."}
{"text":"What a unique play on words for the restaurant's name! We had our last meal here before leaving Toronto. Couldn't find much restaurants around that served poutine other than Smoke's Poutinerie. Trusty ol' Yelp led me to here. The bf and I each had poutine. I had the Classic poutine and the bf had the Pulled Pork poutine. They are decent sized, good for one person OR for two not-so-hungry people. You decipher which one is you lol. We were pretty hungry and we both gobbled our dishes quite fast. Both of them tasted delicious! We'd have to say it tasted better than Smoke's Poutinerie too. The Pulled Pork tasted a bit better than the Classic one in my opinion. We both washed it down with some beer. For a Sunday afternoon the place was a bit empty. The servers lagged a little when we needed their attention (ordering, getting the check, etc) but we let it slide cause the poutine here was delicious!"}
{"text":"First night ever in Toronto, and we decide to go here. Great beers and burgers! Don't expect fast service, so just relax with a beer and chill out with your friends."}
{"text":"Beer selection is consistently great. Food is consistently mediocre. Service is consistently inconsistent.

It's a great place for a beer with a friend, a less great place to plant a group for the night.

Beer is a little pricey, even for the area. Servers can be counted on to recommend beers, can't be counted on to recommend any other drinks, nor are they consistently friendly or patient. 

LIghter fare is lacking, vegetarians will be generally out of luck, and the standard pub grub is run-of-the-mill.

I live close, and find myself here every couple months. I love the beer selection and the atmosphere - I wish the service and the food made me want to come more often."}
{"text":"Cool basement hideaway serving up an extensive array of local brews.  It was one of the first and last places we hung out at during our Toronto trip and I'd head back there tonight if I could.  On both occasions the staff was friendly and willing to point you toward a good beer.  While the cavernous basement location isn't exactly warm and cozy, I felt quite comfortable bellying up to the bar and getting intimate with some pints of Canadian beer.  It should be noted though, that the lighting is rather perfect in here -- not too dark and nowhere near bright.

Oh and the food was very much on the higher end of the pub-food scale.  Delicious all around."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection... I'm such fan of places that do half-pints so I can have a variety of different beers. Plus the menu looked scrumptious. A good friend of mine was raving about the poutine here. Which is what prompted my bestie and I hitting this place when she visited. The poutine was on point... as was my club wrap. All the beers were delicious. This place is worth the trek from the West End and I will be back. BEEEEEERRRRR!"}
{"text":"c'est whatttttt? 
came here on a day off to have lunch with my friend was very left pretty impressed, not mind blowing, but better then normal for sure. 
had the calamari to start which was fantastic, lamb burger and butter chicken. the friend that I went with had my sides for the lamb burger which was fine by me. I was really excited to have the butter chicken, until it hit the table...sliced almonds? ugh, I wish I would have read the menu/ew/my bad, im not a fan of nuts and almonds have no place with butter chicken. the lambburger was amazing, would have preferred it outside of the naan bread, but still delicious none the less. 
the service is great, quick and efficient. a different kind of problem I have with this place is with it being in the basement of a building and lack of light/natural light, not a fan. 
parking options are on the street and various parking lots in the neighborhood. 
transit options are the 75 and 121 bus, and the 504/514 streetcars with a bit of a walk. 
definitely worth checking out if you are in the area
the website needs a bit of an update...just my two cents on that as well."}
{"text":"Met a large group here for a Thursday happy hour and was impressed with the amount of space - there was plenty of room for us to mingle and chat without being overly crowded or having to yell at each other. The bartenders were attentive and got our drinks quickly. Unfortunately, I can't speak to the many beers they have on tap, but everyone in our group seemed pleased with their selections. We only ordered fries to nibble on, and while they were just OK, the jalapeno mayo that they came with was delicious!!"}
{"text":"We went to C'est What for lunch with my coworkers. A group of 9 people. They didn't take reservations, this is why I am giving them 4 and not 5 stars. I had the Huggie Bear, a delicious boozy hot chocolate drink, the Morrocan stew and the brownies. The food was tasty and the portions are healthy. I will definitely be back to try something else."}
{"text":"Discovered this place a little while ago and this place was a wonderful find!

The atmosphere is very pub style, with dimmed lighting and such. I got the chicken tenders entrée. It came with an interesting mayo based sauce. I forget what it was though. The fries I loved. Probably some of the best I've had. My friends didn't liked them because they said they were a bit on the greasy side.

Their beer menu is extensive, I love the variety.

Highly recommended and will dine here again."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick drink and really enjoyed the extensive drinks menu. My pear cider was pretty good too, but the server wasn't super awesome and a little condescending when my friend asked him for specials or recommendations."}
