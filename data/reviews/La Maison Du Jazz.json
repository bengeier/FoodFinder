{"text":"My husband and I made a reservation to have drinks here on Valentine's Day. I called too close to the date to make dinner reservations, so we were planning on just coming in and enjoying two seats at the bar. However, when we arrived, we were told that we could sit in the dining room near the stage if we were wiling to order anything (in terms of food) off the menu. I was psyched about the performer (a Sinatra-like \"crooner\") and of course we accepted. We had already had dinner, so we just ordered a piece of chocolate cake to split and a bottle of wine. The cake was delicious (albeit a little expensive for cake) and we really enjoyed our wine. The performance was so fun to watch. The band was great and the singer was a wonderful performer. The perfect choice for Valentine's Day! Now onto the atmosphere. I love this place for its decorations. I'm all about sparkles and beautiful things and The House of Jazz certainly doesn't disappoint. The walls in the dining room are lined with signed photos of singers and album covers of the venue's performers. The lighting is perfect with romantic candle light and gorgeous chandeliers hanging everywhere. The staff was patient and polite, despite the huge crowd and busy night. We had so much fun! The place is a little expensive, though, so we'll probably save it for special occasions."}
{"text":"We are here visiting for the first time. We have ordered beer, ribs, chicken, Mac and cheese. Beer is a good start. The band is taking a break. Will continue later.."}
{"text":"Came here for the jazz, not the food.  There was a $10 cover on a Monday night, but since we wanted entertainment on our vacation we were OK with that.  The band was great and we thoroughly enjoyed our night out.  The food wasn't great.  We did not order their 'specialties' and instead had potato skins, a salad, and caramel explosion dessert.  The potato skins were cheesy, but not great and the salad was a simple salad.  Dessert was good though with a fun presentation.  Come here for the jazz, not the food."}
{"text":"The House of Jazz in Montreal has a sophisticated atmosphere that feels like a classic movie. We had fantastic seats for dinner around 8:30 and stayed straight through to the second act that started after 10:00. The entertainment was spectacular. A few technical notes to consider if you go: parking is available on the street, and was a much better option than the pay lots (which were having cars towed after the lots closed early on Saturday, around 9:00PM!). The Maison du Jazz charges $5/person cover regardless of where you sit or if you have dinner. They also charged $2/person coat-check (which is not optional). Reservations are only available before 8:30, so we were fortunate to walk-in and still get a table; afterwards the wait was over an hour at best, and I did not see a table open up until we left at 11:00PM. If you do manage a seat, plan to linger and have a few rounds to celebrate your coveted spot. Dinner options were basically limited to steak or barbecue chicken. My strip steak was cooked well beyond the medium-rare that I requested, but was otherwise ok. Cocktails were made to spec and cost around $9 a pop (a bottle of wine would be much more economical, perhaps a nice Cava from Spain). If you time it just right, a trip to this Jazz club could be one of the most memorable moments of a visit to Montreal; if you're just a bit late you may spend a miserable night on the cold street. Oh and one last thing: dress well, look cool. Most men wore blazers and the ladies had cocktail dresses."}
{"text":"We went there on a Travelzoo coupon. At that price i would give it 4 stars but since that was technically half price I feel compelled to drop it to 3.

It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong; it was average.

For me average means it is hardly worth the effort to describe. Only the truly outstanding or the truly awful deserve the time.

Would I nevertheless recommend going? FOR SURE! 

Food is not everything my friends. 

Go for the music and the ambiance. It is a wonderfully eclectic spot with interesting people and if you pick the right night, great tunes. 

Word to the wise: don't book right next to  the stage as  we did. Those in the know go up the back. Music is plenty loud enough and you have the added bonus of being able to converse with your fellow raconteurs.

One negative: they have a  mandatory coat check of all things. I think it was $3 per coat. Feels like a  money grab."}
{"text":"We went there on vacation. The food was good and the jazz quintet excellent."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really quite lovely but the quality of the food doesn't live up to the prices - this is an establishment to watch music.  We found our entrées (ribs and jambalaya) to be so-so at best. But did I mention the ambiance is lovely?  There are mirrors and chandeliers everywhere.  Beautiful decor.

Note on the food: allergy sufferers beware. I'm very lactose intolerant and checked with the server if my meal was dairy free, ready to stick to my old standby of a salad if necessary.  She assured me it was safe, and it wasn't at all - I had horrible symptoms after the meal.  These days almost all restaurants are easily able to accommodate people with allergies, so I don't think it's acceptable for staff to be totally uninformed/uninterested in verifying ingredients/untruthful to customers because they don't care if patrons get sick there. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great music, uneasy feeling food.

Snooksta and the Gangstas certainly kept me at the edge of my seat.  Even the saxophone player held it together after his instrument broke, singing his part. 

Food was disappointing.  When you hear jazz, you think New Orleans. When you think New Orleans, you thknk jumbalaya. My jumbalaya was mainly canned food.  There were pieces of overcooked fresh orange pepper mixed in. The sauce lacked the usual flavorful starchy goodness and resembled more of a ketchup. There also wasn't enough of that ketchupy mixture to complement the rice. The mussels decorated the plate well. Their consistency was more like chicken. I believe I had a piece of shrimp, but it tasted and felt like chicken. There was also chicken in the dish.  It was a little too salty and was styled after pulled pork (it could have been canned chicken). The sausage was spiced well, but lacked the meat juice that usually stays within the meat. (I believe it was overcooked, but it could have also been frozen.)  A couple nect to us also haf yhr jumbalaya, but also picked at it thoughout the night.  They left early.

My wife had steak. It was much better. The steak retained the pinky goodness usually found in medium steak. She loved her meal. I should have picked that one. 

The desserts were alright. The usual high end frozen cakes that taste so good. I think my piece was hit by a little freezer burn.  One piece of chocolate tasted a little sour.  They poured Hershey's chocolate sauce on top, but not in any particular design, more of a covering than a drizzle.

The wine was great and cheap.  Our $30 bottle of red didn't fall flat and could certainly hold its own against a $50 bottle from places in Old City, Montreal.

I felt uncomfortable in the middle of the evening.  It started 45 minutes after my first bite of the jumbalaya (it was probably the jumbalaya). The band was so good, I didn't realize how sick I was getting.  I stayed the whole night.  When we got back, I immediately had to use the rest room.

The night cost $140, including our entrees, 1 bottle of wine, $10 per person cover charge to the awesome band, $8 for fancy frozen cake, and $5.50 for coffee for two.

I really can't say enough about the band.  They were worth $140 for 2 tickets anyday. I just didn't realize it was going to be today."}
{"text":"1 st time in Montreal wanted a romantic evening with the hub. Performance was nice. Seating should be more spread out. Lighting is awful, should dim lights more. Service was not great.  Slow service. Ribs were horrible."}
{"text":"Had a great time, went for my birthday and brought a tuango coupon with me.

The food was really good tried escargot for the first time here. Also the salmon which was juicy and tender...I liked how for dessert the creme brulee came with three flavours one regular, one chocolate and the third one tasted orangey..mmmmmmm

The show was entertaining and made me daydream(lol), atmosphere very romantic perfect for a first date! ;)

Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Jazz was pretty good. Scene was definitely interesting. Food was not amazing but not terribly overpriced either. The $5 cover was added to our bill which we found convenient. Atmosphere is really chill at this spot. Had a good time but not sure that i would go back. Heard this place was a much livelier spot when it was the old Biddles. Perhaps it's becoming a bit dated?"}
{"text":"Wow!!!Quelle ambiance extraordinaire! Super spectacle de Jazz, un service impeccable et la nourriture excellente. Je recommande ce restaurant pour une soirée réussie!

What a great place for a jazz night, great food and service. An evening I will never forget!"}
{"text":"I love this place! 
Service is always top notch, and the entertainment is great! From the moment I walked in, I knew it would be a good night (well, night*s* - I got the same feeling both times I went here). The music is soulful and full of life. Mirrors line the stage and stage ceiling so you can watch the musicians work their magic from any seat. The decor is pretty over the top, but that's what I love about it. Giant chandeliers, wine bottles on the wall, stained glass and grape-cluster lights, horse and dog statues - quite a bit of visual stimuli. The waiters and waitresses are efficient, friendly, and very attentive. The chicken and ribs combo is really good, and the chicken wings have a nice kick. The escargot were garlicky and delicious. The potato skins are nothing to write home about - they're topped with imitation bacon and lack a bit of oomph. The martini with port is pretty good, too. The creme brulee trio is presented nicely, and is quite good. 
There's just something about being here that puts the rest of the world on hold so that you just enjoy good company, good music, and good food."}
{"text":"This place is for Jazz lover more than foodies .... 
but for those who have been there before, their food and wine collection has been significantly improved."}
{"text":"Yeah well, it wasn't what we'd expected and was frightfully expensive. $50+ for two tiny, thin cocktails and less than 10 minutes of music on a Saturday night . The doorman said we could sit at the bar but then we were diverted off into a \"doctor's waiting room\" already occupied by a large party. The two of us were the only outsiders in the odd side room and felt like party crashers. We also could not appreciate the point of enjoying the performance by watching it on low quality video on big TV screen and hearing it through speakers in the ceiling in competition with the conversation of folks who could have cared less about the . We were given the choice of enduring it or leaving. We left, but were still nicked for the cover charges, the mandatory coat check fees, drinks and the rest."}
{"text":"I just went to this place for a drink and listen to some Jazz music. 

Here's what I learned in 1.5 hour:
This is one place where you love the live music and ambiance.  But everything else is less than you desired. I went to the bar and waited 10 minutes before I was greeted by the bartender.  The bartender was only half attentive because he was swamped with orders.   So I can't blame the bartender for the slow service. 

In addition,  my neighbors at the bar ordered an appetizer and they left without the appetizer (you get the picture). 

In summary, I'd love to see this place to continue with live music.  Please find some ways to improve the service. 

The $10 cover charge is not a problem with me if you provide some good services."}
{"text":"This place is nuts.
I'm surprised that every review isn't about the decor of this club. It's kind of beyond description; it was actually a bit dizzying.
Also, no one mentions the panda bears out front. Some sort of panda bear jazz group? Or the awesomely cheesy Blues Brothers guy tacked on the corner of the building? Or the retro cocktail menu?
What an experience.
To be fair, once you get past all the nuttiness, the staff was all friendly, our drinks arrived quickly, and people who listen to more jazz than I do thought the combo playing that night was good."}
{"text":"I just downloaded the yelp app just to complain about this place. 

Walking in, the decor was amazing and we were supper excited for our night.

We came as a group of 25 for my uncle's 50th so they sat us upstairs in the back room.

Service was so slow. We couldn't get service for drinks for the life of us. Our food was a set meal and we received it in periods of 45-1hr intervals. By the time we got our main meal, All of us were full. Not only that, most of us didn't even receive our meals. When my brother said he didn't want his anymore (everyone had finished their meals) the waitress gave us a snarky remark saying it was in the kitchen. Sorry but if my food is has been \"in your kitchen\" for 45 min, I especially don't want it anymore. Plus everything was terrible. Ribs were bland and dry, chicken was black and they forgot my moms bocaccio cheese in her gnocchi so they brought it after. My cousin had to serve us water since no one came after the main meal.

Our table was by lockers which they apparently lock booze in for customers? What the hell is that. We had a group of two drunk men and two drunk women search for their locker for 30 minutes right beside our table. 

When that was over, my uncles cake came. After 30 minutes my aunt had to politely ask if they could cut and serve it to us on dessert plates!! They didn't bring spoons or plates for us, just the cake. 

Ridiculous and so disappointing. Hire more workers to help the staff that's obviously struggling. Either change your menu to good food or turn it into a tapas menu so we can actually be hungry for the $30 meal we ordered.

Not happy."}
{"text":"Do not come here to eat. This is a nice place for drinks and decent music, but the food service was awful. The prices were outrageous, even for Montreal standards. The quality of the food was very poor and the waiter seemed inconvenienced that he was serving us. This was relatively early in the dinner service and the place was only about 50% full, so there was no reason for the poor service."}
{"text":"Hello, I just purchased a travelzoo coupon and I am trying to figure out if the shows are at the Montreal establishment or at the Laval establishment. I am coming into Montreal today and would love to see the show, I just can't figure out through the website which ones are open. The reservation seems to only be available for the one in Laval. Can Anyone please help me?"}
{"text":"Having been to several jazz clubs in Montreal, New York, San Francisco, Philadelphia, etc., this place was very different from what I expected, especially based on the other reviews. 

My first impression upon walking in was: \"I feel very over-dressed.\" It's not like I was in formal attire or anything: I was just dressed for dinner and music on a Friday night! But I felt awkward because most of the crowd in this place was wearing shorts, oversized t-shirts, baseball caps, and cross-trainers with tube socks. It's not unusual to see some very casual attire at a jazz venue (ex: t-shirts and jeans), but not like this. I wish I'd been prepared for that and dressed accordingly so I didn't feel so out of place. And it was weird to see the crowd dressed this way, given the decor and the staff's attire. That juxtaposition made it feel like I was eating in a jazz-themed restaurant at Disney World or something. Just... Not what I expected.

But the more important stuff: service was great, the staff were very friendly and accommodating, and the band was excellent... So it was a real shame that I could barely hear them thanks to chatter from the audience. It seemed that 90% of the crowd didn't appreciate the music: they talked over it the entire time, getting louder whenever the band played louder. Nobody seemed to be paying attention at all! 

Despite the great service and great music, the weird \"theme restaurant\" vibe and the crowd's disrespect for the performance kind of killed the experience for my date and I. So, we left pretty early. We headed to Diese Onze afterwards and had a much better time, the biggest difference being that the audience was actually engaged with the show instead of talking over it.

Maybe our experience isn't typical, so I would still come back (dressed more appropriately, I guess). But I would be sure to make a reservation, hopefully to get a table closer to the band and hear less of the crowd's chatter. I've also seen other jazz clubs make announcements asking the crowd to please minimize talking during the performance, which seems to work well. I'm not sure if they usually do that here, but it didn't happen while we were there. Overall pretty disappointing, although not because of the service or the band."}
{"text":"This place is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too pricey for the quality of the food. I've paid these kinds of prices in much higher end restaurants in Montreal for exceptional food. This food was far from exceptional. It was good, but that's about it. It wants to come across as something it's not.
I assumed the prices were higher due to the fact that they offer live music. That's how I justified it, but then i saw they charge a $10/pp cover on the bill. I don't like being bamboozled, so seeing the cover charge on my bill that doesn't appear anywhere -website; entrance... pissed me off.
Drinks are super expensive too. What we paid for drinks cost only a few dollars less than buying a full bottle at the store! 12$ an oz for standard booze? Ridiculous.
The place has a good vibe but it's irrelevant now as I won't go back. Our group spent a couple of hundred bucks on a mediocre meal- why would we return when there are so many better places to eat? 
(Bianca our server was great though. Attentive and good). The hostess can use a lesson in being welcoming. Someone should remind her she's working in a restaurant, not a funeral home. 
They also require you to check your coat....
I now understand why H o J is always on Groupon. It's probably the only way to get people in the door."}
{"text":"The place is \"subtle\" on all levels...

Super touristic, the food is terrible! Worst we have had in montreal so far!

Music was terribly loud, there were nearly no one there, so I guess the musician also cared less... But the speakers are so loud that it hurts our ears, what a shame, could have been great...

Our waitress was nice, but I guess that's not enough for a return..."}
{"text":"Un gros bof pour cet endroit. La musique etait bonne mais la nourriture etait vraiment ordinaire ! J'avais beaucoup d'attente et j'ai été déçu. Le concept est cool à la base, mais il est ma exploité. 

Bref rien qui me donne le gout de retourner à cet endroit !"}
{"text":"The entertainment was spectacular, The food was horrible. The ribs were tough, bad flavor, the jambalaya was fishy, no taste and very very disappointing. If we ever come back, it will just be for the Jazz, not the food!"}
{"text":"Le service le plus lent que j'ai jamais vu!!!

Le restaurant a beau être plein, ce n'est pas normal que ce soit aussi lent. 

Nous avions profité d'une offre Tuango pour ce restaurant: 69$ pour un souper 5 services pour 2, apéritif inclus. 

Nous sommes arrivés à 19:00, nous avons reçu l'apéritif il était passé 19:30! Il y avait un long temps d'attente entre les services, nous avons reçu le plat principal vers 21:00 et cela parce que je me suis plaint de la lenteur du service. Des gens arrivés avant nous n'ont eu leur plat principal que vers 21:30

La qualité des plats  était très variable: la soupe, une crème de légumes, était bonne; la salade, très simple: mélange de verdure avec vinaigrette balsamique. Ensuite, on nous a servi une entrée à partager: une terrine de saumon avec 3 petites tranches de pain... Pour plat principal, j'ai choisi le steak de surlonge, alors que ma copine à choisi le jarret de veau avec sauce au champignon: le steak était bon, mais le veau avait peu de goût et la sauce donnait l'impression d'être une sauce en boîte. Finalement, le dessert, un gâteau au fromage, était bon. 

Si vous aimez le jazz, aller d'abord manger ailleurs et rendez-vous ensuite à la maison du jazz pour prendre un verre en écoutant la musique: votre expérience sera meilleure."}
{"text":"Visiting a jazz club is an iconic Montreal experience.  House of Jazz was recommended by our hotel and they didn't steer us wrong.  The place oozed atmosphere, with giant chandeliers reflecting off lots of mirrors, plus stained glass ceilings, bronze statues and massive wooden bars.  There was an intimate smoky feel to the club but without the smoke.  Patrons included a nice mix of regulars (fans of Bob Ricci, a regular Sunday night performer), plus visitors and those celebrating special occasions.  The crowd definitely skewed older earlier in the evening.

The menu has a BBQ/New Orleans slant.  I ordered the chicken and rib combo, a half a chicken that was fall off the bone tender, plus 4-5 ribs that followed suit.  The barbeque sauce, though, had a different taste.  I generally prefer something sweeter and a more traditional sauce would have been better.  But, overall, the kitchen turns out pretty good food.

If you visit, call ahead and make a reservation, especially if you're a table of two.  Otherwise you might end up in front of the band in a noisy spot not conducive to talking.  You can avoid the cover charge by eating on the patio, but you'll lose that jazz club feel.  We found a small spot on a railing bar that was the perfect spot for viewing all the action.

All in all, we had a delightful evening."}

{"text":"I went to the House of Jazz on a Saturday night and lived an incredible pop soul groovy funky jazz performance by local singer Elizabeth Blouin-Brathwaite. The crowd was singing and dancing by the end. I have never seen this kind of energy at a jazz club.

The setup is less intimate than at Upstairs where I'm a regular. But the décor is very upscale and iconic. On tap I took a Boréale at $7 a pint. The cover charge is fixed and quite steep ($10 + $2 mandatory coat check).

Keep in mind that I don't go to jazz clubs for the food."}
{"text":"Went there because I had a tango coupon. Live music was ok and the food was good. It is in a tourist area so they don't work to hard to attract people. Was told that the laval location was better for food and music. Decor at the montreal location was nice."}
{"text":"The music was okay the night we went. Service from the bar was BAD.

The bartender with the sour face and attitude should not be working with the public. She was rather curt, bordering on rude, and looked like she was ready to pound someone on the head at any moment. I saw how she spoke to other clients who were also taken aback by her abruptness. 

We ordered our drinks and asked for a glass of water at the same time. The drinks came, but no water. She dropped off the bill and quickly whisked away without giving us a chance to ask for that glass of water she had forgotten to bring.  It took a while to get her attention again, and when I asked for the glass of water, she nodded and whisked away again. Another 10 mins later, still no water. Had to wave down another bartender for that glass of water. WTF?"}

{"text":"Endroit très sympa, à l'ancienne, d'ailleurs la Maison a été fondée en 1980. A noter que dans la note de présentation de l'endroit (sur le menu), le nouveau propriétaire ne parle pas du tout du fondateur qui a donné son succès à l'endroit, ce qui est très dommage, et on dirait qu'il s'attribue toute la gloire..
Bref, hormis cela, la Maison du Jazz est l'endroit idéal pour une bonne soirée Live Jazz, en couple, entre amis, en famille. Il y a plusieurs tables un peu partout, et toutes donnent sur la scène.
Il faut regarder sur le site les horaires et dates des shows.
Par contre au niveau de la bouffe, j'ai trouvé ça très moyen, presque de type cantine... (soupe ou salade de base en entrée, plat avec riz sec ou légumes, peu de sauce et peu de raffinement pour les plats, apparemment les cotes levées valent la peine par contre)
A essayer car une institution de Montréal tout de même!"}

Though it was packed and the drinks were pricey- we actually lucked out and made our home at a table right in front of the stage. It was a blast! It's definately a great ice-breaker place. The decor is amazing- I could wander and gaze at it for hours (check out the pics). I'm sure the restaurant area is expensive and romantic, but I'm sure worth a try."}

{"text":"I, Ludwig Facessen of the Cannibal Resto Review, am happy to announce that although La Maison du Jazz does not serve human flesh (such a pity), the entertainment is fantastic. It's even philosophically engaging. I'll explain. 


Sure, the food is alright. Overpriced, but alright. I attribute these prices to the fact that this is a restaurant that uses live jazz music to attract customers. Certainly they must pay their acts.

However, as in the arts, there are also nights wherein jazz performers are on a probationary watch or auditioning and THESE are the nights to attend La Maison du Jazz. 

Picture this: you are at a restaurant. You order a forgetful yet appetizing dish. You turn your attention to the stage where young performers are playing virtuously. They are students who have yet to complete their degrees in music. Their sweat is born of hard work and the anxiety of the possibility that they may be asked to return for a paid performance. Or at least a callback. 

THEY are truly what make me salivate. So if you are to make a reservation, be sure to ask if young students who are nervous about their status with the restaurant are going to perform. If they are, bring everyone you can. Because they will enjoy the meal more with the prospect of this small fear. 


Regular rating: 3 stars. 
Cannibal rating: 3 stars. But extra points for entertainment."}
{"text":"La Maison du Jazz est un restaurant où il y a un show de musique (de jazz) pendant que tu manges. Il faut aimer le jazz.

Le groupe de musique est arrivé vers 20h et je suis content d'avoir été présent avant, car c'est pas idéal pour parler durant la prestation. 

La prestation était très bien! C'était du jazz et nous étions bien contents ma copine et moi du show.

Il y a une ambiance vraiment vintage, autant dans le décor que dans les bancs. (Ok, ça fait partie du décor).

La bouffe était \"Ok\". Ce n'est pas vraiment pour la gastronomie que vous y irez, mais bien pour profiter d'un spectacle de jazz en mangeant. 

Par contre, j'ai bien aimé le dessert qui était trois crèmes brûlées de saveurs différentes. mmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"I had a great time here this past weekend.  It's the kind of spot where at one point I looked around thinking, \"why the heck haven't I been here before!\"  The music was awesome, and just the right volume.  I was there with friends and we could still talk and also watch the show.

If it wasn't for the food I would have rated it 5 stars.  The food was good, but not 5 star good.  I ordered the rib eye.  Nothing spectacular, and unfortunately that fries that accompanied it seemed like they were frozen from a package.  (my apologies if they are not...)

Whether you are a jazz music fan or not I am sure you will have a great time here.  The audience was of mixed ages from early 20's to experienced ones...service was a little slow, but with the music to enjoy it wasn't a big deal.

Not noly will I go again, but will bring my guests here in the future.  I'd be proud to share this place as a representation of Montreal culture."}
{"text":"Now I consider myself a fan of jazz music, but with over a decade of going out in different clubs and bars throughout Montreal, I never once thought to visit the House of Jazz. After going there for the first time to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday, I will definitely consider going back before going to many other places. 

Since it was Saturday night there was a 10$ cover charge. It was the birthday boy's idea, so nobody really complained and I was just happy we paid 10$ to get into a jazz bar rather than a strip club.

The first thing you notice as you walk in as how much of an old school feel this place has. It easily felt like I can be in a New York or even in a New Orleans jazz bar. The lighting is great, and the accessories and pictures throughout the bar make for a great atmosphere while you sit back and enjoy some good music. 

I did not get a chance to sample anything from the food menu but did try their signature alcoholic coffee drink which was pretty good, although a little too sweet for my taste. The one thing that bothered me and my group of friends, was how hot it was in the bar. This was an early October evening and it felt like it was well over 30 degrees in there, which had most of us sweating.

A second visit to the House of Jazz is definitely in store for me in the future, as I am curious about their food items and menu. I'll just make sure to visit on a weekday to avoid the 10$ cover charge on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"I had to think of some options for a jazz club, and while there are quite a few places to go in this great city, La Maison is a bit of an institution and it was also convenient at the time for where I was staying.

The place as you probably know from reading, has a mandatory coat check, cover.. etc...

I did not have any of the food, but settled in at a much later time to hear some music and just have a drink and take it in easy for the late night. The vibe here is classic, huge amounts of wood, chandeliers, green naugahyde booths with brass rivets, giving a great feel.  Much eye candy in ambience.  The waitresses wear flapper style feathers from their hair, and the place feels classy, but it also looks like that even with the cover they don't really enforce a dresscode either.

I am a big cocktail fan, and the options here listed are some of the basics, with a list of martinis that range to basic standards to has beens (apple and chocolate I am looking at you).  My wife went for an Americano, props for having this on the menu and I asked for a Brandy Alexander which unfortunately was made with milk and not cream like it should, but this is disclosed on the menu.  It was also served on ice which in my opinion is a big no no.

I get the impression they are not big on the cocktails here, this is not a cocktail nerds paradise by any stretch.  Drink service is also a little slow, but nothing horrid, but a floor manager dressed impecably would often come out with what appeared to be warmed home made chips with salt and black pepper to our table and others.

Still the place is a bit pricey to see some music, and you are paying for the atmosphere.  I liked this place but certainly didn't fall in love with it.  It also has decent acoustics.  But if it's in your area it's worth checking out, it is an institution no question."}

Il y a un cover charge de 10$ pour les musiciens qui le méritent amplement. La déco est digne des bars de la Nouvelle Orléans, disparate, vieillot mais chic, sombre, chargé mais de bon goût. Les serveuses portent des robes à paillettes, des plumes, beaucoup de maquillage, elles sont superbes. Notre réservation était pour 18:00, la serveuse nous offre des apéros, elle nous précise que les plats principaux sont servis tranquillement lors du spectacle (qui commence à 19:00), c'est bien qu'ils le précisent. Comme entrée, plateau de fromages, calmars et escargots. Bon, les calmars ne sont clairement pas fait sur place et c'est correct, mais ils n'étaient pas de la meilleure qualité des TOUT-FAIT, un peu déçu, quand on choisit du TOUT-FAIT, on prend le meilleur. J'en ai déjà acheté des meilleurs à l'épicerie. Les escargots étaient bons. Comme plats principaux, Ribs/frites et Jambalaya. Les plats étaient tièdes, pas froid, mais pas non plus chaud, le goût était correct, sans plus. Pendant ce temps le groupe joue et nous fait balancer sur des rythmes jazzés connus. Ils en profitent pour souligner l'anniversaire du papa et lui dédier une chanson. Merci pour cette attention. Ils ont joué de 19:00 à 22:00 avec une petite pause. Vraiment tout un show, malgré une salle qui n'était pas du tout remplit à sa pleine capacité, il y avait une belle ambiance. Même que vers 21:00 on avait un show privé. On y va pour l'ambiance, les drinks et l'expérience et non pas pour la bouffe. P.S.: En été la terrasse est ouverte."}
{"text":"Cool new spot in Laval with cool vibes, wacky decor and live music. 

Disclaimer: review is based on a table d'hote menu from Valentine's Day, so I can't speak about its everyday menu. 

The table d'hote menu that night was very well thought out and put creative twists on foods to -up- the romance, so to speak. It was a bit of a hit and miss with the food, but ultimately the experience didn't warrant anything less than four stars.

I started with a light salad. This was less than two weeks ago and I can safely say I don't remember a thing about this salad except that it was green. I think it was good?

Second course was the escargots with the phyllo dough pastry concoction. Beautifully presented but didn't taste nearly as good. Remember the movie It Takes Two with the Olsen twins? Where one of them goes to a cocktail party, walks around and gets offered an escargot? And then she spits it out and says something along the lines of \"ew why does this taste like balloon!\" That about sums this course up. 

Mid-meal cleanse: A grapefruit/banana sorbet in a shot glass. COOL. Got to rid the balloon taste from my mouth.

Mains: Thank god. Nice chunk of beef with great mashed potatoes and some bacon. Just great. Good protein makes up for everything.

Dessert: French Almond cake. Thank god again. 2 for 2. This cake was simple, no fuss, and delicious. 

The live music was really amazing. Great pianist and cellist, doing their thing. Had no idea what they played until their very last song, which was the charlie brown song. Also, props to the resto for going around and passing out roses to the men to give to their ladies. Nice touch.

Crowd-wise: I felt like a little boy with his kindergarten girlfriend, so it was a little bit of an older crowd. Whatever. I'll still be back for drinks."}
{"text":"J'avais si hâte d'y aller et j'ai été vraiment déçue... Le service est moyen, la bouffe est très très ordinaire et très très chère, la musique est extrêmement forte (nous devions crier pour se faire entendre) et le restaurant est vieux, fade.

Bref, je n'y retournerai pas."}
{"text":"For all the jazz lovers out there, this place is for you! 

I always wanted to try this restaurant because I love jazz music and when you combine it with food, it is a paradise made for me. My family, boyfriend and I sat very close to the live band show. The music is wonderful. The food is a mixture of Cajun and American style. Some of the food I had in New Orleans, like the jambalaya and a lot of seafood option. The decoration of the place is really beautiful. 

I am a little confused about paying the bands at least 10$ EACH. It gets extremely pricey and it motivates me less to come back for a live night. 

Overall, the atmosphere is beautiful, the food is good (not as good as good old New Orleans itself but it is passable) and I will definitely come back when I am a little richer."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and Jazz.   The decor is sort of over the top/heavy on decorations, but it is kind of fun..    We ordered the chicken nachos and the caesar salad.  Both were good and well prepared.   The drinks were a bit on the watered down side, but the music was good.  Overall a nice experience.    There is a cover !"}
{"text":"US California customer here!

This place plays live jazz EVERY night!? Do I need to say anything more? 

I came here after dinner to listen to some live music. I was not disappointed. \"Snookstas and the Ganstas\" were amazing !!! 

I didn't come here for the food so I can't really say much about it. The other reviewers and the google reviews have nothing good to say about the food but everything positive about the music. 

I did order a plate of fries and water. The water was great! The fries were bland and meh... if you come here to enjoy great live music... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Worst experience! They don't even know what's the service ! Atmosphere, ok. But, the service is the first element to consider. Just go the street crescent, so many bar/resto better than it."}
{"text":"On my first night in Montreal, I was much later than the rest of my party due to a long wait at the border. As such, they had eaten already and I had not. The concierge at my hotel that suggested that we try this place that was right around the corner to please all.  His comment, \"you won't be disappointed.\"  He was right.  

For a purportedly famous place, this wasn't half bad.  It's billed as a jazz and dinner club with live jazz music every night it's open.  First off, the place was small which gave it an intimate feel.  It was full but but not crowded and we didn't have to wait for a seat (of course we was there on a late evening on Thursday too).  Being the only one in my party who was eating, we sat at the bar which didn't have great views of the stage.  This didn't bother me because I don't go to SEE jazz, I go to HEAR jazz and the club has great acoustics.  The tables (with few exceptions) have good stage views.  Table space is at a premium, BTW.  The jazz was a blues-jazz type improv group and was great.  Regardless of whether you eat or not, it's a $5 cover charge for shows.

As for the food, the menu was mostly salads and barbeque chicken and pork ribs.  Now I am a vegetarian, but when the wait staff says their best dish is the chicken and pork ribs combo, by golly, I'll have the chicken and pork ribs combo.  And for someone who hasn't eaten meat in the last 15 years, it wasn't a bad way to fall off the wagon.  The pork was falling off the bone, the chicken was succulent and the portions were enough for two people.  The ribs are barbeque'd Memphis-style with a brown sugar and tomato based glaze and the chicken is grilled with the a less sweet barbeque sauce on the side.  The club's decor is funky and seedy: they have crystal chandeliers and old brass instruments on the wall with endless paintings.  The dress code: Montreal nice (chic dresses or skirts for the ladies, button down shirts and slacks for the men; no sneakers).  The prices were downside:  the entree was $25-30/plate, add on a drink ($7), the $5 cover charge and tax, and the bill was a hair over $45...for one person.  Not what I normally would have spent on one meal during a casual night out.

Would I eat there again? No. Why? I'm just not that into meat.  Would I go again for the show?  Absolutely; even on the off nights, the jazz is white hot."}
{"text":"The company I work for recently had our Christmas party there (there were 85 of us and we took over the restaurant).

I imagine it would be a fun place to have supper and stay for some tunes.  But it wasn't conducive for an office party.  It was too small for cocktails before dinner.  It got roomier once we sat down for supper.

Supper was good ... cole slaw, fries, 1/4 chicken, a couple ribs and dipping sauce.  It tasted like St. Hubert's.  

The music during supper was really LOUD and we wouldn't hear each other.  We had to ask to have it turned down a bit.  The band was good."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Had a fabulous time!! We used a travelzoo voucher and we weren't treated any different than the other patrons. I am allergic to salmon and that was to be our appetizer, no problem they changed it to duck appetizer. I've never had duck before and it was delicious. My husband had veal shank and I had chicken and ribs. Both meals were out of this world!! Melt in your mouth goodness, we had martinis included in the voucher and they were very good, dessert was heavenly!! The music was amazing and truly made the night!! At no time did we feel rushed to pay our bill. We had a few more drinks and stayed well over 3 hrs. The atmosphere was amazing!! Our server was great and everyone had a smile on their faces. We will definitely return on our next trip to Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Endroit vraiment relaxe, super classy avec des show de jazz régulier. Bon drinks et bonne bouffe !"}
{"text":"C'est toujours un moment agréable de se retrouver à la maison du jazz à Laval je vous avouerai que ce n'est pas la première fois que j'y vais et je suis toujours ravi du spectacle de musique qui nous est offert.  Le menu n'est pas compliqué et se compose de quelques entrées et d'une dizaine de plats. Le service est excellent et le maître d'hôtel Sébastien est toujours à son affaire et c'est un plaisir de le rencontrer. Nous y sommes allés avec un couple d'amis qui pour eux étais la première fois.  Une des chansonniers très populaire là-bas est Miss Sweaney.  À elle seule cette grande dame donne tout un spectacle. Pour ceux qui n'y est jamais allé à maison du jazz offre un atmosphère des plus charmante si ce n'est juste des nombreux lustres qui ornent  le plafond."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is about. Seriously.

We made reservations for 7pm and were promptly seated immediately in front of the stage. We asked for a different seat in the room left of the stage as we didn't want to be deafened.

Food is not even worth mentioning. We got chicken rice soup (soup du jour) and buffalo wings and potato skin combo. Both seemed straight out of the package. Soup was peppery and better. We then waited. And waited. And waited an hour for our entrees to arrive. The waitress eventually acknowledged us (after my long stare downs) that the kitchen (and not the service) lost the paper and our ordered were lost. By then, it was already 930pm. We were starving and wolfed down our entrees by 950pm. Was the food good? No. The ribs were wayy to sweet. My filet was not bad. Was it worth the 27 and 33 CAD$ respectively? No.

I'm from NY. I've been to my fair share of Jazz clubs. Was this place phenomenon? No. Was it pricey as if it should have been? Yes. 

I'd rather not return and not recommend it to others. Save your 140 CAD$ and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"House of Jazz was recommended by some locals. Reservation is required. Tables right up against the stage. You walk in and get to your table by the host. Bar to the left and seating area at the back and into the side. You can see the stage from whichever direction. Depending on the performer- you may sit and enjoy the music but also can be pulled up on stage to dance. Recommend sitting in mid section as you can see and hear the music. Won't be too loud and you won't have your back to the performers or be knocked down by avid dancers who want to dance on stage. Food itself was good. Pricey but reasonable portions - ordered the Paella- spicy with Louisiana touch. Drinks were good. Did not have desert but others did and people commented on how good their was. Cost of admission also part of the bill just a heads up. Did not have to coat check so no issues."}
{"text":"The House of Jazz has the chandeliers and mirrors. There is a big stage and large menu. The crowd on Sunday night was quite grey. And the music on this night was for them."}
{"text":"Between mandatory coat check and music cover charge, I had paid $14 before I even sat down at my special, young adult table; conveniently located obnoxiously close to a floor speaker.

The food was of a price that I'd expect from Baton Rouge with a quality and selection I'd expect from St. Hubert. Thank goodness I had a coupon off a deal site for this place. I managed to avoid wasting an obscene amount of money on the dining experience and instead opting for only wasting a moderate amount. 

The service was way to slow for 2 dishes (one being a salad). However, my waiter extremely helpful in notifying me, using a beautiful assortment of circles and arrows, that the tipping is to be done on the original amount, not the discounted one.

I had high hopes for this place but it's clear that the 20-25 age group are looked down upon here. When the service goes sour, the food isn't good enough to be the sole justification of dining here."}
{"text":"$10 cover charge?  $2 mandatory coat check?  Came in last night around 9:45pm bc I like Jazz.  The first thing is that you enter what looks like a whore house or a casino.  You're then greeted by a lady that makes you check in your coat.  I asked the maître d how long the music was playing til, he said 10pm.  The music did not seem to be good and the place looked empty so we left.  This place is not worth it.  We left.  Recommend upstairs a lot more."}
{"text":"When I showed up, at 7:45pm, there was not much going on. The music supposedly starts around 8:30pm. But they have a really fascinating, and endlessly entertaining clip reel playing while you wait. It is all sorts of old jazz clips (Satchmo, Ma Rainy, Herbie Hancock) and it is hooked up to their great sound system. I was on my own, so it kept me entertained. 
The music was pretty mellow when I came. It was a piano led quartet, nothing earth shaking, but decent. The food was ok. I ordered the ribs/chicken combo. The ribs were tastey, but not tender the way you want your BBQ, and the chicken was dry  in spots, but again, tasted good. I would say the star was the cole slaw. (of all things)  Desserts were nothing to mention, and a note to iced tea drinkers, theirs is sweet, as, I suppose, you would expect from a BBQ place. The service started off alright, but by about 9 I was pretty sure my waitress was the only person working the floor. It prolonged the meal quite a bit, but seeing as how I was charged an extra $5 to see the show (on top of the rather pricey food) I was fine with the extra wait. Hell, at least they weren't rushing me out to turn over the tables.
The decor is absolutely awesome, hard to describe. Looks great, though. Lots going on!
This place would be better if you were with friends."}
{"text":"I went here cause I found a deal on Groupon and a friend had recommended I check it out. The music was nice, but wow the food was not good at all. Dry ribs, bland chicken, ok fries, the dessert was great however but I'm pretty sure thats cause they buy their cakes from somewhere else and can't actually bake something that tasty themselves. Won't come back for the food that is for sure."}
{"text":"Super nice ambiance and awesome jazz music! It's a bit expensive but still worth it :) If you're a bit low on the budget, the beers are fairly priced ($7 a pinte) and there are 2 chicken options on the menu that are 14$ and 16$. 

The place is really super well decorated and it has a sophisticated vibe. I was expecting mellow jazz but I went there with friends on a Friday night and the band was super upbeat."}
