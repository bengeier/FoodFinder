{"text":"I live right across the street, and still never noticed this place! I'm not familiar with Egyptian food, but I liked the intro dishes I tried here! The Koshari was tasty (the pictures in the restaurant don't do it justice), and I'm excited to try more.

The Mexican food/etc won't change your life, but it's a steal at $5. I was surprised by how fresh the ingredients in my burrito were. Restaurants at this price level are typically more on the questionable side, but I was quite satisfied with my burrito."}
{"text":"Walked here from the Air Canada Centre on a Friday night after the Rising Stars game. I checked yelp before coming here and it said it was open til 3 AM. Sadly they were closed and it wasn't even 11 Pm. Wasted my time coming here."}
{"text":"Ahmed is a delightful man from Cairo with a small shop at this location.   The food was great and this is the only time I have ever seen Koshari outside of Egypt.   Great inexpensive middle eastern food in the heart of Toronto!   A new favorite place."}
{"text":"I got to try Baba Geddo as it had set up shop for an event that I was attending. The ownership were incredibly, incredibly sweet and that in itself deserves 5 stars.  I got a chicken shawarma sandwich and basbousa.  Both weren't the best that I've had, but really hit the spot.

Definitely visit Baba Geddo to get some good food and very hospitable and warm service!"}
{"text":"After being underwhelmed by Healthy Greek's chicken gyro I decided to walk around the corner and I am so happy I made the decision.

ATMOSPHERE: The place is small with only a few tables, fortunately I live in the area and was just looking for take-out anyway.

SELECTION: This place is kind of crazy, they sell a million different mediterranean  items and then also Mexican. I questioned whether it was good or not and apparently the owners have Mexican friends who live close and suggested since they had most of the ingredients already there they should expand. 

To prove quality they gave me some fresh guacamole and salsa to try. 

SERVICE: I was so overwhelmed at how nice these people are. I was staring blankly at the menu board and the woman told me I could basically have whatever I wanted as a combo and they'd figure it out. I ordered a chicken pita and salad for $7.99 and when I mentioned I liked falafel she gave me one to try and said they make it fresh, not from a mix. It tasted exactly like the ones I had in Jordan. I will definitely be back,

FOOD: This will likely become my go-to place for take-out, there is so much selection, they emphasize freshness and are so friendly I can't help but choose them over others in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but it's not worth my time going back.  I ordered 1 falafel.  The falafel balls tasted like stringy carpet, and, to make matters worse, there was a hair in my wrap and the garlic sauce was thick and really gross as well.  I would strongly advise that you never visit this establishment."}
{"text":"I got the falafel platter and wow, it was some of the best falafel I've had.

The player is very filling and comes with six falafels a pita you can have many different options with it for example humus.


Once again amazing felafel, not to soft but moist inside and crispy outside. Hint order on downtime like 1pm he has two businesses out of the same restaurant and can dedicate more time to your order around then."}
{"text":"We were in the area and my wife decided to give this place a try. After going inside, this place is 3 restaurants in one. 

You can purchase Middle Eastern food, Mexican and Pita sandwiches. The store is very small with 2 tiny tables and one counter by the window. We went with the Middle Eastern cuisine. My wife got the Kofta Kabob platter and I got the Shish Tawook platter. The food was just okay. The food was already pre-made and they just reheat it when you order. They don't serve it fresh. Portions are generous. 

I like to acknowledge the older gentleman who served us as he was attentive and answered the food questions we had. Too bad the food could not match his attentiveness..."}
{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ this place.

It's a bit confusing. If you're walking north on Duncan, you'll see a big sign that says \"12-inch Burritos! $5.99 daily special!\" but then if you're walking from the other side, you'll see that they're advertising shawarma plates.

When you go in, you'll see that they have menus all over the place. Starting from your left side, you'll see menus along the wall near the top wrapping all around the entire room. So they've definitely got a lot of food options.

It's a small shop, with the kitchen on the right, and a couple tables on the left.
Most people probably get it to go.

I came in for the burrito, but it looks like they offer a lot of other things as well.
The person making the burrito was pretty engaging, asking if you'd like everything on your burrito and whether you want it spicy or not.

The burrito itself is pretty good. It's a little different from the burritos you would get from somewhere like burrito boyz, but you get the usual toppings in it. It tasted sort of like a shawarma in a tortilla with the chicken they use.

Prices on the menu are inexpensive compared to other places downtown. I'd be interested in trying some of the other items such as the shawarma or the gyros."}
{"text":"I used to eat here every day when I worked around the corner, and never got bored. Their falafels are made different to many other joints in town, and they taste great. It's easily missed, but completely worth stopping in. 
Prices are good, and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"If you want to get some real fresh and tasty mediteranean food, go to Ali Baba's. Not only does this place have awful customer service, but they burn their meat to a point where you can't even eat it! 
Stay away!"}
{"text":"Located right next to Kanga, this place is a convenient grab and go hub for people working around Scotiabank Theatre. I can't really say much else for it than that, however.  I got the chicken burrito daily special for 5.99 dollars. The service was quick and efficient, similar to what you would find at Subways.  The level of sanitation was questionable for the rare areas that you could sit at if you're eating in, so that was a little off-putting.  Flavour was also non-existent in my burrito even though I had asked for all the fillings and there were only a few chicken pieces. I finished with the feeling of disappointment. If I had eaten a bowl of plain rice, I would have received a more impactful mouthful.  Beware: they only take debit and cash, and there's a 35 cent fee for using debit."}
{"text":"I have minimal experience of Egyptian cuisine.
My only encounter was an Egyptian Canadian Fusion....

MUMMY Dogs

Not sure what that is?
Ask the Pillsbury Doughboy.

Koshari($5.99) on the other hand wasn't Fusion but purebred Egyptian(?)
Appearance seems quite cultural diverse if you ask me.

Fried Onion - From German Spaetzle
Macaroni      - From Italian Pasta
Visually         - From Hong Kong Salamander Baked Pasta

Spicy, carby, saucy, ricey, macarony.  Complete protein meal maybe(?)

Might not be perfectly cooked al dente(come on, its a take-out place), but provides Energy, Blood Sugar & Serotonin.  
Other words, it'll keep you happy satisfied.   :D

Btw, It's NOT an Egyptian resto/store but just a take-out Burrito/Shawarma place with an Egyptian dish or two."}
{"text":"I decided to indulge my inner-foodie last night with a trip downtown to try this place.

Unlike most of the places in the area, this place doesn't stand out and it can be easily missed. As others have mentioned the store actually goes by three different names and each name has a different sign. The inside feels welcoming but slightly cramped. It's not the type of place that encourages you to sit and eat but to me that wasn't a problem as I was planning to take out anyway.

The menu covers 3 out of 4 walls. On the positive side, for those unfamiliar with the cuisine they do list what's in each dish but it would have been nice to have it in a slightly more condensed form. I was greeted immediately and, seeing that I was perusing the menu (which is pretty easy to tell when it's spread out over the store), was encouraged to grab the server's attention when I was ready to order.

The Kosharti looked really appealing but after hearing others describe it as a tobasco tomato sauce, I decided against it and instead ordered one of their chicken shawarma pitas. The meat was fresh and all the vegetables were fresh and crispy. I did find the pita on the smallish side and either the hummus or tabuleh gave the whole pita a very grainy texture. 

All in all, for those who are lining up outside much music, this is a reasonable fast option."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not sure why I keep using Ritual (and other apps that allow you to pick up your food). I have literally never had a seamless experience in terms of ordering and then quickly picking up my food.

This time around, I ordered a Chicken Shawarma Wrap and arrived at Baba Geddo about 10 minutes later. As soon as I walked in, the man preparing the food asked if I was picking up and I said yes. I was handed what looked like an unusually large package for a wrap and I headed outside to begin eating. Just as I was about to open the container, however, the checkout lady came outside and said I had the wrong order.

Fine, so I walked back inside and the aforementioned man began preparing my wrap. He was almost finished when said lady mentioned that she had already prepared a wrap and that it was sitting there waiting to be picked up.

Sheesh.

Anyway, I took my correct order and began eating. It wasn't worth the hassle.

This is, without mincing words, a terrible chicken shawarma. First and foremost, it's extremely light on the actual chicken. I wish I had taken a picture, as certain bites had no chicken at all and the whole thing contained barely a thin layer of poultry. Those crunchy bits that make shawarma delicious? Non-existent, of course.

A more accurate name for this thing would've been lettuce and tomato wrap, because that was pretty much all I could taste, while the sauces were so sparingly applied that they didn't make a dent.

If this is the calibre of the rest of Baba Geddo's offerings, it's a wonder that they're still in business. There are so, so many better options in the area, especially for shawarma."}
{"text":"I have passed this small little gem off Duncan street plenty of times but today I stopped and walked in...

The small halal middle eastern fast food shop was full of aromatic air and pictures displaying over abundance of items on the menu.

 While I was scoping out the pictures on the wall a humble kind voice behind the counter asked \"how may I serve you?\" There were 3 customers eating and 6 walked in behind me and my friend yet the semi elderly man behind the counter was hospitable as I had entered his house.

I opted for beef doner with salad rice, potatoes hummus and garlic sauce for $11.99. The beef was fresh, steamy, full of flavour, and luv. I took out my wallet to pay for it and the kind man said \"sit, enjoy your food, you can pay me after,\" and moved on to helping the line up of customers.

The food and service was outstanding at this little gem. With items like taco bowls, philly cheese steak, burritos, doner, falafel, tacos,shawarma, and vegan options of soy and meaty options of chicken, lamb, and beef I rate this place a Class Act just like the owner behind the counter"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly and fast service.  I lived  in the Middle East for a bit, and this really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Koshari ($5.99) ?? Egyptian National Dish? 

My first experience with Koshari at Baba Geddo was such a confusing experience.. 

Baba Geddo already made me confused..since this small takeout place really has 3 business names: Baba Geddo, Quick Pita and Mr. Burrito..... 

Koshari is one of the most popular, inexpensive dishes in Egypt.. the main ingredients are rice, brown lentils, chickpeas, a spicy garlicky tomato sauce (thinks Tabasco) and macaroni? Macaroni?? topped with fried onion as a garnish. 

After doing some search, I found out that Koshari is really a vegetarian/vegan dish and it is considered a meal that is inexpensive yet filling... oh now I know I was on another cheap date! :) 

BTW, the interior of Baba Geddo was really hot and stuffy on this particular summer afternoon... I felt like I am eating in Cairo... sunny and hot and stuffy! How more authentic can this experience be!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma.  It was really good. Not a traditional shawarma flavour but it was definitely delicious. 
The sauces were outstanding!
I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Taste for value lives here and the food is delicious. I come in for the $5.99 daily special burrito on a 12-inch tortilla. It's wholesome, fresh ingredients and almost doubled everything (their meat is cut kind of cut small) They dont drench it in sauce so be forwarned but I do implore to have some of their hot sauce. They're reasonably priced and have shawarma/falafel, Gyro/Donair , quesadillas/tacos plus koshari. I always leave happy, full and at peace, not overloaded. This place is very small with seating for 9."}
{"text":"One of the things I miss having moved from Toronto to Buffalo is my all-time favourite burrito joint, Baba Geddo.  Burritos aren't all that they serve, half of the menu is devoted to yummy Egyptian food.  It's the burritos, however, that keep me coming back.

What makes the burritos sooooo good?  Size and filling.  I always order the large cheese and bean burrito, medium spicy.  Whole wheat wrap to start with black beans, heaps of seasoned rice, shredded lettuce, generous scoops of guacamole, cilantro and salsa.  Toasted to perfection, the burrito is a powerhouse of taste, textures and spice.

In terms of Egyptian offerings, their red lentil soup is amazing.  Hearty, spicy, with a zingy lemon finish, it is a perfect winter pick me up.  The serving sizes are fairly small, but enough to satisfy.

Seating is limited, but it is fun to people watch from the window overlooking Duncan Street.  It is stiflingly hot in the restaurant during the summertime - it has an AC unit that appears to be for show only. Sit outside on the bench in front of the restaurant.

If you find yourself on Queen West anytime soon, give them the biz!"}
{"text":"This place create delicious yet inexpensive burritos. They are open till late in the night, which makes this place the ideal pit stop for late night adventures."}
