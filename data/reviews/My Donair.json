{"text":"I've been getting my donairs here for years and the same people behind the counter for years. It's a good meaty, fresh donair every time. Clean & friendly. Thanks!"}
{"text":"If you guys want awesome food and great service this is the place to go. There is a decent place to dine in but I mostly do take out but this place probably has the best Chicken Shavarma I have ever had in Calgary."}
{"text":"Used to be the best. I got three separate undetermined hard things in my deluxe donair. For sure use better quality meat people. The woman working there is very friendly, but the owners don't have a clue apparently."}
{"text":"Just had some donairs for supper and I must say they were quite delicious! 
My husband was wishing he had ordered the largest one, just to have some more! 
Meat is delicious, I had mine with garlic sauce, incredibly tasty but wow my breath must stink now! ;) also had a Caesar salad which was plain but nice. I like Caesar salad anyway I can get it. 

Also ordered a cheese pizza for the kiddos, they enjoyed it quite a bit! Delivery to our hotel was quick, and they even brought us a 2L pop! 

Wish we had a place like this in our neck of the woods, great donair!!"}
{"text":"First and last time here.. Love donairs, and after spending $24.50 I used my debit and was charged .25 to use the machine.. When I asked the lady her reply was all my customers know.. Apparently I am not a customer as i was not aware of this... The lady was rude and unhelpful.. NEVER eat here!"}
{"text":"The first time I came in for a donair I was in a hurry and guess what?  I forgot my wallet!  Since they always build your donair for you before you pay I felt like a total idiot.  

Here's what has kept me coming back time and time and time again. 

The owner said \"Eat, Eat! Come back and pay me later!\"  I was in total shock.  He let me eat and have a drink and come back and pay him later.  Well i did.  I went straight home to grab my wallet came back and paid him.  

I've been eating there for a couple years now probably 2-3 times a month.  His trust and honesty makes me a total fan. The best part now is that once you become a regular they know your name and what you usually eat.  You don't even have to order anymore. They just make it up for you. (that is if you're like me and eat the same thing all the time)

Yes the place's decor is a little chic \"hole in the wall\" but I love it!  The donairs are the best I've ever had and I always compare the donairs i eat around the world to these ones and Rick and Mom's are still the best in my mind."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an east-coast style donair, this isn't the place. The donair meat has a weird taste and their donair sauce is so runny it doesn't have any taste left. I only took a couple bites and threw it out. Mind you, I have high expectations when it comes to donairs. The 2 stars are for their cleanliness. She even rinsed the top of my pop can before giving it to me; that's a first."}
{"text":"The Donair is 5 star all the way. But, yes this place needs some kind of makeover. I do peek behind the counter when I order here, and at least the place is clean. He usually has 5 spits going and appears to be always busy. I've always had eith 1 person in front of me or behind me when I get a donair here. This is a good sign as the meat is always fresh. This guy in a downtown location would make a killing during the day. The great thing about this place not being downtown is there always is easy parking."}
{"text":"Never EVER will I put my body through the digestive agony and emergy expulsion of digestive byproducts brought on by eating here. There was a boy no older than 12 manning the cash register while the lady prepping the food went directly from sweeping to making my donair without washing her hands. I should have taken this as my cue to go elsewhere for my lunch but I was too polite, hungry, and my debit transaction had already gone through. I know that it is the donair that has given me said food poisoning because my girlfriend and I have shared in the exact same meals all week (all prepared by me) and she feels 100% and well... I'm about 10 lbs lighter. If the reading of this review saves even one person from this digestive anguish I'll feel like at least this wasn't all in vain."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, tasty chicken shwarma, sauces are flavourful and service is fast - a little gem!"}
{"text":"When the train station was closed I sought shelter here. They welcomed me and gave me a sample of their delicious food. They showed me such generosity and such kindess and let me stay inside while I waited for a ride home.
Superlative customer service. They made me feel so welcome. The food is delicious and the staff are wonderful people."}
{"text":"the donairs here are OK, but don't even come near the awesomeness of Jimmy's A&A, which is the best in the city. The problem with My Donair lies in the meat, which is IMO cut too thick and has a spongy texture because the meat isn't ground fine enough (need to double grind it). also, they charge extra for hot sauce, pickles, etc. which is pretty lame IMO.

the young man who is always working and who I think owns the place is quite nice, though. he always makes conversation with me, which is nice. even if they aren't the best donairs, i like supporting the place cause the guy is so nice."}
{"text":"Best donair in the city. Super clean, very friendly staff, good portions.

I loved the super and the jumbo ( something so big it's better to share...). The meat was so tender and juicy.  The owner makes an amazing hot sauce that is a MUST. Loved the ingredients, fresh cabbage, pickles and tomato. They have a great sweet sauce as well as garlic spread!
Too bad it's not closer to where we live, I would eat there every week for sure!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Let's put this out there: there is NO great shawarma/donair in this city. There, I said it. No ifs, buts or maybe. There is none, period.

That being said, My Donair is quite good. The meat is juicy and flavourful, they give you an option of 4-5 sauces, and the donairs come in various sizes. The prices are surprisingly affordable. Especially if you're going with 2 other friends because they have a 'Buy 2, get the 3rd free' option. If you do this, each shawarma works out to roughly 5-6 bucks! REALLY good deal. The owner is also very friendly.

As a girl who's pretty much lived on shawarmas and donairs during university, I'd love to give this place some suggestions:
- A bit more stuffing in the sandwich would be good.
- Maybe make your garlic sauce a tad bit more garlicky. 
- Toast / grill your donair after you've made them, and THEN give it to the customer.

Other than that, this is a really good  find if you're in the area and craving some donair!"}
{"text":"Superb...by far the best \"My Donair\" in the city! One would think there should be consistency between various locations, but this is not the case. This location stands-out from the rest...highly recommended, and the owners are very friendly.
They even gave us a large bottle of their homemade hot-sauce to take home, and my wife (who is originally from Mexico City) returned the favour on our next visit, bringing them some of her homemeade pico de gallo."}
{"text":"One of the best donairs you can find anywhere in Calgary , service is always good! Lots of options on size of donair as well"}
{"text":"My preferred go-to spot for quick Donair and Shawarma fix in south Calgary. Their meats are juicy and the odour permeates the moment you enter the store. For $10 I always get the beef and chicken combo with everything in it, including the myriad bevy of sauces My Donair offers: garlic, tzatziki, hot sauce, and the mysterious sweet sauce.

My only disappointment is that in my last visit, they no longer sold my beloved Stewart's Key Lime Soda, which complimented the fatty sauce derived from the Donair/Shawarma fantastically."}
{"text":"Yuck  gross donairs worst meat ever really put kraft singles on my donair??  garbage best donair place is in red deer at cleopatras!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first visit here.  Donairs were really tasty and the staff were very pleasant. We will definitely eat from here again"}
{"text":"I use to love this place I would drive from NW just to get there Donair Meat, But last time I went it was awful.. I think they changed I wish they'd bring the old meat back..!!"}
{"text":"No frills streetmeat shop. Check em out, good value."}
{"text":"For some reason this is the best location of the My Donair of the ones I've tried.  The staff are great and always pack the pita until it almost explodes.  You definitly get your moneies worth here."}
{"text":"The only reason I go to Westbrook mall is for this place. I always get the donair here and it's delicious! The owners are both super friendly and kind. Don't know why it doesn't get more love."}
{"text":"I think I might have a new lunch spot for my time here in Calgary. Donner kebabs are a world-wide staple and you may be more familiar with them in Greek restaurants. It's that spinning slab of meat that they slice and then serve on a warmed pita bread with assorted veggies and a sauce of some sort. I've had them in the UK, in Germany, in Switzerland and even in the Netherlands. It's a classic.

Here in Canada, it's exactly the same and \"My Donair\" has a pretty solid system. In addition to beef, they also offer a chicken and a veggie. Veggies include tomatoes, cucumbers, pickles, hot peppers and a few more. Top your donner with garlic sauce, tzatziki or hot sauce.

Wrapped in paper, you're going to need a few napkins. And feel free to eat in or take it to go. $7 for a regular with a can of soda. That's a pretty good deal and I think way better than the Subway three doors down."}
{"text":"Owner was super friendly and portions were huge.  My donair had tender, flavorful meat, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions and sweet garlic sauce with mozzarella.     Sooooo good.  Had to eat half of it before I took a pic.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I find the husband and wife team that work here very gracious and hard working, although the food and prices are very good, I just find that the whole place needs a makeover.  I find it a bit cheap and tawdry, they can use a good floor cleaning and the plastic flowers and out of date computer in the corner are far from appealing.

However if you do want delicious Donair options they do have 5 rotisseries here with I presume different meats at every portal plus the baklava is delicious at under $1.25."}
{"text":"This is place was awful. Overpriced not a real shwarma more like tasteless chicken in a piece of pitA with too much said and soggy vegetables. No turnips or parsley or any choices. terrible. Would never go here again. Doesn't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"Some things in life should be left up to the imagination and not questioned. Things like \"What exactly is sweet sauce?\" or \"How do they make the donair meat?\". I'm sure a quick googling would easily answer these questions, this isn't the Caramilk secret after all. But why ruin a perfectly good fantasy.

What shouldn't be left to the imagination is why the employees ask \"Do you want sweet sauce?\". What savages live in this world that deny sweet sauce on their delicious donair? Who are these people? I say show yourselves!

I don't come here as often as I would like to due to the lack of parking. If you come at peak lunch rush you're not going to find a spot. Maybe try parking across the street at the A&W. Every time I do come here though it's a consistently good donair. These guys have been around for decades. They know what they're doing. You can easily still get lunch here for under $10.

What more can you ask for? Well...more sweet sauce please."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that everyone loves a good beef donair.  It's that tender beef, mixed with the sweet sauce that makes this mouth-watering wrap a favourite of mine.

So, sure, when I'm driving down Macleod at 6 in the evening and pass My Donair, I'm going to stop in.  The food was definitely satisfying and filled the void in my belly.  I especially loved how much of that yummy white sauce they loaded onto my donair (a puddle actually filled at the bottom of the wrapping).  My Donair totally hits the spot come dinner time.

My only complaint about this place was the way my donair was prepared.  When I first walked in, the two workers (who I assume were husband and wife) weren't busy so were watching TV and doing some computer stuff.  When they man got up to help me with my order, I'm not so sure he sanitized his hands, and he wasn't wearing gloves.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, since the rest of the establishment seemed very sanitary.

It was delicious, and cheap, so makes it good in my books.  I'll probably stop in next time I'm hungry and driving down Macleod!"}
{"text":"If you want great donairs, amazing service this is it. The people who run the place are so warm and inviting like a proper mom and dad! The value is also really great the amount of foot for the price. Also the sweets are really good."}
