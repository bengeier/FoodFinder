{"text":"This was our first visit we had a groupon.  We ordered the crunchy tuna roll it was delish!  Our entrees was the Pad Thai with tofu and Pineapple chicken in spicy mango sauce.   Both was good but next time we will request extra spicy.  Even though the menu states spicy it lack it. .  Nice Interior and service."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The sashimi is excellent, as are the rolls, as is the katsu!  I lived in Japan for 4 years and was excited to see some dishes I haven't eaten in awhile, such as agedashi tofu and okonomiyaki.  Both are wonderfully done.  My husband loves the okonomiyaki, which he tried for the first time.  Needless to say, this is our favorite date night destination."}
{"text":"Great sushi. My husband and I thouroughly enjoyed everything that we ordered. I would highly recommend this place! Best Toro ever had. If your looking for a place to have a good bite of sushi....come here!"}
{"text":"My app was the charbroiled yellowtail cheek with ponzu sauce and the taste and texture was ethereal!  My main was the grilled eel served over rice. It doesn't look like a lit but i tell you that it is. The tender unagi was perfectly grilled and sasond."}
{"text":"We have tried this place twice. First time the service sucked!! What should have been a 30 min lunch (on a weekend and not during rush hour) took almost an hour and a half. The second time the waiter completely forgot about us and never even came around to take our order after we received our drinks. However he tended to others around us. REALLY?!? It was absurd. After waiting 30 mins and still no service we walked out. We had decided to give it a second try but they FAILED!!!"}
{"text":"I first visited Roppongi less than a week ago and have since been back twice for more! My initial thought was that they would have some competition from other Asian-inspired restaurants close by, but they are significantly different. They are advertised as a sushi restaurant and bar and that is exactly what they are as the menu is mostly sushi or sushi-like fare, but there are still some menu items that would tempt the tastebuds of those not looking for sushi as their meal. I haven't tried everything yet, but my favorites so far are the Tuna Tartar (tuna, tempura bits, avocado,mango, yuzu) appetizer, the Passion Roll (snow crab salad, topped with red and white tuna and eel, with dipping sauce) and the Roppongi Roll (deep fried lobster, asparagus, cream cheese topped with avocado, crispy taro masago and chef's specail sauce).  Everything that I have tried is great though...in taste and presentation! The service and staff were both outstanding! If you ever went into this place before it was remodeled and redecorated for Roppongi, you wouldn't recognize it! It has a very urban/chic/contemporary feel, while still feeling warm and inviting. It is well-suited for an intimate dinner for two or for a larger party ready for a night out! I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times already in two months! The food is great and the staff is great. There's plenty to choose from on the menu which is a big plus for me because I like variety. The ginger dressing on their side salad is to die for and the sushi is yummy.   All their servers are splendid but I always end up requesting Khoun. He's very knowledgable and does his job well.   Overall, Roppongi is a very tasty sushi restaurant. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"On a Monday evening I was the only customer so I got lots of attention and the food was quick and delicious.  Will go back when in town."}
{"text":"This place is great! First it is beautiful inside. Second the staff is great. And last the food is amazing! It takes so fresh and  just perfect. Not too salty like some Sushi places. And the prices are so reasonable. This is my new favorite place and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My first dining experience was the first week Roppongi opened back in April.  I wasn't sure what to expect from this refurbished past Friendly's restaurant.  When you walk inside there is a pleasant surprise awaiting.  A nicely lit, uniquely decorated, and super clean bar and restaurant.  Then for the menu and food...  I was offered a complimentary edamame and then dined from the lunch menu.  Two rolls with a salad for $9. The amount of food and quality far exceeded the price in my mind.  On my second visit tried the fantastic roll...think sushi's version of surf and turf.  Lobster and filet in one delicious combination.  In my opinion if you are going to open a restaurant....decide exactly who you are and do it well.  This it what Roppongi has done by offering a wide variety of fully cooked rolls and excellent fresh Sushi options.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials and most importantly good sushi.  For the money, it is very good, not the best, but again, for the money a very reasonable sushi choice.    Staff is friendly and fast.    Sushi is fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I'm here now for the 4th time. When I leave I'm immediately ready to go back. The passion roll is my favorite. The tuna tartar is incredible. The atmosphere is fun and welcoming and the staff always have smiles on their faces. Hands down the best sushi restaurant in North Mecklenburg!"}
{"text":"Roppongi is good, but not consistent. My husband and I have been here multiple times and ordered some of the same things, but it's never EXACTLY how we had it before. We ordered the Mongolian beef one week and it was delicious, and we went back the next week and the meat didn't taste like beef at all. It was rubbery and had a bad taste; same with the crispy shrimp we ordered. It was rubbery and gross one time we got it, and even the waitress said she'd never seen it cooked like that before.  Another complaint I have is the wait time. Every time I've been it's NEVER crowded, but the wait for my food has been considerably long at times. We waited over an hour one time just with an order of 4 sushi rolls at my table. Sushi is NOT that hard to make.  Lastly, some fill-in \"manager\" that's there apparently on Mondays has poor customer service. I think she may be the wife of one of the managers, but she does not know anything about the menu and the prices. For instance, Roppongi has a special of buy one get one sushi half off on Monday-Thursdays, and she tried to charge us full price for both of our sushi rolls, even after we told her we come to Roppongi all the time and its never NOT been BOGO 1/2 off. Ultimately she realized we were correct, but did not seem to care about the trouble we went through to get the price adjustment.  Overall, the food is pretty good, the service is just poor at times."}
{"text":"Sushi in Huntersville... Just seems like there are a bunch to pick from. I have not tried all of them but a few. I found Roppongi threw a coworker. Every now and then you need to have sushi, just that way. Roppongi is a great deal. I have only ever done take out because I can get 2 rolls for under $8.00. Is it the best I have ever had, No. But for the money it is really really good. I'm sure if I ordered more $$ rolls they would be really good. If I lived up here I would have not issue going there for dinner. From my quick stop in the staff seems very friendly. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and the service was wonderful. The sashimi was very fresh, and I love the varieties of rolls and how tasty they are. My favorite was the Hurricane roll and the Tuna Dragon Ball.  Definitely deserve repeated visits."}
{"text":"Driving up I-77, saw the sign for Roppongi....and never new the restaurant was so close to my shopping area.  So had to order some sushi and habachi dishes to see how good.  Ordered a few rolls.  They were all good.  A little small...but stil pretty good.  The shrimp and rice dish was very good.  Nice giant shrimp and rice fried very well.  The location is fairly easy to get to off of the interstate or from the neighborhood.  Parking is great!  The ambience is very nice.  Looking forward to next trip to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had since I've been in North Carolina! Loved the atmosphere and the service was very personable. It is a hidden gem! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"After Daniel A stated that this was the best American sushi he had and he had experience with true Japanese sushi, I was so excited. After all, my godfather actually lives in Roppongi and I've had sushi for breakfast at Tsukiji and \"dancing ebi\" prawns that were decapitated and gutted from tank to plate in 12 seconds. (shudder) So I had high hopes for Roppongi.   The interior is very distinctive with tall, padded upright red booths.    The food was really mediocre. Perhaps we should have just stuck with more traditional sashimi and nigiri but the table wanted rolls, so we got some rolls recommended here, so we got the passion, dragon and Fantastic Roll. The dragon was pretty good, but a little unmemorable.  The Fantastic was totally bland and tasteless. The lobster was a waste, so just get one with tempura shrimp and save your money.  We would not order that again. One person in the party had chicken teriyaki and it was ok.  The presentation was lovely, but if I wanted lovely bland sushi, I'd go to Enso. Boom!  We were also surprised that the restaurant was so empty on a Sunday evening.  We were greeted by a really nice guy who sat us and knew about Roppongi. I was sad when he was replaced by an annoyingly over-zealous waitress who wouldn't seem to leave us alone and didn't take a hint when she asked \"How did you like your food\" and we said it was \"good\" but this one roll was awful. She responded \"I'm so glad you liked everything! Huh? We knew she was trying to be helpful and positive but our guests were just as annoyed as we were. We felt very rushed and finally after we paid we sat in the booth for another 40 or so minutes having the dinner conversation we wanted to in the first place. I know she was trying to be helpful but it was just awkward.  Bottom line: I would go back and try sashimi / nigiri but only if I was in the area and the waitress was nowhere to be seen- it's not worth the drive from South Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say it, but this is not the place to go if you're looking for hibachi.  We were fooled by the advertisement of \"hibachi style\" food and assumed we'd be seated at a grill with a hibachi chef.  There are no hibachi grills at this restaurant.  We ordered the \"hibachi style\" entree anyway, and it just wasn't as good as regular hibachi.  It was kind of like ordering just plain teriyaki chicken with fried rice.  I don't know, it just wasn't quite right.  You also only receive a salad with the entree, rather than the standard soup and salad at other local restaurants.  It wasn't bad, just not what we were looking for.  If we lived nearby, we might try the sushi.  But we don't, so we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"6 weeks ago, we dined at Roppongi, and it was incredible. Probably the best sushi we've ever eaten. So I was excited to go back. And we did, to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were excited. However when we got there, the door was closed and locked....not a good sign. The hostess ran over and unlocked it, ok, maybe it was just an oversight. We were clearly the first people there, at 6:30. We were seated and given different looking menus, not the same ones we ordered off of 6 weeks ago. We proceeded with our orders. When the food arrived, it clearly looked different. This looked more like grocery store sushi, not fine dining. The portions were noticeably smaller and the sad part is that it didn't taste much better than grocery store sushi. I asked the server about what was different, and why the serving sizes were different and she said, it's because of the new menu. I spoke with a manager, and I told him that the sushi went from being the best around to the worst and asked what happened. All he could tell me was that people in the area didn't eat sushi, so they had to cut corners, and made excuse after excuse. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The Singapore rice noodles are fantastic.  Please go to Roppongi !"}
{"text":"Restaurant is CLOSED.  Was going to have dinner here but found a \"for sale\" sign on the door.  If you're close I'd recommend Yoshi's which is practically across the street."}
{"text":"Although the food and service were satisfactory, I would not go here again. The newly remodeled location is very nice. Our server was quite good as well."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd attempt to write this review on my experience here. Yelp filtered my original review but I want everyone to know how much I loved this place. So here is my original review that was posted on 9/28.  What a nice surprise to find such a great Japanese restaurant in Charlotte. The sashimi was extremely fresh, and I could tell that everything we ordered was prepared with a lot of care. They were well put together and tasted as great as they looked. The staff was attentive and very friendly. We ordered several appetizers and rolls to share but I wish we could've ordered more to try. The crazy sake roll was definitely my favorite of the day, with the fried calamari as a close second. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes Japanese food, they have a huge selection of food that will satisfy everyone's palette.   I look forward to coming back here the next time that I am in town!"}
{"text":"I had to try Roppongi based on the Yelp reviews!!!!  They did a Living Social a few months back and we passed on it.  Why?  Their location sucks!    I am a rock star!  I walked in for lunch and the server recognized me from my multiple forays to Rusans's Sushi in Charlotte.  He is a regular at Rusans's!  I thought so far, so good....  Then the owner comes to my table, he recognized me from a sushi joint that he used to roll sushi at over in the Kannapolis area.    Okay small world, and I am thinking, well this is getting better and better.  I had the 3 Maki roll lunch special.  The spicy crab, the peanut-avo and the eel avo rolls.  All were of excellent quality.  Generous portions of meat and extra large chunk of avocado.  The spicy mayo was homemade with real Japanese Mayo, mmm mmm.    I would rate these 8 or 9.  The peanut-avo roll was different and the peanuts / avo compliment eachother pretty awesome, giving a unique flavor.  The restaurant is ultra clean and very tastefully decorated.  I look forward to going back with my wife for a full blown meal."}
{"text":"Awesome Sushi addition to the area.  Huge upgrade from the horrible Friendly's that used to be here.  Great renovation job inside shows no signs of the old Friendly's decor.  Very cool vibe.  Sushi selection is very impressive and will satisfy casual to hardcore sushi fans.    I'll compare it to Eez Fusion, as it's just a couple miles down the road and is of a comparable quality.  They have the big fancy rolls that people are used to Eez.  Really well put together stuff, with high quality fish.  They also hit all the basic rolls, nigiri, sashimi, etc.    The menu is way less contrived than Eez, which is nice.  It's not trying to be a Sushi/Hibachi/Mongolian/Thai place.  It's just trying to serve good sushi.    Family friendly as well.  Nice kids choices.  Our kids got the kids california rolls, cut to smaller pieces.  It came with fries and even a scoop of ice cream.  Good ice cream, not the cheap stuff.  If you're looking to avoid the crowds at Birkdale and Eez, this is well worth heading one exit south to Gilead Rd.    Also, had a nice looking bar area with several flat screens and soon to be getting Sapporo on tap."}
{"text":"This used to be a great authentic Japanese restaurant, but since they chanced owners,  it's become the same nasty homogenized \"Asian fusion\" dishes ( which is code for we can't actually cook any Asian cuisine correctly,  so we just throw it all together and hope for the best), and the sushi is inedible and overpriced. Btw, \" hibachi\" is not something you find at a real Japanese restaurant. That is a dead giveaway you're in for a stomach ache."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Food was decent... not the best sushi, but love the fact that it's BOGO. Don't know of any other place in Charlotte that has BOGO. The only thing we weren't thrilled about was that we ordered 4 different rolls for variety, but were then told that the Roppongi roll and another roll we chose were actually the same roll. Odd because the 2 rolls we got looked nothing like the Roppongi roll others have posed here on Yelp. In conclusion, customer service not up to par here, but sushi is decent for the price."}
{"text":"I have been to Roppongi three times now and I must say I am very happy with their offering. The service is good but what stands out to us are the appetizers which have been extremely tasty. I recommend to have a meal consisting of appetizers and skip the entrees."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, price a little high, service was Ok - but the Techno music must go!   We will stick with Coral Sushi near Birkdale."}
{"text":"Since I use yelp a lot to find decent places to eat when I am on the road, I felt obligated to create an account tonight to let people know this isn't the place to go. I went there for lunch (alone).  I was asked if I had ever dined with them before and my answer was an honest, no.  I thought I might have received decent service since the restaurant was practically empty.   There was 1 server-- I had to ask the person who sat me to submit my lunch order, I was without a drink for half the meal and had to request my check (completely ignored).  The sushi wasn't good either.  The seaweed was soggy so you had to really chew it to get it down and the wasabi was runny... just weird.   The bargain \"buy one get one free\" is a rip off because the price of a single crunchy roll was almost $13 with spicy tuna close to $8 (reasonable).     There- review #1 complete, now off to give some positive reviews...."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that all of the reviews posted on this place are accurate.  Food is incredible, staff is awesome, and the atmosphere is nice!  Definitely look forward to my next visit here!"}
{"text":"Try the fantastic roll. Lobster wrapped in filet mignon with chefs sauce for dipping. Awesome!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here probably 10 times and have never been disappointed. While some food may be better than others, isn't that true of every restaurant along with individual tastes? One of my fave items is the lobster explosion roll. Yum!! I even like the ice cream for dessert. My son doesn't eat sushi so he eats more traditional dishes and loves them. My husband loves the Mongolian beef. The house wine is pretty good too.  My concern is their location. It is a little hard to find as it is behind a gas station that is beside a shopping center. But it is definitely a hidden jewel in Huntersville and worth turning on the GPS to find."}
{"text":"The best sushi lunch in Charlotte (well, technically Huntersville). They offer a very similar deal to Pisces - all you can eat sushi that is freshly prepared (no buffet) in addition to kitchen specialties like spring rolls , noodles etc.   They do however differ in a few ways 1) The sushi is WAY bigger! They do not distinguish between lunch/dinner rolls in terms of size meaning way more tuna and much less rice and \"filler\" 2) They offer a much bigger variety to choose from on their lunch special menu. 3) Because they are using large pieces of expensive fish they are sticklers for their \"must it all\" rule or you pay full price for the roll. I ended up getting a little greedy and ordered four rolls (expecting them to be the same size as Pisces) well this was a lot for me to eat so order a little at a time and you should be just fine.  It was pretty empty but the restaurant itself is very nice & clean. The fish was very fresh tasting and overall I was impressed!"}
{"text":"So Roppongi has been a huge surprise to me! I was watching it under construction for some time because the name, being the name of a trendy neighborhood in Tokyo, really caught my eye. (They even stay true to the kanji characters on the sign!) I honestly wasn't expecting a whole lot - you know, the typical Chinese-run fusion sushi joint. I was sorely mistaken!  You walk into a very classy layout here. They have the color scheme and materials theme down pat. The restaurant is huge with seating for plenty, including a couple of nice Asian-style party rooms with pictures of Tokyo on the wall. They remind me of karaoke places in Japan. The huge bar combines both a standard bar and a sushi bar and faces off with three TVs.  On to the food, I was totally blown away! They had some excellent sushi combinations. The Fantastic Roll speaks for itself with deep fried lobster and mango topped with filet mignon slices and a tonkatsu dipping sauce. And if you couldn't already tell I like lobster, the Lobster Explosion Roll and Roppongi Roll go without saying. Think of it like replacing the shrimp tempura in most rolls with some sweet fried deliciousness.  On a side note, servers and chefs here are great and very service oriented. They stick to the classy theme and provide informative service despite the fact the restaurant just opened. I highly recommend going here! I've been back three times already!"}
{"text":"My friend and I got a livingsocial deal and thought why not but we didn't realize how far it was from Fort Mill! Aside from the long drive, the sushi was fresh and pretty good! I was surprisingly shocked at how elegant the decor was and how good the sushi was.  They have two large rooms for large groups and the decor in those rooms has a japanese vibe to it. They have pillows to sit on.    We got hot sake (large for $9-10) which was pretty small in my opinion. I think we both had a serving of 4 cups and it was gone. They also have cold sakes that come in various flavors and ranges from $12-16.   We got the love boat. The love boat was great because it really allows you to try out everything because it had all sorts of sashimi, rolls and special rolls. The fish was really fresh and the rolls were comparable to some ones in DC. I just hope their quality doesn't lack since I didn't see many costumers there when I went.   As for dessert, we got the volcano cake which was fried ice cream wrapped with funnel cake. They let you choose the ice cream flavor. We got green tea and it was great. The green tea ice cream wasn't too sweet but just enough to balance the sweetness from the funnel cake.   Overall this was a good sushi restaurant that I would regularly go to but it's just too far. I have to pass charlotte to get there and with all the restaurants in charlotte it's really hard to make the extra trip for this restaurant unless they do something spectacular."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced for the quality of their food. I think all Japanese restaurants in this areas are... No authenticity and no taste."}
{"text":"So, I've been to Roppongi three times now, and I think I've been enough times to say I'm not a fan.  I kept thinking I was missing something, because all of the other reviews are so positive.  And it's not BAD, but I've just had better sushi at a lower cost.  I must say that the decor is beautiful and very eye-catching.  You can tell they spent a lot of money converting this former Friendly's into something special.    Their service was generally good.  We dined in two of the three times.  I had better service sitting at the sushi bar by myself than with my hubby at a table.  Also, our server couldn't tell my hubby what kind of sushi was on his plate, and I would expect a server to be able to do this when working at a sushi restaurant!  We have tried several different appetizers, including the grilled beef negimaki that my hubby liked very much.  (I'm not a big fan of steak, so it didn't do much for me.)  We also tried the toko su octopus appetizer.  The pieces were huge and VERY chewy - I would not recommend that dish!  I also tried the shamai, which tasted like they were frozen and not made in-house.  The gyoza were better and tasted freshly made, but they were very small.  Onto the entrees...I've had the spicy salmon maki roll, shrimp tempura maki roll, lobster roll, and lobster explosion roll.  I liked the salmon roll - it had a lot of flavor.  Both lobster tempura rolls were topped with a sweet (hoisin?) sauce that I didn't much care for.  The shrimp roll didn't do much for me. The maki lobster roll was also quite chewy.  However, my hubby did enjoy his mixed sushi plate.    Overall, this place is just not for me.  Oh, well."}
{"text":"They must have changed ownership because it is not as good lately. Still okay, but I can get more for less without the drive to Huntersville."}
{"text":"The rolls, sashimi and sushi are the best I've had in the US!  Before I start with my review, let me provide you with some background on my previous sushi experience! My wife and I both lived in Japan for 6 years until 2011 when we moved to the US, and while there we ate sushi and sashimi at least once a week, and have had the freshest sushi from some of the best restaurants in Tokyo.   Thus far my time in the US (living in New York) has been a bit of a let down on the sushi front after our time in Japan, so when some trusted friends said we had to try Roppongi Sushi while we were visiting Huntersville, I was a little apprehensive. A quick check on Yelp was encouraging, as a few others appeared to be saying the same thing.  All I can say is that to date, Roppongi Sushi offered up the best rolls, sashimi and sushi I have had outside of Japan. The fish was firm, flavorful and fresh, the rice was actually proper Japanese (or Perl) rice (the backbone of all good sushi), and the creativity of the menu for the rolls was excellent. The staff friendly, courteous and attentive, and the restaurant decor a mixed Asian / American fusion style with individual booths for intimacy, and an open area with bar seating if you want to watch the sushi chef at work!  Overall an exceptional experience, and all for a very reasonable price. Well worth a visit - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Monday, buy one roll get second HALF off.  This place is the unsung hero of Huntersville.  Outstanding Roll was awesome! GET THE ROPPONGI ROLL NOW!  Seriously ...less than 25 bucks for two 8 piece rolls and that is perfect for two people. 2.50 Sapporo drafts as well! HOLLA!!!  GREAT PLACE! Thank you so much Angel!!"}
{"text":"We ended up here because we couldn't get in at Eez, lucky us!   This place was fantastic.    Roppongi roll is must.  Our new favorite sushi spot in charlotte.  If you're thinking about trying this place, definitely do."}
{"text":"cant really review.  came here for sushi, but the place is closed and locked up with for sale signs."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very empty for a Friday night. They were very understaffed but our server was good considering. The sushi rolls sounded great on the menu but were a big disappointment. Very blah and boring. They gave us no reason to come back and try again."}
{"text":"A simply MUST GO!!!  Like: quality of food, freshness of sashimi, creative sushi rolls, extensive menu, yummy cocktails, friendly & attentive services, clean & spacious setting, private room, very reasonable price.   Dislike: nothing really.   I wish Roppongi Sushi & Bar is located in NYC! Having lived in Japan for 6 years, I am pretty spoiled when it comes to fresh seafood, especially sushi and sashimi, so I was very surprised when my friends took me to Roppongi Sushi & Bar, I wouldn't have dreamed of finding a great Japanese restaurant in Charlotte.   We were a group of 8, so we decided to order lots of different rolls, appetizers and dishes to share. We also ordered a Sashimi plat to share, OMG, the freshness of fish was just amazing.  I honestly don't remember the name of dishes we ordered, but what I remember was that every dish was YUMMY.   Another must try is the different flavors of Martini, this time I only had chocolate martini, I wish I am not a light drinker, cuz I so wanted to try the peach martini as well.   I definitely come back again when I gonna visit NC later this year!!!"}
{"text":"BOMB.  Sushi in the middle of butt-f**ked North Carolina you ask? Yep. And it was good. .   I don't even know if I've had Japanese food this fresh in CA.   The fish was fresh, the lunch special was kind of stupid for how cheap it was. Everyone was really full and very happy when we left.  The server was kind of a dingaling. She couldn't answer a lot of questions we had and when I asked her if she knew if there was a changing table in the ladies room she said no, but that I could change my kid on top of where the sinks are.  There is actually a changing table and there is no room to change your kid where the sinks are. Homegirl definitely does not have kids cause she was way misinformed.  I would definitely eat here again when we come visit North Carolina. So good!"}
{"text":"The quality here seems to have gone down hill quite a bit in the last year. We ate dinner here recently on a Saturday night and our tempura appetizer was cold. After sending it back, it was obvious that they just threw the cold tempura back in the fryer and gave it back to us because it was all greasy and falling apart.   Aside from the disgusting tempura, the rest of the meal was a huge disappointment (our standards had been set pretty high because we've had very good meals here in the past). Rubbery crab meat in our other appetizer and chewy not-fresh-tasting salmon in the sushi rolls.   Seems like there are some serious issues going on in the kitchen. We will never eat here again, and judging by how empty it was on a Saturday night I don't think we're the only ones who feel that way."}
{"text":"Went to check out Roppongi after finding a sweet Groupon-esque deal online. We're big sushi fans and like to try tons of different places, but still have our favorites. While Roppongi didn't upset our top two it definitely squeezed it's way into our number three spot.  Roppongi is a huge restaurant, and it was pretty quiet when we went on a Saturday night. The menu is pretty expansive and does a combination of sushi, hibachi and other stuff. For an appetizer we went with the Flaming Avocado ($10). I think the best way to describe it is guacamole with an Asian flare. You get half an avocado that is hollowed out and then filled with mashed avocado, tuna, and salmon. It has a bit of a spicy kick to it thanks to some wasabi mayo and is served with some wonton chips to dip with. It was a different appetizer but I really liked the combo of the avocado with the cooked fish...almost like a crab dip. Definitely worth checking out as an appetizer.  For dinner we ordered a Roppongi Roll ($16) and Fantastic Roll ($18.) The Roppongi Roll had deep fried lobster, asparagus and cream cheese all rolled up with some other stuff, making for a tasty roll. Call us monsters but we enjoy what cream cheese brings to sushi, so we really dug it. The deep fried lobster brings a somewhat sinful experience to the roll, and the price helps in that respect too.  Speaking of sinful, the Fantastic Roll is even pricier but adds cooked ribeye steak to the fried lobster equation. The fried lobster is rolled up with mango and the roll is topped with slices of decadently seared ribeye steak. I love ribeye steak but I was not a fan of this particular combination. I preferred the Roppongi Roll in the end.  Roppongi is a solid sushi joint, but there are couple of better places in the Lake Norman area. Roppongi is a bit on the pricey side, and the food quality is not exactly better than other places to warrant the price, but the sushi is still very tasty."}
