{"text":"I've had the po' boy and the steak sandwich and both were great. Would give it a 5 if they provided a side! Really nice guys, I'll be going back"}
{"text":"Wow! This is one fantastic sandwich. Takes a little bit of time but well worth it.   I have had the steak sandwich, the breakfast sandwich and the meatball sub. Each one was made to order and and was perfect!"}
{"text":"In an area that's saturated with 'fast food' chain sandwich joints, it's nice to have an option like Dr. Augusta's.  I went with the chicken sandwich, and everything was fresh. Fresh sourdough bread, tender poached chicken, sweet sauce, crisp toppings.  The sandwich and a cream soda came up to $13. The cream soda was OK. It wasn't harsh on the way down, meaning it was better than any of the crap you get out of a drink machine. I wanted the root beer but it was sold out.  A welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Veggie wrap ( just under $10) is fresh and light. Loved the toasted non-greasy roti. Clean spot, friendly staff, fast service, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Recently received a buytopia voucher as a gift for this establishment. Went in not really knowing what to expect. However, I was blown away by the freshness, the quality of the ingredients as well as by the professionalism, passion and kindness of the owners. I had the shrimp po'boy and was floored by how good this sandwich was. The coating on the shrimp was not heavy, the bread was light, soft and delectable, the Marie-Rose sauce sweet yet tangy and the orange fennel salad a refreshing and sweet contrast to the saltiness of the breaded crustaceans. And the homemade old-fashioned sodas..... what a treat and way less sugary! Move over A & W, there is a new Root Beer in town! With their seltzer water and house syrups, these guys revive the noble craft of the Soda Jerk. Less sugar,way more flavour. Overall, a great and different option in Kensington. I will return to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Had the vegetable wrap which was a dahl roti with some veggies, panisse and a beautiful champagne sauce....  The Kale slaw was AMAZING I would recommend it again.  Didn't seem very packed, very good place to eat before doing your market shopping."}
{"text":"While I haven't yet visited for lunch, going by the $2 mini beef slider I got during their pedestrian Sunday offering, Augusta's Samitorium appeals to me and makes me want to go back. Tasty beef cooked just right so it has perfect texture in spite of the small size that can turn to a crispy rock easily on the grill. A nice soft bun, and the best part, home made style corn niblet relish! That stuff is the best. The prices seem quite reasonable too."}
{"text":"I live in Kensington Market, and this is the take out place I frequent the most (which is saying something considering how good the take out options are in The Market).   Every single thing on their menu is amazing. The sandwiches, the salads, it doesn't matter what it is, these guys know what they're doing. Also, I'm not a big soda guy, but I always get a soda from here. They have a robust flavour, unlike the processed/mass produced flavours normal canned pop has. They are also not as sweet, which is nice. My favourite is the ginger ale for sure, because it gives a bit of a bite.  To boot, the two guys who run the place are standup gentlemen, so I feel good about spending my money there."}
{"text":"These guys are making some really good sandwiches at some decent prices. I'm not going to lie, I have really been too much lately since Sanagans opened their sandwich counter as they're amazing and the price is better but that being said I have enjoyed everything I've had at Samitoriums and I've tried all the regular sandwiches on the menu"}
