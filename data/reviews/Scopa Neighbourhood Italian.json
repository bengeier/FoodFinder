{"text":"Great unassuming place for very good italian food. Ordered the chicken parm and they ince again did a great job in the kitchen. Chicken was cooked to pretty much perfection, juicy on inside and nice layer of crisp on the cheese on top. I ordered the double pasta instead of the Kale and glad that they accomodate. One of my favorite italian places in Calgary. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, but something just did not click.  I ordered the Pork Tenderloin with Potato Gnocci as main, and while it was cooked decently enough (moist with a nice sear), there has to be something said about the passion of the food.  Maybe it's a curse because I've dined around too much, but overall, the food just ended up tasting uninspiring.  Even as I looked at the menu, I felt like leaving since nothing jumped out at me.    I don't want to knock on it too much because the food is decent.  And it's very understandable from a business point of view to just play it safe and do what works. But it's honestly something you can make at home without too much effort.  When you dine, you go for an experience.  That experience shouldn't be I remember eating this last week at home.   It should be memorable and original and unfortunately it wasn't.  Come to think of it, that may also explain my apathy towards their other affiliated restaurants - Cibo, Posto and Bonterra.  While technically good, it's just more of the same and it's not ultimately adding to a greater palate."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a cute local italian dinner. Calamari, pizza & spaghetti carbonara was great. Lasagne is ok, nothing special. The reason this gets 3 stars is I had the pasta with meatballs and became violently ill by the time I reached home. They brought me the wrong order. They originally brought me the spaghetti. They were very nice, let us keep the spaghetti and said my pasta with meatballs would be out soon. To my surprise it came out within 5 minutes. Unfortunately by the time I reached home I was throwing up into the evening. I don't know if they didn't cook the meat properly but this was my first time having any food poisoning and definitely my last visit to Scopa."}
{"text":"What is wrong with people? This is not good Italian, my brother and I came here after all the positive reviews with high expectations and we were let down. I got the pizza the sauce was chunky and the cheese was mediocre at best. The service and ambiance were nice but the food was a huge disappointment.  If you're looking for a cool place to get a few drinks then fine but do not come here expecting good Italian food. PS my brother and our friend echoed my thoughts on the quality and taste of the food."}
{"text":"We were each give a slice of focaccia type bread, to dip in some great balsamic vinegar. The bread was cold. (Warm bread would have been a nice touch). My friend ordered the spaghetti carbonara and that was quite good, though the portion was small. I ordered a pizza. It is a good sized pie, but the taste was very disappointing. It was described as a pear and chicken pizza with carmelized fennel. Disappointing not to taste the sweetness of pear in this, though there are good chunks of chicken here. It was also extremely greasy. They do have a nice patio if you like your patios."}
{"text":"It was our first time at this VERY FRIENDLY Italian restauranr..Their staff is awesome  Nice ambience, a little bit noisy but you can still have a good chat! I tried Arancini and Mushrooms Rice,very good! Great end with Tiramisu!! For sure we'll come back soon! Recommend, to try!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to check out Scopa as I love their other restaurants - Bonterra, Cibo etc.   The restaurant is very cozy, with a Restoration Hardware feel.   The wine list is not large but a good enough selection.  The staff is very friendly, the Chef came out to talk to us as well as the owner.  Now on to the food.   Amazing.  Best carbonara I have had.  Not too creamy, pasta done perfectly coupled with amazing flavours, texture and a good size portion.  I am craving it right now.  Hubby ordered Pizza which was delicious as well.  The ubiquitous Tiramisu?  This is the best I have had - light and fluffy, must be the addition of the Marsala Zabaglione. Don't let the outside of the building scare you, they have exciting plans for an outdoor patio.  We saw the renderings and it will be sophisticated.  Check it out - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great variety of delicious food and drinks, and a very cozy atmosphere! Would definitely come back to Scopa again and again."}
{"text":"After glowing recommendations from friends, I finally had the opportunity to check out Scopa.   Surprisingly on a gorgeous Friday evening, the patio was relatively empty. It was a perfect setting for a dinner all'aperto with candle light, lanterns and heater lamps once the night began to cool off.  Although I wanted the creamy gnocchi, seafood risotto and the carbonara, ultimately (and realistically) I knew I had to choose. I went with my first love of bacon, which the carbonara had a wild boar version of.  No regrets on my choice, the creaminess of the egg mixed with bacon, chillies, white wine and grana padano made the dish rich and delectable.  Considering I already made a mental list of things I still need to try at Scopa, there's no doubt I'll be back again to check off (and probably add!) items on my list!"}
{"text":"I went to Scopa for the second time last night and it is amazing. The first time I went I was kind of surprised by the atmosphere. I'm not sure what I expected but I was pleasantly surprised by the rustic and homey feel inside.  The first time I had the ceci bruschetta and I had again the second time because it is so tasty. The entrees were the cannelloni and the tagliatelle, both are delicious. I loved the cannelloni, it has amazing flavours and was just an excellent pasta dish. The tagliatelle had a bit of a kick to it, some pepper, not sure which, gave it some heat which was very nice. My mom had the lasagna at first last night but it was unfortunately overly salted, but I'm still giving them a five star rating so you can tell that was not a big deal, a little disappointing sure, but not a damper on the evening. She switched over to the butternut squash risotto, which we had tried the first time, and it is so good. Our guest for the evening had the maiale with gnocci, carrot and hazelnut, minus the hazelnut due to an allergy. She loved it, said the meat was cooked perfectly and the flavours were amazing. She would have liked more gnocci though. For dessert we had tiramisu and the torta cioccolota.....yummmmm. I love the torta, it is not too sweet or too chocolatey, it is light and delicious and the raspberry on top with pistachio and walnut is the perfect touch. I can't wait for the patio to open and enjoy the meal outside."}
{"text":"Neighborhood authentic italian never tasted as good as in this open kitchen located right next to Lina's Supermarket!  The cozy space looks huge with its soaring high ceiling loft, fire oven clearly visible from The entrance and fully stocked bar.   Fresh focaccia bread is brought to the table with a small plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar as well As a house-made oregano basil butter spread.  They only bring you a small slice of the bread even though the butter to spread on is to die for; knowing that we are about to indulge in amazing food without having to take a doggie bag home so don't load up on the bread!!! Read on why....  For my american friends reading this, they might find pasta and appetizer pricing and portions for a neighborhood joint \"overpriced and small\" however, for Canada, it is very standard as value is determined by taste and experience rather than quantity of food and low prices lol America is a lot about how low can you go, how much food can I get for how little lol   The Small cup of Minestrone soup ($7) was homemade goodness while calamari ($15) and shrimp appetizers ($16) were light and out of this world tasty, umm mm mm!  Since we are here, we decided to indulge and do a carb overload night by ordering pasta.  The small bowl of meatball tagliatelle ($23) was portioned just right, not too much and not too little; very small by american standards for sure.  It was very very very tasty, the sauce was truly made like my home and on a scale of 1 to 10, this dish is an 11!  The wild mushroom and ravioli ($23) was just as good and portioned sensibly.  Well since we weren't bloated at all with the sensible portions and tasty plates, we went all out, yet again, with the house made tiramisu ($9); so Glad we did! Dio Mio! This was the tiramisu I grew up on, no regrets whatsoever! I'm still thinking about it a day later!  Will definitely return for a hip taste of home, Mangia, Mangia!!!"}
{"text":"The bread was amazing!!! I had a pasta and it was good. I liked the atmosphere, with the red checkered tablecloths. The service was very very good, as well. Our waiter was able to give us lots of advice and was very friendly. I have recommended it to friends and I do plan to go back."}
{"text":"I tried the carbonara and risotto today for lunch.  Last time I was here was over a year ago but I remember their mushroom pizza and carbonara was great.  This time around, I was surprised that the carbonara was very salty and the onion and garlic was overpowering.  The risotto was also very salty.  I'm not sure if it was an off day or there's a new chef, but this was not to the same quality I remember a year ago.  Based off this experience, I likely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Had a dinner a Scopa and ended up with food poisoning! The waiter suggested Carbonara pasta and we went with it.  I found it overly salty and oily.  The pasta itself was overcooked. We also ordered their churcaterri board which we found overpriced (2 types of meat and 3 small pieces of cheese).  After having a dinner both my husband and I felt unwell and were violently sick the entire night. We did not eat anything after Scopa so there was no question what gave us the poisoning. Never return again!"}
{"text":"Overall had a very good first visit to Scopa! We came here to celebrate my dad's birthday on a Friday night and the place was packed. Didn't know they had a very roomy outdoor patio out front and I was sad that it wasn't warm enough to sit out there, but if I had known that patio existed I would have frequented it throughout the summer. First off, their complimentary focaccia bread to start your meal is to die for!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. For appies we tried the arancini and a couple of their different bruschetta options, the mushroom one being my favorite. For pastas we had the tagliatelle polpette, spaghetti alla carbonara and linguine con le vongole, the highlight being the carbonara. We also ordered the NY striploin to share between the 4 of us. The steak was probably my least favorite item we ordered, I've definitely had better steak elsewhere. The service was great, and I wish I could give a half star just to our waitress for putting up with my dad's lame jokes (LOL). When they heard it was his birthday, at the end of the meal they gave him a card signed by everyone which also included a 10% voucher for any one of their restaurants (which include Cibo, Bonterra, Posto, Parc Brasserie) so that was a nice touch. I would definitely come back to try some of their pizzas, and of course, more pasta! Don't know why people keep going to The Olive Garden when places like this exist =)"}
{"text":"Chef Boy Ardee is better. Yeesh, tied in with a good Italian Centre and they can't cook to save their lives.   The list of Italian dishes they can't execute is long. Coffee is good and drinks are ok.   If you love Italian like I do you will loath this joint.  My dog eats better than this and she's Irish."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service,  amazing food. ..what more can you ask for. Also,  I really appreciate the servers being well versed on their wine selection."}
{"text":"Fan bloody tastic.  Service was great, patio was comfortable and welcoming, and the food?  So good.  We had the gnocci, the tagilatelle, and a green salad to share.  All was balanced, cooked to perfection, and presented well.    The cannoli, while not traditional, was fabulous.  We were just going in for a quick pasta, and wound up with a great evening.  Well done!!"}
{"text":"Wednesdays. $5 cocktails. Sit at the bar, try a cocktail. Take your girlfriends with you. Chat with the super awesome bartender Tyler. Try more cocktails. Order some of the Grissini breadsticks. Pig out. Try all the remaining cocktails because they are all goddamn delicious. Make plans to return next Wednesday. Repeat.  Humpday blues = HANDLED."}
{"text":"We finally had a chance to get over to Scopa after always talking about trying it, but never getting around to it.  The space really has transformed, without being that drastic. It's a much better use of the space than the previous tenant. It's cozy without being to crammed in tightly.  We started with appetizers. First, the Polpette (beef meatballs) were large, succulent and tender. I particularly enjoyed the spicy little kick the sauce had. Next up was the arancini (risotto balls). These were larger than others I've had, crispy on the outside but overall a little boring. I've had better, I've had worse. I think I prefer the type with a little meat or cheese stuffed inside.  My main was beef & mushroom ravioli. The menu described the sauce as a chestnut cream. Chestnuts!? How original - yummy. That sounded scrumptious. Although, not noted on the menu, our server did mention to me that this dish has prosciutto sprinkled on top. That was fine by me but at this time I did advise the server that I can't eat much onion. 'Not a problem' she said. So imagine my surprise when I dug into the lovely creamy chestnut sauce only to taste a creamy onion sauce! I picked around a little thinking... no big deal, I can eat around a few onions. But they started piling up, amounting to at least a good half cup. Unfortunately, it completely overpowered any chestnut taste. When our server checked back, I mentioned my disappointment that despite advising her of my onion aversion this was in fact, an onion sauce. Her reply was.. \"well the chef didn't tell me\". There was no offer to make another, or order a new main - only to put blame on the kitchen. So sadly, after eating just 3 ravioli, which were very tender, containing generous amounts of beefy filling, I had to quit eating or risk having a belly ache. Luckily my table-mates were happy to sample the remaining. At my expense of course!  My friend ordered the lasagna. It was served in a little baking dish, very deep with a lot of meat sauce. I believe the pasta was fresh - which was a nice surprise. Very enjoyable but not enough cheese for me.  The dessert board was a marvel! Two of us decided to share it but it was massive. The board included a little of everything; mini pumpkin panna cotta, rum cake, chocolate ganache cake, tiramisu and cannoli. They all tasted delicious. I don't think I could pick just one. They were all stellar. Unless you are really hungry or have large appetites, I wouldn't recommend this as a dish for two.  We may give it another shot, especially on Tuesday  1/2 price wine bottle nights!"}
{"text":"Amazing menu and staff. Everyone is attentive and can read your needs perfectly! I highly recommend this Italian restaurant... the best in Calgary!"}
{"text":"My wife and I brought a friend from TO to Scopa this weekend. The service was terrific & the food was  good . We had bruschetta and Calamari as starters which was really tasty . The main courses were Risotto , ( which my wife said was good but not great ) Our friend had Lasagna which he said was really tasty . I had the Gluten free spaghetti with meatballs, that was tasty but not the best I ever had ."}
{"text":"You know what bums me out? When I go to a restaurant with friends in a city that's supposed to be savvy and hip... and get a sad salad while everyone else gets pizza.  This doesn't happen at Scopa. They don't have anything specifically vegan or GF on the menu, but just let any of the servers know and they'll treat you right. You won't be crying in to wilted iceberg lettuce drowning in raspberry hatred. You'll get delicious pasta tossed in a flavorful, homey sauce that makes you feel cozy and like swinging your legs under your bar stool with each bite.  Pull up a chair right on the bar with your ladies on a Wednesday night, and drink your fill of $5 cocktails. That's right. Cocktails: $5 on Wednesdays. And not from a \"special Wednesday only cocktail menu\" full of sadness and rotgut tequila. No, scrumtralescent mouth parties like their own take on a Mule, the Pera e Cannella (made with pear vodka), or my personal favorite: the Nouvo (Bulliet bourbon, Peperoncino liqueur, ginger and orange). Plus some classics, and a few besides... and maybe if you're awesome, Tyler the bartender will whip up something on the spot.   Lots to try out, so make sure you come back often to try all of it. Live the pizza life within budget! Besides Wednesdays, they have different specials for every day of the week, like 1/2 price wine on Tuesdays and Mimosas on Sunday. Remember! Sophia Loren owed her figure to Spaghetti ;)."}
{"text":"Great food and great service, I will totally visit this eatery again, not to mention the spectacular Italian grocery Lina's next door.  If you want great Italian food, go to this place."}
{"text":"Service was excellant and so was the food.   We sat at the top -  Great for adults.  The oven/stove was down so we had salads and wine but the service more than made up for it."}
{"text":"It's been said before, but I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't say it again...  $5 Cocktail Wednesdays!  They're legit. Classics with a touch of Scopa flare. I'm totally in love.  I think that Scopa is the kind of place that East Side Mario's or The Old Spaghetti Factory WISH they were. A friendly, neighbourhood atmosphere, but in the case of Scopa, some really bitchin' food! My friend Sabahat ordered this lamb shank that looked out of this world - like it had the most flavourful meaty crust and juiciest interior. I'm just guessing though, so you'll have to check out her review to confirm. (Official Yelper Callout!)  I went with... well I went with a cocktail. And then I went with another cocktail... But when it came time for food I had a Pancetta Pizza: smoked pancetta, potato, cream sauce, roasted garlic, caramelized onion, roasted chillies for $17. I loved the ingredients used but for some reason, this time at least, it was so incredibly greasy. I don't so what it's usually like, but I know it's definitely not like this - our server came over and told us that the pizza would be comped. This really made our experience wonderful and I can't wait to come back. That said, if it wasn't soggy right through with grease, it would have been so damn good! I cant wait to go back and try more"}
{"text":"I will happily give this resto a 5 star rating.  Very family friendly with delicious food."}
{"text":"First, the good: the restaurant is really quite nice, aesthetically. The patio is nice and allows for a bit of an escape from the traffic and otherwise bland surroundings of Centre street. The interior is spacious and tastefully decorated, despite a few drywall repairs on the walls which are unpainted. Nothing's perfect, I suppose. The brunch menu, while small, has a nice balance between traditional breakfast/brunch options and more creative dishes with Italian flair.   I'd give the food itself a 3.5 out of 5. It was relatively decent but nothing overly impressive. The ingredients seem to be high-quality, for the most part, but overall it was slightly bland.   The bad: slow slow slow service. There were maybe 6-7 other tables, including a large table of 8 or 10. Despite that, it took close to an hour to get our food. On top of that, there wasn't much attention paid to our table. Our beverages took roughly 10 minutes, and every time we had a request of the server it was either forgotten about or it took several minutes. They were somewhat apologetic for the slow service, however they offered no concession. They had what appeared to be fresh-made chocolate croissants which they were selling at the front, it would have been nice if they would have offered us something like that to keep us satiated while we waited so long for our food; especially at brunch service where folks have likely not eaten anything all day.  One other thing I observed was at least one of the kitchen staff eating food in the window. He appeared to be the 'garnish' station before the food is expedited, and that put me off a bit. After I saw that I saw the same person touching his face, and I noticed that he wasn't wearing gloves or anything. So when I saw the parsley spray balled on our dishes as they finally arrived at our table, I was a bit trepidatious and slightly nervous/grossed out.   I may try it out again for dinner, but I hope they figure out some key things about operating a restaurant in the meantime."}
{"text":"Ok this place is way over rated. And I have to be honest. The only good thing was the bread that they bring with b.vin and o.oil. We had ordered, Spaghetti carb, lasagna, ling vong and caprese salad. We had to send the spaghetti back and the ling back. Lasagna was terrible w no sauce but my son was so hungry he didnt want to wait. On top of that when we wanted to initially complain about the food our server was no where to be seen. Food had gotten cold by then. It didnt stop there we still had to wait for other stuff. Restaurant was only 25% full that day. So very poor food qlty and service. I will not recommend and will not go there again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food is amazing,  great staff and wonderful atmosphere.  My first choice for Italian fusion in Calgary! !"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday and it was busy. First recommendation is make a reservation on the weekends. We ended up sitting at the bar which suited us fine. The service was great and the food was SO tasty.   We had the wild boar carbonara and it was amazing. The bacon was salty and gave the pasta the right amt of salt to the dish. Pasta cooked slightly under which It's suppose to be. We also had the funghi pizza and it too was great. Crust is home  Made and on the thin side. Delish. We had prochuto added"}
{"text":"First time by friend recommendation and wow.   Flawless service and ambience is great. Very clean inside and even a gas fire place.  Our server was quick to take our order and refill our drinks.   Sample bread of funghi was delicious. Ordered the Genoa pizza which was salami, peppers and asiago cheese. One of the best pizzas I have ever eaten.   Great place for evening out and kids are welcome.   One of few five stars for me will be coming back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Scopa last night for dinner and had a great time. We initially made reservations and were suppose to be seated inside but it was nice out and the hostess easily moved us outside to their new patio, which was a great start. The initial service was a little slow, as our server was busy, but since my friend and I hadn't seen each other in a while we weren't in a rush. We shared the calamari as an appetizer and both had the fungi pizza. Both of which were super tasty.  What actually made the night though was our server's (Jesse/Jessie) recovery. Once she had caught up, she was incredible! She spent time chatting with us and provided us with samples of traditional after dinner drinks and Italian culture. Even though we were there till close she was still really sweet and friendly and we never felt rushed to leave.  For me, it was our server's kindness and friendly nature that really capped off my first visit to Scopa."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Italian food! I had a chef friend tell me that if you want to gauge how good an Italian restaurant is, you try their calamari, their lasagna, and their tiramasu. All three of these are delicious at Scopa.   But that's just the start. I've also had their Carbonara, their cannelloni, and their gnocchi and it's always delicious. Their service is friendly and professional and it's always a pleasure to come back.   EXCELLENT JOB SCOPA!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to many Italian spots in Calgary but for my sis's birthday, she needed a spot big enough to fit about 20 people. Scopa Neighbourhood Italian was big enough to accommodate her party so we were there on a Saturday evening.  The inside is very cozy and Italian with red and white striped booths and wooden tables. The place was very, very busy so I'd suggest making a reservation if you don't want to wait.  The regular menu is one massive page: bruschetta, antipasta, insalata, piatto (sandwiches), pizza and pasta. Their drink menu was the same: beer, wine and bubbly. They have a Thursday family feast ($35.00) and happy hour is weekdays from 3:00pm to 5:00pm.  - Gahan blueberry ale ($9.50) - blueberry beer sounded promising. It wasn't bad but not much blueberry tones to it. - Minestrone ($7.00) - O was hungry before our group meal so he ordered this to whet his appetite. - Olive marinate - good start to our meal. - Pomodoro and funghi bruschetta - tasty sharing bites. - Arancini - Calamari - crispy and well battered. - Verde - Risotto - creamy yet still had a bite to it. - Spaghetti alla carbonara - al dente and satisfying. - Asparagus - Filetto di maiale - the gnocchi was a bit too doughy but everything else on this plate was good. Fennel slaw was light and refreshing. - Chocolate torte and panna cotta - save the best for last right? We polished both desserts off at mock speed. Chocolate torte was rich, creamy and decadent. The candied hazelnuts was icing on the cake! Panna cotta had interesting flavours of orange blossom, honey and pistachio shortbread sprinkled on top.  For $50.00/person, this was a great group meal. You won't go hungry. Will have to come back to try their Thursday family feast and to try their pizza's."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with our family and what amazing food and top caliber service!  We had a nice leisurely dinner with a few courses and the timing was impeccable.  A couple of the people ordering at our table  asked questions about the food and the waitress took time to check and came back with answers that later proved to be correct.  The food is excellent and they have a good wine and beer list (with lots of beers on tap).  If this restaurant were in my neighborhood I would be there once a week.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality they serve."}
{"text":"$5 craft cocktail Wednesdays!!!! It's outed. And it's all day long. And they're not shitty cocktails! No siree! When I first saw the sign, I thought I'd be in for a load of hiballs. It ain't so. Carefully crafted cocktails with premium, fresh ingredients. Say it is so!   My last 3 out of 4 Wednesdays have been spent at Scopa with Bartender Tyler making me and my friends delicious creations from behind the bar. My favourite from the signature cocktail menu has got to be the Nouvo, Bulleit Bouron, Peperoncino Liquer, ginger and orange. (Fun fact: liquer isn't a misspelling. It's actually a word for any strongly flavoured alcoholic beverage typically served in small quantities after dinner... or in my case, for my liquid dinner). The Pera e Cannella runs a close second (Pear Vodka, Galliano, cinnamon, grape and mint).  Come in with your friends and grab a table, or become my friend and join me at the bar where we'll enjoy this ridiculous special until Scopa's had enough of us and bumps them back to full price on Wednesdays (then we'll have to switch to 1/2 price bottle wines on Tuesdays, $5 mimosa and Caesar Sundays, $5 Big Rock Mondays or just be a regular Joe for happy hour the rest of the time). In the meantime, though, we can use all that extra money to eat the lovely food coming out of Chef Sheldon's kitchen... believe you me, you're going to need it. I can't help but want to have the entire pizza to myself here, though to date my friends and I have shared the margherita and the funghi pizzas. The linguini pasta is also quite delightful-an extra 5 stars for not over cooking the noodles. Come make an al dente in your appetite for dinner.  Other notable favourites: the Arancini (saffron risotto cakes, grana padano, tomato) and the calamari.  You can thank me on Wednesday. See you there!"}
{"text":"Walking in, this is a family style place that's comfortable enough to bring kids but also nice enough for an evening out in a relaxed atmosphere. There's a good selection of wines and the menu is quite simple. I've eaten here about a dozen times both inside and on the patio.   Service is very good here and they'll often offer recommendations if you are unsure. Due to my lactose intolerance, I am careful at Italian restos as everything usually has cheese or milk in it- the meat, the sauces, the pastas etc. This has never been an issue to get a pizza without cheese.   My fave item is spaghetti and meatballs followed by the veal and lamb. Although the meatballs have cheese in them, I'm able to take pills that allow me to savour the flavour and texture. I can't rave enough about them!!! Portions are quite large and for a small eater, they'd likely make it 1/3 of the way through it. I've eaten all the meatballs and 2/3 pasta. It's gluttonous and glorious at the same time, LOL!!! I've also had every bruschetta and enjoy the mushrooms one a lot. The veal and lamb are prepared to perfection. Tender and tasty!!! Pizzas are also thin crust and tasty if that's what you like. I've only had one dish that did not excite me and that was the chicken penne in cream sauce.   As for price point, you get a lot of quality food and great service. Hurry!!!"}
{"text":"Ignore what people are saying here and put this place on your list!  Went to Scopa a second time this past weekend and it truly made our day.  It was the perfect atmosphere, casual yet smart and breezy with ultra high ceilings that still feels intimate.  I had the feature artichoke soup topped with a scallop that had been dipped in a porcini powder before being seared. The soup was gorgeous. There was more asparagus puree than cream, which really let the veggie shine. Velvety, luxurious and the scallop was done perfectly and had the right meatiness to complement it.  For my main, I ordered the funghi pizza that I'd had the last time. It is sinfully perfect. Creamy, cheesy thin crust that is good to last bite of the crust. Mushrooms aren't overwhelmed and the truffle oil just right. Everything you want your mushroom pizza to be.  The boy ordered the boar bacon carbonara and if I wasn't loving my dish so much, I would have eaten his too. The boar bacon chunks were generous and have a smokey depth that you just don't get from regular bacon. The pasta was perfectly al dente, a true pleasure alone, plus the magic of the egg yolk and their parmesan was bang on: I dipped the rest of my crusts in it once he'd finished.  An appie, two mains, plus a glass of wine and two beers later between the two of us came to $66 before tip. Our server was friendly, attentive and genuine; you could really tell he took pleasure when you were happy.  The last time I'd gone with my Mom and her boyfriend and we shared the spinaci salad, that includes oranges, black olives, feta, cucumber and pistachio. Bright, crunchy and well dressed. Excellent textures. Highly recommended!  Their risotto of the day was a green pea, lemon and yellow tomato risotto. Another great work in balance, the softer flavors of the vegetables weren't overpowered by the richness of the risotto and was unique in its lightness. It's too bad I couldn't get that again!  I thought their arancini was OK, though I prefer the overly decadent ones at Cibo instead, but they were nice and light and didn't stop you from enjoying your dinner, so that could be a good thing too.  We're definitely excited to explore more of the menu and you should too. It was solid value and memorable both times."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance in this restaurant.   The service was good, could have been better. It seemed they were short staffed that day though.   If you ask about gluten free, thankfully they have a gluten free substitute for most of their pasta's. Thank goodness!   They don't have a gluten free pizza crust :( My girlfriend had the Fungi pizza and it was amazing, I had a bite even though I paid for it (gluten sensitivity).  Tuesday's they have half price wine, which is a bonus!  You need reso's to get in on the weekend. A group of four tried a few months ago and we couldn't. If their tiny parking lot is full you can park in the Italian market's lot. They are all owned by the same person.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food for the price and atmosphere! The bartender was great and offered great recommendations. Had a great time."}
{"text":"I finally got to try Scopa and it was absolutely fantastic!  Everything is clearly in house made and it shows.  The foccacia was as light as clouds paired with a basil infused butter and the classic EVO and balsamic.  The arancini was smothered in a simple smashed tomato ragu with a hint of basil.  My Garganelli pasta was doused in a light creamy mushroom ragout finished with sweet peas that popped in your mouth.  Great price point for some awesome wines on the main menu.  Our server was a real gem to!"}
{"text":"Scopa is one of our go-to Italian restaurants. It is consistently good with a great atmosphere. Over the past couple of years we have tried many items from various areas of the menu, and I don't think we have ever been disappointed. At times, the volume gets to a point where it may be difficult to have a conversation, but that is to be expected.  Their wine list is good, although it is heavily skewed to Italian wines.  Reservations are a good idea, given how popular it is. The new patio is a welcome addition, but keep in mind it is open and exposed to rain. Parking is most often an issue."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at Scopa. The waitress was nice and efficient, The food was pretty hit and miss. One person had a burger, which was very good. The artisan pizza looked very nice. The carbonara was way too salty. Two of us had the Caesar salad. It was terrible. I love a good Caesar salad, this was probably the worst I've ever had. It lack dressing, it was so dry it was flavourless and there was no lemon to give it a little zing. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"There was not one thing I didn't like here.. I have been there twice, and both times everything I had has been delicious... Starting for the wine: it is just great!!.. The recommended wine was awesome... The appetizers are excellent!!.. The last time I went we were a group of 10 people and we ordered all breads and appetizers available, I tried a little bit of each one, and they were all delicious!!.. The main course was great as well.. The first time I had the risotto, and the second time I had pasta, both times both dishes were outstanding... I definitely recommend this place 100% .. I can't wait to go back there !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went with our friends Thursday night for some food and drinks. We arrived at 9:40 and the kitchen closes at 10. We were able to get our orders in time. The restaurant was totally empty except for our party. We had a margherita pizza which was pretty good - about a small size. The calamari was good too but very tiny rings. The drinks were expensive. I had a cocktail for $12 and my husband had a beer for $8. The food was good but not the best. The parking lot is small and there's a bit of construction going on so that takes up some space in their lot as well"}
{"text":"I am shocked.   Linguini Vongole, more like Chinese noodle soup with clams?  Arancini with truffle aoli, more like arancini with mayonnaise.  Also I'm pretty sure parsley is not considered micro greens.   I'm very disappointed with the quality of food. Perhaps Calgary isn't know for its Italian, or Scopa isn't know for its pasta.  TLDR: Don't bother."}
{"text":"Great for any occasion! The people there are wonderful, especially Tim the manager. The risotto is hands down my favorite and I haven't had a dish I didn't like as of yet.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian food I have ever had ... I'll go back to Calgary to have dinner there again"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious (my end of the table tried salad, calamari, ravioli, panna cotta & cannoli for dessert and lots of red and white wine - everyone loved what they ordered). The service was very friendly and our group was well looked after. I would definitely come back. It would be a nice place for a date night as well."}
{"text":"After reading John Gilchrist's reviews for his picks for best new restaurants of 2014, I have to say he missed the mark big time here.  Really? #3 for Scopa?    We went under the recommendation of a friend who specifically goes for the half price wine Tuesdays.  As we are not drinkers, we went on a Thursday for lunch and I have to say, it looks very sharp inside.  I still see minor bits of the old Boccavino in the bar and I feel that although they tried really hard to make this place upscale trendy Italian, it was not what I was expecting especially after reading the rave reviews.  It was just a random Thursday a few weeks ago so I can't see being out of stock for several ingredients as sufficient reasoning for substituting most of my meal with items that I wasn't expecting.  Hubby wanted the chicken parm, they were out...ok, how about the arugula salad with pear? Nope, out of arugula...sigh.  The waitress, who was a lovely girl recommended we go with arugula salad to share but she will substitute the arugula with mixed greens and to go with focaccia as well. We agreed to that and the man ended up ordering some chicken pasta dish with peas and mushrooms, and I had the sirloin steak sandwich.    The best part of the meal was the bread.  The salad was basically a spinach salad with a few nuts, some grapefruit, which wasn't mentioned in the menu or as a sub that we were informed of, and shredded cheese in a vinaigrette- my house salad kicks this salads ass, sorry.  We should have stuck to the spinach salad.  My husbands meal was this thick, rich, starchy concoction of penne, roast chicken (think rotisserie chicken with meat pulled off) frozen peas and a few mushrooms in a thick roux like sauce. It came luke warm and just had too much chicken chunks.  My \"steak\" sandwich was basically a random cut of odd meat, because it wasn't beef or if it was, it was sitting around a few days because it was by far the worst cut of meat I have tasted in my life.  It was metallic tasting and the texture was off too; I know my steak, and this was no sirloin.  It sat on a drenched slice of bread in a demi glaze that was a soggy mess (although the demi was alright) that did nothing to mask the awful cut of meat that was served.  The chips on the side looked like chips alright, Pringles to be exact, deep fried golden brown Pringles.  They would have been 1000x better as home fries.  I explained to the waitress that I could not eat the steak and inquired as to exactly what cut it was, she described it as being cooked on a spit that they cut?  That's F'd up, is this a steak or a donair?  She was very kind about the whole thing and removed it from the bill.  We tipped her generously because it obviously wasn't her fault and left.    I give place two stars because the waitress was fantastic and the concept is there, I just think we came on an off day.  Would I come back?  Probably not, I think that some of these peoples perception of this food being amazeballs could be contributed to the half price wine Tuesdays :P    If you are looking for real Italian, drive up 10 min to Eau Claire and go to Prego, best in Calgary, hands down."}
{"text":"So, I live only a few blocks away but after seeing their menu I had decided not to try it due to it's lack of anything Vegan.  Last night when my BF asked where we should go and said, \"Do you want to try Scopa?\" I thought perhaps I should call and see what they can offer us.  I'm so glad I did. We had amazing food. After telling the server we were Vegan and she went and checked with the Chef and kitchen, we were set!!  They never once asked if we wanted Parm on anything!! We get that all the time btw or when the salad comes there is Parm on it already even when they know we are Vegan.  I would recommend this place for sure! The chef is excellent and the pasta was delish. Large enough to share actually or skip the appies next time.  Thanks all at Scopa!!"}
