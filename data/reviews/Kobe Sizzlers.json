{"text":"Best Halal Steak I have found around so far. The r restaurants also built Decatur for larger families which is great .the owner is wonderful. this is the first time a Halal steak was done properly when ordered medium rare!"}
{"text":"It was date nite with our friends and decided on Kobe ... To start with the initial 3 star rating did not set expectations high.

However, the service was amazing from Megan (spelling?) who knew the restaurant menu from heart and made some recommendations, ALL of which were superb.  The Manager was handling his customers knowing that 50% of your reputation is customer experience, which proved that attention to detail, always smiling and actually listening to customers will only make his business grow.

The food, was really really good as the portions were generous, the sauces depending on your choice were tasty and flavourful, and the multitude of toppings were perfectly portioned.  

We started with the lollipop chicken. While I have had this appetizer at other restaurants, the chicken was fully cooked, crispy and the Szechuan spicy sauce for dipping really made it enjoyable to eat. The two sizzlers, one with chicken and one with beef with two different choices of sauces were portioned well enough for four (4) adults. The flavour was really good and the accompaniments were plentiful, especially the mushrooms with the beef and the vegetables with the chicken.  

To wash this food down, I had the blue Margarita  which was sooo good. My friend had the Pina Colada which was very refreshing. 

Finally the dessert, brownie sizzler sitting on top
of pineapple rings accompanied with two scoops of ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce at the table was a nice finish to our date nite dinner.

Highly recommend for the service, hospitality and delicious food."}
{"text":"Although I agree the portions were large, the food was bland and lacking any distinct flavour. The meals are extremely overpriced. I had their Kobe Special Steak for $28 and it was horrible. The steak was a horrible cut and chewy. Definitely not worth the $28 that we paid for it. It felt and tasted like a low cut steak you would buy at the Food Basics down the street. A dinner for 3 was $110 tax and tip. I was the only one who could finish my dinner, with the other two patrons not able to get through half of it. The servers are a little too attentive, removing our glasses of water even before we paid the bill. Definitely will not be returning.

What really annoyed me more than anything was the use of processed cheese on the steak...like really?"}
{"text":"The chicken lollipop starter was very tasty. We ordered the paneer shashlik and vegetarian satellite and both of them were good. The service was however not very good as the server was asking dumb questions.Overall the food was better than what we had expected."}
{"text":"Loved our sizzler that we ordered here. They serve up some mean Indian sryle sizzlers at this joint. Ths servings are huge, I shared mine with my SIL. We also had their lolipop chicken for app and for dessert we had their sizzling brownie. The sizzling brownie was great, sizzling hot brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some nuts to dress it. Will definitely look to go back again."}
{"text":"Great place! The food was great, the service was wonderful. The sizzlers taste just as authentic as the ones you get back in Mumbai."}
{"text":"This place is highly overrated. 

First impressions was decent. The wait staff was pleasant and attentive and the restaurant looked nice. 

Then we were seated and discovered that alcohol was not served here.  Really?  Ok. Then looked at the prices which were high for a sizzler plate. Mine was about $30. 

The plates arrived about 15 minutes after ordering and we were very disappointment. The veal was well done even though I asked for it medium. It was the chewiest meat I've ever had. The flavour was sub par and didn't have any Indian flavour at all. Perhaps this is not an Indian restaurant?  But it's classified as one. Anyway I was curious if the other reviewers were wrong and wanted to give this place a try. Next time I will trust the Yelp review rating. 

Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered Kobe special and Shish kabab sizzler. The Chicken in Kobe Special was dry and the peppercorn sauce was very salty. For the $25 price it was. It even worth $10. The service was average!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 10 ppl and tried a variety of different sizzlers. I have to say for chicken sizzlers, price is on the high side. I also don't like how everything comes out do soggy and it was too hot ( on the sizzler) to eat the whole time. I had to blow the food for literally every single bite throughout. 

I ordered the chicken sashlik and the sauce did not taste sweet n sour at all. Service was friendly but a bit slow. Dessert brownie was fantastic"}
{"text":"My wife and I went today. Very friendly staff. I love the idea of the sizzlers. It gets messy if two people are sharing. 
The food is pretty good. A mix of east and west."}
{"text":"First time here and let me tell you yelpers how amazing of an experience it was.

Imagine a BMW going head first into a Lamborghini. That clash of German and Italian technology was the literal equivalent of the explosion of flavors on my tongue. 

The owner(ijaz) spoke to me on the phone when I called to make a reservation and I already knew there would be professionalism. Arrived on time and got promptly seated. Was greeted by Kenneth and informed about the menu. Honestly it felt like a very personal experience from the information to the carefully suggested menu options. 

For appetizers got the chicken lollipops a house favorite, the meat was Succulently amazing. Came with the schezaun sauce for a dip. 8 pieces to the order perfect sharing size. Already had my tongue tingling. 

Had the Kobe special chicken sizzler. Perfect size for 2 with a bed of vegis, mashed potatoes, and fried rice were 2 chicken breasts covered with the peppercorn gravy. Once portioned off I had a plate full of a soft juicy chicken breast with a bed of rice and lots of vegis. Hardly had room for dessert after. 

Had the Kobe special sizzling brownie for dessert with 2/scoops of ice cream. They have ingeniously put pineapples under the brownie so it doesn't stick to the hot plate. The server put chocolate sauce on top of the Brownie and it started sizzling. Keeping true to the sizzler name. Perfect sharing size. 

Overall it was a 5 star experience. Interms of food quantity, server (Lorenzo) was really helpful. And price was still pretty decent for a 3 course meal for 2. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"The place to must go for every MUMBAIKAR. They have maintained the same taste. I have been to this place enough times...that the staff knows my order lol.... try the Chicken Shaslek with shezwan sauce and also upgrade your rice to fried rice!! Don't ever leave this place without trying their sizzling brownie !! 
Note- those who miss Mumbai's taste of Chicken Lollypops .....this is the right place to go !"}
{"text":"Extremely confused by some of the previous reviews. The food was delicious, the service was attentive, the management was warm, but most of all the food was DELICIOUS. It's a new restaurant and the management is very in tune with all the feedback they have been getting and altering things accordingly, which I find very commendable. 

I went with a large party and every single order came out perfectly without any complaints. My husband and I requested that our veal steaks be cooked medium and medium well, which was executed to perfection. You get a choice of 4 sauces: I got the garlic sauce, my husband had pepper, and my parents got chicken sizzlers with the szechuan sauce. All of the sauces accompanied the meat perfectly. I also found the portion sizes to be generous. 

As for the prices, which I see some people have complained about, I found them to be extremely normal and fair for the high quality of food and atmosphere you are getting at Kobe Sizzlers. It's a super modern and clean restaurant that's perfect for weekend dinners or celebrations. 

Oh, and the brownie dessert is seriously amazing."}
{"text":"This restaurant was just okay. The staff were very attentive, knowledgable and friendly but the food was overpriced and mediocre. I ordered a burger which would have been good but the onions and lettuce inside tasted old and almost rotten. The rest of the food was alright, nothing extraordinary and definitely not worth the price. The overall atmosphere of the place was nice though, it was clean and modern."}
{"text":"purely based on taste and how worthy of the cost it was, I wouldn't recommend coming here. I would say the audience it would appeal to is children however the hot sizzling plates are dangerous for kids..

taste: 100% not Indian, no association of Indian flavours, most definitely staffed and run by Indian people but the food is bland when compared to real Indian food. that being said it didn't taste bad, it was, for lack of a better description white food. Mashed potatoes, cooked veggies and barely seasoned chicken breast. 

you're paying for the Instagram video or Facebook picture you're going to impress your friends with. 


that being said the staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"From Mumbai to Dubai and now in Toronto. I have always been a fan of Kobe Sizzlers. I had ordered the Prawns & Fish sizzler with Oyster sauce and the Chicken Shashlik. I was skeptical on trying the burger because I've known this restaurant to serve mainly sizzlers and I didn't know if the burgers would be at that same level of perfection.

You will very well know when the sizzlers are ready. You can hear the sizzles from across the room. I must say they made their sizzlers better than the ones I have tried in India and Dubai. The side order of Shezwan sauce completed the whole sizzler experience, not that the sizzler wasn't good enough by itself, it's just that I have a love for spicy food. 

While enjoying my sizzler, I took a bite of the burger. It was heaven. I know I had kept my expectations low but it turned out to be very tasty.

Next time I go there again, I look forward to trying the Fish Shashlik and the Veal Steak sizzler. 

Overall this place was really good.

Service: 2.5 - It was a bit slow even though there weren't many people.
Quality: 4.5
Ambience: 4.0"}
{"text":"Expensive but tastes good. Had their steak with chicken and cheese with Szechuan sauce. Fries tasted great but there weren't enough. But there was enough veggies and meat so I can't complain! Very friendly servers. Will be here once in a while"}
{"text":"Loved the food! The service was A1 even on a super busy day. Call beforehand to get reservations. Vegetarian people order paneer and cheese sizzler with house special schezuan sauce and you won't regret. The owner is super friendly!"}
{"text":"I need to say excellent service was on point the staff was very friendly and explained everything. So we got the chicken corn soup which was very tasty and the mix sizzler which was delicious too the meat melts in your mouth.After we ordered the special brownie sizzler which was tasty as well they put ice cream on top of the hot brownie and bring it on a hot sizzling plate after it's on the table they put chocolate on top of it and it's starts sizzeling the ice cream starts melting it is so tasty.I would highly recommend the place. A place which I'm sure I didn't visit the last time"}
{"text":"They are a very sorry recollection of Kobe sizzlers that we used to love in India. The prices are very high for the quality and quantity of food that you get. The taste of the food is also nothing to write home about. Paid about 60$ for two sizzlers (one vegetarian and one non-vegetarian) for myself and wife and walked out hungry.
The sizzler plate is flat, while it gives a false impression of sufficient quantity. The taste was just A-OK too. Our server didn't stop by our table between dropping the food order and bringing the cheque. The rice was placed directly on the sizzler plate causing them to stick to it, rather than on a bed or lettuce/cabbage as usual.
We walked out disappointed. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"Really good customer service. The Waiter was knowledgeable and helped us pick the right options for dinner. 
Food was good too. My kids enjoyed the food as well. 
The sizzling brownie dessert was also motivation for them to finish their meal!"}
{"text":"This place is way over-hyped. 

The space is nice and easy to locate. The restaurant was quite empty when we entered and never filled up past a few tables, which was a bit odd for a weekend night. 

The appetizers deserve 1-star at best. We ordered the shrimp cocktail which was literally a margarita cocktail glass filled to the brim with tartar sauce and a few shrimp lodged inside. No joke, it was *literally* a tartar sauce cocktail. We also tried some of the soups and they were bland - lacking in body and flavour. I've had better canned soups. 

The main course - we tried a few different sizzlers. The combo sizzler comes with a variety of bite-sized proteins (steak, shrimp, fish, chicken, and an egg) and was perfect for sharing with another person. Everything was drowning in sauce and the sauces weren't Indian-influenced or classical, which is something we were expecting. Overall, the sizzler worked out nicely as it comes with vegetables and your choice of potato (fries or mash). 

Oh, and don't even think about washing down the spice with some beer - this place doesn't serve any alcohol. 

Our server was polite and attentive. He happily split our bills which made our life easy."}
{"text":"Feeling sick after eating at Kobe Sizzlers. The amount of sauce in the food was extensive leaving it tasteless. Also it is disgusting that the servers have long hairs which touch the food and water. The server's hair dipped the water glasses we had. Working at the good industry, servers should have some level of personal hygiene. The owner has no interest in running a successful restaurant and pleasing it's customers. Wouldn't even give it a rating of one star. That bad the quality of food and experience at this place. Very very expensive and not at all worth it."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice because I like to give restaurants a second chance. Both times were disappointing. The gist of it is that it's OVERPRICED. I ordered the mixed grill sizzler that boasts that it comes with extra veggies, steak, shrimp, chicken and fish. It is steeply priced at $31.99 but only comes with bite sized pieces of each protein and the biggest disappointment is the fish. At $31.99, you should not be serving me basa fish. The \"steak\" was a joke. Very small chunks of overlooked beef even though we asked for medium well. The schezuan fried rice was good but for a place that specializes in sizzlers, that shouldn't be the best dish. There is plenty of room for improvement when it comes to quality and pricing. I hope the owner takes the reviews into consideration and makes the much needed changes as I love supporting the halal community."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant last night with a friend, it was both our first time. 
The restaurant itself was pretty spacious and very clean. The service we received here was top notch. 

Our server was pleasant and very attentive - always topped our water. She gave us great recommendations and explained the menu to us in detail. We also met the owner of the restaurant. He was quite polite and seemed very passionate about his business. 

Unfortunately, I wish the food was just as great as the service. We ordered the 'Steak with Cheese and Mushroom', the 'Chicken Satellite' and the 'Chicken Pakora'. Both the sizzling dishes were smothered with cheese, cream and gravy however, this didn't add any depth to the dish because it lacked in flavour. The chicken pakoras were the only thing I enjoyed here. 

I regret to say I won't be coming back since this place also gave me a stomach ache =("}
{"text":"Didn't realize Kobe was a type of beef kept thinking of the basketball player haha . But all jokes aside this place was phenomenal. I ordered a a steak and cheese sizzler done medium well. And as the name suggests it came out sizzling in a hot plate and it was delicious. My main regret is not waiting for it to cool down and burning my tongue. 

I got mashed potatoes vs fries as a side and I'm glad I did it complemented the dish quite well along with the garlic sauce they put on , tbh I'm not sure why anyone would order the fries as a side (you have a choice of fries or mash). Only complaints were I felt a lot of the side vegetables were not necessary and didn't add much to the dish, and also that it was quiteeee pricey for the portion of food. I didn't find it very filling considering the high price."}
{"text":"Newly opened resturant.   For halal steak there are not a lot of options so I was happy to find out that another halal steak house had opened as I love steak.  The seating is nice and comfortable.   The service overall was very good.   The waitress wells friendly and knowledgable enough about the menu.  We ordered the chicken shashlik for he kids and they liked it.  I ordered the sizzling steak with pepper sauce. I had ordered it medium and They cooked it right. My wife got the Kobe Beef steak.  It was also good.  Overall the good was good.  The only issue I think there was that the beef was a little chewy but I have not found great halal steak meat at any store so I am going to say that the meat quality was also acceptable.  Overall a great experience and will definitely come again.   After the Second and third visits I am going to change my opinion on the food.  It is inconsistent so great food one time and bad food the second time.   Hoping u catch them on their good day.  :-)"}
{"text":"Good for sizzlers and the all time favourite sizzling brownie ice cream. Starters not recommended though, specially the chilly  cheese toast is nothing like what you get in India."}
{"text":"Went there reminiscing good old Bombay days ... But neither the taste nor did the price do any justice .... Signature dish the chilli cheese toast was over ..... So odd for a restaurant to have their signature dish over ! Chicken lollipops were the only dish with any flavour both sizzlers were bland, just soya sauce splashed over everything! Sizzlers were for 20 bucks each and trust me it's not as loaded as back home. Never going back!"}
{"text":"My family and I are absolute fans of sizzlers and we are so happy to have found a joint that serves authentic sizzlers, just like we used to have in Mumbai!  Absolutely delicious and the service was just as great!  We ordered three sizzlers for four people and it was a sizzler fest!  We had a paneer cheese sizzler, prawns and fish shashlik, and prawns sizzler.  The sauces were perfectly flavoured, good portion size and it comes sizzling to the table.  The wait time is quite little and we are definitely going to attend here again."}
{"text":"I came to Kobe Sizzlers for a holiday get-together with some friends. Hearing about it's worldwide presence and popularity, I was excited to give it a shot. 

The restaurant was pretty much empty at 6pm on a Wednesday evening, so I was promptly seated. After waiting for a while for the rest of my party, we made our order shortly after 6:30pm - restaurant still empty. 

The menu has your standard Indian apps, some salad options, and burger options, but the vast majority of the menu focuses on sizzling plates of veg/non-veg combinations. The sizzlers are quite pricy (almost all are $20+), but according to our waiter, are intended for sharing. Between our table of 5, we ordered 2 sizzlers and 2 appetizers. With the sizzlers, you had the choice of sauce (garlic, pepper, szechwan, mushroom) and between mashed potatoes/french fries.

The sizzling poutine fries ($7) were decent - not using cheese curds is a -1 in my books but it was tasty nonetheless. We had two orders of these fries though, and I couldn't help but notice that one plate sizzled a lot more than the other. No biggie.

The first of our sizzlers to arrive was the Kobe Special Beef Steak ($28) with szechwan sauce and mashed potatoes. We requested that the steak be cooked to medium. What we actually got? Beyond well done. Chewy. A little gross to be honest. It was definitely not a good cut of meat. Luckily, the flavour from the szechwan sauce was decent. The mashed potatoes were decent and the assortment of vegetables tasted really good after cooking on the cast iron plate. 

The second sizzler we ordered was the Toridango Chicken ($23) with garlic sauce and french fries. This one tasted much better than the steak. I was very happy with the flavour in the chicken and would highly recommend it. Like the steak sizzler, this one also came with sauteed vegetables. 

The two sizzlers came with quite a bit of food, but i definitely feel like they are intended to be individual servings, despite what I was told by the staff.

The food I'd definitely give a 3, maybe even 3.5/5, despite the incorrectly cooked steak. What was really bad about this place was the service. There were a few forgivable errors throughout the night that I didn't mind - water refills for only some glasses, extended wait periods for requests. 

[reason for 1 star rating] The part that really annoyed me though was the inattentiveness when we were trying to pay for the bill. The restaurant was starting to fill up at around 8pm when we asked for the bill. Our initial request didn't do much at all - 5 minutes and it didn't look like anyone was even starting to put our bill together. So we asked again - and waited. 5 minutes later our waiter came back with a notepad asking how we wanted to split our bill... so we told him exactly how we wanted it done. 5 minutes later and still nothing.. Then a different person came back to us with the same notepad, asking us to confirm the way we wanted the bill split (is this really necessary?). He walked away, and we waited another 5 minutes... then our waiter comes back and apologizes, saying it would take another 2 minutes. That's fine, but in that time, he was clearly not trying to resolve the issue and continued to help other customers. At this point, we were just fed up. We called him back and said that we've been waiting nearly 30 minutes just to pay our bills... his response? \"Well I waited 30 minutes for you guys to order...\" .... ummm what? 

We ultimately talked to the manager who told us that the reason for the long wait time was that they were having technical issues with splitting the bills. I can understand that, but 30 minutes is just unacceptable for a group just trying to pay a bill and leave. The issue was not communicated nor handled in a professional manner. As we were leaving, the manager even had the nerve to say \"if you review us, please don't mention the wait time\". Psshhhhhh, yeah right. [/reason for 1 star rating]

I'm overall disappointed with Kobe Sizzlers cause I actually liked most of the food, but the service was just too much of an issue. Normally I'd be more forgiving to new restaurants with bad service (they've only been open for about a month), but the method in which they handled their issues just left a sour taste in my mouth. I won't go back."}
{"text":"It was his recommendation that we go to Kobe Sizzlers. The food was very flavourful and well presented. The food does take awhile to come once ordered, but the wait is worth it. Our server was amazing and gave his recommendations which were helpful. Loved the ice tea, made fresh. 
For dessert, The sizzling ice cream brownie with pecans and almond is to die for.
Will definitely go again. 
Want to try something different, you should go too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is part of a chain that originated in India in 1975 - they have locations worldwide now. I visited New Years Day for lunch, not being sure what to expect given the mixed reviews so far. 

For 4 people, we ordered 2 apps, 3 sizzlers, and 1 dessert and this was a good amount of food for us. 

For each sizzler, you have an option of fries or mashed potatoes, as well as a choice of 4 sauces.

The 3 sizzlers we got were: Kobe Special Chicken with Rice, Sizzling Chicken, Steak Shashlik. All were pretty good but I preferred the Special Chicken. 

Chicken Lollipops: total of 8 pieces, pretty decent - comes with their Szechuan sauce
Hot & Sour Soup with Chicken: average
Pina Colada Mocktail: good
Kobe Special Sizzling Brownie - brownie and ice cream combo. The server pours chocolate sauce on top causing the plate to sizzle and steam, so a fun end to the meal. 

Service was solid throughout, including being warmly greeted by manager (possibly owner) when we entered. The 3 sizzlers came staggered over 5-10 minutes which may matter if you're in a group each ordering individually, but since we were sharing family-style, it was no problem for us.

It's on the more expensive side at $25/person + taxes/tips but the concept is different so worth trying. Food was 3.5 and service bumps this up to a 4.

I'd suggest to management that they update their menu to include what cut of meat/chicken is used - e.g. one of our dishes was breast meat, another thigh - but this wasn't disclosed on the menu. Also, the issue with the sizzling brownie is that the sauce quickly caramelizes and burns, as does the bottom of the brownie. It would be better to put the brownie on a small plate on top of the sizzler, and then only pour some of the chocolate sauce (so you get that fun effect, but don't have to taste burnt sauce/brownie).

Note: Website and Yelp hours of operations do not match, not sure which is accurate so call before going"}
{"text":"Service is okay. Staff seems new. Owner is nice. Staff needs more training as not able to provide recommendations. Nice people. Food is alright. Servings are over priced."}
{"text":"Been a few times now, steak sizzler is amazing and chocolate brownie sizzler (worth sharing though). Friendly place, be careful as sizzler oil will get to your clothes."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here. Owners are Muslim. Ordered take out from here.  Had the veal steak pieces (was good), the chicken szechwan (good) and the beef and chicken with cheese (didnt have enough cheese for me).  Food was a bit pricey, but good amount of food/meat for the money.  Nice interior of restaurant with friendly service. The garlic sauce was good too.  Will have to come back again to try out some of the mocktails and desserts"}
{"text":"Fake-to-the-ASS Indian food. Not even remotely close to authentic Indian sizzler. It's so so so American style, yet again not close to any decent Western family restaurant. Food quality was below average yet tab was quite expensive. There are so many good, authentic Indian places in Mississauga, for your own walket's sake, don't even bother with this one."}
{"text":"We have gone to this restaurant twice now and the staff are friendly and efficient.  The food is amazing and unique. We always had leftovers and brought them home for lunch and dinner the next day!  I feel like the food is homemade answer taste delicious!  The drinks are also fun and delicious!"}
{"text":"The good:
-Good service
-Serving size is larger than usual so two can dine by getting an app and a main dish
-The veggies, rice and fries that came as part of the dish were great

The so-so:
-We ordered the beef steak (veal was out) which was somewhat chewy (Affy's steak is much better imo)
-The brownie is overrated! It's decent but I have had much better brownie/ice cream combos (moxie's white chocolate brownie)

Verdict:
-Will likely come back as the flavor of the food was good (except for steak) and therefore will order a chicken dish instead (hard to screw up chicken)
-it's a new restaurant and hopefully it'll only get better"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. The food was good and really filling. Dessert is a must and opened room in your stomach with you took the first bite super delicious! Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Finally a sizzler after couple of years 
Hope they maintain the consistency 
Good service as well"}
{"text":"I would NOT recommend this place. This was our first and last time, 
Overpriced for the quality of meat served . We had the steak sizzler and the steak had a fishy smell to it . It almost felt like it was frozen steak and the meat had not thawed.  The Kobe sizzler in Dubai was great so we thought this one would be good too . Extremely disappointed. 

When we were asked if we liked the meal, we told management how we felt , all they said was that they will let the chef know. I hope the Chef knows now."}
{"text":"The steak sizzler was terrible I would suggest not to order that. The chicken club, on the other hand , wash very tasty. The service was good at most. Overly priced. Not a repeat."}
{"text":"I was anxiously waiting for this place to open since May of 2015, they had some mishaps and delays in their opening process which caused them to open in December 2015. Needless to say I was very excited when I got an email stating they were opening soon. 
Fast forward to opening day and I found myself waiting outside as if I was waiting to purchase the newest IPhone. Upon entering I was treated like a mini celebrity, I had my picture taken and the owners came to congratulate me on being the first North American guest/customer. 
My party and I were promptly shown to our table, since I have already visited the South Asian location of this chain I already knew what I wanted and ordered very promptly. I ordered the Kobe Special Fried Rice Sizzler. 
The food itself was very good and tasted exactly like it did back in India; it also helped that they brought a chef from India to cook here. Not only did it taste good, but the quantities were HUGE, I could barely finish my meal; a first for me eating at any restaurant in recent memory. 
Surprisingly I had room for dessert and had the Kobe Special Sizzler Brownie, once again the quantity was very big but I was a little unimpressed with the dessert. I was hoping for a traditional twist and not something common that I could find at another restaurant. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention the service, asides from the prompt service, the server was very attentive and willing to answer any questions we had! As mentioned above since I was already familiar with the menu I didn't have any questions to ask. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a change, I will long be a regular at this place."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was horrible.  Had to remind the staff numerous times that we had ordered appetizers but they still forgot.  Our main dishes came before the appetizers so we ended up cancelling appetizers. Had ordered drinks as well and again after multiple reminders the drinks never came .  Once we asked for the check the manager came by and said that the drinks are ready and suggested we take them home.  This enraged us more rather than apologizing the managers wanted us to pay for the drinks and take them home with us.  Spoke to the wait staff and the lady said he is like that with all customers and he only cares about making money.  Manager needs a crash course in customer service."}
{"text":"My first time. Excellent experience: impressed by the friendly service; flavourful, unique food, and the atmosphere. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Kobe sizzlers is a franchise from India that has some branches all around the world! I had the chance to visit it whilst in toronto .. Their food portion are huge and filling ! Their signature and particularity is to serve almost all of their meals on one sizzler, i tried their chicken lollipop and a sizzling mox grill with steak, i was so full i didnt have space to try the sizzling brownie but will go back for it :)!"}
{"text":"I used to eat at Kobe sizzlers in Pune. Pretty good. Been there a few times now and the taste is pretty consistent."}
{"text":"I've been to this place before and it had good food but bad service. Today my experience was pathetic with terrible food and service from the owner/manager asking me to just eat and leave the place because I complained against his undercooked bland chicken which according to him is the best dish of the restaurant (Chicken Shashlik). He offered to replace my dish but was persistent that it would taste the same. My second dish was Beef with cheese and mushrooms but apparently not because they ended up making Beef Satellite and wouldn't replace it again arguing that I asked for the latter. Definitely need a management change or just shut down."}
{"text":"Second time here. Not sure if it was what I ordered, the sauce I chose or the food was just better but I had a pretty good experience.

Food:
-Sauces: We were graciously allowed to try them all before ordering. We ended up liking the szechuan sauce but the garlic sauce suited the poutine well. Szechuan for everything else if you enjoy a little spice
-Chicken lollipop: Delicious, especially with the szechuan sauce. 9/10
-Poutine sizzler: I don't normally enjoy regular Canadian poutine but I actually liked this and so did my dad from seeing him eat even the crispy bits. 7/10.
-Steak and chicken sizzler with cheese: Not sure if I got the name right. I added a fried egg on top. It was a generous amount of food. The chicken is a lot better than the steak so next time I might just order a chicken only dish. That being said the steak is still good with szechuan sauce and the chicken is very nicely cooked. Good balance between sauteed vegetables and fries as sides on the platter. For taste, I'd give it a 7/10 but overall satisfaction came out to a solid 8-8.5/10. Great for a big eater like myself.
-Special Sizzling Brownie: Delicious but learn from my lesson the first time I ordered it (and found a viable solution for this time). The brownie comes out very hot on a platter with ice cream on top. They pour chocolate syrup onto it which immediately starts sizzling. The heat rapidly melts the ice cream and in my haste to eat it while the ice cream was still a ball of ice cream and not soup, I burned my tongue on the molten hot innards of the brownie. I don't do well with hot food and tend to burn my tongue often so maybe it's just me. Anyway, solution: ask for the ice cream on a plate on the side so it stays cool until the brownie cools to a reasonable temperature. This worked very well and it was delicious with butterscotch ice cream. 9/10
-Service: Outstanding. It's gotten even better and it was pretty good the first time too. 10/10
-Value: this is entirely a personal topic but while it's on the pricey side, the portions are big and the food is pretty good so I feel the value was overall fair to good.

Would come back! Kudos to the owner for maintaining and improving quality."}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant that has opened within the last week.

It's a restaurant with most of its locations in India, with locations in the UK and the Middle East. 

The dishes are served on a cast iron plate which sits atop a wood base/plate. Careful when the food comes out its hot!

Decor is clean and minimalistic but works well. The server was pleasant and happy to make suggestions which was helpful. 

They have a large menu with many options. Several fish, beef, chicken, and some veal options with differing sauces and accompaniments.  With each dish except for the specials you choose between a garlic, Szechwan, pepper, and mushroom sauce. 

We tried the following:

Special Kobe Veal with the mushroom sauce: tasty, and works well with the veal. 
Special Beef and Chicken combination: asked for the beef medium rare came out essentially medium. Went with the Szechwan sauce, and a fried egg on top. Chose the mash potatoes as a side. Also has vegetables and gravy as do all the dishes. Steak was pretty good but a bit chewy. The chicken however was very tender and flavourful.
Special Mixed Grill dish: a great way to try the different meat options. Priciest entree on the menu about 33 dollars. 
Mixed fish and prawns: went with the garlic sauce. Came with fries. This was very tasty - the fish was very tender, flavourful, and essentially melts in your mouth. Definitely one to try!

For desert we had the special sizzling brown with ice cream. Not bad, brownie was ok and ice cream as always works well with brownies. Comes out sizzling, worth a try but nothing spectacular.

For drinks they also have a mocktail menu which we didn't really try much of. Can't comment more on that except to say there were options for piña colada, and other common cocktails (no alcohol of course)

Bottom line: this is an interesting restaurant with a solid variety of dishes. Flavourful, and a different take on the usual halal themed restaurants. Would go back. Expect to pay about 30 dollars a head."}
{"text":"Kobe Sizzlers has great specialty drinks. 

The meals have a good concept but gets very messy and hard to eat. The owner provided great service but unfortunately the food just wasn't all that great. Quality of meat was not very good. Heard a lot of good things about the brownie, wish I tried it!"}
{"text":"Came here with high hopes with having same sizzler I had 20 years back at Bombay Chowpati.. Totally disappointed with taste and presentation.. High on price but very disappointed with taste.. How could you serve Indian chicken marinated in Chinese style sauce???"}
{"text":"Amazing place for sizzler lovers, authentic flavour full Indian style,...,...... all kind of sizzler is available, as I am vegetarian, I had veggie ,paneer, paneer and cheese option with their signature schezwan sauce and sweet and sour sauce.,........ Tried both of them and both of them were  mouth watering...... Must Must  Must  Must Must try hot sizzling brownie with ice cream and Chocolate sauce.... It's die for..... One cannot resist this sinful dessert....  If you like review please give me thumbs up... :)"}
{"text":"Must try their brownie with pineapple sizzler dessert. I read the description and initially thought it would be horrible tasting. The foodie in me decided to give it a shot. I can't do justice in describing how it impacts your pallet. the pineapple slice lying under the brownie are a match made in heaven. I would've never guessed."}
{"text":"Good concept but terrible taste. I grew up in Mumbai and of course sizzlers there are at a whole different level ( can't be compared). 

My family of 9 came for dinner on a Saturday evening and the place was packed, which seems good for a restaurant but the space was pretty tight, my dad and my hubby had to get up at least 4-5 times to accommodate people at other table. This place felt way too congested, hot, not to mention that the ventilation is HORRIBLE!!!! Our clothes, hair and all our belongings stunk of food after! This is a turn off right off the bat for us- initially food smell is appetizing but after not so much! 

Food- ok tasting, I would give 3 stars as my hubby ordered meat sampler and asked for medium but it was way over cooked when it arrived. 

Service- except for a male server, female servers were horrible and every time we asked for something, they would take the order and not come back ( happened to us 4 times). We asked for water jug to be refilled at least 4 times....and yet like any other greedy place they charged you 10% service charge up ahead!!! I would give 2.5 stars for this. 

Price- I would say bit overpriced for quality of food and service. 

Alcohol- FYI only mock tails 

Needless to say, we are not returning. It didn't feel like we  were missing out on anything special."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time after being recommended by a friend. the place was small and quaint with nice decor and kept very clean. 

the customer service was very good and we were very well taken care of even after one our children had a bit of an accident. they immediately cleaned up the area and were very polite about it, and accommodated us to take care of our child.

The food was tasteful and definitely a cool experience
 the food came out very hot and sizzling (hence the name). there was just enough spice and flavour and the steak was cooked just as we had it asked it to be. the side dishes were also well cooked and tasty. Had the Pina colada drinks and have to say those were also very well made. 

overall, it was a great experience. A suggestion would be to perhaps expand a little to accommodate larger groups and softer lighting so it gives the feel of a fine dine restaurant ."}
{"text":"So here is a candid review of this place:
The best Items on the menu were the chicken club sandwich and the chicken lollipop appetizer.

The corn and the hot & sour soups seemed to be like curries more than soup. Couldn't even finish my bowl on my own. No good
Then let's come to the sizzlers..: what a disappointment.
Ordered their most popular(from what they told me) kobe chicken sizzler .... what a waste of money
It seemed like they just piled a bunch of food on the plate. It didn't even look appetizing, what to talk about taste.
The mashed potatoes were clearly out of a frozen bag. In fact everything tasted like it came out of a frozen bag, and was reheated and served. No good.
I mean if you have a pellet for good quality food, this is not the place for you. 

The service was good. They were polite and courteous.
Pricing was ok too."}
