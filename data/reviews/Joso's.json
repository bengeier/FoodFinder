{"text":"Hands down the best seafood I've had in Toronto, and I've grown on the Mediterranean with an abundance of freshly caught seafood. Seafood is cooked very simply, the way it's supposed to be (no fancy dressings, etc.)
Decoration is funky, and adds a fun touch to the experience. Apparently, the owner's dad was the artist that brought \"the breast\" to Toronto (the women's breast that is). Check it out!"}
{"text":"Joso's definitely offers a unique dining experience. We always drove past it's beautiful patio and always wanted to try it. On our visit we were seated inside, very interesting decor all around will entertain you until your food comes. The menu is pricey but I would say worth the experience. You can pick and chose different things on the menu as you like. Staff is very helpful in making suggestions and extremely professional. 

The only negative for me was the smell of seafood. I know its asking for too much since this is a seafood restaurant but I hate the smell of fish while waiting to eat, it's kinda unappetizing for me."}
{"text":"Honestly, I do not understand the hype around this restaurant. I mean unless one is going there for the atmosphere, it just doesn't make sense. The food is sub-par, unimpressive and bland. I had the fish and octopus and I noticed nothing spectacular for the prices they charge. The pasta was just horrible, completely inedible and sloppily plated. The only redeeming quality was that the pasta was al dente. The squid ink pasta smelled like rotting seafood and tasted \"off.\" The server had made this suggestion and failed to mention that this dish is somewhat of an \"acquired\" taste; to put it mildly. She also failed to mention that this dish would stain one's teeth and lips black. Ultimately, this restaurant is pretentious for no good reason, really."}
{"text":"It's hard to forget about Joso's. Maybe it's the food, but I think it has more to do with the d√©cor. The walls are decorated with pictures, paintings and statues of nude women, so make sure you prepare your guests so they don't think they walked into the wrong building. 

The seafood here is fantastic. The octopus in particular is just outstanding and I can easily say it's the best I've had in the city (sorry Bar Isabel). It was actually so good that we got another order of it. We had the Nero risotto which was also super tasty.

They bring out a platter of the fresh seafood to your table so you can take a look at what is available for ordering that day. If you're going to order a full grilled fish, be sure to confirm the price because this could easily hike up your bill. Personally I would pass on grilled fish, as I tend to prefer steamed fish. 

Joso's is a little bit pricey, so make sure you prep your wallet if you go dine at Joso's."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed given the reviews both online and word of mouth for this place. We ordered calamari, and two fresh fish dishes. Loved the presentation and that you can see and pick your fish, but very bland and over priced. The restaurant itself is cluttered and seating was very tight. Service was decent, but nothing to write home about. If I go back I'll make sure to try the squid ink pasta as this is what people seem to be raving about"}
{"text":"Favourite seafood joint in Toronto. Admittedly, quite expensive but great quality. Fun decoration (warning: nuditity!!!!!!!!).
Black ink squid pasta is my fav."}
{"text":"I always find time for this jewel, food excellent staff friendly and a very enjoyable way to spend an evening. Very reasonably priced for what it is. Treat yourself and go."}
{"text":"My bf actually took me there for my birthday... the food was okay, so for the over priced amount that they were charging.... NOT WORTH IT! And the SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE... instead of them singing that happy bithday song for me with the desert... they sang to the next table as we were eating our appetizer. The girl at the table was so confused. The girl, her boyfriend and the staff were asking around for my name. And to top it off, they actually took the time to check which table and they announced that it was suppose to be for me... thanks for the embarrassing experience and NO I would not like my desert now... I told the couple they can have that desert. My bf was fuming... that I had to calm him down!!! For spending $300 and be embarrassed like that... NEEDLESS TO SAY, NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They actually deserve a NEGATIVE 5 STARS."}
{"text":"My boss decided to bring me here once with our coworkers from Europe and I was blown away. This is a true Fish/Seafood restaurant away from the sea. 
The way that they present the fish to preparing it is amazing. 
I brought my GF and brother that is from out of town here to celebrate his Birthday and had a great experience. They explain every fish, seafood and wine to you in detail and will spend the time it takes to show you how to cut your fish once it arrives to the table.  
This is not only a meal but a great experience"}
{"text":"As soon as the plane lands in Toronto I always remember first thing is to call Joso's to reserve my fav fish, Scorpion, which is from Croatia.  I love the Leonardo pasta and black ink.  My husband and I ate here 2x a day for 5 days straight and he had fish soup for appetizer and as for his dessert.  We got  upset when we found out they close on Sunday.  Daily fresh made tiramisu which I never missed to order to complete my meal every single time.  And exquisite arts on the walls! Every where we travel we brag about Joso's and I think it is our best restaurant ever.  Too bad Leo doesn't want to branch out to Vancouver.  We'll see you soon in few days!"}
{"text":"Had the squid ink pasta and black mouth fish. Simply prepared and very delicious! Would definitely come back and try the risotto."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the staff were lovely. We had the oysters, a few pastas, the calamari and the mussels and clams. The food was excellent but the noodles were all a little too oily. Atmosphere is quirky, and interesting. I brought my son and he was a little uncomfortable with the large volume of nude photographs and pictures, but he didn't complain once!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a restaurant to remember. 
The first thing that you will notice is the decor, which is a mixture of erotic and nautical themes. If you are a zen minimalist, you probably won't appreciate the wall to wall, what I like to call, \"creative clutter\".  I can only imagine that each piece has it's own history. Interestingly enough, much of the displayed art was produced by Joso himself! 
As for the food, we ordered the Nero risotti, the Scorpion fish and the Clams, Muscles and Shrimp in tomato sauce. Everything was EXCELLENT!! The large plate of Nero, which is visually interesting due to the infused black cuttlefish ink, was very rich and flavourful. The Scorpion fish was exquisite - despite being an frequent fish eater, I have never tasted fish like this before; sweat, moist and, oddly enough, not fishy.  The clam dish was deliciously fresh. 
The service was wonderful - very attentive and friendly. Before ordering, they bring out an amazing display of fresh, uncooked seafood and describe the taste and quality of each piece. 
The only \"negative\" remark is that the menu is quite expensive. However, given the quality of the food and service, I didn't feel ripped off in any way. Joso's is simply a restaurant that you reserve for special occasions.   
Joso's is a true gem and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to treat their special someone to an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"The food was up to par with the best I've had.  Out of four dishes I ordered, four were excellent.  My favourite was the squid ink pasta.  It was heavenly.  I love art and enjoyed Joso's artwork very much.  The place was FILLED with it!  It was a delight to visit a restaurant which merged my two loves, art and eating.   Service was good and the wait staff  did well at everything their job entails:   Explaining the menu, taking my order, bringing the orders etc. They seemed knowledgable regarding  Joso and his art, which was very nice to see.  During dinner, patrons ask and I enjoyed listening in.   

It's a minor detail but it does make a difference in the overall dining experience:  I feel the waitress and busser lacked warmth.  Their feet were probably tired or hurting and it's busy, and I'm not expecting them to flash fake smiles or anything- that would be worse, but I've had better. They did everything \"right\" but I can tell  they would much rather be at home watching TV or whatever.  With the brown haired busser, it was a case of \"It's not what you say, it's how you say it\".   The tall, beautiful waitress was nice enough.  

In any industry, many veterans get jaded, while others become more polished with time.  This applies to the two male hosts (one behind the counter - maybe bartender?) at Joso's.  Even if they'd rather be home watching TV, I can't tell, and this is the difference between good and great. Another minor detail:  A few ladies were in the washroom partaking in substances of the *sniff sniff/snort snort* variety.  I have no moral stance on this issue but they were crowding the washroom and there for a long time, which I found slightly annoying.  Of course, this is not any of the staff's fault.

Other the minor detail I mentioned, this is an excellent establishment."}
{"text":"Joso's is, hands down, the best seafood restaurant in the city. While the prices are a little steep, it truly is the best quality that money can buy. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and it is all superb. Excellent service, gorgeous staff, and the decor--wow. Joso's is truly a feast for both the eyes and the stomach. I never want to eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"First time here at Joso's. We ordered the prosciuttos with cheese as appetizer followed up with the squid ink pasta and grilled fish (I forgot the name of the fish but it's from Portugal) for a dinner of two. Their squid ink pasta was very legit and delicious reminding me of the one I had at Venice. And the fish was grilled over the oven flame. It's seasoned with olive oil, salt and served with pepper and a drizzle of fresh lemon juice. Very tender, juicy and delicious. We also ordered a Chianti red wine from Italy. The wine was pretty good too. Nice place! Reminded me a lot of the Italian restaurants where I went at Venice and Cinque Terre."}
{"text":"Joso is quite the unique place.  The reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is the dessert we ordered was Gelato, and well it was really hard and icy-

Otherwise the food is unreal. If you like fish that is.  

Yummy cocktails, fresh, simply made (see salt and olive oil) fish, and a cozy, eclectic atmosphere.  

This place came highly recommended to me numerous times- I admit when I walked in, i was umm a little shocked.  The decor is a bit fromage, with sculptures and drawings of very curvy women.  Being a seafood and fish fanatic, I was very pleased with the food.  The grilled octopus is majorly yummy.

So, would I go back for the scene or ambiance?  No.  Nor the menu's creativity.  

Joso features fresh, exquisite fish. Simply made. 

Great date spot."}
{"text":"By far my favourite restaurant in the city. Yes it's pretty expensive but the food is out of this world! The decor is kind of odd; Mediterranean with naked statues inside but the little patio outside is quaint. I've also sat upstairs by the window which is a great spot as well. I've been coming here annually for my birthday dinner and it never disappoints. The service is always friendly, and the servers really know their menu and can speak to what each fish is like. 
We order the same appetizers each visit: the smoked trout (unbelievable), calamari, oysters and shrimp by the piece. The flavours are so good and fresh, I hate calamari but this is the only place I will eat it as it's not that rubbery texture you find at other places. The waitress greets you with a large dish of every type of whole fish you can imagine, all from different parts of the world and flavours. We always pick a different one every time to try. The fish is cooked whole with a little olive oil and salt so you really can taste the natural flavours of the fish. It's recommended to get the sides like vegetables and rice to go with your fish to make it a meal which are additional.
Every year this place doesn't disappoint, and worth every cent! So great for a romantic dinner with someone special or for an occasion."}
{"text":"Very interesting ambiance and choice of decor, not for the virgin eyes though. However, the food was delicious and satisfy all. We had the oysters (love them small, and far from fishy with a home made light cocktil sauce), the procuitto and cheese (a little dry though), the pasta and squid was delicious (was a little messy... left my lips and teeth dirty looking, so not ideal for dates but was worth it, next time I want to try the rosotto though), and for fresh fish picked the scorpion fish which was simply heavenly (grilled to perfection, light and far from fishy, which I can't stand). Great quirky place to wine and dine. Definately coming back. :)"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time last night. Overall favourable impression. Will go back to try new dishes next time."}
{"text":"Friend brought me here saying that Drake eats here. That wasn't really a convincing factor for me, but a nice FYI for those that don't know. The place itself is decorated in aqua themed art and naked people. The staff was very caring and informative. I had the scorpion fish, it was good and tender, but not mind blowing. This place is very pricey which makes sense if Drake eats here."}
{"text":"After reading many good reviews, my bf and i have decided to give it a try. And I have to say, I was a little disappointed. The services was good but the food...I expected a little more. Especially their \"secret ingredient\" squid ink pasta, I found it was overrated. We also ordered the grilled octopus which is literally 3 grilled tentacles that were over cook and the grilled octopus costed us $39. I think I can find better seafood restaurants with a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"Food was average in taste and presentation.
Wait service was attentive and friendly - no problems there.

I think the food is overpriced for what you get.

NOTE : you must pay extra for your sides (rice, veggies) - see online menu.

The interior decor was a mish-mash/collision of knick-knacks, pictures and paintings - some of a sexual nature.

The music was not my kind of dining music."}
{"text":"This is my favourite seafood restaurant.  With being croatian myself, I appreciate a lot of the menu.  It's an excellent dining experience and has a fun, quirky atmosphere.  

Fresh fish flown in from the Adriatic daily makes the restaurant.  This is some of the best grilled fish you will ever have.  The scorpion fish is a personal favourite of mine.

Be prepared to have a pretty hefty bill but it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Best Seafood downtown Toronto. Hands Down. Definitely recommend as a solid date place."}
{"text":"A favorite in Toronto. Entertaining atmosphere and wonderful food."}
{"text":"Have always loved Josos. Great ambiance, service and food. 

I've tried almost everything on their menu and it's great. Fresh fish, seafood pasta, squid pasta, oysters, etc. You can't go wrong. 

Service - 5
Food - 5
Ambiance -5
Price to value -4.5

Definitely recommend. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great place with variety of food, deferentially a unique place,Squid ink pasta is something to try. Loved it."}
{"text":"Decoration is unique. Very good taste! Best choice for seafood! If you want seafood you must have to be Joso's!"}
{"text":"Having fond memories of coming to Joso's as a child with my family, I was incredibly pleased to come back after nearly 20 years and still find the restaurant in great shape and cooking wonderful food.

My colleague and I both ordered fish off the platter, and it was prepared beautifully and cooked to perfection. Our starter salads were great as well.  And the wine selection was an unusual and interesting one.  

Finally, the service.  The service was truly impeccable. Attentive, helpful and personal, without being overbearing.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Eclectic room by a mile. Some of the fish can be pricey BUT no better grilled fish anywhere. Leonardo pasta is a dish I have to order everytime I go there"}
{"text":"Joso's has been one of my favorite restaurants since I first went there 3 years ago. Best calamari in Toronto! And if that is all you are ordering, the price is under $30. Excellent service with a  staff that knows their stuff."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I knew my experience at Joso's would be like no other. The unique decor had us looking around and getting lost in the artwork on the way to getting our seats. 

The servers come to every table and show you what fish is available on that day. All the staff is very knowledgable about what the restaurant has to offer. 

The taste of the fish was absolutely amazing. The best fish I have ever had so far. Very classic fish with simple sides - potato salad, Swiss chard. 

There is not one bad thing I can say about Joso's. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! The food was delicious.  I will definitely return back here to eat again.  Everyone is so friendly and attentive.  Nice cozy place to dine in  or out on their front patio or upstairs  I ordered the shrimp with marinara and rice and my husband ordered the octopus with beets.  We were impressed on how delicious everything tasted."}
{"text":"The service is impeccable. They have mastered sexy with their servers. Provocative art is present all over this cozy seafood spot. Pasta is great for the veg diners. A great spot for a romantic dinner for 2 or for small groups maybe up to 10. Reservations likely required. Honestly, all restaurants should strive to have the same level of service and quality. Not cheap but worth it."}
{"text":"Masterful fresh fish flown in every day, great ambiance, all while surrounded by various artwork celebrating genetalia.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 6. Had the grilled octopus, some butterflied shrimps, Nero, Joso's spaghettini,  steamed Swiss chard, Beets, Basmati rice, and as for fish we had two types of Sole.  One from Holland and one from Portugal.  The scorpion fish and one more fish I can't remember which one. The fish was grilled over an open flame in the typical Dalmatian style.  The prices range from about 40-200 or so.  Everything was delicious!  Dip the bread in the garlic and olive oil the octopus came in. Soo good.  The bill with wine came to about 800.  I would return, but I'm not a big fan of fish.  Although the scorpion fish was my favourite out of the 4 ordered."}
{"text":"I will give 3 stars because of the overpriced food.

Let me tell you something.

I lived in the Mediterranean quite a lot of time to develop a good palate on fresh fish and seasoning, the proper one, simple and light..

Josos grill the fish beautiful but do not get me wrong, you can not just sell a scorpion fish for 65 dollar. That is beyond making handsome profit. (I have tasted fish as good as this for less than half the price in St. Lawrence market)

The octopus, not so tender. Greektown has a grilled octopus at the pair of this restaurant half the price.

The sea salad.. meh... very rustic, not very pleasant.

The squid pasta was good, nothing exceptional.

Maybe I am a hard reviewer, but when it comes to seafood I am very picky. 

In few words I would play 15-20% less for the menu items.

Service, decent.

Vibe, upscale, not exactly genuinely alluring.

Times for the food, regular considering we were the only table.

Would I come back, yes if I get a sugar mama!. .. lol"}
{"text":"This place is special. Really special. For a bustling city like Toronto, you know something has to be good if it has lasted as long as Joso's has. My boyfriend and I visited Joso's during our Canada Day/4th of July trip from DC. We had an early reservation because we went to Second City after (another Toronto must!) I had done some research prior to our trip and saw Joso's was highly rated for seafood. I also saw they were owned by a Croatian family. I'm part Serbian so I tend to feel drawn to places like this. As other reviews state, the artwork is very eclectic! We were warmly welcomed as soon as we entered. We started with a half dozen oysters as we were presented with the fish platter. I had never seen anything like this before but it was amazing to see what the fresh selection was that day. We decided early on that we wanted to do the seafood risotto and we were warned not to load up on appetizers. As we sat sipping our wine, several tables filled up and all of them were regulars who knew everyone else. This place was full of characters which made it that much more enjoyable to visit. You were practically treated like family. Our seafood risotto was impeccable. Clams, shrimp, calamari, mussels. I am picky about my risotto - it needs a good base, a good sauce. The sauce with this risotto was a delicious tomato-based sauce but not too heavy. It was probably the best seafood risotto I've ever had. We almost polished the entire bowl off (and it can feed four people!) This is a special place worth visiting and returning to. At one point, my boyfriend said it felt like we were in someone's living room. Charming and lovely."}
{"text":"I very like their Siciliana. It is quite hard to find anywhere else with the same quality. The pasta was cooked al dente, and the cuttlefish ink is quite fresh and tasty.

I have to say their seafood is quite fresh, and the waitress is willing to take out their selection of fish for the customers to look at. The decorations in the restaurant are quite unique because of their statues and pictures. I very love their decorations. The waitresses are friendly and very knowledgeable about their food and wine selections. I will go back again to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"It was $300 for some fish I could have fried better at home. Luckily my friend enjoyed it, but I didn't find the price tag worth what I got.

Don't go unless someone else is paying, like your boss. I found the fish cooked but way too oily, and the service was kind of lackluster. They ignored us until it was time to pay the bill and then they came over fawning."}
{"text":"I spent my birthday dinners and my anniversary days there. Intimate vibe and classy decoration."}
{"text":"I don't frequent Joso's often, but when I went there this past Saturday, I told myself it should be a regular haunt for me. The thing is, the seating is just so darned tight. I hate the downstairs level, and the second floor is marginally better, but I guess all in the name of atmosphere.

The food is, spectacular. No doubt about it. It's a great place to go with a group of people so you can order everything and share. Yes, the Risotto Nero is a must order. It's dark richness, with the rice being the perfect gooe-y consistency is heavenly. 

I was there celebrating, and we started with Champagne and Oysters. Then, we actually changed things around by having our main course (fish first) than the Risotto as the dish takes some time to come out. We all had fish: Scorpio, Sea Bass, Sea Breem (sp?), Octopus, and Dover Sole. Each fish was cooked to perfection.

Than the Risotto - omg. 

For dessert, we still had enough room for Tiramisu and this Crepe dish (actual name eludes me) but it was okay. Very sweet apricot jam inside cold crepes. I could have passed on that one.

Our wine choice was a lovely and sweet Pinot Noir which complemented the entire meal just perfect.

Joso's is definitely a special occasion place. Reservations are a definite must. Our table, when making reservations, was told we had to be out by 9:30 (to account for their two time seating). So, with a reservation at 6:30, is that enough time? We left just at 9:27pm which included lengthy conversation. So, it is not a rush.

Joso's is a great place to take out of town guests - the d√©cor inside the building, as everyone mentions, is certainly unique."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Joso's. It's my first choice for special occasions. I'm a huge seafood lover and this is by far the best seafood in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here last month for dinner and we loved the food. Upon arriving, we were greeted by the overwhelming number of naked female pictures all across the restaurant. Yes, that is the vibe of this restaurant- \"Feast for the eyes, ears, and mouth\". 

We ordered oysters, market fish, and the Nero risotto and loved all 3. The waitress literally brought out all the available fish out to our table to show us. Helped with our selection for sure. Because, we also ordered the risotto it was a lot of food. Heads up, the risotto alone can feed 3 people.

Now let's talk about the Nero Risotto. Yes, it's a blank cuttlefish ink risotto and yes it does look a bit intimidating to eat. But don't let the deep black colour fool you, the risotto is amazing! It does stain your teeth and lips, so have a glass of white wine ready ;). Looking back, we realized we should've ordered the risotto and the oysters and called it a day. Adding the market fish was too much for 2 people to eat. 

Overall, we loved it here. Goes to show you, don't judge a book by its cover (referring to the sensual vibe of this place and the blank ink risotto)."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the atmosphere here.  It reminded us a little bit of Boba (really miss that place!).  The service started out excellent but did wane a little bit as the evening wore on and the place got busier.  The food was good.  The hubs ordered the whole arctic char, lightly seasoned, and thought it was delicious.  The grilled shrimp were excellent.  Decent wine list.  Dinner for two including a glass of wine each and dessert was around $200 with tip.  Yep, we'd go back."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

You can enjoy fresh seafood meal. Inside restaurant, is full of arts, its like in museum. Photos show that many famous people visit there."}
{"text":"Service is first class. Ambiance and decor is great. I ordered the market fish it was delicious, the oysters and appetizer salad were nothing spectacular. A great and memorable experience but not enough to bring me back wanting more."}
{"text":"Joso's. *Dreamy sigh*

Seafood has been for some time now my \"safe\" dish, as in the dish I will order when all else fails. But Joso's brings it to a whole new level. I now understand why Drake sings about this place; it inspires tribute. This place is not cheap (expect $50 each at minimum), but it manages to be so good, you still get more than what you paid for.

First off, I knew it was going to be a good night when the seafood soup (with lovely morsels of white fish) was delicious. Best I ever had (Drake pun!). This is also the first time I've seen a resto pull off a tomato-based broth that wasn't an overpriced and embellished version of minestrone. A-mazing.

For fish we got the Portuguese sole, and I was again blown away by Joso's ability to do something better than your imagination could. Grilled and seasoned to perfection, I literally do not think this could have been better done. 

The risotto as many people have said is also quite good, and the squid ink sauce is both intriguingly novel and delicious. Perhaps not my favourite dish here though (for an Asian, I'm not overly fond of rice), and I think that my stomach space would have been better used sampling more fish. It's also worth noting that the portion size is huge, and although it's supposed to serve 2-4, I really think that 4 is the minimum if you don't want the risotto to be your entire meal. 

Overall, amazing. The service was lovely and the ambiance was sensual but classy, but the food is what I will dream of. I will be back whenever my wallet permits."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great! Very unique eclectic decor coupled with oldies music my grandparents would have probably listened too. But that didn't other us at all, it added to the unique experience.

Food is very fresh and flavorful, downside was everything was over dressed with olive oil. The food is over priced for the portion sizes . We ordered the arugula salad , which was probably 1/4 the size of any large chain restaurant , a half order of calamari, pasta dish and a grilled fish. The bill ended up being 220 dollars , definitely not the best value.

Service was fantastic, servers were very attentive and helpful with explaining the menu."}
{"text":"Let's face it, when someone writes a review it is either to rave about a job well done or to do the complete opposite. I am not one to write a review however this is completely necessary after the experience my boyfriend and I had. From start to finish it was awful. My one star rating is for the food and really, it is fresh beautiful seafood, other than over cooking it how can you really screw that up? Food was good, not spectacular. 
My boyfriend took me to Joso's for my birthday, we were both looking forward to the Joso's experience, ambiance and food after reading countless fantastic reviews. From the moment we stepped foot inside felt unwelcomed. We we're standing at the front of the restaurant for what felt like 10 minutes (reading some other 1 star reviews this is not uncommon) and we're not looked at once by any of the circulating staff. When we we're finally greeted we gave the name the reservation was under and asked to be seated on the patio, the gentleman mentioned he needed to check the I-pad. He then proceeded to say go ahead and pick any table you like, no escort, that is fine, this was the least of our worries by the end of our experience.  
Once seated we were greeted by the first of 3  extremely rude female servers. Number 1, there should not be more than 1 server tending to your table unless the second is to drop off food, let alone 3 people. Each server was rude, made you feel awkward, unwelcomed and question decisions made.  
We had a chance to review the menu (keep in mind this was for a birthday, we we're well aware that this was going to be a splurge, one we did not mind whatsoever) and made our meal decisions. We planned to order the Insalata di mare to start (shared) and the Leonardo pasta dish( shared) followed by Calamari Griglia and Grilled Octopus. The first server greeted us, offered to show us the fish selection for the evening I kindly declined and let her know we had decided on our order. My boyfriend proceeded to order the appetizer and said we would place the mains order once finished (we wanted to take our time and enjoy.) The server blatantly laughed at our decision and said \"ok\" we we're EXTREMELY thrown off and couldn't understand the need to laugh (we felt she was implying it was not enough.) We we're ready to order the bottle of wine that interested us but needed a minute to process this awkward moment. The second server then greeted us, we let her know which wine we wanted, she brought it out a few minutes later poured into each of our glasses then went inside with the bottle. We are in Yorkville, chill the wine table-side, don't make guests wait 10 minutes+ for a refill and question whether the bottle has been finished or not!
The third server then plated our appetizer, it was good, small portion and nothing to rave about.
The second server then came back to clear the plate and ask if we wanted to see the fish selection, we let her know we had already said we we're not interested but she insisted as this was part of the Joso's experience (we then caved because anything to brighten this so far odd experience would have helped.)
The first server then came back and asked if we we're ready to order, we ordered the grilled Calamari and Octopus, opted out of the pasta because we we're so turned off by the service we just wanted to try this famous fish and get out of there. 
The food came relatively quickly and it was very good, grilled nicely and not over dressed, very fresh tasting. Once we finished our meals and wine we were asked by our first server what we would like to order next. I let her know we we're ok and would just like the bill, she then laughed (AGAIN) and said \"what about a desert menu\" I repeated myself and said \"we are ok can we please just have the bill?\" She then sent the second server to our table WITH DESERT MENUS, she placed them down and walked away. That same server came back an asked what we had decided on for desert I had then repeat myself for a third time and say \"can.we.just.have.the.bill.PLEASE\" she then walked away grabbed the terminal, set it down on our table and WALKED AWAY, she didn't just walk away to give us privacy with the terminal, she walked into the restaurant and was in there for so long that we processed our own payment and did not even see her before we left.
 I cannot put into any more words than I already have how terrible our experience was, the food we did eat we could not even enjoy because of how turned off we we're. Word of advice to the public, if you are not a celebrity and can't get yourself on that wall, don't bother showing your face in here, there are plenty of beautiful restaurants in the city that can serve you seafood just as good if not better accompanied by PROPER SERVICE! Word of advice to the owner, manager and all staff at Joso's, FIX THIS PROBLEM. This is a fine dining restaurant, there should be fine dining service to follow! Each customer should be treated the same!!!"}
{"text":"Really solid seafood and italian food - I loved the calamari and octopus (so many other places have a rubbery texture). The pastas and risottos are rich and flavourful without being heavy and oily. Attentive service. I would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"A superb dining experience! Excellent attentive and knowledgeable staff. The seafood was fresh and cooked to perfection. Love the Erotic art and Poseidon theme decor. Don't let any narrow minded people pressure you into changing your roots, it's what makes this place a unique experience. Oysters, grilled octopus and fish, basmati rice, grilled peppers, wine, tiramisu, and espresso.....my kind of celebration of food and life. Well done!"}
{"text":"Went there with two of my frineds on Thursday night. The menu is designed very classy, and the interior decoration is really attractive. We went there for Siciliana which is a spaghettini made of cuttlefish and its ink. Every dish was delicious and the dining experience was very good. There is no free parking nor a large parking lot, street parking only."}
{"text":"Amazing for special occasions.  Feels like you've just stepped into a tiny European restaurant.  Loved the ambience, imitate but still had energy.  Service was good, the food was really good.  Drink was very good too, good selection of cocktails.  Wanted to order more but didn't want to sell my organs to afford it."}
{"text":"I went to Josos's with my family last weekend. There are 2 seatings, 630 pm and 930pm, and the place was PACKED. 630 felt a bit early, but once we arrived and ate a long, leisurely dinner I understood why they do this.  
Make a reservation if you want to eat at Joso's! 

Joso's is known for having fresh seafood and many say it's as close to a European seafood place as you will find in Toronto. The server comes out with a platter of pre- cooked fish and tells you about each piece, which is a nice touch, though a bit of an information over load. The fish are cooked simply with salt and lemon and the outcome is fantastic!

We had: 
The grilled octopus - OMG get this! SIMPLY AMAZING! tender and perfectly seasoned. 

The smoked trout - if you like smoked fish, get this!

Oysters - YES

The Branzino - this fish is served whole on the bone. I ate it with ease, very little bone got in the way. the flavour was incredible, flaky and light, not at all fishy. 

The Cod- very rich and tasty.

Lamb chops - tasty, but I suggest getting fish here. 

Deep fried Calamari and octopus - this comes with a marinera sauce, not tzatsiki. Just thought I'd mention it, as my brother was a bit disappointed.

The Risotto with the mushrooms - This was a bit disappointing. The menu boasts their risottos take 25 minutes to prepare, and the price is not cheap. However in my opinion the risotto was nothing special and tasted like it had been made with cream of mushroom soup. Everyone at the table ate it, though no one wanted to take home the leftovers. In fact, this review is four stars because of the risotto. 

For desert we had a small creme brule and chocolate mousse. it was my birthday and they turned the lights out and made the entire floor of the restaurant join them in singing happy birthday. Nice touch. 

Joso's has been around for decades, which is reflected in the decor. Every inch of the walls are covered with memorabilia of celebrities who dined there, and fishing related stuff. It's not trendy or chic, but if you're going somewhere with your family, Joso's is an excellent choice. The food is tasty, and the service is prompt."}
{"text":"Seafood and sex: a natural pairing.

Yes the breast-filled decor is kitsch as most people know, but the fresh seafood will win you over and the knickknacks and oddities create a fun atmosphere.

Love the spaghettini Leonardo (al dente pasta tossed with diced octopus and shrimp with parsley, lemon, garlic, capers and white wine) and the insalate di mare (oil-poached monkfish, grilled octopus and sweet shrimp tossed in oil and lemon, brightened with rosemary, bay leaves, red wine vinegar and capers). 

I found the risotto to be a bit too heavy for me. 

The top-quality fish on the platter (selected from around the world) looks and smells as good as everyone says.  

I think they have some of the best grilled calamari and octopus that I've tasted in the city."}
{"text":"This place is a gem - a throwback to cozy dining establishments of the 60s that really delivered some seriously good food.
The decor is amusingly eclectic (the owner obviously has a thing for big breasts) but it definitely adds to the atmosphere.
Service is friendly and very professional.
This place is all about seafood served fresh, served Mediterranean style - as simply as possible to allow the natural flavours to shine. Before ordering we were presented with a platter of the days' fresh fish options to help us choose - beats a tiny picture on a menu! We started with the adria salad, which is a nice, light version of the classic house salad. Then we had the Octopus Schiavona, which might have been the best dish of the night - fantastic! Tender octopus, steamed with capers, olives and celery to enhance the beautiful flavour, this was perfectly reminiscent of dishes from my childhood. Then we had the clams, mussels and shrimp buzara - really nice, simple dish so you can taste the seafood in all its glory. The grilled calamari was also terrific - perfectly cooked, nicely seasoned to enhance and not overpower the natural squid flavour. On the side we had the stewed vegetables, which was a curious and tasty kind of Croatian ratatouille.
The wine list is small but very well thought out so you will find your match there.
My only regret is not having the space to order more!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Nothing inventive. Fresh fish. Very very expensive. I understand the art with all the boobs is suppose to be kitschy but I'm not sure I like the protrayal of women when waitresses are dressed with as much cleavage as possible. I didn't expect that in a family looking business."}
{"text":"My new most favourite seafood restaurant. A bit pricy but worth every dollar. Let's start with appetizers, Insalata di mare was amazing. Still feeling the moistness and flavour in my mouth. Squid ink risotto (Nero) was too good. It was huge (good for atleast 2 hungry persons, even 3 can share) Also got to know they have half portions available. Tiramisu was really soft and delicious and really complements the after effects of the beautiful fish taste. Service was quite attentive. Lastly the ambience was awesome. Beautiful pieces of art really provides you with a lovely eating experience (some people find it a bit questionable though). Will definitely go there again and will go there again soon."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is good. Service very attentive and environment intimate. Clientele mixed, yet they all wear dress shirts.
There is no doubt this is a fish/sea food place all of which are excellent.
With a couple of bottles of wine , do not be surprised at a bill in the order of $400 for two."}
{"text":"A diamond on the rough? i think not! This cozy little treasure is nestled in nicely along Davenport, West of Avenue Rd. This place is easy to miss but hard to forget. To begin, the decor was spectacular, even if you're not an art fan you have to appreciate the beauty of each hand made piece of art. Each piece was made by the owner or gifted to him by someone he knows. The seafood was amazing, grilled perfectly as it should be. We ordered a seafood sampler platter, it's not on the menu but they catered to our request and let us select what we wanted to try. They have a wide assortment of fresh fish from around the world. The service was truly great, our waitress was very knowledegable and attentive. Make sure to save room for desert, all thier deserts are home made by a couple of Portuguese ladies and the Tiramisu was to die for. Prices are a little steep but the experience will leave you on a high. Do book ahead or you may not get in."}
{"text":"Can I tell you how much I love Joso's squid ink pasta ( spaghetti al nero di seppia)???  Mi piace da matti!! Buonissimo!! It's da bomb!! Squid ink pasta has always been my favorite pasta but it's really hard to find a place that even makes it. I was so psyched when I discovered this place, it really made my day!!  And I love the tacky over the top decor( but it was slightly disturbing.... You will know why if you go there, lol), such a fun place!!! The ambiance alone is worth checking out, you won't find anything like it in Toronto ( or anywhere else). The unique artsy decor and fantastic seafood will surely continue to attract even celebrities, as it has already been frequented by many famous stars. A must visit in Toronto! 

P.S. - this place isn't cheap but it's worth splurging!"}
{"text":"Squid ink pasta and fresh grilled fish are  their signature items, highly recommend to try.  Overall, average dining experience. Diners most are their long term customers. They kinda knew each other in the neighborhood. 
Service can be improved and needs standardization. Servers vary. I cannot give five stars because It was odd when our server brought over raw fishes which we was not informed beforehand. And she kept touching those raw fishes and showing to us at a limited space on the table.  The place is too small to fit for all tables, the space between each table in my opinion ,is too close. If you would like a quiet and private dinner party time, this is something you should consider . You hear what others say from the next table.
Decor is cozy and artistic, we went there because uniqueness and artworks and fresh fish from worldwide. We enjoyed our dinner"}
{"text":"Someone special took me here :)
Other than it being made famous by rapper Drake in his 5a.m in toronto lyrics, it was really good.
Sexy atmosphere, good seafood, nice dimly lit communal almost seating.
Service was not amazing.
Remember I said communal dining. I sat upstairs and a couple was basically at our table. Very close, tight spaces.
Decor is interesting - could be deemd artistic or just too crowded. 
Had calamari. It was great. I wont say this is the best seafood place, as I really love Adega."}
{"text":"Like this place needs to get busier--it's already very difficult to get a reservation!

Come here if you like seafood. Everything is fresh, and the servers know what they're doing. They bring around a plate of the catch du jour and tell you all about the fish and their origins. Fantastic.

We usually get one or two items from the catch du jour, some grilled calamari, and the seafood salad. The squid ink pasta is pretty good too.

Very sexy atmosphere. This is a great date place. I actually didn't notice the art was of a sensual nature until my second visit."}
{"text":"The seafood was very fresh, the service was flawless and the ambience could not be more fun. Joso's has held up over time from all accounts, and I enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for a taste of Italy. My favourite dishes would be the Milanese risotto (portion is huge- would feed 6). The dish was super creamy and flavourful. The squid ink pasta was delish as well. I would recommend ordering that in the pasta form rather than risotto as the risotto portion is huge. With squid ink pasta, I feel like you can't eat too much of it as the longer you wait the more fishy it gets. Lastly we tried the market seafood. I loved the fish the most !! It was tender and baked to perfection. Seasoned very well. I would also recommend the octopus tentacles and would probably pass on the shrimp and calamari for the market seafood. 

The place is very small, would recommend to reserve!"}
{"text":"Awesome, eclectic decor in this great restaurant. We ordered a number of dishes and shared for our group of 4. Nothing disappointed. We ordered 2 whole fish, octopus, pasta w octopus, and oysters. Everything was very fresh, perfectly cooked and close to one of the best seafood restaurants that I have eaten in. I will definitely go again when I'm in Toronto"}
{"text":"My friend took me there for my birthday.  I have to say that I was a little surprised by the interior decor. 
We ordered a bottle of great wine and I was so impressed by the food. We order a whole grilled fish. It was fresh, clean, soft, and exquisite. 
Lastly, the service was excellent. Our server was helpful, accommodating, and not pushy at all."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that makes me want to return to Toronto.  We enjoy Toronto but we like other places to visit as well.  N.Y.C or Portland, Oregon for example. Returning to a great city is wonderful and you revisit the best places and explore new ones.  This is a return visit.  Now if you are from the US Bible Belt the art and decorations may put you off but the service was excellent, the space cozy and the seafood the star attraction.  The chef knew when to make a dish wonderful and when to let a great fish shine without overdoing the treatment."}
{"text":"Eclectic is definitely the word to use when describing the decor.  There are plenty of nudes of various types on the wall in this cosy seafood restaurant.  The atmosphere is light and the dining room is not very loud.  Perfect for a romantic dinner although you are sitting elbow to elbow with your neighbors.  Because I didn't have a reservation I was stuck at the front counter which turned out for me at least to be the best seat of the house because it was a great spot to people watch and take in all the ambiance.  More on this later.

As a starter, I had a grilled calamari.  Very nice and tasty.  A little heavy on the char for me but I still enjoyed it very much as the flesh of the calamari itself was not over cooked.  

For my main course I had the grilled \"guraz\", spelling?  And it was perfect.  Simple preparation and execution.  I even liked my basmati rice side which as it turns out had a pinch of salt and garlic butter.  Simple and effective as it matched the fish perfectly.  

I was very satisfied with my meal and was ready to settle up when the hostess offered me a free dessert on the account that they did not have seating for and I had to sit at \"the bar\":).  This was not needed since I thought the food and service up till now was near perfect but pushed my rating to a five.  For a restaurant to give something extra based solely on their dedication to complete customer satisfaction is so refreshing in the world of pop up eateries and trendy gimmicks.  

This is truly a neighborhood treasure that according to the hostess has been around for 40 years.  Here is to 40 more!! Great job."}
{"text":"Oh Joso's, what are you?  From the pictures of celebrity-patrons (Mariah Carey, Springsteen, De Niro, Kate Hudson, etc.), you seem like a VIP-only establishment that requires reservations weeks in advance and a special connection to get past a velvet rope.  But, no, you're down-to-earth and don't play difficult-to-get with your reservations (though reservations are recommended).  From the photographs and paintings of women (and the occasional man) in stages of undress lining the walls and from the boudoir red color of the establishment, I would expect Hugh Hefners in silk pajamas smoking Cubans in the corner.  But instead I see a very mixed crowd of couples and families and friends.  And I worry that the ostentatious decor hides sub-par food, but, no, the food is amazing.  From the simple yet fresh goat-cheese salad, to the creamy and delicious risotto prepared with sepia (squid) and its ink, to the mousse and creme brulee that were perfectly sweetened, my taste buds were pleased.  Joso's is a treat for the senses."}
{"text":"A great experience. From the moment you walk in, the red artistic ambience has you. Greeted by friendly service in a cozy warm setting.
Ink squid pasta and a fresh fish presentation are some of the specialties this place has to offer. The food was prepared to perfection, offering flavourful and unique dishes like Siciliana, Leanardo and their incredible Risotto options. All fish is fresh and no shortage of options.
Will return."}
{"text":"Great Place, Great decor, and amazing seafood.

I am a fan of the decor and the music (as otherwise, it could get noisy due to that its always busy)

The food:
We ordered the buffalo mozzarella salad: I didnt like that one - boring and tasteless.
We ordered grilled calamari and octopus: those were Amazing!!! No comments!

Black ink risotto: Taste is ok - but after couple of bites gets really boring -- as it basically one ingredient--- Rice!!! It should have a little of seafood pieces (it has very little, but non visible- almost blended into the sauce) and some veggies!!!

But I would go again for the sake of the grilled seafood..."}
{"text":"Just want to start off by saying that I've eaten at Michelin star restaurants, and there's never an excuse for poor service, no matter how good the food is. The food here is really good! We loved the octopus and cuttlefish spaghetti, But I didn't like the service! When our wine was served one of the servers spilled it on the table and barely apologized and did not offer us another glass. It was clear that other tables were given a lot more care than ours. After we paid our bill the server didn't come back to give us our receipt and we left without anyone wishing us goodbye. Yes it was busy but this lack of service for an upscale restaurant was inexcusable."}
{"text":"This is a spot I always bring out of towners and seafood lovers.

They bring fish out like steakhouses bring cuts of meat to choose. I've enjoyed everything on the menu - the black ink pasta will turn your entire mouth black though.... so maybe not a first date option.

The place has a ton of character and the service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my fave restos in Toronto. 

The art work is spectacular -- all done by the owner himself!
The service is the best, food is always perfect, and even the washrooms are gorgeous and clean. 

You must try the squid ink risotto.

Their website doesn't do the place justice."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place until a friend visiting from Chicago told me about it.  The quality of the food was very impressive but it came with a price to match.  

They start off by bringing you a platter of the seafood of the day for you to pick from or you can pass and just order off their menu. We ended up picking a filet of Alaskan cod (cooked to perfection) and BC oysters (so creamy and milky). 

From their menu ordered their famous squid ink pasta. I had this dish only once before and it was amazing but Josos was 100x better.  I could eat the entire plate myself.  The calamari that everyone raves about was definitely not overrated - my only  complaint is the small portion that came with a $28 price tag.  

We also ordered a seafood risotto - that was done perfectly.  But as the menu and servers indicated, it takes 20 minutes to make so that was the last dish that came and by then we were so full that we had to pack it to go.  

Overall, I had a great meal here that I thoroughly enjoyed to the dismay of my wallet.  Will probably be back for a special occasion - or when I crave the delicious squid ink pasta."}
{"text":"Exquisite food, service and ambience. Their seafood dishes are incredible and the ink pasta is a must!"}
{"text":"\"A midtown restaurant, nestled into a two story house, this place has been here for as long as I can remember. A Mediterranean seafood mecca, replete with erotica that makes you grin every time in spite of yourself, Joso's is not to be missed.\"
Excerpt from http://morevanilla.com/post/34002569719/josos-bares-all"}
{"text":"This place can be quite a visual shock at first. From the tremendous clutter of all the weird decor to some odd items like a statue of a topless women? You won't be forgetting this place any time soon. This place was recommended to me by a good friend who had raved about their seafood. While I do agree that the food does taste good for the most part, I just can't agree to the prices.

I am a big seafood lover. Having sample some of the finest abroad and overseas in Asia and Europe, I find it very difficulty to find anything comparable here well except for lobster, crabs and mussels. Fresh seafood needs no fancy preparation as it already tastes great even with just a bit of butter, salt, pepper and a good squeeze of lemon.

We ordered their specialties of course; risotto from scratch and grilled whole fish. The risotto tasted great and you can tell it's made from scratch. I can't say it's the best I have ever had but it's difficult to criticize risotto from scratch. On the other hand, I can confidently say the grill fish is delicious! The fish was fall off the bone tender, juicy and wasn't too fishy. Only criticism is perhaps that you couldn't really tell it was grilled. We also had a seafood soup but that was a bit underwhelming. It was unseasoned and lacked flavour.

All in all a pretty good meal but with ridiculous prices. And the decor is one of those things where you either hate it or loved it and it this case... I am no fan of it."}
{"text":"Very nice squid ink pasta and seafood. Interesting decor inside. They bring the seafood plate over to ask you which one you'd like to try. Recommend you make a reservations as they were quite packed when we went"}
{"text":"Q. What if you could put a restaurant in time capsule? 
A. You shouldn't but if you did you would have Joso's. 

I remember coming here in my 20's for a \"fancy\" night out and possibly to see a celebrity.  20 years on not much has changed.  

To be fair the food isn't bad it's just overpriced and really not exciting or new. 

The service and questionable Decor (that we all giggled at in our 20's) is really where the issues are.  It's like looking up a old gf/bf from that long ago and getting that though in your head \"what was I thinking?\"."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent. From atmosphere, waitress, food, wine list, food presentation, to desert. The only criticism I could say is that the bread could be a bit better in the antipasto. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Joso's provides a unique experience to fresh seafood and fine dining. The decor is mediterranean eclectic, the service is impeccible and the food is amazingly fresh. Each visit begins with an extensive tour of their fresh seafood options of the day, with the waitress patiently explaining flavor profiles and answering questions.

My first visit was to celebrate an anniversary and it was the perfect choice. The atmosphere is romantic but relaxed, everyone is enjoying their meal and the food was delicious. We had the oysters, bronzini and the octopus. The fish and octopus was simply grilled and sprinkled with lemon juice but each bite was unique and flavorful. They even surprised us with dessert to celebrate with us!

Friendly note that this place is not that child/kid friendly. The space is a little tight and the art in the washrooms may be cause for a lot of explanations."}
{"text":"The food here is spectacular. I had the octopus salad and we shared a dozen oysters. My main course was grilled Sea Bass. So Fresh So good. I felt like I was at a Croatian restaurant off the the Adriatic. As Arnold would say \" I'll be back\""}
{"text":"Oh gosh...this was great.

The atmosphere is intriguing and a great conversation starter! The food is spectacular ( trust me you pay for it!)

Here is what I had:

Appetizer
- Platter: Some grilled octopus and fried calamari with the fresh salsa.  Both of them were excellent. Not greasy and very fresh. Reminded me of when I ate calamari in Santorini. (5/5)

Dinner
- Grilled Italian Sea Bass: the fish was delicious (5/5)
- Rice: Basic (3/5)
- Joso's salad: Basic but compliments the meal wonderfully (3/5)

Dessert
- For dessert Creme Brule: top notch (4/5)

I am coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm about to embark on a familiar trope for yelp reviews but I can't help myself - the food here is very nice but the service does it a savage injustice. like some other yorkville restaurants, joso's suffers from a favouritism for familiar customers that it hardly attempts to conceal. Our table received very spotty service while  other tables had servers basically hovering over them. It became clear quite early on that out server did not deem us worthy of her attention, and wordlessly plunked our plates in front of us without any kind of description of what we were about to eat. In terms of the food we ordered, the cuttlefish pasta was very nicely done, if not a bit too heavy on the olive oil, and the octopus schiavone was very tasty but the presentation was lacking, as it was hacked to bits, tasty bits, but bits."}
{"text":"Went to Joso's for dinner last night. A party of six, all first timers, there to celebrate my birthday. 

Not a good first impression upon arrival at hosting. I arrived with my boyfriend at the same time as another couple. They were acknowledged and promptly seated. We were not acknowledged. When the host returned a couple of \"regulars\" behind us were warmly welcomed and taken to a table, again leaving us standing at the entrance awkwardly.  The host then got us but because he had to rejig tables to seat the regulars we had to stand in the middle of the restaurant while he moved things around with his back turned to us while chatting to his regulars. 
Simply disgraceful.

Once the rest of the party arrived the host was kind enough to offer to store my flowers in the cold room.  

The food was fine. As appetizers we had calamari (nothing to write home about), grilled octopus (absolutely delicious!!!) and a very yummy Adria salad. As mains two of us had the the black squid ink spaghetti, two the 'Leonardo' spaghetti and two grilled octopus dishes. The black squid ink was ok but it was missing something...not flavourful enough. One of the guests who had the Leonardo pasta found it a bit dry and the other had to request parmesan as it was not offered. The grilled octopus was the best dish. In my opinion it should be served on a bed of something as opposed to the guest having to order a side separately. 

Two cocktails (mint and ginger martinis) were very good. Wine was good. 

Waitress was nice and efficient. 

Drake may have immortalized this restaurant through his lyrics but one visit is sufficient. A recent experience at Terroni was much more pleasing overall. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Their special is absolutely delicious.  My favorite was the fish steak.  There are so many different names I can't even remember.  Highly recommended spot to go on a date or if you're a fish foodie.  It's also in York like so there are great spots to check around post dinner.  However the atmosphere is so intimate you'd want to hang around and get closer to your SO.  I would not recommend it for families or those who are religiously conservative as there are pictures of half naked/ topless women everywhere.  This restaurant also comes with a lot of history as you'll find out from all the historical B&W pictures and the walls and has a sense of \"pirate\" culture."}
{"text":"The best italian food I have had. The squid ink risotto was one of a kind. It was my friend's bday and I asked for a pastry. They gave a small surprise by singing a song and making the bday special. Everything we ordered from the fired calamari to grilled octopus was toothsome. However, i gave them four stars as they asked us to pay for the bday pastry which is a shame in regard to such a classic restaurant. No complaints with the service or food though :) would definitely reccomend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Brace yourself for a unique meal with fairly wild art (prudes avoid this one) and possibly the best seafood I've had in Toronto. From apps to mains, service to atmosphere, the meal was simply outstanding."}
{"text":"I would describe this as one of my worst dining experiences in recent memory. The restaurant, at least upstairs is not air-conditioned and was far too warm. The food was mediocre; hit and miss with some decent but not outstanding items and several disappointing ones. The grilled fish was particularly disappointing. The most disappointing part was the service which could charitably be described as inattentive but bordered on rude at points: they forgot the sides and then after being reminded bought them out after the entrees. 

I will not return to this restaurant and will not recommend it to any of my friends - in fact I would actively discourage them from dining there."}
{"text":"IDEAL DATE NIGHT SPOT FOR THE SEAFOOD LOVING COUPLE WILLING TO SPLURGE!!

My boyfriend took me here to celebrate our anniversary together because I'm a huge seafood fan (he's not). It was great!! I'll break everything down: 

Atmosphere: dim, small, not good for big groups or the uptight (don't bring your conservative parents here). It was a great choice for a date, the decor is interesting (lots of breasts and nudity) but overall fun yet still classy?? 

Food: yum !! I HIGHLY recommend the octopus, calamari and the mussels. For dessert, try the chocolate mousse and apricot crepe. The only thing I was not really a fan of was the fish soup.

Service: I was seated right away (with reservation) and the staff were friendly which was great. When seated, the waiter brings you a plate of the produce to display the different options and briefly explain the origin and flavours of the seafood. They take pride in their knowledge about what they source and I appreciate that. 

Price: expensive for my taste. It's an average of $28 per item and for us to be filled, we picked 5 or 6 items from the menu.

TDLR: bring your date here if you like seafood and willing to splurge a little."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple Croatian friends who have been coming here for years (the owner's family is from Zadar). This is one of the best seafood restaurants in the city and it's surprising that it has gone under the radar for a while. I mean, there is a wall of celebrities who have visited the restaurant, but I haven't read a recent review of this place in any website/magazine/newspaper for a long time. So, even though Joso's has been in business for decades and is Zagat-rated, it still felt like a \"discovery\". 

I went for dinner on a Friday and they do 2 seatings, 6:30 and 9:30pm, so plan/reserve accordingly. This is the kind of place to have a long, unhurried dinner with lots of courses! 

The restaurant itself is cozy with 2 floors and the walls are absolutely covered in art. The current owner is Leo, the son of \"the\" Joso behind the name. His father's art work is on display, including paintings and sculpture. I sat in the corner table on the first floor, which has a lovely collection of Picasso sketches to admire while you eat. The whole atmosphere is very European with a laid-back elegance. There is a small, covered patio in front. 

The food is best enjoyed with a group. We ordered the famous risotto nero (black risotto dyed with octopus ink). It's around $45 and only comes in one serving size for 3-4 people. We were just 3 people and definitely had leftovers. Beware, the dish is delicious but it does sort of turn your teeth black for the rest of the meal! So be careful if you're on a date:P Next we shared a seafood platter. At the beginning of your meal, the waitress brings out a display of the seafood available for the day and you can choose whatever looks good. We opted for the red snapper, with some sardines and calamari (a must here!). Everything was very fresh and cooked in a healthy way, without a lot of oil or butter, just grilled with some seasoning. Delicious. It came with some potatoes cooked in the Croatian style (sort of like potato salad but the potatoes are sliced, not mashed). 

Decent wine list with choices in a wide price range. 

Exceptional service. Although it was my first visit, I got kisses on either cheek from the owner. It's the kind of place where it seems that everyone is a regular. 

We unfortunately did not have room for any desserts. Next time. There will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"OMG what can I say ... best seafood and fish in the city. The selection of fish is incredible. The squid ink risotto, was AMAZING! Great d√©cor, very friendly staff.
It is pricey but reasonable for the quality of their food."}

{"text":"Best seafood I have tasted in Toronto!!!
Shellfish, calamari, European seabass and tiramisu were exquisite!!! 
Everything tasted fresh and cooked to perfection!

Great ambiance with paintings and sculptures that gives this place it's uniqueness!!!

Would recommend if you are looking for the best seafood in the city!"}
{"text":"Tried and true, I keep coming back for the seafood here. I literally have never tasted anything bad here. I love the saganaki, though you can't go wrong with that. Nice atmosphere and great service every time. Just nothing to complain about here!"}
{"text":"great quality seafood and amazing mussels. Pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"I don't understand why people like this place. I tried quite a few things on the menu and felt pastas are boring and the seafood is way over priced. The ink squid pasta we didn't enjoy at all and you would think after telling the waitress she would charge us for it especially since we sent it back during our meal."}
{"text":"Four and a half to five.  This is where Spouse and I go for important events in our lives.  It is exquisite.  The food is fresh, carefully prepared and beautifully presented.  It is refined dining at its absolute best.  The rissotto nero for me is one of the highlights.  Rice with squid ink -- deep, rich flavours, melt in your mouth.  The seafood there (all their seafood) is prepared gorgeously (is that a word)?  I have nothing critical to say about this place.  Just wish I could afford it more often."}
{"text":"Not only the foods are super amazing, but the decoration also amazing. The pictures on the wall, the tableware, even he waitresses makeup delicate. You totally can feel the owner put soul and heart in every details in Sojo's."}
{"text":"We were looking for a seafood joint for lent n came across joso on yelp.  Overall everything was pretty tasty.  We ordered the octopus, seafood soup, grilled fish (they have so many types I forgot which one we ordered) n the squid ink pasta.  Everything was light n fresh.  The only downside was the black ink mad my teeth all dirty, but it's worth the experience!"}
{"text":"This place is unique, maybe the most unique restaurant in Toronto. It's small, but really good. I had a pasta dish and my brother had a whole fish. The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.
It was a rainy day and this was perfect place for it."}
{"text":"Cute quaint restaurant with great fresh seafood.
Service was good, not exceptional. For example, your water glass probably won't be refilled but servers are courteous.
Great grilled octopus, you get to choose your fish from a platter of raw samples.
Naked women decor everywhere, was a hit w the guys! ;) would go back, would recommend."}
{"text":"What is there to say about the legendary establishment that has been treating Toronto diners for years on end? Well it turns out a hell of a lot. Leo and Shirley Sparlja have been friends of our entire family for an extremely long time and treat us (as well as every other patron) like royalty as soon as they walk through the door. For the lucky few who have been to Santa Margherita in Italia would know that the d√©cor and quaint feel of the restaurant captures that feeling perfectly (which is not an easy task). Now besides the unbelievable lighting, d√©cor and unmatched hospitality, everyone returns time and time again for the food. Some restaurants like to hide behind an eccentric d√©cor to cover for their lack of experience in the kitchen, but this is not the case at Joso's. Whether it be for lunch or late dinner, Joso's never ceases to impress diners with a wide selection of seafood and fish of the highest quality. One of my favorite aspects of this restaurant is that Leo is not scared to sit down at your table, share a glass of wine (if they are not too busy) and discuss what you like so he can put together a seafood platter that fits your preferences. Now I want to stress to you that your first experience should be with a couple people so that you can taste a bunch of dishes. Try the chopped octopus salad, insalata di mare, grilled fish (whatever is fresh) and please please for the love of god get the Siciliana. This is the glorious unctuous sauce of sepia simmered and stewed in its own ink, it is nothing short of a triumph of culinary tradition. Joso's is considered an establishment for many reasons, however one lies above all. The consistency. Joso's most impressive feature is the fact that they NEVER have an \"off-day\". The front and back of house work so well together it almost seems to be choreographed, which allows them to handle the immense amount of traffic that migrate there every night. Leo and Shirley I would like to tip my hat to you for creating such a mecca of gastronomy. You are greatly appreciated, I will see you again very, very soon."}
{"text":"Excited to be having our company Christmas Party at Josos this year! Best Fish in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place is just average. We ordered two spaghettinis and a calamari to share amongst three. One of the sphaghettinis tasted like straight up dishwater and the other tasted like boxed spaghetti dunked in butter. Only the calamari was good which is why I have it 2 stars instead of 1. Waitresses left my glass of water empty the entire time I was eating. When we finished our meal, we waited a good 20 minutes before someone came by to clear the plates and bring the bill - and we saw all the waitresses hovered in a group talking instead of paying attention to us. Probably wouldn't go back. For the price, I expect better quality food and better service."}
{"text":"Very charming and intimate. It is small so you'll nee a reservation, it was packed on a Wednesday night. There's a lot to look at with art everywhere. Lovely patio but we ate upstairs. Service was first rate very professional, lots to choose from on the menu. Being from the Midwest I consider myself a man of simple tastes so I had a bit a sticker shock when I saw the prices. However, most items are big enough for two. We tried the cuttlefish ink risotto which the waitress warned us was \"massive\". It was, it could have fed 6. It was delicious as were the clams in white wine. I'd love to go back and try some of the fresh catch. It is a place we wanted to try and splurge and had a great time. Emphasis on splurge."}
{"text":"Joso's is the instant embrace of your bust-loving, essentric, gourmand of an uncle. I've been several times as the place has grown to be my marquee spot for birthday celebrations and tasteful nights out. The service is impeccable and a highlight of the evening is always seeing the fresh seafood spread they've got available. When you're here, you CANNOT miss the Grilled Octopus and Seafood Risotto (tomato-based) - no other place in the city can compare. There are the occasional art piece nipslips within the setting, but all in good fun. Despite the price, any Torontoian or tourist, needs to make a trip here to experience the mind & taste of Joso!"}
{"text":"Usually come here once or twice a year with my family. We always order a platter of grilled octopus, grilled shrimp, fried & grilled calamari, oysters and Adria salads as appetizers. I always order a grilled fish (type varies). The waiter/waitress will bring a platter out with different fresh fish that they are serving that day and tell you where that fish came from and what to expect taste wise. I also steal a few bites from the Leonardo pasta that my dad always orders. The bill definitely is expensive for 5 people but the food here is so delicious that it's worth it."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Canada. Period. Fresh fish, shown to you, served in an unpretentious restaurant in a hood renowned for blow hards and overpriced restos. Located in an intimate venue (a converted house on Davenport right at Avenue) the owners brilliant Daliesque art adorns the walls and his statues tower in the corners. The staff and meal consistency are always on point. A meal here is all about the no frills fish & the gang you're with - this place remains a rock steady institution for very good reason."}
{"text":"Make reservations otherwise you may not get a table. The interior was full and fun, a cool and cozy mediterranean vibe in a house. We had:

- The grilled octopus: well cooked with a charred taste.
- The grilled shrimp: perfectly cooked with garlic and herbs, butterfly style.
- Oysters (6 pieces): had two kinds, both great, one more meaty than other. Really fresh but wasn't a fan of the tomato cilantro garnish they had. I felt like it over powered the taste of the oysters.
- Shellfish risotto : The best risotto I've had, some people might not agree but this one was perfectly cooked with big chunks of seafood like shrimp, squid, clams and mussels. Portion was large, enough for up to 4 people.

I feel like this place was great except the only thing is, its a bit pricey. The quality of the food is great but they should be able to do half sizes for dishes to cut costs and large quantities for people that want more variety at the table. Next time must try their flamed grilled fish from their great selection."}
{"text":"\"Eating like I'm seated at Swish, Sotto and Joso's\" - 5am in Toronto

I'm not ashamed to say that this place was a recommendation from a Drake song (the guy has good taste in food). In addition to the name drop, Yelp had great things to say about this place so it seemed like a no brainer. 

One of the most unique restaurants I've been to from a decor standpoint. The walls are lined with artwork displaying naked women and statues. Certainly makes for great conversation amongst the guest.

Food wise, I had an order of the seafood risotto. Truly a delicious dish, but I can honestly say that I've had better. I can't put my finger on exactly could have been better, but it was the difference between perfect and delicious. That being said, this dish was cooked very well and had all the staples of a good seafood risotto dish.

The crowd is trendy and well dressed. Definitely a great place for a date or a group dinner. One of the most fascinated parts of the dining experience is the fish presentation made by the waitress. They bring out all the fish on a platter and explain the taste and texture of each one in great detail. After your mouth is done watering, you'll undoubtedly order one of them. Side Note: Highly recommend dining outside if it's nice out. 

Overall great experience here. Thanks Drake!"}
{"text":"The spaghetti and grilled sea food are tasty, but the most impressive to me is the style of the restaurant. There are so many collections and paintings that you can think it as a museum. Good for dating."}
{"text":"One of the best seafood restaurants in Toronto! It is also considered to be one of the top high end restaurants in the city. The food is absolutely delicious, the squid in pasta is to die for! What is great about this place is that the owner's son greets everyone and knows all his regulars. The restaurant also has a great wine selection, so if you're a wine enthusiast you are in for a treat!"}
{"text":"One word expensive,two words too expensive! 
But it's really really delicious! Especially the BBQ red fish, I recommend. The most fantastic south  Italy food in Toronto. Next time I shall invite  my parents to have a try."}
{"text":"The seafood are fresh and amazing!!! The service is good. I love this place, and I will definitely go to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Ordering an appetizer of shrimp followed by a main course of branzino (which was substituted for a similar fish when they ran out) made for a happy dinner. Everything was done very simply -- not overwhelmed by anything other than the very well prepared nature of the seafood itself.

That, a cold beer, and good conversation (though it was quite LOUD outside on the night we were there) made for an overall great experience."}
{"text":"I was taken here by my boss and had never heard of it and certainly had no idea it was such a movie star hangout when the TIFF is running in September.
All I know is the Fish is some of the best I have ever enjoyed in a restaurant and they have a killer wine list too.
It's not your average night out but if you want to splash the cash with a guaranteed reward make a reservation."}
{"text":"Solid grilled octopus spaghettini (joso's).  Very, very good.  The server showed me a plate of what fresh fish was available for the day, but I was dining alone so I couldn't eat a whole grilled fish.  The oysters were also delicious and different options properly described.  Drinks were mixed very well.  The vodka/ginger drink was excellent and refreshing.  Service was good overall and friendly.  Atmosphere is eclectic as there are a lot going on on the walls.  Clearly this place is pro boobs.  Boobs are all over the art pieces.  The only drawback is the bread options are a bit dry, but the cracker is very good that comes to every table.  Overall, totally lives up to the hype and reviews.  Did I mention the grilled octopus spaghettini was excellent?"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Toronto, I have been going there for a long time.

The food is excellent and the staff go out of their way to make sure that your experience is above average. 

If you have never been to Joso's you must add it to your list, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Magical. Food is excellent. My manhattan was also off the charts... some variation had me thoroughly impressed. Cool crowd and nice waitresses"}
{"text":"Came here for birthday dinner with my special friend. The food was delectable. The seafood out of this world fresh. The atmosphere is a little kitschy to say the least, but somehow it all blended together to create a classy, romantic vibe. Despite it being a busy Friday night, the wait staff were very attentive. 

I've seen some complaints on Yelp about the place being quite pricey, so we went in there with the mindset that we would be dropping quite a bit of dough. But we actually found the food to be quite reasonably pricey. Wine was abut $50-60 per bottle on average. The fish that was recommended was $40. All in all, with appetizers, mains, a bottle of wine, post-dinner drinks, and dessert, our bill came to about $250, which included tax and 18% tip. 

Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Truly the best Fish Restaurant in Toronto! The Risotto is amazing and the Fish is Fabulous! The atmosphere is cozy and warm. Just an amazing place to eat!"}
{"text":"Unique, sexed-up decor, great service, amazingly fresh seafood including the  oysters, shrimp, and scorpion fish which came whole-on the bone & some very refreshing cucumber gin martinis to wash everything down!"}
{"text":"This place is oozes Sexy!

If you are lucky enough to squeeze into this small and intimate place, you will enjoy it immensely!  Ordained with nude original art & sculptures, the whole experience is just so sexy -- so delicious -- and if you weren't in public,  you may just want to be naughty!

Super lovely and professional staff, an amazing experience into seafood.  Makes a wonderful romantic evening for two, or a fun experience for a small group.

Their website features photos of celebrities who've dined here, literally a whos-who.  I HIGHLY recommend this place for a great evening!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I also love boobies. I booked in advance so we got a table immediately. Firstly, I must say... I absolutely adore our little table. When I sat next to my boyfriend on the sofa seat (I was really suppose to sit across), I was squished and attached to him because tables were placed SO close together. Big plus for me hahaha!

I had the Spaghettini Alla Leonardo, which was diced octopus and shrimp in angel hair spaghetti (spaghettini). Generous amount of octopus pieces :) considering this is in Toronto. And it was delicious!

The highlight, really, was my boyfriend's dish, Spaghettini Alla Siciliana, the black ink spaghettini. Surprisingly AMAZING!!! I thought it'd be icky squid ink, but I knew other reviewers were saying good things about it... SO YES! IT IS TRUE, it tastes awesome, and it's much messier than spaghetti with heavy tomato-sauce. The ink was splashing everywhere.

I didn't like our waitress though :( she was kinda snobby (hence the 4 stars).. but wasn't TOO bitchy, and I tipped her $30 (she was so nice to me as I walked out the restaurant). So in total, that was $80. 

So really... $50 without tip, the bill wasn't expensive :D! Would LOVE to come back and try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this restaurant being a \"must go\" experience when in Toronto.  You will not be disappointed- the eclectic decor, the service, and especially the food - is what any special dinner should be - memorable.  The appetizers were fun - the wine selection was plentiful, and the fresh fish - presented whole and on a platter to the table for one to make their selection - was an enjoyable and educational experience.  My freshly grilled whole fish was simply delicious.  When in Toronto, Joso's will be at the top of my list for an excellent evening."}
