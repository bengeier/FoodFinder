{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food ever! Their food is awesome, healthy, and very fresh. If you haven't tried it you are missing out."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to leave a review cause the place is already busy and it doesn't need carloads of Yelpsters from Summerlin but I think it deserves the praise!   Best Mexican beef soup in town....$5.99  Best Agua Frescas (especially the Cantelope) $1.50  The service is always fast and efficient...especially if Jasmin is working the counter!   And I can grab some groceries on my way out.....highly recommended"}
{"text":"I don't recommend. I like the store but the food part \"taqueria\" is always dirty. The meat has a taste like it's been sitting out for a while. I won't try this place again."}
{"text":"Tacos are pretty good for the price.  $1.50 vs $2 at cilantros or el Gordo Asada is good and the pastor is good but may be a little too salty for some.  Chips and beans are included.  Salsa bar okay.  I went back to try the gorditas. The cashier asked the cook if she had any and she did.  They deep fried some corn meal. The sandwich had meat (asada) lettuce, mayo, mexican cheese. The sandwich fell apart at first bite. No chips and beans even though it was most $5 after tax. Would i recommend?  Tacos yes  Gordita no"}
{"text":"Carne Asada Tacos (no gristle) for $1.25. They even throw some chips and beans on your plate for free.  The BEST, FREE Salsa bar in this neighborhood (check Sonny's pic if you don't trust me).   Jump my gringo ass into this gang, esse. This place is da bomb!!!"}
