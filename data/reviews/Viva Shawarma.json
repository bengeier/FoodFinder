{"text":"This place does NOT disappoint!   This is a small mainly takeout place corner of St Claire & Victoria Park ..  I love my food tasty and full of everything and the mixed shawarma plate I had was just that!  Fresh, Full of flavour and just amazing.  The prices are very low compared to other shawarma places , and big portions just how I like it. Its an all around win! Lol  Ive attached a picture of my beautiful food,  Which mind you was under $10 each lol.   Owner is very friendly and welcoming , a joy to talk to. I told him im not big on falafels so he gives us some falafels on the house to see if Id change my mind, & honestly I did love them.     My go-to shawarma place !"}
{"text":"Tonight was gonna go down two ways: go to a regular place you've grown tired of, or take a chance and try out a new joint! Take a chance, time for a new experience. Google reviews have been solid, so have the fellow Yelpers. It's only 2.5km from my place, checks all the boxes, in my car I go for the short drive!  The place is small I'll give you that, but that's what hidden gems are! Small eateries and ones that really amaze you. Best to take away and enjoy at home. There isn't much parking at all, aside from local street parking on the main road, which depending on the time you visit, may be impossible to find. Best to park at the McDonald's across the street and walk on over. Drive thru was full when I parked... okay people I got to say this to you, do you realize their hamburgers look the same if you left them out for 4 days?  Server at Viva Shawarma was extremely polite, very chill. I honestly couldn't decide if I wanted rice in my plate or fries, he honoured my choice for a half chicken-half fries option. Got all the toppings and he does have a lot! Lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, jalapenos, pickled turnips, hot peppers, chick peas, etc. Everything is fresh and assembled in front of you, and the sauces are bomb!   Viva Shawarma!!"}
{"text":"Found a really good Shawarma place in the area (where there are none) and the service is great! The young man who owns and runs the restaurant is very passionate about his business and it definitely reflects in the customer service. The food itself is very flavourful with the veggies being fresh (I once went in near closing time and it was just as good!) and the meat is tender and juicy. Highly recommend it for those in the area looking for a quick bite, but don't want to sacrifice taste for the price (this place is EXTREMELY reasonable)."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of shawarma.  I mean a lot.    I don't think I can pick one that's the best, but I can pick one for each part of the city.  If you are anywhere close by, give this place a shot, you will be pleasantly surprised.    There is a lot to be said for no frills, do one thing and do it well. That's how you get great consistency and a great product.   The young owner shows pride in his product and his work.   Don't blink or you could miss this place. Sandwiches into a small shop in a strip plaza you could easily miss it, so keep your eyes pealed and get ready to enjoy.    Their 2 sandwich special really is a great deal for the price."}
{"text":"Good Shawarma in this area of the town. Friendly owner..   Great food, certainly deserves a revisit"}
{"text":"The Best Value Shawarma in east end. Try the Shawarma breakfast which is unique. Falafel are made fresh in front of you."}
{"text":"Damn good shawarma. For the price the quality and the quantity is very worth. For 6 75 I got a big ass wrap and it was delicious. This spot deserves more recognition. The owner was super nice and friendly. The only problem was the wrap wasn't wrapped that properly but it still worked out. Overall this place is one of my fave shawarma places"}
{"text":"Had Viva Shawarma yesterday for dinner.  I had just got back from a long day of exploring when I crossed paths with this gem right off the bus at St Claire and Victoria Park. I had the chicken shawarma with all the topping and a side of fries. The fries were definitely one of my favorites I've had. The shawarma itself was nice and moist, very flavorful on its own but the addition of all the toppings made it that much better. Definitely need to eat here at least once more before I head back home to the states."}
{"text":"Talk about customer service! This place is the definition of excellent customer service.  I came across this place randomly yesterday while searching for a place to eat for lunch. I checked out the reviews and thought I'd give it a shot.  I was greeted by a very friendly and knowledgeable girl at the front counter and she help me decide what I should be trying. I got the chicken shawarma wrap and a Mixed Plate. Both of them were incredibly delicious with incredibly juicy meat and a healthy topping of vegetables. They are definitely not stingy on either. They have homemade hummus which is fantastic! They had a special for Shawarma poutine which I will definitely be trying the next time I'm there!   Overall if you're in the area I would highly recommend you check this place out!  Delicious and cheap! You can't go wrong with that.! Strong 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome . service  right in my back yard will go back more .have gone back 6 times in two weeks lol"}
{"text":"In the area where I live, by Warden station, there are more than a few shawarma places.  I have a favorite out of all of these, but I went here the other day and it this one about tied with the other.  I've only been there once, but the only thing I would like is a couple more sides.  Everything was fresh and delicious, and a good deal.  The owner is very friendly.  Plan on doing take out, it's small inside.  I'm giving it a 5 because it's a great addition to the neighborhood, as well as being a good deal."}
