{"text":"I've driven by this place quite a lot but it always seemed to be closed. Turns out they are only open for lunch between 11 am to 3 pm so I decided to drop in and check it out today.  Overall good food, portions were great, and the price was good.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Came here because of the great reviews, and it was a massive disappointment. First of all it took half an hour to get our food. We were one of two tables here. While we waited for our food, one of the women working sprayed down a table with some seriously smelly cleaning products (not pleasurable when you're about to eat!). She even coughed from the smell! Biggest let down was that my fianc√©'s food was actually cold when he got it. Not sure that happens after cooking it for half an hour. When he asked if they could heat it up, they were extremely unprofessional. Better off never coming here!"}
{"text":"Hidden quaint little gem, only open mon. thru fri for lunch. Well worth the stop unless your looking for somthing fancy smancy joint. Had a Teriyaki Tofu Bowl over brown rice perfect for me except the size, had take half of it home with me. A real surprise was their Cucumber salad, VERY GENEROUS portion and delicate flavor. I will be back."}
{"text":"I travel a half hour from Grants Pass to Medford on a semi-regular basis - if my trip puts me anywhere near Bento Phoenix between 11 AM & 2:30 PM - I'll plan my other stops around the Chicken, Noodle, Pea Pod & Peanut Salad - my favorite item on the menu.  You can call ahead to have lunch waiting to be served if you're in a rush - which is really great - especially if you're running late and near closing time.  The food is consistently good and the owner works hard to tailor the spice level to each diner's specifications - once she's nailed it - she remembers and you get the same level of spiciness each time.  I bring friends here - I meet friends here - I tell friends I'm not with they have to come here. In addition to my favorite, I've tried the chicken bento, the shrimp & papaya salad and other noodle & rice based dishes - they're all terrific.  One of my top 5 places to eat on a regular basis in the Rogue Valley."}
{"text":"Maria and company are terrific!  I don't know how they do it, but they seem to actually recall the public's meal preferences!  I mean right down to the white or brown rice detail.  WHICH, I may add is a huge plus, as most all restaurants refuse to prepare brown rice.  Prices are very good, 100% consistent, the food is prepared quickly and they retain your \"buy 10 get one free\" card and happily allow you to cash them in for you.  They take great care of the high schoolers, allowing them to text orders to the owners for immediate pick up.  A great service and helping to keep our kids off of junk food for lunch due solely to time constraints.  Thanks, ladies!"}
{"text":"Update:: closed This place is incredible!  I honestly cannot get enough of this place. I've been here 5 times now and have had something different every time. Not your typical Bento offerings but of course they have teriyaki chicken, and it is the best I've ever had."}
