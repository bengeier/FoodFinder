{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch here.  The place has typical BBQ decor and ambiance, but the owners are super-friendly and as other reviewers mentioned, really passionate about what they do.  I had a smoked turkey sandwich with the house sauce and it was tender and yummy.  Loved the sauce.  I didn't try the other sauces because I liked mine so much, but they had a bunch of different kinds that sounded interesting for the more adventurous.  We also really liked the homemade cajun potato chips, and even the pickles were good.  I agree that the beef brisket could have been a little more tender, but the flavor was good.  Overall, we had a great experience here and would go again."}
{"text":"Have only tried the ribs so far but found them to be lean and flavorful. Try the sauces before you order as they may not be exactly what you might expect based on their names or descriptions. Ribs are somewhat tough, not fall-off-the-bone tender, but this is because they are truly cooked on a pit rather than boiled and then finished on pit (if that); if you are used to ribs at Applebees and think those are true and great BBQ ribs, this is not the place for you. Have not tried the sides. The owners really know their barbecue and are happy to discuss/describe their process to you."}
{"text":"who do you have to blow around here to get 5 stars?    based solely on the food, this is a 5 star BBQ joint.  The fit and finish of the place isn't so great, but it is a BBQ joint, not white cloth.  I have had North Carolina, Texas, and Oklahoma BBQ and this place stacks up with most places from those great BBQ states.  If you go in with the expectation of great food, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great find!! From the great service, to the tasty food, to the traditional red and white checkered table cloths, Fat Casual nails it perfect.  I travel weekly for work throughout the US (coast to coast and border to border) and typically dine by myself.  Being my first time at Fat Casual, the service staff took their time to describe their offerings, how it's prepared and really spent some time to make sure I got something that would suite me. Even after I got my food, the server hung out at the table making me feel welcomed and discussing various food experiences since I was dining solo. Good southern feel. Since my first trip, I have returned about a 1/2 dozen times and each experience gets better and better.  I have ordered the Dinner Platter which came with a 1/4lb of each of the following: Turkey, Pork, Beef, and Sausage. I got the homemade chili and the home mac n cheese for my sides (Everything there is homemade except the bread). Then there's the sauces...'cause what BBQ without sauce! I did the Texas and the Bayou sauces as I'm a fan of the spicy stuff, very flavorful. The Spicey Mustard BBQ sauce is my favorite...starts off sweet, then blasts you with the heat!  All their sauces are homemade and represent different regions of BBQ. The beef sausage was amazing...my favorite thing of all the items. It was juicy, tender, and exploding with flavor!! The homemade sides were great as well. On separate trips, I have ordered the homemade baked beans which are excellent.  The Piggy Pudding is a great cap to a wonderful meal...a good sweet whipped dessert with caramel and chocolate chip toppings. I didn't have a single item that was shy of amazing.  Don't let the outside of the building fool you, this place is stellar BBQ!!! Only being open a few months, this place will do well!!   I've had Rudy's in Texas, Slows in Detroit, the Salt-Lick in Austin, and Lee's in OKC...Fat Casual has evolved into some great competition for these guys!!! Will be back as often as I can. Keep up the good work FCBBQ."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I haven't actually eaten here.  I was looking for a place to go for dinner last night near Macedonia, and I remembered that I'd been wanting to try this new(ish) barbecue place.  Their website is completely blank and the latest review on Yelp was several months ago, which made me nervous that they had closed down.  Normally if I can't get reliable info online I just write the place off, but I was feeling generous so I called (around 11am).  A guy answered (yay!), and I asked what their hours were.  He said \"Well, I'm open now.\"  \"Until what time?\"  \"Until I run out of food.\"  \"ooook.\"  So not helpful.  At all.  I get that this is the policy at some establishments, but you could elaborate a little bit.  Do you only serve lunch?  Are you usually open for dinner?  What time on average do you close?  If I show up at 7:30pm, will half of the menu items be gone?  I mean, come on man.  You have me on the phone already.  Put a little bit of effort into not driving my business away with your rudeness!"}
{"text":"I really badly want to love this place.  The people are great, but after having Texas BBQ this wasn't even close.  The prices are very reasonable and the chili, chips, baked beans and variety of sauces are good.  The Mac and cheese was decent.  It wasn't particularly creamy or flavorful.  The cornbread is dreadful.  It's light and does not taste good at all.  The meats: sadly the smoke flavor was light.  It was more noticeable on the turkey and a bit in the pork.  The brisket was more of a grey color and very greasy.  Now I assume hey aren't sure f how much to maker keep it going so the brisket probably sits in a pan of its own juices and in a warmer.   The sausage has a very soft texture and the flavor is ok.  It's not the typical kind of sausage you would find at a BBQ joint.  My search for good BBQ in NE Ohio will continue.  I was excited about the variety of meats, but it just wasn't right."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here but they were out of \"everything but ribs\"?! On a Saturday after being in the PD Friday section would hoped they would be better prepared. Don't know that we will make the 40 minute drive again :("}
{"text":"I went with two friends and I got the \"sampler\" with mac and cheese and chili. I only ended up eating the turkey, pork and mac and cheese. The sausage and chili were both very spicy. Even though we ate there, you ate out of your styrofoam box. While the staff was very pleasant and personable, it wasn't a tasty dining experience."}
{"text":"Awesome smoker ... Great meats and sauce ... Love the chips and the owners are great guys ... Not fancy .. Just tasty"}
{"text":"Great food and even better owners, who took the time to discuss different sauces with our daughters and food recommendations. Pulled pork had a nice sauce as well as the ribs. Definitely will be back....and OH YES...for all of you Arnold Palmer fans (half lemonade/iced tea) they actually have it in the pop dispenser!!!"}
{"text":"Had heard about this place for over a year now. Wanted to try it and I'm glad I did. I consider myself very knowledgable when it comes to smoked meats. I ordered a slab of the ribs, smoked turkey and the sausage. The ribs were very good and needed no sauce at all. I did dip a little in some of the many varieties of home made barbecue sauces. All the sauces were very good. The turkey was also very good. Very moist and flavorful. The best thing I ordered and was blown away by were the smoked sausages. Unbelievable taste with just the right amount of smoked flavor. Some of the best I've ever had. I would definitely recommend anybody to try Fat Casual. I will be back very soon !"}
{"text":"Fat Casual is Ohio style BBQ  what every that means. I guess it's a style all their own borrowing a little bit from all styles. When you enter, you place your order at the counter and then help yourself to a table in the very casual dining room with plastic red and white checkered table cloths topped with  a roll of paper towels and at least a half dozen hot sauces. The owners are very helpful and friendly taking your order and bringing it to you. The ribs where seasoned and cooked perfectly. They where tender with just a bit of pull to it. $8 for half a slab  and $14 for a full slab. The other meats are priced by the 1/2 lb and full lb. I tried the turkey, moist and good but lacked any kind of smokiness to it. The House made Beef Sausage was cooked nicely with a good amount of hickory smoke to it. Sauce was drizzled over all the meats and was a very good balanced sauce, not being too sweet or vinegary,  but just right. I also tried sides of Mac & Cheese and Baked Beans  both $4 for a nice portion. Both where good but not great. other sides offered  where Cole slaw , chili, and homemade chips,,that all looked good. All in all a good find in the Cleveland area, which lacks good BBQ,  It is a little off the beaten path, but worth a visit if in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a 4.5, and I am real hard on BBQ places.  The smoke gives you a small advanced notice to the goodness inside.  All of their meat are above average.  The sausage, pork loin, and brisket are really smoky.  They also have a great pretzel bun.    One fun part about Fat Casual is the BBQ station.  They boast several different BBQ sauces, and many name brand hot sauces.  So you can adjust to your taste.    Quick and easy if you are on the run to.  The main business for now is take out, but feel free to step in and sit down.  I recommend the brisket pretzel bun sandwich with their homemade Cajun chips.  And a Coke and a smile!  This is the top BBQ I have had in Cleveland.  It is a BBQ place, not a restaurant that serves ribs and calls itself a BBQ joint.  Cornbread, Homemade Baked Beans, blue cheese coleslaw, Mac and Cheese.... Did I mention cornbread?"}
{"text":"Man - I was really pulling for this place. Unfortunately, while parts of the experience were great, the overall feeling was exactly meh. We heard about Fat Casual through various internet outlets and decided to give it a shot. There really is a lack of solid eat-until-you get meat poisoning BBQ joints in the CLE area so we like to try any new ones we hear about.  Sean got the brisket dinner with the yam salad and cole slaw. I got the 'BBQ pork dinner' with fried potato salad (sounded super interesting), and baked beans. I will address each in turn.  Brisket: Fatty and greasy, not enough of that yummy brisket smokiness.  Yam salad - interesting and not too bad. Has a vinegary flavor to it.  Cole slaw - just ok - kind of soupy which I hate in a cole slaw.  BBQ pork:  Not so much. First of all,  I was expecting pulled pork (I admit, the menu does not say this, but I've never been to a BBQ place that didn't have pulled pork. Basically, it was small chunks of pork, many, many of which were quite fatty and chewier than they needed to be.   Fried potato salad. WEIRD. Just weird. I can't really describe it. You could tell it was fried something. Had a strange I've-been-sitting-in-the-fridge-too-long stale flavor. Not so much.  Baked beans - of the food we tried, I'd say this was the best thing. Clearly home-made and very tasty.  Also they have a large selection of sauces - some of which are house-made. Pretty tasty.  I was so sad about this place. I wanted so badly to get meat poisoning here on a regular basis. And the owner is such a nice guy - he spent a bunch of time chatting us up. Unfortunately, we probably won't be back. :("}
{"text":"First off - I love the owner/chefs!  They are so personal and most importantly, so passionate abour their food.  They took some time to explain how they've extensively researched different types of BBQ and how they loved it.  The BBQ was very good, but the most awesome part of my meal was the sausage.  Wow, the sausage smoked and in the bayou (cajun) BBQ sauce is excellent.  I liked the sweet potato salad, but I would pass on the fried potato salad (think about cold french fries).  Prices were reasonable for BBQ.  BYOB (they have do not sell beer/wine) and no wait staff.  If you are looking for casual and BBQ, this is it!"}
{"text":"As one user said already, I really truly wanted to love this place.  Northeast Ohio is desperate for a real BBQ Restaurant. Sadly this place is not going to fill that void.  The prices are on the low side for a BBQ restaurant, however after finishing my meal I am glad that I did not pay more for the food.  They did not have a soda fountain, so all drinks come in a can or bottle, which means no free refills.  For my meal I ordered the \"Pitboss Plater\" so I could try a little of everything that Fat Casual had to offer.  The menu said the platter came with 1/2 pound of pork, brisket, turkey, sausage, a full slab of ribs and 4 sides.   Let me start by saying that not one of the items I received had been cooked fresh.  All of the food I received was pre-made and served cold or reheated, but not reheated enough so that it was fully warm.  The pulled pork was oven roasted, not smoked, as one would expect from a restaurant calling itself BBQ. The so called \"brisket\" was not even brisket, It was deli roast beef covered with BBQ sauce!  The same goes for the Turkey and neither was smoked. The sausage was true to its name and was actually smoked. It tasted ok, but it seemed a little under cooked.  One highlight of my meal was the ribs.  They had a great hickory smoked taste and were the only item I received where I felt like real time and effort had gone into their creation even though they too were slightly undercooked. For sides I ordered mac & cheese, fried potato salad and sweet potato salad. All were all simple and tasteless with no thought put into there creation at all. Another highlight of Fat Casual was the BBQ sauce which came in several creative varieties.  However even the delicious sauces were not enough to cover the poor taste of the food I had received.  The dinning room was casual and quaint and the person working there was very nice and attended to our needs. However Fat Casual feels more like a take-out /catering service, not a restaurant. The ribs were good and would be fine for take out, but sadly I cannot recommend dining at Fat Casuals as most of their food was pre-made and tasteless.  I mean really, who wants to pay for reheated lunch meat covered in BBQ sauce?"}
