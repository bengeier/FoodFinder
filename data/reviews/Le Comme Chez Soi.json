{"text":"The mile end has some pretty good burgers but this place is the best. Their combination of bison patties and various accompaniment they serve it with is both unique and delicious.     If you're serious about burgers and live in Montreal you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"My friends and I regularly get together at Le Comme Chez Soi in the evenings and for brunch. There is a full liquor license and it's quiet enough to hear each other speak. The best of both worlds. I cannot say the same for other bars in and around Saint-Laurent.  Recently, I celebrated my birthday there with 30 of my friends. There was enough seating for everyone with room to spare!  The chef, Stefane, is very sweet and accommodating. He made us feel like we were right at home. Speaking with him, it was clear that he loves to make other's feel at home, comfortable and well fed.  What you don't get at Le Comme Chez Soi is your typical bar crowd. Nor will have an upscale crowd of overdressed men and women. This is not a pick up joint, or an upscale restaurant. It's a place you can go to celebrate with your close friends life's little achievements."}
{"text":"like home, but definitely not mine  I didn't care for the ambience.  It reminded me of that friend.  Remember that one friend from high school whose home looked the same when you graduated, as it did when you guys were just 5?  Outdated, stale, and musty?  That's what Le Comme Chez Soi feels like - someone's living room or a lumberjack's mancave.  It's adorned with old lamps and home-y furniture.  Kudos for their vision, but I am obviously not their target demographic.    I loved their open kitchen though.  It's a bright light at the end of a dark tunnel.  In the interest of full disclosure, you should know this was not my first choice.  My sister and I went to Sparrow, but they only have a set menu.  It looked innovative and interesting but I wasn't feeling it, so we left.  My stomach simply had no room for creativity or courses.  It just wanted some eggs and protein.  So we walked a block-and-a-half to Le Comme Chez Soi.  Their menu was simple and predictable.  That was EXACTLY what we were craving.  We shared the benedict and the Bison burger with roquefort and bacon.  I wouldn't have thought to get a burger - except I remember reading about it on Mr. Lew's blog.  It stood out because it`s made with bison.  I like bison - like beef but leaner.  My only complaint is that they treat ketchup like it's a rare commodity.  Our dishes came out with the silver tin only half-full.  Obviously we had to ask for more.  When they brought another tin over, it was even less full.  Now if there's one thing our family could bet our house on, it's the fact that my sister loves ketchup.  So I can only imagine what her inner angry little girl was saying.  She can fool the server, but the smile on her outer peaceful adult woman didn't fool me.    Even with the lack of ketchup, our brunch was yummy.  A special thumbs up for the homefries - crispy and not greasy.  Everything tasted just as it looked.  And sometimes that's all you can handle on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Le service n'est pas bon du tout, les serveurs ont l'air d'être en deuil.  La nourriture est correcte pour le prix (brunch).  Peut-être une mauvaise expérience, mais ça ne m'a pas donné l'envie de ré-essayer."}
{"text":"Ive been here on a few occassions because friends were there or i had a gift certificate. sadly enough it didnt live up to the hype. my first visit the male waitor in an empty restaraunt was down right rude! He made me feel uncomfortable for not ordering n entree when there were lunch specials. he critisized me for the beer i ordered. and was rude when i asked for ketchup. my second trip there was much better nice waitress.. good lunch. my last trip was horrible.again the only patron.. the waitress was new and had no clue to wines they carried by the glass.. never a refill of water... soup was watery with no flavor... and the fish was horrific. it smelled like feces. i felt bad complainin since i was only one there. i paid bill left waitress tip and wrote a letter email suggesting they check the fish something was off with it. and they never even responded. needles to say ill never go back. terribly dissapointed"}
{"text":"It was a clear black night, a clear white moon Pradeep and friend on the streets, trying to consume  We both came across this bar on my FC Barcelona inspired \"Drink and Move\" stratagem.  Allow me to be old timey, methinks back in my day this place used to be \"The Green Room\" (another mile-end gem of a glorious era)  It was a slow evening which meant fast service, drink and move became a hold the fort! Our server was friendly. He came from France, me being a not so great french speaker switched to a language we both spoke, FOOTBALL (Ligue 1, Serie A, La Liga that kind, not your super bowl kind)  They have brunch on weekends which shall be my next adventure. Until then i shall improve my french by speaking more football!"}
{"text":"I loved being in this restaurant. I loved the open air kitchen, the big bustle of movement, 2 men operating the kitchen for about 50 people in the dining room. The decor is top notch, with dark woods and fun volume in everything. I'd come back here in a heartbeat. At the time, there were no labels on the outside dictating it Comme Chez Soi or any other name. Not sure if that's because it was new or slick.   Check the walls for specials. At at least 3 locations in the place, there were specials that were not listed on the menu. There may have been more, but I could not find them.   It's a scene I wish we had more of in New York."}
{"text":"Not a single veggie option. At lunch, we were a group of 5 and 3 ordered the lunch menu and I asked for an omelette as it was the only veggie option. They said my omelette might show up 5-10 minutes after my friends food, really weak. The food seems ok, but the service is average and their lack of a single veggie option leaves a bit to be desired."}
