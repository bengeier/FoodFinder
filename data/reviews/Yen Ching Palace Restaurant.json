{"text":"Ate there last night.  It's in the Bayview Village Shopping Center.  The food was excellent (I must admit I was a bit surprised given the look of the restaurant from the Mall).  Service was friendly and very quick.  We had Tofu with Bean sprouts and a stir fry veggie dish - both fresh and very tasty.  I would certainly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I only partake in the lunch special, which includes (a tiny bowl of) egg drop or hot and sour soup, a veggie egg roll, steamed rice and one of about 8 entrees.  They stopped including the fortune cookie about a year ago.  The special is 8.99-9.99, I believe.

The food is good, but VERY oily.  The entrees just glisten.  The egg roll is also very greasy.  The service is lightening fast.

This place has been renovated since Crandall C.'s review.  It looks pretty nice, now.  It's been in this mall forever, and is very consistent."}
{"text":"Sadly, and exactly one year to the day of my initial Yelp review of Yen Ching Palace, Yen Ching has closed its doors for good. I'm told that a new Asian resto will rise in its place, but as Yen Ching passes, it takes a bit of my five-year-old self with it. Godspeed, Peking Ravioli. Godspeed."}
