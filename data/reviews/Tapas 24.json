{"text":"I'm not sure if the individuals giving negative reviews were there when it first opened four months ago, but my boyfriend and I vehemently disagree with them. We were there tonight, and sat at the bar. Not only was the food amazing, the product knowledge of the staff was incredible, Danny was our bartender, and handled all of our questions easily and with passion. We had the oysters with ponzu and caviar, and the grilled cheese with iberian ham and truffle puree, the grilled cheese was so good that we ordered two more, and they were equally delicious. We highly recommend this excellent restaurant to everyone, and we will revisit it every time that we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"I would give it a 5 star if it wasn't for the loud annoying nightclub music, and the staff that is not attentive at all and couldn't care less about the customers. The manager kept pumping up the music so at one point it was impossible to have a conversation. We had no water and it was really hard to get the girls's attention for service, even though we where sitting right at the counter. We went to have coffee and desert somewhere else... 

Food is great, but I would recommend going to Tapas 24 only if you feel like listening to loud music, and have a lot of money to spend."}
{"text":"Really really enjoyed this restaurant! Walked in- it was packed but not overwhelming and too loud that we couldn't talk amongst each other. The waiter was very patient and kind to us and helped us pick out the best dishes (could have had all of them)
The food was superb minus the potatoes that came with the squid. Otherwise everything (I mean everything) was amazing. They were very conscious of dietary restrictions and had many vegetarian options for my fellow diners too. Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"This place is a good venue if you're celebrating a birthday with friends. Great decor and lively ambiance. While there was potential with the patatas bravas, the foie gras mini burger and the paella rice, the rest of the menu is a pale imitation of any Barcelona tapas bar. All the seafood and ceviche without excpetion were underseasoned. Wine selection was fair."}
{"text":"Friendly service at the bar. When out of town for business eating dinner alone can be a little awkward. Friendly staff, great service, food options and quality are great. Perfect for a drink and a couple of small plates after work."}
{"text":"Overall, a very disappointing and expensive experience.

Being huge fans of Tapas 24 in Barcelona we were very excited to try the Montreal location and see what the regional influence would bring to the plate.

Made a reservation for 5 several months in advance. However, when we showed up it was clear that although we were in the list, they had not decided where to seat our party. They quickly put together two tables for two and added one spot at the end in the most uncomfortable location in the restaurant, jammed in a high-traffic area between the bathrooms, the kitchen, and the bar. We had servers and other customers bumping into us from all sides. I expressed my concern to the server when we arrived before the rest of our party but were quickly dismissed.

Service leaves a lot to be desired. Quick to remove dishes and glasses, slow to attend to concerns or questions, and very very fast to refill glasses to the point you feel you are being rushed out of the place (particularly because you are not asked if you would like something else to drink when you finish a glass).

The menu that tries to be casual but ends up being just plain confusing and disorganized clashes with the atmosphere, decor, and loud environment that feel more like a very pretentious bar.

That being said, the biggest disappointment was with the food, missing all the high notes that we were expecting considering the pedigree of the restaurant. While the restaurant in Barcelona backs up their prices by making sure the ingredients and preparation are top notch, we didn't feel the Montreal location really lived up to the expectations. Hard to pin down exactly how but it was simply \"Meh!\". Additionally, whoever is expediting has very poor sense of timing for a tapas place where it is critical that shared dishes are not sent one at a time with huge waiting times in-between as this makes it really hard to enjoy the food.

My best guess is that whenever they were trying to do a dish from the original restaurant or perhaps something authentic, either the ingredients, the seasoning, or the temperature were off. And when they were trying for something of a fusion nature bringing Spanish flavours to a Canadian dish there was nothing exciting added."}
{"text":"Very poor food. Flavours seemed cheap. Too oily, too sweet, too salty. Far from refined and well thought out. Nice atmosphere, without service to match. The bathrooms also are not very accommodating for both sexes.  Sad to waste an evening in Montreal here. Blah."}
{"text":"Terrible service and value for money. Four of us went for a friend's bday party in late January which we were really looking forward to. The waitress though, was unfriendly, disinterested, borderline rude. Saw her getting into it with a woman at the next table over, so apparently this was just her way. The service also felt rushed, and we left hungry despite having ordered the chef's menu.

The only good part was the drinks (fig margarita was delicious!), but we were never even asked if we'd like another round. This place was a huge disappointment, the low point of our bday celebrations, and we'll never go back."}
{"text":"Server gave the impression that we were imposing by coming.  Facial expressions and body language were obivous that we were not welcome. You cannot sit outside and have a drink because of their licensing which we saw cause one couple to complain then leave.  Understand licence issue however with outside seating on a hot summer day in the middle of the afternoon it should be expected that people want to sit down relax chat have a drink and take in the atomphere.  Not here music is so loud remember it is middle of the afternoon and traffic on the busy road is almost as loud.  Not a pleasant experience from any point."}
{"text":"Food was average but service was HORRIBLE, if that can describe it.

Long story short: arrived and seated promptly.  Then took waitress 15 minutes to come and take drink orders but since we had all that time, we placed our order.  3 of 6 dishes came promptly.  We took our time to enjoy the scenery and beautiful night and before you know it, 45 minutes had elapsed and nothing.  Plates were now empty as well as our water (and no refill insight even though tables next to us where getting refills). Told them to cancel the remaining dishes but they said that it was being made and it took an additional 10 minutes for those dishes to come out.  

All in all, the worse service I have ever experienced and without any sort of explanation or apology - 45 minutes between dishes is inexcusable."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at tapas 24. I would recommend setting at the bar and asking for Sarah. Great service, amazing food, and the cava was very nice. Great start to the weekend."}
{"text":"A fabulous meal tonight. I sat at the bar and was served by Chloe, who was lovely. It wasn't very crowded (on a Wednesday evening in early January) so I was alone at the bar though most of the tables were filled. I ordered a virgin Bloody Caesar that was great, and then proceeded to enjoy three tapas plates. Ceviche, Octopus, and mixed mushrooms. Each was excellent, though the ceviche and the mushrooms were best. I am a huge fan of octopus, and while this was very good, it wasn't as good as the others. 

The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the food delicious. What more does one need? Outstanding."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, but the food is very deceiving. Service and wine expertise very poor. We had canned mussels, french fries dipping in a pool of aioli and unknown sauce, fried calamaries tasting like old oil... Even the dessert was a wierd chocolat quenelle with olive oil and crouton..."}
{"text":"Starting by saying that the food is a bit pricy for the size and quality and for being a Spanish tapas place it lacks on offering the must popular Spanish dishes.
The service was great and my wife enjoyed the cocktails.
I would suggest this place if you are not hungry and just want to have a drink and small appetizers to accompany it."}
{"text":"To be avoided!  The manager is very rude and the way he watches over the staff is extremely uncomfortable for everyone.  Happy hour is only from 5/7 and is only $2 cheaper per drink!  The bread with tomato was way too salty and the portion is just a joke!  The patatas bravas so disappointing, how can you mess up such a simple dish? The portion was a joke, the aoli tasted like warm egg and since when do they use chipotle spice in Spain?  Maybe you should visit Spain before opening a Tapas restaurant.
So many better places to go in old Montreal! Stay away!"}
{"text":"So I'd say 4.5 is more accurate, but overall great food, great atmosphere, and great service

I saw the negative reviews, so was reluctant to try it. Keep in mind I've never been to Barcelona location. After arriving, to my surprise it was packed. Very trendy and hip kind of place. Kind of reminds me of a LA or Manhattan kind of vibe

I came for the MAT special, and crazy amounts of food for the price. It's really more like for 2 than for 1.

Best dish was the cod with the croquettes a close 2nd

If your used to tapas, the size may be bigger than your expecting"}
{"text":"Délicieux en bouche et à la vue!! Service extraordinaire. Je passe un agréable moment  
Nous avons été accueilli chaleureusement malgré l'heure tardive. Merci Dany et Adam!!"}
{"text":"I left the bar feeling disgusted. I am a fan of tapas and am well aware that tapas place usually cost more than any dining experience. Having said that, I went to Pullman on Ave Du Parc a couple of nights before and spent the same amount of money but was left stuffed walking out of the Bar with satisfaction. On another hand, this place didn't show any effort in their dishes. Everything served on the plate makes you think that it wasn't prepared with love or passion. The calamari rings were 14$, for 6 pathetic rings and tasted like some frozen food, certainly looked like something you and I could throw in a deep fryer at home, with the least preparation. They didn't even bother to throw in some greens on the plate to make it look nicer. Croquette with Jamon Iberico.. we could barely taste Jamon in there except for some slimy white stuff, with overly fried crust, double dip with oil. It tasted like fried food being re-fried which was horrible. Bikini sandwich - $12 for half the size of a slice of white bread.. justify that please? I ordered something similar at Pullman and I was actually full from the that dish itself. The lamb brochette one skewer for $12 - tasted nothing but some overly marinated stuff (didn't taste like meat to us at all) with heaps of herbs, any souvlaki or kebab place in the food court on Sainte-Catherine would beat this anytime, except that it was half the price, with rice/salad and pita on the side! Tortilla was crap. We were so disappointed that we couldn't wait to get out of the place. I wouldn't even stay even if I was paid to try their desserts. Buckle up guys if you wish to continue to charge patrons at this price."}
{"text":"Not worth the detour.... You can eat better at home. The best part of the meal was the beer."}
{"text":"The food is good and service is fine but the noise is horrible. Make sure not to sit under the subwoofer!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Friday evening. It was busy but we had a reservation. First thing I noticed was the loud club-like music (the DJ was right at the entrance). I was unsure if this was a fine dining place or some hip restaurant trying to appeal to a young crowd. Anyway, I came because I wanted to try some tapas. We were seated on the second floor so we had a bird's eye view of the DJ. There were three of us so we shared a whole bunch of different tapas. Rather than go through each one (cause frankly I cannot remember exactly which ones we ordered) I will mention the highlights. The octopus was flavourful and cooked to perfection. The shrimp was delicious as well (but a bit spicy). I would pass on the frites cause it was nothing special. The service was prompt and cordial. My only complaint is the loud music. I was shouting the whole evening cause it was hard to hear the conversation. Also, I recommend coming here when you are not too hungry cause the small plates do add up to an expensive meal. I came home and ate an apple and some grapes."}
{"text":"Pass by this one. Worst experience of our trip to beautiful Montreal. Incompetent staff, mediocre food, high prices. It looks very inviting from the street with a lively crowd (not sure why they're there) and lovely decor, but we waited endlessly once seated and ended up getting food before any drinks. We ordered a margarita and were delivered some sort of martini, and the waiter was quite miffed that we were sending it back. We asked for recommendations for wine by the glass and after a long struggle to extract some information, were delivered something quite weak and thin, instead of the bold red we were looking for. The waiter actually started arguing with us. In a city with such amazing restaurant choices, this one should not be on anyone's list."}
{"text":"Nothing like the food at Tapas 24 in Barcelona.

We were at tapas 24 yesterday for Barcelona chef Carles Abellan.

Service: Very poor. No water. The sommelier removed our glass of wine when empty without even offering another glass or bottle...
(We had planned for another bottle but when we were able to talk to someone, we were done eating)
Seems like the staff was inexperienced.
Entire service was rushed as if they wanted us out for a specific time.(2nd service)

Food: ok but expensive for what we had. Nothing fabulous. Paella extremely salty

Atmosphere: good! Nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh boy, where do I even start.

It was obvious from the moment we came in that we were not welcome. There were 5 of us. The hostess showed us to our table and told me she had another reservation at 8 (it was 6) so we only had 2 hours to eat. Except the restaurant was almost empty, as it still was when we left around 7.

Our waiter was really rude. I asked questions about the menu, making it obvious I had no idea how it worked, and he never explained anything (though I saw him explaining another table !) so we ended up ordering everything at once. I asked for a pitcher of sangria and he condescendingly asked ''Do you know how much it costs?'' instead of politely telling us the price or whatever. Anyway, after I had ordered, I wasn't sure if I had been clear so I asked him and he said ''Yeah sure.''

But I guess it wasn't ''sure'', because we ordered 7 tapas, were brought 5 and were charged for 6. When the receipt came, I checked it to make sure (because we were only brought 5 of the 7 things we ordered...) and I saw we were charged for 6 things. So I told our server exactly which dish we hadn't received and he tried describing it to me and asking if we were SURE we hadn't received it... Yes, I know what I put in my mouth, thank you very much... 

He then said he would take it off and went to the back. But my fiancé, who was paying, followed him ! That's when he overheard our server telling another server that we had obviously received the tapas and that we were just lying to get free stuff but that he would take it off anyway ! WTF???? I'm not going to just shut up and pay $12 for something I didn't even eat ! My fiancé left a 15% tip anyway because, unlike our server, we're actually decent people.

Will highly discourage everyone around us to go because we're obviously not ''good enough'' for this place."}
{"text":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. We should have known what we were getting into when we asked the server if they could slightly change one of their items (a grilled cheese with ham and truffles) to only have cheese to accommodate our 2-year old (they have no kids menu). Her answer was \"We don't make anything here, all of our food comes in already prepared (as in frozen).\" Well, lesson learned. The food for horrifically bad. We could have done better buying frozen appetizers at a grocery store and microwaving them. We spent $175.00 on absolute crap. STAY AWAY! STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!"}
{"text":"Je vais tenter d'être la plus exhaustive possible pour vous donner le portrait exact de mes expériences. Après avoir attendu depuis des mois son ouverture, nous étions empressés d'enfin essayé la version montréalaise du fameux Tapas ç24 qui nous avait impressionné à Barcelone. Nous arrivions donc avec beaucoup de hâte. Nous avions réservé assez à l'avance, et ils ont décidé de nous serrer à 3 sur une table de deux, bien que le restaurant ait plusieurs tables de disponible, dont des banquettes de 4 occupées par des groupes de 2. BON. Nous avons ensuite attendu plus de 20 minutes sans que personne ne nous donne aucune attention, ni verres d'eau ni menu. OK. Nous avons donc arrêté un serveur après avoir compris que la serveuse qui s'occupait de notre section ne voulait nous accorder aucune attention. Heureusement, celui-ci s'est empressé de corriger la situation pour nous offrir de commander les breuvages et nous expliquer les différences entre le menu de Barcelone et celui de Montréal. Après nous avoir apporté le vin, il nous a finalement annoncé qu'il serait notre serveur puisque l'autre était trop occupée pour nous (!). En passant, la table à côté de nous s'est plainte sur le manque d'attention de cette serveuse au maître d'hôtel qui a lui-même assuré la suite du service pour cette table. Nous étions quand même plus contents ainsi, mais il nous disait qu'il serait souvent au 2e étage pour s'occuper de ses tables. Nous avons rapidement reçu les 2 premiers petits tapas, suite à quoi nous avons attendu environ 35 minutes sans que rien ne se passe. Alors que toutes les tables autour de nous se faisaient servir et que nous attendions nos 4 plus gros plats, nous avons demandé ce qu'il se passait (il était quand même 22h). Il est allé en cuisine et est repassé sans nous donner d'update. 10 minutes plus tard, il est redescendu et nous avons demandé de comprendre ce qui se passait. Nous avions fini notre alcool, les tables arrivées après nous avaient fini leur repas et nous attendions toujours. Le maître d'hôtel est finalement venu nous voir (comme la table voisine qui s'était aussi plainte, mais avant nous) et a rapidement fait corriger la situation. 5 minutes plus tard tous nos plats étaient servis. Pour s'excuser, il nous a offert un verre de vin et un dessert à partager. Nous avons trouvé bien dommage qu'il faille s'adresser au maître d'hôtel pour avoir l'attention nécessaire. Nous avons été exposé à 3 situations similaires pendant notre repas à d'autres tables. Les gens se plaignaient, puis recevaient ensuite l'attention nécessaire du maître d'hôtel. J'y suis aussi retournée lors d'un souper d'affaires, sur la terrasse, et bien qu'il était déjà 22h et le resto était à moitié vide et que nous avions un autre serveur, le service était exceptionnellement LENT. Nous avons dû changer de serveur et rentrer pour le dessert et il a fallu demander après 15-20 minutes qui s'occupaient de nous car personne venait nous voir. Visiblement, il y a un problème avec le service dans ce restaurant qui ne semble toujours pas être réglé à ce que j'entends des gens qui l'ont récemment essayé dans mon entourage. Prévoyez environ 3h si vous y allez.
Sinon, au niveau de la bouffe, c'était délicieux. C'est d'ailleurs ce qui m'a poussé à y donner une deuxième chance. C'est définitivement ma carte espagnole préférée en ville. Le ragoût de queue de boeuf, le sandwich bikini, le ceviche, sont des plats savoureux. Les boules de chocolat avec fleur de sel et huile sont la raison pour laquelle nous avions si hâte à l'ouverture. Fou! C'est clair qu'on souhaiterait avoir des portions plus généreuses, mais je ne pense pas que cela change. J'espère que les propriétaires prendront action pour corriger le service, car pour le moment, je ne le recommande plus. Dommage"}
{"text":"El Velodromo is my favorite in Barcelona and many things here taste exactly like they should.  My favorite dish there is huevos estrallados which they have and prepare really well!!!   The wine list is great and cheap for mtl.  But there are some problems.  There were at least 30 minutes before our first and second round of tapas and we were trying to make a show.  We had to RUN to our show.  The menu is not nearly as extensive as Barcelona - but if you want good Catalan tapas in North America this is a good option.  I imagine the kitchen will solve its timing kinks."}
{"text":"Came in for tapas and a bottle of wine on a snowy Saturday night.  Place was not busy which usually send up red flags for me - especially on a Saturday.  

Food was spotty - meaning some dishes were pretty decent, some were mediocre.  The ham croquettes and scallops with garlic and squid ink were the highlights.

Maybe it's just me but when I order tapas, I expect one or two dishes at a time to come out of the kitchen.  This sets the stage for a nice, leisurely meal.  Tapas 24 lost points with me when all the dishes we had ordered arrived at the same time.  Ok, maybe I should have communicated my request to the waitress but I've never had to make this request at any other tapas restaurant before.

Their wine list is pricey the selection is good.  Overall, I would classify this as an expensive place to eat compare to other Spanish restaurants.

Lastly, the music SUCKS!  I get it - this wants to be a hip, fun place.  But when you can't have a conversation, it is too loud!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Spanish food coming from PR. The cod croquettes and tomato bread with Manchego cheese were on point!!!!! The charcuterie platter was absolutely delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently came here for the first time and left extremely impressed. Tapas 24 is located in the Old Port of Montreal. There is a valet service or street parking. The decor of Tapas 24 is very beautiful and contemporary.  A friend and I ordered 3 staters, 3 mains and 3 desserts. All of the tapas arrived very quickly and on a consistent basis, one after another. Although the plates are small, that is normally what a \"tapas\" or \"sharing plate\" is. The food is top quality by using the highest and freshest ingredients and cooked by some very elite chefs. The service was fantastic. Both the waiter and the hostess were extremely polite and knowledgeable. They mistakenly forgot one of our dishes but accidents happen! After realizing they apologized and quickly brought it out. Great service. 

On the dinner menu I would recommend: 
ALITAS de POLLO con SALSA \"ALEGRE\" 
Mc FOIE - BURGUER
LA BOMBA de BARCELONETA 
.... however I am sure anything you order here will be a 10/10."}
{"text":"Not knowing where to eat when you are in a new city is sometimes a daunting task to conquer. We walked past this place and figured we would try it because we saw it the previous day and it was packed. We were a little early and there were a few open tables. They said we could be seated right away, but that there was a reservation for our table in an hour. We assured them we could be in and out in that time.

I wish we hadn't! The food and drinks and service was impeccable! We ordered a variety of things and not a single one was anything less than amazing. I don't throw roses for no reason, but this place was perfect. Perfect staff, fast, courteous, ambiance, did I mention the food.... All of it was on point. Go here!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!    Each dish was rich in it's own vibrant flavor.   Cozy with dim lighting.   Great for groups or for a date.   Loved the music playing in the background."}
{"text":"From service to selection to taste, five stars across the board.  Took some clients here, and they were not sure of Tapas in general.  The sever and chef provided a custom selection, with regular deliveries but no backing up of dishes.  Food and drink were great, and everyone was thrilled with the whole experience. Thanks!"}
{"text":"My mother, husband and I are huge fans of Toro Toro, but we decided to give Tapas 24 a try... But were met with huge disappointment, although given the so-so reviews, I guess I wasn't that surprised. First off, the atmosphere is complete different and seriously lacks the charm of Toro Toro. It just feels like an urban restaurant, nothing spanish about it. Moreover, it took about 20 mins for a waitress to come greet us, and tell us she would be back soon to take our drink order. So we waited and chatted away. We didn't understand the wine menu so wanted some help picking out a wine. When the waitress finally bothered to come check up on us, first off she spoke to us in english. I know we are franco-ontarian and have an accent, but how rude. Not only did we keep speaking to her in french she kept answering us in english. Although this was nothing special for Montreal. She didn't really know the wine menu, and informed us that the sommelier would come see us. Now we were very hungry and at this point it had already been 40 mins. We were seated next to the kitchen so it was very loud, and distracting to see all the waiters walk in and out in a continuous stream. Moreover the menu was some type of hybrid tapas menu. The classic spanish \"patatas bravas\" were in fact just fries... and I have never heard of foie gras at a tapas bar in Spain. So we were VERY fed up. One hour in, water as drinks, no orders taken, lack-luster looking food, and bad atmosphere. It didn't take much more for us to leave and make our way to Toro Toro, where we were greeted with a smile, and immediately told about the wine list. So all in all... Save your time and money and have a wonderful evening next door at Toro Toro."}
{"text":"NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE 

I had a very bad experience with the Tapas 24 snack bar this morning. I called to make my reservation for brunch yesterday and I informed the individual I spoke to that I am in a wheelchair. She confirmed to me that there was no stairs at the entrance and that I'd be able to get inside. Then I arrived this morning to discover that there is a large step both at the snack bar and the tapas 24 restaurant.

Obviously I was quite upset because I had made arrangements to meet my sister for brunch and I booked and paid for a taxi to take me to and from your restaurant.

It was very insulting to have to sit outside and wait for my sister to arrive and then go find another place to eat brunch. It took us an entire hour to find a new place to eat because there are very few restaurants that are accessible especially in the old port. This is why I called in advance to be sure that I could get into the restaurant. I was cruelly misled by the individual who took my reservation. 

Further, the tables at the snack bar are too high for me to sit at anyways. I was surprised that the individual who took my reservation didn't tell me that I wouldn't even be able to sit at the table."}
{"text":"I think most of the negative reviews come from people who have ate at Tapas24 in BCN. And well, I'm sorry but you can't expect the exactly the same menu or even the ambiance to be the same as the restaurant in Barcelona. 
I went with my sister and we had like 15 different dishes, and all of them were (no exaggeration at all) extremely delicious. La bomba is a MUST. It is a bit pricey but in my opinion, I believe it is worth it."}
{"text":"Was amazing! The bartender Sara was so sweet and nice, she let us know all the great places to try in Old Montreal. Food was delicious! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Where does one begin with this place? It's almost as though they went out of their way to screw up as much as possible. These people are not only incompetent but apathetic too which just adds insult to injury.

The service was a fiasco. The food was an absolute let down compared to any tapas you'd get in Barcelona. The portions tiny and the prices audacious considering the almost comical nature of the lack of service and attention. 

After several mistakes, delayed and haphazard delivery of dishes, wine poured into a glass that was already half full of a different wine etc. management made no effort to offer any kind of concession or even express the slightest concern for our dissatisfaction. We were a very undemanding and reasonable group of people who were just pushed to the brink after a series of disappointments.

This place sells image and pretense- they don't know tapas and they're not particularly concerned with what you think either. They are banking on the herd mentality and hoping you're too distracted with your date to notice the level of indifference and disorganization. 

All that money in decor and location while negating the most crucial aspects of running a successful restaurant won't be enough to salvage Abellan's name. If they stay open be sure it is not a testament to the quality of the restaurant but to the undiscriminating and inexperienced clientele. Shame on management. Get rid of the pretentious children who don't know the first thing about dealing with customers and put some professionals in there."}
{"text":"This place looked really inviting so on our first day in Montreal we decided to enjoy a birthday lunch here with my SO. 

The food came out on time and was delicious.

However, the service was just atrocious. 

Our water was not refilled once. In addition to that, our server had been changed 3 times within about an hour. 

When we told one of the servers that we had not received an item we ordered, it was obvious they wanted to fix it and bring us a FREE dessert which we said yes to as we didn't want this birthday lunch to be affected by someone's mishap. 

In the end, not only we were charged by the item we didn't receive, we were also charged for dessert that was supposed to be 'on the house'. When asked for a refund, the manager stated that they cannot refund a free dessert. This business is not able to refund customer's money according to them. 

On our way our, one of the employees caught up with us and gave us additional dessert which was quite a nice gesture. 

The moral of the story be aware of these things and double check your bill if you are going to dine here."}
{"text":"Food sucked.  Service was brutal. Two stars for location.  Ceviche was the worst I ever had.  Old Fashioned was good, dessert sucked. Not much good to say here."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon expérience chez Tapaz 24 dans le cadre de Montréal à table. Nous avons mangé au bar, mais la serveuse a su rendre notre expérience très agréable, du moins jusqu'à la fin du repas ou nous avons dû nous serrer un peu pour accommoder d'autres clients.
Le menu était délicieux, pour 41$, nous en avons eu pour notre argent. Nous roulions à la sortie du resto.

Seul bémol, nous aurions aimé être avisées que les bouteilles d'eau étaient 6$ chacune."}
{"text":"It must say something that I'm eating and reviewing at the same time. The menu, while in French is interesting and traditional to the tapas style, and the staff have no problem explaining and recommending items. Sitting at the bar the vibe of the place is fun and full of happy chatter, looking into the kitchen watch prep work cleanly being done. Everything I ordered was delicious!! It came to me quick and hot when needed nicely chilled when called for !
Friendly staff, nice relaxing vibe, I'd almost drive from Albany to eat here on the fly !!"}
{"text":"Great service! Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu items and suggested great dishes and a great wine for us to try! If you're looking for a quite place to have a convo go to a starbucks!"}
{"text":"Get the lunch tasting menu.  Great deal, wide range of items and surprisingly a lot of food.  COD was excellent."}
{"text":"Good tapas menu, cocktails, beer list. Have had better patatas bravas before but overall a great tapas spot in a good location with outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Literally 24 hrs back from Barcelona and weirdly craving tapas after becoming sick of them at one point lol. Decided to try Tapas24 which is also located in Barcelona. I must say we weren't too impressed. Items are overpriced and the presentation weirdly done. I give 3-stars for the service."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome! No idea what her name was but she had long hair and a lot of colorful tattoos. We had the happy hour special with their house red wine which was surprisingly really tasty. We snacked on a few things and all was good, it was the perfect pick me up before a late dinner."}
{"text":"Its in the Old Port and its expensive but the interior is done right and the food quality is excellent

They only have a few beers available but an extensive wine menu and its an expensive one

Ask before you accept the servers suggestions i.e. $20 a glass is her favorite red

Portions are what are called small plates or tapas but the sizes are actually kind of ridiculous

The cod fritter is the size of a thumb and the same for the chicken version

The charcuterie sampler has chunky cut prosciutto not thinly sliced and the the $40 plate is what i would put on a sandwich

The olives did not have the included anchovy stuffing so you may expect erratic portions

I feel that I may have been found to not be a local so maybe there was no reason to ensure happiness and a repeat trip as it seemed many were regulars popping in for a vino and a small plate before shuffling homeward.

Service was very crisp and polished and I would expect that in what was deemed to be a high end spanish tapas wine bar in Old Montreal. 

Knowing that, please leave the kids at home, the teenagers as well and bring the Amex for a trip to spain for an hour or so of vino and delicious small tapas plates. 

One of the guys in our dinner party said that there is a \"5 guys\" down the street as he was still hungry after his $80 spend....its the constant dilemma about style vs function or quality over quantity

in the world of the foodie experience we have many choices in how we wish to enjoy ourselves

I would highly recommend a spot at the bar if you are planning to stay for a few glasses and small plates as service will be faster and easier for everyone"}
{"text":"Bonne expérience chez tapas 24, bon, décor du restaurant très beau. Restaurant qui sort de l'ordinaire des Resto de montreal. Il manque juste peu être un petit plus niveau nourriture qui me fera dire \"wouhaou c'était super!\""}
{"text":"Decor is very nice. We came between lunch and dinner on a Monday and everything was on point. The place is spacious and well appointed. Our waiter was also the bartender and mixed up some awesome drinks including an amazing and proper sangria and a phenomenal fig Margarita mind you I don't do tequila and it was still great. 

For food we had :

The calamares en tempura - very unique with interesting type sauce. I wasn't crazy about it. 

The mixed seafood ceviche - yum

The eggplant - tasty with honey

The Quebec lamb brochette - not crazy about it 

And the oxtail stew which was delicious. 

Also the bread and olive oil - ask for it."}
{"text":"This place is pure gold. Amazing drinks, food is amazing and the people who own it are absolutely amazing. Would recommend to anyone and everyone.

Sometimes the drinks take a while but they're well worth it! 

Get the bikinis! Get the spicy gin and tonic!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday at 6:30 with 10 ladies celebrating a bachelorette weekend. We were able to secure the reservation last minute, which was awesome. The food was good, drinks were strong, and service was excellent. My favorite dish the potatoes with aioli (LAS BRAVAS) and the mini grilled cheese (BIKINI de \"CARLES ABELLAN\"). I also had the ham croquette and chicken croquette. 

They had no problem not only splitting the bill, but splitting the dishes that some of us shared with one another. Our waiter was so patient and friendly and also brought out a round of shots on the house to celebrate the bachelorette's last fling. I love tapas and it was a great experience!  Great ambiance, would recommend for large groups."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but the service, ambiance, and wine experience were not. I would be giving only 1 star if the food wasn't so good!

This place is incredibly loud, which made conversation difficult. Our server repeatedly forgot or didn't hear what we had ordered, so it took forever to finish the meal and we had empty water glasses for a lot of that time. But the worst part by far was the wine. The markups on wine were the highest I've ever seen for a restaurant. I ordered a bottle of Alto Moncayo, a wine that typically retails for $40 U.S. and which was already expensive at $120 CDN on the wine list. However, we were brought a bottle of Legado del Moncayo, a wine that retails for $10 U.S.! I saw the Moncayo, and assumed it was the bottle I'd ordered only to discover after dinner that we'd been charged $120 for a $10 wine! I hope that was just a mistake, and not a deliberate attempt to fleece a customer, but regardless it left me feeling humiliated and cheated. I won't be coming back. Think twice before ordering wine from this place, and pay close attention to what they bring you if you do! And bring earplugs."}
{"text":"\"Tapas Tasty but an expensive Option.\"

We had 9 dinners on our Quebec vacation and Tapas 24 ranked 5 of 9 for the meal itself.

The downside is that it was the most expensive meal on our trip.

The tapas were unique and quite tasty however they are for 1. Not the place to visit if you are famished.

The restaurant itself is upbeat and the service attentive ( especially as we ordered a few times). I'd check to see if there are happy hour food specials as our issue he was not quality but value.

{"text":"Ambiance, Ambiance, Ambiance! 

I stumbled upon Tapas 24 while strolling through Old Port and the interior blew me away. It is a very chic, large area, classy, elegant and modern. The music was great and the waitresses were also in matching Lacrosse outfits. The service was great and the place is very sophisticated.

I recommend going with several people so that you can order many dishes and share. The portions were very small, even though it is tapas. It was expensive and the bill came out to be around $40 per person. The sangria was delicious and refreshing for a warm afternoon. I recommend the eggplant, the La Bomba (fried ball with warm filling), the octopus, the charcuterie platter and a wine of your choice."}
{"text":"Poor value here. Tapas are tasty but they are terribly small for the price.

Waiter was mice but she kept forgetting our order.

A glass of beer is not a regular glass but a tiny wine glass.

Tapas at the Club Español or Casa Española on St. Laurent are waaaay better."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, there were good options. The potatoes were plentiful, but done differently than any other Spanish restaurant I have eaten at. They were fries rather than cubed. The eggplant with maple syrup was a nice Canadian twist and yummy. The season vegetables were overpriced and I discourage ordering based on price. The toast with tomato was nice and fresh. The sangria was awesome! I would go if you are looking for a more expensive restaurant. I recommend 4-5 tapas for 2 people, not including dessert."}
{"text":"From the moment we turned on the street and approached the building we could hear the music! This place is very trendy and they know what they're doing when it comes to food. We started off with oysters topped with salmon caviar ~YUM. For dinner we had the foie gras burger, ham croquettes and charred octopus. This is one of the two best meals we had in the city. Everything from the drinks, service and atmosphere were executed to perfection! Make sure you make a reservation as they're on everyone's \"Best of\" list! I can not wait to go back and check out the one in Barcelona!"}
{"text":"un peu cher... mais c'est vraiment bon.
mention spéciale pour les pimientos de padron... comme en Espagne."}
{"text":"I'd seen on Yelp that Tapas 24 was highly rated, and paused as I walked past.  What caught my eye though was the \"snack bar\" next door.  That menu looked intriguing... Rabbit, Cuttlefish, Oxtail.  It was lunch, so we walked in and sat at the open kitchen in the back.

Oh my God.

This is the most ridiculously overqualified crew to ever run a snack bar.   Manager ex Fat Duck, Executive chef ex El Bulli.  They do the restaurant nirvana- long careful prep beforehand, and quick finish to serve.  Like the 32 hour sous vide beef that you can cut with a spoon, or the oxtail croquettes.

We hunkered down with a jug of perfect sangria, and not one plate was a miss. Fantastic service with super friendly staff, and an eating experience as good as it ever gets.

Totally recommended."}
{"text":"Just finished having brunch here (had the Plato Combinado, which was amaze but the eggs were just a tad on the salty side..that's what she said) and loved it! The service, the view, the weather, the DJ and the overall feel were excellent.

So glad we stumbled across it while exploring Old Montréal :)"}
{"text":"Creative drinks and food.  Bartenders take time crafting the cocktails from scratch, food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Old Mtl, Tapas 24 is a tribute to Barcelona Cuisine both classic & modern by Chef Carles Abellan. Vibrant atmosphere great tapas but very pricey. Service was average but the food was excellent."}
{"text":"We so wanted to LOVE this place after visiting the Barcelona location 2 years ago. 
The food was 7/10 but the service was atrocious..

The first strike came when we ordered a bottle of Cava which arrived promptly...With 5 people at our table the server managed to fill 3 glasses to the brim but hadn't estimated how much wine was actually in the bottle, so 2 of us ended up with only half a glass each - no apology, no explanation.

We placed our order for several items and (assume we saw) our Ibirico platter was given to another table, then when we asked for it were questioned if we'd actually had it already of not!!! When it did finally arrive, the food runner who brought it up to the upper level had no idea who it was for and gave up trying to find who was supposed to have it so left it in on empty table. We finally attracted the attention of another server and they retrieved it for us.
The main server who was supposed to be looking after us would leave our table mid order/conversation to attend another table who flagged him over, then would simply forget to come back.

Our final bill at the end of the night came to well over $400.00. I think we can safely say  we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Nourriture de très bonne qualité mais portion assez petite pour des prix assez cher.
Dommage car le lieu est sympathique et chaleureux"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 2 stars for the service. It was horrible. Had to order everything twice to get it. And the waitress was clueless. Zero communication. Too bad cause the food was actually good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice & I've been wowed on both occasions. The decor is beautiful with mostly wood & dark metal with orange accents. The staff are efficient & on point.

I've eaten a variety of dishes & have enjoy almost all except one; the paella, it was way too salty but the flavours were deep & complex. The manda huevos con chirizo iberico is delicious, the jamon iberico was good, they're like the Carles Abellan's version of a poutine &I like it, a lot! 

The croqueta de pollo rustido was lovely but not out of this world. The cod croquette with maple syrup & lemon are delightful but my favourite are the la bombade barceloneta, so tasty!

The bikini dish reminded me of a grilled cheese but it didn't have the depth I was craving. The potatoes las bravas are fantastic. As for the desserts, I've only tried the crema catalan & it was good but I'm planning on having the manzana next time. 

I've had a good number of the cocktails & for the most part they were strong & stiff, just the way I like them! The kitchen closes at 23:00.

Try it out & bring your appetite but order wisely & order 2-3 dishes at a time."}
{"text":"5 stars for a tapas joint
3.5 stars for value 

It's tapas done very elegantly. We had a 2 person tasting menu coming up to $60 per person. 

The dishes were heads and tails above any tapas that I've had in Vancouver and various places in Spain for this price point.

Highly recommended if you enjoy high end Spanish tapas"}
{"text":"Best tapas I've had in Montréal. It has a very authentic vibe and the food is great if you like real Spanish tapas. Psss. Try the chef's tasting menu - custom everytime and amazing"}
{"text":"Went for the special 41$ Mtl a table tasting menu, we were really impressed by the amount of great food we were getting for 41$, until we got the bill and realized they were just sending us a bunch of tapas and charging us for them, even though we'd specifically requested the special. Needless to say getting blatantly screwed over put a damper on the evening. Wont be going back."}
{"text":"Had some time to grab dinner before heading to the AURA evening light show at the Basilica Notre-Dame last Wednesday, so we walked around Old Montreal and found Tapas 24. It was a little before 6pm, so not crowded at all. We were seated immediately. Interior is very modern looking. Staff is bilingual, pleasant and the restaurant accepts credit cards.

The four dishes we ordered we enough to fill two people up. Unfortunately, I can't remember the exact names of the dishes, so you'll have to enjoy the photos below, but the food was good! I would recommend if you are in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Great tasting tapas Spanish beers what else can you ask for. Try tasting menu if u r hungry"}
{"text":"Tapas 24 is a trendy tapas/Pintxos restaurant in Old Montreal run by three famous chefs.

Be sure to make your reservations early as this place is always busy. 

Dishes are small plates, meant to share.

My suggestion is to do the chef's tasting menu. They ask you what you like, if you have any food allergies or what you do not like. Then the parade of food begins...

I can't even tell you what all I ate, but it was all great!"}
{"text":"tapas 24 deserves this 5 star review.  I have been to the tapas 24 in Barcelona and loved it so I was happy to see that There was a secondary location. Me and my friend called the day before New Year's Eve in hopes to get a reservation last minute. Although they stated that it would be busy they could offer us a 5pm-7pm reservation if we didn't mind eating early. Being so last minute we were happy to get any reservation at a nice place so last minute.  

When we got to tapas 24 we were seated first thing and the menu was explained to us. We decided on the chefs choice type deal which I couldn't have been more impressed about! In addition my friend dining with us was a vegetarian and they were extremely accommodating. The amount of food and quality of food we received for the price was amazing! It was a night filled with laughs and good food! 

Go here if you want to try new things and enjoy tapas!"}
{"text":"This place gets stars for the deco. As for service, it wasn't bad either but for a place with prices like that, they could've been more descriptive.. or helpful. They didn't seem very motivated to work there. But onto the important stuff, the food.. which gets 1 star.

It wasn't painful to eat, but for the price you pay, it most certainly wasn't approaching good. We got the degustation menu - which I recommend you don't get as you leave feeling far from full. It doesn't even include dessert. It was abut 50 each before tax for the degustation menu which is decent but the food was not outstanding in any way. The presentation was decent but it tasted like appetizer plates from a cruise ship buffet left out for hours. The food was not fresh and tasted stale at times. Some portions even came cold and the meats were clearly left out for a long time. It had that leftover bbq taste and texture.

I feel like you could spend your money at better places because while I could be wrong, most of these items tasted like reheated and deep fried frozen portions plated in a decent manner."}
{"text":"I went to Tapas 24 for a friend's birthday. I think we were roughly 20 odd people. My bf and I shared all the tapas. The food was good but I've had better Spanish food/tapas elsewhere. We started off with the Mixta Iberico (Iberian sausage, chorizo and ham platter). I really wanted the Iberian ham... it's similar to prosciutto. It was good but I've had it better elsewhere. For example, the one at Bocata in the old port is delicious!!  The chorizo and sausage were nothing special. We ate the cold cuts with Coca con Tomate (coca bread - tomato - olive oil). It's basically a baguette cut up with olive oil and the juice of a fresh tomato. Normally I wouldn't order something so simple but the waitress recommended. It really filled us up and helped us coat our stomachs for all the alcohol to come so I guess it was a good idea. We had the Pinxo de Cordero Alhucemas (Quebec lamb brochette). It was so good! I loved the spice and how tender it was. I wish there had been more than one brochette. We also had the Mc Foie - Burger which was also very tasty. t was basically a hamburger with a sesame seed bun, beef patty, onion, and foie gras. They put the foie gras on the side and it was a good size. The burger itself was smaller than a regular hamburger but slightly bigger than a slider. To accompany the burger we got the las Bravas (triple cooked fries - aioli - brava sauce). They were thick rectangular fries... nothing special. I tried my friends Bikini de \"Carles Abellan Tramezzini. This was so yummy! Its basically a grilled cheese with Iberian ham,mozzarella di buffala, and truffles.

It was pretty packed on a Saturday and the music was good. I would come back for drinks and maybe one or two tapas for like a 5 a 7. Go with your colleagues or friends after work! The drinks were good. I want to go back and try their sangria.I tried the French Canadian Bloody Caesar which was made up of Gin Piger Henricus, clamato, lemon, and rimmed with steak spice. It's not often that I see a bloody Caesar with gin. Gin is my drink of choice so i was excited to try it and it did not disappoint! I also tried the Peruvian bloody Caesar which was also very good! It was made of Pisco, clamato and lèche de tigre. I had to google the latter because tiger's saliva seemed weird and unappealing to me... lol Thank god for google! ... \"Lèche de tigre is the Peruvian term for the citrus-based marinade that cures the seafood in a ceviche.\""}
{"text":"We went into Tapas 24 but ended up leaving before we were even served anything to eat / drink. I'm glad we did because we ended up next door at the sister site, Tapas 24 Snack Bar, and had a great time - but we almost walked away from Tapas 24 all together. We work in the area and are regular patrons who tip well - target market I would think - but no one cared when we walked out. When we arrived at tapas 24 restaurant, we were seated promptly by the hostess but none of the staff could tell us what the difference was between Tapas 24 restaurant and Tapas 24 snack bar (which are beside each other). The atmosphere was very uncomfortable. We had the impression that we were imposing, like they didn't want us there. There are no 5@7 specials to attract customers - the place was empty. Next door, at the snack bar, we discovered that there are 5@7 specials and a way more welcoming atmosphere. I will still patron Tapas 24 snack bar but I'll never give the restaurant another go. I don't want to sit through an extremely uncomfortable dinner, thanks. Plus, if the waiters can't explain what the difference is between the two restaurants who are clearly affiliated then they lose credibility. The hostess was outright rude - but then again I'd probably be cranky too if I had to wear a dress that tight and constricting. I'd rather dine in a place where people can confidently answer questions about the food and establishment. Was there ever a time where it worked to be snobby and elitist and exclusive in the restaurant industry?"}
{"text":"Awesome Tapas, not cheap but great quality.  Great Service, very cosy and lounge ambiance.  This place is a must stop ."}
{"text":"Before you read my review, you should know that when I went to Barcelona, this was my favorite restaurant... So my expectations were high and I was highly disappointed. 

Food is just not good. There are no other words. I tried more than half the menu... nothing was good. Even the patatas bravas, which could have been good, were a complete salt bomb... and I like salty. We were 3 and we were unable to finish that plate. 

Every dish was one noted. Nothing special. 

The paella was also a disappointment. The saffron tasted off to say the least... maybe it was burnt or a kind that I don't know. 

This is much more a bar than it is a restaurant.

I must say our waitress was very nice. So nothing bad to say about the service.

Basically, I am very sad that I didn't like it... I really wanted to love it."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Service was terrible.  If don't want to be asked for a second drink and want everyone's food to come out at different times, then give it a try"}
{"text":"Great place for good food n great music. 
Dimly lit nice atmosphere , the staff are very friendly and courteous to tourists , even help us to Ina a place to hang out after we ate ... Great food, good service and fantastic music !!!!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I was able to experience Tapas 24 on my most recent visit to Montreal. The food, atmosphere, and customer service was impeccable. 

We were lucky enough to have, what I can only assume, the restaurant manager and/or owner take care of our table. He created such a memorable experience for us, to which I am grateful, as we were celebrating a friends birthday. 

The food came out in a fantastic pace so as we were finishing one dish the next was just being placed on our table. Though I am not new to Spanish tapas, there were some \"firsts\" I experienced. The manager/owner ordered us a plate of liquid olives \"elBulli-style\" which is something I have never tried, nor, seen before - definitely a great experience. The croquettes are classically delicious, and I can honestly say I don't think there was one dish I didn't enjoy. Just make sure you save room for desert, the Buñuelo's are to die for! 

Thank you, Tapas 24, and I hope you plan to expand your restaurant to Toronto!"}
{"text":"This was not a great experience. The food was good enough (though not spectacular, and a little overpriced), but we were very unhappy with the service. One of our dishes didn't appear and we had to ask our server twice before it finally came to the table, well after the rest of the meal. We ordered wine at $12 per glass and were very suspicious that the amount poured was not the 6oz mentioned in the wine list. On returning home we were able to ascertain that we had only received about 3oz of wine, so we felt quite cheated. It was our error not to challenge the server at the time, so I advise others to be more upfront! I saw the same server pour larger quantities of wine for other customers, so I wonder whether we were taken advantage of because we were tourists."}
{"text":"A year ago I heard about how Chef Carles Abellan and his Tapas 24 concept was coming to Montreal. I didn't get a chance to visit any of his restaurants while in Spain so the notion of trying his cuisine at home was quite appealing. Finally, for the occasion of my grandfather's birthday, I found a good reason to head over.

Being a restaurant in Old Montreal, Tapas 24 certainly tries to make a impressive visually. With the front of the restaurant being entirely windowed, the major use of natural coloured wood on the walls and at the first floor bar makes the whole restaurant pop from the outside. The noise level was relatively loud but nothing abnormal for an Old Montreal restaurant. The service was pretty good for us throughout the night unlike some of what you can read elsewhere so I guess this can be hit or miss. In our case, we had absolutely no complaints.

Foodwise, we had originally planned to go for the MTL a table menu but decided instead to simply order from the regular menu and share everything in order to enjoy a greater variety of dishes. These are the perks of being a larger group in this instance. First up, a few staple items of Spanish tapas. There was the Coca con Tomato. Simple but oh so good. We then had the Iberian chorizo - freshly sliced and a perfect compliment to the bread dish. A spicy kick on top of the usual fattiness. The last of the staple trio was the patatas bravas. The fries themselves were nice and crispy but the key was the combination between the heat of the brava sauce and the creaminess of the aioli. These were so good that we had 3 separate orders over the course of the evening!

The next set of dish were a little more unique. First up, la bomb de Barceloneta - a potato and meat croquette topped with the same aioli and brava sauce as before. Pretty good overall. Each individual croquette was rather big - lots of potato and meat stuffed inside. Great crunch on the outside without losing any moisture inside.

Next up were the garlic shrimps with hot peppers. A solid dish but one that, compared to the rest, lacked any real punch or spark. Enough so that I even forgot to take a picture, so there you go. 

We also have the strangely named Bikini Comerc 24 which essentially are mini grilled sandwiches of tramezzini, Iberian ham, mozzarella di buffalo and truffles. Extremely delicious - the combination of iberian ham and cheese is always a winner... and that is even before we add the truffles. The only complaints are these were how small they were.

The tuna with ponzu sauce was a hit at our table. The tuna was beautiful - nice sized pieces well seasoned also. The ponzu added a nice hint of citrus to mix with the sweetness of the tomato. A light but well executed dish.

Next were the boneless chicken wings with alegre sauce. Here, my camera failed me due to poor lighting but take my word for it, they are worth ordering next time you visit. The chicken was wonderfully moist and tender - simply fell apart using a fork. Great dish.

The final main tapas was actually a main that we added - oxtail stew with potato puree. The oxtail was amazing. The meat and fat was so cooked down that the two bones in the plate appeared to have never had any meat on them once we pulled the meat off them. Beautifully meaty and fatty goodness.

Now, after all of the food, we may think that we were too full for dessert... and you would be wrong. There is always room for dessert, especially these ones. We went with three to share amongst the group. First, we had the molten chocolate fritters. Hot dark chocolate in a fried ball with some powdered sugar... what is there not to like!? They may be too tart for some as it is dark chocolate but delicious nevertheless.

The second option was fresh ricotta and honey- a huge contrast when compared to the previous dish. Personally I loved the combination - a fresh and light alternative to standard dessert options. The sweetness of the honey worked very well with the creaminess of the ricotta. May not be everyone's jam from a texture point of view but it worked for me.

Lastly, we have in my opinion the best of the group - chocolate, bread, olive oil and fleur de sel. Milk chocolate mousse with a hint of olive oil, a touch of salt and a crunchy crouton. Simple but so wonderful in execution. Loved every bit of this one.

All in all, with all the food and a few good bottles of wine, we left full and very satisfied of our experience at Tapas 24. The one stickler would be price point as this definitely wasn't a cheap evening. Be prepared to pay more than you probably expect. I saw a lot of negative reviews for this restaurant early on... other than the overpriced issue, I experienced none of what others have apparently faced here. In my eyes, Tapas 24 is definitely a worthwhile visit. It may not be Barcelona but I'll take it. I suppose that your mileage may vary however.

Cheers!"}

cocktails are delightful"}
{"text":"(Tapas 24 Snack Bar) My wife and I found this on a lark.  We were wandering the 'hood looking for a late lunch.  We saw the restaurant but thought it too swanky for how we looked (hey, we were wandering tourists).  But the idea of tapas really appealed to us.  Wait!  What's next door? The Tapas 24 SNACK BAR!  A few tables, some stools at the counter to the kitchen!  What? That's right. In we went and down we sat.  Immediately the smells and sights of the kitchen grabbed us.  We enjoyed the solomillo de ternera, the salchicon iberico bocadillo, the croqueta de jamon iberico. and the papas bravas.  all winners for us.  then some churros for dessert, and we were happily sated until dinner later that evening.  Perfect find."}
