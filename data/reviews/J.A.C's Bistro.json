{"text":"Excellent food, amazing service and a great location. What more can you ask for? Try the strip loin, perfectly seasoned and melt in your mouth tender. Save room to try the pecan pie mmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and service. Penne arrabiata wasn't bad, not the most flavorful and the sausage was kind of hard and chewy. They were nice enough to split the pasta into two dishes because we said we were sharing. Pecan pie was solid, but the creme brule is to dieee for. Really unique and amazing, get it. If not for the creme brule I would give it a 3.5"}
{"text":"Had dinner at JACS with friends and it was great. Not a large restaurant but nicely appointed. The service was friendly and efficient. Timely checks on how we were doing without being intrusive. The food  is very good. The grilled Calamari was tender and nicely seasoned. We had the days special -pepper coated beef medallions on a mushroom risotto and everyone enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend JACS for a good meal in pleasant surroundings. Not cheap but good value."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly and attentive staff. It is always a pleasure to return there and get spoiled. Thanks JAC's team! We went here today with a party of 4 for dinner. We enjoyed the soup feature, which was a seafood chowder. Very smooth and full of fish and flavour, excellent! Mains:  Spicy Orzo: fruity tomato flavour with this awesome spicy chorizo Beef Stroganoff: generous portion of well cooked rigatoni with silky mixed mushroom sauce and soft beef tenderloin tips Seafood pasta: generous portion of pasta with extra large shrimps, trout, salmon, mussels in a tomato sauce Gnocchi: rich silky Gorgonzola cream sauce with home made gnocchi and grilled asparagus  The food was executed very skilled and without flaws, just like we experienced in the past.  We will return soon..."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and have been very happy with the service, ambiance, and most importantly, the food.  This is a Lakeshore-class restaurant, transplanted to Kerr St.   Will say that although the interior is very nice, sitting on the patio in the summer is not quite as good...no fault of their own, but Kerr St itself is not conducive to a fantastic patio experience (too noisy, and not quite as upscale as being in downtown Oakville).  But if you plan to sit inside, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. We wanted to try somewhere different outside of Toronto. We decided on this place for our anniversary! It was a perfect experience away from the intense, fast speed of our everyday lives. A great way to unwind and let the experts in the kitchen and staff do there thing....no issues. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My GF and I had dinner there on Tue Sep 17. We were very pleasantly surprised to find many other diners, beautiful white linen tablecloths, and excellent service. The food was delicious. Perhaps the only issue is the strong favoring of cream sauces for the Italian dishes. I would have liked more tomato sauce based dishes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurant in town. Nice atmosphere with cozy setting. The food is delicious and fresh. Grill calamari is one of the best I've ever have. The dessert are to die for !!! Overall is excellent!"}
{"text":"Nice place, upscale with decent prices for the service and atmosphere.  Nothing terribly memorable food-wise though. The octopus was tasty, (although go to Agabi down the street and you'll have one of the best grilled octopus dishes in history)!  The lobster risotto was very tasty but the bacon was just a bit odd on the plate... Maybe hold on the strip of bacon garnished on top next time. The spicy chicken orzo was good but the flavors were very strong. Maybe that's what was billed on the menu but it lacked the subtlety of flavoring that you'd maybe come to expect from very refined cuisine. The creme brulee was really good though as a dessert. Why?  The brulee wasn't burnt... Or at least or didn't taste burnt. Heavy cinnamon in it to still give it plenty of flavor. And the creme was thick. Great texture.   So, yes. It was good. But it wasn't great. I liked, but I did not love. Yup. Pretty much just a nice, smiley yup."}
{"text":"Great food good service.  Will  be back. Had very nice evening with friends. All our meals excellent."}
{"text":"You know, I expected this place to be amazing from the reviews here and from how beautiful it is, looking in from the street. My Husband and I don't have a lot of money, so we saved up to go here for our anniversary.  Reading online, I was told this place was \"inexpensive casual\" - judge me if you will, but they have white cloth tablecloths and napkins - I've never seen a Denny's with those, nor dropped $100 on an appetizer and 2 meals there!   And while we had saved up for this \"treat,\" so we had the money to eat there, we found that the food left us disappointed. It was...okay. Mediocre. We had the brie for an appetizer, pop to drink and I had a steak while my Husband had the shrimp risotto. Neither of us felt any of it was something to write home about.  The atmosphere was lovely, and our server was friendly and kind. We had a window seat, so we could look out over Kerr St. It's worth a visit to experience the atmosphere.  I imagine people like us are not frequent patrons of establishments like this, mostly because we can't afford it - only the rich of Oakville would consider this \"inexpensive casual.\" Still, it's somewhere to try at least once."}
