{"text":"Based on the Yelp reviews I took my co-worker for lunch at Palmyra.  Wanted to try the Shawarma.  we both had the Chicken Shawarma sandwich and shared a Fatouche salad.  Excellent... service was friendly and quick. Food was amazing... really moist and good flavour.  Will definitely make this place a regular lunch place."}
{"text":"Great food. Good fresh meat with great selection of toppings. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Ask them to grill your meat before putting it in your sandwich"}
{"text":"I ate here weekly. Chicken salad on the rocks was my go to. They just changed ownership and this place has gone downhill already. The rice is completely different. I'm super disappointed. Time to look for a new lunch spot"}
{"text":"Coming all the way from North Carolina, I must say that this place is a must on your dining list while you're in the area. It was right down the street from our hotel and was open on a Sunday. The environment is very welcoming and the people are super friendly. My wife had the Kafta platter, I had the Lamb Chunk platter and my kids had the Chicken Shawarma kids meal. We were completely satisfied with the servings and the explosive flavors from all of the dishes we ordered. The Lamb Chunk was so tender that I could peel the meat off with my fork. I dressed it with the yogurt and topped it off with the delicious rice. The salad was made fresh and I enjoyed every bit of it. I am no food critic, but I love this place. I give them 2 thumbs up and 5 stars in my book. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! I had a mixed shawarma and there was barely any chicken for the price I paid. I read some of the reviews afterwards and realized that I should not have ate here. It was my first time and when I called the owner and explained how I felt he was rude and condescending. Would not recommend. The taste was gross as well. Makes me sick just thinking about it. Never again."}
{"text":"Wow! Just go there and eat. First time there with two coworkers.  We went in for take out and ended up dining in. We only have 30 min for lunch. We were in and out in 30 mins.  Huge plates of food. I had Kafka.  Two thumbs up. We were impressed.   Service was good too, everyone was polite and kind and smiling.  I will return."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service.  There are too many other choices in Toronto to bother with this place."}
{"text":"Tried this as its near the office and the food was good, clean and good service! Ordered the chicken salad which has great dressing. My friend got the chicken shawarma wrap which she said was delicious."}
{"text":"I'm going to say this is the best Mediterranean food I've ever had. Lived all over (NYC, DC, Chicago) and never had better. Work takes me to this godforsaken area of GMT, but thankfully I have this place to look forward to. The mixed shawarma was divine. The hummus great. Their bread is interestingly thin."}
{"text":"Great food, good pricing, and large portions! The Palmyra Plate has a little of everything in case you find yourself not able to narrow down your choice! I even had them kick up the spice a little more."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! The food is super tasty and the portions plentiful, and has family friendly atmosphere. My husband and I were traveling to Toronto for our anniversary and happened upon this little jewel. The owners are wonderful and so welcoming, you can tell that they take real pride in what they do. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"4.5 rating  I've had this place bookmarked for ages, and last week when it was later at night and my wife and I wanted a quick Mediterrranean place go to, I knew that it was a perfect chance to finally try Palmyra.  It's a nice spot that's fairly informal, but also more nicely decorated than most other Mediterranean spots with a similar price-range. As you might expect, wraps are just below the $10 range, and platters range from about $12-17.   Since it was after 9pm, I ensured that I ordered meat that would be cooked to order. I ordered the Palmyra platter, with the signature dish naturally being the largest. It includes 4 types of meat: shish taouk (chicken breast), beef Kafta, and beef and chicken shawarma - the former two being cooked to order, and the latter being kept warm in the steamed serving tray. Though the taouk and the kafta were my favorites, the shawarma still held up very well by being served at a good temperature and wasn't dried out. Equally as important, the flavour of the meat was wonderful.  The sides included: rice, salad, seasoned potatoes and pita. As a whole, everything was very enjoyable, but the salad was a bit over-dressed, and the potatoes were a bit cold. It doesn't surprise me given the time of night I was visiting, but it was the experience regardless.  I was with my wife and we also ordered the falafel platter. It was served with a massive portion of hummus - bathed in quality EVOO which I love, along with an equally large portion of salad. The falafel's were made to order and were right up there with some of the best I've had in the city. Aside from the olive oil it was served with, the hummus was great too and a perfect texture.  This was also served with pita, and when were were being served our food and presented with the pita, the server let us know that the cook was going to bring out another kind of bread as well. It turned out to be freshly made lavash.  4.5 stars as mentioned above, but will round up to 5 due some leeway for the potatoes given the time of night and for the bonus of the lavash (and I did not flash any Yelp creditials or even take pics of anything before it was offered).   Probably the best Mediterranean/Lebanese place I've been to in the West side in this price range."}
{"text":"I had catering for 35 ppl, grilled kabab, shish tawooq, Fatoosh,Taboulah,Hummos, rice, spice potato and matabel all were very very very fresh and tasty made, rich in flavours and portions, Garnish presentation was perfect too. The price was very reasonable. They follow up with me twice after delivery to insure their perfection. Yes I do recommend their catering, take out and in."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. The staff is friendly and attentive. Clean and the food was really good.  Best hummus I ever had ! The chef prepared a meal for me that wasn't on the menu. I was very grateful and impressed. My food was fresh and hot. Only minor thing, was our food came out at different times. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"You have to try this restaurant! The chicken shawarma is an amazing medley in an authentic wrap. I've eaten shawarma in 3 countries and this is the best. Friendly staff and excellent food. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This is an update to upgrade my rating from 4 to 5*.  I don't do this very often but I am compelled to do so because it's safe to say this is my new favorite place to eat near home, period.  While I will always have my favorite shawarma place by work (Zesty Pita - 2 locations), Palmyra is now a no brainer new favorite by home not just for Mediterranean food but for FOOD, period.    Yes, Palmyra has unseated Zet's as my favorite large portion, reasonably priced, close to home restaurant.  If you know me that's a pretty big title to take away because Zet's is like my jam but now Zet's will just become my late night 24 hour jam.  While I have not had all of the menu yet at Palmyra, I've had enough of it to know that their food and the care they put into it is special.  ALL their food is fresh.  Their servings are beyond generous and their pricing is more than reasonable.  The quality of their food and the way it's presented is top notch.  IMO for what Palmyra offers and for what they charge they put places like Paramount to shame.  Palmyra to me is the epitome of great food at a great value so I feel lucky they are so close to where I live.  The fact that my wife also loves this cuisine and loves this place as well it's safe to say we will frequent Palmyra pretty much forever.    I think if I say anymore I'll just sound like I'm gushing.  I can't say enough good things about this place without sounding like I'm obsessed with it.  It feels like this place is an amazingly well kept secret but I want to share it with everybody."}
{"text":"Delicious shawarma and salad! The hot tea was ok and the wait is a little long but worth it. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by while in town for the first time for work. My family is from Syria so I can be a tough critic of Middle Eastern food but I was so impressed by the food I had here. I ordered the falafel plate, which includes falafel, hummus and salad. I was warned that it may take a few minutes since the falafel was made fresh and I didn't mind. The falafel was light, crispy on the outside and so flavorful. The hummus had the perfect blend of garlic and lemon juice and the salad was also delicious! I would absolutely return and try the other menu items."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. I was at drive test and it had long wait time.  Decided to treat myself here. I was presently surprised by the freshness of food quality.  lady on the counter was really helpful in guiding on what to eat.  It's a must try"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious food!  Everything at this place is super fresh and delish. i eat here often, as i work in the area so i've tried many items on their extensive menu. if you have a few minutes order the kafta, its amazing. The owner is just the sweetest, kindest man. Could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken shawarma and falafel plates and they didn't disappoint ! Great flavour and decent portions! The potatoes are spicy and awesome, the salad is fresh and flavourful. The hummus is extra creamy! They even have a good kids menu! Nice new restaurant - we picked up- but it's a nice atmosphere for a dinner or lunch in as well!"}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem on yelp (thank you fellow Yelpers!).  Opted for a take out falafel plate and a piece of baklava - t'was delicious. Falafel were tender, not dry at all and super flavourful. Loved the hummus and the pickles, so good. Salad was super fresh and the dressing was very yummy. Only complaint is there was slightly too much dressing on the salad so next time will request it on the side.  Baklava was also very very good - flaky but not overly sweet, really enjoyed it.  Want to return to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"We got the beef and chicken shawarma dinner. It was great and the rice and potatoes were yummy and flavorful.  The falafel was best I've had.  Great food for the price point."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Hampton Inn near the Toronto airport and Palmyra was 2 minutes away from the hotel. I ordered a chicken shawarma wrap combo which came with a drink and Greek salad. The wrap was very large and tasty. Service was very quick and I was full and satisfied after my dinner. If you are staying in the Hampton Inn or Homewood Suites, you could walk here to get a nice meal without a car."}
{"text":"I had the falafel dinner plate here and was impressed. It came with a nice salad, very good humus, and falafel balls that were not and crispy but not oily at all. The pita that came with it could have been a bit better, but it was still an excellent and reasonably wholesome meal."}
{"text":"Salads and chicken were very fresh. Great sit down service as well.  I will try the rice next time."}
{"text":"I was searching for a place to eat for lunch a couple weeks ago. I saw this place. It wasn't  busy at all. I went up to order and the lady did not speak much English at all. It was hard to order cause she couldn't understand me.  After I made my order I sat down and the owner of the place brought me my food. He was a nice guy and had a smile on his face. I asked him for some garlic sauce for my food and he kindly brought it to me. The food itself was mediocre. It had to much of this spice thats used in Mediterranean food. The garlic sauce looked like old butter that's been sitting out in room temperature. It didn't look appetizing. It was different than most Mediterranean food places I go too.  After I finished I was nice enough to bring my plate back to the counter. It was a different girl that took my plate. She asked me if I payed for my food. She would know if the staff was working together. She was kind of rude and did not smile. That was it. I went to the washroom and when I left. Not even a smile or goodbye to show there appreciation. They just stared and talked in there language which is kinda rude.  Customer service sucks. The food was just okay. I don't think I would visit this place again, just because of horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fantastic customer service.  Also the music was wonderful.  The portions are very large as well.  And I really appreciated the prices, especially in light of the quality and quantity.  We had a large group and they took care of very quickly."}
{"text":"It's not the same anymore seems like the owners may have changed? The quantity and quality has gone down the drain. Was a regularly customer before. Probably will not be going be back again."}
{"text":"A quite decent choice of freshly prepared food. We have been there few times and always found food quality constantly good.  Service is good, food is fresh and delicious, the place is clean and well lit. Ample parking space in the plaza. Definitely a place to be recommended."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Mediterranean restaurants around. I often order the family platters for office lunches and everyone loves the food. Tarek, the owner always accommodates to our needs. The shawarma, kofta and shishtawouk are all on point. If you like baba ganoush, you must try their mutabbal, It is out of this world and better than any baba ganoush I've ever tasted. Affordable prices too."}
{"text":"Came here because of the review and the food was as expected.  As soon as we walked in we were welcomed in with a smile and awesome service.  We ordered a couple chicken shawarma meals and they were very tasty.  There were a couple other things on the menu that popped out at me and I'll for sure be returning.  Great spot and great food!"}
{"text":"I work in the area so go there quite often. Their customer service is excellent! They always welcome you with a big smile and do their best to make your order asap even during busy lunch hours in a commercial area...you must try their platters...specially their chicken on the rocks! They chicken is marinated well and tastes great! They meal tastes fresh."}
{"text":"It is so difficult to find good falafel. I've been on a painful quest to find good falafel for so many years. Finally found it at this place!! It is absolutely delicious. It's tender with a nice crunch, not dry or mushy. Great flavours. Reminds me of falafel I've had in the Middle East as a child. They take their time making it but it's all worth it for some tasty falafel!  Strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just had the best kababs in town. I was driving around and found this place on Yelp. The owner was sooo nice and told u about his signature plate. The best kabab plate in town. My fiance that is usually very picky also loved their food, to my surprise. Definitely a highly recommend place."}
{"text":"Food was spectacular here. It was also priced well considering portion size. Way better than paramount. Authentic and delicious. Chicken was juicy and flavorful. Kebab was cooked just right. White sauce was provided generously and the menu had lots of options to choose from. I got the chicken shawarma plate and was not disappointed.   The only downside was service. Not very attentive or friendly. While having our meal the young couple that worked there were getting awkwardly cozy with each other by one of the tables beside us. We had to interrupt their love fest to get our final bill.   Overall - good food. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I have read so many good reviews about this place, and I was extremely disappointed with my experience. The place is not as clean as I expected, though the staff are welcoming. I ordered a shawarma sandwich, the chicken was saggy and greasy, i was expecting it to be crispy, the spices wasn't a good shawarma spices. And the bread wasn't pressed to have crunchy texture. The order comes with garlic potatoes which was greasy and mushy, the taste wasn't bad but this s not what i paid for and read about. If you are a real fan of middle eastern shawarma this s not the place to visit. And it s not cheap place also."}
{"text":"Even though they serve the same type of food, Palmyra is everything that Paramount is not.  Palmyra isn't very high traffic (at least not on a weekday evening), your food is brought to you, but it is in a more casual atmosphere, friendly, family-run staff, and the food is FRESH.  Basically, it's a pared-down Paramount.  (Paramount tries to up their game by having their restaurants all-fancy 'n stuff, but if you think about it, it really isn't necessary.  Besides, I think with their expansion, both food & customer service has fallen to the wayside.)  Anyway, place was fairly dead when I visited on a Thursday evening for dinner.  This area is just very industrial and I'm guessing the neighbouring businesses are meant more for the lunch crowd.  I was given a paper takeout menu to help me with my decision making, but I basically took fellow Yelper, Lambert's suggestion and got the Palmyra Plate ($16.99).  It's a total no-brainer as it has an array of meats:  pieces of Grilled Chicken kabob, kofta, both chicken/beef shawarma all on a bed of rice with seasoned roasted potatoes & a side salad.  I shared that with a friend and I made the mistake of ordering a Fattoush salad (~$6) before that.  All in all, we had leftovers!  I enjoyed everything that I ate, especially the potatoes - great seasoning & they're spicy!  Grilled Chicken kabobs were also really good and tender.  No complaints, spicy sauce served on the side was very nice.  Prices, especially for the meats are slightly on the high-side, especially considering its casual atmosphere, so there's a tip jar on the side.  When you're done, you go up and pay at the cash.  If you're in this area, definitely check out this place for something relatively fast, but not fast food!  Too bad that it's in a low-traffic area, otherwise I'm sure that they'd be busier."}
{"text":"Great service. Very fresh, large portions, food was delicious! Ordered the kafta plate and falafel plate. Potatoes were a little spicy but overall everything was made from scratch and delicious."}
{"text":"Tried them out for the first time for dinner tonight, and the food was fantastic! Had the shawarma chicken dinner, which came with potatoes, rice, and salad, and I am stuffed! The   chicken was tender, and the potatoes came with chili flakes on them - sooooo good! Haven't had good shawarma like this in a long time. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I was craving shawarma one day while in Missisauga and found Palmyra on SkipTheDishes. I ordered a beef shawarma dinner, and it was delicious! The beef was flavourful, the rice was fluffy, and the sauces were decadent. This place is a bit off the beaten path, but it's definitely up there when it comes to my favourite shawarma!"}
{"text":"Good food prepared fresh by smiling staff behind the counter. Tried the veggie falafel sandwich and thankfully it had more of the balls than some other joints. It was grilled to perfection. It came with a salad in combo which I wasn't too happy with. Was a little to sour for my taste. Will definitely be coming again and recommend others to check it out."}
{"text":"Wow! Some of the best Middle Eastern food I've had in the GTA! Their sandwiches are packed full of flavour and the dinner plates are huge. Their meat is amazing, the shish taouk is so juicy. Amazing. Their hummus is creamy and delicious. The only problem is it's location for transit bound Torontonians, being out in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Better choice than Paramounts in my opinion. The owners seems to always be there whenever I drop by, and they're very nice and friendly people that always serve you with a smile. The portions are fairly generous. Food tastes great."}
{"text":"I care here for a leisurely lunch on my way to the airport. The restaurant is tucked into a strip mall, and it actually has two separate parts: a manakish & juice bar on the left and the full restaurant on the right - so make sure you enter the one on the right (unless you actually just wanted manakish and juice).  The restaurant is more \"fast casual\" and has the option to either order at the counter or sit down at tables with a menu. If you order at the counter, you can also get your food to go. But I wasn't in a rush, so I chose the table option. The restaurant was relaxed and not very busy - though maybe it picks up more in the evening.  The restaurant owner was friendly and gave some helpful recommendations. I ended up getting the lamb shank plate, which was well prepared and came with a generous portion. I also had a wonderful baklava for dessert. Everything was attractively plated, too.  It was a nice experience overall, and for a reasonable price. Check it out if you're in the mood for some nice Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Discovered this place during a business trip thanks to the tellers, and honestly it is a hidden gem, big portions, tastes good, very friendly staff and owner, make you feel like you own the place, I loved it."}
{"text":"They do not deliver!  advertise delivery, even downloaded the app but then the app won't let you pick delivery and when you call they confirm. NO DELIVERY!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago but came down to Toronto for a business trip. Best Mediterranean food I have had so far. You can tell that it's made with passion. Definitely going to have some more before I leave. You have got to check this place out, and if you don't know what to order, let them pick for you!!"}
{"text":"This review is my 400th! Crazy, huh? It is fitting that this restaurant serves outstanding food to mark my milestone. =)  Our team goes out for lunch on Fridays. Last Friday, we visited this fine restaurant. It is located in a crazy, high-traffic strip mall that includes a drive-thru Tim Horton's. There are also a bunch of nervous drivers trying to pass their driving tests.  Palmyra has a decent number of seats when we got there at noon. We occupied a table for four. A server came over, made food suggestions, and took our orders. We sat at table 9.  My manager and two co-op students ordered water. They thought that they'd be getting free water in glasses. Nope, they got bottled water that went for $1.50 each. The moral of the story is that if you want free Etobicoke water, indicate that you want water in a glass.  As for me, I didn't have that issue. I ordered a Diet Coke, which came in a can.  I ordered the kafka dinner. It came with rice, salad, two skewers of kafka (beef), and roasted lemon potatoes. I normally don't care much for potatoes these days. However, they were delicious! I ate them all up. Frankly, if I could lick my plate clean, I would have. I just needed to look like I was a civilized person.  My colleagues ordered the beef shawarma wrap, chicken on the rocks, and chicken and beef shawarma dinner. They all loved their food.  The food was tasty and authentic. I felt like I was in Istanbul again. Yummy.  I can see what folks like this place more than Paramount. I would have to agree.  I can't wait to come back here.  (80)"}
{"text":"On a quick lunch break from my office I decided to order the chicken shawarma combo, but got a salad instead of the fries. The chicken shawarma itself was flavourful, I would have added a little more sauce though. The ingredients were fresh and the service was quick, they even served the food right to your table! The salad was very plain, I regret not having the fries as they were tasty (took some from a colleague).   Overall, worth coming here again for the shawarma!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great waitress. Large portions, tasty and authentic, we had the falafel plate with farnoush salad, and the lentil soup.  It was all wonderful, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars... its so hard to rate this place because the favours were great on some items but overall, it seemed so disorganized and some items were not well executed.  I was dying for a good meal especially after a long day of travel and I've had Palmyra on my radar for a while.  Seeing how it was near the airport, I was thinking it would be the perfect spot especially seeing how they've had some amazing reviews.  It pains me to give less than 4 stars because it's clearly a family run place but comparing it to another family run spot (Pho Ngoc Yen), it's a very different experience.  The restaurant is more fast casual which would be ok if it was clean... there were entire tables with old food and dirty dishes just littering the entire area.  The floor underneath the 'cleaner' tables had old food. It just seemed.... disorganized.  The ordering was haphazard and I think they were busy with the 2 tables already sitting and waiting for food.  Also, the older lady didnt pack the food but said it was done so the other staff (family members) were confused on where everything was.  Prices are fair and very reasonable for the amount of food but the execution of the food is where I sighed a bit.  If only there was a bit more care... it would have easily a 4 star.  Falafel dinner (with fries, pickles, hummus, tabbouleh) - I'll start with the good... flavour.  It's all there and you can tell it's done by them.  The herbs and spices in the falafel were great.  Unfortunately it was cold and hard... like over fried and then placed on a plate for hours.  The tabbouleh salad had a great citrus kick and was very good.  The pickles were a nice compliment but the fries... pale, limp, and underseasoned.  It was just sad.  If they just cooked the falafel fresh and redo the fries to their crispy happy state, easily one of better falafel dishes but ... it wasn't.  3.5/5  I wish I could give it higher as it seems like great flavours but just lacking on execution."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  And the people are nice.  It was a little confusing, when you walk in, there are no signs as to where to place an order, if you sit down before ordering or go to the counter.  I wasn't sure if I grabbed a drink from the cooler or if they were going to ask me what I wanted to drink, so I ended up eating my entire meal without anything to drink. I just felt uncomfortable like I was doing the process wrong. Next time I go order takeout order delivery."}
{"text":"Found this place for dinner near my airport hotel and was not disappointed!! The food was amazing and the service was friendly and great. Will definitely stop by next time I'm in the area. The hummus was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I had chicken dinner ( shredded chicken, salad, potatoes and basmati rice ) which was so delicious ! I literally cleared up my plate !  Just view other peoples' comments ! You won't be disappointed ! ( unless chef decides to quite his job :p )"}
{"text":"What a little gem! I couldn't believe that this place was empty on a Saturday night after reading the reviews. The food here is amazing and high quality! We had the shish touwuk dinner and the mixed shawarma dinner with hummus and tabouleh salad. The flavours were incredible and the portions were more than satisfying. I'm actually craving the rice with tahini and hot sauce right now. Service and atmosphere were also top notch. Love this place I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I (4 adults & a child) tried this restaurant based on positive YELP reviews and we were not disappointed. 12 minutes from our hotel and the food was fantastic. Directions sent from YELP app to Google maps was slightly off on the location . It had us turn into a business area a half block away but we figured it out. We saw the big red lettered sign out front. The restaurant was nice inside and appeared clean and was nicely decorated. The girl who took our order explained the platters when we asked. Service was good considering the language barrier. We had a Palmyra platter, mixed shwarma platter, 2 falafel platters, and a lentil soup. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and delicious. Salad was cold and crisp. Meat was hot and tender. Rice was perfectly cooked. We would all go back to this place if any of us visit this area again. Also, we were able to pay with credit cards which was a necessity for us while traveling."}
{"text":"Lunch, or dinner. This place delivers!  Shwarma sauce and grilled meat is on point!  Always just at lunch hour so expect to wait. But the service is pretty good."}
