{"text":"Located behind Pacific Mall, Chung King Garden serves an excellent full-course Peking Duck in record time. Every dish was fantastic, and the duck was crispy, non-fatty, and flavourful. Knowing that it takes 20-30 minutes for the food to be prepared, we ordered one of their House Specials to tide us over as well as some white rice.  Szechwan Shredded Beef ($10.95 )Crispy yet tender, crunchy but not oily, this was the perfect dish to ease our hunger pangs while we waited for the duck. I was really pleased with the beef; it had great flavour from the chili and it wasn't drenched in sauce so it stayed crispy. Shredded carrots and green onions added to the flavour, and it was great with rice.  Authentic Beijing Roast Duck (3 Courses) ($37.95) 1. Crispy Duck Skin & Breast 2. Duck Stir Fry 3. Duck Soup  Course 1: Crispy, Roasted Skin I could hardly contain my excitement when the first course arrived. The dark skin was shining and crispy-looking, with duck breast peeking out from underneath.The flavour was fantastic. There was also little to no fat hiding between the skin and breast, which but they've rendered it so well that it was still moist. With it came steamed dry crepes to wrap the roasted duck, vegetables, tian mian jian (a savoury-sweet bean sauce), and crispy shrimp crackers. The crepes are nice and thin, but thick enough to wrap everything without breaking before shoving it into your mouth. Eat the crackers while they're super-fresh and hot - like pork rinds, they get soft and blah over time.  Course 2: Minced, Fried Duck in Lettuce Wraps There were also bits of crispy white noodles hidden among the pile of stir fried duck, vegetables, and saucey goodness. The sweet bean sauce is a great base for stir fries, and II enjoyed tofu, water chestnuts, pepper, carrots, onion, and whatever other vegetables were in the mix. There was just enough to give it flavour, and they clearly weren't just \"fillers\" for the dish to look bigger. We eagerly grabbed spoonfuls and scooped the duck into pieces iceberg lettuce. I also enjoyed it with white rice when we ran out of lettuce. Win.  Course 3: Duck Soup Last to arrive was a soup made from the remaining skin, meat, and bones. The broth was surprisingly light and tasty - not at all oily! A friend said this was her favourite course for this very reason. I really wonder what they put in this broth to make it so flavourful in such a short amount of time. Tofu, duck, and nappa cabbage was plentiful and we cleaned this bowl up without a problem. I can only imagine how wonderful this soup must be on a cold, winter night."}
{"text":"Ordered the Peking Duck.  The waitress brought it out to show you the whole duck before carving it up.  When they brought out the sides that accompany the duck, I was disappointed that there is a huge disproportion of wraps compared to the carved duck skin, I mean almost 5 duck skins to 1 wrap, like they weren't making enough profit off you so they intentionally give you less wraps because you will ask for more and they charge you for more wraps - thus my 2 stars and not 3 for my review for this point.  Other restaurants don't charge you when you ask for more wraps!  Taste wise it wasn't any better than other restaurants I tried duck.  Their dishes other than duck are a better choice as it's heavy on flavour and sauce typical of northern Chinese cuisine.  Second, typical of some Chinese restaurants and this one is no exception, they don't take credit cards.  I'll go elsewhere for these 2 reasons when I'm in the mood to have duck"}
{"text":"I recommend that anyone wishing to go order the duck only. It's the only dish on the menu I was not revolted by. We had a set course meal and virtually every dish was awful, overcooked, bad ingredients or all of the above. It's hard to mess up the second course duck dish with lettuce wraps. They accomplished it. The soup was awful. The opening dish served cold was excruciating. The beef dish was like Taco Bell beef - where's the beef! The fish tasted like it was 2 weeks old and drowned in some sauce - thank god for the sauce because it masked the taste.  The fried rice was worse than food court fried rice. Honestly, I can cook a better fried rice.  Here's how bad the fish was - no one ate it. Everyone tasted it. Spit it out. No one ate it.  On top of that, the entire meal was $250 after tax and tips. For that amount of money, you could have had a far better meal at say Honey and Garlic or Keung's Delight, and far cheaper.   Sorry to say, but out of the entire group of us there (8 in total), we are unanimous in saying it was the worst restaurant we've been to."}
{"text":"What a royal treatment!   I have to admit that I was hesitant and skeptical at first about going to the King because firstly, this one happens to be 30 min driving distance away from me and secondly, there are something like 47 chinese restaurants at every corner in Toronto. But I did go because someone in the group promised that this place serves THE BEST Peking Duck in GTA. And boy... this place is goooood!  This is no fancy restaurant (most chinese restaurants aren't) but both the food AND the service are fit for a king!   I was there with a group of 10 and the service was lighting quick. We got our 8 dishes within 20 min! I truly enjoyed every single dish we ordered! My favourites were the Peking Duck (of course!), Peking Duck stir fry, the orange garlic beef, and the deep fried sweet and sour fish.   I highly recommend this place, but if you're going with a group make sure you call ahead to make reservations as this place is packed!  P.S. This place is cash only."}
{"text":"Best Peking Duck I've ever had at any restaurant! This place is very popular for it! Everytime I come here, every single table has an order of the Peking Duck course. When served the duck , it actually had meat on it compared to other places that give only the skin part of the duck. It was fabulously delicious and filling! I love their szechuan tofu, it's just amazing! It also takes awhile for the Peking Duck to be served depending on how packed the restaurant is, and today it was PACKED! Other then that I will definetly be going back!"}
{"text":"Not good.  I recently came here on a weekday afternoon, fondly remembering my childhood visits to Chung King in downtown Toronto. Needless to say, those memories were not revived.  I'd give the food about 2/5. Not horrific but pretty bad. Oversauced, watery and tasteless. Poor customer service- no water refills. When the bill came, we were told by the waitress that only cash was accepted. Mind you, there was absolutely no signage anywhere in the restaurant (or out front) that this was the case.   Not a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent duck and reasonably priced.  We also enjoyed other dishes as well, esp. the cod dish and chicken in Chinese styled pancake pockets.  Note the place is not big and they don't take reservation for a table less than 5 people.  The place gets very very busy at times, so do make a reservation if there are 5+ at your table.  They also don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"Located in Market Village, Chung King Garden ??? reminds me what a Northern Chinese restaurant looks like in the early 90s in Hong Kong. It is clean and tidy, and the service was great.   This place was already packed when we arrived at 6pm on a Saturday. We ordered the crispy beef to start. Then we have the signature 2 course Peking Duck. The skin is crispy and the meat is not greasy. It comes with the green onion, cucumber, and also Chinese style crepe. The second course was minced with vegetables served with lettuce cups. It has an excellent savoury flavoured minced duck meat mixture balanced out with the refreshing lettuce Wrap. One whole duck easily serves 4 people. It is arguably the the best Peking Duck in the Toronto! We also order the Lamb Soup Pot. It is a perfect soup for cold winters in Toronto to nourish your body. To end with, the taro sweet soup is a true delight. If you are planning to come during weekend, be sure you make a reservation."}
{"text":"\"Every time I eat here, they give me a fork,\" sarah l. said. \"Maybe if I go with you they'll give me chopsticks.\" So we went here for dinner and guess what? They also gave ME a fork. That was a first for me. (Sarah l. needs to stop diminishing my Asian cred.)  Another first for me was having orange chicken--much to sarah l.'s shock and disbelief. I always thought orange chicken was battered deep-fried chicken pieces in a sticky-sweet glaze, which never appealed to me. Not so at Chung King. The chicken is stir-fried in a gingery soy sauce mixture. The first bite is delicious but then the flavors of the smoky, hot Szechuan peppers and mildly bitter dried orange peels kick in. I couldn't stop eating this dish.  The Szechuan shredded beef is also very good but it was out-shined by the clucker.  The hot & sour soup ($3.50) for a \"small\" is enough for four people. It was good but we couldn't finish it once the meats came out.  All this plus two Tsing Tao beers and spring rolls with enough chicken and beef for each of us to take home cost $40 + tip. Amazing.  While we were there, we saw groups come in for their Peking duck which gave me a horrible case of food envy. I think I need to come back here and rekindle my duck lust http://www.yelp.ca/biz/silver-spoon-toronto#hrid:wytHA7RsmUb4WUk3UcXH1Q"}
{"text":"This review is just for the Peking duck. When I came in here, I was skeptical... Saw a lot of people ordering spring rolls, which made me question the authenticity of the duck that I was about to order. And the price was about $10 more than what a typical duck goes for so things looked a little suspect to me.  But when the duck arrived, it was crispy, not greasy or fat, smoky, and tasty! Almost better than the duck I had in Beijing... Almost. The pancakes were also thin and light, unlike other Peking duck places that have the floury, packaged, doughy stuff. You can tell they handmake their pancakes because they're all different sizes and shapes...  The lettuce wrap was an even better surprise! The duck tasted like it was smoked in charcoal or tea leaves??? Dunno what they did, but it was amazing! Go for the duck I promise you it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy chicken, mapo tofu and moo shu pork.  The mapo tofu is pretty good and tasty.  I didn't like the spicy chicken, it lacks flavor.  The moo shu pork is good but with only 4 wrappers.  Overall, I am satisfied with the place, price and the food.  dishes will cost you between 9 to 15 dollars.    In fairness, we didn't order the house specials so I can only review this place based on the food I ordered."}
{"text":"Veddy Interesting place..  I walked in expecting a normal Chinese restaurant considering it was in Market Village...  It was filled with non-asians.  Ready to walk out, we decided to sit down and try it.  After all.. yelp reviews can't let me down right?  We ordered Hot & Sour soup, dry saute green beans, chicken with peanuts, schezuan shredded beef. The soup was good, both hot & sour taste!  Small size is perfect. Green beans were okay.. have had much better elsewhere... chicken was great, and beef was very different.  The food is very heavy on the oil.. so its not exactly the healthiest stuff. Next time we'll try the peking duck.    They give you fortune cookies at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"I've been to Chung King twice. Both times I tried a variety of dishes and found all the food (especially their crispy beef) to be very delicious. The prices are very reasonable as well.  My favourite part of Chung King is the service. I'm not used to going to a Chinese restaurant and getting good service. The atmosphere is calm, the staff is very friendly, I don't have to ask for my glass to be filled with water. This is stark contrast with almost all other Chinese restaurants in Toronto in my experience.   I will continue to go back as I've enjoyed both visits immensely."}
{"text":"I only order one thing from this restaurant and that's the peking duck. I've been to this place about 7 times and have ordered over a dozen peking ducks. I have had peking duck at pricier restaurants but this is my favourite (so far).  I have three expectations for a \"good Peking Duck\": 1) The skin has to be CRISPY with a good roasted colour 2) The meat has to be TENDER and JUICY and flavourful 3) Unlimited hoisin sauce (at no charge!)  I'm serious about #3. What's peking duck without hoisin sauce?! Anyways, I think out of the dozen or so times I ordered the peking duck, only twice was the skin slightly under the crispy side.   I almost always order the two-course duck since I'm not a big fan of soup (that comes with the three-course). They give enough wraps/pancakes/crepes for the first course and usually not enough lettuce wraps for the second course. Feel free to ask for more, though I can't remember if they charge you extra. One order of the two course duck is enough for three people, maybe four if you order another dish.  If you plan on going Friday/Saturday night during peak hours, it would be best if you made a reservation. The place can get pretty packed at night."}
{"text":"Go to place for Peking duck.  This restaurant can be pack on the weekend.  Went there few days ago, and service has gotten downhill and their food portion has been reduced noticeably."}
{"text":"I've been regularly eating here for years. It is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants! We have a few \"usuals\" we always get: 2 course Peking duck, Szechuan shredded beef (crispy beef), and dry sauteed green beans.    The Peking duck first course has crispy skin and also some meat included on some pieces.  Comes with hoisen sauce, green onion, cucumber, and of course the pancakes.  Always delicious. Second course Peking duck is the rest of the meat chopped up and sauteed, served with lettuce to wrap it.  Szechuan shredded beef is the best crispy beef ever.  Dry sauteed green beans are cooked with chili and garlic and are awesome. The crispy beef and green beans are occasionally a little inconsistent (so 1 star off), but usually really good. We've tried other things as well that have been good, but these are our staples (and most other people's too, because they're seen on nearly every table).  Prices are good too.  A bunch of people can eat a lot for not a lot of money.  I've never had poor service here, but don't expect to be doted on in this type of place. If you go often enough to where they recognize you, they get friendlier. Cash only."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Peking duck in Toronto!  Lean, tasty duck, sliced just right.  We also ordered Singapore vermicelli, which was really flavourful, and fresh mixed vegetables.  There was a lot of food, so we got to take some home. Good service, which is very important to note as we plan to return another time. The only drawback was the grotty washroom, which doesn't go well with the delicious food.  Try not to go to the washroom as that may give you an awful last impression."}
{"text":"Chung King Garden, (hopefully not in any way associated with Hong Kong's infamous Chung King Mansions)  is another of my SO's family favorites.  This place holds a place in his heart, and rightfully so. Its the \"Pekeng Duck place\" The place that we take ANYONE who even mentions that \"I haven't tried real\" or \"I do not like\" Chinese food. This is more the real-deal than anything and is a seriously delightful experience.  *Disclaimer* I do not eat duck. And a Hoisin-sauce-filled lettuce wrap just isn't enough for me. So as I see my dining companions drooling over, eyes rolling, mouth watering, lip smacking over the duck I cannot actually provide an opinion on the duck itself.  That being said, the other offerings that I have sampled on the menu satiate my lack-of-duck-tasting-tastebuds.  For anyone that doesn't know the first thing about Peking duck, you order it in either two or three courses. Read Erin K's post below for duck laden details. Me+crew generally go for the  \"two course\" with an order of crispy fried beef.  I (don't eat beef or duck) enjoy the whole fried fish with their version of a sweet and sour sauce, several of the shrimp dishes, saute green beans, pea shoots and their soft tofu dishes.   They barely speak English, its true. They only take cash, yes, thats true too. The service is not exactly attentive. However, we usually go in groups of 4-6 and Our bill is generally in the $100 or less range including duck and doggie bags.  Everyone is always extremely impressed with their meal and it is a lot of fun to bring our friends. As per anything Pacific Mall, there is plenty of parking but it does get busy, and this restaurant is the same. Come at off-peak hours. Large round tables for large-ish groups. I haven't been given a fork yet."}
{"text":"I am introduced to this restaurant with some skepticism.  I have always been there in the Pacific Mall or Market Village but I never notice there is such a restaurant.  By the outside look of it, it is a old style Chinese restaurant.    I order the Peking duck with 2 courses.  The duck is shown to us before BBQ.  That's why it will take a bit longer.  The skin is so crispy and not oily.  It is one of the best one in town.  The meat is minced and stir fried.  We do not have enough lettuce for the minced duck.  It surprises to us each extra one cost $0.50.  It is a bit disappointed that the lettuce given to us are flat and not curl.  The taste though is good.  The ginger beef is crispy and taste good.  The vegetarian pot is good too.    During the weekday, it is not that crowded"}
{"text":"The Beijing duck was amazing. Very crispy skin and tender meat. The 2 course duck was more than enough for three of us. We also tried the crispy beef which I'd highly recommend. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"After having watched Anthony Bourdain eat Peking Duck on his show, I knew I had to have some.I've never been a big fan of duck meat, but this crispy bird just sounded delicious!   My friend finally brought me here (surely so that I would stop bugging her with my constant requests). I was super excited to try this - and I was not disappointed!   We had the 2 course Peking Duck and I enjoyed both dishes equally. The duck skin was crispy,tasty and just delicious!And when wrapped around the pancakes (which reminded me of tortillas) doused with sauce and some green onions - it composed the perfect bite.   The second dish was the chopped up duck meat mixed with a variety of veggies and water chestnuts and it was awesome. It was great that this came with lettuce leaves to eat it on, but I could have eaten this stuff by itself!   We also got a sizzling plate of beef which I didn't enjoy much. There was something about the texture of the meat that I just didn't like. The Seafood in Taros Nest on the other hand was great, and I particularly enjoyed the crispy taro nest - it tastes like potato chips. Yum.   I can't wait to have me some more Peking Duck soon!"}
{"text":"We've been going to the Pacific Mall location for years - albeit only for their lunch specials - and when we pulled in and saw they were closed we were devastated. Drove up to read the notice on the door and were thrilled to find out they're even closer to us now. Great new location. Nice and clean. Now take debit/credit cards. I'm afraid we've still only gone there for lunch - szechuan shredded beef with steamed rice, spring roll and hot and sour soup - for roughly $10.  Amazing! We've tried other options as well - spicy green beans, shrimp, etc, but we really love the szechuan shredded beef. That said, now that they're closer, we'll likely try to get there for dinner and try their famous Peking Duck."}
{"text":"Peking Duck is, no doubt, one of the best, but service in this place is just plain BAD. I've been there a few times but after last Sunday Sept 28th, 2014, we won't be going back. Service is consistently careless, and painfully slow. We waited over 40mins for our second duck course, which, with children, it's just a nightmare. Before sept I was there in May, and exactly the same story, but at the time we just walked out without the second course, promising not to come back. We gave it another chance but again it was very disappointing and the ladies running the show, couldn't care less. I can't wait for another place to take that 'Best Peking Duck' crown from this place...."}
{"text":"Delicious! Their Peking duck is worth braving the Pacific Mall parking lot for. We had the three course duck; the soup is very flavourful. Staff was friendly although we spent some time waiting for our food. Make sure you book ahead of time if you're coming on a weekend night. We went early and didn't have any problems but the restaurant was quite filled as the evening rolled on."}
{"text":"Came for their Beijing roasted duck. $40 for 2 courses. The restaurant was under staffed for Mothers Day, however the servers did their best.  This place does not carve the duck table-side, however, they will bring the duck out after its been roasted, and before it is sliced.   Course 1 arrives with the wraps, hoison sauce, cucumber, and leeks. Course 2 arrives with a duck meat stir fry and iceberg lettuce wraps.  Everything was tasty, and its definately some of the better Beijing roasted duck ive had in the GTA. The skin was exceptionally crispy, and my fave part!"}
{"text":"Only come for the peking duck, because the rest is passable.  Don't expect good service, the place is old and reeks.  If you want high quality peking duck, go across the street at the Brilliant Restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Peking Duck I've ever had in my life, and I've tried it at many places. The duck was DRY. Bone dry. It was severely over cooked. Don't waste your money here and go elsewhere. For $49 (3 course) it is NOT worth it. We also ordered the mixed seafood birds nest. The \"nest\" is usually the best part. A nice crunchy shell, something very nostalgic to my childhood. But this shell has probably been there since the day they opened. It was beyond STALE. The service was slow. There weren't many customers but the dishes took a long time to arrive. A LONG time. It's like they have 1 chef working in the back. Eat here at your own risk. For a Friday night it was fairly EMPTY."}
{"text":"Get the duck! for $40 the duck courses easily can feed 2-4 people. I find it hard to envision a lot of improvements on the Peking duck they serve here. Perfectly crisp, not a lot of fat, good portions, and good price. The crispy beef was good and everything else was alright. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews about this place, I was not really impressed.  Came here with my family after our vacation for dinner. I heard good reviews about this place and we were all starving, so we figured that we had nothing to lose coming here- food tastes good when you're hungry!  We were wrong. The food here was far from spectacular. It wasn't horrible, but I wish we had chosen to eat elsewhere.  Pros: Generous portions, low price. Cons: Food was not fresh (lots of canned food with preservatives that could clearly be tasted). Szechuan dishes were not spicy.   We ordered: Crab meat with corn soup: Did not taste fresh (crab meat smelled funny) and the soup was under-seasoned. Corn was not fresh or sweet tasting. I usually love this soup... but not here. Spiced chicken in Garlic Peanut sauce: I enjoyed the garlic peanut sauce. It had a hint of garlic and just enough sweetness, and it went well with the chicken and peanuts. However, this dish, despite the chili symbol beside it, was NOT spicy at all- it was more sweet than spicy. Also, the vegetables in this dish did not taste fresh- again,  it was definitely canned, and that preserved taste was noticeable. The chicken had been deep fried, making it greasy and obviously, unhealthy. It didn't taste bad though. We ate the chicken and left a pile of veggies.  Szechuan Shredded beef: Once again, not spicy at all... It was heavy on the hoisin sauce, so it was sweet,  But it was ok. Pork fried rice: I usually don't like fried rice from restaurants. But this actually tasted pretty good, and I liked how there was lettuce in the fried rice... and how it wasn't loaded with huge pieces of pork, peas, and shrimp. Fried rice cake with assorted meat: The assorted meat accompanied by canned veggies was drowned in a flavourful sauce. We enjoyed it. However, the rice cake was not so good- not light and crispy like it should be and it liked to stick to our teeth.  The restaurant is also famous for it's Peking duck, which we did not try. Perhaps we'll have better luck with that. Maybe next time... we'll come just for that. Because everything else didn't leave us impressed."}
{"text":"YUMMM. Our go-to Peking duck place that doesn't have that much of a wait generally. Their crispy sichuan beef is my absolute favorite. So flavourful and you can't find it in any other restaurant. Their Peking duck is pretty good. The skin is always crispy but there are times when the meat itself is dry. Service is usually good, especially for a Chinese restaurant. Regardless this place is a gem and not too packed which is great."}
{"text":"Really, surprisingly good.   This looks like a run-of-the-mill chinese restaurant with the added bonus of serving Peking duck. I didn't have much expectations ordering from here, except to kill my craving of the day for greasy chinese food.  I've already come here on 3 occasions, and have not been disappointed yet.   The lunch specials are great; at $8.95 a pop, the portions are pretty full-sized and come with a freshly fried spring roll and hot and sour soup, both which are pretty tasty by themselves.  I've also had the 3-course Peking duck package, which for around $40 something dollars, was a definite winner. All 3 duck dishes were delicious, and really for the price, I wasn't expecting quality.  Really great value and quality overall."}
{"text":"Holy chow, I left downtown.  Doesn't happen often, nor is it rare, it's more like occasional.  I make that trek for priority one friends only.    On Saturday, I went up to spend the day with my favourite uptown family.  It was pre-decided that we would do peking duck night.  I obviously left restaurant choice to them, for a couple of reasons.  The first is because they are Taiwanese, and the second is because I trust them.  There's also the added buffer that the lady of the family feels the same way about Chinatown as I do, that is to say, we approach it with EXTREME caution, although in her case, she wouldn't approach at all.    They took me to Chung King behind Pacific Mall in Market Village.  It's fairly unnoticeable, but for the line of people waiting.  We had reservations obviously, because the family knows to how to plan.  I love planners.  It seems this is the place to go for authentic Mandarin and Szechuan food, and more importantly, this is the place to get roasted duck.  As we sat at our table, I noted that server after server walked out with a duck, took it to a table where they were happily dismissed with a happy nod, wave or word.  He or she then promptly disappeared only to return with same duck, chopped up.  With each duck I saw, the more room I made in my stomach.  This was the first time I had peking duck where they bring the crispy little quacker out for me to see before I eat.   We also ordered the Szechuan Beef - thin strip of crispy chewy beef with a kick - and the Birds Nest. Now I thought the latter was greasy seafood and broccoli in a deep fried chowmein bowl.  I would be wrong.  See, I come from a lone line of people who don't particularly like Chinese food (crazy right).  So if and when we ate it, it was usually mainstream and mainstream birds nest is just that.  My friend gasped when I told her and she simply said, \"that would be wrong\".    It is actually a crispy bowl made out of deep fried potato shreds.  Huh?  The seafood and vegetable medley inside is garlicky, not greasy, and said medley includes bamboo, water chestnuts, carrots, etc.  Right sounds much more delicious now doesn't it.  It was a proper birds nest, and proper tastes good.   We also had duck two ways (there is a third way - soup - but we decided to skip it).  The first option is the most common way to have peking duck.  The skin and slivers of meat are cut up and served with crêpes, hoisin, cucumbers, and scallions.  The second is also a wrap.  The rest of the meat from the ducks is diced and fried and served with lettuce cups.  Our duck was perfect - crispy, silky, meaty, fatty but not oily.   It's about $40 for duck two-ways.  I'm pretty sure I could have eaten both ways by myself.  Shoulda, coulda, woulda..."}
{"text":"So I've been going to this place for 12 years now and it's always been so consistently great! My family and I love it here! The lunch special is great value for money as well. Unfortunately my sister was there a couple weeks ago and found a hair in her food..they did absolutely nothing, barely even apologized, other then that I only have good things to say. Crispy beef, garlic green beans, garlic peanut chicken, hot and sour soup and the mushoo pork are must trys!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY  The good: We enjoyed the duck 3 ways. The skin dish was delicious and well cooked, as was the duck soup. The other dish (minced duck  & veggies in lettuce wraps) was my least favorite of the 3, but still nice   The average: -scallop and veggies was decent, and came with a fair amount of scallops. I think it was a few dollars overpriced though at $17 -noodle dish was also okay  The bad: -cash only -Lamb skewers: 8 for $16. They were really small with minimal meat. The meat was also very dry and not tasty. Definitely a rip off. Avoid  So in summary, the only good dish was the duck. Prices were higher than other Chinese restaurants. I won't be back, unless I was to get the duck ONLY for takeout"}
{"text":"We came back to give this resto a chance after a bad experience on their soft opening at the new location. Service was much better. I checked in via yelp and got complimentary spring rolls. All the dishes we got were yummy...duck 2 ways, crispy ginger beef, fried rice deserves a thumbs up. The shrimp w cashews was so so, predictable and one note. So we will come back as we were all satisfied!"}
{"text":"Came here for a special birthday celebration with the family. It wasn't that busy on a Thursday night so service was fast and efficient. We ordered the Peking duck (3ways), sweet and sour fish, seafood birds nest, and crispy beef.  Peking duck 1. With slices of duck and skin wraps This was delicious. The duck didn't taste too oily and contrary to other reviews there were enough wraps given.   2.Duck with lettuce wraps This was amazing.  I love how they stir fried the duck meat with veggies and have you wrap it in lettuce.  It was a little oily but the lettuce helps make it healthy, right?? 3.Duck soup I would give this a pass next time.  The soup was just okay and they chopped up the remaining duck and tossed it in some soup. It's not like the bones have been simmering in the stock for hours or anything.  Sweet and sour fish This was very, very good.  They deep fried a whole fish and tossed it in the sweet and sour sauce.  It was a little pricey though but definitely get it if you like fish.  Seafood Birds Nest This was really good too, although my only complaint is the nest could be a little bigger for the price you are paying and also more pieces of seafood would be nice.    Crispy Beef The only reason I ordered this dish is from previous glowing yelp reviews.  This dish did not impress me at all.  The crispy beef was mostly just batter and the whole thing was just too oily.  I would definitely give this a pass.  All in all, I really enjoyed my meal at Chung King.  The peking duck is a must and you should order it right when you sit down as it takes a while to prepare.  The restaurant is a bit on the expensive side but great for a special occasion.  I will be back."}
{"text":"One of my faves for peking duck! Having been to the original location near Market Village multiple times, I can testify their new location in Thornhill has consistent quality! Their Peking duck comes in a fair size for the price. The Peking duck course meal has a soup, Peking duck andWe're always impressed with the flavour and texture of the prepared duck, as well as the preparation of the wraps that go with them. As well, the filling that pairs with the lettuce wraps is well seasoned and flavourful. One of my favourite parts of the set meal is the soup, which is nice and peppery, with lots of meat. Beyond Peking duck, this place makes a great Sichuan beef dish; crispy and not overly fried, with just the right amount of spice. Would recommend this establishment for a nice northern Chinese dinner, with quality good and great for large groups."}
{"text":"I don't know how this restaurant received such high ratings because one look at the cleanliness of the restaurant and dishes made me loose my appetite. The Peking duck was average and the bill was high, thank god it was not my money."}
{"text":"Came here with another couple and ordered the 2 course Peking duck, Szechuan shredded beef (as some refer to it as crispy beef) and bamboo shoots with mushrooms (ordered this by accident). The Peking duck was super crispy and not as fatty as all other places I've been to which I love since I tend to peel off all the fat and the slices with meat actually had thick pieces of meat. The second course with the lettuce wraps were pretty good, but a little too salty for my liking. Now the szechuan shredded beef, omg delicious! It was crispy, sweet, tangy with a little bit of spice. I would have ordered another one to myself if I had more room for it. The bamboo shoots were not what we intended to order. When I read it it processed as pea shoots as we wanted greens and when it came out I almost even sent it back until I was realized crap! I ordered bamboo shoots not pea shoots! Didn't like this dish much. The bamboo was clearly from a can and there was too much sauce. Other than that everything was great. The service was super friendly and they always came around filling our water."}
{"text":"Not sure what other helpers is talking about this place. But for me this place is totally not authentic. Came with family wanted to give it a try at this new place here.  Ordered 4 dishes, shanghai noodles, ma po tofu a soup and xiao long bao.  Shanghai noodles was ok but could use a little more flavor in it.  Soup was normal nothing special cause is probably just boiled water with vege and meat.  Ma po tofu also could use a little more of spice and flavor.  The dim sum xiao long bao, skin is too thick and not enough soup base inside the dim sum. Normally eating this have to bite of the top slowly so the soup won't pour out and hot if you put the whole thing in your mouth. But this one you could put the whole in your mouth cause not hot enough and not enough soup base."}
{"text":"My friends and I recently came here especially for the Peking duck, served two ways. One with the traditional wrap and secondly with the lettuce wraps. Both equally delicious! As accompaniments, we also ordered the Shanghai noodle with pork, lobster, stir fried spicy beef, and seafood in fried taros nest. Everything tasted delicious and nothing was overly spicy. Would definitely be back for duck."}
{"text":"We took my in-laws to this restaurant for lunch today.  We have ordered mostly the traditional Chinese dishes such as steamed pork dumplings, pork pot stickers, Shanghainese stir-fry noodles, Green Onion Pan Cakes etc.  Although the taste was decent, I am more concerned with the service as they have no idea of what was served and was still missing.  Moreover, they have a tendency not to write the order down mean while there were only 5 tables at the time.  May I also mind you that the portions are quite small too compared to other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"This just opened up a couple weeks ago. Came for lunch. The dim sum and noodles are solid and staff is friendly. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I think this may be the only restaurant in Toronto that serves authentic Peking Ducks. Other places serve BBQ pretending to be a Peking Duck. Overall, a good place to go for a change in cuisine."}
{"text":"This is my favorite peking duck restaurant in the GTA! I typically order the the two course option.   I've tried other dishes on their menu, but I've learned that it is best to just stick with the peking duck.   Make sure to bring cash because it is CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Been twice now since they moved to nicer, cleaner location. Lunch specials are great, everything hot made to order.  I had the orange beef which was spicy and delicious. Came back and did the duck which was awesome and the salt and pepper squid which was probably the best I've had outside of Boston. I'm probably going tomorrow, we'll see, maybe just get da wife to pick up for dinner.. mmmmm.."}
{"text":"I used to love this place for their lunch specials and certain spicy dishes.. Orange beef, eggplant with garlic sauce etc.. Every time I would go here though I would see duck after duck come out of the kitchen. So we finally came for dinner one night and got the 2 course duck... The f**kers gave half our duck to someone else!!! I know how big a duck is and they definitely didn't give us our full bird."}
{"text":"Was my go to spot for many years when it was in Market Village. The food at the new location is not the same and I suspect new ownership and new chefs. Service is slow, perhaps due to staffing issues. Tough to provide a dinner service for 50+ people with only 3 waiters. The Peking Duck and the skins were served to us cold."}
{"text":"Everything was too salty and too much garlic. I got a bad headache after eating here. I wonder if there was MSG in some of the food. Probably. Had the duck. It was not very good, and I've had much better duck before (not in GTA, other cities). Service was slow. Ambiance - not at all fancy: white-boards with stuff written on it in sloppy marker, a pile of boxes (were those diapers? wet pads?) and things in plain sight in the dining room. I don't know if the restaurant was clean. I say this because later on in the night, I had severe - now I mean SEVERE - GI upset. I hadn't eaten anything else but this meal that day. Either I'm allergic to their additives, or something was off. Not going back. No. In fact, I feel queasy just thinking about this meal..."}
{"text":"Fortune Cookie!  I finally figured out what was bothering me about the dining experience at Chung King Garden.  Last time I had Fortune Cookie at a Chinese restaurant in the Markham area was....... Never?   2-course Peking Duck.  While the French fatten up Ducks for their Liver, the Chinese fatten up Ducks for their SKIN.  The server came out carrying a plate with the WHOLE Peking Duck then took it back inside.  We got JIPPED!  While the Duck looked steriod-style plump it was anti-climatic as one of the highlights of a Peking Duck is the Chef's presentation.  It's the same as a Teppanyaki Chef doing their Onion Volcano presentation.   3.5  *Star*  My Foreign Friends were sitting table side and it would have been completely awesome to see her shock as the Chef grabs the Duck by the Neck and skinned the Peking Duck piece-by-piece in front of her.   :D   Alas no table-side presentation as the plate of Peking Duck comes out from the Kitchen to the table directly.  Duck Skin & Pancake Wrap  -  Crispy Skin.  Low-Fat Duck Meat(Meh).  That's why you eat the Duck Meat with Hoisin Sauce/Scallions inside the Pancake Wrap rather than on its own.  Minced Duck & Lettuce Wrap  -  Excellent savoury flavoured Minced Duck Meat mixture balanced out with the refreshing Lettuce Wrap.  Water Chestnut and Deep-fried Rice Noodle gave some contrasting texture to the soft Minced Meat.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Sizzling Plate Beef  -  Extreme Sizzling Plate that explodes sauces within a 15 cm radius.  The dish had flavour but the Beef seemed overly tender for some reason.  Nonetheless I'll eat it.  Seafood in Taros Nest  -  Scallop, Shrimp, Squid and Mixed Vegetables sit inside the Nest made of Taro.  As good as the others I've had in the past."}
{"text":"We've been to Chung King at Yonge and Clark twice in the past few weeks. It's now our go-to restaurant for American-style Sichuan food, even though we live in the east end of downtown Toronto. It's well worth the drive. The crispy Szechuan Shredded Beef is amazing, as is the Preserved Orange Shrimp, Moo Shu Pork, Garlic Peanut Chicken, and Spicy Green Beans. Next time we'll order the 2-course Peking duck. The next table over had it and it looked fabulous. We're looking forward to sampling more of the dishes on the menu.  I'm having trouble figuring out how previous posters have had such negative impressions of Chung King. If I'd listened to them I would have missed out on a really great restaurant. Service both times we were there was friendly and efficient and all of the dishes came out in a very timely manner. I have never posted on yelp before but felt this establishment should receive the positive recognition it deserves."}
{"text":"The service and food here was amazing compared to other chinese restaurants.  This is the first chinese restaurant that was willing to make a new soup for my brother who is allergic to tofu. We didn't even ask them to do it, they simply did it without asking which is super nice of them.   Highly recommend the fried fish with the sweet and sour sauce."}
{"text":"I heard from friends that Chung King Garden is known for its duck dishes (all of which I've never tried), but I'm writing this review for my favorite dish and it's not explicitly listed in the menu: the crispy beef.  The quality of the crisp and melding of flavor of this dish are just superb and I order it every time-- I've never been disappointed.  The interiors is standard family Chinese restaurant and nothing really fancy, and is great for groups of 6 or more. Service is friendly and prompt, which adds to the dining experience nicely.  if you're done with the duck, try the crispy beef, arguably the best in the GTA."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to my family during our trip to Toronto and were told they are known for the Peking Duck.  Beijing Kao Yaaaa.    We ordered the 3-course Peking duck for abt $36 CAD....and were shockingly thrilled at all the food that this included!!!!  1st course:  Duck skin + wraps for your typical peking duck wraps.  Scallions/cucumbers.  Wraps were a bit dry.  its the thin ones, not the man tao textured ones.  the shrimp chips under the duck skin were obviously fried in old oil, tasted like...chinese kitchen pot.  2nd course:  Duck meat minced up with water chestnuts, carrots, etc for LETTUCE WRAPS!!!!!  a-w-e-s-o-m-e.  except that extra lettuce leaves are 4 for $1.  rip off.  next time i'll carry in a head of lettuce from the grocery store next door.    3rd course: Duck bone soup with clear vermacelli, bok choy/napa and soft tofu.  delicious even on a hot summer day.  i LOVE good soup.    All in all - great food good value good service.  If we go back to Toronto, we will go back to Chung King for duck."}
{"text":"Peking Duck is the best. For a cheaper price, you can try the Mu Xu Rou (just ask the waiter), it's served with shells. Good meal!"}
{"text":"Best Peking duck! The pancakes are thin and warm and slightly yeasty. The skin was crispy and fragrant. The sauce was either homemade or home modified, a little thinner than most (that's a good thing). We ordered it two ways: the second course was minced with vegetables served with lettuce cups. One whole duck easily serves 4 people."}
{"text":"Best Szechuan beef in town. Orange chicken and Peking duck are great too. Have tried their seafood like crabs and lobsters and they taste so much better than Red Lobster or Saigon Star's curry crabs.   Accepts reservations and courteous staff.   Drop by ATM first. They only accept cash."}
{"text":"Yup LEGIT Peking duck. I repeat. LE-GIT. I had apprehension about writing this place up else I lose my spot to ease my Peking duck cravings but I know they provide service \"Asian style\" so that will keep some peeps away. The Asian folks in the know come here. Solid lineup of dishes all centered on the roasted duck. In the land of Asian cuisine, this place is tops for the duck."}
{"text":"As always I'm reviewing a particular item, I don't know the other dishes but the duck was definitely the best duck I've had in the GTA.   Super crispy skin, mmm crispy skin... And amazing roast flavour. The lettuce wrap course was delicious too!  We had the 2 course duck because my friend who brought us said \"I know it's just $5 more but it's not worth it for the soup\". Not being a fan of soups anyway, I took her at her word.   We also ordered the dry sautéed string beans which were ok but not as amazing as the duck. My friend also swears by their Szechuan beef but we couldn't fit it in.  I'd say 3-4 people for duck w a vegetable dish or a rice is the perfect portions.   It's a bit of a trip for me but I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I have always been on the search for a restaurant that serves the best Peking Duck. Chung King Garden does just that. Located along the strip of restaurants in Market Village, this small restaurant can easily go unnoticed. But it doesn't need a flashy sign in front for people to know because it has been so consistent with what they do, that people keep coming back. And it gets PACKED, so be sure to make reservations prior to coming here over the weekends.   The Peking Duck prepared and served here is fantastic. Too many times Peking Duck is prepared too oily, too much fat, or too dry. But at Chung King, there is a delicate balance of a crispy outer skin, moist tender duck meat, with a thin layer of fat in between. The steamed wraps that come with the meal is prepared hot and thin, without being too doughy or flour-y. Carefully wrapping the roasted duck, onion strips, cucumbers, and hoi sin sauce together, each bite was bursting of flavour of the succulent meat and the sweetness of the sauce. Goes without saying, everyone was fighting for that last wrap.   As part of the 2 course Peking Duck meal, we ordered the Minced Duck and Lettuce Wrap. The minced duck was very flavourful and with the lettuce wrap leaves a refreshing texture to all that meat.   Note: CASH only."}
{"text":"Yelp's tagline is correct, 4 stars, \"Yay! I'm a fan\".  Four of us came here at 6pm on a Thursday night and we were the first ones in the restaurant, but don't let that be a deterrent for coming early because the restaurant got crowded quick. They seemed under-staffed as we had a hard time getting any attention to order food or pay our bill.  We got the following dishes to share: - shredded beef: By far, the star of the show and probably the most unhealthiest dish, but if we put health on the sidelines for minute. The texture of the beef was crispy from getting fried and battered, and the spice was level was spot on such that the spice built on with every bite you take. - seafood bird's nest: A more muted dish, but the combination of the fried bird nest, with the different types of seafood and the taro root which lined the bottom of the dish was delicious. - Chinese broccoli: This was a custom request, where we asked for a really simple vegetable dish and our waitress was nice enough to let us have this custom order of Chinese broccoli stir fried with garlic. It was a meh dish though. - Pork fried rice: Likewise, a meh dish but still enjoyable to eat.  Give this place a chance if you want to make your way through potentially unattentive staff. Food is debatably worth it."}
{"text":"I came here for their pecking duck. It was a disappointment. The waitress first showed us the full duck that was going to be sliced up for us. I got excited because it looked big. When she came out, it seemed like there's only a couple of pieces. It's not worth the $40. Crispy beef was okay. We ordered noodles too and it wasn't good. Will not return."}
{"text":"I didn't try the famous peking duck (we ordered takeout and that's not really a takeout dish) so please don't base my star-rating on their quacker. Everyone seems to agree it's fantastic.  This review is for the crispy beef, orange chicken and hot-and-sour soup. I was underwhelmed by the meal. The beef was okay I guess, but the chicken wasn't my favourite and  the soup wasn't very tasty at all. Sorry! Not a fan."}
{"text":"Pretty good tasting Peking Duck. And I mean good value for the 2 course pecking duck. They give a lot of minced duck with lettuce wrap. All for about $38. Add a few other dishes and you got enough to eat for a party of 4-5 people. They have large tables for larger gatherings too. The staff is great and seem as humble as the decor in the restaurant. They definitely rely on word of mouth as this place gets popular on weekends. However, Chung King isn't so packed on a weekday night, so why not visit after work around 6pm. You'll definitely enjoy the service and pace with your friends and family."}
{"text":"I started a thread on YELP Toronto, asked for advice, and this is one of the places I got very disappointed with.....  We walk in at about 1130am, thinking we are going to have a great lunch, the lady with the glasses completely ignores us, we sit down on one of the tables....she finally comes by after 15 min., drops the menus off and I immediately ordered the peking duck, knowing that it is gonna take some time.....  Then she comes back, we order all types of noodles, wait another 15 min. for noodles to come.....all tasted terrible, and when I say terrible, no flavor, lacking texture, I don't have words for this meal.....  So after an hour, really after an hour, we tell them to forget about our peking duck, cause it hasn't arrived yet, we are getting close to 1pm now, so we paid the bill and left...."}
{"text":"favourite resto! have been coming here for over 10 years. MUST HAVES: 1)Peking Duck. The best in the city. We usually get the 2 course, have never tried the 3 course (third course is a soup i think). 2) Szechuan Shredded Beef. Also, imo, the best in the city. 3) ginger and green onion lobster. These three items are ordered every time we come, and in addition we also order the chicken and corn soup to start, and sometimes we get the spicy wonton as another appetizer. the lunch specials are also excellent for under $10 you get a soup, freshly fried spring roll, and  a choice of over a dozen dishes, i always get the szechuan shredded beef. Can get really busy on the weekends, i dont recommend a saturday night, as the kitchen staff just get overwhelmed. But any other night, this place is a must for peking duck."}
{"text":"An executive chef friend of mine, with a lot of travel experience in the Far East and around the world, recommended Chung King Garden a few years ago for their specialty, Peking Duck. After having eaten this dish at many different places over many years, I have to agree that this might be the best I've had. I've been coming here for the duck for a few years now.  These guys do it properly. They pump air into the duck for maximum crispiness of the skin and they present it at the table before slicing. Nice touch. It's served with the traditional steamed pancakes for wrapping, sliced cucumbers and green onions, and a generous amount of hoisin sauce. That's just the first course.   The second course includes the rest of the duck meat, minced and fried up with carrots, celery, and onions. It's also served with lettuce for wrapping. A third course is available as a soup, using the bones from the duck. We decided not to go that route.  Another popular dish that we just had to order is the Szechuan Shredded Beef, crispy and sweet, with some citrus notes. A lamb stew with tofu sticks (foo jook) and sauteed snow peas tips with garlic was more than enough food for five of us. A complimentary sweet red bean soup was served for dessert.  Overall, the food is very good but the Peking (Bejing) duck is what everybody comes here for. The two-course option is around $40 and the soup option is about $5 more. I've ordered Peking duck at other restaurants and they've used a regular BBQ duck (the kind you often see hanging in the window at Chinese BBQ shops). Don't be fooled. It's not the same."}
{"text":"Wicked gangsta place for peking duck. I love peking duck and have tried many places in the Markham area. This place WAS the best bang for your buck at around $32 for 2 course. The price has now been raised to about $38 for 2 course.........still worth it in my opinion, just wish I had invested in more duck when it was $32 haha. I have noticed better service towards chinese speaking customers, being chinese I have only had great service and always end with chinese dessert rather then fortune cookies. My suggestion is bring a chinese friend who can speak chinese. This place is cash only. If anyone knows of a better place in the Markham area for duck and for a decent price, I would love to hear about it!"}
{"text":"Just like when it was in Market Village, Chung King makes authentic Peking duck.  It has relatively reasonably priced Peking duck dinner combos.  The food quality during our visit was on par with when Chung King was at its previous location.  Considering it was Christmas Eve, and the kitchen worked non stop, I would call it an impressive feat.  The service was insufficient, however.  The lady washroom ran out of toilet paper at 7pm.  I told a waitress about it, but it wasn't remedied until the dinner rush was over."}
{"text":"Peking Duck should be your number one reason to patronize Chung King.  I have been to Chung King many times. Every time we ordered the Peking Duck.  I don't even bother to review the other dishes, cause the quality of everything that is not Peking Duck fluctuates from authentic Chinese food level to Americanized Chinese food level, from time to time.  Sometimes there is a reasonable amount of MSG, sometimes there is a lot.  The Peking Duck, though, is consistent.  It is also authentic.  Is it the best in Toronto?  Not in my personal opinion.  Yet the overall pricing, free garnishments, combo, etc., offers a good valued, authentic Peking Duck meal.  Cash only. Reservation recommended for weekends."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been to this place and although the food is good, the customer service is horrible.   Today's events have convinced me never to come here again. We waited for an hour for our order of peking duck, crispy beef and fried rice. We watched others who came and order after us, get their dishes (duck and crispy beef!), eat their dishes, while we sit there waiting for our order and getting hungrier by the second. We asked about our order and they just say it's coming, while we wait some more...  Then, we get accosted after we paid our bill. One of the waiter, an older lady, slams down the bill and the money for the tip and say loudly, \"There's no tip included!\" Suddenly, she can speak english and understand us, whereas earlier she couldn't at all when we needed food! We definitely left a tip for the horrible service, but apparently, that was not enough! I gave her more money for the tip, but now I realized I shouldn't have, as it was really horrible service and she acted as if the tip should be based on their demand and not the customer's satisfaction. I will never go the place again, nor will I recommend it to any of my friends.  By the way, the Peking Duck that they show to customers who ordered it...that is not the peking duck served! They show the same one over and over again, sometimes in different position. We observed this while we watched duck after duck pass our table. We also saw the male waiter, before he brought it out, burning some lighted incense or something around the duck, to make it seem like it's fresh and hot. And it's true what one of the review says, you don't get the whole peking duck... this place is a rip-off!"}
{"text":"Take my word, and all those of the Yelpers here: when it comes to Peking Duck, this place can't be beat! The duck skin is perfectly crisp, moist and delicious, hands down the BEST Peking duck I've had in Toronto - that HAS to be saying something.  The restaurant itself is fairly small, so it's probably a good thing it wasn't especially busy (although I went on a Thursday evening), but each and every table that was occupied had a serving of duck, front and centre. The biggest surprise for me (and I say this based on many experiences at various Chinese restaurants across the city) was the good service! Our waitress spoke great English (which helps my mom greatly!), made sure our teapot was constantly filled with hot water and our water glasses were not empty, and she was even a little bit funny! Sure, the overall service wasn't the best I've ever had, but SO much improved over other Chinese restaurants (i.e. 90% of ANY bubble tea house, dim sum restaurant, etc.) We also ordered the orange beef, which I would call mediocre at best, but my dad really enjoyed. It wasn't overly spicy, which was a nice surprise - just spicy enough - but, for me, was just a little TOO saucy for my liking. I'm so glad to have found a new place to satisfy my Peking Duck cravings (yes folks, Peking duck cravings exist) & will definitely be directing anyone who asks for it this way."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Ordered: Peking duck-2 courses; $42. Szechuan shredded beef; $15. Yang Chow Fried rice; $12  The Peking duck came after 1 hour wait. There were 2 tables that ordered Peking ducks as well. Skin was crispy, duck meat was hard (no fat at all). Beef was not crispy but good. Fried rice was dry and tasted like cheap rice.  Service was alright. Wait for food was not worth it. The chef needs more training in making the Peking duck.  This restaurant also serves Canadianized-Chinese food.  The restaurant was not very busy on a Saturday night.  I would be suspicious of some of the yelp reviews; overall, the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Saturday night at around 7:00pm. Huge line up and had to wait about 20 minutes.   Hands down the best peking duck you will find.   Ordered peking duck cooked 2 ways. Before slicing the duck they bring out the whole roasted duck for you to inspect. Wasn't expecting that. I thought this was only done with lobsters and crabs and in high end steak restaurants. The whole roasted duck looked amazing. Wish I got a picture of it.   $38 and change for the roast duck cooked 2 ways. The duck skin was super thin, light and crispy and the duck meat itself was very lean with no fat. Underneath the duck skin slices were Chinese shrimp chips (ha pean). They always taste better at restaurants when they cook the chips fresh. Eating the duck with the wrap was really good but when eating just the duck skin alone you can really taste the quality. The second duck dish was minced duck meat with lettuce wrap. The meat was really tender and moist and it almost looked like pulled duck meat like they have pulled pork at BBQ's.    We also got some other dishes: sweet and sour pork - very yummy with light crispy batter  seafood bird nest - only okay sliced beef and sizzling plate - wouldn't order this again  Just like Jennifer k mentioned already, if I were ever to come back I would stick with the roast duck.  For dessert you get sweet red bean soup included."}
{"text":"I loved their food! I came here for special family dinner on a Sunday evening. We had 10 people and they were able to accommodate us day of. Their group set menu were not too pricey compared to others but their food tasted good and was a good value I thought. I really liked their peking duck. The standout was the crispy skin. I don't think I've had skin that was so tasty, perfectly crispy but not dry in a long time. The food came out promptly and service was pretty good"}
{"text":"The Peking duck I had this time was really dry and hard...it didn't taste like it was fresh at all, it seemed like it's been sitting around all day. The skin for the first wraps was like just skin, dry and hard and the meat that was there was really overcooked. The other food was decent but the duck was really bad this time.  The service was bad as always but it seems like it got a lot worse than I remembered...It wasn't just one server but all of them, they gave us attitude everytime we asked for something and when we told them the duck was bad, they pretended like they couldn't understand cantonese so we had to tell them in mandarin when clearly she spoke cantonese to another server afterwards.  Definitely not recommended for duck anymore and will never go back."}
{"text":"The pecking duck here is amazing. The portions are generous, the skin is crispy and the pancakes are soft and chewy. The waiter and waitresses are always friendly. :)  (The crispy beef is yummy too but I always end up ordering the pecking duck unless I come with three or more people.)"}
{"text":"You must come to try the Peking Duck if that is what you were asking yourself. It is absolutely delicious and can easily feed 2 people. The two course route is my recommendation, with the first course being the extremely crispy duck skin and meat served with soft pancake, hoisin sauce, cucumber, and green onion. The second course is my personal favourite. It uses the rest of the duck meat, minced and fried with an assortment of veggies, served with fresh cold and crunchy lettuce.   Service was excellent, and the cost is reasonable at 39.99 for the two course I had just described."}
{"text":"We came here to try out the Peking Duck.  It was just meh.  Nothing special.  The skin was not especially crispy.  The service was pretty bad.  They kept on turning people away because they had reservations for later that evening but the tables sat empty for the entire time we were there.  I don't think it was worth going all the way to Markham for it."}
{"text":"We ordered the Peking Duck 2 course meal.  They said it would take 25 minutes to cook the duck.  Then the waitress brought a whole, large piping hot duck to our table and said it was our duck and would be cut.  Then the waitress took the hot duck back to the kitchen.  We have had Peking Duck in many restaurants over the decades.  We know what to expect.    When the first plate of cut duck skin and meat arrived it was a large plate of shrimp chips with a small, single, thin layer of duck skin on top and a few pieces of duck meat.  The skin and meat were very cold - as if they had just been taken out of a refrigerator.  When we complained about the temperature, we were informed that the door to the kitchen is open to the outside so the kitchen is as cold as the outdoors. They repeated several times that our plate was the hot duck they had just shown us.  I noticed that the other (non-Peking duck) dishes served to the other tables were all hot.  So it appeared that our dish was cut near the open door, but all the other dishes must have been prepared in a warmer portion of the kitchen.    I estimate that we had somewhat less than a full duck worth of skin, but I'm estimating less than 20% of a full duck of meat.  I asked why they didn't cut the hot duck in front of us, as is done is most other restaurants.  We were told that they are too busy in the kitchen.  The restaurant was much, much less than half full - about 5 tables of customers including us.    If you want to pay for a full duck and receive a small, refrigerated portion of a duck, I certainly suggest you go to this restaurant.  If you want a complete, hot, fresh Peking duck, I suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've  been here several times. Food is very authentic. My husband was the only non Asian person there hehe. Food is mandarin and Szechuan style. They only have soda by the can. They have a lot of dishes. We got a little bit of everything. Service was good."}
{"text":"First time at the new location. Waiter sees us at the door and proceeds to walk past us 4 times but did not seat us. He knew we were there. How do i know? He looked straight at us. We finally flagged another server down and eventually got a table.  Update: 10 minutes seated and still no menu. I'd love to review their food but i don't think they want our business.   Update: 15 minutes and still nothing. We ate walking out."}
{"text":"Best Peking duck I've had outside Beijing! Get the three part duck dinner, it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I liked the new location, and I think that the food is better as well. We went during lunch time and there were lots of parking spaces. The servers  were friendly and I was happy with their services. They also now accept credit cards unlike old management. We ordered Peking duck, veggies, sautéed soft noodles and stewed pork loin with Chinese buns. Don't Mind coming back again to try their other dishes.u"}
{"text":"Though the chung king that used to be in torontos china town was a 10 star this chung king is a very close second... not much to look at and only accept cash but the food is great.  The quality is always good.  English speaking.  Duck is fantastic!  Szechwan beef and spicy beans have had us coming back for years!  We drive from Etobicoke to Pacific mall!"}
{"text":"Crispy Peking duck finally so much closer than Markham. This place is the same as the old one with more space and a few more tables. Menus and prices are the same. It's already pretty busy during dinner hours, but basically empty during close. They still seated a group of 6 half an hour before close.   Came here as a group of 4. The tables for four is definitely not enough table space for the three-course Peking duck. Peking duck is made to order, so expect it to take some time. Skin is super crispy and meat itself is ok. ~$50 for the set."}
{"text":"The first time I ever ate here was before I went to a concert at the amphitheater with a guy named Mike over 7 years ago.  This is not close to the amphitheater (at all - like 30km away), but we were shopping for DVDs at Pacific Mall beforehand and he had eaten here before.   Mike and I aren't friends anymore; he actually became my roommate some time later and one day I got out of the shower and his mom was moving his stuff out without him telling me he was moving.  Anyways, the point of this story is that I will always have at least one good memory of Mike because of introducing me to Chung King.  The worst memory I will ever have of Mike is the time he messed up the date of the Esthero concert from the Wikkid Little Girls tour and we missed it EVEN THOUGH WE HAD TICKETS because he is deficient with calendars.  Over the years I have periodically gone to Pacific Mall to buy shredded pork jerky from Ding Dong foods and always stopped for lunch or dinner at Chung King.  Even when I lived in Niagara Falls, I made special trips to eat food here.  Today I went for lunch, and although the woman gave me the dinner menu, she would only let me order off the lunch menu (even though everyone else had dinner menu items) and I truly didn't even care that she was so rude, because the food was amazing (as always).  There are a few round tables here for groups with lazy-susans built in for spinning dishes around to serve, they always bring me a fork even though I don't ask for one and don't need one, they only take cash, no credit cards, no debit cards... only cash.  And there is a pot of green tea brought to the table when you sit down automatically.    The service is not usually very good, the lack of credit and debit card payments is kind of a downer and you should get in your car and drive to Markham immediately to try this food.  It will knock your socks off.  My favorite things:  - szechwan beef (sometimes she calls it crispy garlic beef) - orange chicken (medium spicy) - veggie spring rolls  Stay away from: - the vegetable medley (I took a vegetarian there once... it did not work out)  Parking here can be horrible, they only take cash and again I promise you it is worth it."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time for Peking duck based on Yelp reviews. It easily met expectations, as good as I've had including in Beijing, served with ample crepes and toppings. The lettuce wrap follow-up was also excellent.   Since we were just 2 there wasn't tummy capacity to order more, but green onion pancakes and fried dumplings as starters were delicious. We will gladly go back, ideally with others so we can try more of the appealing menu. (Cash or debit only, no credit cards.)"}
{"text":"before coming in my mom kept going on about how they have changed owners and she was worried about the food might not be as good anymore. i then prepared myself for this bias and figured if i think the food is bad, it might just be my mom. but the food was objectively bad. so bad that the shrimp chips were old and stale and the duck soup just tasted like water. they charged extra for the tortilla to eat the duck with. we ordered the duck three way and everything was so bland and no one was full, but we ordered a couple of side dishes and it tasted just as bad. avoid."}
{"text":"Been back for a few more times to Chung King for Peking Duck and other dishes.  Duck is still good but seriously the other dishes are really meh..  Every time I have out of town guests, I ended up eating here. But from now on, I will just going to order the duck two way..and then go some where else for a 2nd meal!"}
{"text":"We had a 3 course peking duck and bean curd side dish. The meal included red bean soup (dessert). It was all very tasty and reasonably priced. Only complaint is the male bathroom stall is broken!"}
{"text":"Our favourite to go to place for peking duck course meal. They use to be located behind Pacific Mall so they were always busy no matter what time of the day but they have moved to Thornhill at Yonge and Steeles area so I do not find it busy as much except on the weekends.  We always order the Szechuan Shredded Beef or also known as Crispy Beef. It is sweet and a little spicy but you can ask to make it not spicy. The peking duck is very crispy, they will show you the duck first before they will cut it and serve it on top of shrimp chips."}
{"text":"Ordered from here a couple of times, both dine in and take out. The food is decent and worth trying. However watch what you order, as a few dishes (esp. the duck) are pricey for chinese food. As opposed to other yelpers the duck is not something my party and I are fans of, as after two minutes the duck is cold and has a funky taste to it and the skin doesn't stay crispy for longer than a few minutes.. we much prefer the crispy beef and the duck stir fry which is really tasty! Be advised cash only"}
{"text":"If you the best Peking duck then this is the place to be.  I have been coming here for years and they have some of the best Chinese food in Scarborough.  Some great dishes to get is the crispy beef, the lobster, their specialty noodles, the sweet and sour fish and so much more.  I like at the end they give you a fortune cookie.  Always believe in receiving good fortune."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time. Had a hankering for Peking duck. 2 course for $39.99, 3 for $45.99. We opted for the 2 course, schezuan crispy beef and seafood tofu soup. The soup was tasty. The Peking duck was pretty decent, just a little under seasoned. The crispy beef was disappointing seeing that this is one of their popular dishes. It was definitely crispy but not much flavour. The restaurant decor is a little tired. Could use a freshening up. I'll come back again for Peking duck."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, it's a family oriented restaurant. We ordered the thing they're famous for, the Peking duck. That, I can tell you confidently is the only reason to go there. Cheap as all hell and D E L I C I O U S! While every other aspect of the restaurant was par, I'll still be coming back."}
{"text":"Brought here by local Yelper friends to try the Peking duck.  Would really not have noticed this place otherwise.  Located at the outer edge of Market Village, its listed as a \"Mandarin\" and \"Szechuan\" restaurant.  Dining room has several family-style round tables; not a big space but comfortable.  Never got particularly crowded but still filled up during prime dinner time.  My benchmark is the Peking duck I had at Quanjude in Wangfujing in Beijing, an incomparable start-to-finish experience that had me avoiding Peking duck in North America ever since.  Chung King's basic version involves bringing to the table the glistening, whole duck for inspection (cue ooohing and ahhhing and shameless picture-taking), but steals the rest of the show by removing it back to the kitchen for disassembly.  The sliced duck and all-important skin arrives back with a bamboo steamer of Chinese pancakes, and condiments (sliced cucumber, scallions, hoisin sauce).  Beautiful to behold, with proper accompaniments.  We dug in and made what amounted to mini burritos to enjoy.  The duck skin here is the best I've had outside of Beijing, crisp and thin, delicious.  The duck meat less remarkable, but its not really the highlight anyway.  Pancakes ok.  I prefer sweet bean sauce over hoisin.  Note you'll be charged an extra $0.50 per extra pancake; I don't think they're worth having more of.  The second course that comes with an order of Peking duck is a minced duck stir-fry meant for preparing lettuce wraps to eat.  This was good.  Note you'll be charged an extra $0.25 per extra piece of lettuce.  We also ordered the third course, which was a delicious duck soup made from the bones, coming later in the meal.  Enjoyed the flavors of this one a lot.  Being the gluttons we are, of course we strayed off the plan to just have Peking duck, so we also ordered (what I think was) a kind of fried beef dish, ever so slightly spicy, pretty well fried, and just made me want a cold beer (i.e., it makes a good bar snack), and also a good plate of sautéed baby bok choy.  With all the fat going around, that was probably a good idea.  Would highly recommend having the Peking duck as I've yet to have a better version in North America, certainly not in my hometown NYC."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, I would recommend this restaurant for their Crispy Beef, Snow Pea Leafs (to-miaw), fried vermicelli (cha-misua) and Peking Duck.  It is best to go their with a family of at least four, just so you can try a large variety of dishes.  It is not a cheap place and is cash only so be prepared to spend about $80 for four people.  Chung King Garden is located at Market Village (4394 Steeles Ave E, Markham, ON) and being a Chinese mall, plan your times accordingly because it can get up to 50% the chaos of Manila driving within the compound which is 100,000% more chaotic than normal city driving in Toronto and parking is limited during peak hours.  Some history: I'm a regular at this place now, so they may treat me a bit better, but I still hear complaints from some of my friends who go there without me.  This place was on my blacklist for two whole years a while back because of bad service.  The thing that brought me back was the dish called Crispy Beef thanks to my Uncle L.  Their rendition of Crispy Beef they make is by far the best among all the places I have tried.   I've tried other places such as Coconut Garden and although Coconut Garden had better texture, the taste of Chung King is still hard to beat.  It's a bit spicy, but I can tolerate it even if I can't take spicy food too much.  It is best eaten at the restaurant as soon as it arrives.  It is not too bad when you take it home, but it is miles apart in terms of quality when it was freshly made.  This dish goes very well with their fried vermicelli.  The fried vermicelli which we normally refer to as cha-misua is a tastier (and less healthy) rendition of the noodles we eat on our birthdays.  It's a carbohydrate dish that I would use as a filler when I have a lot of guests.  Ignoring the fact that it is a bit on the oily side, this dish is very tasty and can buffer the heat from the Crispy Beef so it balances things out.  Now because this dish is a bit oily, I would recommend you eat it with some veggies, namely the snow pea leaves.  The snow pea leaves which we refer to as to-miaw allow us to at least feel less guilty that we are eating mostly unhealthy stuff. Personally I am not really fond of vegetables, but this dish goes very well in balancing out the oiliness of the other two dishes and is one of the few vegetable dishes I would crave for.   Now although the three dishes above can make a good family meal, for occasions you would need something extra.  That would be the three-course version of the Peking Duck and Chung King Garden makes one of the better ones in the places I have eaten in Toronto.   I think the only issue we have is they don't show us the duck being carved on the table (space is very limited in the restaurant) and as such it sometimes feels like you are not getting the whole duck.  The first course of the duck is the skin and a little meat served on top of shrimp crackers (chicharon) wrapped in a thin dough wrapper, some green onions (yuck) and cucumber with hoi-sin sauce.  I personally like this a helluva lot more than that bread they give you at Peking Man.  However, they also charge extra for the wrappers so watch out for that one.  In a big event, this is what I start with as the appetizer along with the to-miaw.  The second course of the duck is the diced up insides pan fried a little and garnished with some fried noodles and other small veggies.  You eat it with lettuce and hoi-sin sauce.  Not really too fond of this one because it tends to get a bit messy.  On a big event I would have this served at the same time as the crispy beef and cha-misua.  The third course is the bone and soup with a bit of tofu.  Though I dislike this because of the bones, it is what makes this dish taste good.  I like drinking the soup to warm up my tummy near the end of the meal to make sure there is room for dessert (which we usually bring during a big event) and get rid of any lingering yuckiness from the oils in the food so we can taste the dessert a bit better.  Although those dishes I have stated are good, as far as their other dishes go for the most part I would say they are a miss or I could have had better and cheaper else where which is why I won't recommend them unless you are adventurous.  However, one thing I have to say is the quality of their food is consistent.  If I don't like it once chances are I won't like it again, conversely if I liked it once I would want to eat it over and over again.  This was a comment I had with Peking Garden at Greenbelt Makati that although their Peking Duck was the best ever I had tasted the first time I went there, the second time I went there was below the top 10 places I would eat Peking duck.  For me consistency is important as well when it comes to judging a restaurant.  Hopefully their service improves and remains consistent as time progresses, thankfully it has a bit for me, but for newbies they may have issues."}
{"text":"Glancing outside into restaurant, it doesn't seem much of an appeal.  Tables and furniture are dated, taped and rocky.   We were a party of eight so I ordered the Beijing duck two course ( it was nice n crispy), lettuce cold n crisp, chicken fried rice, spring rolls, fried chicken pieces with sweet n sour sauce on side ( favorite among all in the party), taro nest filled with seafood n Veggies ), fried thin yellow noodles with seafood, deep fried bananas and apples with honey.  Will stay with the bananas in future.  Nice experience.  Bill was $170 tax in."}
{"text":"Came for Peking Duck dinner. Every other table came for it too judging by the amount of ducks that were walked by our table! Yum  Location:  Currently in the market place behind pacific mall but the owner or manager was telling another table that they'll be moving sometime soonish because they are tearing it down to build a new complex.  Parking situation:  Pacific mall so it's can be a bit nuts. Although, I went at 6 on a Saturday and there were spaces a plenty. When we left it was a bit fuller but cool.  Inside:  This is a place for groups. Full of round tables that fit up to 12 but has a couple of square tables that were pushed together with a larger group at it.  Food:  Good. They have set courses which was what we got and what it looks like everyone else got. There's a menu that we picked additional dishes from but looks like most came for the set courses   The food came fast, was fresh, tasted great and came with very generous portions! I can see why everyone comes!!   Cost: Pretty good. We ordered so much that there was no room on the table for everything and it cost $30 per person. Tonnes left over!  Conclusion:  Will most definitely be back!!"}
