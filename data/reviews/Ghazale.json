{"text":"This is a really great option for shawarma wraps and plates. The variety is really good and the portions are fantastic. The flavours are very rich, & there's a couple of options I haven't seen at other shawarma places. I originally had a better review on this place, but I've noticed somewhat of a decline in their food quality since I started going there. It's as three stars suggests, just A-Ok."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Shwarma I had ever had! Service with a smile, tasty, and late hours. I would highly recommend for everyone to have it"}
{"text":"They go by the name Lebanon Express.  The food is fresh but it is shoveled at the customers without much care. We went on a very hot evening,  hoping to enjoy a good meal and some much - needed air conditioning, and two of the booths or tables were taken up by the staff, either doing some accounting or eating themselves.  It was clear that the customers are not their number one priority.  The food was okay: nothing special though. Ali Baba's is a better bet."}
{"text":"The bartender at The Mod Club Theatre, Lisa, told me the place was \"really good\" so me and my friend Ardith took a walk.  Thought I'm not writing much here about \"Ghazale,\" I am here to say that it IS in fact \"really good\" and possibly one of the best.  Get the beets bizness on your falafel...real good for you and tasty.  Great place for a quick meal with some protein!   They also have rice and beans you can throw in a container for a PSMM.  (Post-Show-Midnight-Meal)  ~Dave \"Herremannen\" Heilman"}
{"text":"I wouldn't come back to this place ever again. The guy was throwing garbage out side when I parked my car I went inside he wanted to make our shawarma sandwiches without washing his hands and both of them weren't wearing gloves. We asked the guy to wear gloves he didn't want to he said that's he washed his hands! Very disgusting we left the place without buying!!"}
{"text":"This place was probably the worse meal I've ever had before in my life. Food is dripping in excess oil, not even middle eastern, and everything is heated up in a microwave. Just grossssssss"}
{"text":"Your probably not thinking Middle Eastern food when taking a stroll through \"Little Italy\".  But in the event that your taste-buds are craving something different,  I recommend that you give Ghazele a try.    Today I had the Combo Plate, Tender pieces of Chicken Shwarma, with Yellow Cauliflower and Potato Rice, 3 falafel balls, and Tabouli Salad.  Comes with a Pita, and they gave me some hummus at no charge.   Great value for your money.  And the food tasted very clean and delicious.  They even have a small patio, for people watching or catching some sun.    The place is very simple, the service very polite, the food very satisfying.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The place was empty on a Saturday afternoon, but the service was very friendly and fast. We bought 2 falafel sandwiches for $8, which is a fantastic deal. Huge size for just the sandwich, easily a dinner size. Fresh ingredients, friendly staff. Unbelievably this was our first visit, but certainly not our last. Based on our visit today I would definitely recommend this Ghazale location."}
{"text":"I arrived drunk late one night when everything was closed and was very satisfied with the shawarma that I ordered.  I then came back again while sober and wasn't as impressed. The main problem for me was construction and pita quality. The pita was very plain and it completely fell apart as I was trying to eat. The meat had decent spices, but was sitting in a warming tray instead of being cut right off the spit. The vegetables tasted fine. It was just OK.  I also had a samosa, which was better than expected. There was a weird mix of soft and crunchy packet (because it was cooked and then re-heated in the microwave), but the filling was actually quite flavourful and tasty.  I wish A La Turque was still as good as when it first opened. I really don't know where to go for shawarma around Church/Wellesley anymore. If anyone can help  me, send a message my way!"}
{"text":"I MISS these falafels.  When I moved to Little Italy I was so happy to see that there was a ghazale here; until I tried it. They do things in the same style, the hummus and tabouleh are still great, but their falafels have a completely different recipe; way more bread crumbs or something  The only downside to this location is the fact that they microwave everything, but that is across the board with ghazale. Their falafels are SO good, and huge. Their potatoes and rices are great too."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here twice, and Both times I got a chicken wrap and some baklava, and both are super tasty! I get very full and the food is delicious! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Foods are fine. I'm a returning customer Bcs I love extremely near by. All the male servers there are friendly and nice, but the female server on Thursday morning shift is a real bitch....tells me that for a lil more sauce and veggie I need to put 75 cents more when I had never been asked by any other server before. It's not abt the money, it's the bitchy attitude that need to be fixed"}
{"text":"Popped in last night for a late night snack and was very unimpressed with the overall taste of the Chicken Shwarma. Could barely taste any meat in there, and was just flavourless. They microwaved my samosa and would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Really, really fantastic food. The falafel, even for my falafel-snob husband, is beyond compare.  All salads are incredibly fresh. And delicious! They really let the ingredients speak for themselves. And it is VERY reasonably priced!  I go to their booth in the food building anytime I go to the Ex, too. The staff are ridiculously friendly and even amid all those choices, Ghazale stands out.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went there for a falafel but they didn't have any. They said they were still frozen. That is gross. Who wants to eat thawed out falafel that's not fresh. Very disappointed. Get it together."}
{"text":"I love this place, great food and such nice people.   I have had chicken shawarma and falafel pitas and both are delicious, they have awesome garlic sauce and good toppings. They also have awesome samosas. Finally, the people who work here are so nice and friendly and welcoming, these people want your business and they act like it.   Prices are good, I believe the falafel pita is $3.79, which is a really good."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple times when the old lady was cooking and it was good as the food was fresh. Last couple times have been all downhill and now after my last visit Im just totally turned off due to food freshness and sanitary practices becoming an apparent issue.  Old rice, meat and fish sitting out un-refridgerated and not under heat lamps. They obviously prepare large batches of menu items ahead of time and then just leave them out uncovered at room temperature all day and night. Everything looks old and unappetizing. Everything heated up in a microwave. I never see the old lady in there anymore.  Thats not all for questionable food safety practices as on my last visit I saw money being handled by staff with their plastic gloves on and the gloves were not changed before handling more food. I walked out without ordering. Not going back."}
{"text":"Great all-round Middle Eastern take out. I live close and have options, and this is the one. Recent renos made things even better. The microwave noted below sees hardly any use and everything seems laid out a bit better. Try the hot sauce... It's thicker than other places and more rich than spice. Great value as you'd expect for shwarma, especially for the 'hood. Small seating area outside, depending on weather. Lots of regulars."}
{"text":"Great gem in the heart of Little Italy! Always fresh, delicious & well priced! Chicken Shwarma, Tabouli, hummus, soup etc ... Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant à emporter quand on a besoin d'un shawarma au falafel, au poulet ou au boeuf, ou un petit quelque chose avec un goût méditerranéen. Les prix sont abordables et les quantités généreuses. D'une qualité supérieure à des restaurants semblables, je vous recommande Ghazale sans hésiter !  Une quatrième étoile ce soir pour la continuité dans la bonne humeur et l'excellence des plats."}
{"text":"Late night middle eastern. The place was looking tired for quite awhile. And they would put out minimal amounts of food. The food would look unpalatable. Now they've replaced the tables and seating. They also have loads more food that looks appealing. Late at night you might find an occasional less advantaged person taking a snooze at one of the tables. Good for the staff for not kicking them out into the cold. Lentil soup is great except my last dose was cold. Falafel is typical of most falafel joints, pre-cooked and would taste better if it was cooked at the time of serving. Keep up the trend of getting better."}
{"text":"I go here on average once every 1 or 2 weeks. The food is delicious and the prices are amazing. If I supplement the meal with a salad and glass of milk, 1 chicken plate lasts me 2-3 meals (more often 3). But as cheap as it may be, the food is SO flavourful and is usually pretty fresh. I always chat with a couple of really friendly people who work there; they're always smiling and you can tell they're proud of the food they make and the service they provide, and rightly so. Check this place out of you want a flavourful, hearty, filling meal. Also, the hot sauce they make is INSANELY delicious."}
{"text":"I had a chicken shawarma pita combo for lunch here a few days ago. First of all, the shawarma is not cut fresh off the spit. This was in a warming tray and he took a portion to heat it up (I think on a flatop, but I'm not really sure. I hope it wasn't the microwave as one other review suggested). I went with everything on the wrap and I can't fault them for the variety or freshness of the vegetables.  What I can fault them for is the chicken. The chicken doesn't have a lot of flavour or texture (none of those lovely crunchy outside bits that I love) and there were a few knobs of cartilage that I kept pulling out of my mouth while I ate my sandwich. No bueno. Not at all. I hate biting down into cartilage. Ugh.   Also, the hot sauce is not particularly hot.  I will give them this: they do have an amazing assortment of sides. Salads, hot sides, two kinds of rice, vegetables. You name it."}
{"text":"I can't stand Ghazale.  Worst falafel ever. They microwave your falafel."}
{"text":"These Lebanese guys serve up some of the most consistently delicious falafels downtown. For $4.25, you can get yourself a hearty and delicious middle eastern delight at 10pm on a weekday. Always friendly, always fast. Yes, they do microwave their sandwiches. I don't mind - I microwave my food too. The way they do it, the pita kisses them crispy falafels and lovely tahini sauce just right.   I have also tried their sides: both the fafa beans and rice are knockouts."}
{"text":"Went to Ghazale's while I was in university and still go there now. The chicken Schworm a is still good even at 4 AM. Flavor wise it tastes distinct from Ali Baba and I can't exactly say why... Different spices I suppose. I've got to say the price per wrap has gone up but the taste definitely beats Ali's."}
{"text":"Whether you go day or 1 am the food is always fantastic. They clearly make homemade sauces in house daily which are amazing! The prices are also all you can ask for for the large portions you receive!"}
{"text":"Shawarma, Meat plate, Slim plate, and their Beet salad are all great value! The best part about Ghazale is its convenience and consistency. I wish they had more toppings available for Shawarma (pickles, pickled turnip, red hot sauce, etc.) however their addition of pickled cabbage to their shawarma and awesome garlic sauce make up for it. In terms of price, convenience, taste, and nutrition it is hard to beat Ghazale for fast-food in the neighborhood. I have gone here at least once a week since August 2017."}
{"text":"I have never heard of this place before and it was only because i was across the road in lily lounge and was feeling peckish that i decided to cross the road and grab a late night snack on my way home.  Ordered a Shawarma and then saw they had some samosas too, so ended up ordering both a meat and a vegetable.   I started my walk towards Bathurst and decided to first deal with the samosas. First the meat, COLD. Spat the first bite out and binned it. Then the vegetable samosa, COLD and again in the bin.   The chicken Shawarma was as always from my experience a belly filler and generally consists of tasteless meat so i was not expecting much from this and my low expectations were met.   I was there at 1am-ish and the place was not even that busy so can not think of an excuse to give me cold food."}
{"text":"I ordered from foodara and though the food arrived on time I was a bit bummed about the lack of sauce in my meal though the description said there would be sauce. The chicken was a bit tasteless to be honest."}
{"text":"It's actually called Lebanon Express!   I am friggin addicted to this place. I have had chicken and beef shawarma's here probably ten times now. They have the highest quality chicken and beef I have seen at a shawarma place. The chicken is good chicken breast. YUP! Their sides are awesome too. Just glancing at the salads and ingredients makes my mouth water. I highly recommend this place. Also, all of the staff are very friendly and it's quick. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This shawarma & Middle Eastern food chain serves up pretty fresh veggies with their solid tasting shawarma wraps. They even have jerk shawarma which is becoming more popular. I haven't sampled theirs yet but have at Ziggy's which is nicely spiced if you're into that. And daily they make a few stewed veg sides which comes with your shawarma plate.  If you want a quick bite and you're in the area give 'em a try. Tell them Sidiq sent you and they'll just look at you funny ;)"}
{"text":"This is authentic middle eastern shawarma and situated right in the middle of the action on Bloor St. it's a reveler's dream spot for a snack. With three stools and a small counter to eat at, it's a perfect spot to take a break from the action or hit it up before seeing a movie at the Hot Docs theatre right next door which is what we did that Saturday night.  It was perfect! I had the beef shawarma with tasty shards of beef along with the usual toppings, it was hearty and chock full of fresh ingredients. The whole glass counter was overflowing with freshly made food ready for the evening ahead. The place is so tiny that the garbage bins are outside the door! And the tabbouleh salad was very good with fresh greens and packed tightly in its container it was almost a meal in itself. Very refreshing and a great compliment to the shawarma. A combo with a pop was about $10 which is fantastic for a healthful meal such as this. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast.  The beef shawarmas are delicious, just be sure it isn't dripping!    Both the beef and veggie samosas are greasy, but very tasty."}
{"text":"Wow. Some of the best quick-ish food / value I've ever had. Definitely the best eating I had on my trip to Toronto. This is the kind of restaurant you wish you could take him with you. Service is quick but very kind. I would think twice before getting the samosas though, because although they aren't bad per se they are not as good as the rest of the food. I paid much more money for much less flavorful Middle-Eastern food in other parts of the city and I wish I could take it all back and go to Ghazale."}
{"text":"I have had really good experiences at this location.  Food is really good and fresh.  I usually order a chicken shawarma with a few falafel balls on the side.  They always fry the falafel fresh and shawarma is made properly with tender meat."}
{"text":"I've been here at 3am after a night out, but also on regular evenings when I'm having a craving for Middle Eastern food. This place has never disappointed. I've only ever had their shwarma wraps, but out of the 10 or 15 times I've had one they are consistently delicious. They're also filled to the max with all the typical toppings, so a single $6 wrap totally fills me up!  Sure, you don't go here for the ambience. But if you want delicious, quick and very satisfying shwarma, this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"My favourite shawarma in the village, (but not my alltime)  This restaurant is so clean, that it impresses. Everything in this restaurant feels recently cleaned and the food looks fresh. I think their sandwiches are great, beef, chicken and falafel. There are some fresh squeezed juices, TV playing news station constantly. Open super late (4am)  Customer service is generally good, quick"}
{"text":"This place is one of my go to in this area! I usually get their chicken shawarma, the eggplant dish, and rice with lentils. I have tried the mushroom dish and it's just not my preference. It's sweet as if it's dessert.   I'm not gonna judge it by its decor. However, the place is visibly clean. No bugs flying around is always a plus to me!   The service is great! The servers are always smiling and helpful. I've never had any issues. Promise. Lol. Anyways, I definitely recommend this place to anyone:)"}
{"text":"If someone gave me 100$ to spend on any meal in Toronto ,I'd still go for the 7.99 beef shawarma plate at Ghazales with three sides.  Ingredients always great, the cut of meat never too fatty, their soups and rice and lentils are great as well.  Friendly staff.  Great neighborhood spot, very barebones looking but the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Just ordered the chicken shawarma. This thing was ridiculously good. Makes every other shawarma I have had feel shame."}
{"text":"Super nice people, they ll help you pick what you want! For a vegetarian it helps a lot ahah He food was really good! I went late evening and it tasted super fresh! I love hat they warm up the whole wrap so it s not cold!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, ordered a chicken shawarma plate assuming it would be the usual set up of salad, chicken, rice that is offered at most shawarma joints but alas the vegetable options were varying potatoes and soups it looked like. Ended up getting chicken, rice, double potatoes. At the end When asked if I wanted sauce I said yes both sauces, assuming they would use hot and garlic as is the norm. Instead the woman working gave me hummus, a garlic sauce that was basically salad dressing but much thicker, and when I asked again for hot sauce I was given hot green salsa.  At this point I'm slightly annoyed because imo the sauces really make or break shawarma platters but order my platter+drink and the total is 11.84. Sit down to eat and the food is almost inedible, the potatoes were dry despite having been sitting in oil, the chicken had next to no seasoning, basically just oil flavoured. Rice was alright, again it was dry and with no sauce to moisten it, wasn't good either.   Overall, a rip off at that price, would avoid. Much better shawarma for 12 dollars in Toronto."}
{"text":"I particularly enjoy this restaurant for great tasting food and always friendly staff. Great for take out and also has a nice outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite middle eastern place in the city by a mile. The staff are amazingly nice, the food is always good, and the service is faster than a one legged man in an ass-kicking competition.  I eat here a pluralized amount per week."}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicken Shawarma with Lentil Soup. The stuffing wasn't well blend. Chicken was mainly on one side and the vegetables on the other side. Would be better if chicken was in the middle and vegetable on the sides. As for the taste of the shawarma, it was pretty good. The mild hot sauce didn't overwhelm the taste of the chicken. You will have bad breath after eating due to strong taste of garlic. The lentil soup was a disappointment. It was just re-heat from the microwave. Tastes like liquid potato."}
{"text":"Wonderful combo plates and tons of choices. I love the mousakka, shrimp, yellow chicken rice, and okra options. Friendly guys working there. Extremely affordable."}
{"text":"Very fresh and nothing objectionable; good value and seems as though it's a neighbourhood favorite. Not amazing, but pretty tasty. Nothing stands out except the prices, which were very fair. It wasn't busy when we were there. Not fine dining, no amazing creations, but the Shawarma was very good."}
{"text":"I would say that this is my most visited Shawarma places in the city, mostly because of it's location and its open till 4am.  The prices are cheap, and the fillings a'plenty.  Note:  In the summer, open concept. The have like a huge windowed garage door type contraption that they open and you can sit on the streets :)  The have those authentic coke bottles :) So NEAT!  The have the combo platters too which are awesome. Not the best quality IMO, but great if you want to try out different middle eastern foods.  Get the spinach and cheese pie if they have it.   :)"}
{"text":"Avoid this place!! I went here with some friends because we live nearby and the smell of the food was great every time we've walked by. We finally went to this place and got some swarma, mix plate of food and baklava.  The food wasn't bad but we noticed ants on the baklavas still moving around.  When we went back to the cashier to exchange it, we noticed a swarm of ants all over the dessert counter on all of their food.  I can't imagine the status of their sanitation and other foods after seeing this.  Food: 1/5, my swarma wasn't bad, moist chicken and tangy sauce but I had a bad taste subconsciously after seeing the ants.  Service: 1/5, average service when ordering but they didn't show any remorse when we came up to show them about the ants.  Ambience: 2/5, old and dark but sometimes this isn't too bad as some restaurants still serve great food but this with questionable food makes a bad mix.  Price: 1/5, too expensive for swarma in Toronto. I could go to most places for $5 wraps but this place came up to $8.  Not sure if this is worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious! Super flavorful! Our new favorite middle eastern option in the area. Great levels of garlic and spiciness."}
{"text":"Just an UPDATE:  They just got a Yellow Card on DineSafe on June 24.    Ghazale is a cornerstone of the late night food scene in the Church-Wellesley Village.  You can expect your standard Middle Eastern fare here in a quick-service style.  There is space to eat in or take out.  This is part of a mini-chain of 5 restaurants in Toronto.  The original is in the Annex.   The FOOD here is generally fairly average with some notable standouts on either end: ~The lentil soup is totally awesome.  Completely vegetarian, nicely peppery.  This is my go-to option when I don't feel like cooking.  It's healthy, filling, and always warm.  Super cheap too.  ~The stuffed grape leafs are totally awful.  I've tried them twice, and both times they were too oily to finish.  I know they're supposed to have some oil, but this looked like they were sponsored by BP. (Too soon?)  ~The falafel is a bit sub-par.  I'm sure the falafel are delicious when freshly made.  Unfortunately, at least in this location, they've been sitting around for some number of hours chilling before being microwaved.  This treatment is pretty evident in the taste.  I would pay an extra dollar if they would just fry them fresh for me.  ~The shawarma options are in the middle.  Generally tasty, but definitely not the homemade shawarma that the best middle eastern places do.  This has been made in a factory and shipped.  The SERVICE is always friendly and fast.  Overall, it's very good VALUE.  I never spend a lot of money here, and when I get the lentil soup, I'm totally satisfied.  In short, stick to the lentil soup.  TIP: They are open until 3 AM, so take advantage of them for your post-bar needs...it's definitely tastier than the Pizza Pizza next door."}
{"text":"Came here post yelp event. The venue itself is pretty dingy. I wasn't really expecting much so it wasn't really surprising. Had the chicken shwarma wrap. The taste was ok. I didn't find their ingredients that fresh, but it wasn't too bad either."}
{"text":"Everything was reheated in a microwave and tasted like it had been sitting out all day. Probably the worst chicken shawarma dinner I've ever had. Was really disappointed because I was hoping this could be my go-to shawarma place in the area."}
{"text":"What a welcome addition to a street filled with overpriced, mediocre food all over the place.  This place serves fresh healthy alternative fast food at a very reasonable price.  The sign says \"Lebanon Express\" but it's Ghazale, so if you're familiar with that chain you'll know what to expect.  I had the chicken shawarma plate with potatoes, lentil salad and kale apple salad, topped with tahini and garlic sauce.  What most people won't realize with this meal (or possibly care - but they should!) is that it's totally gluten and dairy free.  There are eggs in the garlic sauce but that's as close as it gets to being dairy.  I also had fresh mango juice.  Came to just above $16 and I left feeling full and very satisfied.  Thank you Ghazale, you are the perfect answer to my fussy diet.  Great staff, great food, very clean restaurant, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The food is good, but they need to figure out how to keep it warmer.  I don't like nuking everything.   Falafels are excellent as is the onion rice."}
{"text":"This place is all about value. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find so much flavorful food for so little anywhere else! Seriously, you will not be leaving hungry or broke. This isn't fancy \"foodie\", but it tastes fresh and it's always fast.  The service here is good and I'd be happy to return many times.   There are numerous vegetarian options and the selection trumps your average falafel hut/stand by a mile.  Come here with a group of friends and order to share - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Don't miss this 5 Star experience!!! Just the best food! such Wonderful Service! I suggest their falafel or vegetable samosas. Might just be one of the three best restaurants in Toronto! They press their falafel and sandwiches too.great prices. Not good decor. But nicely quiet and sunglare free.spacious. Maybe a good place for a date?Though it is a fast food-like setup."}
{"text":"This place is gross. I found a hair in my dried out plate of food. The only reason to come here is if you're hungry at 3am after partying in the village. For falafel, go to Mama's which is on Church just north of Wellesley on the east side. I don't know if they're there anymore but this place is kinda gross. They're better than falafel place beside Kaiseki-Sakura though."}
{"text":"Unlike the hole in the wall original, this Ghazale is much larger with space to sit down to enjoy your meal - no more balancing on the edge of a concrete planter while fighting off pesky pigeons! In the brighter, uncramped space, you'll feel less hurried when trying to make your choice(s) from the many tasty (and mostly vegetarian friendly) options.  At 3am last night - they're open until 4am every night(!), I excitedly ordered the \"any four dishes special\" ($6.99) which was topped off nicely with a generous dollop of creamy hummous and an unruly squirt of hot sauce. My selections of okra in tomato sauce, leafy wilted spinach, mushy eggplant with chickpeas, and savoury fried rice with (frozen type) veggies all proved to be harmonious and delicious choices.   When asked what else he would recommend, the cashier gave the lentil soup a good stir and pointed out that it's only $1 for a small! I'm also a big fan of the dolmades (grape leaves), so those together will make a nice little snack on my next visit.  The only complaint I have is that they warm up the whole shebang in the microwave to an often uneven effect. If I could stave off the hunger pangs, (which is frankly unrealistic on post-party Saturday 3am's), I would rather take the food home and reheat it myself."}
{"text":"Don't let the drab exterior fool you, this place serves amaaaaaaazing food. Staff were incredible too. Definitely a hidden gem. Recommendations? Try everything. I got 4 or 5 different items and they were all incredible."}
{"text":"Tasty and good value. Pleasant counter staff. Bright and clean establishment. A good variety of dishes and specials to choose from. Plenty of seating"}
{"text":"great neighbourhood take out/dine in middle eastern joint. everything seems hygienic, clean, food is good every time and staff is polite. prices are okay I guess since food is good and healthy. we eat here often :) mostly chicken shawarma veggie platter."}
{"text":"this is nothing like Lebanon express from my neighbourhood. Meat is not fresh but microwaved and greasy and sides choices are different. on the bright side it's at a convenient location for many, open late and prices are cheaper. service is fast and portions are big. however, unless you came only for salad, don't expect anything fresh."}
{"text":"Ghazale has to have the best middle eastern sandwiches in Toronto.  YUM.  Although they have quite a limited menu, they make their limited selections amazingly well.    My favourite here is the veggie sandwich - packed with things like potato, turnip, deep fried eggplant, and the usual fixings (pickled turnip, lettuce, tomato, onions, etc.)  Even if you're not a vegetarian this is amazing.  I haven't tried the chicken schwarma or the beef schwarma but I have heard it is delicious.  No sandwich is over $5!  BARGOONS!    Also, they have wrapped the sandwiches in a way that ensures that it's not too messy.    Topped off with a mango juice and you're off to the races.  This definitely hits the spot any time, especially after a late night out."}
{"text":"Been there a few times for its convenience. Over all the sides salads and vegetables are pretty good, but the meats are pretty dry. There are way better shawarmas and falafels spots out there."}
{"text":"want a heckin huge amount of superb food for little dollars? this is yr spot. in the last 3 months, i've ordered the meat combo plate upwards of 10 times. meat + 3 veg sides for $11? swoon city. it's so huge you can convince yourself yr just buying groceries.   i go chicken, falafel, hummus, taboule. i haven't really deviated from that, because it's so perfect that i'm scared to try new things. it comes with a pita, and garlic sauce that'll knock yr socks off.   with both late night & morning delivery, this place can take care of your drunken cravings or heal yr hangover the next day. i know."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I have been to Ghazale's several times.  I got a chicken shawarma salad plate today, and it was so good!  The ingredients they use are very fresh - today's fattoush salad was excellent.  The girls that work there are also very nice and friendly.  This is my go-to when craving Lebanese food!"}
{"text":"I used to go to grab dinner at the Ghazale on Bloor next to the theatre formally known as The Bloor cinema often, and it was always kind of a cluster fuck. It was continuously worth it, though, because their foods are impossibly fresh.  Enter the College location! I popped in for some eats after a few drinks at a nearby choir concert (yes, you read that right). I was walking home and determinedly typing \"falafel\" and \"shawarma\" into my Yelp app and this Ghazale popped up. Aaaaaaahhh. A beacon of light.   Same incredibly fresh toppings, soft chicken and not greasy falafel. Same funny guys behind the counter putting together your wraps and up-selling you on delicious extras. Best of all, it wasn't crowded with drunk people (aside from me) or running-late movie-goers. Tada."}
{"text":"great veggie options  very impressed with the quality of the combo i had  excellent portions"}
