{"text":"The food was very good! I had the quinoa bowl and added chicken (delicious addition!). The staff was friendly and helpful when describing the menu. I'm excited for this new addition to Bryant Street!"}
{"text":"I had specials for the night- cream of mushroom soup and a pasta with seven different kinds of mushroom. It was outstanding. 
It was a little pricey for me- $24. However, I will definitely have a great lunch tomorrow"}
{"text":"Awesome! 

I took some pictures of the menu... If there is anything on there that looks appealing to you, I guarantee it will be delicious. Just try it.

BYOB."}
{"text":"Lucky and surprised to enjoy such a good meal at this newly opened restaurant.  Usually it takes some time to work out the kinks but our meal was delicious and we will definitely be back.  Started with the locally foraged chanterelle mushroom appetizer - the special today.  It was amazing.  Cooked with garlic and tomato. Served with crostini.  Lick the bowl good. 

I had the portobello bun where the portobello was the bun and stuffed with hummus, tomato slices, avocado, squash and onion.  My son had the fried chicken bun. He said the chicken was light, moist and tender.  Both of our \"buns\" were served with a couscous salad that had lots of tomato and cucumber.  Light and summery. We also had the tator tots.   They were also very good.  Shredded potatoes in small tots drizzled with a light cheese sauce and bacon. Ate every last one. 

The menu was a bit overwhelming for us. So many choices that looked amazing. It took us awhile to decide.  I can't wait to come back and try the buckwheat bowl!!  Happy to patronize a new locally owned restaurant.  I was amazed at the quality given they just opened. Wait staff was friendly and energetic.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Got a phone call a few hours before going there with a party of 8 that the whole menu had changed and that they now had only a few ramen bowls. No more information etc. So unprofessional"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and sat outside.It was a late lunch during the week so they weren't very busy. They are BYOB, but we didn't bring anything. I'm not sure what their corkage fee would be. The menu is really varied, which always kind of worries me, but the variety of dishes we had were good. Prices were amazing. Super affordable place. I loved the look of this restaurant. Tons of plants outside and it just felt cozy and comfortable, and casual, which I liked.

I'll always miss E2, but this is a good addition to Bryant Street. I got the fried chicken sandwich, which was all right. I liked it, but I probably wouldn't get it again. Moist and tasty, but a little blander than I would have preferred. The fried were awesome though. My boyfriend got the their lunguini with clam sauce and it was amazing. I wish I had gotten that now. Tons of flavor, pretty dish, good portion size. 

I think this is a place I'll definitely check out again. Staff was friendly, service was quick. Food was awesome."}
{"text":"What's the concept? Use Apteka as a baseline for the quality and price point of your food. Shorten the size of your menu, make the focus of the menu meaningful, and perfect whatever your concept is. 

The whole earthy to be earthy idea never got me anywhere. How do you serve \"bowls\" with perogies on a plate being in the same category? Hope you reopen with a better plan. This spot deserves something special!"}
{"text":"The chicken and bone broth was excellent. The Hamachi carpaccio plated excellently and very fresh. Moderately priced."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. The pork belly and arugula appetizer is out of this world. The server Boba is amazing and the chef knocks it out of the park with his food. One of my new favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"We went there last week and they have CHANGED everything from their original menu to cut costs. And They haven't updated it on their website. 
They now only have 5-6 options to choose from. So the only option we had was noodles and they were canned ramen noodles without any flavor for $13 each. 
If you change the menu atleast update the website so that people can decide to go or not. The food didn't taste good either and as others said waitress was very busy on phone."}
{"text":"Loved the Hamachi Carpaccio - terrific lite dinner with the super flavorful chicken broth! New decor and more seating. Great service.  Definitely make a trip to Plate & Bowl."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars if weren't the fact they took so long to bring our food. I can understand that there was only one server for the whole restaurant and she was very fast and professional so it wasn't her fault at all. I just think they need more staffs.
The food is awesome in terms of taste and visual. I enjoyed my pork belly bow. Price is very competitive with restaurant with such good quality of food. 
I want go back again soon!!"}
{"text":"Plate and Bowl is a great addition to to the increasingly diverse restaurants on Bryant Street.  The bowl based dinners are a unique concept for Pittsburgh and range from Mediterranean to Asian inspired, so there's something for every taste.  We ordered way too much food for two people in order to get an idea of the menu and were pleased with both the flavors and freshness of each dish.  

Plate and Bowl is also BYOB with a relaxed casual atmosphere and the staff was very accommodating for children.  There wasn't a lot of space for stroller parking, but thats always been that case at that location."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan food. I ordered the buckwheat bowl and it was just perfect.  Super healthy and super delicious. Excellent mix of vegetables and legume to make a very satisfying dish. Other people in other party had the quinoa and couscous bowls and were also very happy.  Tho, I will would go back for my choice of  buckwheat bowl :-)"}
{"text":"I came here about a month ago and the variety of the menu was great and we loved our food.

We sat down last night and were sad to learn they only serve ramen now. We ordered the shishito pepper appetizer, the mushroom appetizer special and two bowls of ramen.

Both appetizers were pretty underwhelming and underseasoned. Overpriced mushrooms that were just fried with no flavor were disappointing, as the waitress raved about them. Needed salt for both apps. Neither of us liked our ramen, and didn't bother with taking leftovers.

The waitress was also very scattered. She had totally forgotten to put our ramen bowls order in and other people who arrived after us were then served before us. Had to ask multiple times for salt, etc. could not remember anything we had asked or ordered.

Super disappointing, especially with such a great experience with their original menu. Shouldn't mess with a good thing!"}
{"text":"Welp, came here a few weeks back for dinner. It's an odd set-up when you walk in as there are events that take place downstairs and it's not part of the restaurant (?). When we got back up to the restaurant, we were treated rather rudely. There was no sign that said 'please seat yourself' so we stood there like idiots for a minute until a waitress handed us menus and told us. The waitress barely said a word. There were no tables but we did notice a man sitting at a table making a sign (i think there was an event taking place downstairs or outside). He quite obviously wasn't eating there, but was taking up the last free table. We stood there for a few minutes and then handed our menus back and left. Don't really want to come back to try the food now."}
{"text":"We came for the grand opening celebration this weekend and were quite pleased with the delicious food and comfortable atmosphere at Plate and Bowl. There is a bit of an Asian fusion flare to each of their bowls, and the Quinoa Black Bean Bowl that I ordered was a hearty feast! The quinoa was sitting in a bath of extra broth at the base of the bowl, which at first I was taken aback to see, but once I tasted it and blended the other veggies with it, I was glad to have that extra liquid to soak up the rich Asian and umami flavors. The pricing is great for the size of the large bowls, which can be single meals or split with a friend for those less hungry. 

We will definitely be coming back and are eager to have this in our neighborhood! It was fun to enjoy the comedy show downstairs and support the local artists so we hope there will be future events like these to showcase the neighborhood's talent!

Pro tip: it is BYOB but they will charge a corking fee (I think it's $1/person who requests a glass) so it is not truly free to bring in your own alcohol."}
{"text":"We managed to get in during their soft open period and the food was top notch. The restaurant has a casual eclectic atmosphere with some of the friendliest waitstaff in town. 

We started with locally forage chanterelle mushrooms sautéed with garlic and tomatoes on toast that was so good we had a second order. We followed that up with salmon sashimi and yellow tail carpaccio that were much fresher than we expected. Our last course was the pulled pork bowl which sated my husbands desire for some heavier fare. 

If you're looking for a broad menu that has lots of different options this is the place for you. I'd say most of the food leans towards Asian food but there's lots of options. 

In a neighborhood with plenty of good competition, Plate and Bowl is shaping up to be one of our regular spots. Come and make sure you ask for Andy."}
{"text":"My new fave BYOB! Highland Park should be proud of this place, which is an Asian influenced eclectic restaurant with a strong Korean influence. Prices are VERY reasonable, the food is excellent, and it's BYOB.  We went out as a group of 5 and with apps and 5 entrees the bill was under $100, worth every penny.  Fun, interesting food, delicious and well prepared. Bulgogi fries amazing. Loved the corn fritters. I had the hamachi bowl, wonderful! GO!!"}
{"text":"Lucky enough to live right down the street from this amazing place!! 
I can't stop ordering the couscous bowl!!"}
{"text":"Excellent new restaurant! Unusual and tasty food. I'm so glad my girlfriend suggested this. Thank you."}
{"text":"For day two of a restaurant, Plate & Bowl was pretty solid. I will probably visit again after a couple of months, but, the concept is great, and the food was pretty solid.

My fiancé and I went around 6:30 pm last night, and there was a steady crowd - seating is available downstairs and upstairs. This is in the old E2 space, and the Renovation is quite nice. 

The staff was a little flustered, but natural on day two. There were a lot of servers on the floor, but there seemed to be confusion as to who was doing what. Again, something that will he worked out over time.

We started with the deviled eggs, the eggs were cooked properly, but these were nothing special. No pizazz or wow of flavor. Just average.

My fiancé wanted to try out the bahn mi. The flavor profile was there - the right notes of sweet and sour - but the bread was a little soft for a bahn mi, and the meat was dry. We asked for extra sauce.

The highlight was the couscous bowl. The presentation was gorgeous, the baba ghanosh was smoky, and the vegetables in the bowl were crisp and well flavored. This dish is a winner.

Like I said earlier, not a bad meal for day 2 of a restaurant."}
