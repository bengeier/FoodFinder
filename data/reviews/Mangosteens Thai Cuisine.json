{"text":"I must say I am very critical of restaurants and their customer service. This is a great place to order from. The chef that the have now is great. I had a problem once with the food and the owners call me back and wanted to make the situation better by being very generous and b giving my next order on the house. They really didn't need to do this as only one item was the issue. I order from here weekly and give two thumbs up to the young entrepreneurs. The delivery person is very polite and courteous . Mangosteen's management and delivery driver always remember my name and always get my order right. They say delivery will be 40 mins but I have never waited more than 30 mins. FOOD IS ALWAYS hot and fresh

BEST THAI IN THE GTA.

{"text":"Noodle dish is mediocre at best. Not impressed. Pad thai taste like one from thai express with upgraded protein potion. Even tho the service is great, the kitchen just didn't do it. Verdict: Tried once and done."}
{"text":"This restaurant took me a little by surprise. It is unconventional in the way that the waiters do not serve you (you go get the menu and order at the register). The restaurant is also a little more informal and best for lunch dining or a very casual dinner.
Despite the different ambiance the food was really, really well done. If you are looking for good Thai food at descent prices you should definitely give this place a chance."}
{"text":"A restaurant I have been meaning to try for a long time and I have finally done so.

I went with relatives for dinner and upon arrival, it was empty. Usually that's not a good thing to walk into (and it was a bit daunting), but it was understandable as the location of restaurant was really obscure.

Besides the lack of diners, although I did noticed there were people coming in to pick up food later on, I enjoyed my time there. 

It's a small, nicely designed restaurant. Modern and clean looking. The plating of the meals were great too. The server was also very helpful.

The food was tasty. I found there wasn't anything really special about the Pad Thai though, but that's just me I am and I am in no way a Thai expert, but I loved the pineapple fried rice, Green Curry  and coconut soup (and I generally dislike coconut). As for the portion size, I wouldn't say it was huge but average size for the price.

If you haven't given this restaurant a try, I'd say go for it!"}
{"text":"Although its on the Queensway, it's location still feels tucked out of the way, which is perhaps why the place is never all that busy. But don't let that make you think the food is no good or the service is terrible. Their signature Pad Thai was amazing, and their Yellow Curry and Mango Chicken Stir-fry were delicious. Our only complaint was with the waiter not writing down our order which resulted in a few trips back to ask what we ordered and still bringing a Cashew Chicken to the table."}
{"text":"Good Thai food in the Etobicoke area.

Would definitely recommend the chili fish."}
{"text":"We chose this place as it was close to the movie theatre and well, what the heck. So glad we did!
Very quiet on a Sunday night which could be off putting but we received a warm greeting and so we got comfortable. 
The menu seemed just right- standard Thai fare with some nice pictures and clever descriptions-- we were drawn to several dishes. We had the crispy spring rolls and mango salad for starters. Then we shared the pad Thai (very good- my friend who was craving it after years away in Italy declared)- light and well flavoured, not heavy or gummy. Also had a very flavourful red curry chicken. Just coconutty enough and quite spicy!  Cashew chicken and ginger beef (not crispy if that's maybe what you are expecting) rounded out the dishes and a big bowl of rice for the table. We were 3 people and had very few leftovers bc everything was so tasty. 
And the service was lovely. Attentive (lots of water refills) but not intrusive. 
I saw some take out pickups and I think deliveries going on too. 
We will definitely add this to the post-movie list, as I'd rather eat local than at a chain/box restaurant any day!"}
{"text":"A little Thai gem conveniently located near the cineplex theatre on the Queensway!

I might not have found this place without a tip from a coworker that lives in the area, and it turns out another coworkers brother owns it! So with those two recommendations, and a date at the Queensway VIP, it was an easy choice. 

The place is small, with two booths and a few tables. Based on the number of people coming in for takeout, I imagine that's a popular aspect of the place. 

We started with two apps, the fresh rolls and chicken crispy spring rolls. Both were delicious and fortunately the fresh rolls came out super quickly because I was starving! So starving that when the spring rolls came out I forgot to take a picture. Whoops. I then tasted three of the entrees, my own was the beef pad sew which was AWESOME - not light on the beef at all and the cut of meat was a higher quality than I was expecting. Yum! I also tried the curried up pad Thai and Tom yum noodles. Both were excellent! 

We were lucky enough to enjoy a banana fritter on the house which was also excellent! 

One more about the place is that there's no liquor license, which was sad because I wanted a beer! That's probably due to the takeout nature of the restaurant, and I survived. Lucky they serve alcohol at the movies. 

I could definitely see myself coming back the next time I'm in the area!"}
