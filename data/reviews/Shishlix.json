{"text":"The take out food is no good, but the food there is SUPER GOOD. So I dont know how there is such a huge difference between the food!   I would recommend it if you're gonna go and sit down to eat."}
{"text":"Chenjeh and Joojeh were so tasty. The ambient is attractive, decorated with classic drawings and décor. People were friendly and charming."}
{"text":"The people that work here are not the most inviting but the Kabob Torsh is tender and deliciously sour. Everytime we come back to Richmond Hill we get our kabob torsh fix from here. The homemade doogh is oook. The koobideh and barg are decent. Overall this is a good restaurant for a pricey take-out. If you want cheap persian take out of equal or slightly lower quality goto Tafton across the street."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing people. We go there every week because their kabob is Amazing. Pomegranate walnut stew (khoresh Fesenjoon) is a MUST."}
{"text":"As someone who is very familiar with Persian kabobs, I've heard of Shishlix for a long time. However, I never tried it as my parents had a bad experience there since they found hair in their rice and told me their cook didn't wear hair net (which I'm not sure about and must be confirmed?). But since other people I know like their food I decided to give this place a shot. I went and got takeout Barg Kabob and I said I want salad instead of rice. First of all, the Barg Kabob is $16.99 before tax, however I was charged $18.99 before tax, and came to $21 after tax. So I asked to have salad substituted for rice and I was charged two dollars more?! Second, I asked for take-out , and I got zero cutlery, only butter (oh yeah butter for my salad huh??)  and I got no napkins or spoon and fork. Details like this matter! Staff must pay attention. Always amazed how staff can forget the little things, and no they weren't busy at all! Lastly, I'm all cool with paying a little more to get great food, but don't charge your customers $21 for Barg Kabob if you simply CANNOT deliver on quality. For instance North Restaurant charges $18 for Kabob Barg and $19 for Kabob Torsh (Barg with pomegranate sauce) and it is 100% worth the cost because 1. The portion is much more, 2. The kabob is literally the best meat you'll ever taste, fresh, tender, and juicy. As with Shishlix, while they are a restaurant,  their food is simply not at the level of North (Shomal) restaurant,  thus it's ridiculous of them to be charging the same price. The Kabob Barg at Shishlix was dry, and tasted a little off. It definitely did not taste like a true Kabob Barg. If you're Iranian, you will understand this, and it was not tender at all! Looks like my parents were right. Next time I'm going to go to Shomal if I am going to pay $21 for Kabob, at least there I know they deliver on good quality food and service. My suggestion to Shishlix: reduce your prices!"}
{"text":"Nice freshly cooked food, excellent service but music too loud like it is a disco and not a dining restaurant. So loud that even waitress had difficulty taking orders (got us something different than what we ordered) and can,t even have a decent conversation. We did ask them to lower the volume but maybe other customers were there for it. Next time will make sure that no live music is scheduled.."}
{"text":"Horrible place to throw a party at. They completely ruined a private function with poor service, rudeness to guests and forgetting items. Can't believe the place is still in business."}
{"text":"This was my third time eating at shishlix. I went there on the weekend for a birthday dinner. No one finished their food. I had more than half of my fesenjan left but didn't even want to take it home. I'm not sure what happened to the restaurant, but it went from serving good food to mediocre food. That's too bad too because the service was friendly enough and the restaurant decor was recently updated. I left the restaurant feeling that I ought to take the birthday girl out for dinner again to make up for it all."}
{"text":"The food is decent and the selection is alright. However, Shishlix is really only suitable for take out.   Don't bother dining in, the service is absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Just driving by and hungry, saw the name and was curious, stopped in and was very surprised ! Great food, service was pretty good."}
{"text":"Friday night and 9pm we reached the resto. There was live music with a singer. Nice touch but way too loud to carry a conversation! We ordered the chicken kebab and lamb chops. The meats were tender and very flavourful. The side of rice is excessive so it wouls be best to break it up with half fries or salad. A large warm piece of naan is served at the table with some pickles to start. The food was good, but I don't have any reference point to know if it tasted authentic persian. I have had turkish and lebanese and it is all the same.  What was fun to see is that the patrons enjoy the dinner with some dancing in between to keep the energy levels high and fun.  it doesn't stand out as anything special or great but worth the experience."}
{"text":"Because of the ridiculous service here this place gets a 2.  ordered a couple of chicken dinners that night.   for one dinner we wanted fries instead of rice, when we mentioned this a few minutes later, she said we never told the server, well the server never even asked. said ok, we won't charge you for the fries since they had already been preparing it with rice. ok. sure.   about 20mins into the meal, asked where the fries were? also where the water was? server said the fries got burnt. ok why didn't they inform us? then was asked strangely how do we like the fries?? I was confused? definately not burnt, I was asked if we still wanted them they can go across the street (motioned with her body) to buy them elsewhere?  wtf  this has got to be the most ridiculous moment I've ever experience in a restaurant. she wanted to buy fries across the street and serve them to me?   requests are completely ignored. or things are so dumbfounded.  as for the food. it was good, not exactly as I ordered  but the service here is just terrible, and leaves a bad taste in ones mouth.   get new wait staff or just do take out only.  what a way to ruin an evening. I had to apologize to my date, saying well that the way some things are.. you can't expect good service. kind of puts a damper on trying new establishments other than the franchised restaurant places where there is some level of service."}
{"text":"I have tried this restaurant 4-5  times and the last time was after the renovation they had. I was hoping to see a better service and food and it did not happen. 1- the window tables were very  uncomfortable. chairs were fixed in the ground and far from table. I had to bend over to eat food. definitely the installation was wrong . 2- diet coke which I got for my wife and I was out of soda and like water and sugar. my request for replacement resulted in weird attitude from waitress and worst off all the soda was the same. 3- food quality was not what I expected and price was high for that food quality. 4- visiting a restaurant is not just sitting and eating. the companionship and talking and a positive atmosphere are important also. otherwise I can sit at home and eat. none of the above were existent in this restaurant. I am not going to try this one again. waste of money and time and not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Terruble customer service, especially the waiters. I come in with friends and we asked for a booth and the waiter responded \"You cannot sit there just incase a family of 6 or more comes.\" Are you serious? So you are going to dissatisfy your customer because you are ASSUMING a bigger family is going to come. To make it worst. A family of 3 was sitting at another booth, which totally contradicts what they told me. Horrible customer service and it is not worth going there. Much better persian restaurants out there for example Gilaneh and shataar abas."}
{"text":"Cams with a group of 4 people on a monday night. The food was amazing!! Juicy kababs and the portions were big. The service was great."}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good. The one thing I learned about it though is that it is BEST for take out. If you call in your order, they'll make it for you in about 10 minutes (depending on the size of your order of course, usually for a couple of people 10 mins is the average) and it really makes it easier to get your hands on some delicious tasty Persian and Mediterranean food.   Whenever I order from Shishlix, I always get the Baghali Polo with Lamb Shank: Marinated lamb shank, served over rice flavoured with dill and fava beans. This lamb really makes your mouth water with its abundance of flavour and it is a pretty big portion for the amazing price of $9.95! They also give you a small side salad which is quite good: fresh crispy lettuce is always used with fresh tomatoes, a dill pickle and a nice creamy thousand islands-type dressing.  Check it out if you're located around the Yonge/Weldrick area, but try to stay away from dining in as the service is definitely not world class!"}
{"text":"This is the fourth time this restaurant has cancelled our family's plans. Every time we want to go there they say you need reservations so this time we called to make reservations and the guy on the phone who was the manager said they don't take reservations for Sundays and it's walk in! So we go there and they say \"sorry we are closed, kitchen is sold out\"! Make up your mind! Ridiculous customer service! Will never go there... only if you have time to waste then try going!"}
{"text":"The food here is good which is why they have decided they can manage to be utterly disrespectful towards their patrons. I have to agree with another user who said the attitude here is shocking.   We went to Shishlix with a 4 year old girl as this is clearly a family restaurant. It was a Friday night and they had dancers and live music. The dancing area usually abounds with kids. At one point though, a server pulled our girl away in an attempt to make room for the performers and handed her to a staff member(?), even though we were watching over from our table nearby and she could have easily handled this differently. At this point we calmly intervened and were told by the waitress that she was instructed by the manager to do so. We quite politely asked to see the manager.  To cut a long and disappointing story short, we waited a COMPLETE hour to see the manager, who in the meantime sent out a couple of his staff members to our table with a bunch of different attitudes ranging from mildly apologetic to downright hostile, telling us the manager didn't have time to see us and we could stop by his office on our way out!! Needless to say this was a horrific way to escalate what was supposed to be a friendly, minor complaint in the first place.  We paid our bill and tipped the servers and dancers, despite having become completely aggravated by our hour-long wait to see the manager who may or may not have been one of the flustering people we talked to.  All in all, our night was ruined by their shockingly unprofessional conduct."}
{"text":"Shishlix is a good restaurant if you are looking for a healthier and halal Persian/ Mediterranean dining experience. This location is convenient located in the heart of Richmond Hill beside the Da Style Clothing Store. Here the meals consist of mainly kebabs and the portions are sizeable. The dishes are lighter and not as greasy as other restaurants offering the same cuisine.   Shishlix has a wide selection of moist and flavourful kebabs so you're bound to find one you like.  They are served on a bed of mixed white and yellow rice accompanied by a welcome charred tomato.  I have not tried any of the chicken dishes here but I would imagine they'd be on the same page as the kebabs. All entrées are served with salad, naan and the choice of rice or fries..or both for heavier eaters.   The décor is welcoming and the service is friendly. Although it is closer to the pricier side, I would still recommend this restaurant. If you're searching for the best kebabs in town, look no further than Lahore Tikka House. http://www.yelp.ca/biz/lahore-tikka-house-toronto#hrid:itbIrQAA-oAlqxiIicsdPQ  *ensure you secure red saffron spice mix for the rice *all meals are 100% halal  | 3.5\5 |"}
{"text":"The food had to be the most tasteless food.   The lamb shank was boilef  with a touch of yellow covering and had no taste.  The service was fair.   They wanted to charge $4 extra  to substitute one rice for another.   Serious ! Would I go back.   Never.   Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I only had 6 hours to spend in Toronto and asked my family to take me to a restaurant where I could have kabob as close to my favorite place in Iran as possible. When they pulled into a strip-mall, I thought they were kidding. What seemed like more of a joke turned into quite an elaborate feast though, and left me craving more!  First, we started with the traditional noon/paneer/sabzi combo along with mast-o-khiar and mast-o-moosir. They were your standard pre-meal palate pleasers, but nothing to call your relatives in Iran about. For my drink, I ordered doogh (carbonated yogurt soda) - which is absolutely my favorite Persian drink. Again, nothing special. At all. How dare you serve doogh on your menu, not make it drool worthy, and expect anything above 3 stars is beyond me.   But then came my entree and I knew my tummy was in big trouble. That bikini body I had worked so hard for was about to turn into a Homer Simpson beer belly with the amount of food they brought out. First, my eyes indulged in a huge platter of buttery rice, to which I added a raw egg yolk (don't freak out, everyone in Iran does it, and according to my medical sources, is absolutely safe). Surrounding the rice was one skewer of juicy, tender, grilled chicken and on the other side, kabob-barg so moist I still to this day don't have words to describe it.   Much to my own dismay, I devoured the entire plate like I had never seen food in my entire life and I can't wait to go back to Toronto, even if it is just for a trip to Shishlix."}
{"text":"I'd like the place with simple but fancy decoration . However, the food was below the average persian restaurant."}
{"text":"Im currently extremely irritated right now .. so im gonna get straight to the point.   The KEBAB TASTES GREAT. Beautiful.Thats no question, but ridiculous and cheap people who run the place clearly.  Our salon ordered 4 orders or koobideh, lamb kabab, lamb shank & hummus.   We were expecting each order in its own container.  Nope. Im assuming theyre trying to save on theyre plastic containers ? So they decided to mix all the kabab in one big container, & all the rice in another big container .  So everyones food is mixed, & others were touching my food. NOT IMPRESSED.  Who asked you to mix all our food?   IN ADDITION,  doing this, you would need to put plastic plates and spoons and forks for each portion... NOPE?  Nothing.  Should i eat this with my hands????!   So i call in, the man says it doesnt regularly come with plates , and spoons and forks would have to be 'requested'  .....   So $150 worth of food ordered and you cant spare plastic spoons for us to eat with?  Absolutely Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Excellent Persian food. The kebabs are cooked to perfection. I had the veal atew which was delicious and the meat was very tender. Huge pprtions too!"}
{"text":"Time to update my review, and they've taken the effort to do a mad update to their restuarant!  It looks a lot better now when you walk in, totally more modernized and chic.   The prices have gone up though, and do not match the ones listed on the website.  We ordered (take out) two koobidehs, one with fries and one with rice.  The koobideh was pretty standard fare, though I did feel it was a bit bland.   The fries were so nasty again. Why did I order them?   The rice was phenom, and one portion was enough that me and my mom split it, and there was left overs the next day. WHAT.   The salad was okay. Though, one thing I have to point out is the container. IT WAS SO HARD TO OPEN.  2.75 stars, so Im bumping it to three.  I'll probs be back here cuz my mom loves it. Maybe next time we'll eat in cuz its so pretty."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for Iranian food for years. It's delicious and fresh. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 I've tried to quite a few of Persian restaurants and I always go for the kabobs koobideh and chicken leg kebab this one I can say is the best I like so far it is nice and juicy I love the rice I love the big portions great service I also like the naan bread very chewy and  couldn't get enough of it especially when you order the dip tray which has hummus and eggplant two ways from northern Iran and Southern Iran the two different types of traditional eggplant dip very good and the yogurts  definitely recommend this place if you want some Persian kebabs that are delicious the other stuff looks delicious  my friend had the lamb shank and the lamb chops all look great I will try again next time"}
{"text":"good food horrible service no offence but that's kinda what you get with most of the Persian restaurants around. The live music is pretty good and keeps you entertained while ur server isn't paying attention to u but if u come on a night without the live music, you'll definitely get a glimpse of the bad service. Kabob torsh is by far my favourite dish here alongside Barg"}
{"text":"I and a business friend from Japon went to the Shishlix Persian restaurant in Richmond Hill, Ontario and ordered Bagali polo with fish, Cornish chicken BBQ and a lamb BBQ which served with fresh hot bread. The food all were very fresh and tasteful that II ever had in Toronto area.   I used to go to Persian restaurants like Zafaron and North before. But l will return to this restaurant in the future even with friends. Ms, Dorna who gave us the service was very polite, friendly and helpful with a  great manner,excellent smile.  All the best and keep up with the great service."}
{"text":"came here for a quick bite, ordered the koobideh kebab and chicken fillet kebab, both with rice. It was delicious. I've never been here for the nights where there is dancing and singing that others have mentioned, but the food is so good, that you don't need the extras to love this place. Still loving it."}
{"text":"By far the worst service from the owner. We were a group of 13 and he said I don't have enough room. Feel free to go. Though he serviced other people who spoke his language, with a similar group size. With so many options in Richmond Hill, never ever coming here again.  And it's over priced. Wish I could give less than one star."}
{"text":"The thing about places like this is: the food is OK. You can get better food elsewhere, but the decor and service were top notch. Definitely, a decent place to bring a difficult date (the kind you can't be yourself around), or host a dinner for your boss or friends from out of town. But if you're in the mood for the best Persian food in Richmond Hill, this is not it. Hit up Shater Abbas for the juiciest kebabs, or Pardis at 16th for the fluffiest rice and best-seasoned juicy chicken."}
{"text":"This is our first Iranian meal ever.  We told the waitress we knew nothing about Iranian food and were just being adventurous.  She responded with outstanding recommendations and attentive services to ensure that we enjoyed the food and the experience.  The waitress explained to us that Shishilx's most loved item was ground beef kebob.  Since there were two of us, she recommended us to order a Royal Dinner for 2 that came with ground beef kebob, veal tenderloin kebob and grilled chicken kebob, so we got to try many things.  We gladly complied.  All the kebob was fully marinated.  Layers of flavours were infused deep in the meat.  So much tender meat and nothing was too oily or fatty.  For meat lovers, this is meat heaven.  For sides, we opted for balsamic rice.  I didn't know balsamic rice could be so soft.  I asked our waitress how they made the rice so soft.  She said it was a long process that included multiples steps.  Sorry, I can't reveal the recipe here, but I am so trying it at home.  Last but not least, the portion was big.  We packed half the meal home.  We have the distinct feeling that Shishlix is an authentic Iranian restaurant.  Because other the waitress and the floor manager, I didn't hear anyone else speaking in English during the whole evening.  There was a DJ and a singer on stage providing live entertainment.  They spoke and sang in Iranian? Persian? I don't know; just not English.  And all other customers seemed to understand what they said.    I think I am lucky to have experienced an authentic Iranian meal, with live Iranian music and dancing, right in Richmond Hill.  How I love the multiculturalism of Canada!"}
{"text":"Visiting this place all the time. Best kebab in Richmond hill, lamb kebab is amazing. Owner and personnel are very polite. Did not have any single issue with. Place looks great after renovation, completely changed everything. Baba ghanoush is very tasty. Do not hesitate to visit this place."}
{"text":"I had eaten here twice. The food is good hence why people bother to come here at all, but the attitude and service of the restaurant manager is shocking. The second time I was here, it was for a private event. Our whole table got their food two hours late. Some guests left without being fed at all because the service was so slow! We had paid for sodas which no one had received until after most guests had already left. There was only 3 waitresses for a fully booked event, and it was obvious they couldn't take the extra tables. But what really threw me off is that the restaurant owner incited a fight with a guest over a chair. He was cussing and yelling at the families where there was kids listening. Food was even thrown! Practically ruined the positive happy occasion we tried to have.   On another note, the owner invited his friends and seated them in our private event, without consulting us! They were even fed before some of us who were waiting two hours for food!!!! How unprofessional is that? Never book your private events here! Don't support a business who doesn't value his customers. They won't be getting a dime from us again."}
{"text":"Persian restaurant in a shopping plaza.  The front window has a spinning wheel which give a rather strange outward impression.  Decor inside is bright and fairly nondescript.  The menu is pretty much a standard Persian one, emphasizing kebabs with the usual fessanjan and stews.  Curiously, they also had butter chicken, which one of our party ordered and which was very good.  I had a chicken breast / ground beef combo. I found the kebabs tasty but a bit bland in seasoning.  The order came with rice and a good sized salad.  We also ordered what was listed on the menu as \"baba ghanouj\" but per the description was yoghurt and eggplant salad with no tahini involved.  It was very tasty and the eggplant was properly smoky.  The flatbread - a sort of naan, was hot and excellent, but refills are $1.50 even if you order a spread type appetizer.  We were not interested in dessert but they had baklava and something else.  Service was gracious and pleasant, albeit a bit absent-minded."}
{"text":"The food is decent. Nothing really special to stand out. If you like kabob and happen to be around, it won't be a bad choice."}
{"text":"It is my favourite kebab house in GTA. Tasty Iranian food, high quality, a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Shishlix and it was quite good and quite expensive. The food was sumptuous. The rice was fragrant and fluffy. The Sultani kabob's barg and koobideh were perfectly juicy, tender and delicious. The tomato was grilled to perfection as well and went well with the rice. I did not have the chicken kabob, but it won much praise from my friend. The complimentary bread at the start was warm and tasty and went well with butter. They did not serve vegetables and other accompaniments I have seen at Iranian restaurants. That was disappointing as their prices are high. They do have stews for less than $20, but several dishes are almost $40 each! Those prices are so high that one would consider going to Persia next to No Frills at Yonge And 16th for a little less quality at half the price instead. However, the quality and quantity was above average and neither of us could actually finish our food. This is an Iranian restaurant, but for some reason the menu also offered Butter Chicken (Indian) and hummus (Arabic) as well.  The waitresses were polite and the food arrived quickly and was cleared promptly as well.  The dining area is very clean, which is mandatory, and well-designed. There was a small stage and musical instruments in one corner indicating that they have music on certain days or occasions. The ambiance was not as high-end as Persian Palace, but Shishlix is an above average dining room regardless. I would turn down the music however. It is too loud and hampers conversation.  A lot of delicious food in a nice atmosphere at a high price."}
{"text":"Hit and miss. This is for the service and the food. One day both are excellent: food is tasty and the service is prompt and friendly. Another day the meat is dry and overcooked, the waiter looks like he just came from the funerals. We went there 3 or 4 times, probably wouldn't go anymore."}
