{"text":"I had a great Donair for a reasonable price and I will be returning in the future as a patron.  I'm a die hard Jimmy's A and A customer and have been for years - Aladdin is now my close second choice and would be number one if I lived closer to there than to Jimmy's ."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here. Had the butter chicken and donair pizza- which was fantastic!! So fresh, great portions at an affordable price. Only complaint was in how long it took to be delivered, well worth the wait though and was still hot on arrival. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered 1 pizza. 3 donairs and cheezy bread at my buds in Calgary. Very good Donairs!! The lamb one was stellar! Pizza was perfect and tasty. The cheese bread was more cheese than bread and taste superb! I know where Im ordering next time I visit! Good job Aladdins!"}
{"text":"This is right between my office and my house, so sooner or later, I was bound to wind up in here (I held out two whole weeks, I'm so proud of myself!).

Anyways, couldn't stand the idea of frozen pierogies for lunch AGAIN, so I ran over here today. I was in a rush, so I decided to go the fastest route and grab a slice of pizza from the types that were on display.

The staff was polite, the place was clean, and less than 2 minutes and $3 (including tax!) later, I was on my way back to the office.

During the walk, the food cooled down quiet a bit (so maybe wasn't that hot to start?), but I doubt it did anything to the taste - unless it influenced it positively?

This is a heck of a good deal for $3! It's got a great ratio of cheese (tons, yay!) to meat to pineapple to sauce to crust. The crust is nice & crisp, although the slice was maybe a bit too big for the strength of the dough - I had to eat it with a knife & fork because the end was too limp from the weight of the toppings. The sauce was a bit more spicy than I usually like, but was otherwise good.

In short: good service, good food, super-convient & terrific price.

I think I'll be back in there trying out the Sharwma wraps very soon!"}

Donair was so sloppy I could barely hold it without it falling apart"}
{"text":"Great pizza when your looking for a change from the usual. Donair pizza is excellent if you want to try something different."}
{"text":"Aladdin Donair and pizza serves food that tastes good enough. Although what it appears to suffer from is a complete lack of disregard for consistency in the size of pita you pay for. I ordered large pitas and paid nearly $4 extra for each of them. When the order arrived and I took it upstairs. I found out that the proportions were noticeably smaller than the last several times that I had ordered their large pitas. I called SKD to request a reimburesment only of the additional charge to make them large sized. What I got was the a man calling me and arguing with me about the alleged dimensions of the pitas. Blatantly disregarding that in the past it was actually always larger. Completely refused to give back the extra money I spent on nothing. I will no longer be supporting them."}
{"text":"So disappointing...
Even my hubby who is not a picky eater does not give it a pass.
The shop itself was large, clean and the meat and toppings all looked fine. It was hot in there though, no air conditioning inside on on a hot day. Not uncommon I guess but would be too uncomfortable to eat inside.
The owner took a bit of time to come out from the back. He was quiet, not too talkative but friendly enough. He let us try the baklava on the house which was nice but it was not made in house.
We got 2 chicken shawarmas and drove down the road to eat at the park.
The chicken was dry and we had wished the meat had been cut off the rotating skewer and not from a side bin on the counter. The reason we chose the chicken in the first place is how good it looked on the stick. Is it ever polite to ask for fresh meat in this situation? The veg and sauces were ok.
The worst part is that both shawarmas fell apart almost instantly and it was a huge, gloppy mess for both of us. It was a good portion of food but was not wrapped as well as they do it at other places. 
A miss for us and we had high hopes as most of the reviews for here are good."}
{"text":"What a spic'n'span little Donair shiny shop!

They had me as soon as I walked through the door with the delicious smell of, well, wouldn't you guess it... Donairs and Pizza.

Fresh, crisp, flavourful ingredients, and a good balance of each. There are a lot of  similar donairs out there, but it takes some extra love and a lot of fine tuning to make one that stands apart. Well done, Aladdin!

Today, I switched it up and went with a slice of Donair Pizza.  It was... well it what I would expect for a $3 pizza by the slice, but really no more than that. The only thing that made it a \"Donair Pizza\" is it used donair meat instead of something else, and that was the only ingredient. Still tasty.. just not up there with the donairs.

The staff are really friendly, and you can tell they really care about their store and the food. It makes me happy to spend my money at their store."}
{"text":"I ordered from this business today, planning a movie night with my sons. We got the worst pizza I've ever bought from a restaurant. Additionally, it came 35 minutes AFTER it was supposed to arrive and wasn't even warm. The crust wasn't even cooked all the way. The pizza itself had nearly no flavour. Really, this was the most disappointing pizza experience my sons and I have had. Too bad I ordered an extra large! I really can't come up with anything good to say. Sorry Aladdin, I won't be rubbing your lamp again."}
{"text":"Props for this spanky new clean place.  

Gotta love the big screen 50 inch LCD menu screens, 2 of them!

Their vegetarian pizza was the bomb, fresh tomato, olive and green peppers.  gotta eat a bit healthier these days lol.  Nice, crispy crust."}
