{"text":"Food was OK, service could be better. Probably won't return here.   We were seated right away when we walked in and they have buttons to call a server over. We had to press the button twice before the first server showed up to take our order. After our order was placed it took a long time before the first dish arrived, they got the order wrong for the second dish.  When we corrected to server, she gave us a random dish off her cart and walked away. We called a different server and let her know about the mix up. We were waiting for over 30 minutes before calling a server over again, it turned out they forgot our second order, then we had to wait over 15 minutes for that to arrive. They didn't even apologize for making us wait or mixing up the orders.   The food we ordered arrived hot and it tasted OK. We ordered the Don KatSu Dupbap and Samsun Jajangmyon. There was nothing spectacular about the dishes so I don't think I will be returning, especially considering the service. The Don KatSu Dupbap was pretty simple, it was egg sauce and fried pork on rice. As for the Samsun Jajangmyon, it was mostly onion and it lakced a variaty of seafood. The only seafood in it was diffrent types of fish cakes."}
{"text":"Nak Won!! Food was not the best. I ordered bulgogi and it was super dry. Service on the other hand was TERRIBLE!! I have to press the service button 9262515391836 times to get their attention. They aren't really friendly either. The only thing that may have been decent were the cold appetizer dishes you get at the beginning. I rather go next door and eat at Minerva Owl!"}
{"text":"Used to come here quite a bit as it was the closest Korean restaurant to where I used to live.  I would agree with most of the reviews here, I've tasted better Korean food but there's nothing particularly bad about the food here either.    The place is not exactly clean but the service is decent.  One thing I should mention is that I ordered take out once and they messed up the order.  I lived approx 10 mins away.  Instead of me going back to get what I paid for someone actually came and delivered it to my house.  I thought that was pretty nice of them."}
{"text":"This place has a 2 star rating????  That's already overrated. We came here on a Saturday evening. Server sat us down and threw our place mat and utensils like ninja stars. A napkin nearly fell off. Oh and don't bother pressing the bell to get your server. It's not going to get their attention. We ordered a soon tofu,  LA kalbi, champong and japchae.  The soon tofu came UNSEASONED. It was literally water and chili oil. We told our server about how bland it is and asked for salt. She merely responded with a \"talk to the hand\"  motion and left. I went to another table to grab the condiments myself. We even had to throw in the kimchi side dish into the soup to remedy it. Next up, the kalbi was BURNT, to say the least. If you like charcoal bits with your meat then I tell you they serve it here. The champong noodle was overcooked, like it's earwax in soup. For the japchae, they used skimpy thin noodles, and the size is not what it's worth.  Unsatisfied with their service,  (they never even refilled our tea once) we only tipped them 2%, AS A COURTESY. When the server got the recipet she held us back and DEMANDED the 10%. In anger, we threw down the $5-of-never-coming-back. I don't write alot of reviews, but this place has pissed me off enough to do so."}
{"text":"Very expensive with little substance.  The lamb in the $15 lamb stew was so over boiled that what tiny amount of lamb they did use had almost entirely disintegrated. It was also really over-spiced."}
{"text":"Food is crap. Jajiangmien is salty,  pork bone soup has no pork flavor, glass noodles have no taste either. Service is a fine just the quality of food is lacking."}
{"text":"Yonge/Major Mack and Yonge/Finch are the two other locations I have tried in the past and was never disappointed.  I hate to do this but, the location at First Markham Place is not as good as the other two.  Arrived Friday evening and the place was about half full.  Service was not that bad but the food was a little disappointing.    Ordered the bbq beef sirloin and seafood pancake.  The beef was pretty soft and tender and it came with a choice of soup and two bowls of rice.  We decided on the kimchi soup which was very sour (not like the other locations).  We had some problems with the grill which the waitress failed to acknowledge. It was obvious that it was running out of gas and they did not bother to change it for us.  I guess it was partly my fault, they noticed how fast i was eating and how rare i was eating it as well. The pancake was a bit short on the seafood and too much green onions.   The beef was $29.99 and pancake was $12.99.  Bill came out to be about $48 and change for two.   Will I come back... unlikely.  I rather go out of my way to the other two locations.  I found it strange to see such a low rating for this place on Yelp... I now know why."}
{"text":"Agree with most of the people who had given the rating of 1 star. Regret for not yelping before going to the dinner last night.  If I could give negative 5 stars I would do it without a second thought. It was absolutely the worst customer service ever. Korean restaurants always provide lots of appetizers and refills when asked.  We asked for a refill for just 1 appetizer that we like for the 2nd time. At first we were ignored even though we pressed the bell at least twice. And then when a waiter came, we were given the response \"no you can only have 1 refill\" and some attitude as if we were begging. Mind you we had a table of 6 and ordered a dish each. It can easily win the worst Korean restaurant of all time if there was such a recognition. The price wasn't cheap either. I just wonder how they still manage to stay in business with servers who hated to work there and give attitudes to the customers as if we were causing troubles to them. All in all, we would not go back there again and would encourage everyone to stay away from there like a plague. There are tons of Korean restaurants around with great customer service and good price. Please do yourself a favour; take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The cold noodle is TERRIBLE. No flavour and all the noodles are stuck together. Bad experience"}
{"text":"One of the worse dining experience ever. If I could give -5 stars, I would.  My group of friends and I walked in and got seated after 10 minutes of standing there even though it was not busy since we saw many empty tables. Once we sat down, we sat there for roughly 10 minutes. Usually we would have been given tea by now but nothing. I started to press the bell, (even though we could hear the bell ringing nonstop - assuming other tables were also ringing at the same time) - no waitresses came over. After 15 minutes, I waved my hands in disbelief hoping someone would just come over and write our orders because we were starving. But no one - even though 2 ladies made eye contact with me. After 20 minutes, I saw one waitress coming by my table and I BEGGED  \" could you PLEASE write our orders\" - she rolled eyes at me and yelled out HOLD ON angrily. (seems like it wasn't her job to do so) After 7 more minutes, my group of friends and I just walked out. They didn't even notice and probably didn't care.  This is my third time coming to this place, and the previous times were just as bad. I thought I would give it a third try hoping it would be better - but it just got worse. I have never approached any restaurants that treat their customers like this, where the customers have to beg for service. I have no idea how this place is still opened today.    These old ladies that work inside this place have the nastiest attitudes ever. And I am not the only one complaining, clearly there are many others who have complained about their service on this page. In conclusion, I am never going to this place again. We went to another restaurant in the plaza and were actually treated like humans.  And If you want to have a bad day, just go to this place, it does wonders."}
{"text":"There's lots of side dishes here and the menu is big compared to the average Korean restaurant. Good is quite yummy as well. That's about where all the good stuff ends.   The service here is pretty bad. It's like pulling nails to get your cup refilled and since the food is salty or spicy, I really want to have some water with me at all times. My boyfriend asked two different waiters for a jug of water that never came.   I don't know why they have a bell at the tables for if they are going to just ignore the ring. My bf even Jones that we could have just got up and left since they're trying so hard to ignore their customers."}
{"text":"The food here is good for its value. The portions are of a decent size (enough to fill your stomach!) and the side dishes has some of the best variety i've seen in any korean restaurant. It used to be one of the places I go to when I craved korean food but the reason in my low rating is the service.  I have been here 4 times, each time with an open mind and a willingness to look past my previous visits. EACH and EVERY time I come here I am disappointed in their customer service. I have been given eye rolls, impatient sighs, avoidance, and slow service. I am by no means a person who needs quality service either! I am simplistic in that I just want my food served by someone who does not give me attitude when I ask for water or an extra spoon.   I am always willing to give this place another shot since I do love their food here. But I really hope they can change their attitude when it comes to their service. I understand that when things get busy people can become grumpy and tired, but please don't do it in front of a customer because that just seems very unprofessional to me."}
{"text":"Really disappointed... The spicy and sweet crispy chicken was sooo soggy... Like it was cooked five hours ago. Side dishes were not fresh and really dull looking... Service was alright... No smiles , just taking an order and seating... It was 70% dull on a Saturday night surpsingly... But I wont be back"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute worst service I had ever seen! The waitresses were rude and short-tempered the moment we walked into the door. Every time we tried to call one of them, they would tell us it was not their job to get stuff for us and we had to wait for our specific server. We seriously contemplated not giving any tips at all but we left the regular 10% and the waitresses had the gall to chase us out the door complaining and SWEARING AT US! What the hell kind of place is this?!  The food was average at best. There was a super irritating door bell going off every few minutes (it might have been the buzzers on the table, which was broken on ours). Overall, a horrendous experience. It would have been cheaper and tastier to go into the food court and order from the Korean food stall there instead of this sh*tty \"restaurant\". Save yourself from horrid waitstaff and DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"My Fav Korean BBQ AYCE. Meats are fresh and have authentic marinates. They may not have as much variety as other places but what they have is great quality and flavour."}
{"text":"Quick service with decent food and price. One of my favourite places for Korean food. They offer a number of complimentary appetizer dishes which you can get refills for, my favourite is the marinaded sweet potatoes. As per usual, I ordered the stone bibimbap which was very flavourful (~$9). You also have the option of getting korean bbq here and is a great option if you are with a bigger group of people.  As mentioned, the service is quick and the food arrives fairly quickly as well. The restaurant does fill up very quickly and as does the parking lot so I recommend arriving before main meal hours."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The staff was miserable and understaffed. I blame management for the terrible work environment then the actual servers.   The food was okay but it wasn't good enough to excuse the terrible service."}
{"text":"Good comfort korean food at a great price. I've noticed that they've been cutting back on the banchans that are served with your meal. Most of the waitresses are not very friendly though."}
{"text":"Going downhill from my last visit take out style.....ordered the tofu pork soup for my wife at home.....get it home and they decided to put the soup with tofu and pork in a clean plastic bag tied at the top, then they put that bag in a tall Styrofoam container with lid on and then they put that in another clear plastic bag tied at the top and then they put that in a take out plastic bag with a side of rice and Kim chi.   Why would my wife want her soup to taste like plastic bag and why is the soup packaged and treated like it was bio hazard material?  Big FAIL.  Lost my business for good and to the chef or food packer that packed soup like that isn't thinking or is over thinking something that is simple and has a tried and tested method from the decades of takeout places all over the world."}
{"text":"I never write reviews for restaurants, but I just felt compelled to for this particular Nak Won location because out of all the terrible restaurants I've been to (and I've been to plenty of bad ones), this tops the list and beyond. Where do I begin? Horrible service, less than mediocre food and by far the most rudest, disrespectful and miserable-looking bunch of sorry excuses for servers I've ever had the displeasure of meeting (who even swore at my friends and I).        After watching a movie at the Cineplex theater nearby, my friends and I were hungry and were looking for a restaurant that was still opened so we could grab a quick bite. It was almost 10:30PM and we saw Nak Won was still opened so we figured we'd might as well just eat there. As we walked in, we were seated to a table for 3 and given a menu. Not even 2 minutes into looking at the menu and deciding what to order were we bombarded by an older waitress who approached us and asked if we were ready to order. We said \"No, not yet.\" and she rudely told us it was \"last call\" and since the restaurant was going to close soon it meant we needed to decide now (even though we literally just picked up our menus). So we ordered on the spot and shortly after, were given the side dishes which were alright since they pretty much always taste the same (in my experience anyways), but as we were eating them, a younger waitress approached our table and reminded us that they're closing at 11:00PM (information already implied by the previous waitress). At this point, my friends and I didn't like how we felt like the waitresses were pressuring us to eat quick and get out just so they could get off work early when we still had a good half an hour left. Besides even if we didn't finish by 11:00PM we could've simply gotten our meals to go so we didn't understand what their problem was.   Our meals arrived, my friend and I ordered a fish katsu which was fried fish that includes rice, salad and soup. We did not receive the salad or soup, just the fried fish and rice and we only realized this mistake was made after we left unfortunately, otherwise they would've heard from us.  The fish katsu was less than mediocre and since I only had two things on my plate to judge (fried fish and rice), I mostly only tasted the outer fried part and very little actual fish, but the rice was normal I'll give them that (but then again it doesn't take a genius to cook rice in the first place). As we were eating, the previous younger waitress approached us again and asked if we could pay the bill now, we complied, but were pretty ticked off on the inside since we felt they were, yet again pressuring us to leave.   To be fair, the younger waitress was okay even though she reminded us that they were closing soon and gave us our separate bill early, she didn't  do it in a rude manner. So me and a friend tipped 5%, while the other tipped 10%, but later we regretted tipping them at all because as we were leaving two of the older Korean waitresses working there SWORE at us in Korean as we left. Basically they dropped the F word on us, said we took too long to eat (we only took about 30 mins) and how we tipped them too little even though we considered our tip to be pretty generous and more than enough than what they actually deserved considering how they insulted us and treated us like crap. Me and another friend are Chinese so we didn't understand anything they said, but my other friend who's Korean heard it and told us what those two waitresses said about us, but unfortunately she only told us after we left so we couldn't tell them off the moment they said it, but rest assured we're planning on calling the manager and reporting these two immature grown-up woman for their beyond rude and unacceptable behaviour soon. UPDATE: Called the place, asked to speak to the manager, but they claimed they had no manager so we just complained to whoever was on the phone, person on the phone didn't understand and had no clue what \"swore\" meant when we explained the story and didn't seem to care  TL;DR: Never going back to this place again (and neither should anyone else for that matter) even if I was paid to do so or on the brink of starvation because it's really not worth it unless you're willing to put up with their subpar Korean food, abysmal service and their horribly impolite Korean waitresses complaining and swearing at you in your very presence, then by all means go ahead, but for me I'd much rather take my business anywhere else than this pathetic attempt at a restaurant."}
{"text":"This particular location has totally gone downhill this year.  I went on a late Sunday night at around 9pm the last two times and the service was non-existent.    Why put a bell there if the servers don't even check the display board?  Took 15 minutes to flag down a server to order.  Gamjatang came but was way undercooked.  They missed our order of stewed beef broth so we had to wait 40 minutes.  When it came, there was no beef at all only the broth(They forgot to put the beef in....).  Took us another 15 minutes the flag down a server(the bell was useless).  I won't be coming to this location again for sure."}
{"text":"Please, don't ever eat here unless your a fan of bugs and hair. I've had bad experiences with them before but today just topped them all.   1. As usual the service was GARBAGE. The servers were so rude and just nonchalant about how they represented themselves.   2. The food was mediocre.    3. There was bugs and hair in our food!! The first dish we had we nearly ate a bug the size of my pinky finger. Their reaction? Oh, okay. No apology, no discount and no replacement of our dish. The second time we presented a live bug in our dish they didn't do a single thing. I found hair in my spicy rice cakes too and by then I juat didn't bother to notify them.   This place should be shut down. Its dirty,  the service is crap and they really harm the reputation of Korean restaurants.   I truly regret giving this restaurant a second chance.   Stick with Nak Won at Kennedy and Highway 7. They are the best!!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times but the service was consistently terrible!! The waitresses never smile and never say thank you, and sometimes they are rude. Very disappointed will never return."}
{"text":"I usually don't write review but this time I have to express my discontent about this restaurant.  I haven't been to this place for more than a year but I never thought it would become this bad. I ordered a bibimbap which costed $8.99.  It came out and only with three thin slices of beef which is hiding below the fried egg.  I usually don't complain but I can't help myself not saying anything this time.  So I talked to a waitress who was young and she wouldn't do anything about it.  She simply just shook her head.  So my friend helped me to ask a more senior waitress to come and I showed her the three thin slices of beef and she had a few embarrassing laughters and then took the rice bowl back. She came back with the rice bowl with more beef.  I didn't know if they had added any 'special' ingredients in this rice bowl but I did not care anymore.  And guess what, I will NEVER and I mean NEVER come back!"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night, 8:30pm. We had a party of 9. \"Well, there's your problem right there!\" you may say, but nay! We had our table in 5 minutes!  ...we had our order paper (with \"SEPARATE BILLS\" sprawled across the top) taken 35 minutes later, despite ringing the bell and flagging down waitresses a couple times.   ...our banchan (appetizers) arrived 45 minutes later. ...our party's first order arrived another 35 minutes later. ...our party's only order of dolsot bibimbap arrived 15 minutes after that.  Needless to say, we saw quite a few tables of 2-5 come in, eat (,pay) and leave before we even got our appetizers. This did not make any sense whatsoever.  One of our party members had to leave and was able to pay his portion of the bill separately. When we asked for the bill and reminded them we mentioned we wanted it separately, the waitress vehemently denied separate bills were possible.   And that was the straw which broke the camel's back... We retaliated with simmering complaints. Waitresses yelled at each other. The bill was separated. And after paying we did what we should have done at the 1.5 hour waiting-with-no-appetizers-food-or-attention mark: we finally left at 10:45pm.  As for the food, it was just OK. Never again."}
{"text":"The SO and I popped in here for lunch, primarily because of the banchan selection. Within moments I was wishing we had just stuck to Owl. (few doors down).   Lunch was HORRIBLE. The Banchan (there was a huge selection) were ok but nothing special. The kimchi looked like it had been sitting there a while. We ordered off the lunch menu, which promised a \"salad.\" The salad was literally 4 pieces of iceburg lettuce with a white dressing that was separating over the leaves.  My lunch was Chicken Bim bim Bap which was inedible. It was served cold in a white plastic bowl. The chicken was cooked maybe days earlier. The entire thing was slimy. The Korean man at table next to us also ordered  Bim Bim Bap and was presented a clay pot, piping hot.   The server was downright BITCHY. Not one thank you, not a smile. Looked PISSED when we asked for banchan refills (so I wouldn't starve) The SO had Gamjatang which was also unremarkable. Never came to check on us.  thankfully the bill was only $16 and the tea was good.   This place is awful. Owl is great, and two doors down with fantastic friendly service and house made kimchi. Go there."}
{"text":"If I can give NEGATIVE stars, I would not hesitate!  HORRIBLE SERVICE  -the server declined to give me an extra spoon. \" NO, YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE\" - that's exactly what she said to me in the rudest attitude possible. Seriously, I cannot understand why she would give us attitude for that.  -Korean restaurants are famous for multiple little appetisers. This restaurant would not let you get repeats of the little dishes. I understand that there should be a limit to the number of times one can get refills. BUT we only wanted a 2nd round. \" NO YOU CANNOT HAVE\" - that is what the server said again.   -I finally understand my they declined to give me a spoon when I saw what they did to wash their tea cups. I saw the server take some cups out of the dirty pile of dishes and wash it in a tub of water for less than 5secs and stacked them back up to serve to customers. DISGUSTING!!! I seriously want to report them to the Markham Health Inspection Board. (no wonder they don't want to give me a spoon, caz they don't want to wash it...sigh...)  I feel really sorry for the owner of the restaurant if that server was an employee.  If she's the owner, with that sort of attitude, I'm pretty sure she wont be in business for long  FOOD -nothing extraordinary about any of the taste. -chicken ginseng soup had absolutely no ginseng taste to it at all.  ATMOSPHERE -they serve krn barbeque at the table without any proper ventilation. The whole restaurant is filled with the smell of grilling pork fat.  OVERALL Please stay away from this restaurant if you don't want to be yelled at by the server."}
{"text":"I'm no Korean food expert, but I know what I like.  And I know when I've eaten better.  And at this particular location of Nak Won, I know I've eaten better.  Service was friendly, but very sparse.  There was one girl running the entire floor.  We felt bad for her, but we had to keep buzzing for service (each table is equipped with a buzzer).  She was really nice, but you could tell all the tables were getting pissed.  I ordered Sullang Tang (stewed beef in broth) and my companion ordered Seafood Dwenjang Chigae (seafood/veg/tofu in soy bean sauce broth).  The soups arrived lukewarm!  And the broth for both tasted very piggy, like pork entrails.  Almost like they didn't rinse the pig parts before dumping them into the broth pot.  We also shared a Tempura Shrimp Appetizer.  The shrimp were reused (or refried) and were small, shriveled and dry.  The vegetables were mostly potato slices.  The tempura coating was very greasy and not crispy/crunchy at all.  Very disappointing.         What saved the meal were the nine little containers of re-fillable banchan (appetizers/side dishes): honey potatoes, marinated soybeans, bean sprouts, fish cake, etc.  We mostly ate those.  But who wants to pay for a meal and only enjoy the free side dishes?  The mains were not worth it!"}
{"text":"What I look for in a Korean restaurant: - fresh side dishes  - side dishes refill  - friendly service; waitresses that speak Korean   This Nak Won location had none of the above.   Why I will never come back to this location:  - dokbokki (sweet & spicy rice cake) had no bulgogi (sweet beef) in it, while other locations (i.e. North York) had it  - I tried communicating to the waitress in Korean, which none of them speak -- that is a rule of thumb for how authentic this place is  - dishes drenched in MSG, literally had to drink a litre of water after the meal  - ordered manduguk (dumpling soup), which came with 4 dumplings with a large bowl of MSG soup    If you don't want to be disappointed, I advise you to visit the North York or Chinatown location instead."}
{"text":"After many failed attempts, finally managed to grab a group of friends to hit up the FMP location. This is a massive location and it is noted that its design is odd, there is a island for the staff to store dishes and the like in the centre. Useful, but it completely blocks the view of staff from the main counter when you first enter.     I ordered the bibimbap in the stone bowl, totally worth it as it adds that crispiness to the mixed contents that makes this dish one of my faves! I also am a huge fan of their banchan, then again I love banchans at all Korean restaurants. I am definitely biased for this =).   Would probably return if I am in the area though the north Korean town is probably more accessible."}
{"text":"Great korean food and get this, run by Korean people!  Great food on full menu.  Everything I've had has been just like home."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS.  Quite possibly my worst dining experience ever.  It was mid afternoon and we just happened to be in the area.  There are many restaurants in this mall, mostly Chinese and a few Korean.  We picked this one based on the menu but in retrospect we should have eaten Chinese.  We ordered: tuk kalbee which is supposed to be chicken thigh chunks, cabbage, duk (rice cake), carrots, perilla leaves and spicy sauce - all cooked in front of you at the table.  I have had this dish in Korea, Canada and at home, each time the formula remains the same with the odd variation from one place to the next.  Our table was fired up and then our plate of \"tuk kalbee\" arrived.  It was actually: pre-cooked chicken breast slices in a red sauce with green and red peppers.    Me in English: what is this? Is that pre-cooked ?Are we table cooking or table reheating? My wife immediately translates to Korean Server: that's how we do it here. Me: but this isn't tuk kalbee, this is pre-cooked chicken fajitas that we are now cooking again on a hot plate. Server: we tell the manager that but he doesn't listen.  The apathy from the staff was as infuriating as the food.  They did not apologize or offer something else. Here's your crappy food, ring us when you want the bill.  They saw zero tip, something I have never done before.    Just an awful experience."}
{"text":"Summary: Dirty and Bad Service  I have been to this restaurant a few times but tonight, for sure, was the last time for me and my friends.  To start off, the appetizer they served was very dirty, it had a bug in the food.  And when we asked the waiters for bowls, they gave us dirty bowls (with kimchi sauce on it, for sure they didn't wash them thoroughly).  At when we finished our meal, the waitress immediately handed us the bill (which we didn't even ask for it).  We paid the bill and tipped them well, and my friends and I would like to sit there for 5-10 mins just to finish up our tea and wait for our rides.  However, right after they got our money, the waitress asked us to leave because they have other customers waiting.  We told the waitress that we want to sit there for another 5-10 mins cause we need to wait for our rides, then she walked away looking upset.  After another 1-2 mins, another waiter came to our table and asked us to leave again.  My friends and I were very upset at that point because we already told the other waitress we just need another 5-10 mins, we didn't expect them to be so rude and came to ask us to leave again.  And at the same, another waiter also came to our table and asked us to leave.  My friends and I feel extremely offended and we left the restaurant right away.   Don't go to this restaurant, they don't deserve to get any customers."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve any star but I had to put something down to write a review. It was a blood boiling experience having to deal with  grumpy servers there. I have been to the Yonge and Finch location and found the experience ok. Maybe they decided to send the moody staffs to the FMP location.  I was there with my friends and their parents for a gathering. We decided on this location since the food (from other Nak Wons) were decent. I don't remember much about the food because I was too consumed by my growing rage. The servers are perhaps on a competition to piss off their customers because they were excelling at that from start to finish. I sensed the hostility at the time of ordering the food because of a very grumpy tone and face. When we asked for another round of side dishes my friends parents were nice enough to stack the side dish plates for the servers since we are running out of place. We thought it would be easier for them to take it away. Instead of just doing their job they nagged at us for doing that and said \"how am I suppose to reuse these plates\" implying questionable sanitary practices. I was holding back since I had to keep my calm in front of my friends parents buy everyone felt the negativity. They were lucky that the parents still decide to tip them since we know what curtesy means.   There are a lot of choices to eat within FMP and clearly these people don't want your business. Skip this one next time you choose a place to eat over there."}
{"text":"Today I am really pissed at myself.  Because I agreed to give this restaurant a second chance.  And they did it again.  The servers there obviously don't want to serve their customers.  They absolutely tried their best to avoid eye contact.  It was like that during my last visit three months ago.  Today for ten minutes we sat there without water or menu or even a simple greeting.  And this time I decided to cut my loss and walk out."}
{"text":"Nak Won is one of my favourite Korean restaurants in Toronto. Great prices, huge portions, and delicious food! They serve more traditional Korean dishes and KBBQ. Recently they've had a menu change where there are many new options. The service is also pretty good.  All the food comes with side dishes; the more people, the more variety. My personal favourites are the potatoes, jap chae, fish cakes, and preserved carrots/radish. THEY ARE ALSO UNLIMITED REFILL!!   The family BBQ combos are always more than enough for the number of people intended for. For example, for a combo for 2, you can pick 2 meats, an appetizer, a dish, a soup, and a rice. For more people, you would get to pick more meats. The meat is marinated very well and sometimes the waiters help you to cook the meat. We can never finish these combos even if we have 1 or 2 more people!  The budae jungol is pretty much hotpot for two people with ramen, sausages, pork, luncheon meat, veggies, rice cake, macaroni, and lots more!!   Their pork bone soup always have at least 3 or 4 pieces of bone!   4/5 stars because I think they could definitely do some renovation and change of furniture. A lot of the tables are wobbly and could be very dangerous for serving hotpot/BBQ."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS.   Be prepared to receive the worst service ever. Waitresses carry a really bad attitude. They are impatient and incompetent, not to mention super SLOW. The problem might be that this restaurant needs to hire more wait staff, but there is no way a customer will feel appreciated here with this type of service.  We were seated rather quickly, but took 15 minutes to flag down someone to just take our orders. Most astounding of all, was when the food arrived. The waitress stood beside my seat, expecting me to move over and complained that the dish was \"Too heavy\" so she must place the plate right between me and my boyfriend. We thought, okay fine.. maybe it was too heavy, but dishes after dishes arrived where they just hand it over to you, or place it right beside your utensils, not bothering to move or re-arrange the dishes in the middle of the table. The waitress was also very rude when I couldn't take the dish since I was in the middle of eating.   I have to point out that the RINGER at your table is pointless. No matter how many times we rang our bell, nobody came to our table. We had to wait almost 20 minutes to get our bill, and that was because we were just going to stand up and leave.   The food is pretty standard . You can get much better service at Est West (also in the same plaza) and better Korean food.   All in all, this place is a failure."}
{"text":"The worst Nakwon I have been to out of all their chains compared to North York and the one at First Markham. The place is not very well kept and customer service is very poor. Most definitely not a joint I would visit if given a choice. :/"}
{"text":"Went to Nak Won with my friends last night and we thought we'd get something pretty good and I'm not saying it wasn't good, but some of the things lacked flavours. Pricing is pretty expensive for 3 people it was approximately $32 each as we also got the spicy rice cake. Getting charged an extra $5 for unfinished food seems unreasonable as you're not allowed to pack it up if you have extra. Wouldn't go back here for food, definitely felt like I wouldn't be able to eat again after this experience."}
{"text":"The price of product is so expensive nowadays that the $26 AYCE dinner option at Nak Won isn't wholly unreasonable.  It's not amazing quality, but I find it's also better than many other Korean AYCE/sushi-hybrid options in the area. With the AYCE, you also get one stew/soup per table, from which you can pick either tofu, pork bone, or kimchi.  There's regular, a la carte dishes too.  Nak Won serves OK/standard fare stuff, with OK service (save for the one lady that was particularly nice).  Meh."}
{"text":"Just came back from here.   I was really close to giving this place two stars just because of the service, but it was the food that gave itself a little star push!   I ordered the galbi ribs, as its usually a routine for me when I go to any new Korean restaurant. I would rate it as the second best galbi ribs I've had, with Pmall's Axia Cafe still in first place. Ribs weren't fatty, I only had maybe one rib with a lot of fat.   My boyfriend ordered the pork bone soup, and according to him it was the best pork bone soup he's ever had! Even took a sip of the broth myself, and it wasn't half bad!  All the side dishes were amazing. It tasted and even looked fresh!  But let's talk about what caused me to take off two stars on this review.   The service.   Holy moley, it was BAD. Every table comes with this little 'Service Button' that's supposed to call a waitress to your table. But believe me, you can keep pushing that little button but nothing will happen. You have a better chance of discovering Narnia. Makes you ask, \" What's even the point of this button?!\" Though I'm just going to assume they are under staffed?   They've got some great table top BBQ/Soup options for two, at a decently fair price. I personally wanted to try the pork belly table top BBQ, but couldn't break my galbi streak.   If this place improved their service, this would be a really nice place to eat!"}
{"text":"Food has been very mediocre as of late. Soon tofu isn't even up to par. Side dishes were ill prepared, the flavour just wasn't there, I could have probably skipped the side dishes if I knew before hand. I would rather eat at the food court next time for Korean food too.   Service is okay, but what really ruined the experience and the reputation it once had (or never had since the finch and yonge nakwon was hands down always better) was when I got the bill.   It came to about $23.70. I only had $5 and $20 bills. I was going to wait for my grandma to see if she had change, since she usually carries a coin purse. I placed $25 into the tray and waited for my grandma. One of the waitress walked over and pointed to my bill saying only one thirty, look only one thirty. Basically saying that I wasn't paying enough tip. Who does that... It's called tip for a reason, not a forced price."}
{"text":"Cheap, cheap, cheap. My mom and I came here for a quick lunch and our total bill came out to $20 including tip. I ordered a brothy soup dish with beef and potato noodles (slightly spicy) for $8 and change, and my mom ordered the usual Bimbimbap (also for $8 and change). And of course for appetizers, we got all the small dishes of Kimchi, Noodles, Bean Sprouts, Potato, Vegetable, etc... Oh, and my dish came with a bowl of rice.   Needless to say, this was one of the best value, and tastiest, lunches I had at First Markham place.   In reading other reviews, there seems to be off days with the service. Our lady was friendly enough, and we rang the bell to get more tea - no problem.   I highly recommend this place for a fast, quick, cheap, and tasty meal that is absolutely satisfying. Because of the price point, I would highly recommend this place for large groups as well."}
{"text":"Don't come here for dinner on the weekends.  The restaurant looks large on the outside but they are severely understaffed inside.  Waited over 15 mins just to get tea and cutlery on the table and had to spam the bell they have on the table multiple times in order to get service.  Staff is not very pleasant, possibly because they are stressed out. You can get more authentic Korean food elsewhere, we only came here because Tofu House was closed that day."}
{"text":"smelly restaurant, mediocore food with extremely bad service.   first visit, they took ages to give us water and utensils for our food. we had to ask 2 different waitresses and they both said \"1 minute\" and never returned. second visit, the waitresses give us the same shitty treatment and this time i gave minimum tip(was strongly thinking of giving none), and the cashier gave me the dirtiest look. I'm not sorry for tipping you minimum.. at least i tipped you.   both times we went during lunch time there weren't even much people in the restaurant. all in all, i would give this place no stars if i could."}
{"text":"The positive reviews for this place are absolutely astounding.  I came here with a large party of people on a Sunday night. Something that, you would think, huge restaurants like Nak Won would be used to by now. They also fool you into thinking they have some sort of logical system of serving, with the electronic bells on the tables that I love. Yes, you can press them to your heart's content and even see your table number flashing on the giant LOST-like screen at the counter but your beeps will fall on deaf ears.... not once did the servers look up at the screen or even register that a bell was being pushed. Handwaving, dirty looks and even standing up to gesture to a server was to no avail.   Aside from Magic Wok, who I would say share the dubious distinction of SLOWEST AND MOST INCOMPETENT WAIT STAFF IN MAKRHAM (C), Nak Won is the worst place in the universe to eat if you want to be treated like a normal, paying customer (and/or human being).  It took literally 15 minutes to flag down a server to get a menu; another 15 to get them back in order to give them our order; 45 minutes to get our food; various sprinklings of 10-15 minutes in order to refill banchan (the side dishes) or get water, or a drink, etc,; and we actually waited so long for them to bring our cheque that I decided to bring it up to the counter to save everyone involved some misery. They seemed neither surprised nor repentent that their service was so shambolic that I had to do their work for them. The true mark of a horrible restaurant.   You might think this hyperbole, but really, what else are you going to a certain restaurant for other than being served well? All the Korean food available here can be found elsewhere for the same price and same or better quality. To think that there are still restaurant owners who don't understand the value of good customer service is beyond me.  Oh yeah, the food itself was nothing to write home about. The kalbi was overly-chewy, the kamjatang was watery and merely dosed over with spice, and so on. Amazing Korean food you will not find here.  It's a shame the Shanghainese restaurant that used to occupy this space is now gone because they had a good thing going. I cannot wait until Nak Won shuts down and shoves off to the Elephant Graveyard."}
{"text":"Not even worth 1 star! After 6 months not visiting this place, tonight just give them a second chance and guess what, even worse. First start with the same ill-manner waitress that didn't even bother to serve you. Then while we were checking out the menu, the table next to us was eating the just arrived pork bone soup and she paused..... She then dug out a black \"6-legged\" mini bug which had antenna that was long enough for her to hold up with her fingers. WHAT THE HECK!!!! Guess how they dealt with the situation..... The waitress just took away the soup, said sorry and gave them 2 cans of pop.   We debated a while to see if we still wanted to eat at this place and decided to try our luck. Guess what, they had a bell to call for service and we pressed it once.... No one came but they kept on passing our table. Pressed it again and no response. Pressed the third time and we decided we had enough! The waitress came by and told us not to press the bell so many time as they knew we pressed. I had enough and walk out of this place! Seriously, not recommended to go to thus restaurant unless you want to test your limit!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever, I am happy all the yelpers agree with me on this one.  I do not even know why they bother putting a buzzer at each table when they do not even respond to it.  It literally takes 20 mins to flag down a server.  You can clearly see they do not enjoy their job as they have a frown on their face and they are not friendly at.  My friend wanted to ask about some items on the menu and they were so rude to him. Might be the lack of staff and the management is to blame.  Been here more than 5 times cause my friend like their food.  The food here isn't bad as I have most of the dishes from Katsu to Kam Jam Tang.  I think I rather go to  Owl which is liteally 2 stores away but that place is small and cannot fit the group I was with."}
{"text":"This place is the worst restaurant I've ever been to.  we went at a time that was not busy and there were Like only two tables there and it still took them forever to serve us and get our food. the longest wait ever. food was mediocre. we had no water and the waitress kept on ignoring our bell rings and told us to wait when we finally caught her eyes attention. She never did come over though dispite more rings and handwaves. Felt like they purposely ignore us the whole time. we will never go back ever."}
{"text":"It gets a bad rep as a Korean place. I think prices are reasonable and fairly good tofu stews and bulgogi."}
{"text":"Location/Service On the corner slot of First Markham Place, near the Home Depot side. They have a pretty big sign outside, so it's not hard to miss. Plenty of parking available in the mall - and also parking available across the street. Not much interesting interior layout, but the tables were very spacious and suitable for large groups. Service was fine for me (compared to other reviews) - the staff was quick with our requests, proactively changed our BBQ plate, they weren't rude and also allowed refill of our banchan appetizers - perhaps it's a hit or miss for some.  Food I came here with a group of 8 people, so we ordered a variety of dishes to share. Sorry I forgot to take pictures - but some of the dishes include: Korean BBQ Ribs + Chicken + Pork + Bulogogi, Pork Bone Soup, Fried Dumplings, Army Stew, Pork Cutlet and Ox Bone Soup. Sounds a lot - but it was not overloading. And prices come to around $22/person, which I think is pretty decent for dinner.  Everything we ordered had a good portion size, especially the army stew. Quality wise is a-okay, nothing too mediocre or outstandingly good. It did give a comforting feeling to it, so sort of like eating a decent home-cooked meal. I particularly did enjoy the Ox Bone Soup - where it's a little sweet and the meat falls off instantly . The army stew was loaded with ingredients (ramen, rick cake, macaroni, tofu, kimchi, mushroom). The meat were marinated well and complimented well with the lettuce provided and rice.  Overall I think Nak Won still has it there. I don't find it particularly bad as what other reviewers have said, but wouldn't be a frequent go-er. It's nice if you want a nice quick meal or a KBBQ session with a few friends. Do note that their ventilation is not the greatest - you come out smelling like KBBQ."}
{"text":"Out of the two nak wons I frequent, this and the one at yonge and finch, this is the one that constantly disappoints me. Their food is ALRIGHT, nothing special. The recipes may be the same but they still taste a bit different and don't come with the wow factor.  Atmosphere is quiet as most of the time there aren't many customers. The place is huge so doesn't fill up most of the time.   Service is terrible. Pressing the button does not work and sometimes trying to wave a server down seems impossible. Very inattentive. Its like they don't even care if they get business or not.  Food isn't terrible, just alright. I only go here if I'm craving Korean food nearby and don't feel like going to owl."}
{"text":"This place is terrible and disgusting! They have a roach infestation! never never go here!"}
{"text":"NEVER COMING BACK.   Horrible service. The male server has zero expression. Ordered the kalbijim hoping for a hearty stew. It came out as a thick sweet stew with just 4 rib bones. Picture one strip of LA kalbi in total.   When asked for more side dishes, he looked at me with no acknowledgment then walked over and told me to finish the cucumber before he refill it. He then comes back with them minus the kimchi.   REALLY?! BAD SERVICE AND YOU CANT EVEN FOLLOW ORDERS.   I had to ask him for the kimchi. He again looked at me, muttered something and went off doing other stuff. 5 min later he comes back with the kimchi.   What a joke of a restaurant. Please don't employ people who doesn't even want to work here."}
{"text":"It's a common misconception that all Asian food is inexpensive when it is really only Chinese food that fits that description.  Nak Won's prices are what you would expect for Korean food: reasonable, but not cheap.  We visited on a Saturday afternoon and while not packed, it was busy and we were seated immediately.  Though the menu did say that the bubbling hot tofu came with a choice of seafood or pork, after I received the tofu with pork I realized that I had forgotten to tell, and was not asked, whether I wanted the seafood or pork.  *shrug* I was able to ask for an adjustment to a non-spicy broth which I appreciated.  It was quite yummy and healthy tasting.  The were 7/8 dishes bonus mini-dishes before the meal that definitely helped to salve off my starvation that afternoon.  Thank you Nak Won!  I would come here again when I'm looking for a non-crowded and delicious alternative to Chinese food when I'm in the First Markham area."}
{"text":"I used to go to Kennedy Hwy 7 location..great food and great service.  But this location,  the people are totally not friendly, they should learn and take a course how to smile to customers. It make us upset being served by people who can't smile. Please consider a better customer service."}
{"text":"Food was so-so. We ordered the all you can eat BBQ, we kept asking them to bring our 2nd round of food, it took them over 30 minutes to bring 2 plates of raw kalbi. How long does it take to prepare raw food? The waitress definitely forgot about it, more than once. Needless to say our 2 hour was up and we didn't even have a 3rd round of food. We both paid over $56 + tax of food and at the end we didn't even get a chance to eat our worth.   Service was horrible, we tipped them with whatever the change came back with because got next-to-nothing service. At the end the waitress asked us to tip them 10% and when we didn't want to, she then said we need to respect her and made a scene in front of several other customers. Where was our, the customer's, respect? We left the place unhappy, and empty feeling."}
{"text":"Despite its flaws, I still always come back for decent Korean food at a reasonable rate. It tends to get busy especially considering it's in the First Markham Place plaza, but nonetheless service will always be slow. Typically the small side dishes will not be brought until the entrees come (so you don't fill up on them hahaha). I typically get the gamjatang with cabbage which usually comes with sufficient amounts of pork bone and cabbage, plus the standard bowl of rice. The soup is pretty flavourful with spices so no complaints there. When if comes to the potatoes and gnocchi, it's pretty hit or miss in terms of quantity. There's nothing special about any of the dishes, but they're  not terrible. Accommodating for bigger groups, but service and food quality are sure to not to please anyone in those large groups."}
{"text":"Not really sure what people expect for $7 - the food is quite good, and they give you refills of side dishes.  Yes I agree the service can be curt, but if the server is rolling her eyes at you, don't look.  Their pork bone soup is one of the better ones.  And this restaurant gives a lot of side dishes, which are quite good. They also have bento box specials weekdays for lunch, which are good value also."}
{"text":"Avoid if you want an enjoyable night.  ~~~~~  Went on a Saturday night. Party of 10 with reservation.   I showed up early and a lady just litterally points her finger vaguely to the back of the place. It's my first time there so I wandered as far as the washroom before back-tracking and peeking into rooms to see where this 'table for 10' is. Finally found it in a corner right before the hallway leading to the washroom. I awkwardly walk around the table once to make sure it's mine, and notice that they have the buttons to call someone to the table. Meanwhile, the same lady tosses a few menus on the table then promptly leaves. No tea, no water, no smile, nor paper to write our order. Meh, whatever, I'm in a mellow mood. Since I was early and the only one there, I take out my tablet and start playing on it so I wasnt able to hear all the ambient beeping. My friends soon arrive and we pour over the menus to see what we want. A few of us (me included) are thirsty now so I decided to stick my hand up to get the attention of the waitresses. I now notice the on-going beeping of the restaurant. It's the symphony of multiple tables requesting service. We decided (for now) to not press the button as it seems a bunch of tables are spamming it, and we didnt want any surprises in our food. Unfortunately, I chose a spot near the wall so I wasnt very effective calling the waitresses as they never did look in our direction. A friend near the aisle successfully got us tea from a waitress, but she only gave enough tea to fill 7 cups. It took some effort to get more tea. The symphony is still playing, but we're all ready to order so pressed the button once. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. All their waitresses walked by our table and none stopped. More waiting. And waiting. Eventually one came by and asked what we wanted. We said we're ready to order and she gave us a look and told us to write it on the paper...that was never given! Came back with paper and pencil and left. Getting service was quite a hassle, and it's been 30mins since my friends arrived (I got there early). We're quite irritated, but they seemed busy so we'll give them benefit of the doubt.  We waited around 8mins until the appetizers came. Yay! Who doesnt love Korean appetizers?! They're free, taste awesome, and can get refills!  While she unloaded the set of appetizers from the tray, we asked for another set cause we have 10 people. \"No, one set per table\". WHAA? We have 10 people though. \"No, one set\", then promptly leaves. Well, our Korean cuisine experience has just been crushed instantly. One set regardless of the amount of people. We should've just split into two tables... Table is bit more quiet now with people holding in their rants about the recent comments. We want more tea...well...that takes a lot more effort than one thinks in this restaurant. Fortunately, the food came a few minutes later that. With all the effort getting service, we just decided to eat. Food is very similar to other Korean places. Nothing great, nothing bad.  But you know, the appetizers are addictive so we wanted at least the potatoes to be refilled. So pressed the button to join in on the symphony. Wait. Waited. More waiting. Just press it again. Wait. Waiting. Wait. Another press should do it. More waiting. And waiting. Somehow, one came and we asked for more potatoes she said one set person, but we persisted it's only the potatoes we wanted. Unwillingly, she came back with 3 potatoes (on a dish that can fit 15 potatoes). Frustrated, we decided to just get the bill and leave. Well....more waiting unsurprisingly. No error with the bill and tips arent included fortunately.  We paid. No tips. Left.  Dessert at the HHH place in Times Square was much much more pleasant.  ~~~~~  PROs -ummm.....I didnt get mystery bugs in my food like other reviewers did?  CONs -bad service -terrible service -horrific service -did I mention service sucked?  MEH -Food isnt that different than other Korean places. The Tteok bokki I had had less sauce than other places, and also less rice cakes than other places. I also had Bulgogi, which is the same as all the other places.  OVERALL If all you want was food and dont care about service...I guess. But I'd rather have another cuisine or drive farther if I'm craving Korean food. It was a Saturday night, but they had 4 waitresses with ~15 tables. Even if they were too busy, they could simply said wait and avoid giving looks and attitude. Other reviewers went earlier this year and reported bad service then too. Too bad I didnt check Yelp before going. Avoid until their service improves."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and visit any other Korean restaurant at FMP. The only reason why you would come to this restaurant is if you're up for serving yourself. Though considering all stories about finding extra protein (a.k.a insects) in food, you might want to extend that reason to include self-cooking.   I came here the first time with a friend to have an early dinner. We sat ourselves down (because no server came to seat us) and proceeded to press the button to call for waiter. What a surprise - it was broken. Thinking we were extremely clever, we pressed the button on the unoccupied table next to us. What a surprise - no waiter came. After waving foolishly for fifteen minutes, a disgruntled women came and took our orders begrudgingly. We had to beg her to give us tea and side dishes. We both ordered gamgatang, but what came to our tables appeared to be spicy water with a heap of skimpy bones. Trying to mask the lack of taste, the chefs evidently overspiced it, which called for the need of multiple glasses of cold water. Another horrible surprise - the waiter never came to give us any even when we asked. Our tea ran out before our food came and it remained empty until we left. Our server looked as if she was ready to clobber the living daylights out of us when we paid in cash.   My second visit was much worse. No side dishes until we were halfway through our meal. When we pressed the button, the waiters retreated to the back of the restaurant and disappeared for a good twenty minutes. My friends soontofu looked like it had already made a journey to and back from the chef's own stomach.   Needless to say, I felt happy when I left no tips, or rather, a penny and a scathing note. In fact, I was elated."}
{"text":"Watched a cockroach climb out of my friend's meal. The waitress didn't seem to think it was a big deal and still charged us. I'll never be coming back nor will I recommend this place to anyone. My coworker went on a separate day and also saw a cockroach crawling at another table months before this happened. Too bad I wasn't told sooner or I wouldn't have came!"}

{"text":"Not sure if the other locations of Nak Won food quality is similar... but the quality is quite mediocre at this location.   I only choose to come to Nak Won over the other korean restaurants in the vicinity is because they have a large variety of korean food. They have a good variety of banchan compared to other restaurants and service was decent.   We had the pork bone soup and the marinated spicy pork bibimbap.  If I was just ordering pork bone soup, I would not come here but go to Owl of Minerva in the same plaza. The pork bone soup is not as flavourful as I am use to.  Their marinated spicy pork bibimbap was good. Would order again.  I probably will avoid ordering their soup-based items here and go for their other foods they have on their menu."}
{"text":"The GamJaTang was a pork bone soup with potatoes and vegetables and rice for just $7.99!  It was hot and bubbling when it arrived to the table.  The soup wasn't very spicy but it was oh-so-delicious!  I tried a bit of it too and loved how tender the pork was.  It fell off the bone and was incredibly tasty.  It was perfect for my mom who likes spicy foods."}
{"text":"Came here on opening day and it has not improved, whether it be service or food. What can I say about service? It totally sucks sometimes and decent the other times. The ladies here always seem to be on their period.. They speak with a rude tone and they do not look like they want to work. I do like the portion of their dishes, but their exceptionally disappointing service sets them back. The service today was better, but still sub par at best.  I stopped visiting couple years back. I ordered their gamjatang (pork bone soup) and the lady had repeated what i ordered. Everything was fine until she gave me the soon tofu soup. So I told her nicely that this isn't what I ordered. She insisted that I ordered that but both my gf and I heard her repeat my order. She got pissed and got my pork bone soup shortly. She literally dropped that thing on my table, splashing soup everywhere. I got up and processed to cuss this lady up and down but decided not to.. And instead complained to the owner and walked up to her face and told her \"you're not being tipped\".  Only came back because friend wanted Nak Won. I will continue to support Owl of Minerva or another authentic Korean eatery on Yonge."}
{"text":"I personally think this location is better than the one at FMP (first markham place). This one is smaller, but the staff are way better in terms of politeness and courtesy. Food seems to be the same -  taste and presentation. The pork bone soup has always been spicy, not like Owl. I like the spice though, blast of flavour!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3 Service-1 Food-3 Strikeouts-0/3  We ordered a 3 person KBBQ combo here, and it was a lot of food for essentially 5 people. However, it was a bit pricey, like at least $25 per person. The assortment of free appetizers that always comes with the korean food was a nice selection on the other hand. The combo not only came with meat, but a selection of other items our our choice. We got pork bone soup, a onion pancake, gyoza, and jajamen. I personally liked the jajamen, and the onion pancake.  The biggest flaw here though isn't the food. I would say it's very traditional korean food and the prices overall are fair for what you get. It's the service! Not the mannerism, or over attitude, BUT the amount of people working. This place is huge, and I've read review below and it confirms that this place lacks staff. Probably lacks staff in the kitchen also in addition to the service. It only had two people working on the outside, sometimes one. I had to go grab bowels, chopsticks, napkins, and whatever I needed from their reserve, because it was just that much faster.   Only go to this place during non-peak times, or else you're not going to get any service, even with the button they have at each table to call for service."}
{"text":"The side dishes that I like, fish cakes slice and the Korean Chap Chae or Jap Chae (glass noodles) were hard and dry. It doesn't taste good. In a normal Korean restaurant I will ask for the refill like 4 times but even the second time, I didn't want to eat it any more.  Moving on to the bulgogi, the meat was rough in texture and the marinade didn't taste good. I hate a few shrimps. That was it.  Because I didn't really like the marinade of the pork aswell. I was still hungry towards the end but didn't want to eat anything else from the all you can eat. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"I haven't been to any of the other Nak Won chains, but this one was a bit underwhelming. Had the bulgogi noodle soup and it was rather bland and disappointing :(. There's a lot of good food options in this area. Try something else!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I were craving for Korean food and we wanted to go some place near Richmond Hill (since we usually have Korean food in Koreatown)....when we arrived at First Markham Place, we were deciding on whether to go to Owl of Minerva or Nak Won...eventually we chose Nak Won only because it looked more 'decent' from the outside.  Anyway, as we entered, we were told where to sit and received our menus. After 20 minutes of realising that they won't be coming to take our order any time soon, although there weren't many customers, we decided to call for the waitress. After placing our order, the food arrived after a while. As she arrived with our food, my cousin & I were lost in a conversation when we were interrupted by an annoyed \"Hey!\" from the waitress requesting us to MAKE SPACE for the dishes....like seriously?! Are WE the ones that were supposed to 'clear' the table? As the food were set on the table, we had ordered DukBeoki, which wasn't HOT/WARM, and the side dishes were poorly prepared. From this moment, my cousin and I were furious and annoyed that we revieved cold DukBeoki AND that we had to clear the table for her. After eating our food, which wasn't all that great, we asked for the bill and one of us paid for it via credit card. We had decided not to leave a tip because of the incident as well as the SLOW service. As the waitress ripped the credit card receipt, she saw that we hadn't left a tip and said \"NO TIP?!\" She ripped the receipt from the machine, then folded it on the table and stood there...we were shocked by the way she placed the recipe on the table and stood there kept looking at us and asking \"no tip?\" My cousin refused to tip her, but in the end, I reluctantly decided to throw in less than 10% of the bill for her. Then, she snatched the change and walked away, without a simple \"Thank You\" that you would usually get for paying the bill.  I was hoping to return with my friends & family, but don't think I would ever return.   Summary: Food = 4.0/10 Price = a bit on the pricey side Service = very POOR"}
{"text":"So torn about this place. There are days where my favourite server is working and everything is great. She is happy to see me and knows exactly what I want and is quick about it. Other days, I get this older woman who doesn't seem to care about what she's doing and doesn't really care to fully understand your order.   When I get my favourite server, I get my usual, kimchi chiggae, promptly with all the banchans. Refills on the banchan as per request. She is so cheerful and pleasant and if she has time, she will teach you how to properly pronounce the dishes.  When I get the other lady, she doesn't get the order right or gives the wrong order to me and doesn't refill the banchans as I've asked, even though I stare at her while she walks by my table every time. I'm vehemently against pushing their call button because I'm positive the servers get nightmares about that sound, but I still would like to receive some kind of service. One time, my friend ordered the kimchi chiggae and asked for it extra spicy. This server handed me the extra spicy dish and I couldn't eat any of it. She took away a full bowl of stew and didn't care to ask if anything was wrong.   When food and service is good, everything is awesome. The kimchi chiggae is so tasty with just the right amount of spiciness to it. The rice is sticky and fragrant. And the price is right. Honestly, you can't go wrong with an $8 dinner!"}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 2 stars! Service was decent, one of the waitresses did crack a smile at the end of our meal. The pork bone soup has a slightly different taste than other typical restaurants. Maybe a different/stronger spice they used? Either way, we personally enjoyed it. Sides were plentiful and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the service was terrible. The food was passable (we got the bibimbap and gamjatang), but the appetizers were flavorless. The waitress who served us seemed like she didn't want to be there, and every time we needed something it was like we were interrupting their conversation. When we asked for the bill, she ignored us to finish her conversation, making us wait. Complete lack of customer service.   The most appalling part came after we paid the bill. I have no issue tipping, but it is something that is earned, not an entitlement. We felt our experience was poor and the tip reflected that. As we were leaving, the same waitress ran after us claiming we did not tip enough. When we started explaining why we didn't,  she walked away before we finished our sentence and said forget it.  If you're at First Markham, do yourself a favour and go to Owl of Minerva. The food and service is much better there."}
{"text":"there are not much choices for Korean Food up in Markham/Richmond Hill. I used to always go to the yonge/finch location for my gam ja tong fix. Nak Won is one of my Fav Korean restaurants, the prices are great, the service is FAST, the apps are delicious and unlimited refills, if your not way too full already, cause the portions they have here are pretty big. I always come of this place, way too full. It is a bit hard to find parking at FMP but there is always people leaving so just be patient."}
{"text":"Their service is always bad lol just like the Yonge and Finch location. For a quick meal it's alright if you can't think of what else to eat. Just don't expect anything that would wow you from here."}
{"text":"The deep fried pork chop cutlet taste amazing! It is deep fried and seasoned with a type of garlic mayo. I enjoyed eating every last bite. I also tried the pork bone soup which I found to be decent as well, more on the spicer side. The meal generally comes with side dishes like kimchi, beans, potatoes, glass noodles etc. I found those to be kind of old (not fresh). I also found the service lacks here hence giving it a 3 stars. If you want a quick bite, it's def a good place to try but don't expect high standards."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Pros: 1) Lots of seating. 2) They have buttons on the table you can press when you need service. 3) Refilled apps promptly. 4) Polite servers.  Cons: 1) Food was average, prices were average."}
{"text":"Very poor meat quality, not real Korean.  Nothing like Korean food.  The owner is Chinese.  Probably the worst Korean I have ever been... Stay away."}
{"text":"A lot of people I know aren't a big fan of Nak Won, but I actually find it a decent place to eat. Nak Won has been around for a long time and I've been coming here quite some times over the years - even more when the movie theatre was still located at First Markham Place.  When you come in, there are plenty of seats as this is a big restaurant - I never see this place completely empty, and they have large tables too, so it's good for large groups. They now have an all you can eat option as well as an order and dine in option (which I always go for).  I think they have a WIDE selection of banchan when you come here, which is always delicious and great. Whenever I come, I always get the pork bone soup, which comes in a stone pot and a metal bowl for the rice. If you ask if this is a tasty Korean restaurant, it might not be the best in the GTA area, but it's definitely an okay place to visit when you're deciding what you want to eat."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy weekend night to try their ganjatang. There was only 1 waitress present but the service was quick and served with a friendly attitude. The food was given in a generous portion and we couldn't finish all our share. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for friendly service combined with quality food."}
{"text":"This place was huge! I never had so much appetizer, I think they gave use about 10 different plates for 5 people. I didn't really have to much of it because it didn't look that great to me. (***)  I really wanted the tofu soup since the weather was so cold in Canada. Even though I was looking forward to it, it was nothing really special about it. The flavor was a bit bland and I would say weak. It's a bit water down and I thought it had some egg in it, but it didn't. The portion was decent size. It came in one of those black boiling bowl. (**)  Service was ok because there wasn't much people so it was easy to accommodate to my needs. Not that I really asked for anything. I honestly have to say I didn't think this was a Korean restaurant. If there wasn't any kimchi I thought this was a Chinese restaurant. Maybe it was just me. (**)"}
{"text":"please stay away from this restaurant: 1) Horrible service as if customer is a burden. Server was rude and unclear to where she'd sit us; she rolled her eyes at us and left us standing and guessing where our table was.  2) Waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order even though we pushed the server button. First thing she said when she came to our table: \"you didn't have to push the button...\"  3) Cleanliness of the kitchen is EXTREMELY questionable as customer found a nail-size insect in their pork bone soup! Doesn't seem like a big deal for servers.  It's a surprise to me that they are still surviving. But definitely have a sense that they are losing business as compared to before.  Truly hope their owner will care about their customers a little more..."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for lunch with friends and we were disappointed with the lack of customer service. Our waitress was visibly annoyed after we asked for more side dishes (we asked for more side dishes a total of two times for the eight of us eating there). The way we were treated was cold and unwelcoming.   The food itself was average, I had the cold noodles, nothing about it stood out particularly. I would avoid this place when hanging around first Markham place in the future."}
{"text":"They're always cranky here, for no reason at all. I feel like they hate their jobs a little more than all the other wait staff in the other restaurants.  I've been going here since I was in high school since I'm such a 905-er and used to always stay in Markham for korean food (not a good idea). To be honest though, the korean food isn't bad here. Still authentic korean food with sizzling hot bowls. They offer a bunch of banchan dishes, and I love the jap chae and the bean sprouts. Nom. Back in my meat-eating days, I always got the gamjatang and I think it's one of the best around the city, although not the healthiest choice since it is a bit oily and dare I say it.. msg-ridden?! When I went back yesterday for the first time in foreeeever (cue the frozen song), I was surprised to see a new menu with more options! Tofu bibambap?! Yes please. It was a large portion and I was definitely full after eating it.   Service is incredibly slow, probably because they're so understaffed. They need more people working, especially in a full house.. don't know how they'd handle it with only 2 wait staff!?   I'd never willingly come here, unless in case of korean emergency. Aka, craving korean food, in proximity of FMP, and not willing to drive any further."}
{"text":"I've grown up surrounded by ethnic foods all my life and Korean is no exception. Today I decided to go out and entertain my cravings again and this restaurant came to mind. I'd been warned about its service in the past but was told the food was great so I took a chance.   It was pretty packed on arrival--a good sign that despite its service the food was good enough to merit a meal. For me a good pork bone soup (Gamjatgang) is a staple of any Korean restaurant.  Our first impression was pretty in sync with most of the negative reviews on yelp. It took us almost fifteen minutes for a server to show up at our table even though we'd paged them a few times using their table system. We were on the verge of leaving but the server came just as we were deciding to leave.  We ordered a broiled mackerel and two pork bone soups. When the food started coming, our impression flipped. The side dishes had a wide variety and were all very good (but not the best I've had to be honest). The Gamjatgang was fantastic. Despite not being the greatest among those I've enjoyed, it was still good. The pork was very tender and the soup had a well balanced amount of saltiness and spice.  This review would merit higher ratings if the service had been a bit faster, but overall it was filling, inexpensive, and tasty. Might revisit, not a guarantee."}
{"text":"I came to Nak Won against my will and do not let the overall  2 star score of this restaurant fool you. Ultimately this is an average Korean restaurant that will get the job done if you're not craving something too fancy or just want some dishes and some simple Korean dishes (with plenty of banchan).   I have to up my score for Nak Won because the main complaint of this restaurant, the customer service, has been completely pleasant this time around. They refilled all our side dishes 7(!) times, once even without asking. We managed to get extra lettuce for our BBQ and were even offered ice cream at the end. The ladies were pleasant and had a smile on their face. The food came out quickly as well even though it was quite busy.   If you're coming with a big group here, try to get the BBQ for three or for four if you're craving BBQ. You can all split it (regardless of how many people you brought) and it comes with plenty of other dishes like stews, rice (you can upgrade to bibimbap), and other dishes. It is a comprehensive meal that is enough for everyone. We came here with a group of six, and ordered the BBQ for three and seperate order of a naengmyeon + bossam combo and was quite satisfied overall.  It's the little details that matter. I was impressed with the BBQ this time around for including proper ssamjang, the sesame/salt sauces, and the sweet onion sauce. That's how it's supposed to be done, and a certain upgrade from last time where they didn't provide that."}
{"text":"The food is great, but horribly understaffed which results in bad service. They recently begin to limit you to only 1 round of refills on the side dishes."}
{"text":"love the appetizers! not a bad place for the lack of korean restaurants uptown.  highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pork tofu soup. When it came it was a pale beige colour. It tasted very bland like just hot water and tofu. I was trying not to be a difficult person but I had to send it back. I called the waitress over and she acknowledged to fix it for me but then she completely forgot! until we reminded her I was still waiting for my soup.   The same bowl of soup was brought back to me. The tofu was all broken into very small pieces, the chef must have stirred it vigorously. All they did in the kitchen was add more salt! The soup still have no flavour except it was very salty now! I was really disappointed and will not be returning again  I have been to restaurant once before about a year ago and it was actually ok and I ordered the same thing. I returned again a few nights ago and I was appalled...."}
{"text":"Been a frequent customer. Service can be slow due to busy times but I just help them out - paying at the counter, getting water etc myself. No big deal. Food is great"}
{"text":"Among the many Korean restaurants at First Markham Place, Nak Won offers the most variety of selections, from hot pot, BBQ, noodles, rice and soup. I've been here on numerous occasions and I have always left satisfied.  I just love the amount of appetizers you get with every meal. And they taste good too! Don't be afraid to order more because they get eaten quick!  My usual order is the Gam Ja Tang. They have many varations of soup (clear soup, chicken, tofu, kimchi, etc) but I find the pork bone soup to be the most consistently good. The bimbimbap is not served in a stone bowl, but rather in a plastic one. Disappointing. The sizzling plate (with your choice of spicy pork, chicken, beef) is always a good choice.   My friends ordered the Korean style bacon BBQ for 2. In the menu picture, it looked appetizing, but in reality. it's just big pieces of fat (30-35 pcs). It came with lettuce, but the amount of bacon grease that came out from the BBQ was disgusting and enough to send you to the hospital. Avoid at all costs.   Stick with their specialties as some dishes are a hit or a miss."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I crave for Korean foods..hmmm...pork bone soup...hmmm..seafood pancake...and PLUS all the free side dishes...make me happy!  I think this is either the 4th or 5th location and they are quite successful in building this Korean food place kingdom..in alot of areas...better than Owl..in terms of pricing and options..The pork bone soup here has a TON of meat....not a lot of boney meat..if that made any sense at all...LOL...  Keep refilling to side dishes..this is a very big restaurant, I'd always wonder how they manage to survive for so long when it's not actually super busy...  The seafood pancake is an A-OK, a little too much batter for my taste buds and the noodles are just an A-OK. I'm not Korean so I won't be able to tell what is really authentic and what is not...It's just all an A-Ok for me...  generally speaking, I will come back when I crave for korean spicy foods..."}
{"text":"best korean restaurant ive been to. great food great price. all orders comes with 7 sides: syrup skinned potato, fish cakes,  sweet potato vermicelli, kelp, kimchi, soy bean sprouts, and raddish.  i had pork bone soup and tempura. the pork bone soup has rice cake in it. the tempura is well breaded not too thin not too thick and still crispy. and the tempura sauce is cooled to the right temperature."}
{"text":"Don't go here. The server insisted on more tips even though the service wasn't satisfying and the food was not good either. I got the bibimbap and it was just so plain and dry. Recommend going to 100 percent Korean at steeles instead."}
{"text":"A friend took us there for a late lunch without checking yelp ratings. 2 stars, this is the beat I could rate. We had 3 people,they seated us in quickly but only set up the table for 2. And they didn't bring more utensils until we had to ask. My friend ordered pork bone soup, while they forgot to bring the rice. After my friend asked for the rice, it took them long time to bring the rice to the table, and it was not busy at all, only 3 or 4 table customers as I remember. I ordered the bibimbap, which I think was the worst I had had so far, it had no flavour and portion was small. All the food we ordered didn't look appealing. We regret going there. The price is not cheap either."}
{"text":"Checked in around a month ago and I have to admit, their service is really just not there.  I used to come quite often as there side dishes were relatively alright in selection as well as it was a quick fix within the Markham/Richmond Hill area for a korean crave.  However, I have to admit that it is now more like a BE WARNED type of restaurant where the premium for Korean food is definitely there as well as service is non existent.  Waitresses barely go out of their way to get you tea or water and when you do ask because it takes a literal 10 mins before they realized they forgot, they plop the whole jug and tell you to do it yourself and it was not even busy.  Also food was mixed as there are many other places that would treat you better as well as tastes better and hence, again I must warn that you would be foolish to come here.    So many other restaurants in the area and I used to hate owl as it was so generic, but this really topped the poll in terms of by far the worst Korean place you can go within the Markham area.  I would give the food an alright rating, however the service was just so abysmal, I can not see how it can be worse than this."}
{"text":"I would say this used to be my choice of food when it comes to Korean especially in the area. Although, they get super busy at night but wtih the amount of space and seating and also staff working, it was never a real problem. But over the years, I've noticed that they service has dropped a huge amount as well as the food.   Most recent experience I was here on Saturday night with my parents. There was a few people ahead of us waiting for a table already. There was no hostess or any staff keeping track who came first and a table for how many people. We waited until we were next in line and suddenly 2 men came in asking for a table and maybe they knew the server working there, so they took our table without waiting in line.  When we finally got our seats, we didn't get the menu or tea until we asked over 5 times. The side dishes didn't even come until all the food came and again with us asking over and over. The quality of food has certainly dropped a lot! It just tasted like some soup base with some meat and veggies thrown into a pot and boiled then served.   When we tried to get the attention of servers, we thought the button was the best thing invented but not when no one ever answers to it after seeing it. We had to press the button over 6 times and waited over 15 mins to get our bill.   The service is just very poor. Won't be my first go to Korean place in the area anymore."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3 star...and that is a compliment from before. In the past, this place has had mediocre food and horrible service; grumpy servers, unconventional rules and rude comments. The last time I unwillingly came, I was pleasantly surprised by a lack of rudeness. And this visit was the same. Ignoring the past (which is difficult to do), I agree with other reviews that the food is acceptable. Coming in, I expected a quick dinner of gamjatang for myself and kimchi jigae for my wife, a combination that we have had a million times the world over. And we were not disappointed because we expected the msg taste in the broth and minimal interaction with the staff. I was pleasantly surprise with 7 side dishes and no problems with the refills.  Solid 3 stars if nothing else changes. However, I would only come here if Food Express in the food court was closed and I didn't want to drive to Yonge St."}
{"text":"When I see Nak Won I think of THE Nak Won in Seoul, a massive \"never let engineers be architects\" type block building that sits astride a major road. Inside THE Nak Won are several floors of little musical instrument shops (http://joongangdaily.joins.com/_data/photo/2008/06/22224510.jpg). At the top of THE Nak Won is a movie theater that shows a lot of foreign (read English language) art house films. I caught Badlands (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069762/) there and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. That I could catch HHGTTG there while in Seoul means THE Nak Won and anything NAMED Nak Won has a very special place in my heart. Imagine reading in 1984 that a studio has optioned the Hitchhiker's inaccurately named trilogy. And you think, as a very innocent 18 year old, that Hollywood will surely turn out a movie in a couple years. And time passes. You get older. And fatter. And more cranky. And you learn the term \"development hell\". And there's never a HHGTTG movie to behold. And your life bottoms out. And you find yourself in Seoul and deliriously happy, living in a land where the subway goes everywhere, you can't understand what people at the neighboring Starbucks table are talking about, and you can  turn any English noun into a verb by simply adding \"Let's\" in front of it. And then the terrible news comes down to rob you of your happiness. The movie you've been waiting for since 1984 has been released to theaters. And you discover this movie doesn't have Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt-uh in it. Which means it probably won't make it to the local Megabox. Fuck.  But don't worry. THE Nak Won's rep theater showed it.   Pension Babe and I found ourselves in the First Markham Place mall complex. After coffee and trip to Home Depot, we decided to hit a Korean restaurant. Pension Babe let me take charge of ordering. She doesn't dig the spice so the kimchi chijae was out. I ordered the bulgogi, the naengmyeon, and the kimchi pancakes.  I've never been a fan of naengmyeon or soups in general. However, I found myself returning to the naengmyeon more than the bulgogi (pure meat). They really do the dish justice.   The banchan offers a good range. The odeng is some of the best I've had in Toronto.   And it turns out Nak Won doesn't mean \"big weird building full of musical instrument shops and a rep theater.\" It's Korean for \"paradise\". I learned that just now."}
{"text":"No lies, I've been avoiding this place because of the horrible Yelp rating and the fact that they don't seem to have any way to get rid of the smoke and heat from the BBQ's as most AYCE Korean Grill restaurants do.   We were sat in the fairly empty restaurant on a weeknight. They chose the table with a giant burned section smack in the middle. It was uneven and the worst part wasn't even the burned look (as you can see in the photo). It's the gross stuff caught under the burnt tiles. It's just so unsanitary and it would be an easy/cheap fix to just rip that stuff off and cover it back up.   Anyway, moving onto the food. I actually didn't catch any photos because we were apparently too hungry and just chowed right down. I really enjoyed the banchans they offered. Especially the pickled cucumbers. And I love that you pretty much get as many refills as you'd like because they only put 4-5 pieces per bowl.   We ordered a couple soups, bulgogi beef with rice, and one of their creamy black bean sauce noodles. The soups were great. Good flavour and lots of hardy meat to eat. So if we ever came back here, that's probably my top pick. The rest was a bit of a let down. The bulgogi was virtually flavourless and price was rather high for something so dry and tasteless. The noodles were good but their black bean sauce is very runny. It was definitely not creamy.. But I know many places make theirs differently and perhaps I just didn't prefer this location's version of this noodle.  Servers we had were very friendly though, but just a big hard to get their attention sometimes.   Over all, we have a lot more Korean food choices we can go to in the area. So I wouldn't think I'd be back. It wasn't horrible, but it just wasn't a great experience when you combine the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, except for the kalibi beef ribs (lot of bone and not alot of meat).  Appetizers are good too but portions are small.  Well, the appetizers are good that is, if you get them replenished.    The service is what really makes this place undesirable.  There are alot of staff and well, unless you speak Mandarin or korean good luck.  Pressing the button for service doesn't do anything, you can press and wait, and press and wait and no one will come by.  Even after flagging someone down they acknowledge you by giving you eye contact, raise their hand as if they are coming back to your request but the never do.  There is one tall server there with glasses and though her rudeness isn't outright it is off putting.  If you haven't eaten korean frequently to know the type of food, best of luck to you because they don't have any patience to explain it.  Too bad the service is terrible, otherwise the food is pretty good and reasonable $"}
{"text":"They Service : 1 / 5 Environment : 3 / 5 Food & Drinks : 1 / 5 Price : 3 / 5  Overall : 8 / 20  Comments - service was basically none existent - press the bell numerous times with no response.  (This seems to happen with the tables beside us as well).  - Order the pork bone soup: pork was luke warm at best, and the broth was overdosed with chili powder and oil.  Tofu soup was flavorless.   - Definitely had better service and korean food within the plaza, tofu house, owl ... etc ..."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars, I would. My 85 year old grandma ordered a dish with chicken and we literally got a teaspoon of shredded chicken for the price of $14. However, good for them for filling the bowl up with only rice and assorted veggies. When I asked a server in regards to the portion of the chicken, she was confused and gave me the impression that the portion was just fine. She later returned to the table and brought out a 1/2 teaspoon of shredded chicken and poured it onto my grandma's dish. Please do not come to this restaurant if you are looking into getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"Service here is so terrible. We came at 10:30pm and the restaurant closes at 11pm. The staff was rude to us the entire time from taking our order to bringing our food. I asked for another topping of sides and they didn't bring it for us, instead they brought us the bill and shooed us away."}
{"text":"We came here when there wasn't very many people in the restaurant, so the service was actually decent. Every time we rang the bell, someone was available.  Food was decent, not the best, but it was alright. Had some pork bone. Side dishes were terrible, so didn't eat much. Overall, it wasn't bad. I don't think I would return though."}
{"text":"Roaches and bad service - what more can i say?   I came in because I had a craving for pork bone soup. We ordered our food, it came, then the server was no where to be found. As my friend proceeded to pay at the counter, I saw a bug crawl out from the middle serving station and up a table leg. Upon watching it crawl across the floor and up a table leg for 2 minutes, completely shocked, and disgusted, I realized it was a roach. They were pretty lucky it was 2:30 PM on a Sunday and no one else was there to see this."}
{"text":"Food were salty, esp the pork bone soup. And my family and myself got diarrhea afterwards."}
{"text":"The Pork Bone Soup is very good there.  THey use more potatoe than most, but he soup is spicey, and the portions are very plentiful.  They have a doorbell botton on every table so you don't have to wave down a server....handy, but after a while, gets annoying.  The appetizers are plentiful.  I think you get 7 or 8 things (i.e. kimchi and the sort).  That's a treat because it keeps you busy while you wait for your food.  The spicy tofu soup is also very good...portions are smaller, but enough that you're not hungry...just not stuffed.  The decor is very clean (considering it is an asian restaurant) and the ceilings are high.  Lots of tables, so you don't have to wait.  All in all, a very respectable place, good food, very good value, and clean."}
{"text":"Over the year, I have tried this place. Their service remained the same, slow and sometimes rude.... When it comes to food, I am only giving 1 star because of their variety of small plate/snacks that comes for free. Food quality isn't consistent and their gamjantang seems like their soup is watered down/bland... cold noodle isn't that good compared to other Korean restaurant out there...Basically, for the price im paying in this restaurant is not the quality I am expecting when other restaurant are actually cheaper. Save your money and eat elsewhere... sorry Nak Won u really let me down."}
{"text":"This place had typical Korean food. But the service was horrible. I with I could give a zero star because they treated us like we were bothering them. We ordered spicy soup but my friend doesn't eat spicy so we asked if we could change. She said no rudely. Then later, our rice was poorly cooked so we asked for them to re make it. But she just microwaved it and also gave us a bad attitude. Later, I heard her  talking behind our backs saying we were causing trouble for them. Other things we asked for like bowls and chopsticks were given rudely to us. Overall, I was very displeased with the service and therefore will never come back ever"}
{"text":"I am a frequent goer of korean spots in Toronto but I didn't want to make the trip from Markham.   The parking lot was large, but it was still hard to find parking! There is just many other places in this plaza so you have many options!  The service was good to me and my date, they were tentative and answered my door bell rings promptly.    I ordered the pork bone soup and my date had the mackeral meal. A staple in korean restaurants. And boy did it hit the spot I needed while saving me the hour drive! The bowl was larger than most places I've been too and the taste was more than passable.   The price was good and they accepted all forms of payment. Worth it!"}
{"text":"Decided to give their AYCE a try and I am definitely not disappointed! $27.99 for the quality of meat you are getting you are definitely not losing out! I would eat the LA kalbi mostly but the rest of the options are great too! If you were to go to any mediocre K-bbq restaurants you would not get the same quality meat as what you will get at Nak Won. In the past they were also notoriously known for bad service, not this time. My husband and I were greeted by a very pleasant and attentive waitress. The place was also packed on a Sunday night! Hopefully more people will give this place another try get the ratings higher."}
{"text":"the food was bad, the waitresses were rude. worst service ever. I would honestly suggest you go somewhere else to get Korean food."}
{"text":"Huge restaurant with only 3 very unhappy staff. Took forever to get what we wanted. Prepared us the wrong dish, did not apologize for it, gave us a dirty look, and re-brought back to us the same dish with a few added glass noodles. Really not family and kid-friendly. Food is ok-good, but the experience was so bad that it was the only thing we took away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"If I could, I want to give this restaurant ZERO stars. I don't know how this place can still operate with this level of service and poor food quality. Save yourself money and time and just go somewhere else to eat. You will thank me later.   My friend and I came during a dinner rush hour. We were told there was going to be a 15 minutes wait.   We got seated quickly and menus were given to us. I decided to order the SamSun Jajang which is seafood black bean noodles while my friend ordered the pork bone soup. However, we had a hard time tracking down the waiter. He acknowledged we were ready to order by nodding his head and disappeared in the back o.O. Eventually he did came back and took our order (after our 2nd attempt).    Now to the main course. Have you seen angry food ? Well, this is my first time seeing angry food myself. The egg on top of my black bean noodles was inedible. The entire bottom layer of the egg was burnt. I don't remember asking for overdone eggs for my meal. The black bean sauce was way too salty and the \"seafood\" in the sauce was nonexistent. I could only taste the onions and overly salty sauce :(   Service was horrible. They were understaffed and the employees were flustered with the amount of work they have in hand. Maybe this restaurant was trying to save labour by cutting staff on a busy weekend night. They really need somebody to delegate tasks and have more staff to operate this business. I didn't see anybody in charge and poor staff members were just running around the store like lost mice. Relieve your staff members from this chaotic mess and they will give customers better service!   I definitely will NOT return to this restaurant. I came here a few times and always the same terrible service and the food are below average."}
{"text":"Why all the hate for this Nak Won? I have been to many Korean restaurants and its pretty standard to get the cold treatment from the waitresses. I agree that they give you the cold shoulder with no smiles but I found the service pretty fast and efficient. Went on a Wednesday afternoon and there were many seats available. From ordering the food it took less than 5 minutes to start seeing the side dishes arrive.  Got my usual pork bone soup for $6.99 and its on par with other Korean restaurants. Not overly salty which I like. Loads of pork bone and scolding hot as usual.   One reason why I love Nak Won is the number of side dishes they give you. Ten in total and one dish I could not even make out what it is. Side dishes are refillable as well which is a plus.   Also tried the grilled Mackerel for $5.99 which was surprisingly tasty. The fish was pretty large and the meat itself was moist.   For all the food you get and the rock bottom prices you just can't go wrong eating here.   Solid 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken on hotplate with rice for $12.99 this time around. Love all the side dishes they serve here and this time around they were all fairly fresh which is why I'm giving it a boosted rating. I have come here several times already and I find its consistently good and you can't beat the price for all the food you get."}
{"text":"honestly i only go to the Yonge and Finch location but decided to give this one a chance since I was in the area. Not surprised at all as to why it was so bleh because the other one that used to be in the kennedy area closed down because it was terrible. this location is fairly big and looks nice but really?! They couldn't even get the side dishes right... It tasted like nothing even though it looked like it was drenched in sauce and seasoning. Usually order the bulgolgi and Gamjatang (excuse my incorrect spelling) whenever i try a new place... Lets just say the bulgogi tasted like it was marinated with NOTHING and the pork bone bone soup looked like it was seasoned with NOTHING. the stars are merely for service and quality of the restaurants interior."}
{"text":"This location is pretty huge and the service there is pretty good. Nice food and all you can eat bbq. The price range is around $10-40. Depending on the food your eating. Nak won has multiple locations in Toronto. Overall, the food is 4/5 average"}
{"text":"I have been to many Nak Won restaurants across the Greater Toronto Area, but this location at First Markham Place has to be the WORST. I've been to this location for many years but I realized that their service and food is going downhill. Also, I think this place is way too understaffed for a Saturday night.   To start off, we got seated quickly and the waitress threw the menus onto the table... okay.. not off to a good start. Many waitresses walked by us with no smiles and didn't even bother glancing at our table. Didn't even bother asking if we wanted to order yet, also didn't give us any utensils/tea.  Took them 20 minutes to actually come and take our order. We even had to request for tea and utensils.   The food came within a reasonable time (I give them one star for that) but the food was okay. Eh, you can get better Korean food elsewhere.   When we wanted to get the bill, for some reason, they brought the bill over really quickly. No one came to get our payment, so I decided to go up to the counter to pay. The waitress up front started yelling at me if I wanted change and gave me a ton of attitude. Also, I asked if I could get a takeout box.. bu she proceeded to yell at me to get the box myself. I have never experienced such horrible service at any establishment in Markham."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with 2 other friends and I swear I will never come back to this restaurant again.   30 second review:  side dishes: 0 out of 5 stars.  Kalbi 4 out of 5 stars Pork Bone Soup 1/5 Bibimbap: 2 out of 5 Service: 0 out of 5 stars  Long review:  The service is just horrible. I eat a lot of Asian food so I am use to bad or non existent service, but this place is the worst of them all. The servers just waves her hand at us asking how many in an extremely rude way. While we were taking off our jackets and sitting down she just slams the menu on the table. After a few minutes we asked a different server to take our order, she didn't even ask us if we wanted the pork bone soup hot or mild. Before we could even tell her she ran off. Good thing she came back a minute later with the side dishes. We told her we wanted the soup to be spicy and she didn't even reply with a nod or yes. When we asked for a few extra bowls for sharing she kissed her teeth at us. Uhm, really? The worst part is, the place wasn't even full and when we were just finished the server slammed the bill on our table. I understand this is a Korean thing and I usually have no problems paying up and leaving if the place is packed and busy, but there was 5 other small tables that were empty!   Now let's talk about the disgusting side dishes. They have trays and trays of these side dishes already dished out and sitting on the counter uncovered for who knows how long. I find it extremely unsanitary and off putting especially when its the same direction as the washroom. The salad was just bad, the lettuce wilted and it was overdressed to the point that the dressing was falling off the lettuce when u try to eat it. The Kimchi was dry because it was sitting in the open for too long. The seaweed has a weird taste. Everything else was either overdressed or just tasted bad.   Kalbi was great, juicy, tender and good taste. Love the onions on the hot plate with a touch of sauce. Great when eaten with the rice. Would've been better if the side dishes were just as good.   Pork Bone soup is just bland and boring. We ordered the spicy so at least it had some heat to it. 1 piece of potato.   Bibimbap, this is one of those dishes u really can't mess up because it's just veggies, some meat, rice and hot sauce. While it's not bad, it's really not that great either. I've had better at other places and had the side dishes been better this dish would've tasted better with the sour veggies or kimchi.   I suggest to go to Owl of Minerva next door since their pork bone soup is much better and their service isn't bad either. All in all, I will not come back to this place for their bad service and bad food."}
{"text":"The two stars is purely for service. The lady that was serving us was great. Always smiling, nodding, answering our calls.   Food wise this place is no better than the FMP location. I knew Nak Won's Korean food isn't all that great so I ordered the safest dish BiBimBap. Sigh, if you could mess this dish up you seriously have issues. The rice in my BBB was overcooked so it turned out mushy after mixing it with the egg and sauce. I felt like I was eating congee. Friends ordered spicy squid, pork bone soup and sweet and sour pork. Sweet and sour pork was really hard, which means it went over when it was refried. Spicy squid wasn't that great either. Pork bone soup was bland and lacked the correct seasonings. Again, the side dishes weren't any better. I would much rather have 2 or 3 good side dishes over 8 or 9 mediocre or nasty side dishes.   If you enjoy cheap food with no standards of whats good, then this place is a good choice. If you enjoy some decent Korean food, there's more choices out there for a few dollars extra."}
{"text":"Worse place ever ! Second time I've came here 2 hours prior to closing and they don't want to serve.. Already making excuses they don't have food .. Then why stay open?? Don't ever go there people !"}
{"text":"I have yet to find another restaurant with a worse service than this place. I came to eat here with a party of 10 people, when the waitress came over she just threw down a piece of paper and a pencil and told us to write down our orders ourselves. The place wasn't even busy... All the waitresses there were impatient and grumpy. We were given 4 side dishes, which obviously went quickly since we had so many people, and when we asked for more side dishes it didn't come until 20 minutes later. When the dishes did come, the waitress impatiently slammed the dishes down on our table. After everyone paid for their food, the lady at the counter held us up because she messed up the numbers and insisted that some of us didn't pay. When i spoke up and tried to help her figure it out, she rudely said \"BE QUIET\" to me. I was so astonished, never in my life had i received such a service. After like 15 minutes the lady finally figured out her mistake and realized that everyone paid. But wait, that's not all.. The most unbelievable part was that she DEMANDED that we pay tips!!! When i calmly tried to explain that tips are earned for good service, she cut me off mid-sentence and actually YELLED at me, saying \"How do we not have good service?! We gave you all the food you ordered didnt we? Get out of here and never come back!!!\" To which I gladly agreed and has since never gone back.   Bottom line, this place needs to really reflect on their staff and customer service. Maybe hire some cheerful young people and fire the bitter racist tip-demanding old ladies."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting family. My cous-in-law suggested this place and he treated us. How disgusted we were. He almost ate the noodles with this huge bug!!! We told the waitress and she said \"oh sorry\" ... but she didnt offer to bring out a new plate or anything to replace!! So now comes our second dish ... wtf ... come on. We found this lil roach!! We got so disgusted ... told the waitress ... she says in a soft voice \"sorry\" ... takes the dish and walks away. NO REPLACEMENT!! After that we couldn't eat no more and we left. My husband said if he was there he would have went off at them. All I know that .. of course ... thats the last time Ill ever go there. HORRIBLE!! And all you had to say was SORRY??? It deserves ZERO STARS!!!! WHY CANT WE GIVE ZERO STARS WHEN WE HAVE PHOTO LIKE THESE and almost ate dirty bugs????"}
{"text":"Order two dinner sets pork bone soup with steam pork, kimchi soup with fish.   As my previous review, i still dont like their pork bone soup. The steam pork were ok, but only few pieces of lettuce which not enough for wrapping, donno if i can ask for more. But the worst was the fish, for sure it was precook n microwave after, the fish itself so fishy n dry, if you are reading this, DO NOT order that."}
{"text":"Love this Korean restaurant & have been here on numerous occasions. It never disappoints. The service is always fast & efficient & food is excellent & cheap!  I love how we get 7-8 dishes of little appetizers. Not sure why but it seems only the Yonge location will give an extra spicy cucumber appetizer dish but not the Richmond Hill. If you want more just ring them & they will get you more (yes there's a bell u can press & they'll come asap). The appetizers alone could make you full. Portion of the dishes can be large as well! No biggie.. packing again for lunch the next day :)  I usually order the the spicy tofu soup (choice of pork or seafood) or jachap (?) glass noodles w/ rice (this dish is HUGEEEE) or the rice in the stone pot (you can add in hot sauce yourself). Always look fwd to coming here."}
{"text":"This location's customer service is SO consistently bad that I subconsciously accepted that as the norm So when I went to LA and received above and beyond customer service by the Korean restaurants there, I quickly snapped out of it and realized this place treats their paying customers like craaappppppp and that's a problem! The workers act like the last thing they want to do is serve you yet that is what they are there for. The taste of the food here is also very inconsistent making my experience here only sometimes somewhat kind of enjoyable. There are actually a lot of Korean restaurants uptown and I don't know why I always gravitate towards this one, maybe because I used to frequent the Yonge and finch one. BUT moving forward I don't think I will be coming to this location to eat anymore.  p.s. Refer to the other reviews for specific examples of bad customer service from this place . Mine are similar so no need to reiterate :)"}
{"text":"2 stars because: 1) Price wasn't particularly cheap comparing to surrounding restaurants 2) Feels cold near the entrance 3) Food was \"meh\", nothing stands out 4) When we pay for the bill, they conveniently \"forgot\" to give us the change"}
{"text":"This is a place I come often since it's close to where I live and provides decent Korean food at a reasonable price. I've been here many, many times, don't expect high quality service when you get here. I've tried bulgogi beef and pork, the Bibimbap and the pork bone soups. There is usually a lot of seats because the restaurant is pretty massive, I've never had to wait when coming here. The decor is fairly plain and the service is sometimes slow even when there aren't a lot of people. I think there are more authentic and tastier Korean food places but this place is decent if you want decent Korean food that's cheap and decent."}
{"text":"The rating for this place is accurate. When the appetizers arrived everybody started digging in. We wanted some more potatoes and glass noodles so we asked the server. Right after we asked she puts the old glass noodle dish and just pours it into my plate without even asking me if I want to eat it. I felt so disgusted and unpleasant by then. When my food arrived I had the pork bone soup. I didn't really like the taste too much and it made my stomach feel uneasy. The food here sucks and the service is poor. Not recommended."}
{"text":"if there is zero or minus star i will definitely give it to them. We have been here for years. Now they change the owner, everything just can't be more worse. Food is bad, service is bad too. Don't recommend. And the fried beef, the beef is coming cold by smells. Omg terrible. And services are wiping floor when we come at 10. Bleach with food tasting. Perfect match"}
{"text":"This place used to be the go to place whenever I feel like having Korean food. But tonight's visit told me that it's time to go somewhere else.  I never had a problem with the service but tonight, I experienced the awful service that other reviewers here have posted.  The waitresses were rude from beginning to end. We were told to write our order on a piece of paper but we weren't provided a pen or paper.   Today was one of the hottest days. We had a party of 9 and only 1 bottle of cold water. Of course we would empty the bottle quite quickly and was asking the waitresses multiple times for a new bottle. We were ignored, one of them gave us the look as she passed by.  Not much to say about the food. It's the same for people who have visited before. Though the potato in my pork bone soup was a bit under cooked.  The service isn't worth the time or money. I will no longer visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went on a Monday lunch and it was pretty empty. Service was quick and easy especially as they have the buzzer to call a server. Got the pork bone soup for $7.99 and it was delicious! Wish they had purple rice but they serve white rice.   Lots of tables so I don't think it's much of a wait."}
{"text":"I have a lot experience with food from all over asia, but in no way am I proficient in Korean cuisine. This was actually my first visit at a Korean restaurant. Despite the absolutely terrible reviews, I decided I wanted to try it.   As many people have said, the servers are not that friendly. They seem a bit miserable and impatient. I wanted her to give me some suggestion for what was a good noodle based dish, so she told me flip to the chinese section and walked away. Hmmm...service definitely seems below standard on that one.   For starters we had katsu and tempura. I dont think these dishes are Korean at all- I dont like these restaurants that dabble into cuisine from all over asia. They are bound to get things wrong and it always ends up in disappointment.   The Don Katsu was not so great. The meat itself was good and crispy, but the sauce they used was unusual. It tasted lile tartar sauce so if you are a fan of that you will probably like it, otherwise dont get it. As for the tempura, it was good. Just like at a sushi joint :)  I myself ordered #71 (Bulgogi Jajangmyun? I copied it word for word). It was a huge portion so even at $14.99, I was happy with the size. I was expecting intense saltiness but it really didn't taste like anything. It didn't taste like it was seasoned at all which was unusual for me because most food from all over asia is rich in flavour. The noodles didn't really have any special characteristics either. Until I try a different Korean restaurant, I wont be able to strongly judge this dish but based off of what I tasted I know it could be better in some way."}
{"text":"I had none of the bad service experiences other's have mentioned. I went here with a group of 7 people and we were greeted at the door and assigned a table. The place was about 1/2 full but we had a very attentive server who answered our questions and was prompt whenever we needed anything.   Food was very good with a blend of chinese and korean dishes. The kimchi I had was good and we were provided multiple rounds of free appetizer dishes.  overall a good dinning experience. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Service is fairly poor for a Korean restaurant, but pretty good for a Chinese one.  Food, however, doesn't disappoint, with a wider than usual selection of Korean and Chinese-by-Korean favourites.  I should also add that the menu is very value-priced as well (lunch specials aside, even).  Very spacious and never seemingly crowded as well."}
{"text":"I get my pork bone soup fix whenever I'm here.   This place gives you a ton of meat, the soup is flavorful (slightly too much sodium/msg), ok sides dishes. It's not mind blowing but it does it job to fix my pbs cravings. I haven't tried much else tbh so hard to comment but from what I see other people ordering, the rest hasn't really caught my interest.  Service here can be better. They are understaffed for such a big place. On off hours it's ok (not great) but during a night run you are waiting a lot.  This for me is a once a month or every other month thing."}
{"text":"My first impression of this restaurant was that it was clean and spacious (since I had a large baby stroller and diaper bags ^^). The staff wasn't so friendly but the food came out pretty fast. I'm korean so I have to say the food wasn't so bad neither.  I guess when the waitresses knew I was korean they were more friendly with me and gave me more ban chan (side dishes) as I needed. I would definitely go back.  My recommendations: pork bone soup Hangover soup Chicken cutlet Seafood spicy noodle soup Blackbean sauce noodles"}
{"text":"Their food was at good quality and up to my standards. But the customer service was like a JOKE! I have never been so mad about a restaurant service before. My girlfriend and I waited more than 10 mins just for water. The worst part was when we were paying for the bill. The total came up at $27.24. I was already nice enough to put down $30.00 and the rest as tips for the horrible service. The lady came up to me and said that there is not enough tip. I was in shock! She gave me a rude look and walked away. If you want to be treated like a dog, this is the place to go...."}
{"text":"Firstly, I like the kimchi, bean curd, and potatoes in a sweet sauce side dishes in particular but all the other side dishes were good too. They were very nice about refilling them for us too :)  Pork bone soups had 3 large pieces of pork bone with a good amount of meat. Soup was mild-moderately spicy and not overly salty. Seafood pancake was pretty big but didn't have too much seafood in it. The dipping sauce nicely complements the pancake but overall, I felt like it was a little overpriced at $15.99.  Two waitresses working tonight. Younger lady was very nice and friendly and the older lady was a bit of a grouch. She wasn't rude or anything to us since we were mostly served by the younger lady but she was just perpetually frowning :(  They have a pretty extensive menu and the food is generally decent."}
{"text":"pros:  - Cheap - Ginormous number of appetizer dishes refillable at will - Fast, clean, lots of space - Good food, though not the most authentic Korean food I've had  Cons - Service is unfriendly - Always a bitch to find parking in fmp - Good food, though not the most authentic Korean food I've had  _____"}
{"text":"Frigid Wife, thy name is \"Korean Waitress\".    If I account for service at this restaurant it is easily a 1 star out of 5 review. But since I willingly chose a Korean restaurant and walked in with my eyes wide open, ofcourse I was already aware that service will be  non-existent. What I wanted was CHEAP Korean food. Which means I also reluctantly want cheap Korean service.  The dolsot bibimbap came piping hot, was slightly better than average because they used some kind of fermented bean or fish in the spicy sauce flavoring. The bulgogi was pretty good and more than enough to take home for leftovers.  As for the side dishes, at first taste something felt \"off\" as if they were not \"flavorful\" enough (not enough sesame oil, not enough spice, not enough soy, not enough vinegar). But on second thought after conferring with my dining partner, we realized it's not \"off\", but in fact the side dishes were more akin to what you'd end up making at home if you were quickly tossing together some ingredients, and the flavor that was lacking is actually the \"processed\" flavor---one akin to what you get used to eating if you always buy korean side dishes premade and packaged in little plastic square containers and jars.  Service tips - don't use the buzzer button at your table if you need stuff: you can try it 1-2 times out of respect for the rules :)  but get up, meander about, and look for your missing utensils, plates, bowls, chopsticks, takeout boxes yourself! It saves you the trouble of getting all in a huff about nothing significant, and also gives you a very good reason for tipping them less than they deserve."}
{"text":"Okay, firstly, I will give this place the fact that they do offer very cheap Korean food.  This place does offer various Korean dishes at a very affordable price.  However,  the service here is the WORST service in the GTA.  I have been here a few times and every time they are incredibly understaffed.  They have 3 waitresses waiting on almost 30 tables, which is completely insane.  As such, the waitresses are incredibly rude to you and really do not care about your food or your request.  Do not come here if you want any type of customer service, you will get none.  You actually feel bad for asking the waitress for more tea.  She will give you cut eye.  You actually feel unwanted in this restaurant."}
{"text":"We asked to refill some of our side dish. The waitress's response was \"Later! later! we are too busy right now.\" In a tone that it's like we just asked for the most rediculous thing in the world, left and never came back. Oops sorry for making you busy, won't happen again! :) 1 star is for the food , but honestly you have way too many options in that area, try another Korean restaurant that actually has some service."}
{"text":"AVOID COMING HERE DURING THE WEEKEND AND HOLIDAY DINNER.   Service here is SLOW. The food overall here is pretty good, the portions are big. But the anticipation waiting for a server to take our order and grabbing the bill is really frustrating!!!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd location of Nak Won Korean Restaurant. I never been to the other location so this place is new to me. It is located in the plaza of First Markham Place.  When I got there around 11:30 AM for an early lunch, there was only 1 table occupied.  There are lunch specials starting from $6.99 (see photos for the special). I ordered the Took Baei Bulgoki (Seasoned Marinated Sirloin Beef in a hot stone bowel serving with rice - try saying that in 1 breathe!)  The meals came with 7 different appetitizers and salad. I was half full after eating those.... Then the beef arrived bubbling hot... like a little volcano! For $7.99 that is a lot of food!!!   The beef tasted really tender and the soup was great! BTW the rice is white rice, I am not sure if they have the option of brown rice instead.  Since most of the lunch specials are non spicy. I have to add Korean Chilli Sauce on it to make my meal complete.  The services were fast and efficient. A little indifference, not polite, not rude.  They accepts credit cards."}
{"text":"Nak Won Restaurant just opened up its third location replacing the Tofu Village at New Kennedy Centre.   I am glad that Nak Won is openning up another location up North aside from the one at First Markham Place. However, I do like Tofu Village better.  When Nak Won moved into this location, not much renovation is needed. All they did is took out all those huge photos of Korean dishes on the wall..and references to Tofu Village.  The menu is similar to the other Nak Won location. With lunch specials starting at $5.99 including all the banchans! What a steal!  Since I have craving for cold noodles so I decided on the Korean Cold Noodle Soup ($8.99) instead. They do offer the one with no soup but mixed with sweet and spicy sauce.  The banchans at Nak Won is always good and plentiful. The cold noodles arrived shortly. The size is a bigger than other Korean restaurant I been to, garnished with marinated cucumber, apples slice, beef and ice cube. I feel like I am eating a bowl of bottomless noodles because I was full after eating half of it! There is also vinegar and mustard to add in if you prefer to have a stronger taste.  The noodles are the chewy type..and does have a lot of bite to it. I am always a noodle fans so I really enjoy eating it!  The services is cold and impersonal without a smile as always.. but you get your food fast and is cheap. In and out with no fuss!  They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"Distinctively terrible, mostly due to the nonexistent service.  I came here with a group of friends. We were seated at the table and then completely ignored for about 25 minutes, nobody came to ask us if we wanted tea or anything. They gave us menus and blank slips of paper and expected us to write down what we wanted. The waitresses would not come to the table at all unless we rang the bell for service.   Since I don't actually like Korean food all that much but my friends do, I tried to order some more Western dishes like spring rolls, dumplings and meat skewers, only to be told that each of them was unavailable. I tried a couple more things before giving up and just asking for a bowl of plain rice.   At the end of all this, they were very rude and annoyed when we asked for separate checks."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't write a bad review but our experience was actually so bad it was funny. We have eaten there before (thus the *) and the food was decent so we decided to try again. 40 minutes after arriving we still hadn't received any tea, water, banchan or our order. We finally flagged down a waitress (you might have better luck finding a cab in NY), and asked her to check on our order. She went to check and never came back to tell us (?!) and went about doing her thing. We asked a second waitstaff who was courteous but he told us they gave our order to someone else so we just left for fear we might waste another 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Before writing this review, I'd like to say that Ive given this restaurant multiple chances over the years. I am not usually someone who demands top of the line service. If anything, I only ask for service in order to place an order, maybe for a refill of water, and then for the bill.  I understand asian restaurants tend to be quick and blunt in order to get their customers in and out, but the staff here is just plain rude. I have come back once every year or so thinking that it has changed for the better, but it is as if they train the new staff to be just as rude as the previous staff.   In addition to slow and rude service (and I mean SLOW. Takes about 10 minutes to even get someone's attention), I will list the multiple instances where my party and I were treated unkindly. - Waitress was shocked that we did not give a tip at the end and demanded that we do not leave without giving a tip.  - When asking for refills on their side dishes, would be told that we don't need new dishes because we've finished our food. - In another instance, when asking for refills on dishes, waitress would slam down (and i mean she slammed the plates down and food would fly) the dishes and would walk away without acknowledging the mess she made. - When asked to help our party take a picture, waitress would say the restaurant is too busy and that they do not provide this service. (Restaurant was half empty and she was previously chatting with other staff which was why we asked in the first place).   Note that each experience was at a different time over the years which is why I have come to hate this place.   I can't speak for other locations so I hope that it is much better elsewhere because the food is decent (though it is nothing too special). The side dishes they provide are some of the better options I've seen in Korean restaurants though, which is why I usually ask for more.   If it wasn't for the experiences Ive had, I would come to think this is a place I would visit every so often. Hopefully others have had better experiences than I have, but unfortunately, I have to give this place a 1/5."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY BAD SERVICES!!! The food is ok and average price. But the service is extremly poor.  I had never forced to leave a restaurant before. As I was working late and hope to find a place that opens later. They suppose to close at 11pm, and start pushing me to leave a 11:00 sharp. 3 waitress approached me and start collecting dishes as soon as I finish eating them. They keep on telling me that they close at 11:00 and demanded me to finish eating right away.   I paid the bill 10min before they close, which I thought was fair since they need to close. But I was really regret that I already paid their tips with such EXTREME POOR SERVICE.  I told them I will never return to this place again, and they dare to reply. \"That only 1 customer we lost!! We don't want to do your business too.\""}
{"text":"Terrible service, period. Ask for a baby chair? Get it yourself. I've ate here many times over the years and it's the same terrible service all these years."}
{"text":"Staff are happier and more polite than the one at fmp. A smaller restaurant compared to fmp as well but it's much more cosy and quiet here. The food is the same as the fmp location. Side dishes are great. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten worse since the last time I came. I got the tookbaegi bulgogi (9.99) during lunch and the beef was super rough and was not as flavourful as before.   I would rather go to Owl of Minerva at FMP instead."}
{"text":"I used to go to another Korean restaurant in the same plaza but since it closed down, I decided to go to Nak Wan. I've been a couple of times now and I quite like it, despite the low reviews.   I usually go after work and get there just before 6pm. I'm always able to get a seat easily but I have noticed that the restaurant fills up pretty fast soon after.   I've tried the beef bulgogi, bibambap, cold noodles, and rice cakes. So far I've liked everything that I've tried. The prices are reasonable and service is quick too if you're looking for a fast meal. The rice cake can be quite spicy so I'd only order that again if I'm sharing it with others.   The appetizers that they serve are also delicious. I looove the appetizers more than the food!   They also offer AYCE KBBQ, but I haven't tried that yet."}
{"text":"I love how they had 9 side dishes. What I didn't like was that they gave me the wrong order. I ordered seafood tofu soup but they gave me the pork tofu soup instead. Overall the food wasn't that bad. I wouldn't mind going again, but it was pretty typical Korean food! Their service may need to raise. I went on a weekday, night, it wasn't busy, but it took them a while to come and take the bill, my friend and I ended up breaking the bill ourselves."}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed by the food quality at this Nakwon branch. It was bland and plain. It's a great place for average and cheap Korean food"}
{"text":"I like the food! I like the big menu... many choices... and the price was reasonable. I know nothing about Korean food, and today was my 2nd time eating it (aside from Korean BBQ), and I liked my dinner that night. I didn't notice dirty food or anything.. the place looked clean. The washrooms were alright too :) Every table had a buzzer to call for service, which was convenient.  YET... 1 star, why?? Aside from the food, I hate the service!! I'm NEVER going back!! We asked for water, and she slammed a water pitcher (a $5 plastic water bottle found in Asian markets) on our table. No cups??   We asked for napkins and he dumped a pile right in front of my friend,.. wtf. Gently, maybe?  And we asked her to take a photo for us, and she had this \"omfg why am i doing this for you\" look. She took it when no one was ready, gave the camera back to us so we couldn't ask her to take another, and walked away pissed. WE should be pissed! The picture was blurry!   Basically, the service was \"hurried\" and rude. And NO, the restaurant wasn't busy at all! There were only 3-4 other tables (and about 10 empty ones). There were at least 4 waiters (3 different ones served us).  So we decided to leave them no tips, but of course it doesn't end... one waiter came running out demanding more. ARGG   good food, but no."}
{"text":"AYCE bbq worked well for my wife and I. As c=*\×o meat quality went down, my wife and I had to look for another AYCE Korean BBQ place that served short ribs and Nak Won did just that!   Staff were fast, and attentive, food was good.  LA galbi was a lot better than I expected, but it did make the grill start burning real fast due to sugar in the marinade, but we never had to ask for the grill change as the staff changed the grill right away on their own.  I know the place has been known for bad and slow service before, but it seems like they are either under new management or they've stepped up their game.  None the less, if you haven't tried for a while, give them a try tonight."}
