{"text":"This place has the best carribean food.  It appears like a lemonade stand but they serve slow roast on a kaiser, roti, jerk chicken wrap, and these amazing snacks called doubles for $2.50.  The doubles are chick peas and chutney in between two chapati like patties the size of a burger.  I accidentally encountered this place during the jazz festival next to Roy Thompson square.  I have yet to try their lemonade.    The roti was $9 and comes with a side of coleslaw.  It is a bit pricey but the taste is authentic.  This is a hidden gem that only gets advertised through word of mouth since there is no advertising whatsoever.  You can ask them to add some spinach in the doubles.  They might do it if you are nice to them.  On top of that, the place sells ice cream waffle sandwiches that are hot, sweet, and crispy...very delicious.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Found this place randomly while walking to the subway from a Jays' game on a sweltering day. What a GODSEND! I had the vanilla lemonade and could have had about three of them. Just sweet enough to go down easily. My partner had the regular lemonade and it was too tart for my taste, but perfect for his. I will go out of my way to come to this place all summer."}
{"text":"Very very good doubles. I gotta try the rest of the food. They also have roti sliders and soups it seems. Not really a restaurant but very nice people."}
{"text":"If i could give this place more than 5 stars i would! My only regret is not buying more!!!! These doubles were the best i have ever had, sweet and savory all in one. The employee at the founter was incredibly helpful. I actually tried going back the next day but they were closed for the day. We tried even the following day, but they were still closed! I tried heading downtown to another place but their doubles were so spicy that I could not even eat it. I was so sad lol. The next time i return to Toronto i will be sure to buy enough to take back to NY!!!! Amazing doubles!!!"}
{"text":"I typically never leave reviews but simply could not do so for La Limonada without feeling guilty. Hidden in the basement of a small church, it has the most satisfying doubles you can find in the city. Perfect comfort food."}
{"text":"Reasonable doubles (just less than $3 after tax), the vegetarian roti was good, but a bit small and expensive for what it was."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food in an unlikely spot.   Walk through the church's back door, head down the steps, and then make a beeline to the little order window in the back.   It's worth a little wandering for the best doubles ever. Savory and spicy, sweet and sour, all the best things in life smashed together in tender little baras (fried pancakes) with crispy edges and tamarind chutney. Just unbelievably good. The roti was wonderful too, but I would probably double down on doubles in the future. Vegans, rejoice! This is easily one of the best veg meals in Toronto, both quick and affordable. It's especially appreciated given the lack of good options in the neighborhood.   The proprietor is lovely, and made us feel right at home. I can't wait to enjoy more of her food!"}
{"text":"Well,  a friend has been after me to go to this place. Finally, tried it today! I have nothing to compare it to as I've never had either Jerk Chicken or Trini Chickpea Doubles......both were extremely tasty and just spicy enough pour  moi!   But, I'm pretty sure I could live on the Doubles!  The Jerk Chicken and Trini Doubles Virgin"}
